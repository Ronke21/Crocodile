<text>The genus Ophrys is a large group of orchids from the alliance Orchis in the subtribe Orchidinae. They are widespread across much of Europe, North Africa, Caucasus, the Canary Islands, and the Middle East as far east as Turkmenistan.

These plants are remarkable in that they successfully reproduce through pseudocopulation, that is, their flowers mimic female insects to such a degree that amorous males are fooled into mating with the flowers, thereby pollinating them. There are many natural hybrids.

They are referred to as the &quot;bee orchids&quot; due to the flowers of some species resemblance to the furry bodies of bees and other insects. Their scientific name &quot;Ophrys&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;eyebrow&quot;, referring to the furry edges of the lips of several species.

&quot;Ophrys&quot; was first mentioned in the book &quot;Natural History&quot; by Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD).

== Biology ==

They are terrestrial or ground orchids from central to South Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor, up to the Caucasus Mountains, but mostly in the Mediterranean region. They have been said to be the most important group of European terrestrial orchids.

During summer, all &quot;Ophrys&quot; orchids are dormant as underground bulbous tubers, which serve as a food reserve. In late summer/autumn they develop a rosette of leaves. Also a new tuber starts to grow and matures until the following spring; the old tuber slowly dies. The next spring the flowering stem starts to grow. During flowering the leaves have already started to wither.

&quot;Ophrys&quot; like other orchids are dependent on symbiotic fungi at some point during their life cycle, but especially for germination, which may take months or even years underground. Orchid roots contain Orchid mycorrhiza, coils of fungal hyphae inside orchid root cells. 

Transplanting specimens, especially wild specimens, is difficult, sometimes impossible, due to this symbiosis unless a large amount of surrounding earth is also taken with the plant. 
All orchids are protected under CITES II and should not be removed or disturbed in habitat.

The shiny, basal leaves have a green or bluish color. Two to twelve flowers grow on an erect stem with basal leaves. These species are successfully cultivated by specialist growers of terrestrial orchids and are reported to be difficult to grow, being sensitive to rotting and damping off diseases if not properly subjected to a cool and dry aestivation period over the summer months with no water.

=== Pollination ===
Orchids of the genus &quot;Ophrys&quot; use sexual deception to attract pollinators to their flowers. In sexual deception, an orchid attracts male pollinators by producing the sex pheromone of virgin female pollinators in addition to providing visual and tactile cues. These signals stimulate mating behavior in the male pollinators, which then attempt copulation, called &quot;pseudocopulation&quot;, with the orchid labellum. During pseudocopulation, pollen from the flower&#x27;s column becomes attached to some part of the pollinator, usually the head or abdomen, and the pollinator inadvertently carries and transfers this pollen to other flowers when they are once again enticed into pseudocopulation. While the morphological cues such as the shape and texture of the labellum play a role especially at close range in inducing the pollinator mating behavior, the orchid&#x27;s pheromone mimic, or allomone, has been shown to play the most important role in enticing pollinators to the flower.

The allomone produced by an orchid is specific to its pollinator, of which it usually only has one. The allomone is a mixture of alkenes and alkanes. There are one or more active species in this mixture that account for the attraction of pollinators. Pollinators and orchids use the same chemical compounds in the same absolute amounts in their pheromones and allomones, respectively.

Every &quot;Ophrys&quot; orchid has its own pollinator insect and is completely dependent on this species for its survival. Duped males are less likely to return and may ignore other plants of the same species. Only about 10% of an &quot;Ophrys&quot; population gets pollinated. This is enough to preserve the population, since each &quot;Ophrys&quot; orchid produces about 12,000 minute seeds.

== Species ==

Almost 2,000 names have been proposed for species, subspecies, and &quot;nothospecies&quot; (i.e. species of hybrid origin) within the genus. The number of species recognized varies very widely between authorities. &quot;Flora Europaea&quot; in 1980 and Pedersen &amp; Faurholdt in 2007 listed about 20 species in Europe as a whole; Buttler in 1991 increased this to 53 for slightly larger geographical area; Delforge in 1995 gave a total of 130 species. By contrast, a molecular phylogenetic study in 2008 suggested that there were around 10 distinguishable groups.

<text>Gymnadenia is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae) containing 22 terrestrial species. The former genus Nigritella is now included in &quot;Gymnadenia&quot;.

They can be found in damp meadows, fens and marshes, and on chalk or limestone, often in alpine regions of Europe and Asia from Portugal to Kamchatka, including China, Japan, Mongolia, Siberia, the Himalayas, Iran, Ukraine, Germany, Scandinavia, Great Britain, etc. The fragrant orchid (&quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot;) has been introduced into the USA and is reportedly naturalized in Connecticut.

These hardy terrestrial orchids are deciduous. They survive the winter through two deep-cut tubers. Long lanceolate green leaves grow at the bottom of the stem. There are some small leaves at the stop of the stem.

They flower during the summer. The inflorescence is a dense cylindrical spike between 5 and 30 cm long. It can consists of up to 150 small pleasant-smelling flowers. It is recently discovered that eugenol and isoeugenol, floral volatile scent compounds, are catalyzed by single type of enzyme in &quot;Gymnadenia&quot; species and gene encoding for this enzyme is first functionally characterized gene in this species so far. Their color can vary from pale purple to pink and white. The lip is wide with three lobes. The marginal petals are horizontal. There is a long, thin, threadlike spur.

Several species were formerly classified under &quot;Nigritella&quot;. The nothogeneric name ×&quot;Gymnigritella&quot; was used for hybrids between these two groups.

<text>The University of Tartu (UT; ; ) is a public research university located in the city of Tartu, Estonia. It is the national university of Estonia. It is also the largest and oldest university in the country. The university was founded under the name of &quot;Academia Gustaviana&quot; in 1632 by Baron Johan Skytte, the Governor-General of Swedish Livonia, Ingria, and Karelia, with the required ratification provided by King Gustavus Adolphus, shortly before the king&#x27;s death on 6 November in the Battle of Lützen (1632).

Nearly 14,300 students study at the university, of whom over 1,800 are foreigners. Most of the curriculum is instructed in Estonian. However, there are still 30 English-taught programs: three at the undergraduate level and 27 at the master&#x27;s level, including the Erasmus Mundus program in Excellence in Analytical Chemistry.

The historical buildings of the university are included in the European Heritage Label list as &quot;embodiment of the ideas of a university in the Age of Enlightenment&quot;. The university is a member of the Coimbra Group and the Utrecht Network.

The mascot of the university is called Tiksu, and behind it unravels a rather interesting story. It is said that Tiksu, depicted as a blue bird, hatched at sunrise and was given a thirst for learning new things. In this way, it symbolizes knowledge and intelligence. Later on, Tiksu is said to have met an ornithologist who also gave lectures at a university. Thus, one day the little bird followed his new friend to the place where he worked and managed to get inside a classroom. There he listened to lectures and learnt new information about birds. After some time, he became a part of the university family. Of course, the story consists of an imaginary tale, as Tiksu can speak and communicate with humans, but easily gets the message of the university across: the interest of their students for knowledge and life.

==History==

===Academia Gustaviana===
The university was originally founded as the &quot;Academia Gustaviana&quot; in the Swedish province of Livonia. It was the second university founded in the Swedish Empire, following Uppsala University (in Uppsala, Sweden proper) and preceding the Academy of Åbo (in Turku, Finland). A precursor to the academy had been a Jesuit grammar school &quot;Gymnasium Dorpatense&quot;, founded by Stefan Batory (then king of Poland–Lithuania) in 1583 and existing to 1601, when Tartu (Dorpat) was under Polish–Lithuanian rule.

The first students matriculated between 20 and 21 April 1632. The opening ceremony of Academia Dorpatensis (Academia Gustaviana) took place on 15 October in the same year. The academy in Tartu functioned with philosophy, law, theology, and medical faculties enjoying the privileges of the University of Uppsala. On account of the Russian–Swedish war, the University of Tartu moved to Tallinn in 1656, and in 1665, it closed down. In the 17th century, the future outstanding Swedish scholars Urban Hiärne, Olof Verelius, , and others studied at the university. Among the academic staff were , professor of history (the history of Livonia, the first scientific approach to Estonian folklore) and Georg Mancelius, professor of theology (author of the first Latvian-German dictionary in 1638).

With the re-establishment of the university in 1690 as the &quot;Academia Gustavo-Carolina&quot;, Tartu became a university town again. Academic staff of the new university included , professor of mathematics (the first in the world to deliver lectures based on Newton&#x27;s theory), , professor of rhetoric and poetry, , professor of medicine (founder of balneology, and discoverer of natural mineral water springs) and Michael Dau, professor of philosophy as well as of rhetoric and poetry. Just under a decade after being reconstituted, as a result of the coalition against Sweden (Russia, Denmark-Norway, and Saxony-Poland-Lithuania) and the Great Famine of 1695–1697, the university moved from Tartu to Pärnu. Eventually, Academia Gustavo-Carolina, which had opened in Pärnu on 28 August 1699, was closed as a result of the surrender of Pärnu to Russian forces on 12 August 1710 during the Great Northern War. According to the terms of the capitulation, the Russians agreed to maintain the university in Pärnu. However, the university was only reopened in 1802 by the Baltic German &quot;Ritterschaften&quot;, when the new German-speaking University was relaunched and had its new charter confirmed by the reform-minded Tsar Alexander I of Russia.

=== Universität Dorpat ===


The university was reopened by the Baltic Germans in Estonia in April 1802. The language of instruction at Dorpat was German from 1802 to 1893. During that time, Dorpat had a dual nature in that it belonged both to the set of German(-language) and Russian universities. Financially and administratively, the latter was more important; intellectually and regarding the professoriate and students, the former was more important (over half the professors came from Germany, at least another third were Baltic Germans). Among the 30 German-language universities, of which 23 were inside the German Empire, Dorpat was the 11th in size. In teaching, the university educated the local Baltic German leadership and professional classes, as well as staff, especially for the administration and health system of the entire Russian Empire. In scholarship, it was an international university; the time between 1860 and 1880 was its &quot;golden age&quot;.

The freedom to be a half-German university ceased with the rise of nationalist tendencies in Russia, which held homogenization more important than retaining a bilingual university. Between 1882 and 1898, russification in language, appointments, etc., was imposed, with some exceptions (such as the Divinity School, which the state feared would be used by the Orthodox clergy to teach dangerous Protestant views and was thus allowed to continue in German until 1916). By 1898, when both the town and the university were renamed Yuryev, virtually all distinguished scholars from Germany had left. The University of Yuryev existed until 1918, when during part of the fall term, it was reopened, under German occupation, as Dorpat. Russian academic staff and students took refuge in Voronezh in Russia, giving rise to the foundation of Voronezh State University, which traces its own history back to the foundation of the University of Tartu and still holds several physical properties of the latter.

=== University of Tartu (1919–) ===
Since Estonia became independent in 1918, the University of Tartu has been an Estonian-language institution since 1919. The university was named Ostland-Universität in Dorpat during the German occupation of Estonia in 1941–1944 and Tartu State University (Estonian: &quot;Tartu Riiklik Ülikool&quot;) in 1940–1941 and 1944–1989, during the Soviet occupation. During Soviet rule, although Estonian remained the principal language of instruction, some courses were taught in Russian, with several Russian curricula. Estonia regained independence in 1991, and the full recovery of academic autonomy of the university can be dated to 1992 with the introduction of financial and academic strategic planning. Presently, no courses are taught in Russian.
The last decade has been marked by organizational and structural changes, as well as adaptations to various university models (American, Scandinavian, German) against the background of the Soviet and Baltic German past. Most recently, the university has been and is still being marked by the adaptation of the Bologna declaration in Estonia generally and Tartu specifically, leading to major changes in curricula and studies, as well as by strong organizational centralization attempts. Recent plans also include the abolition of the Chair system (an Americanization) and of the faculties, which is supposed to lead to four large divisions (humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and medicine) under briefly serving deans and rector-appointed financial administrators.

==Buildings==

The university&#x27;s four museums, botanical gardens, and sports facilities are, by and large, open to the general public. The university possesses 56 buildings, 11 of which are outside of Tartu; 31 of its buildings decorate the city as architectural monuments. In May 2023, the University of Tartu relaunched its virtual tour that has 360-degree photos of over 160 locations in the University campus.

At the same time, numerous university buildings and student dormitories have been recently constructed or renovated, such as the Von Bock House. Many of the new buildings are built at Maarjamõisa (about 2 km southwest of the historical university centre), such as the Technology Institute, the Biomedical Center, the Chemistry building, and the new Physics building.

==Research==

Lectinology, the science of lectins, was founded at the University of Tartu in 1888 with the publication of Peter Hermann Stillmark&#x27;s thesis about the isolation of ricin.

According to the university administration, the most remarkable recent research achievements have been in the fields of molecular and cell biology, laser medicine, materials science, laser spectroscopy, biochemistry, and psychology.

UT is the flagship of Estonian science, ranking in the top 1% of the world&#x27;s most-cited universities and research institutions in these fields (as of March 2018):

*Clinical medicine
*Chemistry
*Environment and ecology
*Geoscience
*Plant and animal science
*Social sciences
*Molecular biology and genetics
*Biology and biochemistry
*Neuroscience and behaviour
*Psychiatry and psychology.

UT accounts for 56% of Estonia&#x27;s national research output. Also, more than half of the PhD theses in Estonia are defended at UT and over 2,000 high-level research articles (those covered by citation indices like &quot;SCI Expanded&quot;, &quot;SSCI&quot;, or &quot;A&amp;HCI&quot;) are published annually. About 50 UT scientists are among the top 1% of the most-cited scientists in the world.

UT has excelled among the Baltic universities in winning European Research Council grants. The prestigious ERC grant has been awarded to Professor of Molecular Systems Biology Mart Loog, Professor of Nanomedicine Tambet Teesalu, and Professor of International Law Lauri Mälksoo.

== Entrepreneurship ==

University of Tartu has contracts with 154 business partners in the amount of 10.2 million euros. UT is one of the largest development partners for the private and public sector in the Baltics. The university also works closely with international businesses such as Swedbank, The Linde Group, Pfizer, ABB Corporate Research, SUPER APPLI Inc, Eesti Energia Group, Telia AS, and many more.

UT has spun off more than 60 start-ups, including software companies Reach-U and Positium providing location-based solutions, biotechnology company Icosagen etc. The success story of the last 15 years is the technology for the ME-3 strain of &quot;Lactobacillus fermentum bacterium&quot;, allowing its use in the food industry. Student satellite ESTCube-1, developed collectively by UT staff and students, and successfully deployed into orbit in 2013, made Estonia the 41st space nation in the world. Scientists from UT and the Estonian University of Life Sciences have developed a new peat-based material that enables building inexpensive energy-efficient 3D-printed houses. The innovative robotic mannequin technology known as Rakuten Fits Me, a virtual dressing room, was originally developed in cooperation with researchers of UT Institute of Technology.

UT encourages its students and scholars to develop an entrepreneurial mindset and apply their knowledge to the economy. The university has set a goal to integrate entrepreneurship courses into every curriculum.

<text>Anacamptis is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae); it is often abbreviated as Ant in horticulture. This genus was established by Louis Claude Richard in 1817; the type species is the pyramidal orchid (&quot;A. pyramidalis&quot;) and it nowadays contains about one-third of the species placed in the &quot;wastebin genus&quot; &quot;Orchis&quot; before this was split up at the end of the 20th century, among them many that are of hybrid origin. The genus&#x27; scientific name is derived from the Greek word &quot;anakamptein&quot;, meaning &quot;to bend backwards&quot;.

These terrestrial orchids occur on grasslands, limestone or chalk deposits, or on dunes in Eurasia, from the Mediterranean region to Central Asia.

==Systematics==
Except the pyramidal orchid (&quot;A. pyramidalis&quot;), all species of &quot;Anacamptis&quot; seem to form a clade around the green-veined orchid (&quot;A. morio&quot;). They have a diploid chromosome number of 32 or 36. A useful character for distinguishing &quot;Anacamptis&quot; from &quot;Orchis&quot; – where the green-veined orchid clade was formerly included – is the basal fusion of the three sepals in &quot;Anacamptis&quot;.

The few bigeneric hybrids are typically between closely related genera, in particular &quot;Serapias&quot;. Hybrids between the pyramidal orchid and the early purple orchid (&quot;Orchis mascula&quot;), found in Cumbria (UK) in 1997, proved short-lived because of the highly divergent genomic lineages of the parents.

<text>The Royal Academy of Turku or the Royal Academy of Åbo ( or ; ; ) was the first university in Finland, and the only Finnish university that was founded when the country still was a part of Sweden. It was founded in 1640. In 1809, after Finland became a grand duchy within the Russian Empire, it was renamed the &quot;Imperial Academy of Turku&quot;. In 1828, after the Great Fire of Turku, the institution was moved to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the capital of the grand duchy. It was finally renamed the University of Helsinki when Finland declared independence in 1917.

==History==

The academy was founded on 26 March 1640 by Queen Christina of Sweden at the proposal of Count Per Brahe, on base of Åbo Cathedral School (founded 1276). It was the third university in the Swedish Empire, following Uppsala University (founded 1477) and the Academia Gustaviana (now the University of Tartu in Estonia) (1632).

The first printing shop in Finland was established at the academy in 1642. The printer was Peder Walde.
Turku (or Åbo in Swedish) was the largest city in Finland and among the three largest in Sweden, while under Swedish sovereignty. In 1809, Finland was ceded to Russia and the capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland was relocated to Helsinki in 1812, as Turku was regarded as being too remote from Saint Petersburg — and too near to Stockholm. As a result of the Great Fire of Turku of 1827, which devastated most of the city and also badly damaged the university, the government offices that had remained were finally moved to the new capital, and so also was the university. It continued in Helsinki, first as the &quot;Imperial Alexander University in Finland&quot;, and, following Finland&#x27;s independence in 1917, as the University of Helsinki.

There are two universities in Turku today: the Swedish-speaking Åbo Akademi University (founded in 1918) and the Finnish-speaking University of Turku (1920), which both sometimes may claim an academic tradition at the location since the 17th century, in spite of a break for almost a century.

<doc id="218067" wikidata="Q1152477" url="?curid=218067" title="Shellcode">
<text>In hacking, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is called &quot;shellcode&quot; because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode. Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. However, attempts at replacing the term have not gained wide acceptance. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.

When creating shellcode, it is generally desirable to make it both small and executable, which allows it to be used in as wide a variety of situations as possible. In assembly code, the same function can be performed in a multitude of ways and there is some variety in the lengths of opcodes that can be used for this purpose; good shellcode writers can put these small opcodes to use to create more compact shellcode. Some have reached the smallest possible size while maintaining stability.

== Types of shellcode ==
Shellcode can either be &quot;local&quot; or &quot;remote&quot;, depending on whether it gives an attacker control over the machine it runs on (local) or over another machine through a network (remote).

=== Local ===
&quot;Local&quot; shellcode is used by an attacker who has limited access to a machine but can exploit a vulnerability, for example a buffer overflow, in a higher-privileged process on that machine. If successfully executed, the shellcode will provide the attacker access to the machine with the same higher privileges as the targeted process.

=== Remote ===
&quot;Remote&quot; shellcode is used when an attacker wants to target a vulnerable process running on another machine on a local network, intranet, or a remote network. If successfully executed, the shellcode can provide the attacker access to the target machine across the network. Remote shellcodes normally use standard TCP/IP socket connections to allow the attacker access to the shell on the target machine. Such shellcode can be categorized based on how this connection is set up: if the shellcode establishes the connection it is called a &quot;reverse shell&quot;, or a &quot;connect-back&quot; shellcode because the shellcode &quot;connects back&quot; to the attacker&#x27;s machine. On the other hand, if the attacker establishes the connection, the shellcode is called a &quot;bindshell&quot; because the shellcode &quot;binds&quot; to a certain port on the victim&#x27;s machine. There&#x27;s a peculiar shellcode named &quot;bindshell random port&quot; that skips the binding part and listens on a random port made available by the operating system. Because of that, the &quot;bindshell random port&quot; became the smallest stable bindshell shellcode for x86_64 available to this date. A third, much less common type, is &quot;socket-reuse&quot; shellcode. This type of shellcode is sometimes used when an exploit establishes a connection to the vulnerable process that is not closed before the shellcode is run. The shellcode can then &quot;re-use&quot; this connection to communicate with the attacker. Socket re-using shellcode is more elaborate, since the shellcode needs to find out which connection to re-use and the machine may have many connections open.

A firewall can be used to detect outgoing connections made by connect-back shellcode as well as incoming connections made by bindshells. They can, therefore, offer some protection against an attacker, even if the system is vulnerable, by preventing the attacker from connecting to the shell created by the shellcode. One reason why socket re-using shellcode is sometimes used is that it does not create new connections and, therefore, is harder to detect and block.

=== Download and execute ===
&quot;Download and execute&quot; is a type of remote shellcode that &quot;downloads and executes&quot; some form of malware on the target system. This type of shellcode does not spawn a shell, but rather instructs the machine to download a certain executable file off the network, save it to disk and execute it. Nowadays, it is commonly used in drive-by download attacks, where a victim visits a malicious webpage that in turn attempts to run such a download and execute shellcode in order to install software on the victim&#x27;s machine. A variation of this type of shellcode downloads and loads a library. Advantages of this technique are that the code can be smaller, that it does not require the shellcode to spawn a new process on the target system, and that the shellcode does not need code to clean up the targeted process as this can be done by the library loaded into the process.

=== Staged ===
When the amount of data that an attacker can inject into the target process is too limited to execute useful shellcode directly, it may be possible to execute it in stages. First, a small piece of shellcode (stage 1) is executed. This code then downloads a larger piece of shellcode (stage 2) into the process&#x27;s memory and executes it.

=== Egg-hunt ===
This is another form of &quot;staged&quot; shellcode, which is used if an attacker can inject a larger shellcode into the process but cannot determine where in the process it will end up. Small &quot;egg-hunt&quot; shellcode is injected into the process at a predictable location and executed. This code then searches the process&#x27;s address space for the larger shellcode (the &quot;egg&quot;) and executes it.

=== Omelette ===
This type of shellcode is similar to &quot;egg-hunt&quot; shellcode, but looks for multiple small blocks of data (&quot;eggs&quot;) and recombines them into one larger block (the &quot;omelette&quot;) that is subsequently executed. This is used when an attacker can only inject a number of small blocks of data into the process.

==Shellcode execution strategy==
An exploit will commonly inject a shellcode into the target process before or at the same time as it exploits a vulnerability to gain control over the program counter. The program counter is adjusted to point to the shellcode, after which it gets executed and performs its task. Injecting the shellcode is often done by storing the shellcode in data sent over the network to the vulnerable process, by supplying it in a file that is read by the vulnerable process or through the command line or environment in the case of local exploits.

==Shellcode encoding==
Because most processes filter or restrict the data that can be injected, shellcode often needs to be written to allow for these restrictions. This includes making the code small, null-free or alphanumeric. Various solutions have been found to get around such restrictions, including:
* Design and implementation optimizations to decrease the size of the shellcode.
* Implementation modifications to get around limitations in the range of bytes used in the shellcode.
* Self-modifying code that modifies a number of the bytes of its own code before executing them to re-create bytes that are normally impossible to inject into the process.

Since intrusion detection can detect signatures of simple shellcodes being sent over the network, it is often encoded, made self-decrypting or polymorphic to avoid detection.

===Percent encoding===
Exploits that target browsers commonly encode shellcode in a JavaScript string using percent-encoding, escape sequence encoding &quot;&quot; or entity encoding. Some exploits also obfuscate the encoded shellcode string further to prevent detection by IDS.

For example, on the IA-32 architecture, here&#x27;s how two codice_1 (no-operation) instructions would look, first unencoded:
 90 NOP
 90 NOP

This instruction is used in NOP slides.

===Null-free shellcode===
Most shellcodes are written without the use of null bytes because they are intended to be injected into a target process through null-terminated strings. When a null-terminated string is copied, it will be copied up to and including the first null but subsequent bytes of the shellcode will not be processed. When shellcode that contains nulls is injected in this way, only part of the shellcode would be injected, making it incapable of running successfully.

To produce null-free shellcode from shellcode that contains null bytes, one can substitute machine instructions that contain zeroes with instructions that have the same effect but are free of nulls. For example, on the IA-32 architecture one could replace this instruction:
 B8 01000000 MOV EAX,1 // Set the register EAX to 0x00000001
which contains zeroes as part of the literal (codice_2 expands to codice_3) with these instructions:
 33C0 XOR EAX,EAX // Set the register EAX to 0x00000000
 40 INC EAX // Increase EAX to 0x00000001
which have the same effect but take fewer bytes to encode and are free of nulls.

===Alphanumeric and printable shellcode===
An alphanumeric shellcode is a shellcode that consists of or assembles itself on execution into entirely alphanumeric ASCII or Unicode characters such as 0–9, A–Z and a–z. This type of encoding was created by hackers to hide working machine code inside what appears to be text. This can be useful to avoid detection of the code and to allow the code to pass through filters that scrub non-alphanumeric characters from strings (in part, such filters were a response to non-alphanumeric shellcode exploits). A similar type of encoding is called &quot;printable code&quot; and uses all printable characters (0–9, A–Z, a–z, !@#%^&amp;*() etc.). A similarly restricted variant is &quot;ECHOable code&quot; not containing any characters which are not accepted by the ECHO command. It has been shown that it is possible to create shellcode that looks like normal text in English.
Writing alphanumeric or printable code requires good understanding of the instruction set architecture of the machine(s) on which the code is to be executed. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to write alphanumeric code that is executable on more than one machine, thereby constituting multi-architecture executable code.

In certain circumstances, a target process will filter any byte from the injected shellcode that is not a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions that can be used to write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.

===Unicode proof shellcode===
Modern programs use Unicode strings to allow internationalization of text. Often, these programs will convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some special characters). When an ASCII (Latin-1 in general) string is transformed into UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the original string. Obscou proved in Phrack 61 that it is possible to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.

==Platforms==
Most shellcode is written in machine code because of the low level at which the vulnerability being exploited gives an attacker access to the process. Shellcode is therefore often created to target one specific combination of processor, operating system and service pack, called a platform. For some exploits, due to the constraints put on the shellcode by the target process, a very specific shellcode must be created. However, it is not impossible for one shellcode to work for multiple exploits, service packs, operating systems and even processors. Such versatility is commonly achieved by creating multiple versions of the shellcode that target the various platforms and creating a header that branches to the correct version for the platform the code is running on. When executed, the code behaves differently for different platforms and executes the right part of the shellcode for the platform it is running on.

==Shellcode analysis==
Shellcode cannot be executed directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts to do it must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 as part of the Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation-based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the application which is part of the cross-platform libemu package. Another emulation-based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.

<text>Dactylorhiza is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family Orchidaceae. Its species are commonly called marsh orchids or spotted orchids. &quot;Dactylorhiza&quot; were previously classified under &quot;Orchis&quot;, which has two round tubers.

==Description==
They are hardy tuberous geophytes. In a thickened underground stem, they can store a large amount of water to survive arid conditions. The tuber is flattened and finger-like. The long leaves are lanceolate and, in most species, also speckled. They grow along a rather long stem which reaches a height of . Leaves higher on the stem are shorter than leaves lower on the stem. The inflorescence, compared to the length of the plant, is rather short. It consists of a compact raceme with 25-50 flowers. These develop from axillary buds. The dominant colors are white and all shades of pink to red, sprinkled with darker speckles.

==Taxonomy==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Dactylorhiza&quot; is derived from Greek words δάκτυλος &quot;daktylos&quot; &#x27;finger&#x27; and ῥίζα &quot;rhiza&quot; &#x27;root&#x27;, referring to the palmately two- to five-lobed tubers of this genus.

===Species===

Many species in this genus hybridise so readily that species boundaries themselves are vague (but see), with regular name changes and no clear answers. A few species colonise very well onto fresh industrial wastes such as pulverised fuel ash, where vast hybrid swarms can appear for a decade or more, before ecological succession replaces them.

34 species are accepted.

==Distribution and habitat==
These terrestrial orchids grow in basic soils in wet meadows, bogs, heathland and in areas sparsely populated by trees. They are distributed throughout the subarctic and temperate northern hemisphere. It is found across much of Europe, North Africa and Asia from Portugal and Iceland to Taiwan and Kamchatka, including Russia, Japan, China, Central Asia, the Middle East, Ukraine, Scandinavia, Germany, Poland, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, etc. Inclusion of the widespread frog orchid, often called &quot;Coeloglossum viride&quot;, into &quot;Dactylorhiza&quot; as per some recent classifications, expands the genus distribution to include Canada and much of the United States.

<text>Neunkirchen () is a Kreis (district) in the middle of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Sankt Wendel, Kusel, Saarpfalz, Saarbrücken, and Saarlouis.

==History==
In 1814, the district Ottweiler was created; however, its history can be traced back to 1545 when it was created as &quot;Herrschaft Ottweiler&quot;, later &quot;Amt&quot; and &quot;Oberamt Ottweiler&quot;, and during the Napoleonic times as &quot;Kanton Ottweiler&quot;. Two years after its creation, it was reorganized in 1816 by order of the Congress of Vienna. In 1866, an attempt to move the district capital to Neunkirchen failed. In 1974, the districts were reorganized, the biggest change however was the change of the capital and thus the name to Neunkirchen. Some parts of the administration remained in Ottweiler.

==Geography==
The entire district is located in the industrial area, which is centered in Saarbrücken. It is situated on either bank of the Blies, a major tributary of the Saar River.

==Coat of arms==
The top part of the coat of arms show the lion of Nassau, as the area was ruled by a branch of the house of Nassau (Nassau-Saarbrücken, later Nassau-Ottweiler). In the bottom part it shows the main symbols of the two biggest cities in the district, the rose of Ottweiler and the wheel of Neunkirchen.

==List of governors==
===Oklahoma Territory===
Oklahoma Territory was organized on May 2, 1890. It had seven governors appointed by the president of the United States.

===State of Oklahoma===
Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory were combined and admitted to the Union as the State of Oklahoma on November 16, 1907.

The Constitution of Oklahoma calls for the election of a governor every four years, to take office on the second Monday in January after the election. Originally, governors could not succeed themselves, with no limit on total terms; a 1966 constitutional amendment allowed them to succeed themselves once. An amendment in 2010 limited them to eight years in total, retroactively applying to all living former governors. Should the office become vacant because of a death, resignation or removal of the governor, the lieutenant governor immediately succeeds to the governorship. After Jack C. Walton was impeached and removed in 1923, Lieutenant Governor Martin E. Trapp served in the office for the remainder of the term. He styled himself &quot;Acting Governor,&quot; as the constitution only specified that the powers of the office devolved upon the lieutenant governor, hoping that he would not be prevented from running in the next election. However, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in 1926 that, in the case of a vacancy in the office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, and he was ineligible to run for a consecutive term. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not formally elected on the same ticket.

<doc id="218075" wikidata="Q1286267" url="?curid=218075" title="SS Edmund Fitzgerald">
<text>SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was an American Great Lakes freighter that sank in Lake Superior during a storm on November 10, 1975, with the loss of the entire crew of 29 men. When launched on June 7, 1958, she was the largest ship on North America&#x27;s Great Lakes and remains the largest to have sunk there. She was located in deep water on November 14, 1975, by a U.S. Navy aircraft detecting magnetic anomalies, and found soon afterwards to be in two large pieces.

For 17 years, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; carried taconite from mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and other Great Lakes ports. As a workhorse, she set seasonal haul records six times, often breaking her own record. Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship&#x27;s intercom while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit rivers (between Lake Huron and Lake Erie), and entertaining spectators at the Soo Locks (between Lakes Superior and Huron) with a running commentary about the ship. Her size, record-breaking performance, and &quot;DJ captain&quot; endeared &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to boat watchers.

Carrying a full cargo of taconite ore pellets with Captain Ernest M. McSorley in command, she embarked on her ill-fated voyage from Superior, Wisconsin, near Duluth, on the afternoon of November 9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near Detroit, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; joined a second taconite freighter, . By the next day, the two ships were caught in a severe storm on Lake Superior, with near-hurricane-force winds and waves up to high. Shortly after 7:10 p.m., &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; suddenly sank in Canadian (Ontario) waters deep, about from Whitefish Bay near the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario—a distance &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; could have covered in just over an hour at her top speed.

&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; previously reported being in significant difficulty to the Swedish vessel &quot;Avafors&quot;: &quot;I have a bad list, lost both radars. And am taking heavy seas over the deck. One of the worst seas I&#x27;ve ever been in.&quot; However, no distress signals were sent before she sank; Captain McSorley&#x27;s last (7:10 p.m.) message to &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; was, &quot;We are holding our own&quot;. Her crew of 29 perished, and no bodies were recovered. The exact cause of the sinking remains unknown, though many books, studies, and expeditions have examined it. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; may have been swamped, suffered structural failure or topside damage, grounded on a shoal, or suffered from a combination of these.

The disaster is one of the best known in the history of Great Lakes shipping, in part because Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot made it the subject of his 1976 popular ballad &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;. Lightfoot wrote the hit song after reading an article, &quot;The Cruelest Month&quot;, in the November 24, 1975, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;. The sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits, depth finders, positioning systems, increased freeboard, and more frequent inspection of vessels.

==History==
===Design and construction===
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, invested in the iron and minerals industries on a large scale, including the construction of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, which represented the first such investment by any American life insurance company. In 1957, they contracted Great Lakes Engineering Works (GLEW), of River Rouge, Michigan, to design and construct the ship &quot;within a foot of the maximum length allowed for passage through the soon-to-be completed Saint Lawrence Seaway.&quot; The ship&#x27;s value at that time was $7 million (equivalent to $ in ). &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was the first laker built to the maximum St. Lawrence Seaway size, which was long, wide, and with a draft. The moulded depth (roughly speaking, the vertical height of the hull) was . The hold depth (the inside height of the cargo hold) was . GLEW laid the first keel plate on August 7 the same year.

With a deadweight capacity of , and a hull, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was the longest ship on the Great Lakes, earning her the title Queen of the Lakes until September 17, 1959, when the SS &quot;Murray Bay&quot; was launched. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s three central cargo holds were loaded through 21 watertight cargo hatches, each of steel. Originally coal-fired, her boilers were converted to burn oil during the 1971–72 winter layup. In 1969, the ship&#x27;s maneuverability was improved by the installation of a diesel-powered bow thruster.

By ore freighter standards, the interior of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was luxurious. Her J.L. Hudson Company–designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting, tiled bathrooms, drapes over the portholes, and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge. There were two guest staterooms for passengers. Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters, which featured more amenities than usual. A large galley and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s pilothouse was outfitted with &quot;state-of-the-art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room.&quot;

===Name and launch===

Northwestern Mutual wanted to name the ship after its president and chairman of the board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald&#x27;s own grandfather and all great uncles had themselves been lake captains, and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company, which built and repaired ships. Fitzgerald had attempted to dissuade the naming of the ship after himself, proposing the names &quot;Centennial&quot;, &quot;Seaway&quot;, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; and &quot;Northwestern&quot;. The board was resolute, and Edmund abstained from voting; the 36 board members voted unanimously to name her the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. More than 15,000 people attended &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s christening and launch ceremony on June 7, 1958. The event was plagued by misfortunes. When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the ship by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the ship created a large wave that doused the spectators and then crashed into a pier before righting herself. Other witnesses later said they swore the ship was &quot;trying to climb right out of the water&quot;. On September 22, 1958, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; completed nine days of sea trials.

===Career===

Northwestern Mutual&#x27;s normal practice was to purchase ships for operation by other companies. In &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s case, they signed a 25-year contract with Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the vessel. Oglebay Norton immediately designated &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; the flagship of its Columbia Transportation fleet.

&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was a record-setting workhorse, often beating her own milestones. The vessel&#x27;s record load for a single trip was in 1969. For 17 years, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; carried taconite from Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo, and other ports. She set seasonal haul records six different times. Her nicknames included &quot;Fitz&quot;, &quot;Pride of the American Side&quot;, &quot;Mighty Fitz&quot;, &quot;Toledo Express&quot;, &quot;Big Fitz&quot;, and the &quot;&quot;Titanic&quot; of the Great Lakes&quot;. Loading &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; with taconite pellets took about four and a half hours, while unloading took around 14 hours. A round trip between Superior, Wisconsin, and Detroit, Michigan, usually took her five days and she averaged 47 similar trips per season. The vessel&#x27;s usual route was between Superior, Wisconsin, and Toledo, Ohio, although her port of destination could vary. By November 1975, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had logged an estimated 748 round trips on the Great Lakes and covered more than a million miles, &quot;a distance roughly equivalent to 44 trips around the world.&quot;

Up until a few weeks before her loss, passengers had traveled on board as company guests. Frederick Stonehouse wrote:

Because of her size, appearance, string of records, and &quot;DJ captain,&quot; &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; became a favorite of boat watchers throughout her career. Although Captain Peter Pulcer was in command of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; on trips when cargo records were set, &quot;he is best remembered ... for piping music day or night over the ship&#x27;s intercom system&quot; while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. While navigating the Soo Locks he would often come out of the pilothouse and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;.

In 1969, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; received a safety award for eight years of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS &quot;Hochelaga&quot; in 1970. Later that same year, she struck the wall of a lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. On January 7, 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships are built to last more than half a century, and &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; would have still had a long career ahead of her when she sank.

===Final voyage and wreck===


&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; left Superior, Wisconsin, at 2:15 p.m. on the afternoon of November 9, 1975, under the command of Captain Ernest M. McSorley. She was en route to the steel mill on Zug Island, near Detroit, Michigan, with a cargo of of taconite ore pellets and soon reached her full speed of . Around 5 p.m., &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. &quot;Bernie&quot; Cooper, , destined for Gary, Indiana, out of Two Harbors, Minnesota. The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the National Weather Service (NWS) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7 a.m. on November 10.

SS &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; loaded opposite &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; at the Burlington Northern Dock #1 and departed at 4:15 p.m., about two hours after &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake&#x27;s north shore to avoid the worst effects of the storm. The crew of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; followed the radio conversations between &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers&#x27; Association downbound route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00 p.m., issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior. &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; and &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; altered course northward, seeking shelter along the Ontario shore, where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00 a.m. on November 10. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; reported winds of and waves high. Captain Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; reported that after 1 a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship&#x27;s speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state that &quot;we&#x27;re going to try for some lee from Isle Royale. You&#x27;re walking away from us anyway … I can&#x27;t stay with you.&quot;

At 2:00 a.m. on November 10, the NWS upgraded its warnings from gale to storm, forecasting winds of . Until then, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had followed &quot;Arthur M. Anderson,&quot; which was travelling at a constant , but the faster &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; pulled ahead at about 3:00 a.m. As the storm center passed over the ships, they experienced shifting winds, with wind speeds temporarily dropping as wind direction changed from northeast to south and then northwest. After 1:50 p.m., when &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; logged winds of , wind speeds again picked up rapidly, and it began to snow at 2:45 p.m., reducing visibility; &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; lost sight of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, which was about ahead at the time.

Shortly after 3:30 p.m., Captain McSorley radioed &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; to report that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing. The vessel had also developed a list. Two of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s six bilge pumps ran continuously to discharge shipped water. McSorley said that he would slow his ship down so that &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; could close the gap between them. In a broadcast shortly afterward, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) warned all shipping that the Soo Locks had been closed and they should seek safe anchorage. Shortly after 4:10 p.m., McSorley called &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; again to report a radar failure and asked &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; to keep track of them. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, effectively blind, slowed to let &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; come within a range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.

For a time, &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; directed &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; toward the relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then, at 4:39 p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to report the state of the navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of &quot;Avafors&quot; between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, &quot;Don&#x27;t allow nobody on deck,&quot; as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, &quot;I have a &#x27;bad list&#x27;, I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in.&quot;

By late in the afternoon of November 10, sustained winds of over were recorded by ships and observation points across eastern Lake Superior. &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; logged sustained winds as high as at 4:52 p.m., while waves increased to as high as by 6:00 p.m. &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; was also struck by gusts and rogue waves as high as .

At approximately 7:10 p.m., when &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; notified &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; of an upbound ship and asked how she was doing, McSorley reported, &quot;We are holding our own.&quot; She was never heard from again. No distress signal was received, and ten minutes later, &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; lost the ability either to reach &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; by radio or to detect her on radar.

===Search===

Captain Cooper of &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; first called the USCG in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39 p.m. on channel 16, the radio distress frequency. The USCG responders instructed him to call back on channel 12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm. Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel &quot;Nanfri&quot; and was told that she could not pick up &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; on her radar either. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54 p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a boat lost in the area. At about 8:25 p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and at 9:03 p.m. reported her missing. Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, &quot;I considered it serious, but at the time it was not urgent.&quot;

Lacking appropriate search-and-rescue vessels to respond to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s disaster, at approximately 9:00 p.m., the USCG asked &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; to turn around and look for survivors. Around 10:30 p.m., the USCG asked all commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search. The initial search for survivors was carried out by &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot;, and a second freighter, . The efforts of a third freighter, the Toronto-registered , were foiled by the weather. The USCG sent a buoy tender, , from Duluth, Minnesota, but it took two and a half hours to launch and a day to travel to the search area. The Traverse City, Michigan, USCG station launched an HU-16 fixed-wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10:53 p.m. while an HH-52 USCG helicopter with a 3.8-million-candlepower searchlight arrived at 1:00 a.m. on November 11. Canadian Coast Guard aircraft joined the three-day search and the Ontario Provincial Police established and maintained a beach patrol all along the eastern shore of Lake Superior.

Although the search recovered debris, including lifeboats and rafts, none of the crew were found. On her final voyage, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s crew of 29 consisted of the captain; the first, second, and third mates; five engineers; three oilers; a cook; a wiper; two maintenance men; three watchmen; three deckhands; three wheelsmen; two porters; a cadet; and a steward. Most of the crew were from Ohio and Wisconsin; their ages ranged from 20 (watchman Karl A. Peckol) to 63 (Captain McSorley).

&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; is among the largest and best-known vessels lost on the Great Lakes, but she is not alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area. In the years between 1816, when &quot;Invincible&quot; was lost, and 1975, when &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank, the Whitefish Point area had claimed at least 240 ships.

==Wreck discovery and surveys==
===Wreck discovery===
A U.S. Navy Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, piloted by Lt. George Conner and equipped to detect magnetic anomalies usually associated with submarines, found the wreck on November 14, 1975 in Canadian waters close to the international boundary at a depth of . &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; lies about west of Deadman&#x27;s Cove, Ontario; about northwest of Pancake Bay Provincial Park; and from the entrance to Whitefish Bay to the southeast. A further November 14–16 survey by the USCG using a side scan sonar revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor. The U.S. Navy also contracted Seaward, Inc., to conduct a second survey between November 22 and 25.

===Underwater surveys===
From May 20 to 28, 1976, the U.S. Navy dived on the wreck using its unmanned submersible, CURV-III, and found &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; lying in two large pieces in of water. Navy estimates put the length of the bow section at and that of the stern section at . The bow section stood upright in the mud, some from the stern section that lay capsized at a 50-degree angle from the bow. In between the two broken sections lay a large mass of taconite pellets and scattered wreckage lying about, including hatch covers and hull plating.

In 1980, during a Lake Superior research dive expedition, marine explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of Jacques Cousteau, sent two divers from in the first manned submersible dive to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. The dive was brief, and although the dive team drew no final conclusions, they speculated that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had broken up on the surface.

The Michigan Sea Grant Program organized a three-day dive to survey &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and the production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free-swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide-angle lenses in order to produce 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV &quot;Grayling&quot; as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sinking.

Canadian explorer Joseph B. MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; over a three-day period in 1994. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided &quot;Edwin A. Link&quot; as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, &quot;Celia.&quot; The GLSHS paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank. The same year, longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd., and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, using Delta Oceanographic&#x27;s submersible, &quot;Delta.&quot; Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; at 211 minutes. Prior to conducting the dives, Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976. Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition, &quot;at least one-third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S.–Canada boundary line shown on official lake charts.&quot;

Shannon&#x27;s group discovered the remains of a crew member partly dressed in coveralls and wearing a life jacket alongside the bow of the ship, indicating that at least one of the crew was aware of the possibility of sinking. The life jacket had deteriorated canvas and &quot;what is thought to be six rectangular cork blocks ... clearly visible.&quot; Shannon concluded that &quot;massive and advancing structural failure&quot; caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to break apart on the surface and sink.

MacInnis led another series of dives in 1995 to salvage the bell from &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. The Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians backed the expedition by co-signing a loan in the amount of $250,000. Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten&#x27;s atmospheric diving suit, known as the Newtsuit, was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, replace it with a replica, and put a beer can in &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s pilothouse. That same year, Terrence Tysall and Mike Zee set multiple records when they used trimix gas to scuba dive to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. The pair are the only people known to have touched the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; wreck. They also set records for the deepest scuba dive on the Great Lakes and the deepest shipwreck dive, and were the first divers to reach &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; without the aid of a submersible. It took six minutes to reach the wreck, six minutes to survey it, and three hours to resurface to avoid decompression sickness, also known as &quot;the bends&quot;.

===Restrictions on surveys===
Under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;, activities on registered archeological sites require a license. In March 2005, the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an unauthorized dive to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. Although the director of the GLSHS admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, he denied such a survey required a license at the time it was carried out.

An April 2005 amendment to the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; allows the Ontario government to impose a license requirement on dives, the operation of submersibles, side scan sonars, or underwater cameras within a designated radius around protected sites. Conducting any of those activities without a license would result in fines of up to . On the basis of the amended law, to protect wreck sites considered &quot;watery graves&quot;, the Ontario government issued updated regulations in January 2006, including an area with a radius around &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and other specifically designated marine archeological sites. In 2009, a further amendment to the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; imposed licensing requirements on any type of surveying device.

==Hypotheses on the cause of sinking==
Extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published hypotheses regarding &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sinking, but they differ on the other causal factors.

===Waves and weather hypothesis===

In 2005, NOAA and the NWS ran a computer simulation, including weather and wave conditions, covering the period from November 9, 1975, until the early morning of November 11. Analysis of the simulation showed that two separate areas of high-speed wind appeared over Lake Superior at 4:00 p.m. on November 10. One had speeds in excess of and the other winds in excess of . The southeastern part of the lake, the direction in which &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was heading, had the highest winds. Average wave heights increased to near by 7:00 p.m., November 10, and winds exceeded over most of southeastern Lake Superior.

&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind where the long fetch, or distance that wind blows over water, produced significant waves averaging over by 7:00 p.m. and over at 8:00 p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100 waves reaching and one out of every 1,000 reaching . Since the ship was heading east-southeastward, it is likely that the waves caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to roll heavily.

At the time of the sinking, the ship &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; reported northwest winds of , matching the simulation analysis result of . The analysis further showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near hurricane force of about with gusts to at the time and location where &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank.

===Rogue wave hypothesis===
A group of three rogue waves, often called &quot;three sisters,&quot; was reported in the vicinity of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; at the time she sank. The &quot;three sisters&quot; phenomenon is said to occur on Lake Superior and refers to a sequence of three rogue waves forming that are one-third larger than normal waves. The first wave introduces an abnormally large amount of water onto the deck. This water is unable to fully drain away before the second wave strikes, adding to the surplus. The third incoming wave again adds to the two accumulated backwashes, quickly overloading the deck with too much water.

Captain Cooper of &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; reported that his ship was &quot;hit by two 30 to 35 foot seas about 6:30 p.m., one burying the aft cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle. The second wave of this size, perhaps 35 foot, came over the bridge deck.&quot; Cooper went on to say that these two waves, possibly followed by a third, continued in the direction of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and would have struck about the time she sank. This hypothesis postulates that the &quot;three sisters&quot; compounded the twin problems of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s known list and her lower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual.

The &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; episode of the 2010 television series &quot;Dive Detectives&quot; features the wave-generating tank of the National Research Council&#x27;s Institute for Naval Technology in St. John&#x27;s, and the tank&#x27;s simulation of the effect of a rogue wave upon a scale model of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. The simulation indicated such a rogue wave could almost completely submerge the bow or stern of the ship with water, at least temporarily.

===Cargo-hold flooding hypothesis===
The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report suggested that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to flood and founder.

From the beginning of the USCG inquiry, some of the crewmen&#x27;s families and various labor organizations believed the USCG findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness as well as licensing and rules changes. Paul Trimble, a retired USCG vice admiral and president of the Lake Carriers Association (LCA), wrote a letter to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on September 16, 1977, that included the following statements of objection to the USCG findings:
It was common practice for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked in place on the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that, depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.

The May 4, 1978, NTSB findings differed from the USCG. The NTSB made the following observations based on the CURV-III survey:

The NTSB conducted computer studies, testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers and concluded that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank suddenly from flooding of the cargo hold &quot;due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas&quot; instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures. The NTSB dissenting opinion held that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank suddenly and unexpectedly from shoaling.

===Shoaling hypothesis===
The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s loss was shoaling or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of Caribou Island when the vessel &quot;unknowingly raked a reef&quot; during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids. This hypothesis was supported by a 1976 Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile farther east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; observed that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sailed through this exact area. Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal hypothesis concluded that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship &quot;hogged&quot; during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain. Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of &quot;a recent collision or grounding anywhere.&quot; Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling hypothesis was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon&#x27;s 1994 photography that &quot;explicitly show[s] the devastation of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;. Shannon&#x27;s photography of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s overturned stern showed &quot;no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal.&quot;

Maritime author Stonehouse reasoned that &quot;unlike the Lake Carriers, the Coast Guard had no vested interest in the outcome of their investigation.&quot; Author Bishop reported that Captain Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; argued that through their support for the shoaling explanation, the LCA represented the shipping company&#x27;s interests by advocating a hypothesis that held LCA member companies, the American Bureau of Shipping, and the U.S. Coast Guard Service blameless.

Paul Hainault, a retired professor of mechanical engineering from Michigan Technological University, promoted a hypothesis that began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; grounded at 9:30 a.m. on November 10 on Superior Shoal. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about north of Copper Harbor, Michigan. It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from , making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes. A seiche, or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, caused the lake to rise over the Soo Locks&#x27;s gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with of water. Hainault&#x27;s hypothesis held that this seiche contributed to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; shoaling of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18 degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.

===Structural failure hypothesis===
Another published hypothesis contends that an already weakened structure, and modification of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s winter load line (which allows heavier loading and travel lower in the water), made it possible for large waves to cause a stress fracture in the hull. This is based on the &quot;regular&quot; huge waves of the storm and does not necessarily involve rogue waves.

The USCG and NTSB investigated whether &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; broke apart due to structural failure of the hull and because the 1976 CURV III survey found &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sections were from each other, the USCG&#x27;s formal casualty report of July 1977 concluded that she had separated upon hitting the lake floor. The NTSB came to the same conclusion as USCG because:

Other authors have concluded that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; most likely broke in two on the surface before sinking due to the intense waves, like the ore carriers and . After maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse moderated the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989 ROV survey of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage over the wreck site showed that the stern had floated on the surface for a short time and spilled taconite into the forward section; thus the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time. The 1994 Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were apart, leading Shannon to conclude that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; broke up on the surface. He said:

The stress fracture hypothesis was supported by the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; in 1972 and 1973, testified that &quot;the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms &#x27;like a diving board after somebody has jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was caused by hull failure, &quot;pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress.&quot; George H. &quot;Red&quot; Burgner, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a &quot;loose keel&quot; contributed to the vessel&#x27;s loss. Burgner further testified that &quot;the keel and sister kelsons were only &#x27;tack welded&#x27;&quot; and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.

When Bethlehem Steel Corporation permanently laid up &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sister ship, SS &quot;Arthur B. Homer&quot;, just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems. The two vessels were built in the same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break. Reports indicate that repairs to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. &quot;Arthur B. Homer&quot; was lengthened to and placed back in service by December 1975, not long after &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on &quot;Arthur B. Homer&quot;. &quot;Arthur B. Homer&quot; was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.

Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsay, one of the members of the design team that worked on the hull of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, reviewed her increased load lines, maintenance history, along with the history of long ship hull failure and concluded that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was not seaworthy on November 10, 1975. He stated that planning &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to be compatible with the constraints of the St. Lawrence Seaway had placed her hull design in a &quot;.&quot; &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s long-ship design was developed without the benefit of research, development, test, and evaluation principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built. Ramsay noted that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method, which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard. Ramsay concluded that increasing the hull length to resulted in an L/D slenderness ratio (the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure) that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull, and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length.

===Topside damage hypothesis===
The USCG cited topside damage as a reasonable alternative reason for &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sinking and surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s deck. He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; experienced at 3:30 p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.

==Possible contributing factors==
The USCG, NTSB, and proponents of alternative theories have all named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;.

===Weather forecasting===

The NWS long-range forecast on November 9, 1975, predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over the Keweenaw Peninsula, extending into the Lake from Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. Captain Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; had been following and charting the low-pressure system over Oklahoma since November 8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior. He therefore chose a route that gave &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; the most protection and took refuge in Thunder Bay, Ontario, during the worst of the storm. Based on the NWS forecast, &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; and &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route, which placed them in the path of the storm. The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November 10. After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November 10, 1975, Hultquist of the NWS said of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s position in the storm, &quot;It ended in precisely the wrong place at the absolute worst time.&quot;

===Inaccurate navigational charts===
After reviewing testimony that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts. They found that the Canadian 1973 navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973 U.S. Lake Survey Chart No. 9 included the notation, &quot;Canadian Areas. For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted.&quot; Thereafter, at the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District, the Canadian Hydrographic Service conducted a survey of the area surrounding Michipicoten Island and Caribou Island in 1976. The survey revealed that the shoal ran about farther east than shown on Canadian charts. The NTSB investigation concluded that, at the time of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s foundering, Lake Survey Chart No. 9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation.

===Lack of watertight bulkheads===
Mark Thompson, a merchant seaman and author of numerous books on Great Lakes shipping, stated that if her cargo holds had had watertight subdivisions, &quot;the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; could have made it into Whitefish Bay.&quot; Frederick Stonehouse also held that the lack of watertight bulkheads caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to sink. He said:

Stonehouse called on ship designers and builders to design lake carriers more like ships rather than &quot;motorized super-barges&quot; making the following comparison:

After &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; foundered, Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo payloads more than human life, since the vessel&#x27;s cargo hold of had been divided by two non-watertight traverse &quot;screen&quot; bulkheads. The NTSB &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in their cargo holds.

The USCG had proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as early as the sinking of &quot;Daniel J. Morrell&quot; in 1966 and did so again after the sinking of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion. The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators. A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975, but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area.

===Lack of instrumentation===
A fathometer was not required under USCG regulations, and &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; lacked one, even though fathometers were available at the time of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; additional navigational data and made her less dependent on &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; for navigational assistance.

&quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in her cargo hold, even though there was always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck (deck over the cargo holds). The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship&#x27;s deck above the water).

===Increased load lines, reduced freeboard===
The USCG increased &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s load line in 1969, 1971, and 1973 to allow less minimum freeboard than &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s original design allowed in 1958. This meant that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s deck was only above the water when she faced waves during the November 10 storm. Captain Paquette of &quot;Wilfred Sykes&quot; noted that this change allowed loading to 4,000 tons more than what &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was designed to carry.

Concerns regarding &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s keel-welding problem surfaced during the time the USCG started increasing her load line. This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel&#x27;s critical reserve buoyancy. Prior to the load-line increases she was said to be a &quot;good riding ship&quot; but afterwards &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; became a sluggish ship with slower response and recovery times. Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a &quot;wiggling thing&quot; that scared him. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.

===Maintenance===
NTSB investigators noted that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s prior groundings could have caused undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally drydocked for inspection only once every five years. It was also alleged that when compared to &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s previous captain (Peter Pulcer), McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done. After August B. Herbel Jr., president of the American Society for Testing and Materials, examined photographs of the welds on &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, he stated, &quot;the hull was just being held together with patching plates.&quot; Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.

===Complacency===
On the fateful evening of November 10, 1975, McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life. Paquette, master of &quot;Wilfred Sykes,&quot; out in the same storm, said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell anyone that it was a &quot;monster&quot; sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there.&quot; The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3:35 p.m. on November 10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.

McSorley was known as a &quot;heavy weather captain&quot; who beat hell&#x27; out of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and &#x27;very seldom ever hauled up for weather. Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; to founder. He said, &quot;in my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because (McSorley) kept pushing that ship and didn&#x27;t have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas.&quot; Paquette&#x27;s vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November 10 storm; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard &quot;Sykes.&quot; He told them that &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s foundering was caused by negligence. Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations.

The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms and called for the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.

The USCG Marine Board issued the following conclusion:

Mark Thompson countered that &quot;the Coast Guard laid bare [its] own complacency&quot; by blaming the sinking of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; on industry-wide complacency since it had inspected &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; just two weeks before she sank. The loss of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; also exposed the USCG&#x27;s lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior. Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG&#x27;s ability to perform its historical functions. He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach the scene of an incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6 to 12 hours of its occurrence.

==Legal settlement==
Under maritime law, ships fall under the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts of their flag country. As &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was sailing under the U.S. flag, even though she sank in foreign (Canadian) waters, she was subject to U.S. admiralty law. With a value of $24 million, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history. In addition to the crew, of taconite sank along with the vessel. Two widows of crewmen filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s owners, Northwestern Mutual, and its operators, Oglebay Norton Corporation, one week after she sank. An additional $2.1 million lawsuit was later filed. Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to &quot;limit their liability to $817,920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members&quot;. The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12 months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements. Robert Hemming, a reporter and newspaper editor, reasoned in his book about &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; that the USCG&#x27;s conclusions &quot;were benign in placing blame on [n]either the company or the captain ... [and] saved the Oglebay Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew.&quot;

==Subsequent changes to Great Lakes shipping practice==
The USCG investigation of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sinking resulted in 15 recommendations regarding load lines, weathertight integrity, search and rescue capability, lifesaving equipment, crew training, loading manuals, and providing information to masters of Great Lakes vessels. NTSB&#x27;s investigation resulted in 19 recommendations for the USCG, four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping, and two recommendations for NOAA. Of the official recommendations, the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place:
:1. In 1977, the USCG made it a requirement that all vessels of 1,600 gross register tons and over use depth finders.
:2. Since 1980, survival suits have been required aboard ship in each crew member&#x27;s quarters and at their customary work station with strobe lights affixed to life jackets and survival suits.
:3. A LORAN-C positioning system for navigation on the Great Lakes was implemented in 1980 and later replaced with Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1990s.
:4. Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) are installed on all Great Lakes vessels for immediate and accurate location in event of a disaster.
:5. Navigational charts for northeastern Lake Superior were improved for accuracy and greater detail.
:6. NOAA revised its method for predicting wave heights.
:7. The USCG rescinded the 1973 Load Line Regulation amendment that permitted reduced freeboard loadings.
:8. The USCG began the annual pre-November inspection program recommended by the NTSB. &quot;Coast Guard inspectors now board all U.S. ships during the fall to inspect hatch and vent closures and lifesaving equipment.&quot;

Karl Bohnak, an Upper Peninsula meteorologist, covered the sinking and storm in a book on local weather history. In this book, Joe Warren, a deckhand on &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot; during the November 10, 1975, storm, said that the storm changed the way things were done. He stated, &quot;After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [anchor]. We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink.&quot; Mark Thompson wrote, &quot;Since the loss of the &quot;Fitz,&quot; some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as &#x27;heavy weather sailors.&#x27;&quot;

==Memorials==

The day after the wreck, Mariners&#x27; Church in Detroit rang its bell 29 times, once for each life lost. The church continued to hold an annual memorial, reading the names of the crewmen and ringing the church bell, until 2006 when the church broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes. After the death of singer Gordon Lightfoot on May 1, 2023, the church bell was ceremonially rung 29 times in memory of the crew, plus an additional ring in memory of Lightfoot who committed their deaths to posterity.

The ship&#x27;s bell was recovered from the wreck on July 4, 1995. A replica engraved with the names of the 29 sailors who died replaced the original on the wreck. A legal document signed by 46 relatives of the deceased, officials of the Mariners&#x27; Church of Detroit and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historic Society (GLSHS) &quot;donated the custodian and conservatorship&quot; of the bell to the GLSHS &quot;to be incorporated in a permanent memorial at Whitefish Point, Michigan, to honor the memory of the 29 men of the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;&quot; The terms of the legal agreement made the GLSHS responsible for maintaining the bell, and forbade it from selling or moving the bell or using it for commercial purposes. It provided for transferring the bell to the Mariners&#x27; Church of Detroit if the terms were violated.

An uproar occurred in 1995 when a maintenance worker in St. Ignace, Michigan, refurbished the bell by stripping the protective coating applied by Michigan State University experts. The controversy continued when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum tried to use the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996. Relatives of the crew halted this move, objecting that the bell was being used as a &quot;traveling trophy.&quot; , the bell is on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point near Paradise, Michigan.

An anchor from &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; lost on an earlier trip from 1974 was recovered from the Detroit River on July 20, 1992 and is on display at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit, Michigan. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10. Artifacts on display in the Steamship Valley Camp museum in Sault Ste. Marie, include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and commemorative models and paintings. Every November 10, the Split Rock Lighthouse near Silver Bay, Minnesota, emits a light in honor of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;

On August 8, 2007, along a remote shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family discovered a lone life-saving ring that appeared to have come from &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. It bore markings different from those of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.

The Royal Canadian Mint commemorated &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; in 2015 with a colored silver collector coin, with a face value of $20.

===Musical and theater tributes===
Ontario singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote, composed, and recorded the song &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot; for his 1976 album &quot;Summertime Dream.&quot; On NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; on February 14, 2015, Gordon Lightfoot said he was inspired to write the song when he saw the name misspelled &quot;Edmond&quot; in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine two weeks after the sinking; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died. Lightfoot&#x27;s popular ballad made the sinking of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; one of the best-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking: it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit. Also, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot modified one line for live performances, the original stanza being:

Lightfoot changed the third line to &quot;At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then&quot;, although possibly to &quot;At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was dim&quot;.

He also changed the word &quot;musty&quot; in the lines

to &quot;rustic&quot;, as the building is not actually musty (it is also not a cathedral as it is not the seat of a bishop, and its name is actually Mariners&#x27; Church, but this line was never changed).

On May 2, 2023, at 3 p.m. the Mariners&#x27; Church of Detroit tolled its bell 30 times; 29 times in memory of the crew of the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot;, and a 30th time in memory of Lightfoot, who died at age 84, on May 1, 2023.

In 1986, writer Steven Dietz and songwriter/lyricist Eric Peltoniemi wrote the musical &quot;Ten November&quot; in memory of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s sinking. In 2005, the play was re-edited into a concert version called &quot;The Gales of November&quot;, which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota.

In November 2000, Shelley Russell opened a production of her play, &quot;Holdin&#x27; Our Own: The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, at the Forest Roberts Theatre on the campus of Northern Michigan University. The production featured a cast of 14, 11 set on board the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; and three on the &quot;Arthur M. Anderson&quot;.

A piano concerto titled &quot;The&quot; &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was composed by American composer Geoffrey Peterson in 2002; it was premiered by the Sault Symphony Orchestra in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in November 2005 as another 30th-anniversary commemoration.

===Commercialization===
The fame of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;″s image and historical narrative have made it public domain and subject to commercialization. A &quot;cottage industry&quot; has evolved across the Great Lakes region from Two Harbors, Minnesota, to Whitefish Point, the incident&#x27;s &quot;ground zero&quot;. Memorabilia on sale include Christmas ornaments, T-shirts, coffee mugs, &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; Porter, videos, and other items commemorating the vessel and its loss.

<text>The Keweenaw Peninsula (, ) is a peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. Part of the greater landmass of the Upper Peninsula, the Keweenaw Peninsula projects about northeasterly into Lake Superior, forming Keweenaw Bay. The peninsula is part of Michigan&#x27;s Copper Country region, as the region was home to the first major copper mining boom in the United States. Copper mining was active in this region from the 1840s to the 1960s.

The peninsula is bisected by the Keweenaw Waterway, a partly natural, partly artificial waterway serving as a canal. The north side of the canal is known locally as Copper Island. The cities of Houghton, the peninsula&#x27;s largest population center, and Hancock, are located along the shores of the Keweenaw Waterway. Houghton is home to Michigan Technological University.

The Keweenaw Peninsula is politically divided primarily between Houghton and Keweenaw counties, both of which occupy the Houghton micropolitan area. A small portion of the southeast of the peninsula is part of Baraga County.

==Geology==

The peninsula measures about in length and about in width at its base.

The ancient lava flows of the Keweenaw Peninsula were produced during the Mesoproterozoic Era as a part of the Midcontinent Rift between 1.096 and 1.087 billion years ago. This volcanic activity produced the only strata on Earth where large-scale economically recoverable 97 percent pure native copper is found.

Much of the native copper found in the Keweenaw comes in either the form of cavity fillings on lava flow surfaces, which has a ”lacy” consistency, or as &quot;float&quot; copper, which is found as a solid mass. Copper ore may occur within conglomerate or breccia as void or interclast fillings. The conglomerate layers occur as interbedded units within the volcanic pile.

The Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale, formed by the Midcontinent Rift System, are the only sites in the United States with evidence of prehistoric aboriginal mining of copper. Artifacts made from this copper by these ancient indigenous people were traded as far south as present-day Alabama. These areas are also the unique location where chlorastrolite, the state gem of Michigan, can be found.

The northern end of the peninsula is sometimes referred to as Copper Island (or &quot;Kuparisaari&quot; by Finnish immigrants), although this term is becoming less common. It is separated from the rest of the peninsula by the Keweenaw Waterway, a natural waterway which was dredged and expanded in the 1860s across the peninsula between the cities of Houghton (named for Douglass Houghton) on the south side and Hancock on the north.

A Keweenaw Water Trail has been established around Copper Island. The Water Trail stretches approximately and can be paddled in five to ten days, depending on weather and water conditions.

The Keweenaw Fault runs fairly lengthwise through both Keweenaw and neighboring Houghton counties. This ancient geological slip has given rise to cliffs. U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) and Brockway Mountain Drive, north of Calumet, were constructed along the cliff line.
==Climate==
Lake Superior significantly controls the climate of the Keweenaw Peninsula, keeping winters milder than those in surrounding areas. Spring is cool and brief, transitioning into a summer with highs near . Fall begins in September, with winter beginning in mid-November.

The peninsula receives copious amounts of lake-effect snow from Lake Superior. Official records are maintained close to the base of the peninsula in Hancock, Michigan, where the annual snowfall average is about . Keweenaw County reports daily snowfall, and monthly and seasonal totals since 2006. In the Keweenaw community of Delaware, an unofficial record gives an average of about (1957-2011) and the record snowfall for one season of in 1979. Averages over certainly occur in the higher elevations closer to the tip of the peninsula.
==History==

Beginning as early as seven thousand years ago and apparently peaking around 3000 B.C., Native Americans dug copper from the southern shore of Lake Superior. This development was possible in large part because, in this region, large deposits of copper were easily accessible in surface rock and from shallow diggings. Native copper could be found as large nuggets and wiry masses. Copper as a resource for functional tooling achieved popularity around 3000 B.C., during the Middle Archaic Stage. The focus of copper working seems to have gradually shifted from functional tools to ornamental objects by the Late Archaic Stage c. 1200 B.C. Native Americans would build a fire to heat the rock around and over a copper mass and, after heating, pour on cold water to crack the rock. The copper was then pounded out, using rock hammers and stone chisels.

The Keweenaw&#x27;s rich deposits of copper (and some silver) were extracted on an industrial scale beginning around the middle of the 19th century. The industry grew through the latter part of the century and employed thousands of people well into the 20th century. Hard rock mining in the region ceased in 1967 though copper sulfide deposits continued for some time after in Ontonagon. This vigorous industry created a need for educated mining professionals and directly led in 1885 to the founding of the Michigan Mining School (now Michigan Technological University) in Houghton. Although MTU discontinued its undergraduate mining engineering program in 2006, the university continues to offer engineering degrees in a variety of other disciplines. (In 2012 mining engineering was restarted in the re-formed Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences.)

Running concurrently with the mining boom in the Keweenaw was the white pine lumber boom. Trees were cut for timbers for mine shafts, to heat the communities around the large copper mines, and to help build a growing nation. Much of the logging at the time was done in winter due to the ease of operability with the snow. Due to the logging practices at that time, the forest of the Keweenaw looks much different today from 100 years ago.

US 41 terminates in the northern Keweenaw at the Michigan State Park housing Fort Wilkins. US 41 was the so-called &quot;Military Trail&quot; that started in Chicago in the 1900s and ended in the Keweenaw wilderness. The restored fort has numerous exhibits.

For detailed information on the region&#x27;s mineralogical history, see the virtual tour of the peninsula written by the Mineralogical Society of America, found in &quot;External links&quot; on this page. Information on the geological formations of the region are also detailed.

From 1964 to 1971, the University of Michigan and Michigan Technological University cooperated with NASA and the U.S. Navy to run the Keweenaw Rocket launch site.

<doc id="218079" wikidata="Q840530" url="?curid=218079" title="Dai people">
<text>The Dai people (Burmese: ရှမ်းလူမျိုး; ; ; ; , ; , ; ) are several Tai-speaking ethnic groups living in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of China&#x27;s Yunnan Province. The Dai people form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. By extension, the term can apply to groups in Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar when Dai is used to mean specifically [[Shan people|Tai Yai]], [[Tai Lue people|Lue]], [[Tai Nua people|Chinese Shan]], [[Tai Dam people|Tai Dam]], Tai Khao or even [[Tai peoples|Tai]] in general. For other names, see the table below.

==Name ambiguity ==

The Dai people are closely related to the Shan, Lao and Thai people who form a majority in Laos and Thailand, and a large minority in Myanmar. Originally, the Tai, or Dai, lived closely together in modern Yunnan Province until political chaos and wars in the north at the end of the Tang and Song dynasty and various nomadic peoples prompted some to move further south into modern Laos then Thailand. As with many other officially recognized ethnic groups in China (See Gaoshan and Yao), the term &quot;Dai&quot;, at least within Chinese usage, is an umbrella term and as such has no equivalent in Tai languages, who have only more general terms for &#x27;Tai peoples in general&#x27; (e.g., Tai Lue: . This term refers to all Dai people, not including Zhuang) and &#x27;Tai people in China&#x27; (e.g., &#x27;), both of which include the Zhuang, for example, which is not the case in the Chinese and more specific terms, as shown in the table below. Therefore the word &quot;Dai&quot;, like with the aforementioned &quot;Yao&quot;, is a Han Chinese cultural concept which has now been adopted by other languages such as English, French, and German (see respective Wikipedias). As a solution in the Thai language, however, as in English, the term Tai Lue can be used to mean Dai, despite referring to other groups as in the table below. This is because the two main groups actually bear the same name, both meaning &#x27;Northern Tai&#x27; (&quot;lue&quot; and &quot;nüa&quot; are cognate).

Although they are officially recognized as a single people by the Chinese state, these Tai people form several distinct cultural and linguistic groups. The two main languages of the Dai are Dai Lü (Sibsongbanna Dai) and Dai Nüa (Daihong Dai); two other written languages used by the Dai are Tày Pong and Tai Dam. They all are Tai languages, a group of related languages that includes Thai, Lao and Zhuang and part of the Tai–Kadai language family. Various languages of the Tai-Kadai language family are spoken from Assam in India to Hainan and Guizhou in China. The Dai people follow their traditional religion as well as Theravada Buddhism and maintain similar customs and festivals (such as Songkran) to the other Tai-speaking peoples and more broadly, in regards to some cultural aspects, to the unrelated dominant ethnic groups of Myanmar, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. They are among the few native groups in China who nominally practice the Theravada school of Buddhism. The term Tai in China is also used sometimes to show that the majority of people subsumed under the &quot;Dai&quot; nationality are mainly speakers of Thai languages (i.e. Southwestern Tai languages). Some use the term Daizurian to refer specifically to the sinicized Tai people living in Yunnan. The term is derived from the Chinese term 傣族人; pinyin: &quot;Dǎizúrén&quot; which is translated in Shan as တႆးၸူး &quot;taj4 tsuu4&quot; meaning &quot;&quot;the Tai who are in association/united&quot;.&quot;

==Tai subgroups==
==Languages==
Peoples classified as Dai in China speak the following Southwestern Tai languages.

*Tai Lü language ()
*Tai Nüa language (; Shan language)
*Tai Dam language ()
*Tai Ya language () or Tai Hongjin ()

Yunnan (1998:150) lists 4 major Tai language varieties.
*Tai Lü language (): 400,000 speakers in Sipsongpanna, Menglian County, Jinggu County, Jiangcheng County, etc.
*Tai Nüa language (): 400,000 speakers in Dehong, Gengma, Shuangjiang, Tengchong, Baoshan, Longling, Changning, Cangyuan, Lancang, Zhenkang, Jingdong, etc.
*Tai Rui (): 40,000 speakers in Jinping, Maguan, Malipo counties, etc.
*Tianxin (): 20,000 speakers in Wuding, Luquan, Yongren, Dayao counties, etc. &quot;Representative dialect&quot;: Tianxin (), Wuding County

== History ==

=== Early period ===
In 109 BCE, the Han dynasty established the Yizhou prefecture in the southwest of Yi (modern day parts of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou). In the twelfth century, the Dai (called Dai-Lue or Tai-Lue at this period) established the Jinghong Golden Hall Kingdom in Sipsong Panna (modern Xishuangbanna). Jinghong was the capital of this kingdom. The population of the kingdom was over one million and recognized the Chinese as their sovereign according to local records. The king had political and economic power and controlled most of the land and local water system.

=== Yuan and Ming period ===
During the Yuan dynasty, the Dai became subordinate to Yunnan (itself recently conquered by the Mongols). Hereditary leaders were appointed by the authorities among the minorities of the region. This system continued under the Ming dynasty and the feudal systems during this period allowed manorial lords to establish political power along with its own army, prisons, and courts. However, some Dai communities had their own aspects of class, political structures, and land ownership that differed considerably from other groups. Also during the Ming dynasty, eight Dai &quot;tusi&quot; (chieftains) controlled the region with each having their own economic and political power. Although Buddhism has had a presence in Yunnan since at least the seventh century, the Dai converted to Theravada Buddhism during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

=== Qing and modern China ===
The Qing dynasty kept the Yuan and Ming system intact but with some differences. The Qing had more economic power in the region and routinely sent officials to the area for direct supervision and control. This well-established system was only fully replaced by the Chinese government in 1953. 1953 also marked the end of the ancient ruling family that was in place since the Jinghong Kingdom. The last king, Chao Hmoam Gham Le (Dao Shixun in Chinese) became the deputy head of Xishuangbanna prefecture.

==Exodus==
The original areas of the Tai Lue included both sides of the Mekong River in the Sipsongpanna. According to the Tai Lue, there were five city-states on the east bank and six on the west, which with Jinghong formed twelve rice field divisions with all twelve having another 32 small provinces. These were:

On the west bank - Rung, Ha, Sae, Lu, Ong, Luang, Hun, Phan, Chiang Choeng, Hai, Chiang Lo and Mang;
On the east bank - La, Bang, Hing, Pang, La, Wang, Phong, Yuan, Bang and Chiang Thong (present-day Luang Prabang). (These names are transcribed according to their Thai pronunciations not their Tai Lue (Dai) pronunciations. If transcribed according to their Tai Lue pronunciations they would be as follows: Hung, Ha, Sae, Lu, Ong, Long, Hun, Pan, Cheng Choeng, Hai, Cheng Lo, Mang, La, Bang, Hing, Pang, La, Wang, Pong, Yon, Bang and Cheng Tong)

Some portions of these Tai Lue either voluntarily moved or were forcibly herded from these city-states around one to two hundred years ago, arriving in countries of present-day Burma, Laos and Thailand.

== Cuisine ==
The staple food of the Dai people is rice. Dai people in the Dehong area mainly eat japonica rice.

Bamboo rice is a famous snack of the Dai people. It is made by putting glutinous rice in a fragrant bamboo tube, soaking with water for 15 minutes, and baking with fire.Pineapple purple rice is also a well-known Dai dish.

Raw, fresh, sour, and spicy are the characteristics of Dai cuisine. Dai people believe that eating sour foods can make their eyes bright, help digestion, and also help relieve heat. Sweet can remove fatigue. Spicy can increase appetite. Acid is considered the most delicious flavor in Dai cuisine, and all dishes and snacks are mainly sour, such as sour bamboo shoots, sour pork.

==Tai Lue in Thailand==
In Thailand there are Tai Lue in many provinces of the upper regions of Northern Thailand; these provinces are:

*Chiang Rai: Mae Sai, Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen districts (a portion fled to Chiang Rung at the outbreak of the Ayuthian-Burman War)
*Chiang Mai: Samoeng and Doi Saket districts
*Nan: Tha Wang Pha, Pua, Chiang Klang and Thung Chang districts (the greatest number, fleeing from the Saiyaburi and Sipsongpanna regions)
*Phayao: Chiang Muan and Chiang Kham districts (many in number)
*Lampang: Mueang Lampang and Mae Tha districts
*Lamphun: Mueang Lamphun and Ban Thi districts

==Festival==
The festivals of the Dai people are mostly related to religious activities. The main festivals include door closing festival, door opening festival and water splashing festival.

The closing festival is fixed on September 15 in the Dai calendar (the middle of July in the Gregorian calendar). The opening door festival, the time fixed in the Dai calendar on December 15 (the middle of October in the Gregorian calendar). In the two festivals on the same day, all of people will go to the Buddhist temple to hold ritual activities. People will offer foods, flowers and coins to the Buddha. The three months between the closing door festival and the opening door festival are the &quot;close&quot; time of the year, the most religious time of the year.

The Water Splashing Festival is a traditional festival of the Dai people, meaning the New Year of June. The time is in the late June or early July of the Dai calendar (the middle of April in the Gregorian calendar). Held about 10 days after the Qingming festival, it symbolizes &quot;the most beautiful day&quot;. The holiday usually lasts three days. In the early morning of the festival, the people of the Dai village went to the Buddhist temple to clean the figure of Buddha. After the ceremony of the Buddhist temple, the young men and women pour water on each other. Then groups of people marched around, sprinkling pedestrians as a blessing. These represent blessings.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===
The Dai are predominately Theravada Buddhists. Dai Buddhism also tolerated many pre—Buddhist animistic beliefs and practices. The Dai were animists before Buddhism became popular and their belief in natural spirits continues. Until very recently, every Dai village had at least one Buddhist temple while larger villages had two to five temples. Many of their Buddhist temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Parents commonly sent their sons (from 7 to 18 years old) to the Buddhist monasteries to become novices and to receive monastic education. The boys stay in the monasteries for three years or more while learning how to write, read, and practice the faith. Afterwards, most boys or young men would return to secular society while a handful of them remained in the monasteries to become fully ordained monks. This education system has led to high literacy rates and knowledge of the Dai script among Dai men that today exceed 80 percent.

A small minority of Dai practice Islam. These specific Dai are often called &quot;Parshi Dai&quot; or &quot;Dai Hui&quot;. Hui (Chinese Muslim) merchants from Dali and other parts of Yunnan settled in Xishuangbanna in the early nineteenth century. These settlers assimilated and intermarried with the locals which eventually led to the creation of a unique Dai and Sino-Islamic culture. The present Parshi Dai have a material culture identical to their Buddhist counterparts. They speak the same language, wear similar dress, have similar customs, rituals, and diet.

=== Literature and science ===
The Dai have historically had a rich array of astronomical and literary works. The Dai have their own calendar that begins in the year 638 and have many astronomical books on calculating solar and lunar eclipses (most written in Dai script). Historical documents, legends, stories, poetry, fables, and children&#x27;s stories are also plentiful.

=== Dwellings ===
Traditional Dai villages are mainly located in bamboo plains near rivers or streams. Dai homes are usually built on stilts and some are square in shape. A few houses are two-story with the upper story being the living space and the bottom story as a storehouse. The bottom story can sometimes be wall-less.

=== Economy ===
As an effect of living in a subtropical region, subsistence for many Dai include the use and growing of rice, coffee, rubber, tea, sugar, and many types of fruits. The Dai also have a highly developed handicraft industry which includes weaving, oil-pressing, winemaking, and bamboo work. Since the 1980s, tourism has become a source of revenue for the Dai in Xishuangbanna in consequence of airports being built in Jinghong and Mangshi. The increase of infrastructure and living standards in the region has led the Dai to assimilate into the mainstream Chinese economy better than other minorities.

=== Marriage and women&#x27;s roles ===
Historically, marriage was mainly between members of similar social or economic class and polygamy was common among chieftains. Dai society has traditionally been patriarchal with women having low status and unable to inherit property. Girls (from age 7 or 8) were responsible for caring for younger children and domestic duties. When they became older, working in the rice fields to clear weeds, harvest, plant, etc. was included into their responsibilities. Today, Dai women and youth have more freedoms then they did in the past and some women (with access to education) have entered into professional careers like teaching or nursing.

<text>Dame Muriel Sarah Spark (; 1 February 1918 – 13 April 2006) was a Scottish novelist, short story writer, poet and essayist.

==Life==
Muriel Camberg was born in the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer, and Sarah Elizabeth Maud (née Uezzell). Her father was Jewish, born in Edinburgh of Lithuanian immigrant parents, and her English mother had been raised Anglican. She was educated at James Gillespie&#x27;s School for Girls (1923–35), where she received some education in the Presbyterian faith. In 1934–35 she took a course in &quot;commercial correspondence and précis writing&quot; at Heriot-Watt College. She taught English for a brief time and then worked as a secretary in a department store.

In 1937 she became engaged to Sidney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, whom she had met in Edinburgh. In August of that year, she followed him to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and they were married on 3 September 1937 in Salisbury. Their son Samuel Robin was born in July 1938. Within months she discovered that her husband was manic depressive and prone to violent outbursts. In 1940 Muriel left Sidney and temporarily placed Robin in a convent school, as children were not permitted to travel during the war. Spark returned to Britain in early 1944, taking residence at the Helena Club in London. She worked in intelligence for the remainder of World War II. She provided money at regular intervals to support her son. Spark maintained it was her intention for her family to set up a home in England, but Robin returned to Britain with his father later to be brought up by his maternal grandparents in Scotland.

Between 1955 and 1965 she lived in a bedsit at 13 Baldwin Crescent, Camberwell, south-east London. After living in New York City for some years, she moved to Rome, where she met artist and sculptor Penelope Jardine in 1968. In the early 1970s, they settled in Tuscany, in the village of Oliveto, near to Civitella in Val di Chiana, of which in 2005 Spark was made an honorary citizen. She was the subject of frequent rumours of lesbian relationships from her time in New York onwards, although Spark and her friends denied their validity. She left her entire estate to Jardine, taking measures to ensure that her son received nothing.

Spark died in 2006 and is buried in the cemetery of Sant&#x27;Andrea Apostolo in Oliveto.

==Literary career==
Spark began writing seriously, under her married name, after World War II, beginning with poetry and literary criticism. In 1947 she became editor of the &quot;Poetry Review&quot;. This position made Spark one of the few female editors of the time. Spark left the &quot;Poetry Review&quot; in 1948. In 1953 Muriel Spark was baptized in the Church of England but in 1954 she decided to join the Roman Catholic Church, which she considered crucial in her development toward becoming a novelist. She was formally instructed by Dom Ambrose Agius, a Benedictine monk of Ealing Priory, whom she had known from her Poetry Society days, and was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 1st May 1954 by Dom Ambrose. Penelope Fitzgerald, a fellow novelist and contemporary of Spark, wrote that Spark &quot;had pointed out that it wasn&#x27;t until she became a Roman Catholic ... that she was able to see human existence as a whole, as a novelist needs to do&quot;. In an interview with John Tusa on BBC Radio 4, she said of her conversion and its effect on her writing that she &quot;was just a little worried, tentative. Would it be right, would it not be right? Can I write a novel about that – would it be foolish, wouldn&#x27;t it be? And somehow with my religion – whether one has anything to do with the other, I don&#x27;t know – but it does seem so, that I just gained confidence.&quot; Graham Greene, Gabriel Fielding and Evelyn Waugh supported her in her decision.

Her first novel, &quot;The Comforters&quot;, was published to great critical acclaim in 1957. It featured several references to Catholicism and conversion to Catholicism, although its main theme revolved around a young woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel.

&quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1961) was even more successful. Spark displayed originality of subject and tone, making extensive use of flashforwards and imagined conversations. It is clear that James Gillespie&#x27;s High School was the model for the Marcia Blaine School in the novel. Her residence at the Helena Club was the inspiration for the fictional May of Teck Club in &quot;The Girls of Slender Means&quot; published in 1963.

==Archive and biography==
In the 1940s Spark began to keep a record of her professional and personal activities that developed into a comprehensive personal archive containing diaries, accounts and cheque books and tens of thousands of letters. Spark used her archive to write her autobiography, &quot;Curriculum Vitae&quot;, and after its publication in 1992 much of the material was deposited at National Library of Scotland.

Spark refused permission for the publication of a biography of her by Martin Stannard. Penelope Jardine holds publication approval rights, and the book was posthumously published in July 2009. On 27 July 2009 Stannard was interviewed on &quot;Front Row&quot;, the BBC Radio 4 arts programme. According to A. S. Byatt, &quot;she [Jardine] was very upset by the book and had to spend a lot of time going through it, line by line, to try to make it a little bit fairer&quot;.

==Honours and acclaim==
Spark received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1965 for &quot;The Mandelbaum Gate&quot;, the Ingersoll Foundation T. S. Eliot Award for Creative Writing in 1992 and the David Cohen Prize in 1997. She became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1967 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993 for services to literature. She was twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize, in 1969 for &quot;The Public Image&quot; and in 1981 for &quot;Loitering with Intent&quot;. In 1998, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for a &quot;Lifetime&#x27;s Distinguished Service to Literature&quot;.

Spark received eight honorary doctorates including Doctor of the University degree (Honoris causa) from her alma mater, Heriot-Watt University in 1995; a Doctor of Humane Letters (Honoris causa) from the American University of Paris in 2005; and Honorary Doctor of Letters degrees from the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, London, Oxford, St Andrews and Strathclyde.

In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Spark as No. 8 in its list of &quot;the 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;. In 2010, Spark was posthumously shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize of 1970 for &quot;The Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot;.

==Relationship with her son==
Spark and her son Samuel Robin Spark at times had a strained relationship. They had a falling out when Robin&#x27;s Orthodox Judaism prompted him to petition for his late great-grandmother to be recognised as Jewish. (Spark&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Adelaide Hyams and Tom Uezzell, had married in a church. Tom was Anglican. Adelaide&#x27;s father was Jewish, but her mother was not; Adelaide referred to herself as a &quot;Jewish Gentile.&quot;) Spark reacted by accusing him of seeking publicity to advance his career as an artist. Muriel&#x27;s brother Philip, who himself had become actively Jewish, agreed with her version of the family&#x27;s history. During one of her last book signings in Edinburgh, she told a journalist who asked if she would see her son again: &quot;I think I know how best to avoid him by now.&quot;

<text>Kettering University is a private university in Flint, Michigan. It offers bachelor of science and master’s degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and business. Kettering University undergraduate students must complete at least five co-op terms to graduate. 

Kettering University is named after inventor and former head of research for General Motors, Charles F. Kettering. He was a distinguished inventor, researcher, and proponent of cooperative education.

==History==
Founded as The School of Automotive Trades by Albert Sobey under the direction of the Industrial Fellowship of Flint on October 20, 1919, Kettering University has a long legacy in the automotive industry. The university became known as the Flint Institute of Technology (Flint Tech) in 1923 before being acquired by General Motors in 1926. It was renamed as the General Motors Institute of Technology (General Motors Tech) and eventually the General Motors Institute in 1932.

Once referred to as the &quot;West Point of the Automobile industry,&quot; GMI focused on a cooperative education model that combined classroom learning with real-world job experience (following the development of this program at the University of Cincinnati in 1907). GMI also pioneered freshman-level manufacturing courses (Production Processes I &amp; II) and automotive degree specialties. In 1945, the Institute added a fifth-year thesis requirement, granting the school the ability to award degrees. The school&#x27;s first bachelor&#x27;s degree was subsequently awarded on August 23, 1946.
During the 1950s, the co-op program required applicants to find a GM division to sponsor them. School and work were mixed in four- or eight-week rotations, dividing the student body into four sections: two (A and B) for the four-week rotations and two (C and D) for the eight-week rotations. At any given time, when section A was in school, section B was at work. Every four weeks, this situation reversed. Sections C and D were scheduled similarly on an eight-week basis. With the 4-week and 8-week rotations, students shifted between school and work twelve or six times yearly during their 48-week year. Because General Motors used the school to train its engineers, they partially subsidized tuition. In June 1979 (the Class of 1984), the school expanded co-op rotations to twelve weeks.

===Split from GM===
After GM reduced operations in Flint, the company and the university separated on July 1, 1982. The institution became &quot;GMI Engineering &amp; Management Institute,&quot; keeping the initials &quot;GMI&quot; to maintain its connection with the old General Motors Institute. The university began charging full tuition as an independent private university. The university kept the cooperative education model, expanding the number of co-op employers for students. The university also began offering graduate programs for both on- and off-campus students.

===Name change and expansion of programs===
The university&#x27;s name was formally changed to Kettering University on January 1, 1998, in honor of Charles Kettering. The name change allowed the university to establish a separate identity from General Motors and to publicize their expansion of academic programs beyond automotive-related offerings.

The university launched a physics program in 1995 and the first ABET-accredited applied physics program in the world in 2013. A chemical engineering program as well as a pre-med course of study were launched in 2008. The chemical engineering program received ABET accreditation in 2013. The computer science program received ABET accreditation in 2007. The university added an applied biology program in 2013.

==Academics==
Kettering University offers Bachelor of Science (BS) and masters (MS, MBA, MBA/MSMO dual) degree programs. Some masters programs are available online following the school&#x27;s launched of distance education programs in 2015. Most undergraduate programs require completion of 160 credit hours for graduation. Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Mechanical Engineering (233)
::Electrical and Electronics Engineering (44)
::Computer Science (42)
::Computer Engineering (26)
::Industrial Engineering (24)
::Chemical Engineering (23)

=== Accreditation ===
Kettering University has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1962. Several of the university&#x27;s academic programs have specific accreditation as well:

===Rankings===
Kettering University ranked 13th nationally among non-Ph.D.-granting engineering universities and seventh nationally among mechanical engineering programs in the 2017 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;Best Colleges&quot; edition. The university also received a &quot;Best in the Midwest&quot; designation from the Princeton Review.

Kettering ranked 12th nationally and first in the Midwest and Michigan in Return on Investment in PayScale.com&#x27;s 2015 Return on Investment Rankings. PayScale.com also ranked Kettering 15th nationally and first in Michigan in its 2014 Salary Potential rankings. A 2015 CNNMoney.com article examining the top private colleges in the country in return on investment ranked Kettering 10th, noting that Kettering&#x27;s students graduated with skills employers were looking for.

An article in the 2014 issue of &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine listed Kettering University among five top universities for students aiming to enter the auto industry. The article noted Kettering University&#x27;s unique program, which prepares students for work and immerses them in it—alternating three months of school with three months of on-the-job experience, repeated until graduation.

Kettering University was ranked 137th on &quot;Business Insider&quot;″s 2014 list of &quot;The 600 Smartest Colleges in America.&quot;

===Research===
National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grants have allowed Kettering to add equipment that includes an X-Ray diffractometer, an X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument, a motion capture system, a High-Throughput and High-Resolution Three-Dimensional Tissue Scanner with Internet-Connected 3D Virtual Microscope for Large-Scale Automated Histology, and - at the time - the only 4G LTE Wireless system on a college campus in the country.

Kettering University partners with the federal government&#x27;s U.S. Ignite program, which brings super high-speed internet capabilities to Flint, Michigan. The technology will bring Flint new healthcare, crime prevention, and educational opportunities. Also, in partnership with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, Kettering University received a $1 million neighborhood stabilization grant from the United States Department of Justice in 2014.

===FIRST Robotics===
Kettering University opened the FIRST Robotics Competition Community Center in 2014. College officials said it was the first integration of a robotics center into a college campus in the country. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder attended the grand opening.

The facility provides work areas for eight FIRST teams, with space to accommodate up to 16 teams. There is also a regulation-size practice field and a machining lab. High school students on teams housed in the facility have access to Kettering University&#x27;s faculty, staff, and students as mentors and the campus facilities. Approximately 25 percent of Kettering University&#x27;s student body participated in FIRST Robotics in high school.

The facility intends to create more opportunities for pre-college students, particularly students from underserved or financially disadvantaged populations, to gain exposure to science and engineering education and career possibilities. Kettering University also received a National Science Foundation grant in 2014 to provide scholarship to academically talented financially disadvantaged students who participated in high school robotics programs.

===Cooperative and experiential learning===
All Kettering University undergraduate students must complete some form of experiential learning for every degree program. Cooperative education begins as early as a student&#x27;s freshman year. Student schedules typically alternate between academic terms that include classes and labs and full-time employment with one of Kettering&#x27;s more than 550 partner organizations. Usually, a student maintains employment with the same organization throughout the program.

Cooperative experience is paid, with freshman students earning an average of $14.20 per hour on their co-op terms and upperclassmen earning an average of $18.44 per hour. Ninety-eight percent of Kettering University graduates are employed or accepted into graduate school within six months of graduation.

==Campus==

Kettering University&#x27;s campus is situated on approximately 90 acres of land along the Flint River on the west side of Flint. In 2012, Kettering began purchasing distressed properties from the Genesee County Land Bank as part of its mission to play a leading role in the revitalization of Flint. The university demolished blighted structures and took over maintenance, mowing, and upkeep of the properties.

Kettering has received neighborhood stabilization grants from the Department of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These grants aimed to support the revitalization of neighborhoods near campus and establish a safe University Avenue Corridor (UAC), a walkable connector from Kettering&#x27;s campus to downtown Flint, the University of Michigan–Flint campus, McLaren Regional Medical Center, and Hurley Medical Center.

===Campus Master Plan===
In 2014, Kettering University unveiled a new Campus Master Plan.

The plan&#x27;s first phase of the master plan involved constructing a new mixed-use Learning Commons building to house some academic department functions, a modern library, new food service venues and options, and other resources, including increased access to flexible, technology-enabled, collaborative spaces. The building had space for visiting alums and other campus guests, integrating them into the campus community for the entirety of their visit. The $63 million learning commons facility opened in 2022.

Other phases of the campus master plan include the construction of a new residence hall, new research facilities, and a raised connector across Chevrolet Avenue that pays homage to a bridge that existed when the property was home to the General Motors Chevrolet Division. Additionally, the campus plan aimed to open the campus to better accommodate pre-college students by redeveloping the Academic Building with increased lab and community space.

===Kettering University General Motors Mobility Research Center===
In April 2015, Kettering University announced a $2 million naming donation from the General Motors Foundation to construct the Kettering University General Motors Foundation Automotive Research Area. The facility was conceived to be an automotive proving ground on a piece of campus that is the former site of the Chevrolet Division, or Chevy in the Hole. The cost for the project was $4.5 million, and it included construction of the research area on a 19-acre proving ground and an 18-acre brownfield site.

Eventually donning the name GM Mobility Research Center (MRC), the center was completed before 2023 and includes a 21-acre outdoor lab space. The outdoor lab has various areas for testing vehicle safety standards as well as hybrid and electric vehicle technologies. The MRC provides additional classroom and lab experiences for students and expands research opportunities for faculty and industry partners. At the time of its completion, it is the only facility of its kind on a college campus in the United States.

The project complements a major city of Flint project on the opposite side of the Flint River called Chevy Commons. The project converted a Flint-owned portion of Chevy in the Hole into an urban park that includes wetlands, woodlands, grasslands, green spaces, and paved recreation trails.

===Academic Building===
Kettering University&#x27;s Academic Building was the first building constructed on campus and features a prominent arched architectural entrance at the corner of N. Chevrolet Avenue and University Avenue. This front entrance is constructed with stonework and bears the insignia &quot;General Motors Institute of Technology&quot; in stone at the top of the archway. This entrance is featured in Kettering University&#x27;s seal.

The building currently includes several labs, including a polymer processing lab, an ergonomics lab, a work design Lab, applied biology labs, chemical engineering labs, an advanced power electronics lab, a haptics lab, an acoustics lab, and many other lab spaces. The building also houses McKinnon Theater, the Humanities Art Center, a library, and departmental offices.

===Campus Center===

The Campus Center is Kettering University&#x27;s main administration building. It includes the Office of the President, Student Life, Admissions and Financial Aid, University Advancement and External Relations, Alumni Engagement, Multicultural Student Initiatives, and Sponsored Research.

In addition, the Campus Center houses three food service areas and a student center. Kettering&#x27;s Campus Safety headquarters are also in the Campus Center. The Lear Corporation funded upgrades for the safety center, which included increased security enforcement and a close-circuit television surveillance system connected to feeds from security cameras throughout the campus.

The Campus Center also provides community space, including facilities for the Michigan Small Business Development Center I-69 Trade Corridor Regional Office, which supports local and regional businesses across multiple counties in Michigan, and classrooms for Oxford Virtual Academy. 

===C.S. Mott Science and Engineering Building===

The C.S. Mott Science and Engineering Building opened in 2003 and houses departmental offices as well as classroom space for Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and Biochemistry. The building includes several labs, including a powertrain lab, Kettering University&#x27;s Crash Safety Center, a fuel cell lab, bioengineering labs, and other core science and engineering labs for students. The building also houses T-Space, a student-driven lab with activities encouraging an entrepreneurial mindset and access to tools such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and soldering for making electric and mechanical prototypes.

===Frances Willson Thompson Hall===

Kettering University&#x27;s residence hall is the sole on-campus student housing facility. All students are required to live in the residence hall during their freshman year.

===Connie and Jim John Recreation Center===

Kettering&#x27;s recreation center opened in 1995 and includes a 25-yard pool, indoor track, tennis, basketball, and racquetball courts, free weights, exercise equipment, an aerobics room, and meeting rooms. Kettering University&#x27;s commencement ceremonies are typically hosted in the recreation center. 

===Learning Commons===

Completed in 2022 and featuring an open-air atrium at its center, the Learning Commons building is home to a new cafeteria, coffee shop, auditorium, IT service desks, outdoor terraces, rooftop gardens, and over a dozen multi-use spaces for students to use to study and collaborate.

===Innovation Center===

The Innovation Center at Kettering University, a 9,000-square-foot incubator for entrepreneurs, opened in 2010. The Innovation Center was the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified building in Genesee County.

===Atwood Stadium===

Kettering University acquired Atwood Stadium, an 11,000-seat stadium that was previously designated a city park, from the city of Flint in 2013. The stadium opened in 1929.

Kettering has made major repairs to the stadium, including fixing masonry work, restrooms, concessions areas, locker rooms, and lighting. in 2015, Kettering University replaced the turf in the stadium with a state-of-the-art field turf, making Atwood one of only three venues in the state of Michigan (the others are Ford Field and Michigan Stadium) with this field surface. With the replacement of the field surface, the field was expanded and lined to support NCAA/MLS soccer and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse play in addition to football.

Kettering University has constructed temporary ice rinks in the stadium and offered free open ice skating in the winters of 2014 and 2015.

===Flint Children&#x27;s Museum===

The Flint Children&#x27;s Museum, located on the campus of Kettering University, offers hands-on experiences for children ages two to ten. The museum features rotating exhibits that change every three months. Exhibit themes include How Things Work, Performing Arts, Health and Fitness, Our Town, and Discovery Zone.

The museum also features an outdoor educational area called Sproutside. The learning area was constructed in 2007 with support from the Ruth Mott Foundation and the Community Foundation of Greater Flint.

==Student life==
Nearly half of Kettering University&#x27;s student body lives in the university&#x27;s residence hall or in the Campus Village Apartments complex adjacent to campus. Many others live near campus in fraternity and sorority housing or private rentals, making the university&#x27;s campus community close-knit. A variety of activities and organizations give students plenty of social outlets on and near campus.

===Kettering LEADERS Fellowship===
In 1999, 31 graduating seniors committed to donating $10,000 each over 10 years to build up an endowment dedicated to student leadership development at Kettering University. Since then, the endowment has grown to over $450,000. The selective program is now known as the Kettering LEADERS Fellowship.

===SAE Competition Teams===
Kettering University competes in the Society of Automotive Engineering’s Collegiate Design Series by building competition vehicles to compete in the Baja SAE, Formula SAE, SAE Aero Design, and SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge competitions. In 2018, Kettering University began competing in the SAE AutoDrive Challenge, in which students convert a Chevrolet Bolt vehicle into a SAE level 4 autonomous vehicle by the 3rd year of competition.

Each year, students design and build vehicles for national and international competitions. In 2015, Kettering&#x27;s Clean Snowmobile Challenge team finished in the top two at its international competition for the fourth straight year (including a first-place finish in 2014). The Formula SAE team finished fourth out of 100 schools in competition in Brooklyn, Michigan in 2022. Previously, the Formula SAE team finished tenth at its competition in Lincoln, Nebraska in 2014, following a seventh-place finish in 2013.

Kettering University has a collegiate DECA team. Kettering students won 13 awards at a state of Michigan competition in 2015 and three awards at the international conference in Washington D.C. in 2014.

===Model United Nations===
Kettering University has a student Model United Nations (MUN) team. MUN teams feature students that roleplay as United Nations delegates and simulate United Nations committees at conferences or competitions.

Kettering University&#x27;s team, which was formed in 2010, won its first-ever prize at an international competition at Model United Nations in the United States in November 2014 and won prizes at Harvard University in 2015 as well.

===Greek life===
Greek Life on the Kettering/GMI campus began in 1921. The first officially recognized organization was not formed until 5 years later as the White Elephants. Several other local fraternities would appear on campus during the following years. However, because during this time GMI was not accredited, no national/international recognized fraternities appeared on campus. When GMI did receive accreditation in 1962, the university would require all local fraternities to join a national/international fraternity. Many of the current fraternities on campus came from that transition. Kettering University has an active Greek system.

Many North American Interfraternity Conference (IFC) fraternities have chapters at Kettering as do several National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) has several local chapters that are also affiliated with Kettering. IFC, NPC, and NPHC each have a school-wide council with representatives from each member organization. These councils are designed to facilitate communication between the different groups, and to facilitate relations with the university on matters such as school-wide events and membership.

===Intramural sports===
Kettering University offers intramural sports opportunities to students year-round. Sports offered include basketball, flag football, softball, soccer, volleyball, innertube water polo, outdoor broomball, volleyball, racquetball, Wiffleball home run derby, and more. The campus includes indoor basketball, tennis, and racquetball courts, a swimming pool, an indoor track, an outdoor track, softball and soccer fields, a sand volleyball court, and Atwood Stadium.

===Student media===
The low-power radio station WKUF-LP (94.3 FM) is run by Kettering University students and staff. It was founded in November 2004 and features music from several genres and talk programs from a variety of hosts.

Kettering University also has a student-run newspaper called &quot;The Technician&quot;. A print edition is published three times per term; an edition is also published online.

==Notable alumni==

Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, is a 1985 Kettering University graduate. Barra and former General Motors President Edward Nicholas Cole, a 1933 Kettering University graduate, who have appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

Henry Juszkiewicz, a 1976 graduate, is the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitar Corporation.

<doc id="218089" wikidata="Q6942769" url="?curid=218089" title="Muskegon River">
<text>The Muskegon River ( ) is a river in the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. From its source at Houghton Lake in Roscommon County, the river flows in a generally southwesterly direction to its mouth at Lake Michigan at the eponymous city of Muskegon. The river drains an area of , and collects a number of tributaries, including the Little Muskegon River, Hersey River, and Clam River.

In September 2002, an article in National Geographic raised concerns about a controversial deal made with Nestlé Waters North America, giving them permission &quot;to bottle up to 210 million gallons (about 800 million liters) a year from an aquifer north of Grand Rapids, Michigan that recharges the Muskegon River&quot;.

== Description of the watershed ==
The Muskegon River watershed drains 2,350 square miles (6,100 km2) from ten counties in north central Michigan: Muskegon, Newaygo, Mecosta, Clare, Osceola, and Roscommon. The watershed flows through the cities of Muskegon, Newaygo, Big Rapids, Evart, and Houghton Lake. The river follows a southwesterly route through north central Michigan from its headwaters at Houghton Lake to its mouth at Muskegon Lake, which ultimately empties into Lake Michigan.

There are three man-made reservoirs on the Muskegon River, the Rogers Dam Pond, Hardy Dam Pond, and the Croton Dam Pond. All three dams on the river are owned and operated by Consumers Power for power generation purposes. Rogers Dam is located in Mecosta County south of Big Rapids, with Hardy Dam and Croton Dam located in Newaygo County.

==History==
Like many of its neighboring streams, the Muskegon was one of the favored logging rivers during the boom years of the 1880s-1890s. Remnants of stray logs embedded on the river bottom, left over from the spring logging runs, can still be seen along the river. The river is significant to the Algonquian peoples for fishing and hunting.

Winfield Scott Gerrish established a seven-mile-long logging railroad from Lake George to the Muskegon River. However, there were several Michigan logging railroads in operation in the 1850s, including the seven-mile-long Blendon Lumber Company railroad in Ottawa County, which was the first in the state to employ a steam locomotive in May 1857.

==Wildlife==
There is abundant wildlife, including black bear, otters, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, and bald eagles and, despite increasing development, some areas are still fairly remote and natural with much of the surrounding land composed of state-owned tracts.

The Muskegon State Game Area is an 8,411 acre section of land which overlays the Muskegon River on the section between Maple Island Road and US Route 31. This state game area is accessible for licensed hunters. Permits can be obtained for whitetail deer hunting and waterfowl hunting. The Muskegon State Game Area spans both Muskegon County and Newaygo County.

==Recreation==
*The river is popular for recreational fishing for large migratory steelhead, brown trout and planted Chinook Salmon.
*Due to its slow speed and length (being shorter only then the Grand River), the river is popular for Kayaking and Canoeing.
Camping is another popular activity around the river, with several shoreline parks and campgrounds.
Hunting is popular in the forests near by on public hunting land.

== Crossings ==

There are approximately 31 bridge crossings over the Muskegon River waterway. These bridge crossing include motorized vehicle crossings, railroads, and several pedestrian/bicycle trail crossings. The majority of the bicycle and pedestrian trail crossings are former railroad bridges which have been converted to non-motorized traffic.

==Dams==
The three major dams of the Muskegon River (Rogers, Hardy and Croton) generate about 45,600 kilowatts, with about 30,000 of that from Hardy Dam. This provides enough electricity to serve a community of nearly 23,000. The smaller Reedsburg Dam is near the source of the Muskegon River.
== Cities and towns along the river ==

* Houghton Lake, Michigan
* Leota, Michigan
* Evart, Michigan
* Hersey, Michigan
* Big Rapids, Michigan

<doc id="218091" wikidata="Q2029236" url="?curid=218091" title="Stream function">
<text>In fluid dynamics, two types of stream function are defined:
* The two-dimensional (or Lagrange) stream function, introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1781, is defined for incompressible (divergence-free), two-dimensional flows.
* The Stokes stream function, named after George Gabriel Stokes, is defined for incompressible, three-dimensional flows with axisymmetry.
The properties of stream functions make them useful for analyzing and graphically illustrating flows.

The remainder of this article describes the two-dimensional stream function.

== Two-dimensional stream function ==

=== Assumptions ===
The two-dimensional stream function is based on the following assumptions:
* The space domain is three-dimensional.
* The flow field can be described as two-dimensional plane flow, with velocity vector
:formula_1
* The velocity satisfies the continuity equation for incompressible flow:
:formula_2

Although in principle the stream function doesn&#x27;t require the use of a particular coordinate system, for convenience the description presented here uses a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates formula_3.

=== Derivation ===
==== The test surface ====
Consider two points formula_4 and formula_5 in the formula_6 plane, and a continuous curve formula_7, also in the formula_6 plane, that connects them. Then every point on the curve formula_7 has formula_10 coordinate formula_11. Let the total length of the curve formula_7 be formula_13.

Suppose a ribbon-shaped surface is created by extending the curve formula_7 upward to the horizontal plane formula_15 formula_16, where formula_17 is the thickness of the flow. Then the surface has length formula_13, width formula_17, and area formula_20. Call this the &quot;test surface&quot;.

==== Flux through the test surface ====

The total volumetric flux through the test surface is
:formula_21
where formula_22 is an arc-length parameter defined on the curve formula_7, with formula_24 at the point formula_4 and formula_26 at the point formula_5.
Here formula_28 is the unit vector perpendicular to the test surface, i.e.,
:formula_29
where formula_30 is the formula_31 rotation matrix corresponding to a formula_32 anticlockwise rotation about the positive formula_10 axis:
:formula_34
The integrand in the expression for formula_35 is independent of formula_10, so the outer integral can be evaluated to yield
:formula_37

==== Classical definition ====
Lamb and Batchelor define the stream function formula_38 as follows. 

:formula_39

Using the expression derived above for the total volumetric flux, formula_35, this can be written as

:formula_41.

In words, the stream function formula_38 is the volumetric flux through the test surface per unit thickness, where thickness is measured perpendicular to the plane of flow.

The point formula_4 is a reference point that defines where the stream function is identically zero. Its position is chosen more or less arbitrarily and, once chosen, typically remains fixed.

An infinitesimal shift formula_44 in the position of point formula_5 results in the following change of the stream function:

:formula_46.

From the exact differential 

:formula_47

so the flow velocity components in relation to the stream function formula_38 must be

:formula_49

Notice that the stream function is linear in the velocity. Consequently if two incompressible flow fields are superimposed, then the stream function of the resultant flow field is the algebraic sum of the stream functions of the two original fields.

=== Effect of shift in position of reference point ===
Consider a shift in the position of the reference point, say from formula_4 to formula_51. Let formula_52 denote the stream function relative to the shifted reference point formula_51:
:formula_54
Then the stream function is shifted by
:formula_55
which implies the following:
* A shift in the position of the reference point effectively adds a constant (for steady flow) or a function solely of time (for nonsteady flow) to the stream function formula_38 at every point formula_5.
* The shift in the stream function, formula_58, is equal to the total volumetric flux, per unit thickness, through the continuous surface that extends from point formula_51 to point formula_4. Consequently formula_61 if and only if formula_4 and formula_51 lie on the same streamline.

=== In terms of vector rotation ===
The velocity formula_64 can be expressed in terms of the stream function formula_38 as
:formula_66
where formula_30 is the formula_31 rotation matrix corresponding to a formula_32 anticlockwise rotation about the positive formula_10 axis. Solving the above equation for formula_71 produces the equivalent form
:formula_72
From these forms it is immediately evident that the vectors formula_64 and formula_71 are
* perpendicular: formula_75
* of the same length: formula_76.
Additionally, the compactness of the rotation form facilitates manipulations (e.g., see Condition of existence).

=== In terms of vector potential and stream surfaces ===
Using the stream function, one can express the velocity in terms of the vector potential formula_77
:formula_78
where formula_79, and formula_80 is the unit vector pointing in the positive formula_10 direction. This can also be written as the vector cross product
:formula_82
where we&#x27;ve used the vector calculus identity
:formula_83
Noting that formula_84, and defining formula_85, one can express the velocity field as
:formula_86
This form shows that the level surfaces of formula_38 and the level surfaces of formula_10 (i.e., horizontal planes) form a system of orthogonal stream surfaces.

=== Alternative (opposite sign) definition ===
An alternative definition, sometimes used in meteorology and oceanography, is
:formula_89

=== Relation to vorticity ===

In two-dimensional plane flow, the vorticity vector, defined as formula_90, reduces to formula_91, where
:formula_92
or
:formula_93
These are forms of Poisson&#x27;s equation.

=== Relation to streamlines ===

Consider two-dimensional plane flow with two infinitesimally close points formula_94 and formula_95 lying in the same horizontal plane. From calculus, the corresponding infinitesimal difference between the values of the stream function at the two points is

:formula_96

Suppose formula_38 takes the same value, say formula_98, at the two points formula_5 and formula_100. Then this gives

:formula_101

implying that the vector formula_71 is normal to the surface formula_103. Because formula_104 everywhere (e.g., see In terms of vector rotation), each streamline corresponds to the intersection of a particular stream surface and a particular horizontal plane. Consequently, in three dimensions, unambiguous identification of any particular streamline requires that one specify corresponding values of both the stream function and the elevation (formula_10 coordinate).

The development here assumes the space domain is three-dimensional. The concept of stream function can also be developed in the context of a two-dimensional space domain. In that case level sets of the stream function are curves rather than surfaces, and streamlines are level curves of the stream function. Consequently, in two dimensions, unambiguous identification of any particular streamline requires that one specify the corresponding value of the stream function only.

=== Condition of existence ===

It&#x27;s straightforward to show that for two-dimensional plane flow formula_64 satisfies the curl-divergence equation
:formula_107
where formula_30 is the formula_31 rotation matrix corresponding to a formula_32 anticlockwise rotation about the positive formula_10 axis. This equation holds regardless of whether or not the flow is incompressible.

If the flow is incompressible (i.e., formula_112), then the curl-divergence equation gives
:formula_113.
Then by Stokes&#x27; theorem the line integral of formula_114 over every closed loop vanishes
:formula_115
Hence, the line integral of formula_114 is path-independent. Finally, by the converse of the gradient theorem, a scalar function formula_117 exists such that
:formula_118.
Here formula_38 represents the stream function.

Conversely, if the stream function exists, then formula_118. Substituting this result into the curl-divergence equation yields formula_112 (i.e., the flow is incompressible).

In summary, the stream function for two-dimensional plane flow exists if and only if the flow is incompressible.

=== Potential flow ===
For two-dimensional potential flow, streamlines are perpendicular to equipotential lines. Taken together with the velocity potential, the stream function may be used to derive a complex potential. In other words, the stream function accounts for the solenoidal part of a two-dimensional Helmholtz decomposition, while the velocity potential accounts for the irrotational part.

=== Summary of properties ===
The basic properties of two-dimensional stream functions can be summarized as follows:
# The &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-components of the flow velocity at a given point are given by the partial derivatives of the stream function at that point.
# The value of the stream function is constant along every streamline (streamlines represent the trajectories of particles in steady flow). That is, in two dimensions each streamline is a level curve of the stream function.
# The difference between the stream function values at any two points gives the volumetric flux through the vertical surface that connects the two points.

== Two-dimensional stream function for flows with time-invariant density==
If the fluid density is time-invariant at all points within the flow, i.e.,

:formula_122,

then the continuity equation (e.g., see Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics) for two-dimensional plane flow becomes

:formula_123

In this case the stream function formula_38 is defined such that

:formula_125

and represents the mass flux (rather than volumetric flux) per unit thickness through the test surface.

<text>Eulophia, commonly known as corduroy orchids, is a genus of about two hundred species of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Most &quot;Eulophia&quot; orchids are terrestrial but some are deciduous while others are evergreen. They either have an underground rhizome or pseudobulbs on the surface and those species with leaves have them on the end of a fleshy stem. The flowers are arranged on a thin flowering spike, the flowers having sepals which are larger than the petals. The genus is widely distributed but most species are found in Africa and Asia, usually growing in shady places with grass or shrubs in forests.

==Description==
Orchids in the genus &quot;Eulophia&quot; are mostly terrestrial herbs with either an underground rhizome or pseudobulbs on the surface. The only two epiphytic species occur on Madagascar. Many species have no leaves, but when leaves are present they are long and narrow, sometimes . The flowers are borne on a flowering stem which sometimes appears before the leaves with a few to many flowers. The flowers in some species are small but others have large, showy flowers in a wide range of colours. The sepals are usually larger than the petals but the labellum has three lobes and a spur or pouch at its base.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Eulophia&quot; was first formally described by John Lindley in 1821 and the description was published in &quot;The Botanical Register&quot;. Because Robert Brown had previously used the name &quot;Eulophia&quot; in describing &quot;Lissochilus speciosus&quot;, and the name of that species was changed to &quot;Eulophia speciosa&quot;, Brown is the accepted author of the name. &quot;Eulophia&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;eu&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot;, &quot;well&quot; or &quot;true&quot; and &quot;lophos&quot; meaning &quot;mane&quot;, &quot;crest&quot;, &quot;comb&quot;, &quot;tuft&quot; or &quot;ridge&quot;, possibly referring to the labellum callus of some species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Orchids in the genus &quot;Eulophia&quot; are distributed in shady rainforests or in open scrub or woodland in the tropics and subtropics of Africa, India, Asia, Queensland, and the Americas, although most are found in Africa. Many can survive the dry season through their large bulbous ‘corms’. Some species, such as &quot;Eulophia petersii&quot;, have adapted to very arid environments and are among the few orchids to have truly evolved desert living species.

==Use in horticulture==
In the frost-free, semi-arid areas of Southern California, many &quot;Eulophia&quot; species, such as &quot;E. macra&quot;, &quot;E. petersii&quot;, &quot;E. plantaginea&quot;, and &quot;E. speciosa&quot;, can be grown outdoors year-round in well-drained pots with cactus/succulent potting mix (although &quot;E. speciosa&quot; prefers being grown in pure white sand), as long as they are given ample light through the winter and a drier winter resting period. Warmer growers, such as &quot;E. pulchra&quot; and possibly even the extremely rare and difficult &quot;E. cucullata&quot; (the foxglove orchid), can probably be grown outdoors in the warmer south areas of Florida and Hawaii, also. The generally large, underground, fleshy rhizome indicates a sympodial growth habit, and this makes Eulophias fairly easy to divide and propagate, provided the grower is gentle.

<doc id="218103" wikidata="Q1143007" url="?curid=218103" title="Renfe Feve">
<text>Renfe Cercanías AM, formerly known as Renfe Feve, is a division of state-owned Spanish railway company Renfe Operadora. It operates most of Spain&#x27;s of metre-gauge railway. This division of Renfe was previously a stand-alone company named FEVE (&quot;Ferrocarriles de Vía Estrecha,&quot; Spanish for &quot;Narrow-Gauge Railways). On 31 December 2012, the Spanish government simplified the organization of state-owned railway companies by merging FEVE into Renfe and Adif. The rolling stock and the brand FEVE were transferred to Renfe (renamed &quot;Renfe Feve&quot;), while the infrastructure was transferred to Adif.

==History==
FEVE was created in 1965, as a successor to the government-run organisation EFE (Explotación de Ferrocarriles por el Estado), which was created by the Miguel Primo de Rivera administration in 1926 to take over failed private railways. Following the creation of RENFE in 1941, to which the ownership of all Spanish broad-gauge railways were transferred to, EFE had in practice become the operator of a collection of exclusively narrow-gauge lines. The present status of FEVE, as a government-owned commercial company, dates from 1965.

The new company continued to absorb independent railway lines (, , , &amp; ), where the existing concession holders had been unable to be profitable. Most were converted to (if not already built in that gauge). However, from 1978 onwards, with the introduction of regional devolution under the new Spanish constitution, FEVE also began transferring responsibility for a number of its operations to the new regional governments. This happened in Catalonia (FGC) in 1979, in a portion of the Basque (Euskotren) network in 1982, in the Valencian Community (FGV) in 1986, and with the Majorcan Railways (SFM) in 1994. That did not however occur in the Region of Murcia, where the narrow-gauge railway network remained under FEVE control. The above-mentioned EFE (Explotación de Ferrocarriles por el Estado) also operated the Carabanchel – Chamartín de la Rosa suburbano railway in the city of Madrid. That railway became part of the Madrid Metro when control of that line was transferred to the Community of Madrid in the early-1980s, later integrated as the present-day Line 10.

On 31 December 2012, the company disappeared due to the merger of the narrow gauge network FEVE and the broad gauge network RENFE. The infrastructure was transferred to Adif and the rolling stock was transferred to Renfe Operadora. The operation of the narrow gauge network continued under the same conditions after the reorganization.

==FEVE network==

The great majority of the narrow-gauge lines that were operated by FEVE before it disappeared were located along or near Spain&#x27;s Atlantic Ocean and Bay of Biscay coastline, which stretches from Galicia in the northwest, through Asturias and Cantabria to the Basque Country (with a branch extending into Castile and León). Together they formed a large and strategically important system, which was why – unlike the other, more isolated regional railways – they have been retained under the integrated management of FEVE.

FEVE operated of track, of which were electrified.

===&quot;Transcantábrico&quot; line===
An exclusive tourist service operated by FEVE is a long line, the &quot;Transcantábrico&quot;, which runs along the entire length of Spain&#x27;s north coast, and has connected the cities of San Sebastián, Bilbao, Santander, Oviedo and Ferrol to Leon since 1982. Operated as a holiday service, the carriages of the train are furnished with bedrooms, lounges and restaurants and voyages typically last eight days and seven nights.

FEVE also operated &quot;normal&quot; regional (express and stopping) services (in sections) from Ferrol to Hendaye (some sections operated now by regional operators). One of the longest regular (non-tourist) FEVE service operated between Leon and Bilbao (a journey of some 7 hours).

===Commuter services===
FEVE also operated a range of or commuter services. The main commuter area is Cercanías Asturias, where the dense five-line FEVE network was totally integrated with the RENFE lines and works effectively as a regional metro system.

The Bilbao area has a line running from Bilbao&#x27;s Concordia station to the town of Balmaseda, calling at local villages and settlements on its way through Biscay, as well as the main towns of Sodupe, Aranguren, and Zalla.

Two commuter lines begin at Santander railway station and terminate at Liérganes and Cabezón de la Sal.

In southern Spain, Renfe Feve operates the historic Cartagena–Los Nietos line.

===Goods operations===


FEVE&#x27;s rails transported approximately 460 million tonnes of goods each year, accounting for a large part of the company&#x27;s business. The products one may expect to see on board their goods trains include iron, steel and coal, fueling much of the country&#x27;s industry.

<doc id="218107" wikidata="Q854556" url="?curid=218107" title="Australo-Melanesian">
<text>Australo-Melanesians (also known as Australasians or the Australomelanesoid, Australoid or Australioid race) is an outdated historical grouping of various people indigenous to Melanesia and Australia. Controversially, some groups found in parts of Southeast Asia and South Asia were also sometimes included.
While most authors included Papuans, Aboriginal Australians and Melanesians (mainly from Fiji, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), there was controversy about the inclusion of the various Southeast Asian populations grouped as &quot;Negrito&quot;, or a number of dark-skinned tribal populations of the Indian subcontinent.

The concept of dividing humankind into three, four or five races (often called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid, and Australoid) was introduced in the 18th century and further developed by Western scholars in the context of &quot;racist ideologies&quot; during the age of colonialism. With the rise of modern genetics, the concept of distinct human races in a biological sense has become obsolete. In 2019, the American Association of Biological Anthropologists stated: &quot;The belief in “races” as natural aspects of human biology, and the structures of inequality (racism) that emerge from such beliefs, are among the most damaging elements in the human experience both today and in the past.&quot;

==Terminological history==

The term &quot;Australoid&quot; was coined in ethnology in the mid 19th century, describing tribes or populations &quot;of the type of native Australians&quot;. The term &quot;Australioid race&quot; was introduced by Thomas Huxley in 1870 to refer to certain peoples indigenous to South and Southeast Asia and Oceania. In physical anthropology, &quot;Australoid&quot; is used for morphological features characteristic of Aboriginal Australians by Daniel John Cunningham in his &quot;Text-book of Anatomy&quot; (1902). An &quot;Australioid&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;, with an additional &quot;-i-&quot;) racial group was first proposed by Thomas Huxley in an essay &quot;On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind&quot; (1870), in which he divided humanity into four principal groups (Xanthochroic, Mongoloid, Negroid, and Australioid). His original model included the native inhabitants of Deccan in India under the Australoid category, specifically &quot;in a well-marked form&quot; among the hill tribes of the Deccan Plateau. Huxley further classified the Melanochroi (Peoples of the Mediterranean race) as a mixture of the Xanthochroi (northern Europeans) and Australioids.

Huxley (1870) described Australioids as dolichocephalic; their hair as usually silky, black and wavy or curly, with large, heavy jaws and prognathism, with skin the color of chocolate and irises which are dark brown or black.

The term &quot;Proto-Australoid&quot; was used by Roland Burrage Dixon in his &quot;Racial History of Man&quot; (1923). In &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; (1962), Carleton Coon expounded his system of five races (Australoid, Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Congoid and Capoid) with separate origins. Based on such evidence as claiming Australoids had the largest, megadont teeth, this group was assessed by Coon as being the most archaic and therefore the most primitive and backward. Coon&#x27;s methods and conclusions were later discredited and show either a &quot;poor understanding of human cultural history and evolution or his use of ethnology for a racialist agenda.&quot;

Terms associated with outdated notions of racial types, such as those ending in &quot;-oid&quot; have come to be seen as potentially offensive and related to scientific racism.

== Controversies ==

The populations grouped as &quot;Negrito&quot;, such as the Andamanese (from the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean), the Semang and Batek peoples (from Malaysia), the Maniq people (from Thailand), the Aeta people, the Ati people, and certain other ethnic groups in the Philippines, the Vedda people of Sri Lanka and a number of dark-skinned tribal populations in the interior of the Indian subcontinent (some Dravidian-speaking tribes and Austroasiatic-speaking Munda peoples) were also suggested by some to belong to the Australo-Melanesian group, but there were controversies about this inclusion.

The inclusion of Indian tribes in the group was not well-defined, and was closely related to the question of the original peopling of India, and the possible shared ancestry between Indian, Andamanese, and Sahulian populations of the Upper Paleolithic.

The suggested Australo-Melanesian ancestry of the original South Asian populations has long remained an open question. It was embraced by Indian anthropologists as emphasising the deep antiquity of Indian prehistory. Australo-Melanesian hunter-gatherer and fisherman tribes of the interior of India were identified with the Nishada Kingdom described in the Mahabharata. Panchanan Mitra (1923) following Vincenzo Giuffrida-Ruggeri (1913) recognises a Pre-Dravidian &quot;Australo-Veddaic&quot; stratum in India.

Alternatively, the Dravidians themselves have been claimed as originally of Australo-Melanesian stock, a view held by Biraja Sankar Guha among others.

South Indian tribes specifically described as having Australo-Melanesian affinities include the Oraon, Munda, Santal, Bhil, Gondi, the Kadars of Kerala, the Kurumba and Irula of the Nilgiris, the Paniyans of Malabar, the Uralis, Kannikars, Muthuvan and Chenchus.

In 1953, the Australoid race were believed to be part of the &quot;Archaic Caucasoid race&quot;, along with Ainus, Dravidians and Veddas.

== Criticism based on modern genetics ==

After discussing various criteria used in biology to define subspecies or races, Alan R. Templeton concludes in 2016: &quot;[T]he answer to the question whether races exist in humans is clear and unambiguous: no.&quot;

The Pan-Asian genome project concluded that Negrito populations in Malaysia and the Negrito populations in the Philippines were more closely related to non-Negrito local populations, rather than to each other, highlighting the non-existence of a distinct Australo-Melanesian grouping.

<text>Plymouth Colony (sometimes spelled Plimouth) was the first permanent English colony in New England from 1620 and the third permanent English colony in America, after Newfoundland and the Jamestown Colony. It was settled by the passengers on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; at a location that had previously been surveyed and named by Captain John Smith. The settlement served as the capital of the colony and developed as the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of what is now the southeastern portion of Massachusetts. Many of the people and events surrounding Plymouth Colony have become part of American folklore, including the American tradition of Thanksgiving and the monument of Plymouth Rock.

Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of Protestant Separatists initially known as the Brownist Emigration, who came to be known as the Pilgrims. The colony established a treaty with Wampanoag chief Massasoit which helped to ensure its success; in this, they were aided by Squanto, a member of the Patuxet tribe. Plymouth played a central role in King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1678), one of several Indian Wars, but the colony was ultimately merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other territories in 1691 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.
Despite the colony&#x27;s relatively short existence, Plymouth holds a special role in American history. The social and legal systems of the colony became closely tied to their religious beliefs, as well as to English custom.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of Brownists (a sect of English Protestant dissenters) who came to be known as the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40 percent of the adults and 56 percent of the family groupings) were part of a congregation led in America by William Bradford and William Brewster. They began to feel the pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left England in 1608 and moved to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.

In Leiden, the congregation gained the freedom to worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and they found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. They also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618 after he published comments highly critical of the King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred the congregation to move farther from England.

The congregation obtained a land patent from the Plymouth Company in June 1619. They had declined the opportunity to settle south of Cape Cod in New Netherland because of their desire to avoid the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them to settle at the mouth of the Hudson River. They sought to finance their venture through the Merchant Adventurers, a group of businessmen who principally viewed the colony as a means of making a profit. Upon arriving in America, the Pilgrims began working to repay their debts.

Using the financing secured from the Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and the &quot;Speedwell&quot;. They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties in dealing with the Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the &quot;Speedwell&quot; in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.

=== &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage ===
&quot;Speedwell&quot; was re-rigged with larger masts before leaving Holland and setting out to meet &quot;Mayflower&quot; in Southampton, England, around the end of July 1620. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; was purchased in London. The original captains were Captain Reynolds for &quot;Speedwell&quot; and Captain Christopher Jones for &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Other passengers joined the group in Southampton, including William Brewster, who had been in hiding for the better part of a year, and a group of people known to the Leiden congregation as &quot;The Strangers&quot;. This group was largely made up of people recruited by the Merchant Adventurers to provide practical assistance to the colony and additional hands to work for the colony&#x27;s ventures. The term was also used for many of the indentured servants.

Among the Strangers were Myles Standish, who was the colony&#x27;s military leader; Christopher Martin, who had been designated by the Merchant Adventurers to act as shipboard governor during the trans-Atlantic trip; and Stephen Hopkins, a veteran of a failed colonial venture that may have inspired Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The group who later became the Leiden Leaders after the merging of ships included John Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, William Brewster, and Isaac Allerton.

The departure of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and &quot;Speedwell&quot; was beset by delays. Further disagreements with the Merchant Adventurers held up the departure in Southampton. A total of 120 passengers finally departed on August 590 on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and 30 on the &quot;Speedwell&quot;. Leaving Southampton, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; suffered significant leakage, which required the ships to immediately put in at Dartmouth. The leakage was partly caused by being overmasted and being pressed too much with sail. Repairs were completed, and a further delay ensued as they awaited favorable winds. The two ships finally set sail on August 23; they traveled only beyond Land&#x27;s End before another major leak in the &quot;Speedwell&quot; forced the expedition to return again to England, this time to the port of Plymouth. The &quot;Speedwell&quot; was found to be unseaworthy; some passengers abandoned their attempt to emigrate, while others joined the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, crowding the already heavily burdened ship. Later, it was speculated that the crew of the &quot;Speedwell&quot; had intentionally sabotaged the ship to avoid having to make the treacherous trans-Atlantic voyage. The delays had significant consequences; the cost of the repairs and port fees required that the colonists sell some of their vital provisions. More importantly, the late-autumn voyage meant that everyone had to spend the coming winter on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot; off Cape Cod in increasingly squalid conditions.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620, with 102 passengers and about 30 crew members in the small, long ship. The seas were not severe during the first month in the Atlantic but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong north-Atlantic winter gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were many obstacles throughout the trip, including multiple cases of seasickness and the bending and cracking of a main beam of the ship. One death occurred, that of William Button.

After two months at sea, they sighted land on November 9, 1620, off the coast of Cape Cod. They attempted to sail south to the designated landing site at the mouth of the Hudson but ran into trouble in the region of Pollock Rip, a shallow area of shoals between Cape Cod and Nantucket Island. With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.

=== Prior exploration and settlements ===

The Pilgrims were not the first Europeans in the area. John Cabot&#x27;s discovery of Newfoundland in 1497 had laid the foundation for the extensive English claims over the east coast of America. Cartographer Giacomo Gastaldi made one of the earliest maps of New England , but he erroneously identified Cape Breton with the Narragansett Bay and completely omitted most of the New England coast. European fishermen had also been plying the waters off the New England coast for much of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Frenchman Samuel de Champlain had explored the area extensively in 1605. He had specifically explored Plymouth Harbor, which he called &quot;Port St. Louis&quot;, and he made an extensive and detailed map of it and the surrounding lands. He showed the Patuxet village (where the town of Plymouth was later built) as a thriving settlement. However, an epidemic wiped out up to 90 percent of the Indians along the Massachusetts coast in 1617–1619, including the Patuxets, before the arrival of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The epidemic has traditionally been thought to be smallpox, but a recent analysis has concluded that it may have been a lesser-known disease called leptospirosis. The absence of any serious Indian opposition to the Pilgrims&#x27; settlement may have been a pivotal event to their success and to English colonization in America.

Popham Colony, also known as Fort St. George, was organized by the Plymouth Company (unrelated to Plymouth Colony) and founded in 1607. It was settled on the coast of Maine and was beset by internal political struggles, sickness, and weather problems. It was abandoned in 1608.

Captain John Smith of Jamestown had explored the area in 1614 and is credited with naming the region New England. He named many locations using approximations of Indian words. He gave the name &quot;Accomack&quot; to the Patuxet settlement on which the Pilgrims founded Plymouth, but he changed it to New Plymouth after consulting Prince Charles, son of King James. A map published in his 1616 work &quot;A Description of New England&quot; clearly shows the site as &quot;New Plimouth&quot;.

In the &quot;Mayflower&quot; settlers&#x27; first explorations of Cape Cod, they came across evidence that Europeans had previously spent extensive time there. They discovered remains of a European fort and uncovered a grave that contained the remains of both an adult European male and an Indian child.

=== Landings at Provincetown and Plymouth ===
The &quot;Mayflower&quot; anchored at Provincetown Harbor on November 11, 1620. The Pilgrims did not have a patent to settle this area, and some passengers began to question their right to land, objecting that there was no legal authority to establish a colony and hence no guarantee of retaining ownership over any land that they had improved. In response to this, a group of colonists drafted and signed the Mayflower Compact while still aboard the ship as it lay at anchor, which became the first governing document for the colony. The intent of the compact was to establish a means of governing the colony, though it did little more than confirm that the colony would be governed like any English town. It did, however, serve the purpose of relieving the property concerns of many of the settlers. This social contract was written and signed by 41 male passengers. It was modeled on the church covenants that Congregationalists used to form new congregations. It made clear that the colony should be governed by &quot;just and equal laws&quot;, and those who signed it promised to keep those laws.

The group remained on board the ship through the next day for prayer and worship, as it was a Sunday. They finally set foot on land at Provincetown on November 13. The first task was to rebuild a shallop, a shallow draft boat that had been built in England and disassembled for transport aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. It remained with the Pilgrims when the &quot;Mayflower&quot; returned to England. On November 15, Captain Myles Standish led a party of 16 men on an exploratory mission, during which they disturbed an Indian grave and located a buried cache of Indian corn. The following week, Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine White on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. He was the first child born to the Pilgrims in the New World. The shallop was finished on November 27, and a second expedition was undertaken using it, under the direction of &quot;Mayflower&quot; master Christopher Jones. Thirty-four men went, but the expedition was beset by bad weather; the only positive result was that they found an Indian burial ground and corn that had been intended for the dead, taking the corn for future planting. A third expedition along Cape Cod left on December 6; it resulted in a skirmish with Indians known as the &quot;First Encounter&quot; near Eastham, Massachusetts. The colonists decided to look elsewhere, having failed to secure a proper site for their settlement, and fearing that they had angered the Indians by taking their corn and firing upon them. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; left Provincetown Harbor and set sail for Plymouth Harbor.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; dropped anchor in Plymouth Harbor on December 16 and spent three days looking for a settlement site. They rejected several sites, including one on Clark&#x27;s Island and another at the mouth of the Jones River, in favor of the site of a recently abandoned settlement which had been occupied by the Patuxet tribe. The location was chosen largely for its defensive position. The settlement would be centered on two hills: Cole&#x27;s Hill, where the village would be built, and Fort Hill, where a defensive cannon would be stationed. Also important in choosing the site was the fact that the prior villagers had cleared much of the land, making agriculture relatively easy. Fresh water for the colony was provided by Town Brook and Billington Sea. There are no contemporaneous accounts to verify the legend, but Plymouth Rock is often hailed as the point where the colonists first set foot on their new homeland.

The area where the colonists settled had been identified as &quot;New Plymouth&quot; in maps which John Smith published in 1614. The colonists elected to retain the name for their own settlement, in honor of their final point of departure from Plymouth, Devon.

=== First winter ===
On December 21, 1620, the first landing party arrived at the site of Plymouth. Plans to build houses, however, were delayed by bad weather until December 23. As the building progressed, 20 men always remained ashore for security purposes while the rest of the work crews returned each night to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Women, children, and the infirm remained on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, and many had not left the ship for six months. The first structure was a common house of wattle and daub, and it took two weeks to complete in the harsh New England winter. In the following weeks, the rest of the settlement slowly took shape. The living and working structures were built on the relatively flat top of Cole&#x27;s Hill, and a wooden platform was constructed atop nearby Fort Hill to support the cannon that would defend the settlement.

During the winter, the &quot;Mayflower&quot; colonists suffered greatly from lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions on board ship. Many of the men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on Cole&#x27;s Hill. Thus, only seven residences and four common houses were constructed during the first winter out of a planned 19. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

The men of the settlement organized themselves into military orders in mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Indians, and Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By the end of the month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. John Carver was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.

On March 16, 1621, the first formal contact occurred with the Indians. Samoset was an Abenaki sagamore who was originally from Pemaquid Point in Maine. He had learned some English from fishermen and trappers in Maine, and he walked boldly into the midst of the settlement and proclaimed, &quot;Welcome, Englishmen!&quot; It was during this meeting that the Pilgrims learned how the previous residents of Patuxet had died of an epidemic. They also learned that an important leader of the region was Wampanoag Indian chief Massasoit, and they learned about Squanto (Tisquantum) who was the sole survivor from Patuxet. Squanto had spent time in Europe and spoke English quite well. Samoset spent the night in Plymouth and agreed to arrange a meeting with some of Massasoit&#x27;s men.

Massasoit and Squanto were apprehensive about the Pilgrims, as several men of his tribe had been killed by English sailors. He also knew that the Pilgrims had taken some corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto himself had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then as a freeman in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges, but Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship and had taken Squanto.

Samoset returned to Plymouth on March 22 with a delegation from Massasoit that included Squanto; Massasoit joined them shortly after, and he and Governor Carver established a formal treaty of peace after exchanging gifts. This treaty ensured that each people would not bring harm to the other, that Massasoit would send his allies to make peaceful negotiations with Plymouth, and that they would come to each other&#x27;s aid in a time of war.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; set sail for England on April 5, 1621, after being anchored for almost four months in Plymouth Harbor. Nearly half of the original 102 passengers had died during the first winter. As William Bradford wrote, &quot;of these one hundred persons who came over in this first ship together, the greatest half died in the general mortality, and most of them in two or three months&#x27; time&quot;. Several of the graves on Cole&#x27;s Hill were uncovered in 1855; their bodies were disinterred and moved to a site near Plymouth Rock.

=== First Thanksgiving ===
In November 1621, the pilgrims celebrated a feast of thanksgiving which became known in the 19th century as &quot;The First Thanksgiving&quot;. The feast was probably held in early October 1621 and was celebrated by the 53 surviving Pilgrims, along with Massasoit and 90 of his men. Three contemporaneous accounts of the event survive: &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; by William Bradford, &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; probably written by Edward Winslow, and &quot;New England&#x27;s Memorial&quot; by Plymouth Colony Secretary (and Bradford&#x27;s nephew) Capt. Nathaniel Morton. The celebration lasted three days and featured a feast which included numerous types of waterfowl, wild turkeys, and fish procured by the colonists, and five deer brought by the Wampanoags.

=== Early relations with the Native Americans ===
After the departure of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, such as using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For the first few years of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income beyond subsistence farming, buying furs from Natives, and selling to Europeans. Governor Carver suddenly died shortly after the &quot;Mayflower&quot; returned to England. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.

As promised by Massasoit, numerous Natives arrived at Plymouth throughout the middle of 1621 with pledges of peace. On July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit&#x27;s village of Sowams near Narragansett Bay. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the Plymouth colonists. Squanto remained behind and traveled throughout the area to establish trading relations with several tribes.

In late July, a boy named John Billington became lost for some time in the woods around the colony. It was reported that he was found by the Nausets, the same tribe on Cape Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The colonists organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth, and they agreed to reimburse the Nausets for the corn which they had taken in return for the boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the tribes in the area.

During their dealings with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men under the leadership of Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for him, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Standish and his men had injured several Native Americans, so the colonists offered them medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.

In May 1622, a vessel named the &quot;Sparrow&quot; arrived carrying seven men from the Merchant Adventurers whose purpose was to seek out a site for a new settlement in the area. Two ships followed shortly after carrying 60 settlers, all men. They spent July and August in Plymouth before moving north to settle in Weymouth, Massachusetts, at a settlement which they named Wessagussett. The settlement of Wessagussett was short-lived, but it provided the spark for an event that dramatically changed the political landscape between the local tribes and the settlers. Reports reached Plymouth of a military threat to Wessagussett, and Myles Standish organized a militia to defend them. However, he found that there had been no attack. He therefore decided on a pre-emptive strike, an event which historian Nathaniel Philbrick calls &quot;Standish&#x27;s raid&quot;. He lured two prominent Massachusett military leaders into a house at Wessagussett under the pretense of sharing a meal and making negotiations. Standish and his men then stabbed and killed them. Standish and his men pursued Obtakiest, a local sachem, but he escaped with three prisoners from Wessagussett; he then executed them. Within a short time, Wessagussett was disbanded, and the survivors were integrated into the town of Plymouth.

Word quickly spread among the Indigenous tribes of Standish&#x27;s attack; many Natives abandoned their villages and fled the area. As noted by Philbrick: &quot;Standish&#x27;s raid had irreparably damaged the human ecology of the region ... It was some time before a new equilibrium came to the region.&quot; Edward Winslow reports in his 1624 memoirs &quot;Good News from New England&quot; that &quot;they forsook their houses, running to and fro like men distracted, living in swamps and other desert places, and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, whereof very many are dead&quot;. The Pilgrims lost the trade in furs which they had enjoyed with the local tribes, and which was their main source of income for paying off their debts to the Merchant Adventurers. Rather than strengthening their position, Standish&#x27;s raid had disastrous consequences for the colony, as attested by William Bradford in a letter to the Merchant Adventurers: &quot;we had much damaged our trade, for there where we had most skins the Indians are run away from their habitations&quot;. The only positive effect of Standish&#x27;s raid seemed to be the increased power of the Massasoit-led Wampanoag tribe, the Pilgrims&#x27; closest ally in the region.

=== Growth of Plymouth ===
A second ship arrived in November 1621 named the &quot;Fortune&quot;, sent by the Merchant Adventurers one year after the Pilgrims first set foot in New England. It arrived with 37 new settlers for Plymouth. However, the ship had arrived unexpectedly and also without many supplies, so the additional settlers put a strain on the resources of the colony. Among the passengers of the &quot;Fortune&quot; were several of the original Leiden congregation, including William Brewster&#x27;s son Jonathan, Edward Winslow&#x27;s brother John, and Philip Delano (the family name was earlier &quot;de la Noye&quot;) whose descendants include President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The &quot;Fortune&quot; also carried a letter from the Merchant Adventurers chastising the colony for failure to return goods with the &quot;Mayflower&quot; that had been promised in return for their support. The &quot;Fortune&quot; began its return to England laden with £500 worth of goods (equivalent to £ in 2010, or $ at PPP), more than enough to keep the colonists on schedule for repayment of their debt. However, the &quot;Fortune&quot; was captured by the French before she could deliver her cargo to England, creating an even larger deficit for the colony.

In July 1623, two more ships arrived: the &quot;Anne&quot; under the command of Captain &quot;Master&quot; William Peirce and Master John Bridges, and the &quot;Little James&quot; under the command of Captain Emanuel Altham. These ships carried 96 new settlers, among them Leideners, including William Bradford&#x27;s future wife Alice and William and Mary Brewster&#x27;s daughters Patience and Fear. Some of the passengers who arrived on the &quot;Anne&quot; were either unprepared for frontier life or undesirable additions to the colony, and they returned to England the next year. According to Gleason Archer, &quot;those who remained were not willing to join the colony under the terms of the agreement with the Merchant Adventurers. They had embarked for America upon an understanding with the Adventurers that they might settle in a community of their own, or at least be free from the bonds by which the Plymouth colonists were enslaved. A letter addressed to the colonists and signed by thirteen of the merchants recited these facts and urged acceptance of the new comers on the specified terms.&quot; The new arrivals were allotted land in the area of the Eel River known as Hobs Hole, which became Wellingsley, a mile south of Plymouth Rock.

In September 1623, another ship arrived carrying settlers destined to refound the failed colony at Weymouth, and they stayed temporarily in Plymouth. In March 1624, a ship arrived bearing a few additional settlers and the first cattle. A 1627 division of cattle lists 156 colonists divided into twelve lots of thirteen colonists each. Another ship arrived in August 1629, also named the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, with 35 additional members of the Leiden congregation. Ships arrived throughout the period between 1629 and 1630 carrying new settlers, though the exact number is unknown; contemporaneous documents indicate that the colony had almost 300 people by January 1630. In 1643, the colony had an estimated 600 males fit for military service, implying a total population of about 2,000. The estimated total population of Plymouth County was 3,055 by 1690, on the eve of the colony&#x27;s merger with Massachusetts Bay. It is estimated that the entire population of the colony at the point of its dissolution was around 7,000. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 20,000 settlers had arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1630 and 1640 (a period known as the Great Migration), and the population of all New England was estimated to be about 60,000 by 1678. Plymouth was the first colony in the region, but it was much smaller than Massachusetts Bay Colony by the time that they merged.

=== Military history ===

==== Myles Standish ====

Myles Standish was the military leader of Plymouth Colony from the beginning. He was officially designated as the captain of the colony&#x27;s militia in February 1621, shortly after the arrival of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in December 1620. He organized and led the first party from the &quot;Mayflower&quot; to set foot in New England, an exploratory expedition of Cape Cod upon arrival in Provincetown Harbor. He also led the third expedition, during which Standish fired the first recorded shot by the Pilgrim settlers in an event known as the First Encounter. Standish had training in military engineering from the University of Leiden, and it was he who decided the defensive layout of the settlement when they finally arrived at Plymouth. He also organized the able-bodied men into military orders in February of the first winter. During the second winter, he helped design and organize the construction of a large palisade wall surrounding the settlement. Standish led two early military raids on Indian villages: the raid to find and punish Corbitant for his attempted coup, and the killing at Wessagussett called &quot;Standish&#x27;s raid&quot;. The former had the desired effect of gaining the respect of the local Indians; the latter only served to frighten and scatter them, resulting in loss of trade and income.

==== Pequot War and United Colonies of New England ====

The first major war in New England was the Pequot War of 1637. The war&#x27;s roots go back to 1632, when a dispute arose between Dutch fur traders and Plymouth officials over control of the Connecticut River Valley near Hartford. Representatives from the Dutch East India Company and Plymouth Colony both had deeds which claimed that they had rightfully purchased the land from the Pequots. A sort of land rush occurred as settlers from Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies tried to beat the Dutch in settling the area. Other tribes in the area sided with the English, including the Narragansetts and Mohegans, who were the traditional enemies of the Pequots. The event that sparked formal hostilities was the capture of a boat and the murder of captain John Oldham in 1636, an event blamed on allies of the Pequots.

In April 1637, a raid on a Pequot village by John Endicott led to a retaliatory raid by Pequot warriors on the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut, where some 30 English settlers were killed. This led to a further retaliation, where a raid led by Captain John Underhill and Captain John Mason burned a Pequot village to the ground in Mystic, killing 300 Pequots. Plymouth Colony had little to do with the actual fighting in the war.

When it appeared that the war would resume, four of the New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a defensive compact known as the United Colonies of New England. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, and he was the chief architect of the United Colonies. His experience in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national American government.

==== King Philip&#x27;s War ====
Metacomet was the younger son of Massasoit and the heir of Massasoit&#x27;s position as sachem of the Pokanokets and supreme leader of the Wampanoags. He was known to the colonists as Philip, and he became sachem upon the sudden death of his older brother Wamsutta in 1662, who was also known as Alexander.

Indian leaders such as Philip resented the colonists&#x27; increasing land acquisitions, and they looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was the founding of the town of Swansea, which was located only a few miles from the Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.

The proximate cause of the conflict was the death of a Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to Philip; however, Sassamon&#x27;s conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip&#x27;s most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip&#x27;s men actually committed the murder.

Philip had already begun war preparations at his home base near Mount Hope where he started raiding English farms and pillaging their property. In response, Governor Josiah Winslow called out the militia, and they organized and began to move on Philip&#x27;s position. Philip&#x27;s men attacked unarmed women and children in order to receive a ransom. One such attack resulted in the capture of Mary Rowlandson.

The war continued through the rest of 1675 and into the next year. The colonists were constantly frustrated by the Native Americans&#x27; refusal to meet them in pitched battle. They employed a form of guerrilla warfare that confounded the English. Captain Benjamin Church continuously campaigned to enlist the help of friendly Native Americans to help learn how to fight on an even footing with Philip&#x27;s warrior bands, but he was constantly rebuffed by the Plymouth leadership who mistrusted all Native Americans, thinking them potential enemies. Eventually, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military commander Major William Bradford (son of the late Governor William Bradford) relented and gave Church permission to organize a combined force of English and Native Americans. After securing the alliance of the Sakonnets, he led his combined force in pursuit of Philip, who had thus far avoided any major battles in the war that bears his name. Throughout July 1676, Church&#x27;s band captured hundreds of Native American warriors, often without much of a fight, though Philip eluded him. Church was given permission to grant amnesty to any captured Native Americans who would agree to join the colonial side, and his force grew immensely. Philip was killed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war soon ended as an overwhelming colonial victory.

Eight percent of the colonial adult male population is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Indigenous population of New England fell by 60 to 80 percent.

=== Final years ===
In 1686, the entire New England region was reorganized under a single government known as the Dominion of New England; this included the colonies of Plymouth, Rhode Island, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. In 1688, New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added. Dominion President Edmund Andros was highly unpopular, and the union did not last. It was dissolved after news reached Boston in April 1689 of the Glorious Revolution, and the citizens of Boston rose up and arrested Andros. When news of these events reached Plymouth, its magistrates reclaimed power.

The return of self-rule for Plymouth Colony was short-lived, however. A delegation of New Englanders led by Increase Mather went to England to negotiate a return of the colonial charters that had been nullified during the Dominion years. The situation was particularly problematic for Plymouth Colony, as it had existed without a formal charter since its founding. Plymouth did not get its wish for a formal charter; instead, a new charter was issued combining Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and other territories including Maine. The official date of the proclamation was October 17, 1691, ending the existence of Plymouth Colony, though it was not put into force until the arrival of the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay on May 14, 1692, carried by the new royal governor Sir William Phips. The last official meeting of the Plymouth General Court occurred on June 8, 1692.

== Life ==
=== Religion ===
John Robinson was the original pastor of the Scrooby congregation and the religious leader of the separatists throughout the Leiden years. He never actually set foot in New England, but many of his theological pronouncements shaped the nature and character of the Plymouth church. For example, Robinson stated that women and men have different social roles but neither was lesser in the eyes of God. He taught that men and women have distinct but complementary roles in church, home, and society as a whole, and he referred to women as the &quot;weaker vessel&quot;, quoting from 1 Peter 3:7. In matters of religious understanding, he proclaimed that it was the man&#x27;s role to &quot;guide and go before&quot; women.

The Pilgrims themselves were separatist Puritans, Protestant Christians who separated from the Church of England. They sought to practice Christianity as was done in the times of the Apostles. Following Martin Luther&#x27;s and John Calvin&#x27;s Reformation, they believed that the Bible was the only true source of religious teaching and that any additions made to Christianity had no place in Christian practice, especially with regard to church traditions such as clerical vestments or the use of Latin in church services. In particular, they were strongly opposed to the Anglicans&#x27; episcopal form of church government. They believed that the church was a community of Christians who made a covenant with God and with one another. Their congregations had a democratic structure. Ministers, teachers, and lay church elders were elected by and responsible to the entire congregation. Each congregation was independent of all the others and directly subject to Christ&#x27;s government, hence the name Congregationalism. The Pilgrims distinguished themselves from another branch of Puritans in that they sought to separate themselves from the Anglican Church, rather than reform it from within. It was this desire to worship from outside of the Anglican Communion that led them first to the Netherlands and ultimately to New England.

Each town in the colony was considered a single church congregation; in later years, some of the larger towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance as a member. This was a more liberal doctrine than the congregations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to conduct detailed interviews with those seeking formal membership. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.

The church was the most important social institution in the colony. The Bible was the primary religious document of the society, and it also served as the primary legal document. Church membership was socially vital. Education was carried out for religious purposes, motivated by a determination to teach the next generation how to read the Bible. The laws of the colony specifically asked parents to provide for the education of their children, &quot;at least to be able duly to read the Scriptures&quot; and to understand &quot;the main Grounds and Principles of Christian Religion&quot;. It was expected that the male head of the household would be responsible for the religious well-being of all its members, children and servants alike.

Most churches used two acts to sanction its members: censure and being &quot;put out&quot;. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior that did not conform with accepted religious and social norms, while being &quot;put out&quot; meant to be removed from church membership. Many social breaches were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment, from fornication to public drunkenness. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social stability.

The Pilgrims practiced infant baptism. The public baptism ceremony was usually performed within six months of birth. Marriage was considered a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one. The Pilgrims saw this arrangement as biblical, there being no evidence from Scripture that a minister should preside over a wedding.

Besides the theology espoused by their religious leaders, the people of Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but there is no evidence that Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first was of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, but it never went to trial. The second was of Mary Ingram in 1677 which resulted in trial and acquittal.

=== Marriage and family life ===
Edward Winslow and Susanna White both lost their spouses during the harsh winter of 1620–1621, and the two became the first couple to be married in Plymouth. Governor Bradford presided over the civil ceremony.

In Plymouth Colony, &quot;courtships were usually initiated by the young people themselves, but as a relationship progressed toward something more permanent, the parents became more directly involved,&quot; according to John Putnam Demos. Parents were concerned with the moral and religious qualities of the proposed spouse, as well as the financial means of each party&#x27;s family. The first step toward marriage was generally a betrothal or pre-contract, a ceremony carried out before two witnesses in which the couple pledged to wed in due time. The couple&#x27;s intentions were published several weeks or months after the betrothal was contracted. &quot;A betrothed couple was considered to have a special status, not married but no longer unmarried either.&quot; Sexual contact was prohibited between a betrothed couple, but the penalty for it was one-fourth of what it was for single persons, and records indicate a relatively high number of babies born less than nine months after a wedding ceremony.

Women in Plymouth Colony had more extensive legal and social rights compared to 17th-century European norms. They were considered equal to men before God from the perspective of the Church. Women were, however, expected to take traditionally feminine roles, such as child-rearing and maintaining the household. Plymouth women enjoyed extensive property and legal rights and could be signatories on contracts. A wife in Plymouth could not be &quot;written out&quot; of her husband&#x27;s will and was guaranteed a full third of the family&#x27;s property upon his death. In some cases, especially in second marriages, women were given exclusive right to retain control of their property separately from their husbands. Women were also known to occasionally sit on juries in Plymouth, a remarkable circumstance in seventeenth century legal practice. Historians James and Patricia Scott Deetz cite a 1678 inquest into the death of Anne Batson&#x27;s child, where the jury was composed of five women and seven men.

Family size in the colony was large by modern American standards, though childbirth was often spaced out, with an average of two years between children. Most families averaged five to six children living under the same roof, though it was not uncommon for one family to have grown children moving out before the mother had finished giving birth. Maternal mortality rates were fairly high; one birth in thirty ended in the death of the mother, resulting in one in five women dying in childbirth. However, &quot;the rate of infant mortality in Plymouth seems to have been relatively low.&quot;

=== Childhood, adolescence, and education ===
Children generally remained in the direct care of their mothers until about the age of 8, after which it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It was assumed that children&#x27;s own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.

Adolescence was not a recognized phase of life in Plymouth colony, and there was no rite of passage which marked transition from youth to adulthood. Several important transitions occurred at various ages, but none marked a single &quot;coming of age&quot; event. Children were expected to begin learning their adult roles in life quite early by taking on some of the family work or by being placed in foster homes to learn a trade. Orphaned children were given the right to choose their own guardians at age 14. At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man&#x27;s mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name an earlier age in his will.

Actual schools were rare in Plymouth colony. The first true school was not founded until 40 years after the foundation of the colony. The General Court first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had received this funding.

Education of the young was never considered to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child&#x27;s parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also played a central role in a child&#x27;s education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.

== Government and laws ==
=== Organization ===

Plymouth Colony did not have a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of governance was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony&#x27;s first governing document, signed by the 41 Puritan men aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony&#x27;s laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.

The colony offered nearly all adult males potential citizenship. Full citizens, or freemen, were accorded full rights and privileges in areas such as voting and holding office. To be considered a freeman, adult males had to be sponsored by an existing freeman and accepted by the General Court. Later restrictions established a one-year waiting period between nominating and granting of freeman status, and also placed religious restrictions on the colony&#x27;s citizens, specifically preventing Quakers from becoming freemen. Freeman status was also restricted by age; the official minimum age was 21, although in practice most men were elevated to freeman status between the ages of 25 and 40, averaging somewhere in their early thirties. The colony established a disabled veterans&#x27; fund in 1636 to support veterans who returned from service with disabilities. In 1641, the Body of Liberties developed protections for people who were unable to perform public service. In 1660, the colonial government restricted voting with a specified property qualification, and they restricted it further in 1671 to only freemen who were &quot;orthodox in the fundamentals of religion&quot;.
The colony&#x27;s most powerful executive was its Governor, who was originally elected by the freemen but was later appointed by the General Court in an annual election. The General Court also elected seven Assistants to form a cabinet to assist the governor. The Governor and Assistants then appointed Constables who served as the chief administrators for the towns, and Messengers who were the main civil servants of the colony. They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, and a host of other duties.

The General Court was the chief legislative and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.

The General Court as the legislative and judicial bodies, and the Governor as the chief executive of the colony constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin&#x27;s political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was a de facto republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact (&quot;self-rule&quot;).

=== Laws ===
As a legislative body, the General Court could make proclamations of law as needed. These laws were not formally compiled anywhere in the early years of the colony; they were first organized and published in the &quot;1636 Book of Laws&quot;. The book was reissued in 1658, 1672, and 1685. These laws included the levying of &quot;rates&quot; or taxes and the distribution of colony lands. The General Court established townships as a means of providing local government over settlements, but reserved for itself the right to control specific distribution of land to individuals within those towns. When new land was granted to a freeman, it was directed that only the person to whom the land was granted was allowed to settle it. It was forbidden for individual settlers to purchase land from Native Americans without formal permission from the General Court. The government recognized the precarious peace that existed with the Wampanoag, and wished to avoid antagonizing them by buying up all of their land.

The laws also set out crimes and their associated punishment. There were several crimes that carried the death penalty: treason, murder, witchcraft, arson, sodomy, rape, bestiality, adultery, and cursing or smiting one&#x27;s parents. The actual exercise of the death penalty was fairly rare; only one sex-related crime resulted in execution, a 1642 incidence of bestiality by Thomas Granger. Edward Bumpus was sentenced to death for &quot;striking and abusing his parents&quot; in 1679, but his sentence was commuted to a severe whipping by reason of insanity. Perhaps the most notable use of the death penalty was in the execution of the Native Americans convicted of the murder of John Sassamon; this helped lead to King Philip&#x27;s War. Though nominally a capital crime, adultery was usually dealt with by public humiliation only. Convicted adulterers were often forced to wear the letters &quot;A.D.&quot; sewn into their garments, much in the manner of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s later novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.

Several laws dealt with indentured servitude, a legal status whereby a person would work off debts or be given training in exchange for a period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.

=== Official seal ===
The seal of the Plymouth Colony was designed in 1629 and is still used by the town of Plymouth. It depicts four figures within a shield bearing St George&#x27;s Cross, each carrying the burning heart symbol of John Calvin. The seal was also used by the County of Plymouth until 1931.

== Geography ==
=== Boundaries ===

Without a clear land patent for the area, the settlers settled without a charter to form a government and, as a result, it was often unclear in the early years what land was under the colony&#x27;s jurisdiction. In 1644, &quot;The Old Colony Line&quot;—which had been surveyed in 1639—was formally accepted as the boundary between Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth.

The situation was more complicated along the border with Rhode Island. Roger Williams settled in the area of Rehoboth in 1636, near modern Pawtucket. He was forcibly evicted in order to maintain Plymouth&#x27;s claim to the area. Williams moved to the west side of the Pawtucket River to found the settlement of Providence, the nucleus for the colony of Rhode Island, which was formally established with the &quot;Providence Plantations Patent&quot; of 1644. Various settlers from both Rhode Island and Plymouth began to settle along the area, and the exact nature of the western boundary of Plymouth became unclear. The issue was not fully resolved until the 1740s, long after the dissolution of Plymouth Colony itself. Rhode Island had received a patent for the area in 1693, which had been disputed by Massachusetts Bay Colony. Rhode Island successfully defended the patent, and a royal decree in 1746 confirmed Rhode Island&#x27;s territory along the eastern shore of the Narragansett Bay, including the mainland portion of Newport County and all of modern Bristol County, Rhode Island. The border itself continued to be contested by Massachusetts, first as a colony and later as a state, until as late as 1898, when the boundary was settled and ratified by both states.

=== Counties and towns ===

For most of its history, the town was the primary administrative unit and political division of the colony. Plymouth Colony was not formally divided into counties until June 2, 1685, during the reorganization that led to the formation of the Dominion of New England. Three counties were composed of the following towns.

Barnstable County on Cape Cod:

* Barnstable, the shire town (county seat) of the county, first settled in 1639 and incorporated 1650.
* Eastham, site of the &quot;First Encounter&quot;, first settled 1644 and incorporated as the town of Nauset in 1646, name changed to Eastham in 1651.
* Falmouth, first settled in 1661 and incorporated as Succonesset in 1686.
* Rochester, settled 1638, incorporated 1686.
* Sandwich, first settled in 1637 and incorporated in 1639.
* Yarmouth, Originally named &quot;Mattacheese&quot; by the native Americans, it was named for a seaport at the mouth of the Yar river in England and incorporated in 1639.
Bristol County along the shores of Buzzards Bay and Narragansett Bay; part of this county was later ceded to Rhode Island:
* Taunton, the shire town of the county, incorporated 1639 and grew due to the early discovery of bog iron.
* Bristol, incorporated 1680 and including the former locations of Sowams and Montaup (Mount Hope), which were Massasoit&#x27;s and King Philip&#x27;s capitals, respectively. Ceded to Rhode Island in 1746 and is now part of Bristol County, Rhode Island.
* Dartmouth, incorporated 1664. Dartmouth was the site of a significant massacre by the Indian forces during King Philip&#x27;s War. It was also the location of a surrender of a group of some 160 of Philip&#x27;s forces who were later sold into slavery.
* Freetown, Originally known as &quot;Assonet&quot; to the natives, and &quot;Freemen&#x27;s Land&quot; by its first settlers. Settlement records are lost however it was incorporated under its current name in July 1683.
* Little Compton, incorporated as Sakonnet in 1682, ceded to Rhode Island in 1746 and is now part of Newport County, Rhode Island.
* Rehoboth, first settled 1644 and incorporated 1645. Nearby to, but distinct from the Rehoboth settlement of Roger Williams, which is now the town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
* Swansea, founded as the township of Wannamoiset in 1667, incorporated as town of Swansea in 1668. It was here that the first English casualty occurred in King Philip&#x27;s War.

Plymouth County, located along the western shores of Cape Cod Bay:
* Plymouth, the shire town of the county and capital of the colony. This was the original 1620 settlement of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims, and continued as the largest and most significant settlement in the colony until its dissolution in 1691.
* Bridgewater, purchased from Massasoit by Myles Standish, and originally named Duxburrow New Plantation, it was incorporated as Bridgewater in 1656.
* Duxbury, founded by Myles Standish, it was incorporated in 1637. Other notable residents of Duxbury included John Alden, William Brewster, and Governor Thomas Prence.
* Marshfield, settled 1632, incorporated 1640. Home to Governor Edward Winslow. Also home to Josiah Winslow, who was governor of the colony during King Philip&#x27;s War, and to Peregrine White, the first English child born in New England.
* Middleborough, incorporated 1669 as Middleberry. Named for its location as the halfway point on the journey from Plymouth to Mount Hope, the Wampanoag capital.
* Scituate, settled 1628 and incorporated 1636. The town was the site of a major attack by King Philip&#x27;s forces in 1676.

== Demographics ==

=== English ===
The settlers of Plymouth Colony fit broadly into three categories: &quot;Pilgrims&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Particulars&quot;. The Pilgrims were a Puritan group who closely followed the teachings of John Calvin, like the later founders of Massachusetts Bay Colony to the north. (The difference was that the Massachusetts Bay Puritans hoped to reform the Anglican church from within, whereas the Pilgrims saw it as a morally defunct organization and removed themselves from it.) The name &quot;Pilgrims&quot; was actually not used by the settlers themselves. William Bradford used the term to describe the group, but he was using it generically to define them as travelers on a religious mission. The Pilgrims referred to themselves as the &quot;Saints&quot;, &quot;First Comers&quot;, &quot;Ancient Brethren&quot;, or &quot;Ancient Men&quot;. They used such terms to indicate their place as God&#x27;s elect, as they subscribed to the Calvinist belief in predestination. &quot;The First Comers&quot; was a term more loosely used in their day to refer to any of the Mayflower passengers. There were also a number of indentured servants among the colonists. Indentured servants were mostly poor children whose families were receiving church relief and &quot;homeless waifs from the streets of London sent as laborers&quot;.

In addition to the Pilgrims, the &quot;Mayflower&quot; carried &quot;Strangers&quot;, the non-Puritan settlers placed on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; by the Merchant Adventurers who provided various skills needed to establish a colony. This also included later settlers who came for other reasons throughout the history of the colony and who did not adhere to the Pilgrim religious ideals. A third group known as the &quot;Particulars&quot; consisted of later settlers who paid their own &quot;particular&quot; way to America, and thus were not obligated to pay the colony&#x27;s debts.

The presence of outsiders such as the Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained by their lack of discipline, both emotionally and in terms of resources. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people. The residents of Plymouth also used terms to distinguish between the earliest settlers of the colony and those who came later. The first generation of settlers called themselves the &quot;Old Comers&quot; or &quot;Planters&quot;, those who arrived before 1627. Later generations of Plymouth residents referred to this group as the &quot;Forefathers&quot;.

Historian John Demos did a demographic study in &quot;A Little Commonwealth&quot; (1970). He reports that the colony&#x27;s average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived until age 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. The numbers were much lower for women owing to the difficulties of childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was 62.4 years. Of these women, fewer than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.

During King Philip&#x27;s War, Plymouth Colony lost eight percent of its adult male population. By the end of the war, one-third of New England&#x27;s approximately 100 towns had been burned and abandoned, and this had a significant demographic effect on the population of New England.

=== Native Americans ===
The Native Americans in New England were organized into loose tribal confederations, sometimes referred to as nations. Among these confederations were the Nipmucks, the Massachusetts, the Narragansetts, the Niantics, the Mohegans, and the Wampanoags. Several significant events dramatically altered the demographics of the Indigenous population in the region. The first was &quot;Standish&#x27;s raid&quot; on Wessagussett, which frightened Indigenous leaders to the extent that many abandoned their settlements, resulting in many deaths through starvation and disease. The second was the Pequot War, which resulted in the dissolution of the Pequot tribe and a major shift in the local power structure. The third was King Philip&#x27;s War which had the most dramatic effect on local populations, resulting in the death or displacement of as much as 80 percent of the total number of southern New England Natives and the enslavement and forced displacement of thousands to the Caribbean and other locales.

=== Black and Indigenous slaves ===

Some of the wealthier families in Plymouth Colony enslaved Black people and Native Americans. Colonists considered slaves to be the property of their owners, able to be passed on to heirs, unlike indentured servants. Slave ownership was not widespread and very few families possessed the wealth necessary to acquire slaves. In 1674, the inventory of Capt. Thomas Willet of Marshfield includes &quot;8 Negroes&quot; at a value of £200. In the July 29, 1680, codicil to the will of Peter Worden of Yarmouth, he bequeathed ownership of his &quot;Indian servant&quot; to his wife Mary, to be passed on to their son Samuel upon her decease. The unnamed slave was dutifully recorded in the January 21, 1681, inventory of Worden&#x27;s estate at the original purchase price of £4 10s. Other inventories of the time valued &quot;Negro&quot; slaves at £24–25 each (equivalent to £ in 2010, or $ at PPP), well out of the financial ability of most families. A 1689 census of the town of Bristol shows that, of the 70 families that lived there, only one owned a Black slave. So few were Black and Indigenous slaves in the colony that the General Court never saw fit to pass any laws dealing with them.

== Economy ==
The largest source of wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The disruption of this trade caused by Myles Standish&#x27;s raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists for many years and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.

The economic situation improved with the arrival of cattle in the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at parity). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove down the price of cattle. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at parity). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.

Agriculture also made up an important part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Indian agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, and beans. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Indians, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.

Overall, there was very little cash in Plymouth Colony, so most wealth was accumulated in the form of possessions. Trade goods such as furs, fish, and livestock were subject to fluctuations in price and were unreliable repositories of wealth. Durable goods represented an important source of economic stability for the residents, such as fine wares, clothes, and furnishings. In 1652, the Massachusetts General Court authorized Boston silversmith John Hull to produce local coinage in shilling, sixpence, and threepence denominations to address a coin shortage in the colony. To that point, the colony&#x27;s economy had been entirely dependent on barter and foreign currency, including English, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and counterfeit coins. In 1661, after the restoration of the monarchy, the English government considered the Boston mint to be treasonous. However, the colony ignored the English demands to cease operations until at least 1682, when Hull&#x27;s contract expired, and the colony did not move to renew his contract or appoint a new mint master. The coinage was a contributing factor to the revocation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter in 1684.

== Legacy ==
The events surrounding the founding and history of Plymouth Colony have had a lasting effect on the art, traditions, mythology, and politics of the United States of America, despite the colony&#x27;s short existence of less than 72 years.

=== Art, literature, and film ===

The earliest artistic depiction of the Pilgrims was actually done before their arrival in America; Dutch painter Adam Willaerts painted a portrait of their departure from Delfshaven in 1620. The same scene was repainted by Robert Walter Weir in 1844, and hangs in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol building. Numerous other paintings have been created memorializing various scenes from the life of Plymouth Colony, including their landing and the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot;, many of which have been collected by Pilgrim Hall, a museum and historical society founded in 1824 to preserve the history of the Colony.
Several contemporaneous accounts of life in Plymouth Colony have become both vital primary historical documents and literary classics. &quot;Of Plimoth Plantation&quot; (1630 and 1651) by William Bradford and &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; (1622) by Bradford, Edward Winslow, and others are both accounts written by &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers that provide much of the information which we have today regarding the trans-Atlantic voyage and early years of the settlement.

Benjamin Church wrote several accounts of King Philip&#x27;s War, including &quot;Entertaining Passages Relating to Philip&#x27;s War&quot;, which remained popular throughout the 18th century. An edition of the work was illustrated by Paul Revere in 1772. &quot;The Sovereignty and Goodness of God&quot; provides an account of King Philip&#x27;s War from the perspective of Mary Rowlandson, an Englishwoman who was captured and held by Philip&#x27;s tribe during the war. Later works have provided a romantic and partially fictionalized account of life in Plymouth Colony, such as &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

There are also numerous films about the Pilgrims, including the several film adaptations of &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;; the 1952 film &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; starring Spencer Tracy; and &quot;Desperate Crossings: The True Story of the Mayflower&quot;, a 2006 television documentary produced by the History Channel.

=== Thanksgiving ===
Each year, the United States celebrates the holiday of Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. It is a federal holiday and frequently involves a family gathering with a large feast, traditionally featuring a turkey. Civic recognitions of the holiday typically include parades and football games. The holiday is meant to honor the First Thanksgiving, which was a feast of thanksgiving held in Plymouth in 1621, as first recorded in the book &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; by William Bradford, one of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; pilgrims and the colony&#x27;s second governor.

The annual Thanksgiving holiday is a more recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. government had declared a particular day as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly after the end of the War of 1812. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Boston&#x27;s &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;, wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of this annual day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim&#x27;s first feast. After nearly 40 years, Abraham Lincoln declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Congress ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some sparring as to the date, the holiday was recognized by Congress as an official federal holiday in 1941.

=== Plymouth Rock ===
One of the enduring symbols of the landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large granodiorite boulder that was near their landing site at Plymouth. However, none of the contemporaneous accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing, not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that was a source of fresh water and fish.

The first identification of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father had arrived in Plymouth in 1623, three years after the &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate it, but it broke in two. The severed piece was placed in the Town Square at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken piece was reattached to it. Over the years, souvenir hunters have removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of living history museums. These include the &quot;Mayflower II&quot;, a recreation of the original ship; Plimoth Patuxet (formerly called &quot;Plimoth Plantation&quot;), a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.

=== Political legacy ===
The democratic setup of Plymouth Colony had a strong influence on shaping democracy in both England and America. William Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Of Plimoth Plantation&quot; was widely read in England. It influenced the political thought of Puritan politician and poet John Milton, assistant to Oliver Cromwell, and philosopher John Locke. For example, Locke referred to the Mayflower Compact in his &quot;Letters Concerning Toleration&quot;. In America, Plymouth Colony initiated a democratic tradition that was followed by Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628), Connecticut Colony (1636), the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1636), the Province of New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1681). Roger Williams established Providence Plantations specifically as a safe haven for those who experienced religious persecution, thereby adding freedom of conscience to Plymouth&#x27;s democratic model.

=== The Mayflower Society ===

The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, or The Mayflower Society, is a genealogical organization of individuals who have documented their descent from one or more of the 102 passengers who arrived on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. The Society was founded at Plymouth in 1897 and claims that tens of millions of Americans are descended from these passengers, and it offers research services for people seeking to document their descent.

<doc id="218111" wikidata="Q907903" url="?curid=218111" title="White-necked raven">
<text>The white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis) is a species of raven native to eastern and southern Africa. It is somewhat smaller (50–54 cm in length) than the common raven or its nearest relative, the thick-billed raven &quot;C. crassirostris&quot;.

==Description==

The white-necked raven has a much shorter tail than the common raven, as well as a deeper bill with a white tip that is almost as strongly arched as that of the thick-billed raven. Though predominantly black, the throat, breast and neck show a faint purple gloss. There is a large patch of white feathers on the nape of the neck.

Soars well with shallower wingbeats than other Corvidae.

===Measurements===

* Length: 50 – 54 cm
* Wingspan: 752 – 860 mm (17 unsexed birds)
* Weight: 762 - 865 g

===Vocalisation===
Often described as a raven with a sore throat, it has very similar calls to the common raven, but with a more husky note. It has a croak like the other raven species but with a more whispering note. Like all corvids, the White-necked raven is capable of vocal mimicry. However, this behavior is only ever recorded in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==

It occurs in eastern and southern Africa in open, mountainous country. It is quite commonly found in small towns and villages as long as there are mountains or hills for roosting and nesting relatively nearby.

The species is associated with mountains, as the species nests on cliff ledges. As such its often found in montane grasslands.

==Behaviour==

The species is omnivorous, feeding on both vegetable and animal matter.

Most of this bird&#x27;s food is obtained from the ground, but it will take food from trees as well. It has been seen to drop a tortoise from a height on to hard ground, preferably on rocks, and then swoop down to eat it, or even pick it up again if not sufficiently broken. White-necked ravens will also readily take carrion from road kills. Fruit, grain, insects, small reptiles, peanuts and human food are also readily taken, and the bird forages in back yards and gardens quite openly. Like all or most raven species, White-necked ravens form flocks after leaving their parents and, once fully matured, will pair off and form territories. They are often found in the company of other scavengers such as kites or vultures.

Nests are bowls of sticks lined with grass, hair, and wool, built mainly on cliff ledges but occasionally found in trees. There are usually 3-5 eggs laid.

<text>St. Hanshaugen (Norwegian for St. John&#x27;s Hill) is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway.

==Area==

It has a triangular shape, with its northern border just north of the buildings of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and Ullevål University Hospital, and south of the University of Oslo campus at Blindern. In the east, the boundary runs just west of the river Akerselva, then down Storgata before it turns north, up Grensen, Pilestredet and Suhms gate.

The borough has its name from St. Hanshaugen Park that lies centrally within it, where the citizens used to celebrate summer solstice (&quot;St. Hans&quot; in Norwegian). The park was planted by the city in the years 1876–86; it has a pavilion, and a reflecting pool covering a reservoir. The neighbourhood St. Hanshaugen is located west and south of the park, with shopping, eating and public transport where the streets Ullevålsveien and Waldemar Thranes gate meets. There is also the traditional restaurant Schrøder, known for one of its regulars, Jo Nesbø&#x27;s fictional figure Harry Hole.

To the southeast of the park is Oslo&#x27;s oldest building – Aker Kirke, built around 1100, but restored from ruins around 1860, and then again in the 1950s in a more authentic style. Next to the church is the cemetery Vår Frelsers gravlund, created in 1808 as a result of the great famine and cholera epidemic of the Napoleonic Wars. The nearby area around Damstredet and Telthusbakken is interesting since it retains the small town character of Oslo in the first part of the 19th century.

To the southwest of the park is Bislett stadion, founded in 1907. Finished in 1940, this was the main venue of the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The stadium was demolished in 2004, and a new stadion was built in its place.

The borough also contains the cemeteries Nordre Gravlund and Vestre Aker, and Youngstorget – home of the Norwegian labour movement.

==Park==
St. Hanshaugen is one of Oslo&#x27;s largest parks, just north of the city centre. This popular recreational area is great for walks, and from the top of the hill you have a nice view of Oslo.

St. Hanshaugen was originally a bare rock hill. In the 1840s the name St. Hanshaugen (&quot;midsummer hill&quot;) came into use, as the hill was a popular place for midsummer celebrations. In 1855 it was decided that parts of the hill was to be planted, and a big part of the hill was turned into a park in the next 30 years. The park also got a park keeper house, an artificial creek and a pavilion on the square Festplassen, and the park was expanded. Through the years, a number of statues were also placed in the park. In 1936, the park got an open-air café on Festplassen – the square on top of the hill – which is still a popular summer café today.

==Demographics==
January 1, 2020, there were 38,945 people living in the borough. Of the population in 2004 13,093 (49%) were male. There were 1,918 immigrants from western countries and 2,488 from non-western countries. The countries with most immigrants were Sweden (789), Denmark (272), Pakistan (191), Somalia (188) and Vietnam (182). There were 537 births in 2003, and 260 deaths. The same year 8,139 people moved into the borough, while 8,101 moved out. The average income for the borough was NOK 262,534, somewhat higher than the average for the city of 254,429.

In 2001, 59.4% of those over 20 years old in private households were living alone (national average 37.5%). Of the remainder, 15.7% were cohabitants and 24.9% married (national average 12.2% and 50.2% respectively).

==Politics==
In the municipal election of 2007 all borough councils became elective, until then most had been appointed by the city council. Labour and the Conservatives each gained 4 seats, the Socialist Left have 3, the Liberals 2, the Progress Party and the Red Electoral Alliance 1 each.

The municipal election of 2011 changed the composition of the council. The Conservative Party became the biggest, winning 5 seats, while Labour kept its 4, the Liberal Party its 2, and the Red Party its 1 seat. The Socialist Left and the Progress Party lost one seat each, ending at 2 and 0, respectively. The Green Party won its first St. Hanshaugen-seat. This result allowed Torunn Kanutte Husvik of the Labour Party to continue as leader of the borough council.

In the 2015 municipal election, the Conservative Party and Labour won 4 seats each, though the former remained the largest party in terms of votes. The Green Party had a breakthrough election, winning 3 seats, while the Liberal Party retained its 2 seats and the Socialist Left and the Red Party won 1 seat each. After the election, the Conservatives, the Greens and the Liberals signed a cooperation agreement, making Anne Christine Kroepelien of the Conservative Party the new leader of the borough council.

<text>The Enabling Act of 1933 (German: &quot;&quot;), officially titled (), was a law that gave the German Cabinet – most importantly, the Chancellor – the power to make and enforce laws without the involvement of the Reichstag or President Paul von Hindenburg. By allowing the Chancellor to override the checks and balances in the constitution, the Enabling Act marked the beginning of the transition from the democratic Weimar Republic to the totalitarian dictatorship of Nazi Germany.

==Background==
On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), was appointed as Chancellor, the head of the German government. Hitler immediately asked President von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag. A general election was scheduled for 5 March 1933.

=== Reichstag fire ===
On 27 February, the Reichstag building of the German parliament caught fire. Acting as chancellor, Hitler immediately accused the Communists of perpetrating the arson as part of a larger effort to overthrow the German government. He persuaded Hindenburg to enact the Reichstag Fire Decree, which abolished most civil liberties, including the right to speak, assemble and protest, and the right to due process. A state of emergency was declared on the basis of the decree, which enabled a violent crackdown against the Nazis&#x27; political enemies, in particular the Communist Party. 

Amid the ongoing repression, Hitler contended that the Reichstag Fire Decree was nonetheless insufficient and demanded a more sweeping measure. He submitted to the Reichstag a proposal for an enabling law that that would grant effectively untrammeled power to his cabinet.

=== March 1933 election ===
For the general election of 5 March 1933, the Nazis were allied with other nationalist and conservative factions. At a secret meeting on 20 February, major German industrialists had agreed to finance the Nazis&#x27; election campaign. The main residual opposition was the Social Democrats. On election day Germans voted in an atmosphere of extreme voter intimidation, perpetrated mainly by the Nazi (SA) militia.

The NSDAP emerged from the election with five million more votes than in the previous election, but failed to gain an absolute majority in parliament. It remained dependent on the 8% of seats won by its coalition partner, the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), to attain a 52% majority. 

In the first post-election cabinet meeting on 15 March, Hitler declared his intention to pass an Enabling Act along the lines of the one previously proposed, in order to give the NSDAP complete freedom of action.

== Preparations and negotiations ==
The Enabling Act would allow the National Ministry (essentially the cabinet) to enact legislation, including laws deviating from or altering the constitution, without the consent of the Reichstag, for a period of four years. The law was thus itself considered a constitutional amendment. It therefore required a two-thirds super-majority support from a quorum of at least two-thirds of all members of the Reichstag.

Despite the elimination of the Communists and heavy pressure on the rest of the opposition, the bill&#x27;s passage was not a certainty. To pass it, the Nazis used a strategy of coercion, bribery, and manipulation of parliamentarians.

The Social Democrats and the Communists were expected to vote against. The government had already arrested all Communist and some Social Democrat deputies under the Reichstag Fire Decree. The conservative parties representing the middle class, the Junkers and business interests were expected to vote for the law.

A two-thirds majority would therefore be in reach with the votes of the Catholic Centre Party. Hitler negotiated with the Centre Party&#x27;s chairman, Ludwig Kaas, a Catholic priest, and finalized an agreement on 22 March. Kaas agreed to support the law in exchange for assurances of his party&#x27;s continued existence, the protection of Catholic civil liberties and Catholic schools, and the retention of civil servants affiliated with the party.

Some historians, such as Klaus Scholder, have maintained that Hitler also promised to negotiate a &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; with the Holy See, a treaty that formalized the position of the Catholic Church in Germany on a national level. Kaas was a close associate of Cardinal Pacelli, then Vatican Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII). Pacelli had been pursuing a German concordat as a key policy for some years, but the instability of Weimar governments, as well as the opposition of some parties to a treaty, had blocked the project. The day after the Enabling Act vote, Kaas went to Rome in order to, in his own words, &quot;investigate the possibilities for a comprehensive understanding between church and state&quot;. No evidence has surfaced for a link between the Enabling Act and the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; signed on 20 July 1933.

==Text==
As with most of the laws passed in the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, the Enabling Act is quite short, especially considering its implications. The full text, in German and English, follows:

Articles 1 and 4 gave the government the right to draw up the budget, approve treaties, and enact any laws whatsoever without input from the Reichstag. By the rules of pre-1933 German legal interpretation, and post-1945 if such a law were not now unconstitutional, this would mean that such laws would henceforth be decided by a majority vote in the Cabinet. This was not followed.

In the years immediately preceding, the government had relied on Article 48 emergency decrees. These had to be made by the President, alongside ordinary laws which he simple enacted. In the passing of Enabling-Act-based laws, the President had no role to play at all. Until Hitler effectively assumed the President&#x27;s role in 1934, laws were passed without any contribution by the head of state. This was a situation unique in German history.

==Passage==


Debate within the Centre Party continued until the day of the vote, 23 March 1933. Ludwig Kaas advocated voting in favour of the act, touting promised written guarantees from Hitler. Former Chancellor Heinrich Brüning wanted the bill to be rejected. The majority sided with Kaas, and Brüning agreed to maintain party cohesion by voting for the law.

The Reichstag, led by its president, Hermann Göring, changed its rules of procedure to make it easier to pass the bill. Under the Weimar Constitution, a quorum of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag membership was required to be present in order to pass a law amending the constitution. To sidestep this potential obstruction, Göring declared that any deputy who was &quot;absent without excuse&quot; was to be considered as present. In this case, 432 of the Reichstag&#x27;s 647 deputies would normally be required present. Göring reduced this figure to 378 by not counting the 81 KPD deputies.

Despite their virulent anti-Communist rhetoric, the Nazis had not formally banned the KPD. They still feared a violent uprising, and also hoped the KPD&#x27;s presence on the ballot would siphon off votes from the SPD. However, since the election of 6 March, the party was subject to virulent police repression on the grounds of its purported involvement in the Reichstag fire. It was therefore widely understood that the KPD deputies would not be allowed to take their seats in parliament.

Provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree were used to detain and thus neutralize several SPD deputies. A number of other SPD parliamentarians had fled into exile.

Late on 23 March, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House, its temporary home since the Reichstag fire. SA men were positioned inside and outside the chamber. 

Hitler gave a speech which emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture. This was aimed at the Centre Party and incorporated Kaas&#x27;s requested guarantees almost verbatim. Brüning remained silent, but Kaas spoke to voice his party&#x27;s support for the bill amid &quot;concerns put aside&quot;. He had still not received the written guarantee he had negotiated but was assured it was being &quot;typed up&quot;. Kaas never received it.

Only SPD leader Otto Wels spoke against the Enabling Act. He declared that the proposed bill could not &quot;destroy ideas which are eternal and indestructible&quot;.

As voting proceeded, SPD deputies were actively intimidated by the Nazi SA men, who were present throughout the proceedings.

=== Voting results ===
All parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act. With the KPD banned and 26 SPD deputies arrested or in hiding, the final tally was 444 in favour of the Enabling Act against 94 opposed (all Social Democrats). The Reichstag adopted the bill with the support of 83% of the deputies present. Even if all SPD deputies had been present, it would have passed with 78.7% support.

In the evening of the same day, the Reichsrat gave its assent, unanimously and without prior debate, and the Enabling Act was signed into law by President Paul von Hindenburg. Unless extended by the Reichstag, the act would expire after four years.

==Consequences==
The Enabling Act completed the effect of the Reichstag Fire Decree. It transformed Hitler&#x27;s government into a legal dictatorship and laid the groundwork for his totalitarian regime. Thus empowered, Hitler could begin German rearmament and achieve his aggressive foreign policy aims, which ultimately resulted in World War II.

The Reichstag effectively became the rubber stamp parliament that Hitler sought. The German conservative elite, including the vice-chancellor Franz von Papen, having underestimated the determination of the Nazis to monopolize state power, were soon marginalized by the Nazi regime. By mid-March 1933, the government began sending communists, trade union leaders, and other political dissidents to Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp.

On 14 July 1933, a law made the Nazi Party the only legally permitted party in Germany. With that, Hitler fulfilled what he had promised in earlier campaign speeches: &quot;I set for myself one aim ... to sweep these thirty parties out of Germany!&quot;

== Legal fate ==
The Weimar Constitution of 1919, as amended by the Enabling Act, remained technically in effect.

=== Consultation and deliberation ===
During the negotiations between the government and the political parties, it had been agreed that the government should inform the Reichstag parties of laws passed under the Enabling Act. For that purpose, a working committee was set up, co-chaired by Hitler and Centre Party chairman Kaas. However, the committee met only three times, without any major impact, and had become a dead letter even before all other parties were banned.

Although the Act had formally given legislative powers to the government as a whole, those powers were, for all intents and purposes, exercised by Hitler himself. After the passage of the Act, there were no longer serious deliberations in Cabinet meetings. After 1934, its meetings became more and more infrequent, and it did not meet in full after 1938.

=== Possible violations ===

The &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; (30 January 1934) dissolved the state parliaments, effectively rendering irrelevant the Reichsrat, which represented the states. Two weeks later (14 February) the Reichsrat itself was abolished. Both laws contradicted Article 2 of the Enabling Act, which stated that laws passed under the Enabling Act must &quot;not affect&quot; the Reichsrat.

In August 1934, President Hindenburg died, and Hitler seized the president&#x27;s powers for himself in accordance with the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich, passed the previous day. The move was confirmed by a referendum later that month. But Article 2 of the Enabling Act stated that the president&#x27;s powers were to remain &quot;undisturbed&quot; (or &quot;unaffected&quot;, depending on the translation). Furthermore, a 1932 amendment to the constitution had made the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, first in the line of succession to the presidency—and even then on an interim basis pending new elections. This ostensible violation of Article 2 was never challenged in court.

===Renewals===
The Enabling Act was renewed twice, first in 1937 and then in 1941. Its renewal was practically assured because all other parties were banned. Voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and Nazi-approved candidates under far-from-secret conditions.

In 1942, the Reichstag passed a law giving Hitler power of life and death over every citizen, effectively extending the provisions of the Enabling Act for the duration of the war.

=== In the Federal Republic of Germany ===
The Enabling Act was formally declared to be repealed by the Allied Control Council in Control Council Law No. 1, following the surrender of Germany at the end of World War II.

Germany&#x27;s Basic Law (constitution) of 1949 stipulates that only bodies that are constitutionally endowed with legislative power can enact laws. This theoretically precludes legislation such as the 1933 Enabling Act.

Article 9 of the 1949 constitution allows for social groups to be labeled &quot;&quot; (&quot;hostile to the constitution&quot;) and to be proscribed by the federal government. Political parties can be labeled enemies to the constitution only by the (Federal Constitutional Court) according to Art. 21 II. This clause makes clear that even a popular majority cannot be allowed to install a totalitarian or autocratic regime such as with the Enabling Act of 1933, which would violate the principles of the German constitution.

==Validity==

In his 2003 book, &quot;The Coming of the Third Reich&quot;, British historian Richard J. Evans argued that the Enabling Act was legally invalid. He contended that Göring had no right to arbitrarily reduce the quorum required to bring the bill up for a vote. While the Enabling Act only required the support of two-thirds of those present and voting, two-thirds of the entire Reichstag&#x27;s membership had to be present in order for the legislature to consider a constitutional amendment.

According to Evans, while Göring was not required to count the KPD deputies in order to get the Enabling Act passed, he was required to &quot;recognize their existence&quot; by counting them for purposes of the quorum needed to call it up, making his refusal to do so &quot;an illegal act&quot;. Even if the Communists had been present and voting, the session&#x27;s atmosphere was so intimidating that the Act would have still passed with at least 68.7% support.

He also argued that the act&#x27;s passage in the Reichsrat was tainted by the overthrow of the state governments under the Reichstag Fire Decree; as Evans put it, the states were no longer &quot;properly constituted or represented&quot;, making the Enabling Act&#x27;s passage in the Reichsrat &quot;irregular&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The 2003 film &quot;&quot; contains a scene portraying the passage of the Enabling Act.

<text>Sagene is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway. The area became part of the city of Oslo (then Christiania) in 1859. The name Sagene itself is the plural of the Norwegian word for &quot;saw&quot;, reflecting all the old industrial mechanical saws powered by the river Akerselva in this area in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Area==
The borough of Sagene includes the neighborhoods of Sagene, Bjølsen, Iladalen (Ila), Sandaker, Åsen, and Torshov. It is the smallest borough of Oslo, but compared to its relatively small size, it has a noteworthy population by Norwegian standards. In the west its border is the street Uelandsgate and the cemetery (&quot;gravlund&quot;) Nordre gravlund. In the north it borders Tåsen and Storo. The border then follows the valley Torshovdalen in the east, and borders the areas of Rodeløkka and Grünerløkka is the south.


Running through the borough of Sagene is the river Akerselva which has contributed in shaping the culture and history of the borough. The
river has been exploited for energy, and along it for a thousand years, mills and turbines have been operating.
The main street is called Vogts Street. and it&#x27;s in Torshov. The tram goes down this street, which is the most busy street in the Sagene/Torshov borough. The street is highly urbanised with plenty of stores and coffee shops. Vogts gate is in the heart of Torshov.
==History==

Norway&#x27;s oldest industrial building - Glads Mølle papermill - is located in Sagene. The cradle of industrialism in Norway stood here in the
mid-19th century with establishments such as Graahs Spinneri and Hjula Væveri. Author Oskar Braaten (1881–1939) grew up and got
inspiration for his books in this environment. Today the old factories are filled by modern industries, in large parts with media, information technology (IT) and graphical businesses. Small wooden houses along the streets Maridalsveien and Sandakerveien are memories of the incoming dwellings of the 18th century, while the laborers&#x27; housing of the 19th century was built in concrete.

Sagene Church (&quot;Sagene Kirke&quot;) was designed by architect Christian Furst. It was opened in 1891 and is monumental for the area. 
The church was built in Neo-Gothic style revival style and it was consecrated in 1891. The altarpiece is a copy of the one in the cathedral in Antwerp. The altarpiece was executed by the painter Christen Brun (1828-1905) and shows the removal of Jesus from the cross.

After the World War I the area around Torshov (now part of the borough of Sagene) and Sagene was planned to be a &quot;city within the city&quot;
with some 2,000 apartments. This can still be experienced in Torshov today. The esteemed Soria Moria building from 1928 houses theatre,
cinemas, restaurants and other cultural events and offerings.
In 2003 Sagene was one of the four boroughs in Oslo with direct elections to the boroughs council, the rest being appointed by the city council. During the period 2003-2007 the leader of the borough council was Tone Tellevik Dahl from the Labour party, with her deputy being Jan Fredrik Pedersen from the Socialist Left Party. The borough council consisted of 5 representatives for the Socialist Left, 4 for Labour, 2 each for Conservatives and Progress and 1 each for the Red Electoral Alliance and the Liberals. In the 2007 borough election Labour became the largest party, with 5 representatives, the Socialist Left and the Conservatives both getting 3 seats, the Liberals 2 and Progress and the Red Electoral Alliance 1 each.

==Parks==
*Bjølsenparken is 34 acres and known for a beautiful linden tree-lined street which runs north-south along the park&#x27;s highest point.
*Iladalen Park is in the borough of Iladalen. The 27.9 acre park was established in 1948. 
==Sports==
Skeid is traditionally a Torshov team with a good reputation of producing successful talents to Norwegian football.

==Sagene Depot==
Sagene Depot (Norwegian: Sagene vognhall) is a repurposed tram depot in Stockfleths gate at Sagene in Oslo, Norway. Two hall units, several apartments and offices, a forge and a workshop constitute the depot. The two hall units are preserved, and are now used as a cultural meeting place.

In 1902, three years after the Sagene Line had opened, Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie built one hall unit for the tramway.[1] An additional hall unit was later constructed.

<text>Grünerløkka () is a borough but also a neighborhood of the city of Oslo, Norway. Grünerløkka became part of the city of Oslo (then Christiania) in 1858. Grünerløkka was traditionally a working class district; since the late 20th century the area has increasingly undergone gentrification. Especially in the core neighborhood of Grünerløkka, property prices tend to be higher than is typical of other Oslo East End boroughs.

The borough consists of the following neighborhoods:

* Grünerløkka vest (West)
* Grünerløkka øst (East)
* Dælenenga
* Rodeløkka
* Sinsen
* Sofienberg
* Hasle
In the Oslo borough reform on 1 January 2004, the borough Helsfyr-Sinsen was removed, and the neighborhoods Sinsen, Løren, Lille Tøyen and Hasle were included in Grünerløkka.

==Etymology==
The first element was derived from the surname &quot;Grüner&quot;. The last element is the definite form of &quot;løkke&quot;, meaning &quot;paddock&quot;.

Grünerløkka was named after Friedrich Grüner (1628-1674) who served as chief administrator (&quot;Oberhauptmann&quot;) and the master of the mint (&quot;myntmester&quot;) at Christiania from 1651 until his death in 1674. Grüner purchased the Kings Mill (&quot;Kongens mølle&quot;) and surrounding acreage in the area from King Christian V of Denmark in 1672.

==History==
Thorvald Meyer (1818–1909) bought parts of the Grünerløkka area in 1861. The industrialist built the main street of the neighborhood Grünerløkka, now named Thorvald Meyers gate. During the 19th century, Grünerløkka became a working-class area. Several factories were placed here because of the advantages of being located close to the Akerselva River. Christiania Seildugsfabrikk from 1856 and Aktieselskapet Herkules from 1898 were two of the factories established.

Grünerløkka is located with the parish of Paulus Church (&quot;Paulus kirke&quot;). In 1866, Paulus parish had a total population of 13,600. By 1900, the parish population had risen to 22,000. At that time, only five streets in Oslo had a population above 3000. Of these, three were located in Grünerløkka: Markveien, Thorvald Meyers gate and Toftes gate. In 1864, a square meter had been priced at about 30 Norwegian shilling Active selling of property started in 1865. However, even as Thorvald Meyer offered low-priced land, almost no one bought any of it until after 1868.

The park square called Olaf Ryes plass has its name from Norwegian-Danish General Olaf Rye (1791–1849). It was an open field well into the 1880s. The property was bought by Oslo kommune from members of the Grüner family in 1883. A narrow diagonal street was built which led from Markveien to Thorvald Meyers gate. It had a stopping spot for horses and carriages at the middle point. This section is now a pedestrian park square. The district&#x27;s previous logo showed Mangelsgården, a listed building in Storgata 36 that is part of Prinds Christian Augusts Minde. From 2019, the district has used a common logo for Oslo.

==Politics==
As a borough of Oslo, Grünerløkka is governed by the city council of Oslo as well as its own borough council. The council leader is Geir Jensen from the Green Party and the deputy leader is Vemund Rundberget, of the Labour Party. The Green Party has the most seats. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties for the 2019-2023 term:

* 4 from the Green Party (Miljøpartiet de Grønne)
* 3 from the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet)
* 3 from the Conservative Party (Høyre)
* 2 from the Red Party (Rødt)
* 2 from the Socialist Left Party (Sosialistisk Venstreparti)
* 1 from the Liberal Party (Venstre)

==Sports==
The neighbourhood has its own sports club, Grüner, which was founded in 1914 with ice hockey and football as the most important activities. Grüner Fotball plays its home games at Dælenenga idrettspark and currently is part of the third division of the Norwegian football system. The ice hockey team plays the home games at Grünerhallen.

<text>Ullern is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway.

== History ==
The borough has its name from an old farm, Norse &quot;Ullarin&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the Norse god Ullr. The last element is &quot;vin&quot;, meaning pasture or meadow. In medieval times, the farm belonged to the monastery at Hovedøya. Following the Reformation in 1536, the farmland was separated between the crown and the local canon. Formally divided into lower and upper Ullern in 1740, both farms were bought by Herman Severin Løvenskiold, in 1878 and 1866 respectively.

At the time, Ullern was a part of the rural municipality Aker. Signs of urbanization began in the 1800s, when Skøyen and areas along the Lysaker River, which divides Ullern from Bærum, began developing into industrial sites. The 1872 opening of the Drammen Line railway was a catalyst for further building activity, as were the 1912 opening of the Smestad Line and the 1919 extension of the Skøyen Line to Lilleaker. The two latter lines were later extended further, in 1935 and 1924 respectively. In 1942, a connection between the two lines, between Jar and Sørbyhaugen, was opened, providing public rail transportation to the northern part of Ullern. In 1948, Ullern became a part of Oslo, when Oslo absorbed the entire Aker municipality. In the post-World War II period, the villa-dominated housing was supplemented by tower blocks, scattered across the borough.

== Geography ==

Neighborhoods in the borough of Ullern include Lysejordet, Øraker, Lilleaker, Sollerud, Vækerø, Bestum, Ullern, Bjørnsletta, Ullernåsen, Montebello, Hoff and Skøyen.

The borough borders the Lysaker River and Bærum municipality in the west, Lysakerfjorden and Bygdøy in the south, Frogner borough in the east and Vestre Aker borough in the north. Before the borough mergers of 2003, the neighboring boroughs were Røa and Vinderen in the north and Uranienborg-Majorstuen and Bygdøy-Frogner in the east.
The hill Ullernåsen reaches 201 metres above sea level. It is known for its volcanic origin.

== Transportation ==
Ullern is served by the Lilleaker Line and Skøyen Line of the Oslo Tramway, the Kolsås Line of the Oslo T-bane and the Drammen Line railroad. The stations within the borough are Øraker, Lilleaker, Sollerud, Furulund, Bestum, Ullern, Abbediengen, Hoff and Skøyen (Oslo Tramway); Bjørnsletta, Åsjordet, Ullernåsen and Montebello (Oslo T-bane); and Skøyen (Drammen Line). Defunct stations are Bestum (Oslo Tramway); Lysakerelven, Old Bjørnsletta, Sørbyhaugen, Husebybakken (Oslo T-bane) and Bestun (Drammen Line).

The European route E18 runs through the southern part of the borough. At Vækerø, the Norwegian national road 160 branches off and heads north-east, passing Furulund station, the Old Bjørnsletta station and Lysakerelven station before crossing the Oslo-Bærum border at Jar. The Ring 3 starts at Lysaker, crosses the Oslo-Bærum border in the southern Granfoss Tunnel, emerges at Mustad before entering the northern Granfoss Tunnel, finally emerging near Ullern Church. It passes the Radium Hospital before continuing into Vestre Aker at Smestad.

The residents also have access to boat traffic from nearby Lysaker, and until 1998 access to the now-defunct Oslo Airport, Fornebu.

== Business ==
Major commercial areas are found at Lilleaker, Vækerø and Skøyen. The shopping mall CC Vest is located at Lilleaker, partially utilizing the former locales of the manufacturing company O. Mustad &amp; Son. A locomotive production company, Thunes Mekaniske Værksted, had its localities at Thune, but is now defunct. Until the 2000s, Norges Varemesse ran a large convention center at Skøyen. The Norwegian Radium Hospital, opened in 1931, is located at Montebello. Slightly east of the Radium Hospital is Smestad fire station, opened in 1947. There are several schools in the borough, but no institutions of higher education.

== Culture ==

Ullern is a parish in the Church of Norway, but the borders do not correspond with the borough borders. The parish was separated from Vestre Aker in 1906, and later on Røa and Skøyen were separated from Ullern, in 1957 and 1984 respectively. Ullern church, serving the parish of Ullern, was raised in 1903. The parish of Skøyen had its church raised in 1989. The parishes of Ullern and Skøyen are parts of Vestre Aker deanery, in turn a part of the Diocese of Oslo.

The local newspaper is &quot;Ullern Avis Akersposten&quot;. &quot;Aftenposten&quot; is widespread as well.

=== Sports ===
The local multi-sports team is Ullern IF. It was founded in 1909, and absorbed the neighboring teams Bestum IF and Liull in 1972. Their home field, used for football and bandy matches, is located near Lysakerelven station. The indoor arena Ørakerhallen is used for handball and basketball matches; its basketball team last won the national title in 1996. The tennis club Ullern TK split from Ullern IF in 1992, and has its courts at Blokkajordet. Since 2000 it also owns 25% of the national tennis arena at Hasle. Notable players include Thorvald Moe and Jan Frode Andersen.

Ullern had several ski jumping hills in the past. Ullernbakken in Ullernåsen was demolished in 1958. Another hill, Husebybakken, was the venue of the competition Husebyrennet between 1879 and 1891. The competition was moved to the hill Holmenkollen in 1892, starting the Holmenkollen ski festival.

In addition, boat sports are popular. The rowing club Bestumkilen RK and the canoeing club Oslo KK are based in Bestumkilen, an arm of Lysakerfjorden. Leisure boating is also widespread.

== Politics ==
As a borough of Oslo, Ullern is governed by the city council of Oslo as well as its own borough council. The council leader is Carl Oscar Pederson from the Conservative Party, and the deputy leader is Ingrid Hopp, also of the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party has the most seats. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties for the 2019-2023 term:

*8 from the Conservative Party (&quot;Høyre&quot;)
*2 from the Labour Party (&quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot;)
*2 from the Green Party (Miljøpartiet de Grønne)

<text>Gamle Oslo is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway. The name means &quot;Old Oslo&quot;, and the district contains Old Town.

The borough has several landmarks and large parks, including the Edvard Munch Museum, the Botanical Gardens and a medieval park.

<text>Majorstuen or Majorstua is a particularly affluent neighbourhood in the Frogner borough in the inner part of Oslo, Norway.

Majorstuen is known for its vibrant downtown and especially its shopping area. The area has several elegant townhouses c. 1880–1890. The area is also an important public transport junction in Oslo, where all metro lines, three tram lines and five bus lines operate. It is served by Majorstuen station.

==The name==
The neighborhood was named after a well-known public house that was located on the east side of Sørkedalsveien. Dating from the 1700s, the house was named for Captain Michael Wilhelm von Sundt (1679–1753). The last element is the finite form of &quot;stue&quot; &#x27;cabin, house with a single room&#x27;. There has long been a disagreement about the forms &quot;Majorstuen&quot; and &quot;Majorstua&quot;: &quot;stuen&quot; is the articulated form when &quot;stue&quot; is treated as a masculine, and &quot;stua&quot; is the articulated form when it is treated as a feminine noun. The original pronunciation was &quot;-stua&quot; (Norwegian feminine inflection) but, because Danish was the only written language in Norway well into the 19th century, the name was written &quot;-stuen&quot; (Danish common gender inflection). The locals say either, but the local borough council has also adopted &quot;Majorstuen&quot; as the official name of the area. (For a similar disagreement, see Akerselva.)
==Majorstuen Church==
Majorstuen Church (&quot;Majorstuen kirke&quot;) was consecrated on 26 March 1926 as Priest&#x27;s Church (&quot;Prestenes kirke&quot;) when it was built for the funds collected among Norwegian clergymen. Oslo Municipality took over the church in the 1960s and changed its name to Majorstuen Church. Majorstuen Church was designed by architects August Nielsen (1877–1956) and Harald Sund (1876–1940) in the style of Classicism with influences of art deco and neo-baroque. The main church has 400 seats and was built of brick. The chapel, &quot;Cappella Johannea&quot;, is decorated with frescos with themes from the Book of Revelation, executed by the artist Per Vigeland (1904–1968) in 1932. The altar picture is titled: The Christian Hope (&quot;Det kristne håp&quot;). The tapestry is by designer and textile artist, Else Marie Jakobsen.

==Majorstuen School==
Majorstuen school is the primary and secondary school in Majorstuen. The school was designed by architect Bredo Henrik Berntsen (1877–1957). The first phase was completed in 1908.
==Majorstuen Station==
Majorstuen station (&quot;Majorstuen stasjon&quot;) is the last common point for all subway lines on the western side of Oslo. The station was opened in 1898 as the terminus for Holmenkollbanen. It remained so until Smestadbanen was completed in 1912. In 1928 the tunnel to the National Theatre station (called the Underground Railway) was built. The original station building was built in 1916, when Tryvandsbanen was completed. It was designed by Erik Glosimodt who also designed a number of shelters and station buildings along Holmenkollbanen. It had two entrances, one for Holmenkollbanen, and one for Smestadbanen. When the work of underground track started, the station was destroyed. The current Majorstuen station dates to 1930 and was designed by Kristoffer Lange.

<text>Sinsen is a mixed residential and commercial area in Grünerløkka borough of Oslo, Norway. The westernmost part of Sinsen is part of the borough Nordre Aker.

The Sinsen Interchange, located on the border between the boroughs of Nordre Aker, Grünerløkka and Bjerke, was the first roundabout in Norway. It has since developed into a multi-lever intersection, with both Ring 3, National Road 4 and the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway routes around. &quot;North of the Sinsen Interchange&quot; is common expression in the Norwegian district debates, where inhabitants of Oslo are accused of being ignorant of the country north of the interchange. The expression cropped up in revues during the 1960s, and is probably due to that Sinsen then was the end point for the main road leading into Oslo from the north.

The area is served by the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway. The Oslo T-bane serves the neighborhood at Sinsen Station,
while the Gjøvik Line serves the area at Grefsen Station.

==The name==
The neighbourhood is named after the old farm Sinsen (Norse &quot;Sinnsin&quot;, from &quot;*Sinnsvin&quot;). The first element is the genitive of &#x27; meaning &quot;road&quot;, and the last element is &#x27; meaning &quot;meadow&quot;. The area was an important crossroads also in old times, where the road from the bottom of Oslofjord ramified into the road east to Romerike and north to Maridalen/Hadeland.

<text>Stovner (traditionally pronounced Stomner) is a borough located to the far north east of the city of Oslo, Norway. Historically, Stovner was the name of a farm in the municipal borough &quot;Østre Aker&quot;. Østre Aker merged with Oslo in 1948, both instigated and followed by a massive expansion of the city settlement. Today&#x27;s Stovner borough is constructed atop the home fields of the Stovner farm, the first record of which dates back to the 14th century, as well as on the fields of several other farms that were situated in the area covered by the borough. The bulk of the modern high-rise structures were built by Selvaag and completed in the first half of the 1970s, together with several schools, a subway line into central Oslo, and an administrative center for the borough. The last three stations of Grorudbanen — Rommen, Stovner and Vestli — are in the Stovner borough.

Stovner is the borough in Oslo and Norway with the highest density of immigrants. The proportion of newborns with an immigrant background was per. 2017 at 80%.

<text>Bygdøy or Bygdø is a peninsula situated on the western side of Oslo, Norway. Administratively, Bygdøy is part of the borough of Frogner. It historically was part of Aker Municipality and became part of Oslo in 1948.

Bygdøy is a popular recreation area and is among the most fashionable residential areas in Norway, where the most expensive properties in the entire country are found. Bygdøy is also the home of five national museums as well as a royal estate. Wealthy families of Christiania acquired country houses in Bygdøy during the 18th and 19th centuries; by the 19th century Bygdøy had become a favourite of the wealthy in the capital region and was exclusively settled by the wealthy and their servants.

== Tourism ==

Bygdøy has parks and forests, and beaches including the Huk ordinary and nudist beaches. In 1885 there were only 111 houses at Bygdøy; today most of the huge gardens are split into smaller patches of land, making Bygdøy largely a residential zone but retaining a profile of upscale demographics. Bygdøy Royal Estate (&quot;Bygdøy kongsgård&quot;), the official summer residence of the King of Norway, and Oscarshall, site of the Queen Joséphine Gallery, are also located here. Large parts of the area such as the Bygdøy Royal Estate are protected from development.
In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a memorial for the victims of the catastrophe was initiated by the Norwegian government. The memorial is located on the western shore of Bygdøy and was officially unveiled by HM King Harald V on 19 October 2007.

==Museums==

Bygdøy is the site of five museums: 
*Kon-Tiki Museum (&quot;Kon-Tiki Museet&quot;) – houses exhibits from the expeditions of Thor Heyerdahl
*Norwegian Museum of Cultural History (&quot;Norsk Folkemuseum&quot;) – an open-air museum with buildings, relocated from towns and rural districts
*Viking Ship Museum (&quot;Vikingskipshuset&quot;) – houses the Oseberg ship, Gokstad ship and Tune ship
*Norwegian Maritime Museum (&quot;Norsk Maritimt Museum&quot;) – exhibits on coast culture and maritime history
*Fram Museum (&quot;Frammuseet&quot;) – site of the ship &quot;Fram&quot; used by Roald Amundsen

==Etymology==

The name is from Norse times (&quot;Bygðey&quot;). The first element is &quot;bygð&quot; &#x27;built district&#x27; (area with houses and population) – in Norse times this was the only inhabited island in the inner part of Oslofjord. The last element is &quot;ey&quot; &#x27;island&#x27;. (Bygdøy was originally an island, but it became a peninsula because of post-glacial rebound.)

The island belonged to the Cistercian monastery at Hovedøya, but it was confiscated by the Crown in 1532. The name was then changed to &quot;Ladegaardsøen&quot;. The first element in this new name was &quot;ladegård&quot; meaning &quot;farm to give a manor (here Akershus fortress) income&quot;. The last element &quot;&quot;-øen&quot; is the Danish finite form of &quot;ø&quot;&quot; or &quot;island&quot;. The old name was revived in 1877. It was first spelled &quot;Bygdø&quot;, but from 1918 officially spelled &quot;Bygdøy&quot;. However, the name Bygdø is preferred by many of its inhabitants and other West End inhabitants.

==Transportation==
Bygdøy is accessible by bus, as the Oslo Public Transport Administration&#x27;s bus line n.30 runs every 10 minutes from Nydalen via Sentrum and Nationaltheatret. Between April and October, the neighborhood can also be reached by the local public ferry departing from Aker Brygge every 30 minutes. Cars are allowed and there is a modest parking lot in front of the Kon-Tiki Museum.

<text>Frogner is a residential and retail borough in the West End of Oslo, Norway, with a population of 59,269 as of 2020. In addition to the original Frogner, the borough incorporates Bygdøy, Uranienborg and Majorstua. The borough is named after Frogner Manor, and includes Frogner Park. The borough has the highest real estate prices in Norway.

==Etymology==
The borough is named after the old Frogner Manor. The Norse form of the name was &quot;Fraunar&quot; (plural form), and is likely derived from the word &quot;frauð&quot; &#x27;manure&#x27; — meaning &#x27;fertilized fields&#x27;. (See also Frogn and Tøyen.) English-speaking foreigners may assume the word “Frogner” to be related to the English word frog but these words are not congnates. The word for “frog” in Norwegian is “frosk”.

Note that the name is commonly pronounced more closely to “Frong-nair” rather than “Frog-ner”; both are considered acceptable.

==History==
The area became part of the city of Oslo (then Christiania) in 1878. The borough was originally the grounds of an 18th-century country estate, Frogner Manor. The manor is now the site of Oslo City Museum. The Vigeland installation is located in Frogner Park (&quot;Frognerparken&quot;)

A majority of the houses in the borough were built around 1900. Frogner has historically been and continues to be an affluent area of Oslo.

==Districts==
Traditional districts of Oslo belonging to the borough are:
* Bygdøy
* Frogner
* Majorstua
* Uranienborg

== Politics ==
As a borough of Oslo, Frogner is governed by the city council of Oslo, as well as its own borough council. The council leader is Jens Lie from the Conservative Party and the deputy leader is Carl-Henrik Bastiansen, also of the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party has the most seats. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties for the 2019–2023 term:

* 7 from the Conservative Party (&quot;Høyre&quot;)
* 2 from the Labour Party (&quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot;)
* 2 from the Green Party (Miljøpartiet de Grønne)
* 1 from the Progress Party (&quot;Fremskrittspartiet&quot;)
* 1 from the Socialist Left Party (&quot;Sosialistisk Venstreparti&quot;)
* 1 from the Liberal Party (&quot;Venstre&quot;)
* 1 from the Red Party (Rødt)

==Frogner in modern times==
The Bygdøy peninsula is the current site of the Viking ship Museum, Norsk Folkemuseum (Norwegian Museum of Cultural History), the Maritime Museum, the Kon-Tiki Museum, and the ship Fram, used by Roald Amundsen for his Antarctic expedition. The royal estate of Bygdøy kongsgård and the Oscarshall palace are also located here. Bygdøy has several public beaches and is a popular recreational area.

On January 1, 2004, the previous borough of &quot;Uranienborg-Majorstua&quot; and &quot;Bygdøy-Frogner&quot; were merged with Frogner, creating the current, larger borough.

The borough is known for its many villas and parks. It is one of the most expensive boroughs in Oslo due its central location, proximity to parks, marinas and attractive architecture, and the historical legacy of being a choice residential district for the upper classes during the 19th century.

Many of these expansive estates are now embassies, diplomatic missions, and other diplomatic representations.

<text>Grorud is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway. The borough contains the Ammerud, Grorud, Kalbakken, Rødtvet, Nordtvet and Romsås areas. To the north of the borough is the forest of Lillomarka. The borough is the smallest in Oslo, with fewer than 30 000 inhabitants.

The area now known as Grorud was mostly farm land until after World War II, an exception being Grorud proper, where mining was an important livelihood. Granite from Grorud is seen in many buildings in downtown Oslo - with the lion sculptures in front of Stortinget, the Norwegian Parliament being the most famous example. Textile industries were also a part of the urbanization of Grorud, with the river Alna and its waterfalls as power supply.

The railway station at Grorud, from 1854, is one of the oldest in Norway and was a hub of the whole Grorud Valley for many years until the arrival of urbanization and the subway. Some of the old farms are still present in the Grorud landscape, although apartment buildings now are a more dominant part of the scenery.

Traditionally a borough inhabited by the working class, Grorud has in the last few decades had a great influx of immigrants. The proportion of newborns with immigrant background was per. 2017 at 70%. Because of these statistics Grorud is a recurring theme in Norwegian immigration politics.

== Politics ==
As a borough of Oslo, Grorud is governed by the city council of Oslo as well as its own borough council. The council leader is Anders Røberg-Larsen from the Labour Party and the deputy leader is Alejandro Decap, of the Socialist Left Party. The Green Party has the most seats. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties for the 2019-2023 term:

* 7 from the Labour Party (&quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot;)
* 2 from the Progress Party (&quot;Fremskrittspartiet&quot;)
* 2 from the Conservative Party (Høyre)
* 2 from the Red Party (Rødt)
* 1 from the Socialist Left Party (&quot;Sosialistisk Venstreparti)&quot;
* 1 from the Green Party (Miljøpartiet de Grønne)

==Notable people==

*Trygve Lie, First Secretary-General of the United Nations
*Willy Bakken († 2010) popular culture writer
*Jan Bøhler (b. 1952), politician, member of parliament
*Flamur Kastrati (b. 1991), Norwegian footballer, from Rødtvet

<text>Ekeberg is a neighborhood in the city of Oslo, Norway. The Norway Cup soccer tournament takes place at Ekebergsletta every summer. &quot;Sletta&quot; means &quot;the plain&quot;. The painting &quot;The Scream&quot; by Edvard Munch is painted from Utsikten (&quot;the view&quot;), a part of Ekeberg.

In the area are a number of old Iron Age grave mounds and Bronze Age ritual sites. This establish the area of Ekeberg as one of the oldest inhabited places around Oslo. During the Middle Ages, the farm of Ekeberg belonged to Hovedøya Abbey. The area was later taken by the crown.

From 1760, the farm of Ekeberg was run by an appointed owner, and his relatives owned the farm thereafter. In the area, a number of small homesteads under the main farm was erected the following century. The first suburban settlement came around 1900, and the early suburb was raised in the years prior to 1935. Many of the early houses are still present in the area. Ekeberg belonged to Oslo from 1947.

In 1926 Roald Amundsen&#x27;s airship &quot;Norge&quot;, was on its way from Italy to Svalbard, stopped in Oslo, mooring at Ekeberg at a specially-constructed mast, the foundation of which can still be seen today at the north end of the park. 

The farm land (Ekebergsletta) cultivated crops until 1950, and the farm still had goats and small cattle up to 1965. The neighborhood of Ekeberg is situated on a bluff overlooking the city. During the 19th century, the air was considered excellent for tuberculosis patients. 
Shortly after World War II, there were discussions on how to use the area, and the idea of an airport for Oslo was suggested. This was rejected, and the Labour party politician Rolf Hofmo, who had survived internment at the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen during the Second World War, proposed the idea of a free area for sport and other activities.

Ekeberg-Bekkelaget was a borough of Oslo up to January 1, 2004, when it became part of the Gamle Oslo and Nordstrand boroughs.

Ekeberg as a geographical area was mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in his &quot;Saga of the Kings&quot;. In the northern part of the area the farm &quot;Ekeberg Hovedgård&quot; is located. The fields of the farm are now a part of Ekebergsletta and the camp ground where the main building still stands.

The name: Old Norse &quot;Eikaberg&quot; - the first element is the genitive plural case of &quot;eik&quot; f &#x27;oak&#x27;, the last element is &quot;berg&quot; n &#x27;mountain&#x27;.

Sculpture Park
A sculpture park, Ekebergparken Sculpture Park opened in 2013 on the initiative of the Norwegian businessman and multimillionaire Christian Ringnes. The park contains numerous works of art from Norwegian and international artists, among others, Salvador Dalí, Lynn Chadwick, Richard Hudson and Per Ung. The sculpture park is located in an area that has been open space and public park since the 1800s.

In literature
Many Norwegian authors and poets have written poems and appraisals of the area. Among them Henrik Wergeland, Hans E. Kinck, and Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, who also wrote down the local folklore from the area, concerning the Ekeberg Troll, living inside the hill. Hans Christian Andersen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson apparently established their friendship while admiring the view of the city. Later, Ingeborg Refling Hagen lived in the area, establishing a cultural work which was known as the Ekeberg Colony.

A curious mentioning of the area occurs in the cult novel The Call of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft, written in 1926. Here it is stated that the surviving sailor Gustaf Johansen lived in &quot;an old house at Egeberg&quot; where he died after ramming Cthulhu head on with a fishing vessel.

<text>Bekkelaget is a neighborhood in the borough Nordstrand in Oslo, Norway.

Originally, Bekkelaget was the maritime area south of Oslo city, in Aker municipality adjacent to the Bunnefjorden. With the opening of the Østfold Line, Bekkelaget station was opened, and the elevated area between Ekeberg and Nordstrand was built up and more densely populated. This area was called Bekkelagshøgda, while the maritime area became known as Nedre Bekkelaget. This area is separated by Ormsund with Ormøya.

Until 2004 Bekkelaget and adjacent Ekeberg constituted its own borough, &quot;Ekeberg-Bekkelaget&quot;.

Bekkelaget is known nationwide for the sports club Bækkelagets SK. The local rowing club is Ormsund RK.

<text>Sogn was a district of the city of Oslo, Norway until January 1, 2004, when it became part of the Nordre Aker district.

The name was chosen in 1972, as the city council decided to divide Oslo into 34 districts. Each district had 13 members of a district committee, elected by the city council for four years. The district committee decided on the local name Sogn.

Sogn and Berg are probably the oldest known farm estates in the district. Hovedbølet on Berg farm estate is placed outside of the district limits today. Sognsvann gave its name to the farm estate Sogn, which was divided into three Sogngårder: Østre Sogn, Vestre Sogn and Lille Sogn (Nordberg). Known names were taken by other areas or institutions: Nordberg (parish), Tåsen school district / voting district, and Korsvoll school district / voting district. Berg-area is divided by its district border to the west, with Berg school (and farm estate) just outside its district border.

<text>Bøler () is a south-eastern suburb of Oslo, Norway. It is one of the more picturesque areas of Oslo. Østmarka forest and lake Nøklevann are in its immediate vicinity. Infrastructure-wise, it has a shopping center , two elementary schools, a public bath, a library, a church and a stop on the Østensjøbanen metro line.

==History==

The name &quot;Bøler&quot; comes from Old Norse &quot;bæl&quot; (farm). The area was mostly built up in the late 1950s, with high-rise buildings and smaller houses.

Bøler was a separate borough of the city of Oslo, Norway from the mid-1980s up to December 31, 2003, when it became part of the borough of Østensjø.

<doc id="218159" wikidata="Q4577070" url="?curid=218159" title="Romsås">
<text>Romsås is a neighborhood in the city of Oslo, Norway. Located northeast of Groruddalen, at the edge of Lillomarka, Romsås was formerly its own borough but was merged into the larger borough of Grorud on January 1, 2004. The name Romsås originated with the Romsås farm which by 1850 was one of the biggest farms in Østre Aker.

== History ==

With the expansion of Oslo after the Second World War, Oslo kommune granted , a housing company, a permit to build a new borough in 1967. Construction started in 1969. The borough was formally established in 1973.

== Subdivisions ==

Romsås is divided into six &quot;borettslag&quot; named after local geographical features: Orremyr, Emanuelfjell, Svarttjern, Røverkollen, Ravnkollen, and Tiurleiken. There are also six kindergartens, two elementary schools, a middle school, an assisted living facility (Romsåslia), and a center (Romsås senter) with social housing, a retirement home, shops and services, and a swimming pool. A subway station is located under the center, 50 m below ground level.

With the exception of Romsåslia and the church, all buildings are located on the inside of a single road which starts at Grorud and loops back on itself in the shape of an elongated “q”.

== Romsås Church ==

Romsås Church (&quot;Romsås kirke&quot;) is a 220-seat brick church designed in a postmodern style by architect Arne E. Sæther, with an altarpiece by Nina Sundbye. It was built on the ruins of an earlier wooden structure which burned down in 1986, and was inaugurated in 1995. As the site was formerly a landfill, the church has suffered significant subsidence damage since its construction.

<doc id="218165" wikidata="Q1699509" url="?curid=218165" title="John C. Stennis">
<text>John Cornelius Stennis (August 3, 1901 – April 23, 1995) was an American politician who served as a U.S. senator from the state of Mississippi. He was a Democrat who served in the Senate for over 41 years, becoming its most senior member for his last eight years. He retired from the Senate in 1989, and is, to date, the last Democrat to have been a U.S. senator from Mississippi. At the time of his retirement, Stennis was the last senator to have served during the presidency of Harry S. Truman.

While attending law school, Stennis won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives, holding office from 1928 to 1932. After serving as a prosecutor and state judge, Stennis won a special election in 1947 to fill the U.S. Senate vacancy following the death of Theodore G. Bilbo. He won election to a full term in 1952 and remained in the Senate until he declined to seek re-election in 1988. Stennis became the first Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and also chaired the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations. He also served as President pro tempore of the Senate from 1987 to 1989. In 1973, President Richard Nixon proposed the Stennis Compromise, whereby the famously hard-of-hearing Stennis would be allowed to listen to, and summarize, the Watergate tapes, but this idea was rejected by Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

Along with fellow Mississippi senator James Eastland, Stennis was a zealous supporter of racial segregation. He and Eastland supported the Dixiecrat ticket in 1948 headed by Strom Thurmond, and signed the Southern Manifesto, which called for massive resistance to the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. He also voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He renounced support for segregation in the early 1980s and supported the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, but voted against the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday, instead favoring a &quot;commemorative day&quot; as he opposed additional federal holidays. He was also the trial level prosecutor of &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot; (1936). The transcript of the trial indicated Stennis was fully aware that the confession was obtained by subjecting three black defendants to brutal whippings and hanging by the officers.

== Early life and education ==

John Stennis was born into a middle-class family in Kemper County, Mississippi, as the son of Hampton Howell Stennis and Margaret Cornelia Adams. His great-grandfather John Stenhouse emigrated from Scotland to Greenville, South Carolina, just before the American Revolution.

He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Mississippi State University in Starkville (then Mississippi A&amp;M) in 1923. In 1928, Stennis obtained a law degree from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. While in law school, he won a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives, representing Kemper County, in which he served until 1932. Stennis was a prosecutor from 1932 to 1937 and a circuit judge from 1937 to 1947, both for Mississippi&#x27;s Sixteenth Judicial District. He was the prosecuting attorney in a case where three African Americans had been beaten and tortured for a confession; in &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that it was a clear deception of court and jury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured, and a clear denial of due process.

Stennis married Coy Hines, and together they had two children, John Hampton and Margaret Jane. His son, John Hampton Stennis (1935–2013), an attorney in Jackson, Mississippi, ran unsuccessfully in 1978 for the United States House of Representatives, defeated by the Republican Jon C. Hinson, then the aide to U.S. Representative Thad Cochran.

== U.S. Senate ==
=== Early career ===

Upon the death of Senator Theodore Bilbo in 1947, Stennis won the special election to fill the vacancy, winning the seat from a field of five candidates (including two sitting Congressmen, John E. Rankin and William M. Colmer). He was elected to a full term in 1952, and was reelected five more times. From 1947 to 1978, he served alongside James Eastland; thus Stennis spent 31 years as Mississippi&#x27;s junior senator even though he had more seniority than most of his colleagues. He and Eastland were at the time the longest serving Senate duo in American history, later broken by the South Carolina duo of Strom Thurmond and Fritz Hollings. He later developed a good relationship with Eastland&#x27;s successor, Republican Thad Cochran.

Leading up to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Stennis supported the drafting of General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Democratic nominee amid wide-ranging suspicion that President Truman could not win re-election, considering Eisenhower an acceptable candidate to Southerners. The declaration of support for civil rights at the Democratic National Convention had resulted in Southern members dissatisfied with the move and seeking to espouse their own ideology in the form of a rebellion, Stennis and Eastland being the only sitting senators to openly back the movement. According to biographer Maarten Zwiers, Stennis was less forward in his racism than Eastland and initially hesitated to take an outspoken position against civil rights, likely underestimating the contempt for the civil rights backing of the national party in Mississippi. He adopted harsher condemnation of the program after receiving criticism.

In July 1948, the Senate voted on anti-poll tax legislation. Stennis said Congress did not have the constitutional authority to enact such a measureit had been brought up for political expediency.

On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to &quot;condemn&quot; Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy on two counts by a vote of 67 to 22. Two days later, Stennis advocated for the Senate to adopt rule changes proposed by the Special Censure Committee.

In March 1955, Stennis supported legislation that would increase the national cotton acreage with an amendment providing increases in cotton planting and wheat acreage.

Beginning in early 1956, along with Eastland, Allen Ellender, and Strom Thurmond, Stennis was one of several senators to meet in the office of Georgia Senator Richard Russell. Randall Bennett Woods describes the group as being &quot;out for blood&quot; and being pushed by extremists in their respective states to show Southerners would not be intimidated by the North.

In January 1958, senators received a report on the development of intermediate and intercontinental missiles from Bernard A. Schriever. During two interviews after its release, Stennis said attention should be placed on the speed of production and he was satisfied with the contents of the report pertaining to the development of PGM-17 Thor.

In May 1958, responding to President Eisenhower&#x27;s placing the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sending in the 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect nine black students&#x27; entry to the all-white, public Little Rock Central High School, Stennis announced he had challenged the legality of placing guardsmen there. He stated that the Eisenhower administration had violated both the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, also believing President Eisenhower was neither &quot;reckless nor mischievous&quot;.

During the 1960 presidential election campaign, Stennis advocated for Mississippi voters to back Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kennedy rather than a slate of unpledged electors. Mississippi was won in the general election by the unpledged electors.

In July 1961, after Senate Republicans announced that they would cooperate with the Kennedy administration&#x27;s enlarged defense bill, Stennis stated the possibility of the program requiring a boost in taxes but that he would not vote for an increase until the Senate had made every effort toward finding another way to make the payment.

In early 1962, as the Justice Department retaliated against a Mississippi official charged with refusing to register black voters, Stennis led Southern senators in opposition to the Kennedy administration&#x27;s literacy test bill during a debate on the measure.

In September 1963, Stennis, Eastland, and Georgia Senator Richard Russell jointly announced their opposition to the ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty. Stennis announced his opposition to the treaty on the Senate floor, arguing that its enactment would lead to military disadvantages. The opposition was viewed as denting hopes of the Kennedy administration to be met with minimal disagreement during the treaty&#x27;s appearance before the Senate.

In 1964, Stennis voted against the Civil Rights Act, and, in 1965, he voted against the Voting Rights Act. Mississippi at the time had the largest percentage of black citizens of any state in the union (42%). 

In 1966, Stennis was initiated as an honorary member of the Delta Lambda chapter (Mississippi State) of Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity.

In June 1967, Stennis announced that the Senate Ethics Committee would give &quot;early preliminary consideration&quot; to misconduct charges against Senator Edward V. Long of Missouri.

Stennis wrote the first Senate ethics code, and was the first chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. In August 1965, Stennis protested the Johnson administration&#x27;s emergency supplemental appropriation request for the Vietnam War. In August 1967, Stennis advocated for an expansion of bombing North Vietnam to hasten what he believed would be the war&#x27;s conclusion, adding that either restrictions or a pause could be a mistake. In July 1969, Stennis proposed dividing South Vietnam into two zones and one would be used for the United States to attempt ending the war. In December, Stennis supported the creation of a special commission by President Richard Nixon with the intent of investigating alleged Vietnamese civilian slayings at the hands of American soldiers.

In July 1968, Stennis served as floor manager of a bill intended to ease congestion that had throttled American airports in recent days by providing increased equipment and personnel, publicly saying the legislation had been put off for too long.

In 1969, Stennis introduced the Nixon administration&#x27;s proposal for a draft lottery that would subject all potential draftees to a one-year period where they could be called, Stennis saying that studies would be conducted to see about hearings on the matter in 1970, ahead of the then-current law expiring in 1971. An aide for the senator confirmed his support for the administration&#x27;s policy.

=== 1970s ===

In January 1970, Stennis stated his intent to call on presidential candidates in the upcoming presidential election to visit states outside of the South and tell parents, &quot;I&#x27;ll do to your schools what we&#x27;ve done to the schools in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana if I&#x27;m elected President&quot; predicting any candidate who did so would be defeated. He viewed the upholding of &quot;de facto&quot; segregation — i.e. segregation via demographics — in the North as an unfair double standard against the outlawing of &quot;de jure&quot; segregation — i.e. segregation by law — in the South. Stennis subsequently submitted an amendment to an education funding bill that would implement uniform desegregation standards federally.

On February 12, White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon was in favor of the North and the South being treated equally on the issue of segregation, refusing to interpret his remarks as an endorsement of the Stennis desegregation amendment. Several days later, on February 18, the Senate voted 56–36 in favor of the Stennis amendment, Stennis afterward stating that the vote was &quot;a landmark... a new gateway... a turning point.&quot; Stennis admitted he did not expect a difference in the temperament of the South, but that it could potentially lead to the North understanding the importance of the issue to southerners in having to maintain the same policy. After the amendment was removed in the conference report, on April 1, Stennis and Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff attempted to recommit the bill back to conference with the amendment added back in; this time, the Senate rejected it in a 32–43 vote. In May, Stennis opined that the Supreme Court had dodged its duty by passing on the question of the legality or illegality of segregated schools outside of the South. Stennis said the question &quot;must and should be decided as promptly as possible because a political decision is being made to continue the integration efforts in the South but leave the other areas of the country virtually untouched.&quot; In June, as the Senate passed a $4.8billion education bill, it also defeated an amendment by Stennis to strike certain restrictions in an amendment by Senator Jacob K. Javits for aid to desegregating schools.

In February 1970, Stennis was named as one of the members of Congress to sit on a subcommittee created to study whether the United States needed another nuclear‐powered aircraft carrier priced at $640million.

In 1971, Stennis sponsored a measure to enforce school desegregation laws in areas where segregation had been caused by residential patterns and in communities where segregation had been sanctioned by law. Stennis said the measure would eliminate what he called a double standard where Southern schools were forced to integrate their communities or face a loss of federal aid while Northern schools were allowed to remain segregated. The policy, noted for its similarity to the amendment sponsored by Stennis the previous year, was passed in the Senate on April 22 in a 44 to 34 vote.

In May 1971, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard sent a letter to Stennis concerning an amendment by Harold Hughes to the draft extension bill, warning that the bill could lead to base closings and serious economic problems.

In July 1972, Stennis said it was essential that Congress appropriate $20.5million for the funding of military supplies and research to meet the basic requirements for the national defense program.

In January 1973, Stennis was shot twice, in the left side of his chest and left thigh, outside his Washington home by two teenagers. The suspects apparently robbed him of his wallet, a watch, and twenty-five cents.

On January 23, 1974, sources disclosed that Stennis had met with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Thomas H. Moorer for discussions on military snooping in the White House allegations, a Moorer spokesman confirming the meeting but downplaying it as &quot;a routine courtesy call traditionally made in the opening days of a Congressional session&quot;.

On February 9, Stennis met privately with Charles Radford, a member of the United States Navy who admitted removing documents from the files of Henry Kissinger in addition to delivering them to the Pentagon. After the meeting&#x27;s conclusion, Stennis said Radford &quot;was cooperative fully and I have no complaints about him&quot;.

In April, Stennis attended the Annual Convention of the Mississippi Economic Council at the Mississippi State Coliseum in Jackson, Mississippi. President Nixon said &quot;no State in the Union is represented by men in the Congress of the United States who more vigorously speak up for their States and for the Nation than has the State of Mississippi&quot; and Stennis would be among those &quot;when they write profiles in courage&quot;.

In May 1974, amid the Senate&#x27;s voting to approve a bill increasing public access to Government information and documents, Stennis opposed an amendment by Maine Senator Edmund Muskie that would have deleted some guidelines for federal judges involving classified information, on the grounds that they were &quot;flirting here with things that can be deadly and dangerous to our national welfare&quot;. The amendment passed 56 to 29.

In November 1974, Stennis announced his intent to advocate for the creation of a congressional fact‐finding committee to investigate the possibility of a conspiracy being behind price disparities.

In March 1976, amid the Senate voting unanimously to seat Henry Bellmon, Stennis was one of nine Democrats to vote alongside Republicans to put aside a motion declaring the Senate unable to determine a winner and the seat would require a special election to fill the vacancy. Later that month, Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire requested Stennis delay action on the nomination of Albert Hall as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. In May, Stennis and Texan John Tower cosponsored a measure to remove the Select Committee on Intelligence&#x27;s legislative jurisdiction over Defense Department intelligence operations, the amendment being defeated 63 to 31. In June 1976, Stennis joined a coalition of Democrats endorsing Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter for the presidency. The &quot;New York Times&quot; assessed Stennis and Eastland as jointly &quot;trying to pull Mississippi out for Mr. Carter&quot; in their first campaign for a national Democrat in decades.

In February 1977, after President Jimmy Carter selected Paul Warnke as his nominee for Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Stennis announced that Warnke had agreed to testify before the Armed Services Committee. On April 16, President Carter announced his approval for full or substantial funding of the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Carter&#x27;s approval had prevented him from &quot;having to fight with&quot; Stennis, Eastland, and John J. Sparkman. In June, Stennis authorized a request by Colorado Democrat Gary Hart to delay hearings on the promotion of Donn A. Starry to United States Army Training and Doctrine Command; Starry was later confirmed to the position. In July, President Carter sent Stennis a letter stating his decision on deployment would come after he received reports on the neutron bomb from the Pentagon and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. After the November death of Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan, Stennis was seen as a potential chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in the event Warren Magnuson did not attempt to take the position himself.

In April 1978, after President Carter announced a halt on production of neutron weapons, Stennis was known to be one of the senators dissatisfied with the decision. In July, Stennis introduced an amendment to the Endangered Species Act which would authorize any head of a government agency to be able to decide whether the individual&#x27;s agency had a project that outweighed the importance of preserving a species. The amendment was defeated 76 to 22.

In September 1978, after the House voted to approve a $37billion defense spending bill, Stennis made moves toward producing a new bill that maintained similar attributes to the House-passed measure with the exception of the carrier. Defense Secretary Harold Brown issued a statement a short time afterward praising Stennis and Representatives Melvin Price and George H. Mahon as &quot;dedicated and patriotic Americans&quot;, rhetoric that was seen as matching the tone &quot;evidently designed to repair the rift the veto opened between the White House and defense leaders in Congress&quot; used by President Carter in his own statement. In October, the Carter administration disclosed that President Carter had reversed his choice to not approve construction of the large nuclear‐powered aircraft carrier. Carter was said to have personally assured Stennis he would not veto the carrier.

==== 1970 re-election campaign ====

==== Vietnam ====

In April 1970, in response to the Nixon administration&#x27;s choice to back efforts by the South Vietnamese in Cambodia, senators made moves toward ending funding for American military aid there. Stennis and Michigan Senator Robert P. Griffin described the operation as one limited in scale and with the purpose of destroying sanctuaries of the North Vietnamese and Vietcong in Cambodia on the South Vietnam border. In July, Stennis advocated for the United States adopting an Anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to safeguard against Soviet SS‐9 intercontinental ballistics missiles and called on fellow senators to recall &quot;the grim fact of rapidly increasing Russian strategic forces which could place this country in jeopardy in the years ahead.&quot; In August, as the Senate voted to bar the United States from paying larger allowances to allied troops in Vietnam than it pays to American soldiers, Stennis said he was impressed with the legislation and that he would be in favor if &quot;some adjustment can be made consistent with our honor&quot;. Stennis also pledged to try arranging an agreement between the two chambers on the final military procurement bill. Stennis furthered that the United States &quot;would have to observe any commitments it might have already made, and that some delicacy might be necessary since American forces are leaving Vietnam.&quot; In September, the Senate voted on the McGovern–Hatfield Amendment, a proposal that would have required the end of military operations in Vietnam by December 31, 1970, and a complete withdrawal of American forces halfway through the next year. Stennis argued the amendment was constitutional and that Congress had &quot;the sole power to appropriate money&quot; but opposed it on the grounds that it would harm the American negotiating position. The amendment was defeated in a vote of 55 to 39.

In May 1971, the Senate rejected legislation designed to prohibit assignments of draftees to combat in Vietnam after the end of the year without consent on the part of the draftees. Stennis said the legislation would have caused the creation of two classes of soldiers where one group could fight and the other could not while arguing that any army unit &quot;would be rendered inoperative if each man&#x27;s record had to be reviewed by the commanders before they acted in an emergency&quot;.

In March 1972, John D. Lavelle was relieved of duty as commander of the Seventh Air Force in Southeast Asia due to alleged misconduct over bombing missions in Vietnam, President Nixon announcing the appointment of Creighton W. Abrams as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army by Nixon in June. A week later, during a Senate floor speech, Stennis announced a full hearing would be conducted around the pending retirement of Lavelle, his announcement coming in light of new testimony linking Creighton W. Abrams to an unauthorized bombing of North Vietnam. The move by Stennis was viewed as serving &quot;to complicate further an already intricate series of changes at the top of the Army&#x27;s command structure&quot;. On September 13, Stennis said there was a conflict in the testimony of Abrams and Lavelle regarding the intricacies of the strikes, specifying the difference in who was behind them and their planning. This difference, he stated, would need further inspection from the committee, declining to specify the particular conflict in their account while speaking to newsmen. Later that month, Lavelle sent Stennis a letter detailing his activities and other information pertaining to the case.

In April 1973, Stennis, in a statement drafted at Walter Reed Army Hospital while he was still recovering from gunshot injuries, called for legislation that would prevent the President from restoring American troops in Vietnam without congressional backing. The Senate, in a vote of 71 to 18, approved a similar measure in July, barring the president from being able to commit American armed forces to future foreign hostilities without the consent of Congress. Stennis sent a letter to Edmund Muskie advising that cluttering the &quot;war powers bill with other matters&quot; would give the measure the possibility of overriding a veto.

In May 1974, Stennis announced the Senate Armed Services Committee had approved $21.8billion in weapons production and research for the upcoming fiscal year, a 5.6 percent decrease in the funding requested by the Nixon administration.

==== Other foreign policy issues ====

In May 1970, Stennis argued against an amendment by Frank Church and John Sherman Cooper that if enacted would prohibit funds for retaining American troops in Cambodia, telling Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright he did not understand how a president could select a date without assurance there would be no reversals in battle. After Stennis recalled President Nixon&#x27;s having made an estimate on when the U.S. would exit the conflict, Fulbright said Stennis had confirmed his belief that Nixon did not mean it when he said American involvement in Cambodia would be over by July 1. Stennis then charged Fulbright with putting words in his mouth.

On May 12, 1971, Stennis introduced legislation curbing the ability of the president to commence war without congressional consent. Stennis called the choice to declare war &quot;too big a decision for one mind to make and too awesome a responsibility for one man to bear&quot; and that he was aiming for Congress to give consideration to the idea posed in his measure for roughly a year before drafting any legislation. The introduction of the measure was viewed &quot;as one of those potentially historic moments when the action of one man can turn the tide of policy&quot;. In June, the Senate turned down an amendment by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy that would have enabled young men registering for the draft have the right to lawyer and hearings in the style of a courtroom before their local draft boards. With multiple amendments still needing to be voted on by the chamber, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield afterward announced that Stennis, Hugh Scott, and himself would present a petition to end a debate.

On July 31, 1972, Stennis announced his support for the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.

In September 1973, the White House disclosed President Nixon had written Stennis, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, and Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott to urge Senate approval of the full weapons budget requested by his administration. Days later, the Senate rejected an amendment by Mansfield requiring a reduction in American troops abroad in a vote of 51 to 44 after initially voting in favor of it. Along with Texan Lloyd Bentsen, Stennis was noted as one of two Democratic senators to have backed the Nixon administration who were absent during the first vote.

In September 1974, Stennis argued in favor of the $82.5billion defense appropriations bill the Senate sent to the White House, a measure noted for having a $4.4billion decrease in the amount requested by the Ford administration for the 1975 fiscal year, saying it was not reducing &quot;the muscle of America&#x27;s military&quot;.

In May 1977, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson named Stennis as one of the senators who was part of a bipartisan attempt to develop, in reference to the SALTII treaty, &quot;the kind of agreement that... will stabilize the situation in the world.&quot; By May 1979, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Stennis was one of the moderate senators who would swing the vote on the SALTII treaty and along with West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd was viewed as &quot;possibly timing their decisions to influence other waverers&quot;. On June 19, Stennis, Robert Byrd, and Frank Church consented to the Senate Armed Services Committee holding separate hearings on SALTII on July 23, allowing the Senate Foreign Relations committee to have two weeks as the only committee reviewing the treaty.

At the end of January 1978, Stennis announced his opposition to the Panama Canal treaties, citing their causing the U.S. to withdrawal from the Canal Zone too rapidly, a move that he furthered would leave the U.S. &quot;highly uncertain what is going to happen down there&quot;.

In July 1978, the Senate voted to approve the construction of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and military spending bill authorizing the Pentagon to spend $36 billion for weapons. Stennis stated his hope and prediction &quot;that this will be the last bill that will have a carrier of this type&quot;.

In September 1979, Stennis held a private meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance over the Soviet brigade in Cuba. Stennis also met with President Carter for a discussion on future arms spending which failed to resolve a disagreement over budget increases that could potentially determine the fate of the proposed treaty to limit strategic arms. Stennis said after the meeting he believed the senators had made some progress with Carter. Later that month, on September 27, President Carter signed the Panama Canal Act of 1979 into law, saying in part, &quot;I particularly want to thank Senators Stennis and Levin and Congressmen Murphy, Bowen, and Derwinski for their outstanding leadership in resolving the many difficult issues embodied in this act.&quot; In October, during a committee hearing, Stennis stated his opposition to suggestions recommending that the Senate postpone action on the strategic arms treaty with the Soviet Union until the following year, and that he believed the treaty debate in the Senate should continue on the ground that the issue would likely be more clear at the present time than it possibly would months later. Stennis, by then considered an influential member of the Senate to newer members in both parties, was seen as &quot;useful to President Carter in trying to stave off attempts to delay or kill the pact&quot;. In December, the Senate Armed Services Committee agreed on a formula for making public a report condemning the pending nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union on the condition that the report would not make any specific recommendation to the Senate while concluding that the treaty was not in the &quot;national security interests&quot; of the United States without undergoing major changes. Making the report public was seen as a victory to opponents of the treaty but also by Senate aides as having a larger impact on Stennis&#x27;s authority, the aides citing Stennis finally having bent to pressure from senators opposed to the treaty over issuing the report and possibly weakening his control over the committee.

==== Watergate ====

In October 1973, during the Watergate scandal, the Nixon administration proposed the Stennis Compromise, wherein the hard-of-hearing Stennis would listen to the contested Oval Office tapes and report on their contents, but this plan went nowhere. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a picture of John Stennis that read: &quot;Technical Assistance Needed&quot;. The picture had his hand cupped around his ear.

In January 1974, during a telephone interview, Stennis indicated his intent to investigate on allegations of military spying in the White House, saying he did not expect the White House to intervene with the inquiry and confirmed he was not familiar with the spying until news reports. After Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Stennis opposed pursuing criminal charges, arguing that his leaving office was enough punishment. The resignation was followed a month later by President Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon, a move Stennis and other conservative Democrats favored.

==== 1976 re-election campaign ====

In January 1974, Stennis said his health was without complications (from the shooting in 1973) and that he would be running for another term in 1976. Stennis was re-elected without opposition.

=== 1980s ===

In November 1980, Defense Secretary Harold Brown sent two letters to Stennis complaining that the House of Representatives had added $7.5billion in new programs and deleted $5billion in administration programs for a net increase of $2.5billion and urging the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense instead approve the administration&#x27;s budget. The Senate instead approved $161billion, $6billion more than what the administration proposed and $3.5million more than approved in the House.

In early 1981, Stennis was replaced by John Tower as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Virginia Senator John Warner said: &quot;With no disrespect to Senator John Stennis, our former chairman, John Tower will provide a more vigorous thrust to the committee.&quot;

In spring 1981, Stennis predicted there would be larger opposition to military spending in the event of new proposals in favor of more funds being allocated. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred back to Stennis in July when Senator Mark Hatfield conducted his first detailed foray into military spending as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In a Senate floor speech, Stennis warned that &quot;great pressure&quot; to an increase would persist with continued showing of a deficit in the federal budget and Americans would stop supporting the military and its budget &quot;if our military forces do not show real improvement without damaging the health of our economy&quot;.
In June 1982, Stennis was renominated for a seventh term, defeating Charles Pittman and radio station owner Colon Johnston by a large margin. Stennis faced political operative Haley Barbour in the general election. Barbour&#x27;s supporters poked fun at Stennis&#x27;s age, an issue the senator made self-deprecating comments about. President Ronald Reagan met with Stennis during the general election and promised he would not campaign for Barbour, despite Reagan&#x27;s taping an ad for Barbour attacking Stennis for his age.

Stennis lost his left leg to cancer in 1984 and subsequently used a wheelchair.

Stennis was named President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the 100th Congress (1987–1989). During his Senate career he chaired, at different times, the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, and the Armed Services, and Appropriations Committees.

Stennis opposed President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 23, 1987, Stennis voted with all but two Democrats, and six Republicans against Bork&#x27;s nomination, which was defeated by a vote of 42–58.

In February 1988, along with Robert Byrd and John Melcher, Stennis was one of three senators to attend the traditional reading of the farewell address of President George Washington by North Carolina Senator Terry Sanford. That same month, he was one of twelve Democrats to support the Reagan administration-backed $43million aid to Nicaraguan rebels.

In June 1988, Stennis voted against a bill authorizing the use of the death penalty on drug dealers convicted of murder.

A dinner in honor of Stennis was held on June 23, 1988, in the Sheraton Ballroom of the Sheraton Washington Hotel. President Reagan delivered an address praising Stennis for his service in the Senate and announced &quot;as an expression of the Nation&#x27;s gratitude for the public service of the man we honor tonight, the Navy&#x27;s next nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, CVN-74, will be christened .&quot;

=== Civil rights record ===

Based on his voting record, Stennis was an ardent supporter of racial segregation. In the 1950s and 1960s, he vigorously opposed the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968; he signed the Southern Manifesto of 1956, supporting filibuster tactics to block or delay passage in all cases.

Earlier, as a prosecutor, he sought the conviction and execution of three black sharecroppers whose murder confessions had been extracted by torture, including flogging, hanging, and strangulation. The convictions were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark case of &quot;Brown v. Mississippi&quot; (1936) which banned the use of evidence obtained by torture. The transcript of the trial indicated Stennis was fully aware the suspects had been tortured.

Stennis told Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt that black people &quot;had come down from the trees a lot later than we did.&quot;

Later in his political career, Stennis supported one piece of civil rights legislation, the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which passed in the Senate by an 85–8 vote. A year later, he voted against establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a federal holiday. Stennis campaigned for Mike Espy in 1986 during Espy&#x27;s successful bid to become the first black Congressman from the state since the end of Reconstruction.

== Retirement and death==

In 1982, his last election, Stennis easily defeated Republican Haley Barbour. Declining to run for re-election in 1988, Stennis retired in 1989, having never lost an election. He took a teaching post at his alma mater, Mississippi State University, working there until his death in Jackson, Mississippi, at the age of 93. One of his student aides at Mississippi State University, David Dallas, wrote and performed a one-man play about his time with the senator.

At the time of Stennis&#x27;s retirement, his continuous tenure of 41 years and 2months in the Senate was second only to that of Carl Hayden. (It has since been surpassed by Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, Ted Kennedy, Daniel Inouye, Patrick Leahy, Orrin Hatch, and Chuck Grassley, leaving Stennis ninth).

Stennis died on April 23, 1995, at St. Dominic–Jackson Memorial Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, at the age of 93. He is buried at Pinecrest Cemetery in Kemper County.

<doc id="218169" wikidata="Q2135518" url="?curid=218169" title="Dangling modifier">
<text>A dangling modifier (also known as a dangling participle, illogical participle or hanging participle) is a type of ambiguous grammatical construct whereby a grammatical modifier could be misinterpreted as being associated with a word other than the one intended. A dangling modifier has no subject and is usually a participle. A writer may use a dangling modifier intending to modify a subject while word order may imply that the modifier describes an object, or vice versa.

An example of a dangling modifier appears in the sentence &quot;Turning the corner, a handsome school building appeared&quot;. The modifying clause &quot;Turning the corner&quot; describes the behavior of the narrator, but the narrator is only implicit in the sentence. The sentence could be misread as the &quot;turning&quot; action attaching either to the &quot;handsome school building&quot; or to nothing at all. As another example, in the sentence &quot;At the age of eight, my family finally bought a dog&quot;, the modifier &quot;At the age of eight&quot; is dangling. It is intended to specify the narrator&#x27;s age when the family bought the dog, but the narrator is again only implicitly a part of the sentence. It could be read as the &quot;family&quot; was eight years old when it bought the dog.

== Dangling-modifier clauses ==
As an adjunct, a modifier clause is normally at the beginning or the end of a sentence and usually attached to the subject of the main clause. However, when the subject is missing or the clause attaches itself to another object in a sentence, the clause is seemingly &quot;hanging&quot; on nothing or on an inappropriate noun. It thus &quot;dangles&quot;, as in these sentences:
In the first sentence, the adjunct clause may at first appear to modify &quot;the trees&quot;, the subject of the sentence. However, it actually modifies the speaker of the sentence, who is not explicitly mentioned. In the second sentence, the adjunct may at first appear to modify &quot;the sun&quot;, the subject of the sentence. Presumably, there is another, human subject who did reach the station as the sun was coming out, but this subject is not mentioned in the text. In both cases, whether the intended meaning is obscured or not may depend on context - if the previous sentences clearly established a subject, then it may be obvious who was walking down Main Street or reaching the station. But if left alone, they may be unclear if the reader takes the subject as an unknown observer; or misleading if a reader somehow believed the trees were walking down the street or the sun traveled to the station.

Many style guides of the 20th century consider dangling participles ungrammatical and incorrect. Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; states that &quot;A participle phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject&quot;. The 1966 book &quot;Modern American Usage: A Guide&quot;, started by Wilson Follett and finished by others, agrees: &quot;A participle at the head of a sentence automatically affixes itself to the subject of the following verb – in effect a requirement that the writer either make his [grammatical] subject consistent with the participle or discard the participle for some other construction&quot;. However, this prohibition has been questioned; more descriptivist authors consider that a dangling participle is only problematic when there is actual ambiguity. One of Follett&#x27;s examples is &quot;Leaping to the saddle, his horse bolted&quot;, but a reader is unlikely to be genuinely confused and think that the horse was leaping into a saddle rather than an implicit rider; &quot;The Economist&quot; questioned whether the &quot;clumsy examples&quot; of the style guides proved much. Many respected and successful writers have used dangling participles without confusion; one example is Virginia Woolf whose work includes many such phrases, such as &quot;Lying awake, the floor creaked&quot; (in &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;) or &quot;Sitting up late at night it seems strange not to have more control&quot; (in &quot;The Waves&quot;). Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; includes a dangling modifier as well.

===Absolute constructions===
Dangling participles are similar to clauses in absolute constructions, but absolute constructions are considered uncontroversial and grammatical. The difference is that a participle phrase in an absolute construction is not semantically attached to any single element in the sentence. A participle phrase is intended to modify a particular noun or pronoun, but in a dangling participle, it is instead erroneously attached to a different noun or to nothing; whereas in an absolute clause, is not intended to modify any noun at all, and thus modifying nothing is the intended use. An example of an absolute construction is:

The weather being beautiful, we plan to go to the beach today.
== Non-participial modifiers ==
Non-participial modifiers that dangle can also be troublesome:

After years of being lost under a pile of dust, Walter P. Stanley, III, left, found all the old records of the Bangor Lions Club.

The above sentence from a photo caption in a newspaper suggests that it is the subject of the sentence, Walter Stanley, who was buried under a pile of dust, and not the records. It is the prepositional phrase &quot;after years of being lost under a pile of dust&quot; which dangles.

In the film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, Mr. Dawes Sr. dies of laughter after hearing the following joke:

&quot;I know a man with a wooden leg called Smith&quot;.

&quot;What was the name of his other leg?&quot;

In the case of this joke, the placement of the phrase &quot;called Smith&quot; implies that it is the leg that is named Smith, rather than the man.

Another famous example of this humorous effect is by Groucho Marx as Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding in the 1930 film &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;:

Though under the most plausible interpretation of the first sentence, Captain Spaulding would have been wearing the pajamas, the line plays on the grammatical possibility that the elephant was instead.

Certain formulations can be genuinely ambiguous as to whether the subject, the direct object, or something else is the proper affix for the participle; for example, in &quot;Having just arrived in town, the train struck Bill&quot;, did the narrator, the train, or Bill just arrive in the town?

== Modifiers reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker ==
Participial modifiers can sometimes be intended to describe the attitude or mood of the speaker, even when the speaker is not part of the sentence. Some such modifiers are standard and are not considered dangling modifiers: &quot;Speaking of [topic]&quot;, and &quot;Trusting that this will put things into perspective&quot;, for example, are commonly used to transition from one topic to a related one or for adding a conclusion to a speech. An example of a contested use would be &quot;Frankly, he is lying to you&quot;; such usage is not uncommon by writers, but strictly speaking that sentence would be in violation of older style guide prohibitions as it is the speaker being frank, not &quot;he&quot; in such a sentence.

=== Usage of &quot;hopefully&quot; ===

Since about the 1960s, controversy has arisen over the proper usage of the adverb &quot;hopefully&quot;. Some grammarians object to constructions such as &quot;Hopefully, the sun will be shining tomorrow&quot;. Their complaint is that the term &quot;hopefully&quot; is understood as the manner in which the sun will shine if read literally, with the suggested modification &quot;I hope the sun will shine tomorrow&quot; if it is the speaker that is full of hope. &quot;Hopefully&quot; used in this way is a disjunct (cf. &quot;admittedly&quot;, &quot;mercifully&quot;, &quot;oddly&quot;). Disjuncts (also called sentence adverbs) are useful in colloquial speech for the concision they permit.
No other word in English expresses that thought. In a single word we can say it is regrettable that (&quot;regrettably&quot;) or it is fortunate that (&quot;fortunately&quot;) or it is lucky that (&quot;luckily&quot;), and it would be comforting if there were such a word as &quot;hopably&quot; or, as suggested by Follett, &quot;hopingly&quot;, but there isn&#x27;t. [...] In this instance nothing is to be lost – the word would not be destroyed in its primary meaning – and a useful, nay necessary term is to be gained.
What had been expressed in lengthy adverbial constructions, such as &quot;it is regrettable that ..&quot;. or &quot;it is fortunate that ..&quot;., had of course always been shortened to the adverbs &quot;regrettably&quot; or &quot;fortunately&quot;. Bill Bryson says, &quot;those writers who scrupulously avoid &#x27;hopefully&#x27; in such constructions do not hesitate to use at least a dozen other words – &#x27;apparently&#x27;, &#x27;presumably&#x27;, &#x27;happily&#x27;, &#x27;sadly&#x27;, &#x27;mercifully&#x27;, &#x27;thankfully&#x27;, and so on – in precisely the same way&quot;.

Merriam-Webster gives a usage note on its entry for &quot;hopefully&quot;; the editors point out that the disjunct sense of the word dates to the early 18th century and has been in widespread use since at least the 1930s. Objection to this sense of the word, they state, became widespread only in the 1960s. The Merriam Webster editors maintain that this usage is &quot;entirely standard&quot;.

<doc id="218181" wikidata="Q82542" url="?curid=218181" title="Tet Offensive">
<text>The Tet Offensive was a major escalation and one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War. The Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched a surprise attack on 30 January 1968 against the forces of the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), the United States Armed Forces and their allies. It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout South Vietnam. The name is the truncated version of the Lunar New Year festival name in Vietnamese, Tết Nguyên Đán, with the offense chosen during a holiday period as most ARVN personnel were on leave. The purpose of the wide-scale offensive by the Hanoi Politburo was to trigger political instability in a belief that mass armed assault on urban centers would trigger defections and rebellions.

The offensive was launched prematurely in the early morning hours of 30 January in large parts of the I and II Corps Tactical Zones of South Vietnam. This early attack allowed allied forces some time to prepare defensive measures. When the main operation began during the early morning hours of 31 January, the offensive was countrywide; eventually more than 80,000 PAVN/VC troops struck more than 100 towns and cities, including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns and the southern capital. The offensive was the largest military operation conducted by either side up to that point in the war.

Hanoi had launched the offensive in the belief that it would trigger a popular uprising leading to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. Although the initial attacks stunned the allies, causing them to lose control of several cities temporarily, they quickly regrouped, repelled the attacks and inflicted heavy casualties on PAVN/VC forces. The popular uprising anticipated by Hanoi never materialized. During the Battle of Huế, intense fighting lasted for a month, resulting in the destruction of the city. During its occupation, the PAVN/VC executed thousands of people in the Massacre at Huế. Around the American combat base at Khe Sanh, fighting continued for two more months.

The offensive was a military defeat for North Vietnam, as neither uprisings nor ARVN unit defections occurred in South Vietnam. However, this offensive had far-reaching consequences for its effect on the views of the Vietnam War by the American public and the world broadly. General Westmoreland reported that defeating the PAVN/VC would require 200,000 more American soldiers and activation of the reserves, prompting even loyal supporters of the war to admit that the current war strategy required reevaluation. The offensive had a strong effect on the U.S. government and shocked the American public, which had been led to believe by its political and military leaders that the North Vietnamese were being defeated and incapable of launching such an ambitious military operation. American public support for the war declined as a result of the Tet casualties and the escalation of draft calls. Subsequently, the Johnson Administration sought negotiations to end the war. Shortly before the 1968 United States presidential election, Republican candidate and former vice president Richard Nixon encouraged South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu to become publicly uncooperative in the negotiations, casting doubt on Johnson&#x27;s ability to bring peace.

The term &quot;Tet offensive&quot; usually refers to the January–February 1968 offensive, but it can also include the so-called &quot;Mini-Tet&quot; offensive that took place in May and the Phase III offensive in August, or the 21 weeks of unusually intense combat that followed the initial attacks in January.

== Background ==

=== South Vietnam political context ===
Leading up to the Tet Offensive were years of marked political instability and a series of coups after the 1963 South Vietnamese coup. In 1966, the leadership in South Vietnam, represented by the Head of State Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ were persuaded to commit to democratic reforms in an effort to stabilize the political situation at a conference in Honolulu. Prior to 1967, the South Vietnamese constituent assembly was in the process of drafting a new constitution and eventual elections. The political situation in South Vietnam, after the 1967 South Vietnamese presidential election, looked increasingly stable. Rivalries between South Vietnam&#x27;s generals were becoming less chaotic, and Thiệu and Kỳ formed a joint ticket for the election. Despite efforts by North Vietnam to disrupt elections, higher than usual turnouts saw a political turning point towards a more democratic structure and ushered in a period of political stability after a series of coups had characterized the preceding years.

Protests, campaigning and the atmosphere of elections were interpreted by the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam and Lê Duẩn as signs that the population would embrace a &#x27;general uprising&#x27; against the government of South Vietnam. The Politburo sought to exploit perceived instability and maintain political weakness in South Vietnam.

=== United States war strategy ===

During late 1967, the question whether the U.S. strategy of attrition was working in South Vietnam weighed heavily on the minds of the American public and the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. General William C. Westmoreland, the commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), believed that if a &quot;crossover point&quot; could be reached by which the number of communist troops killed or captured during military operations exceeded those recruited or replaced, the Americans would win the war. There was a discrepancy, however, between the order of battle estimates of the MACV and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) concerning the strength of VC guerrilla forces within South Vietnam. In September, members of the MACV intelligence services and the CIA met to prepare a Special National Intelligence Estimate that would be used by the administration to gauge U.S. success in the conflict.

Provided with an enemy intelligence windfall accrued during Operations Cedar Falls and Junction City, the CIA members of the group believed that the number of VC guerrillas, irregulars, and cadre within the South could be as high as 430,000. The MACV Combined Intelligence Center, on the other hand, maintained that the number could be no more than 300,000. Westmoreland was deeply concerned about the possible perceptions of the American public to such an increased estimate since communist troop strength was routinely provided to reporters during press briefings. According to MACV&#x27;s chief of intelligence, General Joseph A. McChristian, the new figures &quot;would create a political bombshell&quot;, since they were positive proof that the North Vietnamese &quot;had the capability and the will to continue a protracted war of attrition&quot;.

In May, MACV attempted to obtain a compromise from the CIA by maintaining that VC militias did not constitute a fighting force but were essentially low-level fifth columnists used for information collection. With the groups deadlocked, George Carver, CIA Special Assistant for Vietnam Affairs, represented the CIA in the last stage of the negotiations. In September, Carver devised a compromise: The CIA would drop its insistence on including the irregulars in the final tally of forces and add a prose addendum to the estimate that would explain the agency&#x27;s position. George Allen, Carver&#x27;s deputy, laid responsibility for the agency&#x27;s capitulation at the feet of Richard Helms, the director of the CIA. He believed that &quot;it was a political problem ... [Helms] didn&#x27;t want the agency ... contravening the policy interest of the administration.&quot;

During the second half of 1967 the administration had become alarmed by criticism, both inside and outside the government, and by reports of declining public support for its Vietnam policies. According to public opinion polls, the percentage of Americans who believed that the U.S. had made a mistake by sending troops to Vietnam had risen from 25 percent in 1965 to 45 percent by December 1967. This trend was fueled not by a belief that the struggle was not worthwhile, but by mounting casualty figures, rising taxes, and the feeling that there was no end to the war in sight. A poll taken in November indicated that 55 percent wanted a tougher war policy, exemplified by the public belief that &quot;it was an error for us to have gotten involved in Vietnam in the first place. But now that we&#x27;re there, let&#x27;s win—or get out.&quot; This prompted the administration to launch a so-called &quot;success offensive&quot;, a concerted effort to alter the widespread public perception that the war had reached a stalemate and to convince the American people that the administration&#x27;s policies were succeeding. Under the leadership of National Security Advisor Walt W. Rostow, the news media then was inundated by a wave of effusive optimism.

Every statistical indicator of progress, from &quot;kill ratios&quot; and &quot;body counts&quot; to village pacification, was fed to the press and to the Congress. &quot;We are beginning to win this struggle&quot;, asserted Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show in mid-November. &quot;We are on the offensive. The territory is being gained. We are making steady progress.&quot; At the end of November, the campaign reached its climax when Johnson summoned Westmoreland and the new U.S. Ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker, to Washington, D.C., for what was billed as a &quot;high-level policy review&quot;. Upon their arrival, the two men bolstered the administration&#x27;s claims of success. From Saigon, pacification chief Robert Komer asserted that the CORDS pacification program in the countryside was succeeding, and that sixty-eight percent of the South Vietnamese population was under the control of Saigon while only seventeen percent was under the control of the VC. General Bruce Palmer Jr., one of Westmoreland&#x27;s three Field Force commanders, claimed that &quot;the Viet Cong has been defeated&quot; and that &quot;He can&#x27;t get food and he can&#x27;t recruit. He has been forced to change his strategy from trying to control the people on the coast to try to survive in the mountains.&quot;

Westmoreland was even more emphatic in his assertions. At an address at the National Press Club on 21 November, he reported that, as of the end of 1967, the communists were &quot;unable to mount a major offensive ... I am absolutely certain that whereas in 1965 the enemy was winning, today he is certainly losing...We have reached an important point when the end begins to come into view.&quot; By the end of the year the administration&#x27;s approval rating had indeed crept up by eight percent, but an early January Gallup poll indicated that forty-seven percent of the American public still disapproved of the President&#x27;s handling of the war. The American public, &quot;more confused than convinced, more doubtful than despairing ... adopted a &#x27;wait and see&#x27; attitude.&quot; During a discussion with an interviewer from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Westmoreland dared the communists to launch an attack: &quot;I hope they try something because we are looking for a fight.&quot;

== North Vietnam ==

=== Party politics ===
Planning in Hanoi for a winter-spring offensive during 1968 had begun in early 1967 and continued until early the following year. According to American sources, there has been an extreme reluctance among Vietnamese historians to discuss the decision-making process that led to the &quot;general offensive and uprising&quot;, even decades after the event. In official Vietnamese literature, the decision to launch the Tet offensive was usually presented as the result of a perceived U.S. failure to win the war quickly, the failure of the American bombing campaign against North Vietnam, and the anti-war sentiment that pervaded the population of the U.S. The decision to launch the general offensive, however, was much more complicated.

The decision signaled the end of a bitter, decade-long debate within the North Vietnamese Government between first two, and then three factions. The moderates believed that the economic viability of North Vietnam should come before support of a massive and conventional southern war and they generally followed the Soviet line of peaceful coexistence by reunifying Vietnam through political means. Heading this faction were party theorist Trường Chinh and Minister of Defense Võ Nguyên Giáp. The militant faction, on the other hand, tended to follow the foreign policy line of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and called for the reunification of the nation by military means and that no negotiations should be undertaken with the Americans. This group was led by Communist Party First Secretary Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ (no relation). From the early to mid-1960s, the militants had dictated the direction of the war in South Vietnam. General Nguyễn Chí Thanh, the head of Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), headquarters for the South, was another prominent militant. The followers of the Chinese line centered their strategy against the U.S. and its allies on large-scale, main force actions rather than the protracted guerrilla war espoused by Mao Zedong.

By 1966–1967, however, after suffering massive casualties, stalemate on the battlefield, and destruction of the northern economy by U.S. aerial bombing, there was a dawning realization that if current trends continued, Hanoi would eventually lack the resources necessary to affect the military situation in the South. As a result, there were more strident calls by the moderates for negotiations and a revision of strategy. They felt that a return to guerrilla tactics was more appropriate since the U.S. could not be defeated conventionally. They also complained that the policy of rejecting negotiations was in error. The Americans could only be worn down in a war of wills during a period of &quot;fighting while talking&quot;. During 1967 things had become so bad on the battlefield that Lê Duẩn ordered Thanh to incorporate aspects of protracted guerrilla warfare into his strategy.

During the same period, a counter-attack was launched by a new, third grouping (the centrists) led by President Hồ Chí Minh, Lê Đức Thọ, and Foreign Minister Nguyễn Duy Trinh, who called for negotiations. From October 1966 through April 1967, a very public debate over military strategy took place in print and via radio between Thanh and his rival for military power, Giáp. Giáp had advocated a defensive, primarily guerrilla strategy against the U.S. and South Vietnam. Thanh&#x27;s position was that Giáp and his adherents were centered on their experiences during the First Indochina War and that they were too &quot;conservative and captive to old methods and past experience... mechanically repeating the past.&quot;

The arguments over domestic and military strategy also carried a foreign policy element, as North Vietnam, like South Vietnam, was largely dependent on outside military and economic aid. The vast majority of North Vietnam&#x27;s military equipment was provided by either the Soviet Union or China. Beijing advocated that North Vietnam conduct a protracted war on the Maoist model, fearing that a conventional conflict might draw China in, as had happened in the Korean War. They also resisted the idea of negotiating with the allies. Moscow, on the other hand, advocated negotiations, but simultaneously armed Hanoi&#x27;s forces to conduct a conventional war on the Soviet model. North Vietnamese foreign policy therefore consisted of maintaining a critical balance between war policy, internal and external policies, domestic adversaries, and foreign allies with &quot;self-serving agendas.&quot;

To &quot;break the will of their domestic opponents and reaffirm their autonomy vis-à-vis their foreign allies&quot;, hundreds of pro-Soviet, party moderates, military officers, and intelligentsia were arrested on 27 July 1967, during what came to be called the Revisionist Anti-Party Affair. All of the arrests were based on the individual&#x27;s stance on the Politburo&#x27;s choice of tactics and strategy for the proposed general offensive. This move cemented the position of the militants as Hanoi&#x27;s strategy: the rejection of negotiations, the abandonment of protracted warfare, and the focus on the offensive in the towns and cities of South Vietnam. More arrests followed in November and December.

=== General offensive and uprising ===
The operational plan for the general offensive and uprising had its origin as the &quot;COSVN proposal&quot; at Thanh&#x27;s southern headquarters in April 1967 and had then been relayed to Hanoi the following month. Thanh was then ordered to the capital to explain his concept in person to the Military Central Commission. At a meeting in July, Thanh briefed the plan to the Politburo. On the evening of 6 July, after receiving permission to begin preparations for the offensive, Thanh attended a party and died of a heart attack after drinking too much. An alternative account is that Thanh died of injuries sustained in a U.S. bombing raid on COSVN after having been evacuated from Cambodia.

After cementing their position during the Party crackdown, the militants sped up planning for a major conventional offensive to break the military deadlock. They concluded that the Saigon government and the U.S. presence were so unpopular with the population of the South that a broad-based attack would spark a spontaneous uprising of the population, which, if the offensive was successful, would enable the North Vietnamese to sweep to a quick, decisive victory. Their basis for this conclusion included: a belief that the South Vietnamese military was no longer combat-effective; the results of the 1967 presidential election (in which the Thiệu/Kỳ ticket had only received 24 percent of the popular vote); the Buddhist crises of 1963 and 1966; well-publicized anti-war demonstrations in Saigon; and continuous criticism of the Thiệu government in the southern press. Launching such an offensive would also finally put an end to what had been described as &quot;dovish calls for talks, criticism of military strategy, Chinese diatribes of Soviet perfidy, and Soviet pressure to negotiate—all of which needed to be silenced.&quot;

In October, the Politburo decided on the Tet holiday as the launch date and met again in December to reaffirm its decision and formalize it at the 14th Plenary session of the Party Central Committee in January 1968. The resultant &quot;Resolution 14&quot; was a major blow to domestic opposition and &quot;foreign obstruction&quot;. Concessions had been made to the center group, however, by agreeing that negotiations were possible, but the document essentially centered on the creation of &quot;a spontaneous uprising in order to win a decisive victory in the shortest time possible.&quot;

Contrary to Western belief, Giáp did not plan or command the offensive himself. Thanh&#x27;s original plan was elaborated on by a party committee headed by Thanh&#x27;s deputy, Phạm Hùng, and then modified by Giáp. The Defense Minister may have been convinced to toe the line by the arrest and imprisonment of most of the members of his staff during the Revisionist Anti-Communist Party Affair. Although Giáp went to work &quot;reluctantly, under duress&quot;, he may have found the task easier due to the fact that he was faced with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Since the Politburo had already approved the offensive, all he had to do was make it work. He combined guerrilla operations into what was basically a conventional military offensive and shifted the burden of sparking the popular uprising to the VC. If it worked, all would be well and good. If it failed, it would be a failure only for the Communist Party militants. For the moderates and centrists, it offered the prospect of negotiations and a possible end to the American bombing of the North. Only in the eyes of the militants, therefore, did the offensive become a &quot;go for broke&quot; effort. Others in the Politburo were willing to settle for a much less ambitious &quot;victory&quot;.

The PAVN official history states that the objectives of the Tet offensive were to: annihilate and cause the total disintegration of the bulk of the puppet army, overthrow the &quot;puppet&quot; (South Vietnamese) regime at all administrative levels, and place all government power in the hands of the people. Annihilate a significant portion of the American military&#x27;s troop strength and destroy a significant portion of his war equipment in order to prevent the American forces from being able to carry out their political and military missions; on the basis, crush the American will to commit aggression and force the United States to accept defeat in South Vietnam and end all hostile actions against North Vietnam. In addition, using this as the basis, they would achieve the immediate goals of the revolution, which were independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality in South Vietnam, and then move toward achieving peace and national unification.

The operation would involve a preliminary phase, during which diversionary attacks would be launched in the border areas of South Vietnam to draw American attention and forces away from the cities. The &quot;general offensive and uprising&quot; would then commence with simultaneous actions on major allied bases and most urban areas, and with particular emphasis on the cities of Saigon and Huế. Concurrently, a substantial threat would have to be made against the U.S. Khe Sanh Combat Base. The Khe Sanh actions would draw PAVN forces away from the offensive into the cities, but Giáp considered them necessary to protect his supply lines and divert American attention. Attacks on other U.S. forces were of secondary, or even tertiary importance, since Giáp considered his main objective to be weakening or destroying the South Vietnamese military and government through popular revolt. The offensive, therefore, was aimed at influencing the South Vietnamese public, not that of the U.S. There is conflicting evidence as to whether, or to what extent, the offensive was intended to influence either the March primaries or the November presidential election in the U.S.

According to General Trần Văn Trà, the new military head of COSVN (B2 Front), the offensive was to have three distinct phases: Phase I, scheduled to begin on 30 January, would be a countrywide assault on the cities, conducted primarily by VC forces. Concurrently, a propaganda offensive to induce ARVN troops to desert and the South Vietnamese population to rise up against the government would be launched. If outright victory was not achieved, the battle might still lead to the creation of a coalition government and the withdrawal of the Americans. If the general offensive failed to achieve these purposes, follow-up operations would be conducted to wear down the enemy and lead to a negotiated settlement; Phase II was scheduled to begin on 5 May and Phase III on 17 August.

Preparations for the offensive were already underway. The logistical build-up began in mid-year, and by January 1968, 81,000 tons of supplies and 200,000 troops, including seven complete infantry regiments and 20 independent battalions made the trip south on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This logistical effort also involved re-arming the VC with new AK-47 assault rifles and B-40 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, which granted them superior firepower over the ARVN. To pave the way and to confuse the allies as to its intentions, Hanoi launched a diplomatic offensive. Foreign Minister Trinh announced on 30 December that Hanoi &quot;would&quot; rather than &quot;could&quot; open negotiations if the U.S. unconditionally ended Operation Rolling Thunder, the bombing campaign against North Vietnam. This announcement provoked a flurry of diplomatic activity (which amounted to nothing) during the last weeks of the year.

South Vietnamese and U.S. military intelligence estimated that PAVN/VC forces in South Vietnam during January 1968 totaled 323,000 men, including 130,000 PAVN regulars, 160,000 VC and members of the infrastructure, and 33,000 service and support troops. They were organized into nine divisions composed of 35 infantry and 20 artillery or anti-aircraft artillery regiments, which were, in turn, composed of 230 infantry and six sapper battalions.

== U.S. unpreparedness ==

=== Suspicions and diversions ===
Signs of impending communist action were noticed among the allied intelligence collection apparatus in Saigon. During the late summer and fall of 1967 both South Vietnamese and U.S. intelligence agencies collected clues that indicated a significant shift in communist strategic planning. By mid-December, mounting evidence convinced many in Washington and Saigon that something big was underway. During the last three months of the year intelligence agencies had observed signs of a major North Vietnamese military buildup. In addition to captured documents (a copy of &quot;Resolution 13&quot;, for example, was captured by early October), observations of enemy logistical operations were also quite clear: in October, the number of trucks observed heading south through Laos on the Hồ Chí Minh Trail jumped from the previous monthly average of 480 to 1,116. By November this total reached 3,823 and, in December, 6,315. On 20 December, Westmoreland cabled Washington that he expected the PAVN/VC &quot;to undertake an intensified countrywide effort, perhaps a maximum effort, over a relatively short period of time.&quot;

Despite all the warning signs, however, the allies were still surprised by the scale and scope of the offensive. According to ARVN Colonel Hoang Ngoc Lung the answer lay with the allied intelligence methodology itself, which tended to estimate the enemy&#x27;s probable course of action based upon their capabilities, not their intentions. Since, in the allied estimation, the communists hardly had the capability to launch such an ambitious enterprise: &quot;There was little possibility that the enemy could initiate a general offensive, regardless of his intentions.&quot; The answer could also be partially explained by the lack of coordination and cooperation between competing intelligence branches, both South Vietnamese and American. The situation from the U.S. perspective was summed up by an MACV intelligence analyst: &quot;If we&#x27;d gotten the whole battle plan, it wouldn&#x27;t have been believed. It wouldn&#x27;t have been credible to us.&quot; The Tet offensive would later be used in a textbook at West Point as an example of &quot;an allied intelligence failure to rank with Pearl Harbor in 1941 or the Ardennes offensive in 1944.&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Dave R. Palmer: &quot;Current Readings in Military History&quot;.

From early to late 1967, the U.S. command in Saigon was perplexed by a series of actions initiated by the PAVN/VC in the border regions. On 24 April a U.S. Marine Corps patrol prematurely triggered a PAVN offensive aimed at taking Khe Sanh Combat Base, the western anchor of the Marines&#x27; defensive positions in Quảng Trị Province. For 49 days during early September and lasting into October, the PAVN began shelling the U.S. Marine outpost of Con Thien, just south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The intense shelling (100–150 rounds per day) prompted Westmoreland to launch Operation Neutralize, an intense aerial bombardment campaign of 4,000 sorties into and just north of the DMZ.

On 27 October, an ARVN battalion at Sông Bé, the capital of Phước Long Province, came under attack by an entire PAVN regiment. Two days later, another PAVN regiment attacked a U.S. Special Forces border outpost at Lộc Ninh, in Bình Long Province. This attack sparked a ten-day battle that drew in elements of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the ARVN 18th Division and left 800 PAVN troops dead at its conclusion.

The most severe of what came to be known as &quot;the Border Battles&quot; erupted during October and November around Dak To, another border outpost in Kon Tum Province. The clashes there between the four regiments of the PAVN 1st Division, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade and ARVN infantry and Airborne elements, lasted for 22 days. By the time the fighting was over, between 1,200 and 1,600 PAVN and 262 U.S. troops had been killed. MACV intelligence was confused by the possible motives of the North Vietnamese in prompting such large-scale actions in remote regions where U.S. artillery and aerial firepower could be applied indiscriminately, which meant that tactically and strategically, these operations made no sense. What the North Vietnamese had done was carry out the first stage of their plan: to fix the attention of the U.S. command on the borders and draw the bulk of U.S. forces away from the heavily populated coastal lowlands and cities.

Westmoreland was more concerned with the situation at Khe Sanh, where, on 21 January 1968, a force estimated at 20,000–40,000 PAVN troops had besieged the U.S. Marine garrison. MACV was convinced that the PAVN planned to stage an attack and overrun the base as a prelude to an all-out effort to seize the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam. To deter any such possibility, he deployed 250,000 men, including half of MACV&#x27;s U.S. maneuver battalions, to I Corps.

This course of events disturbed Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand, commander of U.S. forces in III Corps, which included the sensitive Capital Military District. Weyand, a former intelligence officer, was suspicious of the pattern of communist activities in his area of responsibility and notified Westmoreland of his concerns on 10 January. Westmoreland agreed with his estimate and ordered 15 U.S. battalions to redeploy from positions near the Cambodian border back to the outskirts of Saigon. When the offensive did begin, a total of 27 allied maneuver battalions defended the city and the surrounding area. This redeployment may have been one of the most critical tactical decisions of the war.

=== Before the offensive ===
By the beginning of January 1968, the U.S. had deployed 331,098 Army personnel and 78,013 Marines in nine divisions, an armoured cavalry regiment, and two separate brigades to South Vietnam. They were joined there by the 1st Australian Task Force, a Royal Thai Army regiment, two Republic of Korea Army infantry divisions, and the Republic of Korea Marine Corps brigade. South Vietnamese strength totaled 350,000 regulars in the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. They were in turn supported by the 151,000-man South Vietnamese Regional Forces and 149,000-man South Vietnamese Popular Forces, which were the equivalent of regional and local militias.

In the days immediately preceding the offensive, the preparedness of allied forces was relatively relaxed. Hanoi had announced in October that it would observe a seven-day truce from 27 January to 3 February for the Tet holiday, and the South Vietnamese military made plans to allow recreational leave for approximately half of its forces. General Westmoreland, who had already cancelled the truce in I Corps, requested that South Vietnam cancel the upcoming cease-fire, but President Thiệu (who had already reduced the cease-fire to 36 hours), refused to do so, claiming that it would damage troop morale and only benefit communist propagandists.

On 28 January, eleven VC cadres were captured in the city of Qui Nhơn while in possession of two pre-recorded audio tapes whose message appealed to the populace in &quot;already occupied Saigon, Huế, and Da Nang&quot;. The following afternoon, General Cao Văn Viên, chief of the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff, ordered his four Corps&#x27; commanders to place their troops on alert. Yet, there was still a lack of a sense of urgency on the part of the allies. If Westmoreland had a grasp of the potential for danger, he did not communicate it very well to others. On the evening of 30 January, 200 U.S. officers—all of whom served on the MACV intelligence staff—attended a pool party at their quarters in Saigon. According to James Meecham, an analyst at the Combined Intelligence Center who attended the party: &quot;I had no conception Tet was coming, absolutely zero ... Of the 200-odd officers present, not one I talked to knew Tet was coming, without exception.&quot;

Westmoreland also failed to communicate his concerns adequately to Washington. Although he had warned the President between 25 and 30 January that &quot;widespread&quot; communist attacks were in the offing, his admonitions had tended to be so oblique or so hedged with official optimism that even the administration was unprepared. No one—in either Washington or Vietnam—was expecting what happened.

Weyand invited CBS News Correspondent John Laurence and Washington Post reporter Don Oberdorfer to his III Corps headquarters in the week before the Tet offensive to alert them that a major enemy attack was coming &quot;just before or just after Tet.&quot; He said the Vietnamese had too much respect for the holiday to attack during Tet itself. Weyand said he had moved 30 U.S. and South Vietnamese battalions closer to Saigon to defend the city.

==Offensive==
Whether by accident or design, the first wave of attacks began shortly after midnight on 30 January as five provincial capitals in II Corps and Da Nang, in I Corps, were attacked. Nha Trang, headquarters of the U.S. I Field Force, was the first to be hit, followed shortly by Buôn Ma Thuột, Kon Tum, Hội An, Tuy Hòa, Da Nang, Qui Nhơn, and Pleiku. During all of these operations, the PAVN/VC followed a similar pattern: mortar or rocket attacks were closely followed by massed ground assaults conducted by battalion-strength elements of the VC, sometimes supported by PAVN regulars. These forces would join with local cadres who served as guides to lead the regulars to the most senior South Vietnamese headquarters and the radio station. The operations, however, were not well coordinated at the local level. By daylight, almost all communist forces had been driven from their objectives. General Phillip B. Davidson, the new MACV chief of intelligence, notified Westmoreland that &quot;This is going to happen in the rest of the country tonight and tomorrow morning.&quot; All U.S. forces were placed on maximum alert and similar orders were issued to all ARVN units. The allies, however, still responded without any real sense of urgency. Orders cancelling leaves either came too late or were disregarded.

At 03:00 on 31 January PAVN/VC forces attacked Saigon, Cholon, and Gia Định in the Capital Military District; Quảng Trị (again), Huế, Quảng Tín, Tam Kỳ and Quảng Ngãi as well as U.S. bases at Phú Bài and Chu Lai in I Corps; Phan Thiết, Tuy Hòa and U.S. installations at Bong Son and An Khê in II Corps; and Cần Thơ and Vĩnh Long in IV Corps. The following day, Biên Hòa, Long Thanh, Bình Dương in III Corps and Kien Hoa, Dinh Tuong, Gò Công, Kiên Giang, Vĩnh Bình, Bến Tre, and Kien Tuong in IV Corps were assaulted. The last attack of the initial operation was launched against Bạc Liêu in IV Corps on 10 February. A total of approximately 84,000 PAVN/VC troops participated in the attacks while thousands of others stood by to act as reinforcements or as blocking forces. Palmer gave a figure of 70,000. PAVN/VC forces also mortared or rocketed every major allied airfield and attacked 64 district capitals and scores of smaller towns.

In most cases, the defense was led by the South Vietnamese. Local militia or ARVN forces, supported by the South Vietnamese National Police, usually drove the attackers out within two or three days, sometimes within hours; but heavy fighting continued several days longer in Kon Tum, Buôn Ma Thuột, Phan Thiết, Cần Thơ, and Bến Tre. The outcome in each instance was usually dictated by the ability of local commanders—some were outstanding, others were cowardly or incompetent. During this crucial crisis, however, no South Vietnamese unit broke or defected to the communists.

According to Westmoreland, he responded to the news of the attacks with optimism, both in media presentations and in his reports to Washington. According to closer observers, however, the General was &quot;stunned that the communists had been able to coordinate so many attacks in such secrecy&quot;, and he was &quot;dispirited and deeply shaken.&quot; According to Clark Clifford, at the time of the initial attacks, the reaction of the U.S. military leadership &quot;approached panic&quot;. Although Westmoreland&#x27;s appraisal of the military situation was correct, he made himself look foolish by continuously maintaining his belief that Khe Sanh was the real objective of the North Vietnamese and that 155 attacks by 84,000 troops was a diversion (a position he maintained until at least 12 February). &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Peter Braestrup summed up the feelings of his colleagues by asking &quot;How could any effort against Saigon, especially downtown Saigon, be a diversion?&quot;

===Saigon===

Although Saigon was the focal point of the offensive, the PAVN/VC did not seek a total takeover of the city. Rather, they had six primary targets to strike in the downtown area: the headquarters of the ARVN Joint General Staff, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the Independence Palace, the US Embassy in Saigon, the Republic of Vietnam Navy Headquarters and Radio Saigon. Elsewhere in the city or its outskirts, ten VC Local Force Battalions attacked the central police station and the Artillery Command and the Armored Command headquarters (both at Gò Vấp). The plan called for all these initial forces to capture and hold their positions for 48 hours, by which time reinforcements were to have arrived to relieve them.

The defense of the Capital Military District was primarily a South Vietnamese responsibility and it was initially defended by eight ARVN infantry battalions and the local police force. By 3 February they had been reinforced by five ARVN Ranger Battalions, five Marine Corps, and five ARVN Airborne Battalions. U.S. Army units participating in the defense included the 716th Military Police Battalion, seven infantry battalions (one mechanized), and six artillery battalions.

At the Armored Command and Artillery Command headquarters on the northern edge of the city, the PAVN planned to use captured tanks and artillery pieces, but the tanks had been moved to another base two months earlier and the breechblocks of the artillery pieces had been removed, rendering them useless.

One of the most important targets, from a symbolic and propagandistic point of view, was Radio Saigon. Its troops had brought along a tape recording of Hồ Chi Minh announcing the liberation of Saigon and calling for a &quot;General Uprising&quot; against the Thiệu government. They seized the building, held it for six hours and, when running out of ammunition, the last eight attackers destroyed it and killed themselves using explosive charges, but they were unable to broadcast due to the cutting off of the audio lines from the main studio to the tower as soon as the station was seized.

The US Embassy in Saigon, a massive six-floor building situated within a four-acre compound, had been completed only in September. At 02:45 it was attacked by a 19-man sapper team that blew a hole in the surrounding wall and charged through. With their officers killed in the initial attack and their attempt to gain access to the building having failed, the sappers simply occupied the chancery grounds until they were all killed or captured by U.S. reinforcements that were landed on the roof of the building six hours later. By 09:20 the embassy and grounds were secured, with the loss of five U.S. personnel.

At 03:00 on 31 January, 12 VC sappers approached the Vietnamese Navy Headquarters in two civilian cars, killing two guards at a barricade at Me Linh Square and then advanced towards the base gate. The sound of gunfire alerted base sentries, who secured the gate and sounded the alarm. A .30-caliber machine gun on the second floor of the headquarters disabled both cars and killed or wounded several sappers while the Navy security force organized a counterattack. Simultaneously a U.S. Navy advisor contacted the U.S. military police who soon attacked the VC from adjoining streets, the resulting crossfire ended the attack, killing eight sappers with two captured.
Small squads of VC fanned out across the city to attack various officers and enlisted men&#x27;s billets, homes of ARVN officers, and district police stations. Provided with &quot;blacklists&quot; of military officers and civil servants, they began to round up and execute any that could be found.

On 1 February, General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, chief of the National Police, publicly executed VC officer Nguyễn Văn Lém in front of photographer Eddie Adams and a film cameraman. That photograph, with the title &quot;Saigon Execution&quot;, won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and is widely seen as a defining moment in the Vietnam War for its influence on U.S. public opinion, even being called &quot;the picture that lost the war&quot;.

Outside the city proper, two VC battalions attacked the U.S. logistical and headquarters complex at Long Binh Post. Biên Hòa Air Base was struck by a battalion, while the adjacent ARVN III Corps headquarters was the objective of another. Tan Son Nhut Air Base, in the northwestern part of the city, was attacked by three battalions. A combat-ready battalion of ARVN paratroopers, awaiting transport to Da Nang, went instead directly into action supporting the United States Air Force&#x27;s 377th Security Police Squadron and the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment in halting the attack. A total of 35 PAVN/VC battalions, many of whose troops were undercover cadres who had lived and worked within the capital or its environs for years, had been committed to the Saigon objectives. By dawn most of the attacks within the city center had been eliminated, but severe fighting between VC and allied forces erupted in the Chinese neighborhood of Cholon around the Phú Thọ racetrack, southwest of the city center, which was being used as a staging area and command and control center by the PAVN/VC. Bitter and destructive house-to-house fighting erupted in the area. On 4 February, the residents were ordered to leave their homes and the area was declared a free fire zone. Fighting in the city came to a close only after a fierce battle between the ARVN Rangers and PAVN forces on 7 March.

On the morning of 2 March 1968, while patrolling north of Tan Son Nhut Air Base near the small village of Quoi Xuan to locate VC rocket sites, Company C, 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment walked into an ambush losing 48 killed in just eight minutes. U.S. forces claimed they killed 20 VC. Specialist Nicholas J. Cutinha would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Quoi Xuan. General Fillmore K. Mearns would describe this as &quot;a classic example of a properly executed ambush.&quot; The following day as US troops swept the area they were engaged by VC forces in an eight-hour battle losing three dead while killing 10 VC.

While their attacks on Saigon had been quickly repulsed, in early March, more than 20 VC battalions remained near Gia Định Province, threatening Saigon. While most of these units had suffered heavy losses in the offensive, their continued presence applied pressure on Saigon and prevented the reestablishment of South Vietnamese Government control. From 11 March to 7 April, Allied forces launched Operation Quyet Thang to pacify the area around Saigon. The operation was considered a success and the U.S. claimed 2,658 VC killed and 427 captured. It was followed immediately by Operation Toan Thang I (8 April – 31 May), which expanded the security operation across III Corps and resulted in a further 7,645 VC killed and 1,708 captured for South Vietnamese losses of 708 killed, U.S. losses of 564 killed and other Allied losses of 23 killed.

===Huế===


At 03:40 on the foggy morning of 31 January, allied defensive positions north of the Hương River in the city of Huế were mortared and rocketed and then attacked by two battalions of the PAVN 6th Regiment. Their target was the ARVN 1st Division headquarters located in the Citadel, a three-square mile complex of palaces, parks, and residences, which were surrounded by a moat and a massive earth and masonry fortress. The undermanned ARVN defenders, led by General Ngô Quang Trưởng, managed to hold their position, but the majority of the Citadel fell to the PAVN. On the south bank of the river, the PAVN 4th Regiment attempted to seize the local MACV headquarters, but was held at bay by a makeshift force of approximately 200 Americans. The rest of the city was overrun by PAVN forces that initially totaled approximately 7,500 men. Both sides then rushed to reinforce and resupply their forces. Lasting 25 days, the battle of Huế became one of the longest and bloodiest single battles of the Vietnam War.

During the first days of the North Vietnamese occupation, U.S. intelligence vastly underestimated the number of PAVN troops and little appreciated the effort that was going to be necessary to evict them. Westmoreland informed the Joint Chiefs that &quot;the enemy has approximately three companies in the Huế Citadel and the marines have sent a battalion into the area to clear them out.&quot; A later assessment ultimately noted three Marine and 11 Vietnamese battalions engaged at least 8 PAVN/VC battalions of the PAVN 6th Regiment, not including the large number of forces outside the city.

Since there were no U.S. formations stationed in Huế, relief forces had to move up from Phu Bai Combat Base, eight kilometers to the southeast. In a misty drizzle, U.S. Marines of the 1st Marine Division and soldiers of the 1st ARVN Division and Marine Corps cleared the city street by street and house by house, a deadly and destructive form of urban combat that the U.S. military had not engaged in since the Battle of Seoul during the Korean War, and for which neither side was trained. Because of poor weather conditions, logistics problems and the historical and cultural significance of the city, American forces did not immediately apply air and artillery strikes as widely as they had in other cities.
VC forces around Huế included six main-force battalions, while two PAVN regiments operated in the area. As the battle unfolded three more PAVN regiments redeployed from Khe Sanh arrived as reinforcements. The North Vietnamese plan of attack on Huế involved intensive preparation and reconnaissance. Over 190 targets, including every government and military installation on both sides of the river would be hit on January 31 by a force of five thousand. Other forces would block American and ARVN reinforcement routes, mainly Highway 1. Over half of the ARVN 1st Division was on holiday leave and PAVN commanders believed the population of Huế would join the fight as a part of the General Uprising.

Outside Huế, elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and the 101st Airborne Division fought to seal PAVN access and cut off their lines of supply and reinforcement. By this point in the battle 16 to 18 PAVN battalions (8,000–11,000 men) were taking part in the fighting for the city itself or the approaches to the city. Two of the PAVN regiments had made a forced march from the vicinity of Khe Sanh to Huế to participate. During most of February, the allies gradually fought their way towards the Citadel, which was taken only after 25 days of intense struggle. The city was not declared recaptured by U.S. and ARVN forces until 25 February, when members of the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 1st Division raised the South Vietnamese flag over the Palace of Perfect Peace.

During the intense action, the allies estimated that PAVN forces had between 1,042 and 5,000 killed and 89 captured in the city and in the surrounding area. 216 U.S. Marines and soldiers had been killed during the fighting and 1,609 were wounded. 421 ARVN troops were killed, another 2,123 were wounded, and 31 were missing. More than 5,800 civilians had lost their lives during the battle and 116,000 were left homeless out of an original population of 140,000. 40–50% of Huế was destroyed by the end of the battle.

In the aftermath of the recapture of the city, the discovery of several mass graves (the last of which were uncovered in 1970) of South Vietnamese citizens of Huế sparked a controversy that has not diminished with time. The victims had either been clubbed or shot to death or simply buried alive. The official allied explanation was that during their initial occupation of the city, the PAVN had quickly begun to systematically round up (under the guise of re-education) and then execute as many as 2,800 South Vietnamese civilians that they believed to be potentially hostile to communist control. Those taken into custody included South Vietnamese military personnel, present and former government officials, local civil servants, teachers, policemen, and religious figures. Historian Gunther Lewy claimed that a captured VC document stated that the communists had &quot;eliminated 1,892 administrative personnel, 38 policemen, 790 tyrants.&quot; The North Vietnamese officer, Bùi Tín, later further muddied the waters by stating that their forces had indeed rounded up &quot;reactionary&quot; captives for transport to the North, but that local commanders, under battlefield exigencies, had executed them for expediency&#x27;s sake.

Trưởng believed that the captives had been executed by the communists to protect the identities of members of the local VC infrastructure, whose covers had been blown. The exact circumstances leading to the deaths of those citizens of Huế discovered in the mass graves may never be known exactly, but most of the victims were killed as a result of PAVN and VC executions, considering evidence from captured documents and witness testimonies among other things.

===Khe Sanh===

The attack on Khe Sanh, which began on 21 January before the other offensives, probably served two purposes—as a real attempt to seize the position or as a diversion to draw American attention and forces away from the population centers in the lowlands, a deception that was &quot;both plausible and easy to orchestrate.&quot; In Westmoreland&#x27;s view, the purpose of the base was to provoke the North Vietnamese into a focused and prolonged confrontation in a confined geographic area, one that would allow the application of massive U.S. artillery and air strikes that would inflict heavy casualties in a relatively unpopulated region. By the end of 1967, MACV had moved nearly half of its manoeuvre battalions to I Corps in anticipation of just such a battle.

Westmoreland—and the American media, which covered the action extensively—often made inevitable comparisons between the actions at Khe Sanh and the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, where a French base had been besieged and ultimately overrun by Viet Minh forces under the command of General Giáp during the First Indochina War. Westmoreland, who knew of Nguyen Chi Thanh&#x27;s penchant for large-scale operations—but not of his death—believed that this was going to be an attempt to replicate that victory. He intended to stage his own &quot;Dien Bien Phu in reverse.&quot;

Khe Sanh and its 6,000 U.S. Marine Corps, Army and ARVN defenders was surrounded by two to three PAVN divisions, totaling approximately 20,000 men. Throughout the siege, which lasted until 8 April, the allies were subjected to heavy mortar, rocket, and artillery bombardment, combined with sporadic small-scale infantry attacks on outlying positions. With the exception of the overrunning of the U.S. Special Forces camp at Lang Vei, however, there was never a major ground assault on the base and the battle became largely a duel between American and North Vietnamese artillerists, combined with massive air strikes conducted by U.S. aircraft. By the end of the siege, U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy aircraft had dropped 39,179 tons of ordnance in the defense of the base.

The overland supply route to the base had been cut off, and airborne resupply by cargo aircraft became extremely dangerous due to heavy PAVN antiaircraft fire. Thanks to innovative high-speed &quot;Super Gaggles&quot;, which used fighter-bombers in combination with large numbers of supply helicopters, and the Air Force&#x27;s use of C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft employing the innovative LAPES delivery method, aerial resupply was never halted.

When the Tet offensive began, feelings ran high at MACV that the base was in for a serious attack. In I Corps, the Tet Truce had been cancelled in apprehension of a communist assault that never happened. The offensive passed Khe Sanh by and the intermittent battle continued. Westmoreland&#x27;s fixation upon the base continued even as the battle raged around him in Saigon. On 1 February, as the offensive reached its height, he wrote a memo for his staff—which was never delivered—stating: &quot;The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue ... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone&#x27;s attention from the area of greatest threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused.&quot;

In the end, a major allied relief expedition (Operation Pegasus) launched by all three brigades of the 1st Cavalry Division reached Khe Sanh on 8 April, but PAVN forces were already withdrawing from the area. Both sides claimed that the battle had served its intended purpose. MACV estimated that 5,500 PAVN troops had been killed and considerably more wounded. During the entire battle from 1 November 1967 to 14 April 1968, 730 U.S. personnel were killed and another 2,642 wounded. Khe Sanh Base was later closed on 5 July 1968 because the base was seen as having less of a strategic importance than before.

==Aftermath==
Except at Huế and mopping-up operations in and around Saigon, the first surge of the offensive was over by the second week of February. The U.S. estimated that during the first phase (30 January – 8 April) approximately 45,000 PAVN/VC soldiers were killed and an unknown number were wounded. For years this figure has been held as excessively optimistic, as it represented more than half the forces involved in this battle. Stanley Karnow claims he confirmed this figure in Hanoi in 1981. Westmoreland himself claimed a smaller number of enemies disabled, estimating that during the same period 32,000 PAVN troops were killed and another 5,800 captured. The South Vietnamese suffered 2,788 killed, 8,299 wounded, and 587 missing in action. U.S. and other allied forces suffered 1,536 killed, 7,764 wounded, and 11 missing.

===North Vietnam===
The leadership in Hanoi was despondent at the outcome of their offensive. Their first and most ambitious goal, producing a general uprising, had ended in a dismal failure. In total, about 85,000–100,000 PAVN/VC troops had participated in the initial onslaught and in the follow-up phases. Overall, during the &quot;Border Battles&quot; of 1967 and the nine-month winter-spring campaign, 45,267 PAVN/VC troops had been killed in action.

Hanoi had underestimated the strategic mobility of the allied forces, and made incorrect assumptions upon which the entire campaign was based, allowing them to redeploy at will to threatened areas. Their battle plan was also too complex and difficult to coordinate, which was amply demonstrated by the 30 January attacks, which demonstrated their violation of the principle of mass - attacking everywhere instead of concentrating their forces on a few specific targets - allowing their forces to be defeated piecemeal, with PAVN/VC forces launching massed attacks directly towards an enemy with vastly superior firepower. According to Tra: &quot;We did not correctly evaluate the specific balance of forces between ourselves and the enemy, did not fully realize that the enemy still had considerable capabilities, and that our capabilities were limited, and set requirements that were beyond our actual strength.&quot;

The PAVN/VC effort to regain control of the countryside was somewhat more successful. According to the U.S. State Department, the VC &quot;made pacification virtually inoperative. In the Mekong Delta, the Viet Cong was stronger now than ever and in other regions the countryside belongs to the VC.&quot; Wheeler reported that the offensive had brought counterinsurgency programs to a halt and &quot;that to a large extent, the VC now controlled the countryside&quot;. This state of affairs did not last; heavy casualties and the backlash of the South Vietnamese and Americans resulted in more territorial losses and heavy casualties.

The heavy losses inflicted on VC units struck into the heart of the infrastructure that had been built up for over a decade: MACV estimated that 181,149 PAVN/VC troops had been killed during 1968. According to General Tran Van Tra, 45,267 PAVN/VC troops had been killed during 1968. Marilyn B. Young writes:

In Long An province, for example, local guerrillas taking part in the May—June offensive had been divided into several sections. Only 775 out of 2,018 in one section survived; another lost all but 640 out of 1,430. The province itself was subjected to what one historian has called a &quot;My Lai from the Sky&quot;—non-stop B-52 bombing.

From this point forward, Hanoi was forced to fill nearly 70% of the VC&#x27;s ranks with PAVN regulars. PRG Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng said that the Tet offensive had wiped out half of the VC&#x27;s strength, while the official Vietnamese war history notes that by the end of 1969, very little communist-held territory (&quot;liberated zones&quot;) existed in &quot;the rural lowlands of Cochin China.&quot; Following the Tet offensive and subsequent U.S.–South Vietnamese &quot;search and hold&quot; operations in the countryside throughout the rest of 1968, the VC&#x27;s recruiting base was more or less wiped out; the official Vietnamese war history later noted that &quot;we could not maintain the level of local recruitment we had maintained in previous years. In 1969 we were only able to recruit 1,700 new soldiers in Region 5 (compared with 8,000 in 1968), and in the lowlands of Cochin China we recruited only 100 new soldiers (compared with 16,000 in 1968).&quot; As also noted by the official history, &quot;because our armed local forces had suffered severe losses, guerrilla operations had declined.&quot; However, this change had little effect on the overall result of the war, since in contrast to the VC, the PAVN had little difficulty making up the casualties inflicted by the offensive. Some Western historians have come to believe that one insidious ulterior motive for the campaign was the elimination of competing southern members of the Party, thereby allowing the northerners more control once the war was won.

It was not until after the conclusion of the first phase of the offensive that Hanoi realized that its sacrifices might not have been in vain. General Tran Do, PAVN commander at the battle of Huế, gave some insight into how defeat was translated into victory:

On 5 May, Trường Chinh rose to address a congress of Party members and proceeded to castigate the Party militants and their bid for quick victory: his &quot;faction-bashing&quot; tirade sparked a serious debate within the party leadership that lasted for four months. As the leader of the &quot;main force war&quot; and &quot;quick victory&quot; faction, Lê Duẩn also came under severe criticism. 

In August, Chinh&#x27;s report on the situation was accepted &quot;in toto&quot;, published, and broadcast via Radio Hanoi, single-handedly shifting the nation&#x27;s war strategy and restoring himself to prominence as the Party&#x27;s ideological conscience. 

The Lê Duẩn faction, which favoured quick, decisive offensives meant to paralyse South Vietnam-United States responses, was replaced by Giáp and Trường Chinh, who favoured a strategy of more protracted, drawn-out conventional warfare. High-intensity, conventional big-unit battles were replaced with smaller-scale, quick attack and quick withdrawal operations to continually put pressure on the allied forces at the same time that mechanised and combined-arms capabilities were being built. The plan for a popular uprising or people&#x27;s war was abandoned for a greater combination of guerrilla and conventional warfare. During this period, the PAVN would undergo a significant strategic re-structuring, being built into a combined-arms capable force while continually applying pressure on the U.S./ARVN with lighter infantry units. In line with the revamped strategy of Hanoi, on April 5, 1969, COSVN issued &quot;Directive 55&quot; to all of its subordinate units: &quot;Never again and under no circumstances are we going to risk our entire military force for just such an offensive. On the contrary, we should endeavor to preserve our military potential for future campaigns.&quot;

The PAVN official history describes the first phase of the Tet offensive as a &quot;great strategic victory&quot; that &quot;killed or dispersed 150,000 enemy soldiers including 43,000 Americans, destroyed 34 percent of the American war reserve supplies in Vietnam, destroyed 4,200 strategic hamlets and liberated an additional 1.4 million people.&quot;

===South Vietnam===
South Vietnam was a nation in turmoil both during and in the aftermath of the offensive. Tragedy had compounded tragedy as the conflict reached into the nation&#x27;s cities for the first time. As government troops pulled back to defend the urban areas, the VC moved in to fill the vacuum in the countryside. The violence and destruction witnessed during the offensive left a deep psychological scar on the South Vietnamese civilian population. Confidence in the government was shaken, since the offensive seemed to reveal that even with massive American support, the government could not protect its citizens.

A political rivalry had also re-emerged after the 1967 South Vietnamese presidential election, when the coalition between Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Air Force commander Nguyễn Cao Kỳ re-emerged. Kỳ would be sidelined by Thiệu for the duration of the war afterwards, retaining his position as Vice President.

The human and material cost to South Vietnam was staggering. The number of civilian dead was estimated by the government at 14,300 with an additional 24,000 wounded. 630,000 new refugees had been generated, joining the nearly 800,000 others already displaced by the war. By the end of 1968, one of every twelve South Vietnamese was living in a refugee camp. More than 70,000 homes had been destroyed in the fighting and perhaps 30,000 more were heavily damaged and the nation&#x27;s infrastructure had been virtually destroyed. The South Vietnamese military, although it had performed better than the Americans had expected, suffered from lowered morale, with desertion rates rising from 10.5 per thousand before Tet to 16.5 per thousand by July. 1968 became the deadliest year of the war to date for the ARVN with 27,915 men killed.

In the wake of the offensive, however, fresh determination was exhibited by the Thiệu government. On 1 February Thiệu declared a state of martial law, and on 15 June, the National Assembly passed his request for a general mobilization of the population and the induction of 200,000 draftees into the armed forces by the end of the year (a decree that had failed to pass only five months previously due to strong political opposition). This increase would bring South Vietnam&#x27;s troop strength to more than 900,000 men. Military mobilization, anti-corruption campaigns, demonstrations of political unity, and administrative reforms were quickly carried out. Thiệu also established a National Recovery Committee to oversee food distribution, resettlement, and housing construction for the new refugees. Both the government and the Americans were encouraged by a new determination that was exhibited among the ordinary citizens of South Vietnam. Many urban dwellers were indignant that the communists had launched their attacks during Tet, and it drove many who had been previously apathetic into active support of the government. Journalists, political figures, and religious leaders alike—even the militant Buddhists—professed confidence in the government&#x27;s plans.

Thiệu saw an opportunity to consolidate his personal power and he took it. His only real political rival was Kỳ, who had been outmaneuvered by Thiệu in the presidential election of 1967. In the aftermath of Tet, Kỳ supporters in the military and the administration were quickly removed from power, arrested, or exiled. A crack-down on the South Vietnamese press also ensued and there was a worrisome return of former President Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s Cần Lao Party members to high positions in the government and military. By the summer of 1968, Thiệu had earned a less exalted sobriquet among the South Vietnamese population, who had begun to call him &quot;the little dictator.&quot;

Thiệu had also become very suspicious of his American allies, unwilling to believe (as did many South Vietnamese) that the U.S. had been caught by surprise by the offensive. &quot;Now that it&#x27;s all over&quot;, he queried a visiting Washington official, &quot;you really knew it was coming, didn&#x27;t you?&quot; Johnson&#x27;s unilateral decision on 31 March to curtail the bombing of North Vietnam only confirmed what Thiệu already feared, that the Americans were going to abandon South Vietnam to the communists. For Thiệu, the bombing halt and the beginning of negotiations with the North brought not the hope of an end to the war, but &quot;an abiding fear of peace.&quot; He was only mollified after an 18 July meeting with Johnson in Honolulu, where Johnson affirmed that Saigon would be a full partner in all negotiations and that the U.S. would not &quot;support the imposition of a coalition government, or any other form of government, on the people of South Vietnam.&quot;

===United States===

The Tet Offensive created a crisis within the Johnson administration, which became increasingly unable to convince the American public that it had been a major defeat for the communists. The optimistic assessments made before the offensive by the administration and the Pentagon came under heavy criticism and ridicule as the &quot;credibility gap&quot; that had opened in 1967 widened into a chasm.

At the time of the Tet Offensive, the majority of the American public perceived that the war was not being won by the United States and its allies, despite assurances from the President and military leaders that such was the case. No matter that the PAVN/VC lost about 30,000 of their best troops in the fighting at Tet, they were capable of replacing those lost with recruits from North Vietnam. In 1969, the year after the Tet battles, the US suffered 11,780 killed, the second highest annual total in the war. This was a clear indication that the North Vietnamese were capable of ongoing offensive actions, despite their losses at Tet. Most Americans were tired of suffering so many casualties without evidence that they were going to stop anytime in the foreseeable future. Walter Cronkite, anchorman of the CBS Evening News, argued for negotiations as an honourable way out in a Special Report based on his journalism in Vietnam broadcast on CBS TV in March.

The shocks that reverberated from the battlefield continued to widen: On 18 February 1968 MACV posted the highest U.S. casualty figures for a single week during the entire war: 543 killed and 2,547 wounded. As a result of the heavy fighting, 1968 went on to become the deadliest year of the war for the US forces with 16,592 soldiers killed. On 23 February the U.S. Selective Service System announced a new draft call for 48,000 men, the second highest of the war. On 28 February Robert S. McNamara, the Secretary of Defense who had overseen the escalation of the war in 1964–1965, but who had eventually turned against it, stepped down from office.

====Troop request====
During the first two weeks of February, Generals Westmoreland and Wheeler communicated as to the necessity for reinforcements or troop increases in Vietnam. Westmoreland insisted that he only needed those forces either in-country or already scheduled for deployment and he was puzzled by the sense of unwarranted urgency in Wheeler&#x27;s queries. Westmoreland was tempted, however, when Wheeler emphasized that the White House might loosen restraints and allow operations in Laos, Cambodia, or possibly even North Vietnam itself. On 8 February, Westmoreland responded that he could use another division &quot;if operations in Laos are authorized&quot;. Wheeler responded by challenging Westmoreland&#x27;s assessment of the situation, pointing out dangers that his on-the-spot commander did not consider palpable, concluding: &quot;In summary, if you need more troops, ask for them.&quot;

Wheeler&#x27;s promptings were influenced by the severe strain imposed upon the U.S. military by the Vietnam commitment, which had been undertaken without mobilizing its reserve forces. The Joint Chiefs had repeatedly requested national mobilization, not only to prepare for a possible intensification of the war but also to ensure that the nation&#x27;s strategic reserve did not become depleted. By obliquely ordering Westmoreland to demand more forces, Wheeler was attempting to solve two pressing problems. In comparison with MACV&#x27;s previous communications, which had been full of confidence, optimism, and resolve, Westmoreland&#x27;s 12 February request for 10,500 troops was much more urgent: &quot;which I desperately need ... time is of the essence&quot;. On 13 February, 10,500 previously authorized U.S. airborne troops and marines were dispatched to South Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs then played their hand, advising President Johnson to turn down MACV&#x27;s requested division-sized reinforcement unless he called up some 1,234,001 marine and army reservists.

Johnson dispatched Wheeler to Saigon on 20 February to determine military requirements in response to the offensive. Both Wheeler and Westmoreland were elated that McNamara would be replaced by the hawkish Clark Clifford in only eight days and that the military might finally obtain permission to widen the war. Wheeler&#x27;s written report of the trip, however, contained no mention of any new contingencies, strategies, or the building up of the strategic reserve. It was couched in grave language that suggested that the 206,756-man request it proposed was a matter of vital military necessity. Westmoreland wrote in his memoir that Wheeler had deliberately concealed the truth of the matter to force the issue of the strategic reserve upon the President.

On 27 February, Johnson and McNamara discussed the proposed troop increase. To fulfil it would require an increase in the overall military strength of about 400,000 men and the expenditure of an additional $10 billion during fiscal 1969 and another $15 billion in 1970. These monetary concerns were pressing. Throughout the fall of 1967 and the spring of 1968, the U.S. was struggling with &quot;one of the most severe monetary crises&quot; of the period. Without a new tax bill and budgetary cuts, the nation would face even higher inflation &quot;and the possible collapse of the monetary system&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s friend Clifford was concerned about what the American public would think of the escalation: &quot;How do we avoid creating the feeling that we are pounding troops down a rathole?&quot;

According to the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, &quot;A fork in the road had been reached and the alternatives stood out in stark reality.&quot; To meet Wheeler&#x27;s request would mean a total U.S. military commitment to South Vietnam. &quot;To deny it, or to attempt to cut it to a size which could be sustained by the thinly stretched active forces, would just as surely signify that an upper limit to the U.S. military commitment in South Vietnam had been reached.&quot;

====Reassessment====
To evaluate Westmoreland&#x27;s request and its possible impact on domestic politics, Johnson convened the &quot;Clifford Group&quot; on 28 February and tasked its members with a complete policy reassessment. Some of the members argued that the offensive represented an opportunity to defeat the North Vietnamese on American terms while others pointed out that neither side could win militarily, that North Vietnam could match any troop increase, that the bombing of the North is halted, and that a change in strategy was required that would seek not victory, but the staying power required to reach a negotiated settlement. This would require a less aggressive strategy that was designed to protect the population of South Vietnam. The divided group&#x27;s final report, issued on 4 March, &quot;failed to seize the opportunity to change directions... and seemed to recommend that we continue rather haltingly down the same road.&quot;

On 1 March, Clifford succeeded McNamara as Secretary of Defense. During the month, Clifford, who had entered office as a staunch supporter of the Vietnam commitment and who had opposed McNamara&#x27;s de-escalatory views, turned against the war. According to Clifford: &quot;The simple truth was that the military failed to sustain a respectable argument for their position.&quot; Between the results of Tet and the meetings of the group that bore his name, he became convinced that deescalation was the only solution for the United States. He believed that the troop increase would lead only to a more violent stalemate and sought out others in the administration to assist him in convincing the President to reverse the escalation, cap force levels at 550,000 men, seek negotiations with Hanoi, and turn responsibility for the fighting over to the South Vietnamese. Clifford quietly sought allies and was assisted in his effort by the so-called &quot;8:30 Group&quot;—Nitze, Warnke, Phil G. Goulding (Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs), George Elsey and Air Force Colonel Robert E. Pursely.

On 27 February, Secretary of State Dean Rusk proposed that a partial bombing halt be implemented in North Vietnam and that an offer to negotiate be extended to Hanoi. On 4 March, Rusk reiterated the proposal, explaining that, during the rainy season in the North, the bombing was less effective and that no military sacrifice would thus occur. This was purely a political ploy, however, since the North Vietnamese would probably again refuse to negotiate, casting the onus on them and &quot;thus freeing our hand after a short period...putting the monkey firmly upon Hanoi&#x27;s back for what was to follow.&quot;

While this was being deliberated, the troop request was leaked to the press and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 10 March. The article also revealed that the request had begun a serious debate within the administration. According to it, many high-level officials believed that the U.S. troop increase would be matched by the communists and would simply maintain a stalemate at a higher level of violence. It went on to state that officials were saying in private that &quot;widespread and deep changes in attitudes, a sense that a watershed has been reached.&quot;

A great deal has been said by historians concerning how the news media made Tet the &quot;turning point&quot; in the public&#x27;s perception of the war. Popular CBS anchor Walter Cronkite stated during a news broadcast on February 27, &quot;We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds&quot; and added that, &quot;we are mired in a stalemate that could only be ended by negotiation, not victory.&quot; Far from suffering a loss of morale, however, the majority of Americans had rallied to the side of the president. A Gallup poll in January 1968 revealed that 56 per cent polled considered themselves hawks on the war and 27 per cent doves, with 17 per cent offering no opinion. By early February, at the height of the offensive&#x27;s first phase, 61 per cent declared themselves hawks, 23 per cent doves, and 16 per cent held no opinion. 

Johnson, however, made few comments to the press during or immediately after the offensive, leaving an impression of indecision on the public, and it was this lack of communication that caused a collapse in his approval rating for his conduct of the war: by the end of February, his approval rating had fallen from 63 per cent to 47 per cent. By the end of March, the percentage of Americans that expressed confidence in U.S. military policies in Southeast Asia had fallen from 74 per cent to 54 per cent.

By 22 March, Johnson had informed Kentrell to &quot;forget the 100,000&quot; men. The President and his staff were refining a lesser version of the troop increase—a planned call-up of 62,000 reservists, 13,000 of whom would be sent to Vietnam. Three days later, at Clifford&#x27;s suggestion, Johnson called a conclave of the &quot;Wise Men&quot;. With few exceptions, all of the members of the group had formerly been accounted as hawks on the war. The group was joined by Rusk, Wheeler, Bundy, Rostow and Clifford. The final assessment of the majority stupefied the group. According to Clifford, &quot;few of them were thinking solely of Vietnam anymore&quot;. All but four members called for disengagement from the war, leaving the President &quot;deeply shaken.&quot; According to the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, the advice of the group was decisive in convincing Johnson to reduce the bombing of North Vietnam.

Johnson was depressed and despondent in the course of recent events: the &quot;New York Times&quot; article had been released just two days before the Democratic Party&#x27;s New Hampshire primary, where the President suffered an unexpected setback, finishing barely ahead of Senator Eugene McCarthy. Soon afterwards, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced he would join the contest for the Democratic nomination, further emphasizing the plummeting support for Johnson&#x27;s administration in the wake of Tet.

Johnson was to make a televised address to the nation on Vietnam policy on 31 March and was deliberating on both the troop request and his response to the military situation. By 28 March Clifford was working with Johnson to convince him to tone down his hard-line speech, maintain force levels at their present size, and institute Rusk&#x27;s bombing/negotiating proposal. To Clifford&#x27;s surprise, both Rusk and Rostow (both of whom had previously been opposed to any form of de-escalation) offered no opposition to Clifford&#x27;s suggestions. On 31 March, Johnson announced the unilateral (although still partial) bombing halt during his television address, then stunned the nation by declining to run for a second term in office. To Washington&#x27;s surprise, on 3 April Hanoi announced that it would conduct negotiations, which were scheduled to begin on 13 May in Paris.

On 9 June, Johnson replaced Westmoreland as commander of MACV with General Creighton W. Abrams. Although the decision had been made in December 1967 and Westmoreland was made Army Chief of Staff, many saw his relief as punishment for the entire Tet debacle. Abrams&#x27; new strategy was quickly demonstrated by the closure of the &quot;strategic&quot; Khe Sanh base and the ending of multi-division &quot;search and destroy&quot; operations, along with discussions of victory over North Vietnam. Abrams&#x27; new &quot;One War&quot; policy centred the American effort on the takeover of the fighting by the South Vietnamese (through Vietnamization), the pacification of the countryside, and the destruction of communist logistics. The new administration of President Richard M. Nixon would oversee the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the continuation of negotiations.

===Phase II===

To further enhance their political posture at the Paris talks, which opened on 13 May, the North Vietnamese opened the second phase of the general offensive in late April. U.S. intelligence sources estimated between February and May the North Vietnamese dispatched 50,000 men down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to replace losses incurred during the earlier fighting. Some of the most prolonged and vicious combat of the war opened on 29 April and lasted until 30 May when the 8,000 men of the PAVN 320th Division, backed by artillery from across the DMZ, threatened the U.S. logistical base at Đông Hà, in northwestern Quảng Trị Province. In what became known as the Battle of Dai Do, the PAVN clashed savagely with U.S. Marine, Army and ARVN forces before withdrawing. The PAVN lost an estimated 2,100 men according to US/ARVN claims, after inflicting casualties on the allies of 290 killed and 946 wounded.


During the early morning hours of 4 May, PAVN/VC units initiated the second phase of the offensive (known by the South Vietnamese and Americans as &quot;Mini-Tet&quot;) by striking 119 targets throughout South Vietnam, including Saigon. This time, however, allied intelligence was better prepared, stripping away the element of surprise. Most of the communist forces were intercepted by allied screening elements before they reached their targets. 13 VC battalions, however, managed to slip through the cordon and once again plunged the capital into chaos. Severe fighting occurred at Phu Lam, (where it took two days to root out the VC 267th Local Force Battalion), around the Y-Bridge and at Tan Son Nhut. By 12 May, however, it was all over. VC forces withdrew from the area leaving behind over 3,000 dead.

The fighting had no sooner died down around Saigon than U.S. forces in Quảng Tín Province suffered a defeat when the PAVN 2nd Division attacked Kham Duc, the last Special Forces border surveillance camp in I Corps. 1,800 U.S. and ARVN troops were isolated and under intense attack when MACV made the decision to avoid a situation reminiscent of that at Khe Sanh. Kham Duc was evacuated by air while under fire and abandoned to the North Vietnamese.
The PAVN/VC returned to Saigon on 25 May and launched a second wave of attacks on the city. The fighting during this phase differed from &quot;Tet Mau Than&quot; and &quot;Mini-Tet&quot; in that no U.S. installations were attacked. During this series of actions, VC forces occupied six Buddhist pagodas in the mistaken belief that they would be immune from artillery and air attack. The fiercest fighting once again took place in Cholon. One notable event occurred on 18 June when 152 members of the VC &quot;Quyet Thang&quot; Regiment surrendered to ARVN forces, the largest communist surrender of the war. The actions also brought more death and suffering to the city&#x27;s inhabitants. A further 87,000 were made homeless while more than 500 were killed and another 4,500 were wounded. During part of the second phase (5 May – 30 May) U.S. casualties amounted to 1,161 killed and 3,954 wounded,

===Phase III===

Phase III of the offensive began on 17 August and involved attacks in I, II and III Corps. Significantly, during this series of actions only North Vietnamese forces participated and targets were military in nature, with less concise attacks against city-targets. The main offensive was preceded by attacks on the border towns of Tây Ninh, An Lộc, and Loc Ninh, which were initiated to draw defensive forces from the cities. A thrust against Da Nang was preempted by the U.S. Marines&#x27; Operation Allen Brook. Continuing their border-clearing operations, three PAVN regiments asserted heavy pressure on the U.S. Special Forces camp at Bu Prang, in Quang Duc Province, five kilometers from the Cambodian border. The fighting lasted for two days before the PAVN broke contact; the combat resulted in US/ARVN claiming 776 PAVN/VC casualties, 114 South Vietnamese and two Americans.

Saigon was struck again during this phase, but the attacks were less sustained and once again repulsed. As far as MACV was concerned, the August offensive &quot;was a dismal failure&quot;. In five weeks of fighting and after the loss of 20,000 troops, the previous objectives of spurring an uprising and mass-defection had not been attained during this &quot;final and decisive phase&quot;. Yet, as historian Ronald Spector has pointed out &quot;the communist failures were not final or decisive either&quot;.

The significant casualties and suffering endured by PAVN/VC units during these sustained operations were beginning to have a wider effect. The apparent lack of military gains made that could possibly justify the casualties and effort exacerbated the situation. During the first half of 1969, more than 20,000 PAVN/VC troops defected to allied forces, a threefold increase over the 1968 figure.

<doc id="218183" wikidata="Q319899" url="?curid=218183" title="Downhill (ski competition)">
<text>Downhill is a form of alpine skiing competition. Whereas the other alpine skiing events (slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined) emphasize turning and technique, downhill emphasizes &quot;the six components of technique, courage, speed, risk, physical condition and judgement&quot;, according to the FIS &quot;International Ski Competition Rules (ICR)&quot;. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed.

The term, &quot;downhill skiing&quot;, is also used as a synonym for alpine skiing as a recreational activity.

==History==
The rules for downhill skiing competitions were originally developed by Sir Arnold Lunn for the 1925 British National Ski Championships. A speed of was first achieved by Johan Clarey at the 2013 Lauberhorn World Cup, beating the previous record of , set by Italian Stefan Thanei in 2005.

==Course==
The FIS has rules for downhill courses that encompass their general characteristics, width, safety precautions, vertical drop, course length, style and placement of gates.
*&quot;General characteristics&quot; – As a test of &quot;technique, courage, speed, risk, physical condition and judgement&quot;, the course requires the athlete to adapt to the technically demanding terrain and layout of gates.
*&quot;Width&quot; – Courses are typically wide with allowances for the approaches to &quot;lips, drop-offs and jumps&quot;.
*&quot;Safety&quot; – Obstacles on courses are expected to be protected with nets, fences, or pads.
*&quot;Vertical drop&quot; – Vertical drop ranges from for men and for women. Races with two runs may be shorter.
*&quot;Course length&quot; – Courses require an accurate means of measurement for length.
*&quot;Gates&quot; – Gates consist of pairs of twin poles with a rectangular panel between the poles. Gates have an or larger opening.

==Equipment==
Equipment for the downhill is different from the alpine events that are lower-speed. Skis are 30% longer than those used in slalom, for more stability at high speed. They usually have rounded, low-profile tips rather than pointed tips. Ski poles are bent so as to curve around the body as the racer stays in a &quot;tuck position&quot; and may have aerodynamic, cone-shaped baskets. As in other alpine disciplines, downhill racers wear skin-tight suits to minimize drag, and helmets are mandatory.

In an attempt to increase safety, the 2003–2004 season saw the FIS increase the minimum sidecut radius for downhill skis to from , and impose minimum ski lengths for the first time: for men, and for women. For the 2024-2025 season, the FIS began mandating the use of an airbag device, which inflates automatically when a skier crashes, for all athletes competing in speed disciplines at the world cup level.

==Races==

In all forms of downhill, both at a local youth-level as well as the higher FIS international level, racers are allowed extensive preparation for the race, which includes daily course inspection and discussion with their coaches and teammates as well as several practice runs before the actual race. Racers do not make any unnecessary turns while on the course, and try to do everything they can to maintain the most aerodynamic position while negotiating turns and jumps.

Unlike slalom and giant slalom, where racers have the times of two runs combined, the downhill race is a single run. Times are typically between 1½ and 2½ minutes for World Cup courses and must be over 1 minute in duration to meet international minimum standards. Tenths and hundredths and, occasionally, thousandths of seconds count: World Cup races and Olympic medals have sometimes been decided by as little as one or two hundredths of a second, and ties are not unheard of.

The most successful all-time winners of World Cup downhill races are Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria (36 wins, 7 women&#x27;s titles) and Franz Klammer of Austria (25 wins, 5 men&#x27;s titles). Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. is currently dominant in woman&#x27;s downhill racing with a lifetime total of 37 World Cup downhill wins and 7 women&#x27;s titles.

==Risks==

On some courses, such as the Lauberhorn course in Wengen, Switzerland, and the Hahnenkamm course in Kitzbühel, Austria, speeds of up to are common. Safety netting and padding are placed where race officials anticipate potential crashes. Despite these safety precautions, the ski racing community is well aware of the inherent risks of downhill skiing, for it is possible for racers to suffer serious injury or death while practising or competing. Three deaths among World Cup racers in recent years in downhill training or during a race were those of Austrians Gernot Reinstadler (1991) and Ulrike Maier (1994), and Frenchman Régine Cavagnoud (2001). Also in 2001, Swiss downhiller Silvano Beltrametti was paralyzed in a high-speed crash and 1984 Olympic gold medalist Bill Johnson suffered permanent brain damage that eventually led to a crippling stroke which left him unable to function without assistance. Most recently Frenchman David Poisson was killed in a training crash in 2017. Speaking to media after Poisson&#x27;s death, French former downhiller Luc Alphand noted that &quot;eliminating risk entirely in downhill is impossible&quot;.

<text>Noresund is a small village in Krødsherad in the county of Buskerud, Norway.

Noresund is located on Lake Krøderen. Highway 7 (&quot;Riksvei 7&quot;) passes through the village. Norefjell Ski Area is located 3 kilometers northwest of Noresund. The population of Noresund is 331 (2006).

Noresund is perhaps best known for with association with the Krødsherad Rectory Natural Monument (&quot;Krødsherad prestegård naturminne&quot;). This is the site of the oak tree known as The Old Master. This tree was made famous by the poetry of clergyman and poet Jørgen Moe. In 1853 Moe became a resident chaplain in Sigdal and Krødsherad, a position he held for ten years. At Noresund he found inspiration for one of his most famous poems, &quot;The Old Master&quot; (&quot;den gamle Mester&quot;).

==The name==
The first element is the name of the farm Nore (Norse &quot;Nórar&quot;), the last element is &quot;sund&quot; n &#x27;sound, strait&#x27;. The name of the farm is the plural of &quot;nór&quot; n &#x27;narrow strait&#x27; - so the meaning of the name &quot;Noresund&quot; is &#x27;strait-strait&#x27;. The actual strait divides Lake Krøderen in two parts (Upper K. and Lower K.). The farm Nore has also given name to the mountain Norefjell.

<text>The breadbasket of a country or of a region is an area which, because of the richness of the soil and/or advantageous climate, produces large quantities of wheat or other grain. Rice bowl is a similar term used to refer to Southeast Asia; California&#x27;s Salinas Valley is sometimes referred to as America&#x27;s salad bowl. Such regions may be the subject of fierce political disputes, which may even escalate into full military conflicts.

Breadbaskets have become important within the global food system by concentrating global food-production in a small number of countries and, in countries such as India, in small geographic regions. As climate change increases weather variability around the world, the likelihood of multiple breadbaskets failing at a time increases dramatically. The 2022 food crises has been in part facilitated by a series of failures in key breadbasket regions, and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has created significant potential disruption of the respective breadbasket regions that are important for global wheat and oil seed production.

== History ==
===Classical antiquity===
Sicily and the province of Africa were considered the breadbaskets of the Roman Republic. Later, in the imperial era, Hispania (and specifically, Baetica) was considered the &quot;breadbasket of Rome.&quot; Strabo mentions that &quot;Turdetania is wonderfully fertile, it has all kinds of fruits and very abundant&quot;, and that together with province of Egypt, they are the most productive territories in the known world. Crimea was the source of a large amount of grain supplied to the Greek city-states, especially Athens.

==Africa==

In South Africa, the Free State province is often considered the country&#x27;s breadbasket due to its wheat, sunflower, and maize fields. The Overberg region in the Western Cape is also known as the breadbasket of South Africa due to its large wheat fields, as well as fruit growing.

Zimbabwe, formerly known as Rhodesia, was known as the breadbasket of Africa until 2000, exporting wheat, tobacco, and maize to the wider world, especially to other African nations. However today, Zimbabwe, is a net importer of foodstuffs from the Western World.

===Morocco===
Since subsistence agriculture was the dominant economic system in most of Morocco&#x27;s history, it&#x27;s difficult to speak of a breadbasket region. All regions produced their own wheat and barley to feed themselves and their livestock. With the European commercial penetration in the second half of the 19th century, Morocco started to export wheat to Europe despite the objection of the ulama (religious establishment). The Chaouia and Doukkala plains became the most important suppliers of wheat for export. This is logical given their proximity to the coast. The ports of Casablanca and Feddala, today&#x27;s Mohammedia, serviced the Chaouia Plain while the port of Mazagan serviced Doukkala.

After Morocco&#x27;s independence, agriculture in Doukkala became geared toward irrigation so less area has been devoted to wheat, whereas Chaouia maintained its status as a major wheat-producing region thanks to its dark soil called &quot;tirs&quot; and relatively abundant rainfall (avg. 400 mm/year).

== Europe ==


==The Americas==
===North America===

In Canada, a major grain-growing area is called the Canadian prairies. Sometimes the province of Saskatchewan, also known for producing a huge supplement of potash, is further singled out from within this region as the main breadbasket of Canada.

In the United States, an important region is the Corn Belt, where maize and soybeans are major crops, which generally extends from the Great Lakes south through Missouri. Further to the west in both the United States and Canada, east of the Rocky Mountains, is the Wheat Belt, where the climate is too severe for maize or soybeans.

The Palouse region of Eastern Washington state is often referred to as the Breadbasket of the Pacific Northwest, due to its high production of cereal wheat and lentils.

During the Civil War, the Shenandoah Valley was known as the Breadbasket of the Confederacy.

Additionally, the San Joaquin Valley in California has also been called the breadbasket of the world. The San Joaquin Valley produces the majority of the 12.8% of the United States&#x27; agricultural production (as measured by dollar value) that comes from California. Grapes—table, raisin, and, to a lesser extent, wine—are perhaps the valley&#x27;s highest-profile product, but equally (if not more) important are cotton, nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), citrus, and vegetables. 70% of the world&#x27;s and 100% of the U.S. supply of almonds comes from the valley. Oranges, peaches, garlic, tangerines, tomatoes, kiwis, hay, alfalfa and numerous other crops have been harvested with great success. According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture&#x27;s ranking of market value of agricultural products sold, nine of the nation&#x27;s top 10, and 12 of the top 20, producing counties are in California.

=== South America ===

Brazil is the second biggest grain exporter in the world, with 19% of the international market share, and the fourth grain producer country (rice, barley, soybeans, corn and wheat) behind the United States, China and India. Brazil is also the top global exporter of soybeans, sugarcane, orange juice, coffee, poultry, beef, maize, and the second biggest exporter of pork and cotton. The country also has a significant presence as producer and exporter of rice, wheat, eggs, cocoa, beans, nuts, and diverse fruits and vegetables. 

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Argentina was known as the &quot;breadbasket of the world&quot;, due to the importance that agriculture had, and still has, in the country. Argentina&#x27;s cereal cultivation is found in the Pampas region, which encompasses the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba and La Pampa. Within this region, many cities, such as Pergamino, Venado Tuerto and Rosario, are one of the most fertile areas in the continent. Some of the plantations include soybeans, maize, wheat, barley, sunflower and peanut, among others.

In the 19th century, access to the Californian and Australian markets made wheat export a very lucrative activity, leading to the Chilean wheat cycle. In the mid-19th century, those countries experienced large gold rushes, which created a large demand for wheat. Chile was at the time the &quot;only wheat producer of some importance in the Pacific&quot;.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
The Murray-Darling Basin is seen as Australia&#x27;s breadbasket, being the source of 40% of the nation&#x27;s agricultural income, a third of the wheat harvest, 95 percent of the rice crop and other products such as fruit, wine and cotton.

===New Zealand===
When New Zealand became a British colony, the fertile lands produced food that would be shipped back to England, causing New Zealand to become colloquially known (occasionally along with Australia) as Britain&#x27;s breadbasket, subsequently leading to the &quot;Dunedin&quot; being the first ship to complete a truly successful transport of refrigerated meat. She was refitted with a refrigeration machine with which she took the first load of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom.

<doc id="218197" wikidata="Q2536047" url="?curid=218197" title="Johnny Reb">
<text>Johnny Reb is the national personification of the common soldier of the Confederacy. During the American Civil War and afterwards, Johnny Reb and his Union counterpart Billy Yank were used in speech and literature to symbolize the common soldiers who fought in the Civil War in the 1860s. The symbolic image of Johnny Reb in Southern culture has been represented in its novels, poems, art, public statuary, photography, and written history. According to the historian Bell I. Wiley, who wrote about the common soldiers of the Northern and the Southern armies, the name appears to have its origins in the habit of Union soldiers calling out, &quot;Hello, Johnny&quot; or &quot;Howdy, Reb&quot; to Confederate soldiers on the other side of the picket line.

Johnny Reb is often pictured as a Confederate soldier in gray wool uniform with the typical kepi-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth or cotton jean cloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor. He is often shown as well with his weapons or with the Confederate flag, sometimes both.

&quot;Johnny Reb&quot; has been used as a nickname for veteran Confederate soldiers, as well as to refer to white natives of the states that formerly belonged to the Confederacy. The sobriquet is still commonly used in scholarly writing by Southern and Northern authors; for example, Robert N. Rosen, a Jewish native of South Carolina who has written extensively about the roles Southern Jews played in the Confederate States Army, refers to &quot;Jewish Johnny Rebs&quot;. The term &quot;Johnny Reb&quot; is still sometimes used in popular writing and in news media. In 2000, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; published an article by the historian Eric Foner entitled, &quot;Chief Johnny Reb&quot;, in reference to Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president. A 2018 book review by historian Drew Gilpin Faust appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; under the title &quot;Billy Yank and Johnny Reb&quot;.

== Use in media ==
* &quot;Johnny Reb&quot; is a Confederate soldier&#x27;s song written in 1959 by Merle Kilgore and popularized by Johnny Horton.

<doc id="218204" wikidata="Q284518" url="?curid=218204" title="IBM PS/2">
<text>The Personal System/2 or PS/2 is IBM&#x27;s second generation of personal computers. Released in 1987, it officially replaced the IBM PC, XT, AT, and PC Convertible in IBM&#x27;s lineup. Many of the PS/2&#x27;s innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1440 KB 3.5-inch floppy disk format, 72-pin SIMMs, PS/2 port, and VGA video standard, went on to become standards in the broader PC market.

The PS/2 line was created by IBM partly in an attempt to recapture control of the PC market by introducing the advanced yet proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) on higher-end models. These models were in the strange position of being incompatible with the hardware standards previously established by IBM and adopted in the IBM PC compatible industry. Most major PC manufacturers balked at IBM&#x27;s licensing terms for MCA-compatible hardware, particularly the per-machine royalties. The OS/2 operating system was announced at the same time as the PS/2 line and was intended to be the primary operating system for models with Intel 80286 or later processors. However, at the time of the first shipments, only IBM PC DOS 3.3 was available. OS/2 1.0 (text-mode only) and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 2.0 became available several months later. IBM also released AIX PS/2, a UNIX operating system for PS/2 models with Intel 386 or later processors.

IBM&#x27;s initial PS/2 computers were popular with target market corporate buyers, and by September 1988, IBM reported that it had sold 3 million PS/2 machines in the past 18 months. However, the PS/2 was unsuccessful in the consumer market since IBM failed to establish a link in the consumer&#x27;s mind between the PS/2 MicroChannel architecture and the immature OS/2 1.x operating system (the more capable OS/2 version 2.0 was not released until 1992) to justify the PS/2&#x27;s price premium, in contrast to rival IBM PC compatibles that stuck with industry-wide standard hardware while running Microsoft Windows. Rival manufacturers also teamed up to form the EISA bus standard in opposition to the Micro Channel. In 1992, &quot;Macworld&quot; stated that &quot;IBM lost control of its own market and became a minor player with its own technology.&quot; IBM officially retired the PS/2 line in July 1995.

==Technology==

IBM&#x27;s PS/2 was designed to remain software compatible with their PC/AT/XT line of computers upon which the large PC clone market was built, but the hardware was quite different. PS/2 had two BIOSes: one named ABIOS (Advanced BIOS) which provided a new protected mode interface and was used by OS/2, and CBIOS (Compatible BIOS) which was included to be software compatible with the PC/XT/AT. CBIOS was so compatible that it even included Cassette BASIC. While IBM did not publish the BIOS source code, it did promise to publish BIOS entry points.

===Micro Channel architecture===

With certain models to the IBM PS/2 line, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) was also introduced. MCA was conceptually similar to the channel architecture of the IBM System/360 mainframes. MCA was technically superior to ISA and allowed for higher-speed communications within the system. The majority of MCA&#x27;s features would be seen in later buses with the exception of: streaming-data procedure, channel-check reporting, error logging and internal bus-level video pass-through for devices like the IBM 8514. Transfer speeds were on par with the much later PCI standard. MCA allowed one-to-one, card-to-card, and multi-card to processor simultaneous transaction management which is a feature of the PCI-X bus format.

Bus mastering capability, bus arbitration, and a primitive form of plug-and-play management of hardware were all benefits of MCA. Gilbert Held in his 2000 book &quot;Server Management&quot; observes: &quot;MCA used an early (and user-hostile) version of what we know now as &#x27;Plug-N′-Play&#x27;, requiring a special setup disk for each machine and each card.&quot; MCA never gained wide acceptance outside of the PS/2.

When setting up the card with its disk, all choices for interrupts and other changes were accomplished automatically by the PC reading the old configuration from the floppy disk. This made necessary changes, then recorded the new configuration to the floppy disk. This meant that the user must keep that same floppy disk matched to that particular PC. For a small organization with a few PCs, this was annoying, but less expensive and time-consuming than bringing in a PC technician to do installation. But for large organizations with hundreds or even thousands of PCs, permanently matching each PC with its own floppy disk was a logistical nightmare. Without the original, (and correctly updated) floppy disk, no changes could be made to the PC&#x27;s cards.

===Keyboard/mouse===

====Layout====
The PS/2 IBM Model M keyboard used the same 101-key layout of the previous IBM PC/AT Extended keyboard. European variants had 102 keys with the addition of an extra key to the right of the left Shift key.

====Interface====


PS/2 systems introduced a new specification for the keyboard and mouse interfaces, which are still in use today (though increasingly supplanted by USB devices) and are thus called &quot;PS/2&quot; interfaces. The PS/2 keyboard interface, inspired by Apple&#x27;s ADB interface, was electronically identical to the long-established AT interface, but the cable connector was changed from the 5-pin DIN connector to the smaller 6-pin mini-DIN interface. The same connector and a similar synchronous serial interface was used for the PS/2 mouse port.

The initial desktop &quot;Model 50&quot; and &quot;Model 60&quot; also featured a new cableless internal design, based on use of interposer circuit boards to link the internal drives to the planar (motherboard). Additionally, these machines could be largely disassembled and reassembled for service without tools.

Additionally, the PS/2 introduced a new software data area known as the Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA). Its primary use was to add a new buffer area for the dedicated mouse port. This also required making a change to the &quot;traditional&quot; BIOS Data Area (BDA) which was then required to point to the base address of the EBDA.

Another new PS/2 innovation was the introduction of bidirectional parallel ports which, in addition to their traditional use for connecting a printer, could now function as a high-speed data transfer interface. This allowed the use of new hardware such as parallel port scanners, CD-ROM drives, and also enhanced the capabilities of printers by allowing them to communicate with the host PC and send back signals instead of simply being a passive output device.

===Graphics===
Most of the initial range of PS/2 models were equipped with a new frame buffer known as the Video Graphics Array, or VGA for short. This effectively replaced the previous EGA standard. VGA increased graphics memory to 256 KB and provided for resolutions of 640×480 with 16 colors, and with 256 colors. VGA also provided a palette of 262,144 colors (as opposed to the EGA palette of 64 colors). The IBM 8514 and later XGA computer display standards were also introduced on the PS/2 line.

Key monitors and their maximum resolutions:
*8504: 12-inch, , 60 Hz non-interlaced, 1991, monochrome
*8507: 19-inch, , 43.5 Hz interlaced, 1988, monochrome
*8511: 14-inch, , 60 Hz non-interlaced, 1987
*8512: 14-inch, , 60 Hz non-interlaced, 1987
*8513: 12-inch, , 60 Hz non-interlaced, 1987
*8514: 16-inch, , 43.5 Hz interlaced, 1987
*8515: 14-inch, , 43.5 Hz interlaced, 1991
*8516: 14-inch, , 43.5 Hz interlaced, 1991
*8518: 14-inch, , 75 Hz non-interlaced, 1992
*9515: 14-inch, , 43.5 Hz interlaced, 1992
*9517: 16-inch, , 53 Hz interlaced, 1991
*9518: 14-inch, , non-interlaced, 1992
*38F4737: 10-inch, , non-interlaced, 1989, amber monochrome plasma screen; this display was exclusive to models P70 and P75

In truth, all XGA monitors are multimode, as XGA works as an add-on card to a built-in VGA and transparently passes the VGA signal through when not operating in a high-resolution mode. All of the listed 85xx displays can therefore sync 640×480 at 60 Hz (or at 70 Hz) in addition to any higher mode they may also be capable of. This however is not true of the 95xx models (and some unlisted 85xx&#x27;s), which are specialist workstation displays designed for use with the XGA-2 or Image Adapter/A cards, and whose fixed frequencies all exceed that of basic VGA – the lowest of their commonly available modes instead being at 75 Hz, if not something much higher still. It is also worth noting that these were still merely dual- or &quot;multiple-frequency&quot; monitors, not variable-frequency (also known as multisync); in particular, despite running happily at , and , an (e.g.) 8514 cannot sync the otherwise common intermediate SVGA resolution, even at the relatively low 50 to 56 Hz refresh rates initially used.

Although the design of these adapters did not become an industry standard as VGA did, their pixel resolution was subsequently widely adopted as a standard by other manufacturers, and XGA became a synonym for this screen resolution. The only exceptions were the bottom-rung 8086-based Model 25 and 30, which had a cut-down version of VGA referred to as MCGA; the 286 models came with VGA. This supported CGA graphics modes, VGA 256 color and monochrome mode, but not EGA or color .

====VGA video connector====
All of the new PS/2 graphics systems (whether MCGA, VGA, 8514, or later XGA) used a 15-pin D-sub connector for video out. This used analog RGB signals, rather than four or six digital color signals as on previous CGA and EGA monitors. The digital signals limited the color gamut to a fixed 16- or 64-color palette with no room for expansion. In contrast, any color depth (bits per primary) can be encoded into the analog RGB signals so the color gamut can be increased arbitrarily by using wider (more bits per sample) DACs and a more sensitive monitor. The connector was also compatible with analog grayscale displays. Unlike earlier systems such as MDA and Hercules, this was transparent to software, so all programs supporting the new standards could run unmodified whichever type of display was attached. On the other hand, whether the display was color or monochrome was undetectable to software, so selection between application displays optimized for color or monochrome, in applications that supported both, required user intervention. These grayscale displays were relatively inexpensive during the first few years the PS/2 was available, and they were very commonly purchased with lower-end models.

The VGA connector became the de facto standard for connecting monitors and projectors on both PC and non-PC hardware over the course of the early 1990s, replacing a variety of earlier connectors.

===Storage===

Apple had first popularized the 3.5-inch floppy on the Macintosh line and IBM brought them to the PC in 1986 with the PC Convertible. In addition, they could be had as an optional feature on the XT and AT. The PS/2 line used entirely 3.5-inch drives which assisted in their quick adoption by the industry, although the lack of 5.25-inch drive bays in the computers created problems later on in the 1990s as they could not accommodate internal CD-ROM drives. In addition, the lack of built-in 5.25-inch floppy drives meant that PS/2 users could not immediately run the large body of existing IBM-compatible software. However IBM made available optional external 5.25-inch drives, with internal adapters for the early PS/2 models, to enable data transfer.

In the initial lineup, IBM used 720 KB double density (DD) capacity drives on the 8086-based models and 1440 KB high density (HD) on the 80286-based and higher models. By the end of the PS/2 line they had moved to a somewhat standardized capacity of 2880 KB.

The PS/2 floppy drives lacked a capacity detector. 1440 KB floppies had a hole so that drives could distinguish them from 720 KB floppies, preventing users from formatting the smaller capacity disks to the higher capacity (doing so would work, but with a higher tendency of data loss). Clone manufacturers implemented the hole detection, but IBM did not. As a result of this a 720 KB floppy could be formatted to 1440 KB in a PS/2, but the resulting floppy would only be readable by a PS/2 machine.

PS/2s primarily used Mitsubishi floppy drives and did not use a separate Molex power connector; the data cable also contained the power supply lines. As the hardware aged the drives often malfunctioned due to bad quality capacitors.

The PS/2 used several different types of internal hard drives. Early models used MFM or ESDI drives. Some desktop models used combo power/data cables similar to the floppy drives. Later models used DBA ESDI or Parallel SCSI. Typically, desktop PS/2 models only permitted use of one hard drive inside the computer case. Additional storage could be attached externally using the optional SCSI interface.

===Memory===
Later PS/2 models introduced the 72-pin SIMM which became the de facto standard for RAM modules by the mid-1990s in mid-to-late 486 and nearly all Pentium desktop systems. The 72-pin SIMMs were 32/36 bits wide and replaced the old 30-pin SIMM (8/9-bit) standard. The older SIMMs were much less convenient because they had to be installed in sets of two or four to match the width of the CPU&#x27;s 16-bit (Intel 80286 and 80386SX) or 32-bit (80386 and 80486) data bus, and would have been extremely inconvenient to use in Pentium systems (which featured a 64-bit memory bus). The 72-pin SIMMs were also made with greater capacities (starting at 1 MB and ultimately reaching 128 MB, instead of 256 KB to 16 MB (and usually no more than 4 MB) for 30-pin) and in a more finely graduated range (powers of 2, instead of powers of 4).

Many PS/2 models also used proprietary IBM SIMMs and could not be fitted with commonly available types. However industry standard SIMMs could be modified to work in PS/2 machines if the SIMM-presence and SIMM-type detection bridges, or associated contacts, were correctly rewired.

==Models==

At launch, the PS/2 family comprised the Model 30, 50, 60 and 80; the Model 25 was launched a few months later.

The PS/2 Models 25 and 30 (IBM 8525 and 8530, respectively) were the lowest-end models in the lineup and meant to replace the IBM PC and XT. Model 25s came with either an 8086 CPU running at 8 MHz, 512 KB of RAM, and 720 KB floppy disks, or 80286 CPU. The 8086s had ISA expansion slots and a built-in MCGA monitor, which could be either color or monochrome, while the 80286 models came with VGA monitor and ISA expansion slots. A cut-down Model M keyboard with no numeric keypad was standard, with the normal keyboard being an extra-cost option. There was a very rare later model called the PS/2 Model 25-SX which sported either a 16 MHz or 20 MHz 386 CPU, up to 12 MB of memory, IDE hard drive, VGA Monitor and 16 bit ISA slots making it the highest available model 25 available denoted by model number 8525-L41.

 The Model 30 had either an 8086 or 286 CPU and sported the full 101-key keyboard and standalone monitor along with three 8-bit ISA expansion slots. 8086 models had 720 KB floppies while 286 models had 1440 KB ones. Both the Model 25 and 30 could have an optional 20 MB ST-506 hard disk (which in the Model 25 took the place of the second floppy drive if so equipped and used a proprietary 3.5&quot; form factor). 286-based Model 30s are otherwise a full AT-class machine and support up to 4 MB of RAM.
Later ISA PS/2 models comprised the Model 30 286 (a Model 30 with an Intel 286 CPU), &quot;Model 35&quot; (IBM 8535) and &quot;Model 40&quot; (IBM 8540) with Intel 386SX or IBM 386SLC processors.

The higher-numbered models (above 50) were equipped with the Micro Channel bus and mostly ESDI or SCSI hard drives (models 60-041 and 80-041 had MFM hard drives). PS/2 &quot;Models 50&quot; (IBM 8550) and &quot;60&quot; (IBM 8560) used the Intel 286 processor, the PS/2 &quot;Models 70 386&quot; (IBM 8570) and &quot;80&quot; used the 386DX, while the mid-range PS/2 &quot;Model 55 SX&quot; (IBM 8555–081) and used the 16/32-bit 386SX processor. The &quot;Model 50&quot; was revised to the &quot;Model 50 Z&quot; still with 10 MHz 80286 processor, but with memory run at zero wait state, and a switch to ESDI hard drives. Later Model 70 486 and 80 variants (B-xx) also used 25 MHz Intel 486 processors, in a complex called the Power Platform.

The PS/2 &quot;Models 90&quot; (IBM 8590/9590) and &quot;95&quot; (IBM 8595/9595/9595A) used Processor Complex daughterboards holding the CPU, memory controller, MCA interface, and other system components. The available Processor Complex options ranged from the 20 MHz Intel 486 to the 90 MHz Pentium and were fully interchangeable. The IBM &quot;PC Server 500&quot;, which has a motherboard identical to the 9595A, also uses Processor Complexes.

Other later Micro Channel PS/2 models included the Model &quot;65SX&quot; with a 16 MHz 386SX; various &quot;Model 53&quot; (IBM 9553), &quot;56&quot; (IBM 8556) and &quot;57&quot; (IBM 8557) variants with 386SX, 386SLC or 486SLC2 processors; the &quot;Models 76&quot; and &quot;77&quot; (IBM 9576/9577) with 486SX or 486DX2 processors respectively; and the 486-based &quot;Model 85&quot; (IBM 9585).

The IBM &quot;PS/2E&quot; (IBM 9533) was the first Energy Star compliant personal computer. It had a 50 MHz IBM 486SLC processor, an ISA bus, four PC card slots, and an IDE hard drive interface. The environmentally friendly PC borrowed many components from the ThinkPad line and was composed of recycled plastics, designed to be easily recycled at the end of its life, and used very little power.

The IBM PS/2 &quot;Server 195&quot; and &quot;295&quot; (IBM 8600) were 486-based dual-bus MCA network servers supporting asymmetric multiprocessing, designed by Parallan Computer Inc.

The IBM &quot;PC Server 720&quot; (IBM 8642) was the largest MCA-based server made by IBM, although it was not, strictly speaking, a PS/2 model. It could be fitted with up to six Intel Pentium processors interconnected by the Corollary C-bus and up to eighteen SCSI hard disks. This model was equipped with seven combination MCA/PCI slots.

=== PS/2 portables, laptops and notebooks ===

IBM also produced several portable and laptop PS/2s, including the &quot;Model L40&quot; (ISA-bus 386SX), &quot;N33&quot; (IBM&#x27;s first notebook-format computer from year 1991, Model 8533, 386SX), &quot;N51&quot; (386SX/SLC), &quot;P70&quot; (386DX) and &quot;P75&quot; (486DX2).

The IBM &quot;ThinkPad 700C&quot;, aside from being labeled &quot;700C PS/2&quot; on the case, featured MCA and a 486SLC CPU.

===6152 Academic System===

The 6152 Academic System was a workstation computer developed by IBM&#x27;s Academic Information Systems (ACIS) division for the university market introduced in February 1988. The 6152 was based on the PS/2 Model 60, adding a RISC Adapter Card on the Micro Channel bus. This card was a co-processor that enabled the 6152 to run ROMP software compiled for IBM&#x27;s Academic Operating System (AOS), a version of BSD UNIX for the ROMP that was only available to select colleges and universities.

The RISC Adapter Card contained the ROMP-C microprocessor (an enhanced version of the ROMP that first appeared in the IBM RT PC workstations), a memory management unit (the ROMP had virtual memory), a floating-point coprocessor, and up to 8MB of memory for use by the ROMP. The 6152 was the first computer to use the ROMP-C, which would later be introduced in new RT PC models.

==Marketing==

During the 1980s, IBM&#x27;s advertising of the original PC and its other product lines had frequently used the likeness of Charlie Chaplin.

Another campaign featured actors from the television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; playing the staff of a contemporary (i.e. late-1980s) business in roles reminiscent of their characters&#x27; roles from the series. Harry Morgan, Larry Linville, William Christopher, Wayne Rogers, Gary Burghoff, Jamie Farr, and Loretta Swit were in from the beginning, whereas Alan Alda joined the campaign later.

The profound lack of success of these advertising campaigns led, in part, to IBM&#x27;s termination of its relationships with its global advertising agencies; these accounts were reported by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine to have been worth over $500 million a year, and the largest such account review in the history of business.

==Sales==
Overall, the PS/2 line was largely unsuccessful with the consumer market, even though the PC-based Models 30 and 25 were an attempt to address that. With what was widely seen as a technically competent but cynical attempt to gain undisputed control of the market, IBM unleashed an industry backlash, which went on to standardize VESA, EISA and PCI. In large part, IBM failed to establish a link in the consumer&#x27;s mind between the PS/2 MicroChannel architecture and the immature OS/2 1.x operating system; the more capable OS/2 version 2.0 was not released until 1992.

The firm suffered massive financial losses for the remainder of the 1980s, forfeiting its previously unquestioned position as the industry leader, and eventually lost its status as the largest manufacturer of personal computers, first to Compaq and then to Dell. From a high of 10,000 employees in Boca Raton before the PS/2 came out, only seven years later, IBM had $600 million in unsold inventory and was laying off staff by the thousands. 
After the failure of the PS/2 line to establish a new standard, IBM was forced to revert to building ISA PCs—following the industry it had once led—with the low-end PS/1 line and later with the more compatible Aptiva and PS/ValuePoint lines.

Still, the PS/2 platform experienced some success in the corporate sector where the reliability, ease of maintenance and strong corporate support from IBM offset the rather daunting cost of the machines. Also, many people still lived with the motto &quot;Nobody ever got fired for buying an IBM&quot;. In the mid-range desktop market, the models 55SX and later 56SX were the leading sellers for almost their entire lifetimes. Later PS/2 models saw a production life span that took them into the late 1990s, within a few years of IBM selling off the division.

<text>Pontypridd ( , ), colloquially referred to as &quot;Ponty&quot;, is a town and a community in Rhondda Cynon Taf, South Wales, approximately 10 miles north west of Cardiff city centre.

==Geography==
Pontypridd comprises the electoral wards of Cilfynydd, Glyncoch, Graig, Hawthorn, Pontypridd Town, &#x27;Rhondda&#x27;, Rhydyfelin Central/Ilan, Trallwng (Trallwn) and Treforest. The town mainly falls within the Senedd and UK parliamentary constituency by the same name, although the Cilfynydd and Glyncoch wards fall within the Cynon Valley Senedd constituency and the Cynon Valley UK parliamentary constituency. This change was effective for the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, and for the 2010 UK General Election.

The town sits at the junction of the Rhondda and Taff valleys, where the River Rhondda flows into the Taff just south of the town at Ynysangharad War Memorial Park. Pontypridd community recorded a population of about 32,700 in the 2011 census figures. while Pontypridd Town ward itself was recorded as having a population of 2,919 also as of 2011.

The town lies alongside the north–south dual carriageway A470 between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil. The A4054, running north and south of the town, was the former main road, and like the A470, follows the Taff Valley. South of the town is the A473 for Llantrisant and Pencoed. To the west is the A4058, which follows the River Rhondda to Porth and the Rhondda Valley beyond.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name Pontypridd derives from the name , Welsh for &quot;bridge by the earthen house&quot;, referring singly to successive wooden bridges that once spanned the River Taff at this point.

===Old Bridge===
Pontypridd is noted for its Old Bridge, a stone construction across the River Taff built in 1756 by William Edwards. This was Edwards&#x27;s fourth attempt, and at the time of construction, was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in the world. Rising above the level of the river, the bridge forms a perfect segment of a circle, the chord of which is . Notable features are the three holes of differing diameters through each end of the bridge, the purpose of which is to reduce weight. On completion, questions were soon raised as to the utility of the bridge, with the steepness of the design making it difficult to get horses and carts across. As a result, a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge, paid for by public subscription, was built adjacent to the old one in 1857. Pontypridd was known as Newbridge from shortly after the construction of the Old Bridge until the 1860s.

===Coal===
The history of Pontypridd is tied to the coal and iron industries; before their development Pontypridd was a hamlet of a few farmsteads, with Treforest initially becoming the main urban settlement in the area. Sited at the junction of three valleys, it became an important location for transporting coal from the Rhondda and iron from Merthyr Tydfil, first by the Glamorganshire Canal, and later by the Taff Vale Railway, to the ports at Cardiff, Barry and Newport. Its role in coal transport lengthened its railway platform, which is thought to have once been the longest in the world in its heyday. Pontypridd in the second half of the 19th century was a hive of industry, once nicknamed the &quot;Wild West&quot;. There were several collieries within the Pontypridd area itself, including:
*Albion Colliery, Cilfynydd
*Bodwenarth Colliery, Pontsionnorton
*Daren Ddu Colliery, Graigwen &amp; Glyncoch
*Dynea Colliery, Rhydyfelen
*Gelli-whion Colliery, Graig
*Great Western/Gyfeillion Colliery, Hopkinstown
*Lan Colliery, Hopkinstown
*Newbridge Colliery, Graig
*Pen-y-rhiw Colliery, Graig
*Pontypridd/Maritime Collieries, Graig &amp; Maesycoed
*Pwllgwaun Colliery/&#x27;Dan&#x27;s Muck Hole&#x27;, Pwllgwaun
*Red Ash Colliery, Cilfynydd
*Ty-Mawr Colliery, Hopkinstown &amp; Pantygraigwen
*Typica Colliery, Hopkinstown &amp; Pantygraigwen, and
*Victoria Colliery, Maesycoed

As well as deep-mined collieries, there were many coal levels and trial shafts dug into the hillsides overlooking the town from Cilfynydd, Graig, Graigwen and Hafod. The Albion Colliery in the village of Cilfynydd in 1894 underwent one of the worst explosions in the South Wales coalfield, with the death of 290 colliers (see Keir Hardie).

===Iron and steel===
Other instrumental industries in Pontypridd were the Brown Lenox/Newbridge Chain &amp; Anchor Works south-east of the town, and Crawshay&#x27;s Forest Iron, Steel &amp; Tin Plate Works and the Taff Vale Iron Works, both in Treforest near the now University of South Wales.

===Buildings===
The town has a hospital, Dewi Sant Hospital and acts as the headquarters of Transport for Wales Rail at Llys Cadwyn.

==Government==

Pontypridd Urban District Council operated from 1894 to 1974, when it was incorporated into Taff Ely Borough Council. That in turn came under the unitary Rhondda Cynon Taf Council in 1996. Pontypridd Town Council functions as a community council. Labour is the dominant political force and has been since the First World War. The community elects 23 town councillors from 11 community wards: Cilfynydd, Glyncoch, Graig, Hawthorn, Ilan, Pontypridd, Rhondda, Rhydfelen Central, Rhydfelen Lower, Trallwng and Treforest. Pontypridd Municipal Buildings was completed in 1904.

==Pontypridd community==

Pontypridd community comprises the town centre itself, with the following key villages/settlements:
*Cilfynydd
*Coedpenmaen (Coed-Pen-Maen)
*Glyntaff
*Glyncoch
*Graig
*Graigwen &amp; Pantygraigwen
*Hawthorn
*Hopkinstown
*Maesycoed
*Pen-y-coedcae
*Pontsionnorton (Pont Sion Norton)
*Pwllgwaun
*Rhydyfelin
*Trallwn (Trallwng)
*Treforest
*Upper Boat
Pontypridd serves as the postal town for the community of Llantwit Fardre under the CF38 postcode district, although the area is not considered part of Pontypridd.

==Transport links==
Pontypridd came into being because of transport, as it was on the drovers&#x27; route from the south Wales coast and the Bristol Channel, to Merthyr, and onwards into the hills of Brecon. Although initial expansion in the valleys occurred at Treforest due to the slower speed of the River Taff at that point, the establishment of better bridge building meant a natural flow of power to Pontypridd.

===Railway===
The establishment of Pontypridd over Treforest was finally confirmed with the building of the Glamorganshire Canal to serve the coalmines of the Rhondda Valley. However, the volumes of coal extraction soon led to construction of the Taff Vale Railway, which at its peak meant a train passed through Pontypridd railway station (including the freight lines immediately to its west) every two or three minutes. The station was originally built as a long single island, at one point the world&#x27;s longest platform, a reflection of both the narrow available geography of the steep valley side and the need to accommodate many converging railways lines at what became the 19th-century hub of the valleys.

Due to the restrictive geography, only parcels and mail were handled at Pontypridd. Heavy freight went to . The station today is operated by Transport for Wales, which is headquartered in the town. It reflects the fewer destinations served since the Beeching and earlier cuts, with one up (valley) platform, one down (through) platform, a down bay platform (opened in December 2014), and one passing loop.

===Trams, trolleybuses, and buses===
A tram service began on 6 March 1905 from Cilfynydd through Pontypridd to Treforest. It gave way on 18 September 1930 to trolleybuses, which on 31 January 1957 were replaced by buses following the same route.

==Education==

*Pontypridd County Intermediate and Technical School was built in 1895 as a co-educational school in Tyfica Road, later becoming Pontypridd County Grammar School for Boys. In 1973, it became the Coedylan Comprehensive School, and is now the Pontypridd High School in Cilfynydd on the west side of the A4054.
*Hawthorn High School is near the A4054 in Hawthorn (south-east of the town)
*Pontypridd Grammar School for Girls was on Glyntaff Road in Glyntaff.
*Bryn Celynnog Comprehensive School is on Penycoedcae Road in Beddau.

===Twinning===
Pontypridd is twinned with Nürtingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Initial contact was made between them in 1965, with a visit by Côr Meibion Pontypridd Welsh male voice Choir to a choir called (&quot;Coronet of Songs&quot;) based in the Oberensingen area of Nürtingen. The visit was returned a year later. Reciprocal choir visits have continued and the partnership prompted Pontypridd Urban District Council to join with Nürtingen in formal twinning relations, under an agreement signed in July 1968 by John Cheesman, Chairman of Pontypridd UDC, and Karl Gonser, Mayor of Nürtingen.

Pontypridd is twinned with Mbale, Uganda, since an official twinning ceremony in 2005, following links by local churches and health-care workers under the charitable Partnerships Overseas Networking Trust.

<text>Enhanced Small Disk Interface (ESDI) is a hard disk drive interface designed by Maxtor Corporation in 1983 to be a follow-on to the ST-412/506 interface. ESDI improved on ST-506 by moving certain parts that were traditionally kept on the controller (such as the data separator) into the drives themselves, and also generalizing the control bus such that more kinds of devices (such as removable disks and tape drives) could be connected. ESDI uses the same cabling as ST-506 (one 34-pin common control cable, and a 20-pin data channel cable for each device), and thus could easily be retrofitted to ST-506 applications. 

ESDI was popular in the mid-to-late 1980s, when SCSI and IDE technologies were young and immature, and ST-506 was neither fast nor flexible enough. ESDI could handle data rates of 10, 15, or 20 Mbit/s (as opposed to ST-506&#x27;s top speed of 7.5 Mbit/s), and many high-end SCSI drives of the era were actually high-end ESDI drives with SCSI bridges integrated on the drive. 

By 1990, SCSI had matured enough to handle high data rates and multiple types of drives, and ATA was quickly overtaking ST-506 in the desktop market. These two events made ESDI less and less important over time, and by the mid-1990s, ESDI was no longer in common use.
