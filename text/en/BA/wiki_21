<text>Religion in ancient Rome consisted of varying imperial and provincial religious practices, which were followed both by the people of Rome as well as those who were brought under its rule.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety () in maintaining good relations with the gods. Their polytheistic religion is known for having honoured many deities.

The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became fundamental, such as the of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art, as the Etruscans had. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, used by the state to seek the will of the gods. According to legends, most of Rome&#x27;s religious institutions could be traced to its founders, particularly Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome, who negotiated directly with the gods. This archaic religion was the foundation of the , &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot; or simply &quot;tradition&quot;, viewed as central to Roman identity.

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of , &quot;I give that you might give&quot;. Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, rite, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome&#x27;s intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. As the Roman Empire expanded, migrants to the capital brought their local cults, many of which became popular among Romans. Christianity was eventually the most successful of these beliefs, and in 380 became the official state religion.

For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family&#x27;s domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome&#x27;s most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome&#x27;s sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.

== Overview ==
The priesthoods of most state religions were held by members of the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul.

The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism and foreign wars as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability. One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.

By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces, among them Cybele, Isis, Epona, and gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Foreign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. Imported mystery religions, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one&#x27;s family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;magic&quot;, conspiratorial (&quot;coniuratio&quot;), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the Senate&#x27;s efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the First Jewish–Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt.

In the wake of the Republic&#x27;s collapse, state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the well-being of the emperor. So-called &quot;emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the &quot;Genius&quot;, the divine tutelary of every individual. The Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome&#x27;s conflict with Christianity, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel &quot;superstitio&quot;, while Christians considered Roman religion to be paganism. Ultimately, Roman polytheism was brought to an end with the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire.

== Founding myths and divine destiny ==
The Roman mythological tradition is particularly rich in historical myths, or legends, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. For Rome&#x27;s earliest period, history and myth are difficult to distinguish.

According to mythology, Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the Trojan refugee Aeneas, son of Venus, who was said to have established the basis of Roman religion when he brought the Palladium, Lares and Penates from Troy to Italy. These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the Vestals, Rome&#x27;s female priesthood. Aeneas, according to classical authors, had been given refuge by King Evander, a Greek exile from Arcadia, to whom were attributed other religious foundations: he established the &quot;Ara Maxima&quot;, &quot;Greatest Altar&quot;, to Hercules at the site that would become the Forum Boarium, and, so the legend went, he was the first to celebrate the Lupercalia, an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era.
The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy (the Latin kings of Alba Longa) with the well-known legend of Rome&#x27;s founding by Romulus and Remus. The most common version of the twins&#x27; story displays several aspects of hero myth. Their mother, Rhea Silvia, had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father. Through divine intervention, the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars. She gave birth to twins, who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events.

Romulus and Remus regained their grandfather&#x27;s throne and set out to build a new city, consulting with the gods through augury, a characteristic religious institution of Rome that is portrayed as existing from earliest times. The brothers quarrel while building the city walls, and Romulus kills Remus, an act that is sometimes seen as sacrificial. Fratricide thus became an integral part of Rome&#x27;s founding myth.

Romulus was credited with several religious institutions. He founded the Consualia festival, inviting the neighbouring Sabines to participate; the ensuing rape of the Sabine women by Romulus&#x27;s men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome&#x27;s myth of origins. As a successful general, Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome&#x27;s first temple to Jupiter Feretrius and offered the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, the prime spoils taken in war, in the celebration of the first Roman triumph. Spared a mortal&#x27;s death, Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified.
His Sabine successor Numa was pious and peaceable, and credited with numerous political and religious foundations, including the first Roman calendar; the priesthoods of the Salii, flamines, and Vestals; the cults of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus; and the Temple of Janus, whose doors stayed open in times of war but in Numa&#x27;s time remained closed. After Numa&#x27;s death, the doors to the Temple of Janus were supposed to have remained open until the reign of Augustus.

Each of Rome&#x27;s legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic. Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests. The first &quot;outsider&quot; Etruscan king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, founded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter, Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world. The benevolent, divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin League, its Aventine Temple to Diana, and the Compitalia to mark his social reforms. Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbus, whose expulsion marked the end of Roman kingship and the beginning of the Roman republic, governed by elected magistrates.

Roman historians regarded the essentials of Republican religion as complete by the end of Numa&#x27;s reign, and confirmed as right and lawful by the Senate and people of Rome: the sacred topography of the city, its monuments and temples, the histories of Rome&#x27;s leading families, and oral and ritual traditions. According to Cicero, the Romans considered themselves the most religious of all peoples, and their rise to dominance was proof they received divine favor in return.

== Roman deities ==

Rome offers no native creation myth, and little mythography to explain the character of its deities, their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world, but Roman theology acknowledged that &quot;di immortales&quot; (immortal gods) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth. There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien.

The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults. At different times and in different places, the sphere of influence, character and functions of a divine being could expand, overlap with those of others, and be redefined as Roman. Change was embedded within existing traditions.

Several versions of a semi-official, structured pantheon were developed during the political, social and religious instability of the Late Republican era. Jupiter, the most powerful of all gods and &quot;the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested&quot;, consistently personified the divine authority of Rome&#x27;s highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared his temple, some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus, who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva.

A conceptual tendency toward triads may be indicated by the later agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult. Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled, or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure. These later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and often Greek in origin. The Hellenization of Latin literature and culture supplied literary and artistic models for reinterpreting Roman deities in light of the Greek Olympians, and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage.

The impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual&#x27;s domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Rome&#x27;s various neighbourhoods and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion.

In this spirit, a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home:

I wander, never ceasing to pass through the whole world, but I am first and foremost a faithful worshiper of Onuava. I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava&#x27;s favourable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.

== Holidays and festivals ==

Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals. Some lasted several days, others a single day or less: sacred days (&quot;dies fasti&quot;) outnumbered &quot;non-sacred&quot; days (&quot;dies nefasti&quot;). A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions. Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated &quot;ludi&quot; (&quot;games&quot;, such as chariot races and theatrical performances), with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia, and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber. Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes, or particular groups, such as women at the Bona Dea rites.

Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the &quot;ludi&quot; attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (&quot;saeculum&quot;), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.

The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome&#x27;s intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation – a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, Ovid. In his &quot;Fasti&quot;, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker&#x27;s pose as a &quot;vates&quot; or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.

== Temples and shrines ==
Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors, and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. Sacrifices, chiefly of animals, would take place at an open-air altar within the &quot;templum&quot; or precinct, often to the side of the steps leading up to the raised portico. The main room &quot;(cella)&quot; inside a temple housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a small altar for incense or libations. It might also display art works looted in war and rededicated to the gods. It is not clear how accessible the interiors of temples were to the general public.

The Latin word &quot;templum&quot; originally referred not to the temple building itself, but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury: &quot;The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual.&quot; The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word &quot;templum&quot; to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common Latin words &quot;aedes&quot;, &quot;delubrum&quot;, or &quot;fanum&quot; for a temple or shrine as a building. The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture.

Temple buildings and shrines within the city commemorated significant political settlements in its development: the Aventine Temple of Diana supposedly marked the founding of the Latin League under Servius Tullius. Many temples in the Republican era were built as the fulfillment of a vow made by a general in exchange for a victory: Rome&#x27;s first known temple to Venus was vowed by the consul Q. Fabius Gurges in the heat of battle against the Samnites, and dedicated in 295 BC.

== Religious practice ==

=== Prayers, vows, and oaths ===
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective. Pliny the Elder declared that &quot;a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods.&quot; Prayer by itself, however, had independent power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy. Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities. Public prayers (&quot;prex&quot;) were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the &quot;Roman people&quot; among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over. Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.

Oaths—sworn for the purposes of business, clientage and service, patronage and protection, state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities. Refusal to swear a lawful oath &quot;(sacramentum)&quot; and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine. A &quot;votum&quot; or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.

=== Sacrifice ===

In Latin, the word &quot;sacrificium&quot; means the performance of an act that renders something &quot;sacer&quot;, sacred. Sacrifice reinforced the powers and attributes of divine beings, and inclined them to render benefits in return (the principle of &quot;do ut des&quot;).

Offerings to household deities were part of daily life. Lares might be offered spelt wheat and grain-garlands, grapes and first fruits in due season, honey cakes and honeycombs, wine and incense, food that fell to the floor during any family meal, or at their Compitalia festival, honey-cakes and a pig on behalf of the community. Their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant Lemures, might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.

==== Animal sacrifice ====

The most potent offering was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the harmonisation of the earthly and divine, so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.

Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (&quot;di superi&quot;, &quot;gods above&quot;) was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: Juno a white heifer (possibly a white cow); Jupiter a white, castrated ox (&quot;bos mas&quot;) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls. &quot;Di superi&quot; with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various &quot;genii&quot; – including the Emperor&#x27;s – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (&quot;exta&quot;, the innards). Rome&#x27;s officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.
Chthonic gods such as Dis pater, the &quot;di inferi&quot; (&quot;gods below&quot;), and the collective shades of the departed &quot;(di Manes)&quot; were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as &quot;the living cannot share a meal with the dead&quot;. Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. Robigo (or Robigus) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.
A sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an expiation of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (&quot;piaculum&quot;);
a &quot;piaculum&quot; might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the Arval Brethren, for instance, offered a &quot;piaculum&quot; before entering their sacred grove with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.
The pig was a common victim for a &quot;piaculum&quot;.

The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome&#x27;s citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.

Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see &quot;ver sacrum&quot;), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The &quot;contract&quot; with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan&#x27;s death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the &quot;Genius&quot; of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.
The &quot;exta&quot; were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero&#x27;s enumeration the gall bladder (&quot;fel&quot;), liver (&quot;iecur&quot;), heart (&quot;cor&quot;), and lungs (&quot;pulmones&quot;). The &quot;exta&quot; were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were &quot;read&quot; in the context of the &quot;disciplina Etrusca&quot;. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the &quot;exta&quot; and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat &quot;(viscera)&quot; is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The &quot;exta&quot; of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (&quot;olla&quot; or &quot;aula&quot;), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity&#x27;s portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with &quot;mola salsa&quot; (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was &quot;porricere&quot;.

==== Human sacrifice ====
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented. After the Roman defeat at Cannae two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the Forum Boarium, in a stone chamber &quot;which had on a previous occasion [228 BC] also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings&quot;. Livy avoids the word &quot;sacrifice&quot; in connection with this bloodless human life-offering; Plutarch does not. The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain.

In the early stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial &quot;munus&quot; was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the &quot;manes&quot; of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator &quot;munus&quot; was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the &quot;Di Manes&quot; or the revered souls of deceased human beings. The event was therefore a &quot;sacrificium&quot; in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.

The small woollen dolls called &quot;Maniae&quot;, hung on the Compitalia shrines, were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to Mania, as Mother of the Lares. The Junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor L. Junius Brutus, traditionally Rome&#x27;s Republican founder and first consul. Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice, whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses; Marcus Marius Gratidianus was a gruesome example.

Officially, human sacrifice was obnoxious &quot;to the laws of gods and men&quot;. The practice was a mark of the barbarians, attributed to Rome&#x27;s traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls. Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty. A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes. Pliny saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the druids as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain. Despite an empire-wide ban under Hadrian, human sacrifice may have continued covertly in North Africa and elsewhere.

=== Domestic and private cult ===
The &quot;mos maiorum&quot; established the dynastic authority and obligations of the citizen-&quot;paterfamilias&quot; (&quot;the father of the family&quot; or the &quot;owner of the family estate&quot;). He had priestly duties to his &quot;lares&quot;, domestic &quot;penates&quot;, ancestral &quot;Genius&quot; and any other deities with whom he or his family held an interdependent relationship. His own dependents, who included his slaves and freedmen, owed cult to his &quot;Genius&quot;.

&quot;Genius&quot; was the essential spirit and generative power – depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan (gens (pl. &quot;gentes&quot;). A &quot;paterfamilias&quot; could confer his name, a measure of his &quot;genius&quot; and a role in his household rites, obligations and honours upon those he fathered or adopted. His freed slaves owed him similar obligations.

A &quot;pater familias&quot; was the senior priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his &quot;lares&quot; and &quot;penates&quot;, and to his &quot;di parentes&quot;/&quot;divi parentes&quot; at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth. His wife (&quot;mater familias&quot;) was responsible for the household&#x27;s cult to Vesta. In rural estates, bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. Household cults had state counterparts. In Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the &quot;lares&quot; and &quot;penates&quot; from Troy, along with the Palladium which was later installed in the temple of Vesta.

== &quot;Religio&quot; and the state ==
Roman &quot;religio&quot; (religion) was an everyday and vital affair, a cornerstone of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, Roman tradition and ancestral custom. It was ultimately governed by the Roman state, and religious laws.

Care for the gods, the very meaning of &quot;religio&quot;, had therefore to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was &quot;necessary&quot;. Religious behavior – &quot;pietas&quot; in Latin, &quot;eusebeia&quot; in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently, religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. &#x27;When pious travelers happen to pass by a sacred grove or a cult place on their way, they are used to make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to sit down for a while&#x27; (Apuleius, &quot;Florides&quot; 1.1).

Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings, according to the principle &quot;do ut des&quot; (&quot;I give, that you might give&quot;). Proper, respectful &quot;religio&quot; brought social harmony and prosperity. Religious neglect was a form of atheism: impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were &quot;vitia&quot; (impious errors). Excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were &quot;superstitio&quot;. Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (&quot;ira deorum&quot;) and therefore harm the State. The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions, and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors. State cult rituals were almost always performed in daylight and in full public view, by priests who acted on behalf of the Roman state and the Roman people. Congregations were expected to respectfully observe the proceedings. Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to the community and its values.

Official cults were state funded as a &quot;matter of public interest&quot; (&quot;res publica&quot;). Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities. The difference between public and private cult is often unclear. Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities. The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults, and held the state-funded (thus public) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival, which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors. Some rites of the &quot;domus&quot; (household) were held in public places but were legally defined as &quot;privata&quot; in part or whole. All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and &quot;pontifices&quot;.

=== Public priesthoods and religious law ===

Rome had no separate priestly caste or class. The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices, officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes. Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as &quot;haruspices&quot; and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; functioned as priest, and members of his &quot;familia&quot; as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the &quot;flamines&quot; (the singular is &quot;flamen&quot;), attributed to king Numa: the major &quot;flamines&quot;, dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser &quot;flamines&quot; were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. &quot;Flamines&quot; were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter&#x27;s &quot;flamen&quot; in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career.

In the Regal era, a &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; (king of the sacred rites) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king (&quot;rex&quot;) or in his absence, and announced the public festivals. He had little or no civil authority. With the abolition of monarchy, the collegial power and influence of the Republican &quot;pontifices&quot; increased. By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical &quot;collegia&quot;. The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;.

Public priests were appointed by the &quot;collegia&quot;. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain.

Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the &quot;Cursus honorum&quot;, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime&#x27;s service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia &quot;seviri&quot; offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business.

During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every 3 January they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.

==== The Vestals ====

The Vestals were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of Vesta, goddess of the hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame. A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her father&#x27;s authority. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus.

A Vestal&#x27;s dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women, with elements of both virgin bride and daughter, and Roman matron and wife. Unlike male priests, Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children, and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced: a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive. Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties, which were considered essential to the security of Rome.

The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community. Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta&#x27;s flame. The Vestals cared for the Lares and Penates of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home. Besides their own festival of Vestalia, they participated directly in the rites of Parilia, Parentalia and Fordicidia. Indirectly, they played a role in every official sacrifice; among their duties was the preparation of the &quot;mola salsa&quot;, the salted flour that was sprinkled on every sacrificial victim as part of its immolation.

One mythological tradition held that the mother of Romulus and Remus was a Vestal virgin of royal blood. A tale of miraculous birth also attended on Servius Tullius, sixth king of Rome, son of a virgin slave-girl impregnated by a disembodied phallus arising mysteriously on the royal hearth; the story was connected to the &quot;fascinus&quot; that was among the cult objects under the guardianship of the Vestals.

Augustus&#x27; religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia, wife of Augustus. They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta&#x27;s sacred fire and vacated her temple.

=== Augury ===

Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur. The original meaning of the Latin word &quot;templum&quot; was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building. Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary &quot;(pomerium)&quot; had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural &quot;templum&quot; appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium. Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the &quot;templum&quot; before, during and after an act of sacrifice.

Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (&quot;vitia&quot;) or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (&quot;ius augurum&quot;) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur&#x27;s observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic. By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of &quot;pontifices&quot;, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

==== Haruspicy ====

Haruspicy was also used in public cult, under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate. The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice, particularly the liver. They also interpreted omens, prodigies and portents, and formulated their expiation. Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan &quot;outsider&quot; religious profession, separate from Rome&#x27;s internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable. During the mid-to-late Republic, the reformist Gaius Gracchus, the populist politician-general Gaius Marius and his antagonist Sulla, and the &quot;notorious Verres&quot; justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The Senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good. The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect: none of this seems to have troubled Marius, who employed a Syrian prophetess.

==== Omens and prodigies ====
Omens observed within or from a divine augural templum – especially the flight of birds – were sent by the gods in response to official queries. A magistrate with &quot;ius augurium&quot; (the right of augury) could declare the suspension of all official business for the day (&quot;obnuntiato&quot;) if he deemed the omens unfavourable. Conversely, an apparently negative omen could be re-interpreted as positive, or deliberately blocked from sight.

Prodigies were transgressions in the natural, predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune. The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false, or genuine and in the public interest, in which case it was referred to the public priests, augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation. In 207 BC, during one of the Punic Wars&#x27; worst crises, the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved &quot;at least twenty days&quot; of dedicated rites. Citing Polybius, Livy records a number of these including a &quot;phantom navy&quot; of ships flying through the sky and an ox climbing to the third story of a home. Later historians viewed these accounts as reactions to the unfolding military crisis.

Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman &quot;religio&quot;. The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun&#x27;s disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of &quot;greater victims&quot;. The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a cock (and vice versa) – these were expiated with &quot;lesser victims&quot;. The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina, singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation. Religious restitution is proved only by Rome&#x27;s victory.

In the wider context of Graeco-Roman religious culture, Rome&#x27;s earliest reported portents and prodigies stand out as atypically dire. Whereas for Romans, a comet presaged misfortune, for Greeks it might equally signal a divine or exceptionally fortunate birth. In the late Republic, a daytime comet at the murdered Julius Caesar&#x27;s funeral games confirmed his deification; a discernible Greek influence on Roman interpretation.

== Mystery religions ==
Most of Rome&#x27;s mystery cults were derived from Greek originals, adopted by individuals as private, or were formally adopted as public. Mystery cults operated through a hierarchy consisting of transference of knowledge, virtues and powers to those initiated through secret rites of passage, which might employ dance, music, intoxicants and theatrical effects to provoke an overwhelming sense of religious awe, revelation and eventual catharsis. The cult of Mithras was among the most notable, particularly popular among soldiers and based on the Zoroastrian deity, Mithra.

Some of Rome&#x27;s most prominent deities had both public and mystery rites. Magna Mater, conscripted to help Rome defeat Carthage in the second Punic War, arrived in Rome with her consort, Attis, and their joint &quot;foreign&quot;, non-citizen priesthood, known as Galli. Despite her presumed status as an ancestral, Trojan goddess, a priesthood was drawn from Rome&#x27;s highest echelons to supervise her cult and festivals. These may have been considered too exotically &quot;barbaric&quot; to trust, and were barred to slaves.

For the Galli, full priesthood involved self-castration, illegal for Romans of any class. Later, citizens could pay for the costly sacrifice of a bull or the lesser sacrifice of a ram, as a substitute for the acolyte&#x27;s self-castration. Magna Mater&#x27;s initiates tended to be very well-off, and relatively uncommon; they included the emperor Julian. Initiates to Attis&#x27; cult were more numerous and less wealthy, and acted as assistant citizen-priests in their deity&#x27;s &quot;exotic&quot; festivals, some of which involved the Galli&#x27;s public, bloody self-flagellation.

Rome&#x27;s native cults to the grain goddess Ceres and her daughter Libera were supplemented with a mystery cult of Ceres-with-Proserpina, based on the Greek Eleusinian mysteries and Thesmophoria, introduced in 205 BC and led at first by ethnically Greek priestesses from &quot;Graeca magna&quot;. The Eleusinian mysteries are also the likely source for the mysteries of Isis, which employed symbols and rites that were nominally Egyptian. Aspects of the Isis mysteries are almost certainly described in Appuleius&#x27; novel, The Golden Ass. Such cults were mistrusted by Rome&#x27;s authorities as quasi-magical, potentially seductive and emotionally based, rather than practical.

The wall-paintings in Pompeii&#x27;s &quot;Villa of the Mysteries&quot; could have functioned equally as religious inspiration, instruction, and high quality domestic decor (described by Beard as &quot;expensive wallpaper&quot;). They also attest to an increasingly personal, even domestic experience of religion, whether or not they were ever part of organised cult meetings. The paintings probably represent the once-notorious, independent, popular Bacchanalia mysteries, forcibly brought under the direct control of Rome&#x27;s civil and religious authorities, 100 years before.

A common theme among the eastern mystery religions present in Rome became disillusionment with material possessions, a focus on death and a preoccupation with regards to the afterlife. These attributes later led to the appeal to Christianity, which in its early stages was often viewed as mystery religion itself.

== Funerals and the afterlife ==

Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy. The traditional care of the dead, however, and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion. Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods. As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name. Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.

Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero&#x27;s time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with &quot;a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient&quot;. Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed from the world of the living into the underworld, as one of the &quot;di Manes&quot;, underworld spirits; the ancestral &quot;manes&quot; of families were celebrated and appeased at their cemeteries or tombs, in the obligatory Parentalia, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February.

A standard Roman funerary inscription is &quot;Dis Manibus&quot; (to the Manes-gods). Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, &quot;theoîs katachthoníois&quot; and Lugdunum&#x27;s commonplace but mysterious &quot;dedicated under the trowel&quot; &quot;(sub ascia dedicare)&quot;.

In the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of &quot;novemdialis&quot; found a part-match in the Christian &quot;Constitutio Apostolica&quot;. The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the &quot;drunken&quot; practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to &quot;new life&quot;.
== Religion and the military ==

Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective &quot;virtus&quot; (roughly, &quot;manly virtue&quot;) and the divine will: lack of &quot;virtus&quot;, civic or private negligence in &quot;religio&quot; and the growth of &quot;superstitio&quot; provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster. Military success was the touchstone of a special relationship with the gods, and to Jupiter Capitolinus in particular; triumphal generals were dressed as Jupiter, and laid their victor&#x27;s laurels at his feet.

Roman commanders offered vows to be fulfilled after success in battle or siege; and further vows to expiate their failures. Camillus promised Veii&#x27;s goddess Juno a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion &quot;(evocatio)&quot;, conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome &quot;with miraculous ease&quot; and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.

Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual; in effect they were Rome in miniature. The commander&#x27;s headquarters stood at the centre; he took the auspices on a dais in front. A small building behind housed the legionary standards, the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era, the image of the ruling emperor. In one camp, this shrine is even called Capitolium. The most important camp-offering appears to have been the &quot;suovetaurilia&quot; performed before a major, set battle. A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a &quot;lustratio exercitus&quot;) and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan&#x27;s column shows three such events from his Dacian wars. The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine &quot;templum&quot;; all within are purified and protected.
Each camp had its own religious personnel; standard bearers, priestly officers and their assistants, including a haruspex, and housekeepers of shrines and images. A senior magistrate-commander (sometimes even a consul) headed it, his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty. As in Rome, whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business; legionary forts and &quot;vici&quot; included shrines to household gods, personal deities and deities otherwise unknown.

From the earliest Imperial era, citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his &quot;familia&quot; on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows. They celebrated Rome&#x27;s official festivals &quot;in absentia&quot;, and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire, Jupiter, Victoria and Concordia were typical. By the early Severan era, the military also offered cult to the Imperial &quot;divi&quot;, the current emperor&#x27;s &quot;numen&quot;, &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;domus&quot; (or &quot;familia&quot;), and special cult to the Empress as &quot;mother of the camp&quot;. The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to Mithras of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into Solar and Stoic Monism as a focus of military &quot;concordia&quot; and Imperial loyalty.
The &quot;devotio&quot; was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make, promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods. Livy offers a detailed account of the &quot;devotio&quot; carried out by Decius Mus; family tradition maintained that his son and grandson, all bearing the same name, also devoted themselves. Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim&#x27;s liver appears &quot;damaged where it refers to his own fortunes&quot;. Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy, Decius commits himself and the enemy to the &quot;dii Manes&quot; and Tellus, charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering. Had he failed to die, his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void, with possibly disastrous consequences. The act of &quot;devotio&quot; is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman gladiator.

The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful. In the early days of Rome&#x27;s war against Carthage, the commander Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC) launched a sea campaign &quot;though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices&quot;. In defiance of the omen, he threw them into the sea, &quot;saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. He was defeated, and on being bidden by the Senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger Glycias, as if again making a jest of his country&#x27;s peril.&quot; His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career.

== Women and religion ==
Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the &quot;paterfamilias&quot;. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.

Literary sources vary in their depiction of women&#x27;s religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to self-indulgent religious enthusiasms, novelties and the seductions of &quot;superstitio&quot;.

== &quot;Superstitio&quot; and magic ==
Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were &quot;superstitio&quot;, in the sense of &quot;doing or believing more than was necessary&quot;, to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone. The boundary between &quot;religio&quot; and &quot;superstitio&quot; is not clearly defined. The famous tirade of Lucretius, the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as &quot;superstition&quot; was in fact aimed at excessive &quot;religio&quot;. Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith, but &quot;superstitio&quot; was viewed as an &quot;inappropriate desire for knowledge&quot;; in effect, an abuse of &quot;religio&quot;.

In the everyday world, many individuals sought to divine the future, influence it through magic, or seek vengeance with help from &quot;private&quot; diviners. The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods, not foretelling the future. Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect. So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit, subversive or magical purposes. Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times, notably in 139 BC and 33 BC. In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death. &quot;Egyptian rites&quot; were particularly suspect: Augustus banned them within the &quot;pomerium&quot; to doubtful effect; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19. Despite several Imperial bans, magic and astrology persisted among all social classes. In the late 1st century AD, Tacitus observed that astrologers &quot;would always be banned and always retained at Rome&quot;.

In the Graeco-Roman world, practitioners of magic were known as &quot;magi&quot; (singular &quot;magus&quot;), a &quot;foreign&quot; title of Persian priests. Apuleius, defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as &quot;in popular tradition &quot;(more vulgari)&quot;... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (&quot;vi cantaminum&quot;) for everything he wishes to.&quot; Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical &quot;History of magical arts&quot; from their supposed Persian origins to Nero&#x27;s vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods. Philostratus takes pains to point out that the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a &quot;magus&quot;, &quot;despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to vanish into thin air&quot;.

Lucan depicts Sextus Pompeius, the doomed son of Pompey the Great, as convinced &quot;the gods of heaven knew too little&quot; and awaiting the Battle of Pharsalus by consulting with the Thessalian witch Erichtho, who practices necromancy and inhabits deserted graves, feeding on rotting corpses. Erichtho, it is said, can arrest &quot;the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers&quot; and make &quot;austere old men blaze with illicit passions&quot;. She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods, mankind and destiny. A female foreigner from Thessaly, notorious for witchcraft, Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature, along with Horace&#x27;s Canidia.
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation (&quot;malum carmen&quot;, or &#x27;noisome metrical charm&#x27;); this included the &quot;charming of crops from one field to another&quot; (&quot;excantatio frugum&quot;) and any rite that sought harm or death to others. Chthonic deities functioned at the margins of Rome&#x27;s divine and human communities; although sometimes the recipients of public rites, these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the &quot;pomerium&quot;. Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze, during the hours of darkness. Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals. The barrier between private religious practices and &quot;magic&quot; is permeable, and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public Feralia festival that are indistinguishable from magic: an old woman squats among a circle of younger women, sews up a fish-head, smears it with pitch, then pierces and roasts it to &quot;bind hostile tongues to silence&quot;. By this she invokes Tacita, the &quot;Silent One&quot; of the underworld.

Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells (&quot;defixiones&quot;), magical papyri and so-called &quot;voodoo dolls&quot; from a very early era. Around 250 &quot;defixiones&quot; have been recovered just from Roman Britain, in both urban and rural settings. Some seek straightforward, usually gruesome revenge, often for a lover&#x27;s offense or rejection. Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs, in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate, and promise a portion of the value (usually small) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration. None of these &quot;defixiones&quot; seem produced by, or on behalf of the elite, who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice. Similar traditions existed throughout the empire, persisting until around the 7th century AD, well into the Christian era.

== History of Roman religion ==

=== Religion and politics ===

Rome&#x27;s government, politics and religion were dominated by an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy. Approximately half of Rome&#x27;s population were slave or free non-citizens. Most others were plebeians, the lowest class of Roman citizens. Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights; far fewer could actually exercise them. Women had no vote. However, all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices, in the name of the Senate and people of Rome. &quot;In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine, just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans&quot;.

The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome&#x27;s internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The Senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.
While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the &quot;silen&quot; of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus&#x27; censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber&#x27;s festival continued.

The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society. In the middle Republican era, even Scipio&#x27;s tentative hints that he might be Jupiter&#x27;s special protege sat ill with his colleagues. Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal; both Sulla and Pompey claimed special relationships with Venus. Julius Caesar went further; he claimed her as his ancestress, and thus an intimate source of divine inspiration for his personal character and policies. In 63 BC, his appointment as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; &quot;signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics&quot;. Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public &quot;ludi&quot; and &quot;munera&quot; whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic. Under the principate, such opportunities were limited by law; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps (&quot;first citizen&quot;).

Because of you we are living, because of you we can travel the seas, because of you we enjoy liberty and wealth. —A thanksgiving prayer offered in Naples&#x27; harbour to the princeps Augustus, on his return from Alexandria in 14 AD, shortly before his death.

=== Early Republic ===

By the end of the regal period Rome had developed into a city-state, with a large plebeian, artisan class excluded from the old patrician &quot;gentes&quot; and from the state priesthoods. The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours; according to tradition, Rome&#x27;s Etruscan connections established a temple to Minerva on the predominantly plebeian Aventine; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, installed in a Capitoline temple, built in an Etruscan style and dedicated in a new September festival, &quot;Epulum Jovis&quot;. These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned, as if noble guests, at their own inaugural banquet.

Rome&#x27;s diplomatic agreement with its neighbours of Latium confirmed the Latin league and brought the cult of Diana from Aricia to the Aventine. and established on the Aventine in the &quot;commune Latinorum Dianae templum&quot;: At about the same time, the temple of Jupiter Latiaris was built on the Alban mount, its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome&#x27;s inclusive hegemony. Rome&#x27;s affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the &quot;pomoerium&quot;. The cult to Hercules at the &quot;ara maxima&quot; in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur. The Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the Forum Romanum: Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy, and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste. In 217, the Venus of Eryx was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill.

=== Later Republic to Principate ===
The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome&#x27;s most significant aggressive and defensive military forays. Livy attributed the disasters of the early part of Rome&#x27;s second Punic War to a growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury and the neglect of Rome&#x27;s traditional gods, whose anger was expressed directly through Rome&#x27;s defeat at Cannae (216 BC). The Sibylline books were consulted. They recommended a general vowing of the &quot;ver sacrum&quot; and in the following year, the living burial of two Greeks and two Gauls; not the first nor the last sacrifice of its kind, according to Livy.

In 206 BC, during the Punic crisis, the Sibylline books recommended the introduction of a cult to the Magna Mater (Great Mother) from Pessinus, supposedly an ancestral goddess of Romans and Trojans. She was installed on the Palatine in 191 BC.

Deities with troublesome followers were taken over, not banned. An unofficial, popular mystery cult to Bacchus was officially taken over, restricted and supervised as potentially subversive in 186 BC.

The priesthoods of most Roman deities with clearly Greek origins used an invented version of Greek costume and ritual, which Romans called &quot;Greek rites.&quot; The spread of Greek literature, mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome&#x27;s festivals and rituals, and the embellishment of its mythology. Ennius translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian Euhemerus, who explained the genesis of the gods as deified mortals. In the last century of the Republic, Epicurean and particularly Stoic interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held – or had held – high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, Scaevola and the polymath Varro. For Varro – well versed in Euhemerus&#x27; theory – popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.

Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods, so did some individual Romans. In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome&#x27;s leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity. Most notably in the very late Republic, the Julii claimed Venus Genetrix as an ancestor; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult. The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil&#x27;s poetic, Imperial vision of the past.

In the late Republic, the so-called Marian reforms supposedly did the following: lowered an existing property bar on conscription, increased the efficiency of Rome&#x27;s armies, and made them available as instruments of political ambition and factional conflict. The consequent civil wars led to changes at every level of Roman society. Augustus&#x27; principate established peace and subtly transformed Rome&#x27;s religious life – or, in the new ideology of Empire, restored it (see below).

Sissel Undheim has argued that, with their &quot;Religions of Rome&quot; volumes, Mary Beard, John North, and Simon Price dismantled the well-established narrative of the decline of religious in the late Republic, opening the way for more innovative and dynamic perspectives. Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; became a &quot;de facto&quot; consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome&#x27;s major priesthoods, including that of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the &quot;pax deorum&quot;, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.

=== Roman Empire ===

==== Eastern Influence ====

Under the rule of Augustus, there existed a deliberate campaign to reinstate previously held belief systems amongst the Roman population. These once held ideals had been eroded and met with cynicism by this time. The imperial order emphasized commemoration of great men and events which led to the concept and practice of divine kingship. Emperors postceding Augustus subsequently held the office of Chief Priest (pontifex maximus) combining both political and religious supremacy under one title.

==== Absorption of Cults ====

The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures; in principle, Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin, Etruscan and other Italian peoples, cults and deities as Roman. Those who acknowledged Rome&#x27;s hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of Roman religious law. Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis. Autonomy and concord were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models. Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia. By the middle of the 1st century AD, Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, Romanised cult nearby: by the end of that century, Sabratha&#x27;s so-called tophet was no longer in use. Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome&#x27;s Capitoline Triad were a logical choice, not a centralised legal requirement. Major cult centres to &quot;non-Roman&quot; deities continued to prosper: notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium, the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo&#x27;s sacred wood at Antioch.

The overall scarcity of evidence for smaller or local cults does not always imply their neglect; votive inscriptions are inconsistently scattered throughout Rome&#x27;s geography and history. Inscribed dedications were an expensive public declaration, one to be expected within the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit but by no means universal. Innumerable smaller, personal or more secretive cults would have persisted and left no trace.

Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of &quot;Romanitas&quot;. Rome&#x27;s citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities, including their traditional gods, the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the &quot;diis deabusque omnibus&quot; (all the gods and goddesses). They also brought Roman &quot;domestic&quot; deities and cult practices with them. By the same token, the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military.

Traders, legions and other travellers brought home cults originating from Egypt, Greece, Iberia, India and Persia. The cults of Cybele, Isis, Mithras, and Sol Invictus were particularly important. Some of those were initiatory religions of intense personal significance, similar to Christianity in those respects.

==== Imperial cult ====

In the early Imperial era, the princeps (lit. &quot;first&quot; or &quot;foremost&quot; among citizens) was offered &quot;genius&quot;-cult as the symbolic &quot;paterfamilias&quot; of Rome. His cult had further precedents: popular, unofficial cult offered to powerful benefactors in Rome: the kingly, god-like honours granted a Roman general on the day of his triumph; and in the divine honours paid to Roman magnates in the Greek East from at least 195 BC.

The deification of deceased emperors had precedent in Roman domestic cult to the &quot;dii parentes&quot; (deified ancestors) and the mythic apotheosis of Rome&#x27;s founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State &quot;divus&quot; (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor&#x27;s deceased wife, sister or daughter could be promoted to &quot;diva&quot; (female divinity).

The first and last Roman known as a living &quot;divus&quot; was Julius Caesar, who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy; he was murdered soon after. Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar&#x27;s successor, Augustus, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal. By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome&#x27;s political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his &quot;reformed&quot; and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his &quot;numen&quot;. By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West. Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship.

In an empire of great religious and cultural diversity, the Imperial cult offered a common Roman identity and dynastic stability. In Rome, the framework of government was recognisably Republican. In the Provinces, this would not have mattered; in Greece, the emperor was &quot;not only endowed with special, super-human abilities, but... he was indeed a visible god&quot; and the little Greek town of Akraiphia could offer official cult to &quot;liberating Zeus Nero for all eternity&quot;.

In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living &quot;divus&quot; but father of his country (&quot;pater patriae&quot;), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the &quot;dii manes&quot; was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a &quot;divus&quot;, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of &quot;divus&quot; as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his &quot;genius&quot;; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.

==== Jews and Roman religion ====

For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate, Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea&#x27;s Hellenised elite. Diaspora Jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them. Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period. Judaea&#x27;s enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora; in Rome, this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion. Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate &quot;collegia&quot; by Julius Caesar. By the Augustan era, the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews. In some periods under Roman rule, Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice, under certain conditions. Judaism was a &quot;superstitio&quot; to Cicero, but the Church Father Tertullian described it as &quot;religio licita&quot; (an officially permitted religion) in contrast to Christianity.

====Christianity in the Roman Empire==== 
Roman investigations into early Christianity found it an irreligious, novel, disobedient, even atheistic sub-sect of Judaism: it appeared to deny all forms of religion and was therefore &quot;superstitio&quot;. By the end of the Imperial era, Nicene Christianity was the one permitted Roman &quot;religio&quot;; all other cults were heretical or pagan &quot;superstitiones&quot;.

After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, Emperor Nero accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats, who were later persecuted and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, &quot;contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms&quot;, regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless, who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority of Rome&#x27;s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.

In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to &quot;ancestral gods&quot; or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt. Decius&#x27; edict appealed to whatever common &quot;mos maiores&quot; (ancestors&#x27; customs) might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman. Apostasy was sought, rather than capital punishment. A year after its due deadline, the edict expired.
Valerian singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome&#x27;s traditional gods. In another edict, he described Christianity as a threat to Empire – not yet at its heart but close to it, among Rome&#x27;s equites and Senators. Christian apologists interpreted his eventual fate – a disgraceful capture and death – as divine judgement. The next forty years were peaceful; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile, due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence. Origen discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius&#x27; predecessor Philip the Arab in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a &quot;pagan&quot; basis in Christian heresies. The Christian churches were disunited; Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 both for his doctrines, and for his unworthy, indulgent, elite lifestyle. Meanwhile, Aurelian (270–75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (&quot;concordia militum&quot;), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; in Rome&#x27;s Campus Martius.
In 295, Maximilian of Tebessa refused military service; in 298 Marcellus renounced his military oath. Both were executed for treason; both were Christians. At some time around 302, a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;domus&quot; and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity. The first (303 AD) &quot;ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts, forbade services to be held, degraded officials who were Christians, re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians, and reduced the legal rights of all Christians... [Physical] or capital punishments were not imposed on them&quot; but soon after, several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed. The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice. An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods, in terms that recall the Decian edict.

In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred. Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine I. Diocletian&#x27;s successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311, when he asked Christians to pray for him. &quot;This meant an official recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire, although one of the tetrarchs, Maximinus Daia, still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313.&quot;

==== Emperor Constantine and Christianity ====

The conversion of Constantine I ended the Christian persecutions. Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the &quot;pax deorum&quot; with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was (in traditional Roman terms) auspicious – or in Christian terms, what was orthodox. The edict of Milan (313) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration. Constantine had triumphed under the &quot;signum&quot; (sign) of the Christ: Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new Eastern capital, Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests. He passed laws to protect Christians from persecution; he also funded the building of churches, including Saint Peter&#x27;s basilica. He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the &quot;genius&quot; of living emperors, though his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian&#x27;s in their elevation of the emperor as somehow more than human.

Constantine promoted orthodoxy in Christian doctrine, so that Christianity might become a unitary force, rather than divisive. He summoned Christian bishops to a meeting, later known as the First Council of Nicaea, at which some 318 bishops (mostly easterners) debated and decided what was orthodox, and what was heresy. The meeting reached consensus on the Nicene Creed. At Constantine&#x27;s death, he was honored as a Christian and as an Imperial &quot;divus&quot;. Later, Philostorgius would criticize those Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the &quot;divus&quot; Constantine.

==== Transition to Christian hegemony ====

Christianity and traditional Roman religion proved incompatible. From the 2nd century onward, the Church Fathers had condemned the diverse non-Christian religions practiced throughout the Empire as &quot;pagan&quot;. Constantine&#x27;s actions have been regarded by some scholars as causing the rapid growth of Christianity, though many modern scholars disagree. Constantine&#x27;s unique form of Imperial orthodoxy did not outlast him. After his death in 337, two of his sons, Constantius II and Constans, took over the leadership of the empire and re-divided their Imperial inheritance. Constantius was an Arian and his brothers were Nicene Christians.

Constantine&#x27;s nephew Julian rejected the &quot;Galilean madness&quot; of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of neo-Platonism, Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult. Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively fostered a religious and cultural pluralism, attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights. He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem&#x27;s temple as an Imperial project and argued against the &quot;irrational impieties&quot; of Christian doctrine. His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The empire once again fell under Christian control, this time permanently.

In 380, under Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire. Christian heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, though Rome&#x27;s original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.

The Western emperor Gratian refused the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, and against the protests of the Senate, removed the altar of Victory from the Senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. Theodosius I briefly re-united the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors. Ambrose, the influential Bishop of Milan and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus&#x27;s request for tolerance. Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome&#x27;s traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic Senate in traditional Hellenic terms. He was the last emperor of both East and West.

===Pagan continuity===

Christianity was introduced late in Mani, with the first Greek temples converted into churches during the 11th century. Byzantine monk Nikon &quot;the Metanoite&quot; (Νίκων ὁ Μετανοείτε) was sent in the 10th century to convert the predominantly pagan Maniots. Although his preaching began the conversion process, it took over 200 years for the majority to accept Christianity fully by the 11th and 12th centuries. Patrick Leigh Fermor noted that the Maniots, isolated by mountains, were among the last Greeks to abandon the old religion, doing so towards the end of the 9th century:

According to Constantine VII in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, the Maniots were referred to as &#x27;Hellenes&#x27; and only fully Christianized in the 9th century, despite some church ruins from the 4th century indicating early Christian presence. The region&#x27;s mountainous terrain allowed the Maniots to evade the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s Christianization efforts, thus preserving pagan traditions, which coincided with significant years in the life of Gemistos Plethon.

The modern Roman religion, unlike other neopagan movements, is regarded as having been transmitted esoterically through families such as the Latriani, connected to the Medici and inspired by George Gemistus Plethon, who contributed to the founding of the Neoplatonic Academy in Florence. This tradition also influenced the Roman Academy of Pomponio Leto in the 15th century. Leto symbolically restored the role of the Pontifex Maximus and celebrated the Natalis Romae, though the academy was dissolved by Pope Paul II in 1468.

Between the 19th and 20th centuries, figures such as Giacomo Boni and Julius Evola revived ancient Roman rituals for cultural and political purposes. Evola, through the Gruppo di Ur and his book Imperialismo Pagano (1928), advocated for a resurgence of Roman spirituality. During the same period, Leone Caetani asserted that Etruscan-Roman rituals had influenced historical events, including victory in World War I.

In the 2000s, the Associazione Tradizionale Pietas reconstructed temples such as the Temple of Minerva in Taranto and initiated steps for legal recognition. It also participated in the European Congress of Ethnic Religions (ECER), signing the Riga Declaration advocating for the acknowledgment of ethnic religions. Public celebrations like the Natalis Romae continue, thanks to groups such as the Gruppo Storico Romano.

<text>The Second Anglo-Boer War had no sooner commenced with the ultimatum of the Transvaal Republic on 9 October 1899, than Mr Schreiner found himself called upon to deal with the conduct of Cape rebels. The rebels joined the invading forces of President Steyn, whose false assurances Mr Schreiner had offered to an indignant House of Assembly only a few weeks before. The war on the part of the Republics was evidently not to be merely one of self-defence. It was one of aggression and aggrandisement. Mr Schreiner ultimately addressed, as prime minister, a sharp remonstrance to President Steyn for allowing his burghers to invade the colony. He also co-operated with Sir Alfred Milner, and used his influence to restrain the Bond.

==After the war==

The acknowledgment of defeat by the Boers in the field, and the surrender of some 10,000 rebels, did not weaken the endeavours of the Dutch to obtain political supremacy in the colony. Moreover, in the autumn of 1902 Sir Gordon Sprigg, the prime minister, nominally the leader of the Progressives, sought to maintain his position by securing the support of the Bond party in parliament. In the early part of 1903 Mr Chamberlain included Cape Town in his visit to South Africa, and had conferences with the political leaders of all parties. Reconciliation between the Bond and British elements in the colony was, however, still impossible, and the two parties concentrated their efforts on a struggle for victory at the coming election. Mr Hofmeyr, who had chosen to spend the greater part of the war period in Europe, returned to the Cape to reorganize the Bond. On the other side Dr Jameson came forward as the leader of the Progressives. Parliament was dissolved in September 1903. It had passed, since the war, two measures of importance - one (1902) restricting alien immigration, the other (1903) ratifying the first customs convention between all the South African colonies. This convention was notable for its grant of preferential treatment (in general, a rebate of 25% on the customs already levied) to imports from the United Kingdom.

The election turned on the issue of British or Bond supremacy. It was fought on a register purged of the rebel voters, many of whom, besides being disfranchised, were in prison. The issue was doubtful, and each side sought to secure the support of the native voters, who in several constituencies held the balance of power. The Bondsmen were more lavish than their opponents in their promises to the natives and even invited an African journalist (who declined) to stand for a seat in the Assembly. In view of the agitation then proceeding for the introduction of Chinese coolies to work the mines on the Rand, the Progressives declared their intention, if returned, to exclude them from the colony, and this declaration gained them some native votes. The polling (in January and February 1904) resulted in a Progressive majority of five in a house of 95 members. The rejected candidates included prominent Bond supporters like Mr Merriman and Mr Sauer, and also Sir Gordon Sprigg and Mr A. Douglass, another member of the cabinet. Mr W. P. Schreiner, the ex-premier, who stood as an Independent, was also rejected.

==The Jameson Ministry==

On 18 February Sir Gordon Sprigg resigned and was succeeded by Dr L. S. Jameson, who formed a ministry wholly British in character. The first task of the new government was to introduce (on 4 March) an Additional Representation Bill, to rectify - in part - the disparity in electoral power of the rural and urban districts. Twelve new seats in the House of Assembly were divided among the larger towns, and three members were added to the legislative council. The town voter being mainly British, the bill met with the bitter opposition of the Bond members, who declared that its object was the extinction of their parliamentary power. In fact, the bill was called for by the glaring anomalies in the distribution of seats by which a minority of voters in the country districts returned a majority of members, and it left the towns still inadequately represented. The bill was supported by two or three Dutch members, who were the object of violent attack by the Bondsmen. It became law, and the elections for the additional seats were held in July, after the close of the session. They resulted in strengthening the Progressive majority both in the House of Assembly and in the legislative council - where the Progressives previously had a majority of one only.

At the outset of its career the Jameson ministry had to face a serious financial situation. During the war the supplying of the army in the field had caused an artificial inflation of trade, and the Sprigg ministry had pursued a policy of extravagant expenditure not warranted by the finances of the colony. The slow recovery of the gold-mining and other industries in the Transvaal after the war was reflected in a great decline in trade in Cape Colony during the latter half of 1903, the distress being aggravated by severe drought. When Dr Jameson assumed office he found an empty treasury, and considerable temporary loans had to be raised. Throughout 1904, moreover, revenue continued to shrink - compared with 1903 receipts dropped from £11,701,000 to £9,913,000. The government, besides cutting down official salaries and exercising strict economy, contracted (July 1904) a loan for £3,000,000. It also passed a bill imposing a graduated tax (6d. to 1s. in the pound) on all incomes over £1000. A substantial excise duty was placed on spirits and beer, measures of relief for the brandy-farmers being taken at the same time. The result was that while there was a deficit on the budget of 1904 — 1905 of £731,000, the budget of 1905 — 1906 showed a surplus of £5161. This small surplus was obtained notwithstanding a further shrinkage in revenue.

Dr Jameson&#x27;s programme was largely one of material development. In the words of the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, &quot;without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a self-sustaining colony cannot be assured&quot;. This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of compulsory education. The cultivation of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies was also one of the leading objects of Dr Jameson&#x27;s policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to &quot;Het Volk&quot;, the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at Ceres, a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the Bond, Dutch sentiment and action throughout South Africa.

Native affairs proved a source of considerable anxiety. In January 1905 an inter-colonial native affairs commission reported on the native question as it affected South Africa as a whole, proposals being made for an alteration of the laws in Cape Colony respecting the franchise exercised by natives. In the opinion of the commission the possession of the franchise by the Cape natives under existing conditions was sure to create in time an intolerable situation, and was an unwise and dangerous thing. (The registration of 1905 showed that there were over 23,000 &quot;coloured&quot; voters in the colony.) The commission proposed separate voting by natives only for a fixed number of members of the legislature - the plan adopted in New Zealand with the Māori voters. The privileged position of the Cape native was seen to be an obstacle to the federation of South Africa. The discussion which followed, based partly on the reports that the ministry contemplated disfranchising the natives, led, however, to no immediate results.

Another disturbing factor in connexion with native affairs was the revolt of the Hottentots and Hereros in German South West Africa. In 1904 and the following years large numbers of refugees, including some of the most important chiefs, fled into British territory, and charges were made in Germany that sufficient control over these refugees was not exercised by the Cape government. This trouble, however, came to an end in September 1907. In that month Jacob Morenga, a chief who bad been interned by the colonial authorities, but had escaped and recommenced hostilities against the Germans, was once more on the British side of the frontier and, refusing to surrender, was pursued by the Cape Mounted Police and killed after a smart action. The revolt in the German protectorate had been, nearly a year before the death of Morenga, the indirect occasion of a &quot;Boer raid&quot; into Cape Colony. In November 1906 a small party of Transvaal Boers, who had been employed by the Germans against the Hottentots, entered the colony under the leadership of a man named Ferreira, and began raiding farms and forcibly enrolling recruits. Within a week the filibusters were all captured. Ferreira and four companions were tried for murder and convicted, (February 1907), the death sentences being commuted to terms of penal servitude.

As the result of an inter-colonial conference held in Pietermaritzburg in the early months of 1906, a new customs convention of a strongly protective character came into force on 1 June 1906. At the same time the rebate on goods from Britain and reciprocating colonies was increased. The session of parliament which sanctioned this change was notable for the attention devoted to irrigation and railway schemes. But one important measure of a political character was passed in 1906, namely an amnesty act. Under its provisions over 7000 ex-rebels, who would otherwise have had no vote at the ensuing general election, were readmitted to the franchise in 1907.

While the efforts made to develop the agricultural and mineral resources of the country proved successful, the towns continued to suffer from the inflation - over-buying, over-building and over-speculation - which marked the war period. As a consequence, imports further declined during 1906—1907, and receipts being largely dependent on customs the result was a considerably diminished revenue. The accounts for the year ending 30 June 1907 showed a deficit of £640,455. The decline in revenue, £4,000,000 in four years, while not a true reflection of the economic condition of the country - yearly becoming more self-supporting by the increase in home produce - caused general disquiet and injuriously affected the position of the ministry. In the session of 1907 the opposition in the legislative council brought on a crisis by refusing to grant supplies voted by the lower chamber. Dr Jameson contested the constitutional right of the council so to act, and on his advice the governor dissolved parliament in September 1907. Before its dissolution parliament passed an act imposing a profit tax of 10% on diamond- and copper-mining companies earning over £50,000 &quot;per annum&quot;, and another act establishing an agricultural credit bank.

==Merriman Premier==

The elections for the legislative council were held in January 1908 and resulted in a Bond victory. Its supporters, who called themselves the South African party (the Progressives being renamed &quot;Unionists&quot;), obtained 17 seats out of a total of 26. Dr Jameson thereupon resigned (31 January 1908), and a ministry was formed with Mr John X. Merriman as premier and treasurer, and Mr J. W. Sauer as minister of public works. Neither of these politicians was a member of the Bond, and both had held office under Cecil Rhodes and W. P. Schreiner. They had, however, been the leading parliamentary exponents of Bond policy for a considerable time. The elections for the legislative assembly followed in April and, partly in consequence of the re-infranchisement of the ex-rebels, resulted in a decisive majority for the Merriman ministry. There were returned 69 members of the South African party, 33 Unionists and 5 Independents, among them the ex-premiers Sir Gordon Sprigg and Mr Schreiner. The change of ministry was not accompanied by any relief in the financial situation. While the country districts remained fairly prosperous (agricultural and pastoral products increasing), the transit trade and the urban industries continued to decline. The depression was accentuated by the financial crisis in America, which affected adversely the wool trade, and in a more marked degree the diamond trade, leading to the partial stoppage of the Kimberley mines. (The &quot;slump&quot; in the diamond trade is shown by a comparison of the value of diamonds exported from the Cape in the years 1907 and 1908; in 1907 they were valued at £8,973,148, in 1908 at £4,796,655.) This seriously diminished the revenue returns, and the public accounts for the year 1907 — 1908 showed a deficit of £996,000, and a prospective deficit for the ensuing year of an almost equal amount. To balance the budget, Mr Merriman proposed drastic remedies, including the suspension of the sinking fund, the reduction of salaries of all civil servants, and taxes on incomes of £50 per annum. Partly in consequence of the serious economic situation, the renewed movement for the closer union of the various South African colonies, formally initiated by Dr Jameson in 1907, received the support of the Cape parliament. During 1907—1908 a national convention decided upon unification, and in 1910 the Union of South Africa was established and Cape Colony became &quot;Cape Province&quot; therein.

<text>The year 1870 in the history of the Cape Colony marks the dawn of a new era in South Africa, and it can be said that the development of modern South Africa began on that date. Despite political complications that arose from time to time, progress in Cape Colony continued at a steady pace until the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer Wars in 1899. The discovery of diamonds in the Orange River in 1867 was immediately followed by similar finds in the Vaal River. This led to the rapid occupation and development of huge tracts of the country, which had hitherto been sparsely inhabited. Dutoitspan and Bultfontein diamond mines were discovered in 1870, and in 1871 the even richer mines of Kimberley and De Beers were discovered. These four great deposits of mineral wealth were incredibly productive, and constituted the greatest industrial asset that the Colony possessed.

This period also witnessed the increasing tensions between the English-dominated Cape Colony and the Afrikaner-dominated Transvaal. These conflicts led to the outbreak of the First Boer War. These tensions mainly concerned the easing of trade restrictions between the different colonies, as well as the construction of railways.

==Socioeconomic background==
At the time of the beginning of the diamond industry, all of South Africa was experiencing depressed economic conditions. Ostrich-farming was in its infancy, and agriculture had only been lightly developed. The Boers, except those in the immediate vicinity of Cape Town, lived in impoverished conditions. They only traded marginally with the Colony for durable goods. Even the British colonists were far from wealthy. The diamond industry was therefore considerably attractive, especially to colonists of British origin. It was also a means to demonstrate that South Africa, which appeared to be barren and poor on the surface, was rich below the ground. It takes 10 acres (40,000 m2) of Karoo to feed a sheep, but it was now possible that a few square metres of diamondiferous blue ground would be able to feed a dozen families. By the end of 1871, a large population had already gathered on the diamond fields, and immigration increased dramatically, which brought in many newcomers. Among the first to seek a fortune on the diamond fields was Cecil Rhodes.

==The beginning of &quot;responsible government&quot;==

The Cape Colony was brought under &quot;responsible government&quot; in 1872. 
Under its previous political system, the government ministers of the Cape reported to the appointed British Governor of Cape Colony, and not to the locally elected Cape Parliament. A popular movement arose in the early 1860s, led by local leader John Molteno, to make the government of the country accountable (or &quot;responsible&quot;) to parliament and the local electorate, thereby gaining a degree of independence from Britain. 
Throughout most of the 1860s, the Cape was dominated by a political struggle between the British Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse, and the growing responsible government movement. The political deadlock was accompanied by economic stagnation and bitter regional divisions between the Cape&#x27;s provinces.

Finally in 1872, Molteno – with the backing of a new Governor Henry Barkly – instituted responsible government, making ministers responsible to Parliament, and becoming the Cape&#x27;s first Prime Minister. The ensuing years saw a rapid surge in economic growth, a country-wide expansion of infrastructure as well as a period of regional integration and social development.

Though the Confederation wars were soon to interrupt this new stability, the Cape remained under responsible government for the remainder of its history, until it became the Cape Province within the new Union of South Africa in 1910. An important point to be made about the political system of the Cape under responsible government, was that it was the only state of southern Africa to have a non-racial system of voting. In the following century however – after the Act of Union of 1910 to form the Union of South Africa – this multi-racial universal suffrage was steadily eroded, and eventually abolished by the Apartheid government in 1948.

==Failed attempt at confederation==

The idea of melding the states of southern Africa into a Confederation was not new. An earlier plan by Sir George Grey for a federation of all the various colonies in South Africa had been rejected by the home authorities in 1858 as not being viable. Later, the 4th Earl of Carnarvon, secretary of state for the colonies, having successfully federated Canada, drew up a new plan to impose the same system of confederation on the (very different) states of Southern Africa. 
Southern Africa, seen as vital for the security of the Empire, was only partially under British control at the time. Black African and Boer states remained uncolonised, and the Cape Colony had just attained a degree of independence.

Confederating the various states under British rule was seen as the best way of establishing overall British control with the minimum blood-shed, and ending the autonomy of the remaining independent states. The imposition of a federation upon Southern Africa was, however, doomed to failure and led to resentment across the region (culminating disastrously in the Anglo-Zulu War, the First Boer War and other conflicts).

===The Cape Colony&#x27;s response===

There was little local enthusiasm for the confederation project. Prominent Cape politicians, while acknowledging the success of the Confederation model in Canada, questioned its suitability for Southern Africa. They also criticised the timing of the scheme as particularly unfortunate – coming when the different states of Southern Africa were still unstable and simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion. 
The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno correctly warned that the imposition of a lop-sided confederation would cause instability and resentment. He advised full union as a better model for Southern Africa – but only at a later date, once it was economically viable and tensions had died down.

Direct British rule in the Cape Colony had recently been replaced by responsible government, and the newly elected Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope in Cape Town, under the liberal Molteno-Merriman government, resented the perceived high-handed manner in which Lord Carnarvon presented his proposals from afar without an understanding of local affairs. It also suspected him of manoeuvring to consolidate British control over the region&#x27;s states, reverse the Cape&#x27;s independence, and bring on a war with the neighbouring Xhosa Chiefs. Molteno&#x27;s government raised the additional concern, transmitted to London by Sir Henry Barkly, that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape&#x27;s black citizens; if there was to be any form of union, the Cape&#x27;s non-racialism would need to be implemented in the Boer republics, and could not be compromised. 
A resolution was passed in the Cape Parliament on 11 June 1875, stating that any scheme in favour of confederation must originate locally, from among southern African states, and not be imposed by London.

Lord Carnarvon responded by sending the distinguished historian James Anthony Froude to Southern Africa, with orders to push discreetly for confederation, test popular opinion about it and report all information directly back to Carnarvon. However, the general public in South Africa saw him as a representative of the British government and local suspicion of his agenda ensured that his trip was not a success; in fact he entirely failed to induce Southern Africans to adopt Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation system.

The Molteno Unification Plan (1877), put forward by the Cape government as a more feasible unitary alternative to confederation, largely anticipated the final act of Union in 1909. A crucial difference was that the Cape&#x27;s constitution and multiracial franchise were to be extended to the other states of the union. These smaller states would gradually accede to the much larger Cape Colony through a system of treaties, whilst gaining elected seats in the Cape parliament. The entire process would be locally driven, with Britain&#x27;s role restricted to policing any set backs. While subsequently acknowledged to be more viable, this model was rejected at the time by London.

Lord Carnarvon, still bent on imposing confederation on Southern Africa, now appointed his political ally Sir Bartle Frere as governor of Cape Colony and high commissioner of South Africa. Frere was appointed on the understanding that he would work to enforce Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation plan and, in return, he could then become the first British governor of a united southern African confederation.

Serious African insurrections began soon afterwards, in Zululand and on the Xhosa frontier of the Cape Colony. In 1876, the British had annexed Fingoland, the Idutywa reserve and other Xhosa lands, on the understanding that the Cape government should take them over and provide for their government, however there was a serious rebellion by the amaGcaleka and the amaNgqika (or Gaikas) and a considerable force of imperial and colonial troops was required to put down the uprising. The war was subsequently known as the Ninth Xhosa War and the famous Xhosa chief, Sandile, lost his life during its course. After the war ended, the Transkei (the territory of the Gcaleka tribe, who were led by Sarhili &quot;Kreli&quot;), was annexed by the British.

Frere&#x27;s dissolving of the elected Cape Government removed any constitutional obstructions to the colonial office&#x27;s confederation plan, but was overshadowed by growing unrest and anti-British agitation across the whole region.

===Anglo-Zulu and Anglo-Boer Wars===

The Transvaal had been brought under British control through a peacefully annexation from the south-east in 1877, under Sir Theophilus Shepstone. The remaining Xhosa Kingdoms had all been annexed, though upheavals continued. 
With the Cape government removed and a puppet Prime Minister (John Gordon Sprigg) installed, Frere turned to the Zulu Kingdom to the east, under its King, Cetshwayo. As an independent state, it needed to be brought under British control in order to be melded into the planned Confederation.

Frere impressed upon the Colonial Office his belief that Cetshwayo&#x27;s army had to be eliminated, an idea that was generally accepted until Frere sent Cetshwayo a provocative and impossible ultimatum in December 1878 and the home government began to realise the problems inherent in a native war. Cetshwayo was unable to comply with Frere&#x27;s ultimatum-even if he had wanted to; Frere ordered Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand, and so the Anglo-Zulu War began. Fourteen days later the disaster of Isandlwana was reported, and the House of Commons demanded that Frere be recalled. Beaconsfield supported him, however, and in a strange compromise he was censured but allowed to stay on. The Zulu trouble, and disaffection brewing in the Transvaal, reacted upon each other most disastrously. The delay in giving the country a constitution afforded a pretext for agitation to the discontented Boers, a rapidly increasing minority, while the reverse at Isandlwana had lowered British prestige. On his return to Cape Town, Frere found that his achievement had been eclipsed—first by 1 June 1879 death of Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial, in Zululand, and then by the news that the government of the Transvaal and Natal, together with the high commissionership for the south-eastern part of South Africa, had been transferred from him to Sir Garnet Wolseley. Meanwhile, Boer resentment had boiled over and full-blown rebellion broke out in the Transvaal, leading to the First Boer War(1880–1881) and the independence of the Boer republics.

While the war was being fought, Lord Carnarvon resigned his position in the British cabinet and his scheme for confederation was abandoned.

===Effects of the confederation wars===

Lord Carnarvon had failed to appreciate the geo-political differences between Canada and Southern Africa, and how inappropriate a Canadian-style confederation was for the Southern African political landscape. The timing of the scheme was also inauspicious, as at the time the relations between the different states of Southern Africa was still fragile after the previous wave of British imperial expansion.

A new wave of discontent spread amongst the different Xhosa tribes on the colonial frontier, and there was another uprising in Basutoland under Moirosi after the Gaika-Galeka War. The Xhosa under Moirosi were put down with severe fighting by a colonial force, but their defeat notwithstanding, the Basotho remained restless and aggressive for several years. In 1880, the British colonial authorities attempted to extend the Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, attempting a general disarmament of the Basotho. Further fighting followed the proclamation, which did not have a conclusive end, although peace was declared in December 1882. The imperial government took over Basutoland as a crown colony, on the understanding that Cape Colony should contribute £18,000 annually for administrative purposes. The authorities of the Colony were glad to be relieved in 1884 of the administration of Basutoland, whose administration had already cost them more than £3,000,000.

Sir Bartle Frere had been recalled in 1880 to face charges of misconduct, by the 1st Earl of Kimberley (secretary of state for the colonies). He was succeeded by Sir Hercules Robinson. Griqualand West, which included most of the diamond fields, also became an incorporated portion of Cape Colony.

A long-lasting consequence of the Confederation wars was the solidification of hostilities between the Boer and British inhabitants of southern Africa. These were later to feed into the far larger Second Boer War.

==Origin of the Afrikander Bond==
The disastrous end of the First Anglo-Boer War of 1881 had repercussions that spread throughout South Africa. One of the most important results was the first Afrikander Bond congress that was held in 1882 at Graaff-Reinet. The Bond developed to include both the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Cape Colony. Each country had a provincial committee with district committees, and branches were distributed through South Africa. Later on, the Bond in the Cape Colony dissociated itself from its Republican branches. The policy of the Bond is best summarised by an excerpt from &quot;De Patriot&quot;, a paper published in the colony and an avowed supporter of the Bond.

:&quot;The Afrikander Bond has for its object the establishment of a South African nationality by spreading a true love for what is really our fatherland. No better time could be found for establishing the Bond than the present, when the consciousness of nationality has been thoroughly aroused by the Transvaal war . . . The British government keeps on talking about a confederation under the British flag, but that will never be brought about. They can be quite certain of that. There is just one obstacle in the way of confederation, and that is the British flag. Let them remove that, and in less than a year the confederation would be established under the Free Afrikander flag.

:After a time the English will realise that the advice given them by Froude was the best – they must just have Simon&#x27;s Bay as a naval and military station on the way to India, and give over all the rest of South Africa to the Afrikanders . . . Our principal weapon in the social war must be the destruction of English trade by our establishing trading companies for ourselves . . . It is the duty of each true Afrikander not to spend anything with the English that he can avoid&quot;. (&quot;De Patriot&quot;. 1882.)

In addition to its press organs, the Bond published official statements from time to time that were less frank in their tone than the statements from its press. Some of the articles of the Bond&#x27;s original manifesto can be considered entirely neutral, e.g. those referring to the administration of justice, honouring people, etc. However, these clauses were meaningless in the view of the government in Cape Colony, for Article 3 on the manifesto advocated complete independence (&quot;Zelfstandieheid&quot;) for South Africa, which was tantamount to treason against the Crown.

If the Bond prompted disloyalty and insubordination in some of the Cape inhabitants, it also caused loyalty and patriotism in another group. A pamphlet written in 1885 for an association called the Empire League on the behalf of the Bond, stated the following: 
#That the establishment of the English government here was beneficial to all classes; and 
#that the withdrawal of that government would be disastrous to every one having vested interests in the colony. . . . England never can, never will, give up this colony, and we colonists will never give up England. Let us, the inhabitants of the Cape Colony, be swift to recognise that we are one people, cast together under a glorious flag of liberty, with heads clear enough to appreciate the freedom we enjoy, and hearts resolute to maintain our true privileges; let us desist from reproaching and insulting one another, and, rejoicing that we have this goodly land as a common heritage, remember that by united action only can we realise its grand possibilities. We belong both of us to a home-loving stock, and the peace and prosperity of every home in the land is at stake. On our action now depends the question whether our children shall curse or bless us; whether we shall live in their memory as promoters of civil strife, with all its miserable consequences, or as joint architects of a happy, prosperous, and united state. Each of us looks back to a noble past. United, we may ensure to our descendants a not unworthy future. Disunited, we can hope for nothing but stagnation, misery and ruin. Is this a light thing?&quot; 

From 1881 onwards, two contrasting political ideas developed in the Cape Colony regarding imperial expansion, universal suffrage and self-government. One idea, espoused by pro-imperialist politicians in the Cape such as Rhodes, called for imperial expansion into the remaining independent Southern African states and the ostensible granting of civil rights for every &quot;civilized&quot; man regardless of his ethnicity, under the supremacy and protection of the Crown. The other was nominally republican, but in fact exclusively oligarchic and Dutch. The policy of the extremists of this last party was summed up in the appeal, which President Kruger made to the Free State in February 1881, when he bade them: &quot;Come and help us. God is with us. It is his will to unite us as a people ... to make a united South Africa free from British authority.&quot;

The two actual founders of the Bond party were a German man named Borckenhagen who lived in Bloemfontein, and an Afrikaner named Reitz, who afterwards became the state secretary of the Transvaal. There are two recorded interview that show the true aims of the founders of the Bond from the very beginning. One occurred between Borckenhagen and Cecil Rhodes, the other between Reitz and T. Schreiner, whose brother later became prime minister of Cape Colony. In the first interview, Borckenhagen remarked to Rhodes: &quot;We want a united Africa,&quot; and Rhodes replied: &quot;So do I&quot;. Mr Borckenhagen then continued: &quot;There is nothing in the way; we will take you as our leader. There is only one small thing: we must, of course, be independent of the rest of the world.&quot; Rhodes replied: &quot;You take me either for a rogue or a fool. I should be a rogue to forfeit all my history and my traditions; and I should be a fool, because I should be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours.&quot; But as Rhodes said in Cape Town in 1898, &quot;the only chance of a true union is the overshadowing protection of a supreme power, and any German, Frenchman, or Russian would tell you that the best and most liberal power is that over which Her Majesty reigns.&quot; 

The other interview took place just as the Bond was being established. Being approached by Reitz, Schreiner objected to the fact that the Bond aimed ultimately to overthrow British rule and remove the British flag from South Africa. To this, Reitz replied: &quot;Well, what if it is so?&quot; Schreiner expostulated in the following terms: &quot;You do not suppose that that flag is going to disappear without a tremendous struggle and hard fighting?&quot; &quot;Well, I suppose not, but even &quot;so&quot;, what of that?&quot; rejoined Reitz. In the face of this testimony with reference to two of the most prominent of the Bond&#x27;s promoters, it is impossible to deny that from its beginning the great underlying idea of the Bond was an independent South Africa.

==Rhodes and Dutch sentiment==
Cecil Rhodes recognised the difficulties of his position and showed a desire to conciliate Dutch sentiment by considerate treatment from the outset of his political career. Rhodes was first elected as member of the House of Assembly for Barkly West in 1880 to a loyal constituency. He supported the bill permitting the use of Dutch in the House of Assembly in 1882, and, early in 1884, he was appointed to his first ministerial post as treasurer-general under Sir Thomas Scanlen. Rhodes had only held this position for six weeks when Sir Thomas Scanlen resigned. Sir Hercules Robinson sent him to British Bechuanaland in August 1884 as deputy-commissioner to succeed Reverend John Mackenzie, the London Missionary Society&#x27;s representative at Kuruman, who proclaimed Queen Victoria&#x27;s authority over the district in May 1883. Rhodes&#x27;s efforts to conciliate the Boers failed, hence the necessity for the Warren mission. In 1885, the territories of Cape Colony were farther extended, and Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Galekaland were formally added to the colony. Sir Gordon Sprigg became prime minister in 1886.

==South African Customs Union==

There was considerable unrest in Cape Colony in the period from 1878 to 1885 – sparked in part by the attempts of the Colonial Office to impose a system of confederation on the Southern African states, in a similar manner to the Canadian Confederation. In a short period of time, there was the Anglo-Zulu War, chronic troubles with the Basutos (which prompted the Cape to relinquish control of Basutoland to the imperial authorities) as well as a series of conflicts with the Xhosa which were followed by the First Boer War of 1881 and the Bechuanaland disturbances of 1884.

In spite of these drawbacks, the development of the country continued. The diamond industry was flourishing. A conference was held in London in 1887 for &quot;promoting a closer union between the various parts of the British empire by means of an imperial tariff of customs&quot;. At this conference, Hofmeyr proposed a sort of &quot;Zollverein&quot; scheme, in which imperial customs were to be levied independently of the duties payable on all goods entering the empire from abroad. In making the proposition, he stated that his objective was &quot;to promote the union of the empire, and at the same time to obtain revenue for the purposes of general defence&quot;. The scheme was found to be impractical at the time. But its wording, as well as the sentiments accompanying it, created a favourable view of Hofmeyr.

In spite of the disastrous failure of political confederation, the members of the Cape parliament set about establishing a South African Customs Union in 1888. A Customs Union Bill was passed and, shortly afterwards, the Orange Free State joined the union. There was the first of many attempts to get the Transvaal to join, but President Kruger, who was pursuing his own policy, hoped to make the South African Republic entirely independent of Cape Colony through the Delagoa Bay railway. The plan to create a customs union that included the Transvaal was also little to the taste of President Kruger&#x27;s Hollander advisers as they were invested in the plans of the Netherlands Railway Company, who owned the railways of the Transvaal.

==Diamonds and railways==
Another event of considerable commercial importance to the Cape Colony, and indeed to all of South Africa, was the amalgamation of the diamond-mining companies which was chiefly brought about by Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Beit and &quot;Barney&quot; Barnato in 1889. One of the principal and most beneficial results of the discovery and development of the diamond mines was the great impetus that it gave to railway expansion. Lines were opened up to Worcester, Beaufort West, Grahamstown, Graaff-Reinet, and Queenstown. Kimberley was reached in 1885. In 1890 the line was extended northwards on the western frontier of the Transvaal as far as Vryburg in British Bechuanaland. In 1889, the Free State entered into an arrangement with the Cape Colony whereby the main trunk railway was extended to Bloemfontein, the Free State receiving half the profits. Subsequently, the Free State bought at cost price the portion of the railway in its own territory. In 1891, the Free State railway was still farther extended to Viljoen&#x27;s Drift on the Vaal River, and in 1892 it reached Pretoria and Johannesburg.

==Rhodes as Prime Minister==

In 1889 Sir Henry Loch was appointed high commissioner and governor of Cape Colony after succeeding Sir Hercules Robinson. In 1890 Sir Gordon Sprigg, the premier of the colony, resigned, and a government under Rhodes was formed. Prior to the formation of this ministry, and while Sir Gordon Sprigg was still in office, Hofmeyr had approached Rhodes and offered to put him in office as a Bond nominee, but the offer was declined. When Rhodes was invited to take office after the downfall of the Sprigg ministry, however, he asked the Bond leaders to meet him and discuss the situation. His policy of customs and railway unions between the various states when added to the personal esteem which many Dutchmen at the time had for him, enabled him to undertake and to successfully carry out the business of government.

The colonies of British Bechuanaland and Basutoland were now included in the customs union between the Orange Free State and Cape Colony. Pondoland, another native territory, was added to the colony in 1894. The act dealt with natives who resided in certain native reserves and provided for their interests and holdings. It also awarded them certain privileges that they had hitherto not enjoyed, and also required them to pay a small labour tax. This was in many respects the most statesmanlike act dealing with natives on the statue-book. In the parliamentary sitting of 1895, Rhodes was able to report that the Act had been applied to 160,000 natives. The labour clauses of the act, which were not being applied, were repealed in 1905. The clauses had some success as they prompted many thousands of natives to fulfil their labour requirements to be exempted from the labour tax.

In other regards, Rhode&#x27;s native policy was marked by a combination of consideration and firmness. Ever since the granting of self-government, the natives had enjoyed the right to vote. An act passed in 1892, on Rhodes&#x27; insistence, imposed an educational test on applications who wanted to register to vote as well as creating several other restrictions on the native vote as there were fears that &quot;tribal&quot; natives would possibly &quot;endanger&quot; the current system of government.

Rhodes opposed native liquor trafficking and suppressed it entirely on the diamond mines at the risk of offending some of his supporters among the brandy-farmers of the western provinces. He also restricted it as much as he could on native reserves and territories. Nevertheless, liquor trafficking continued on colonial farms and to some extent on in native territory and reserves. The Khoikhoi were particularly fond of the drink as they had been almost completely demoralised from their military losses.

A little-known instance of Rhode&#x27;s keen insight in native affairs that had lasting results on the history of the colony is his actions in an inheritance case. After the territories east of the Kei River were added to the Cape Colony, an inheritance claim came up for trial. In accordance with the law of the colony, the court held that the eldest son of a native was his heir. This decision was strongly resented among the natives of the territory, as it directly contradicted native tribal law which recognised the great son, or the son of the chief wife, as heir. The government was threatened with further native rebellions when Rhodes telegraphed his assurance that compensation would be granted and that such a decision would never be made again. His assurance was accepted and tranquillity was restored.

At the end of the next parliamentary sitting after this incident occurred, Rhodes tabled a bill that he had drafted that was the shortest in the history of the House. It stated that all civil cases were to be tried by magistrates and that appeals could be launched to the chief magistrate of the territory with an assessor. Criminal cases were to be tried before supreme court judges on circuit. The bill passed with the effect that, inasmuch as the magistrates practised according to native law, that native marriage customs and laws, including polygamy, were legalised in the colony.

Sir Hercules Robinson was reappointed governor in 1895 and high commissioner of South Africa to succeed Sir Henry Loch. In the same year, Mr Chamberlain became secretary of state for the colonies.

==Movement for commercial federation==
With the development of railways and the increase in trade between Cape Colony and the Transvaal, politicians in both places began to debate forming a closer relationship. While acting as Premier of Cape Colony, Rhodes endeavoured to bring about the friendly gesture of commercial federation among the states and colonies of South Africa by means of a customs union. He hoped to established both a commercial and a railway union, which is illustrated by a speech he gave in 1894 in Cape Town:

:&quot;With full affection for the flag which I have been born under, and the flag I represent, I can understand the sentiment and feeling of a republican who has created his independence, and values that before all; but I can say fairly that I believe in the future that I can assimilate the system, which I have been connected with, with the Cape Colony, and it is not an impossible idea that the neighbouring republics, retaining their independence, should share with us as to certain general principles. If I might put it to you, I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country.&quot; 

President Kruger and the Transvaal government found every possible objection to this policy. Their actions in what became known as the Vaal River Drift Question best illustrates the plan of action that the Transvaal government thought best. A series of disagreements arose over the termination of the 1894 agreement between the Cape government railway and the Netherlands railway. The Cape government had advanced the sum of £600,000 to the Netherlands railway and the Transvaal government conjointly for the purposes of extending the railway from the Vaal River to Johannesburg. At the same time, it was stipulated that the Cape government have the right to fix the rate of traffic until the end of 1894, or until the Delagoa Bay-Pretoria line was completed.

The rate of traffic was fixed by the Cape government at 2d. per ton per mile, but at the beginning of 1895 the rate for the of railway from the Vaal River to Johannesburg was raised by the Netherlands railway to no less than 8d. per ton per mile. It is evident from President Kruger&#x27;s subsequent actions that these changes were based upon his personal approval with the goal of compelling traffic to the Transvaal to use the Delagoa route instead of the colonial railway. To compete with this very high rate, the merchants of Johannesburg began moving their goods across the Vaal River with wagons. In a direct response, President Kruger closed the drifts or fords on the Vaal River, preventing through-wagon traffic. This created an enormous block of wagons on the banks of the Vaal. There were several protests launched by the Cape government against the actions of the Transvaal because it was a breach of the London Convention.

President Kruger was not moved by these protests, and an appeal was made to the imperial government. The imperial government made an agreement with the Cape Government to the effect that if the Cape would bear half the cost of any necessary expedition, assist with troops, and give full use of the Cape railway for military purposes if required, a protest would be sent to President Kruger on the subject. These terms were accepted by Rhodes and his colleagues, of whom W. P. Schreiner was one, and a protest was sent by Chamberlain stating that the government regarded the closing of the drifts as a breach of the London Convention, and as an unfriendly action that called for the gravest of responses. President Kruger reopened the drifts at once, and stated that he would issue no further directives on the subject except after consultation with the imperial government.

Leander Starr Jameson made his famous raid into the Transvaal on 29 December 1895, and Rhode&#x27;s complicity in the action compelled him to resign the premiership of Cape Colony in January 1896. Sir Gordon Sprigg took the vacant post. As Rhode&#x27;s complicity in the raid became known, there was a strong feeling of resentment and astonishment among his colleagues in the Cape ministry who had been ignorant of his connections with such schemes. The Bond and Hofmeyr denounced him particularly strongly, and the Dutch became even more embittered against the English in Cape Colony, which influenced their subsequent attitude towards the Transvaal Boers.

There was another native uprising under a Bantu chief named Galeshwe in Griqualand West in 1897, but Galeshwe was arrested and the rebellion ended. Upon examination, Galeshwe stated that Bosman, a Transvaal magistrate, supplied him with ammunition and encouraged him to rebel against the government of Cape Colony. There was sufficient evidence to believe the charge to be true, and it was consistent with the methods the Boers sometimes used among the natives.

Sir Alfred Milner was appointed high commissioner of South Africa and governor of Cape Colony in 1897, succeeding Sir Hercules Robinson, who was made a peer under the title of Baron Rosmead in August 1896.

==Schreiner&#x27;s policy==

Commercial federation advanced another state in 1898 when Natal entered the customs union. A new convention was drafted at the time, creating a &quot;uniform tariff on all imported goods consumed within such union, and an equitable distribution of the duties collected on such goods among the parties to such union, and free trade between the colonies and state in respect of all South African products&quot;. Another Cape parliamentary election was held in the same year, which elected another Bond ministry under W. P. Schreiner. Schreiner remained as head of the Cape Government until June 1900.

During the negotiations that proceeded the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, feelings were running very high at the Cape. As the head of a party that depended upon the Bond for its support, he had to balance several different influences. However, as prime minister of a British colony, loyal colonists strongly felt that he should have refrained from openly interfering with Transvaal government and the imperial government. His public statements were hostile in tone to the policy that Chamberlain and Sir Alfred Milner pursued. The effect of Schreiner&#x27;s hostility is believed by some to have encouraged President Kruger in his rejection of the British proposals. In private, Schreiner directly used whatever influence he possessed to induce President Kruger to adopt a &quot;reasonable&quot; course, but however excellent his intentions, his publicly expressed disapproval of the Chamberlain/Milner policy did more harm than his private influence with Kruger could possibly do good.

Schreiner asked the high commissioner on 11 June 1899 to inform Chamberlain that he and his colleagues decided to accept President Kruger&#x27;s Bloemfontein proposals as &quot;practical, reasonable and a considerable step in the right direction&quot;. Later in June, however, Cape Dutch politicians began to realise that President Kruger&#x27;s attitude was not as reasonable as they had believed, and Hofmeyr, along with a Mr Herholt, the Cape Minister of Agriculture, visited Pretoria. After they arrived, they found the Transvaal Volksraad to be in a spirit of defiance and that it had just passed a resolution that offered four new seats in the Volksraad to represent the mining districts, and 15 exclusive burgher districts. Hofmeyr, upon meeting the executive, freely expressed indignation at these proceedings. Unfortunately, Hofmeyr&#x27;s influence was more than counterbalanced by an emissary from the Free State named Abraham Fischer who while purporting to be a peacemaker, practically encouraged the Boer executive to take extreme measures.

Hofmeyr&#x27;s established reputation as an astute diplomat and the leader of the Cape Dutch Party made him a powerful delegate. If anyone could convince Kruger to change his plan, it was Hofmeyr. The moderates on all sides of the issue looked to Hofmeyr expectantly, but none as much as Schreiner. But Hofmeyr&#x27;s mission, like every other such mission to induce Kruger to take a &quot;reasonable&quot; and equitable course, proved entirely fruitless. He returned to Cape Town disappointed, but not altogether surprised at the failure of his mission. Meanwhile, the Boer executive drafted a new proposal which prompted Schreiner to write a letter on 7 July to the &quot;South African News&quot;, in which while referring to his own government, he said: &quot;While anxious and continually active with good hope in the cause of securing reasonable modifications of the existing representative system of the South African Republic, this government is convinced that no ground whatever exists for active interference in the internal affairs of that republic&quot;.

The letter proved to be precipitate and unfortunate. On 11 July, after meeting with Hofmeyr after his return, Schreiner personally appealed to President Kruger to approach the imperial government with a friendly spirit. Another incident happened at the same time that caused public feeling to become extremely hostile towards Schreiner. On 7 July 500 rifles and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition were off shored at Port Elizabeth, consigned to the Free State government, and forwarded to Bloemfontein. The consignment was brought to Schreiner&#x27;s attention, but he refused to stop it. He justified his decision by saying that since Britain was at peace with the Free State, he had no right to stop the shipment of arms through the Cape Colony. However, his inaction won him the sobriquet &quot;Ammunition Bill&quot; among British colonists. He was later accused of a delay in forwarding artillery and rifles to defend Kimberley, Mafeking, and other towns in the colony. He gave the excuse that he did not anticipate war, and that he did not want to create unwarranted suspicions in the minds of the Free State government. His conduct in both instances was perhaps technically correct, but was much resented by loyal colonists.

Chamberlain sent a conciliatory message to President Kruger on 28 July, suggesting a meeting of delegates to consider the latest set of proposals. On 3 August, Schreiner telegraphed Fischer begging the Transvaal to accept Chamberlain&#x27;s proposal. Later, after receiving an inquiry from the Free State amount the movements of British troops, Schreiner curtly refused to disclose any information, and referred the Free State to the high commissioner. On 28 August, Sir Gordon Sprigg moved the adjournment in the House of Assembly to discuss the removal of arms from the Free State. In reply, Schreiner used expression which demanded the strongest possible censure of Sprigg possible, both in the colony and in Britain. Schreiner stated that should troubles arise, Sprigg would keep the colony aloof in regard to both its military and its people. In the course of his speech, he read a telegram from President Steyn in which the president repudiated all possible aggressive action on any part of the Free State as absurd. The speech created a scandal in the British press.

It is quite obvious from a review of Schreiner&#x27;s conduct through the latter half of 1899 that he was entirely mistaken in his view of the Transvaal situation. He demonstrated the same inability to understand the uitlanders&#x27; grievances, the same futile belief in the eventual fairness of President Kruger as premier of Cape Colony as he had shown when giving evidence before the British South Africa Select Committee into the causes of the Jameson Raid. Experience should have taught him that President Kruger was beyond any appeal to reason, and that the protestations of President Steyn were insincere.

<text>A tea bag or teabag is a small, porous, sealed bag or packet, typically containing tea leaves or the leaves of other herbs, which is immersed in water to steep and make an infusion. Originally used only for tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;), they are now made with other tisanes (&quot;herbal teas&quot;) as well.

Tea bags are commonly made of filter paper or food-grade plastic, or occasionally of silk cotton or silk. The tea bag performs the same function as a tea infuser. Tea bags can be used multiple times until there is no extraction left. Some tea bags have an attached piece of string with a paper label at the top that assists in removing the bag, while also displaying the brand or variety of tea. There are also special tea filters that can be used to pour loose tea into and brew it in a bag in a cup.

== History ==
Tea bag patents date from 1903 when Roberta Lawson and Mary McLaren, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were granted US patent 723287 for a Tea Leaf Holder, which they had filed in 1901. The first modern tea bags were hand-sewn fabric bags. Appearing commercially around 1904, tea bags were successfully marketed in about 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, a tea and coffee importer from New York, who shipped his silk tea bags around the world. A popular legend states that this was accidental; the loose tea was intended to be removed from the bags by customers, but they found it easier to brew the tea with the tea leaves still enclosed in the porous bags. The first tea bag packing machine was invented in 1929 by Adolf Rambold for the German company Teekanne.

The heat-sealed paper fiber tea bag was patented in 1930 by William Hermanson. The now-common rectangular tea bag was not invented until 1944. Prior to that, tea bags resembled small sacks.

==Production==

===Teas===
A broad variety of teas as well as other infusions like herbal teas, are available in tea bags. Typically, tea bags use fannings, the left-overs after larger leaf pieces are gathered for sale as loose tea, but some companies sell teabags containing whole-leaf tea.

=== Shapes and material ===
Traditionally, tea bags have been square or rectangular in shape. They are usually made of filter paper, a blend of wood and vegetable fibers related to paper found in milk and coffee filters. The latter is bleached pulp abaca hemp, a plantation banana plant grown for its fiber, mostly in the Philippines and Colombia. Some bags have a heat-sealable thermoplastic such as PVC or polypropylene as a component fiber on the inner tea bag surface, making them not fully biodegradable. Some newer paper tea bags are made in a circular shape.

Tetrahedral tea bags were introduced by the PG Tips brand in 1997. They are typically made of nylon, soilon (PLA mesh made from corn starch), or silk. Nylon is non-biodegradable, so silk is preferred by environmentalists. PLA on the other hand is biodegradable, but is not compostable.

Empty tea bags are also available for consumers to fill with tea leaves themselves. These are typically open-ended pouches with long flaps. The pouch is filled with an appropriate quantity of leaf tea and the flap is closed into the pouch to retain the tea. Such tea bags combine the ease of use of a commercially produced tea bag with the wider tea choice and better quality control of loose leaf tea.

==== Plastics ====
In 2017, Mike Armitage, a gardener in Wrexham, UK, found that tea bags left a plastic residue after being composted. He started a petition urging Unilever to remove plastic from bag production. In January 2018, Co-op Food announced that they were removing plastic from their own brand 99 tea bags in conjunction with their supplier Typhoo. In February 2018, PG Tips announced that their pyramid bags would now use corn starch adhesive in place of polypropylene.

Microplastics may be found in the tea meant for human consumption. A 2019 study showed that &quot;steeping a single plastic teabag at brewing temperature () releases approximately 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a single cup of the beverage&quot;. A 2021 study analyzed purportedly cellulose tea bags and found that 15 of the 22 bags tested also contained polyester, polyethylene or polypropylene, which are known to shed microplastic fibers. Although cellulose is considered to be biodegradable, the plastic components are not and release microplastics to the environment when composted.

==Recreational and practical applications==
Decorative tea bags have become the basis for large collections and many collectors collect tea bags from around the world. Tea bag collector clubs are widely spread around the world and members consist of people interested in items related to teas. Online collector clubs often include catalogs of tea bags, as well as collection tracking tools. In addition, tea bag collectors often collect other tea-related items such as labels. These websites also provide forums for discussions and trade arrangements between collectors.

Teabag folding began in the Netherlands and is often credited to Tiny van der Plas. It is a form of origami in which identical squares of patterned paper (cut from the front of tea bag wrappers) are folded, and then arranged in rosettes. These rosettes are usually used to decorate gift cards and it has become a popular craft in both the US and UK since 2000.

Soil scientists used standardized tea bags to measure the decomposition rate of organic materials in different soils.

<text>The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a telephone numbering plan for twenty-five regions in twenty countries, primarily in North America and the Caribbean. This group is historically known as World Zone 1 and has the telephone country code &quot;1&quot;. Some North American countries, most notably Mexico, do not participate in the NANP.

The concepts of the NANP were devised originally during the 1940s by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) for the Bell System and the independent telephone companies in North America in Operator Toll Dialing. The first task was to unify the diverse local telephone numbering plans that had been established during the preceding decades, with the goal to speed call completion times and decrease the costs for long-distance calling, by reducing manual labor by switchboard operators. Eventually, it prepared the continent for direct-dialing of long-distance calls by customers, first possible in 1951 and expanded across the nation during the decades following. AT&amp;T continued to administer the continental numbering plan and the technical infrastructure until the end of the Bell System, when administration was delegated to the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), a service that has been procured from the private sector by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has plenary control of local numbering resources. The FCC also serves as the U.S. regulator. Canadian numbering decisions are made by the Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium.

The NANP divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas (NPAs) which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly termed the area code. Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit telephone number unique only within its respective numbering plan area. The telephone number consists of a three-digit central office (or &quot;exchange&quot;) code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, which establishes an international numbering framework.

== History ==
From the Bell System&#x27;s beginnings in 1876 and throughout the first part of the 20th century, telephone networks grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by growing their subscriber bases, as well as enlarging their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with tie trunks. It was the responsibility of each local administration to devise telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth. As a result, the North American telephone service industry developed into an unorganized set of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various existing numbering plans to provide a unified, systematic concept for routing telephone calls across the nation, and to provide efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.

In October 1947, AT&amp;T published a new nationwide numbering plan in coordination with the independent telephone operators. The plan divided most of North America into eighty-six &quot;numbering plan areas&quot; (NPAs). Each NPA was assigned a unique three-digit code, typically termed &quot;NPA code&quot; or simply &quot;area code&quot;. These codes were first used in Operator Toll Dialing by long-distance operators in establishing calls via trunks between toll offices. The goal of automatic service required additional technical advances in the latest generation of toll-switching systems, completed by the early 1950s, and installation of new toll-switching systems in most numbering plan areas. The first customer-dialed direct call using an area code was made on November 10, 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey, to Alameda, California. Direct distance dialing (DDD) was introduced subsequently across the country. By the early 1960s, DDD had become commonplace in cities and most towns in the United States and Canada. By 1967, the number of assigned area codes had grown to 129.

The status of the network of the 1960s was reflected by a new name used in technical documentation: &quot;North American Integrated Network&quot;. By 1975, the numbering plan was referred to as the &quot;North American Numbering Plan&quot;, resulting in the well-known initialism &quot;NANP&quot;, as other countries sought or considered joining the standardization.

=== Foreign expansion ===
Although Bermuda and the Caribbean islands had been assigned the area code 809 as early as 1958 by the administrators at AT&amp;T, individual participating countries or territories had no autonomy over their numbering plan as they received centrally assigned central office prefixes that needed to be unique from those of other countries with the same area code. Regions in Mexico with high call volumes to and from the US were assigned functional area codes as early as 1963, for the purpose of call routing, but a nationwide system of participation in the NANP eventually failed.

During the decades following, the NANP expanded to include all of the United States and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and seventeen nations of the Caribbean. 

At the request of the British Colonial Office, the numbering plan was first expanded to Bermuda and the British West Indies because of their historic telecommunications administration through Canada as parts of the British Empire and their continued associations with Canada, especially during the years of the telegraph and the All Red Line system.

Not all North American polities participate in the NANP. Exceptions include Mexico, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the Central American countries and some Caribbean countries (Cuba, Haiti, the French Caribbean and the Dutch Caribbean, except for Sint Maarten). The only Spanish-speaking jurisdictions in the system are the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Mexican participation was planned, but implementation stopped after three area codes (706, 903, and 905) had been assigned, and Mexico opted for an international numbering format, using country code 52. The area codes in use were subsequently withdrawn in 1991.

The Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten joined the NANP in September 2011, receiving area code 721. Sint Maarten shares the island of St. Martin with the French Collectivity of Saint Martin which, like the rest of the French Caribbean, is not part of the NANP, using the country code +590.

== Administration ==
The NANP is administered by the &quot;North American Numbering Plan Administrator&quot; (NANPA, formerly &quot;Administration&quot;). This function is overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, which assumed the responsibility upon the federally mandated breakup of the Bell System. The FCC periodically solicits private sector contracts for the role of the administrator.

Before the breakup of the Bell System, administration of the North American Numbering Plan was performed by AT&amp;T&#x27;s Central Services Organization. In 1984, this function was transferred to Bell Communications Research (&quot;Bellcore&quot;), a company created by the divestiture mandate to perform services for the newly created local exchange carriers. On January 19, 1998, the NANPA function was transferred to the IMS division of Lockheed Martin in Washington, D.C. In 1999, the contract was awarded to Neustar, a company created from Lockheed for this purpose. The contract was renewed in 2004, and again in 2012. On January 1, 2019, Somos assumed the NANPA function with a one-year bridge contract granted by the FCC with the goal of consolidating the NANPA function with the Pooling Administrator and identifying a long-term contractor. On December 1, 2020, Somos secured the $76 million contract for a term of eight years against one other bidder.

== Numbering plan ==
The long-range vision of the architects of the North American Numbering Plan was a system by which telephone subscribers in the United States and Canada could themselves dial and establish a telephone call to any other subscriber without the assistance of switchboard operators. While the dialing of telephone calls by subscribers was common-place in many cities across the continent for local destinations, long-distance telephone calls had to be patched through manually by telephone operators at typically multiple intermediate toll offices using a system known since 1929 as the General Toll Switching Plan. The immediate goal for improvement in the time of call establishment was to provide technology for the originating toll operators to dial calls directly to the destination. This system was known as Operator Toll Dialing.

Operator Toll Dialing required a nationwide telephone numbering plan that unified all local numbering plans into a consistent universal system. Local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, needed to be expanded. but the goal was to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems.

===Numbering plan areas and central offices ===
The new numbering plan divided the North American continent into regional service areas, termed &quot;numbering plan areas&quot; (&quot;NPA&quot;s). The divisions conformed primarily to the jurisdictional boundaries of the U.S. states and the Canadian provinces. Some states or provinces needed to be divided into multiple areas. NPAs were created in accordance with principles deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize dialing effort, while reducing plant cost. Each NPA was identified by a unique three-digit code number, termed the &quot;numbering plan area code&quot;, which was prefixed to the local telephone number when calling from one NPA to another. Calling within the same numbering plan area did not require dialing the area code.

The telephone exchanges—in the Bell System they were officially termed &quot;central offices&quot;—became local exchange points in the nationwide system. Each of them was also assigned a three-digit number unique within its NPA. The combination of NPA code and central office code served as a destination routing code for use by operators to reach any central office through the switching network. Due to the numerical structure of the numbering system, each NPA was technically limited to 540 central offices.

Although the limitation to 540 central offices required the most populous states to be divided into multiple NPAs, it was not the sole reason to subdivide a state. An important aspect was the existing infrastructure for call routing, which had developed during preceding decades, often independently of state boundaries. The rules of determining areas also attempted to avoid cutting across busy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an NPA, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area. As a result, New York state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state. Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas were assigned four NPAs each, and California, Iowa, and Michigan received three. Six states (Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin) and two provinces (Ontario, Quebec) were divided into two NPAs.

Traditionally, central office switching systems were designed to serve as many as ten thousand subscriber numbers. Thus, subscribers were assigned four-digit line or station numbers. This rounded the total number of digits in a subscriber telephone number to ten: a three-digit area code, a three-digit central office code, and four digits for each line. This fixed format defined the North American Numbering Plan as a &quot;closed numbering plan&quot;, as opposed to developments in other countries where the number of digits was not fixed.

=== Initial numbering system ===
In 1947, AT&amp;T completed the new design for a nationwide toll network that established the original North American area codes. The new numbering plan provided for 152 area codes, each with a capacity to serve as many as 540 central offices. Originally, only eighty-six area codes were assigned. New Jersey received the first NPA code in the new system, area code 201. The second area code, 202, was assigned to the District of Columbia. The allocation of area codes was readjusted as early as 1948 before the implementation of the plan commenced. For example, the Indiana numbering plan area 317 was divided, which essentially provided a larger numbering pool in the Indiana suburbs of Chicago (area code 219).

Initially, states divided into multiple numbering plan areas were assigned area codes with the digit &quot;1&quot; in the second position, while areas that comprised entire states or provinces received codes with &quot;0&quot; as the middle digit. This rule was abandoned by the early 1950s, as NPAs with digit &quot;0&quot; in the middle had to be divided, beginning with New Jersey&#x27;s 201. However, all area codes assigned until 1995 had none other than the digits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; in this position.

The eight codes of the form &quot;N11&quot; (&quot;N=2–9&quot;) were reserved as service codes. The easily recognizable codes of the form &quot;N00&quot; were available in the numbering plan, but were not initially included in assignments. Additional area code patterns were later assigned for other services; for example, the area codes &quot;N10&quot; were implemented for the Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).

=== Central office codes ===
It was already common practice for decades that the digits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; could not appear in the first two digits of the central office codes, because the system of using the first two letters of familiar names for central offices did not assign letters to these digits. The digit &quot;0&quot; was used for operator assistance, and &quot;1&quot;, which is essentially a single pulse of loop interruption, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time. Therefore, the 0/1 rule for the area code provided a convenient means to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing.

The use of telephone exchange names as part of telephone numbers had been a well-established practice, and this was preserved for convenience and expediency in the new network design. The letter-to-digit translations were printed on the face of every rotary dial in the metropolitan areas, according to a scheme designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, that had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the early 1920s. The network reorganization standardized this system to using a two-letter and five-digit (&quot;2L-5N&quot; or &quot;2-5&quot;) representation of telephone numbers in most exchanges in North America, or to using an equivalent all-numeric seven-digit numbering plan, as was practiced by some independent telephone companies.

=== Dialing procedures ===
The closed numbering plan did not require the subscriber to dial all digits. When dialing a local call or a call within the same numbering plan area, the area code was omitted in seven-digit dialing. In some cases, even fewer digits sufficed for local calling. Ten-digit dialing was only necessary for &quot;foreign area&quot; calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area. Exceptions existed for communities on NPA boundaries, so that uniform local dialing was still possible in historically established communities.

=== All-number calling ===
All-number calling was a telephone numbering plan introduced in 1958, that converted telephone numbers with exchange names to a numeric representation of seven digits.

The original plan of 1947 had been projected to be usable beyond the year 2000. However, by the late 1950s it became apparent that it would be outgrown by about 1975. The limitations for the usable leading digits of central office codes, imposed by using common names for central office names, and their leading two characters as guides for customer dialing could no longer be maintained when opening new central offices. By 1962 it was forecast that in 1985 the number of telephones in the nation would equal its population of 280 million and increase to 600 million telephones for 340 million people in 2000. As a result, a few North American telephone administrations, notably New York Telephone Co., first introduced letter combinations that could not be associated with a familiar pronounceable central office name. Finally, they sought the elimination of central office names and letter codes, and introduced &quot;all-number calling&quot; (ANC).

The all-number calling plan increased the number of permissible central office prefixes from 540 to potentially 800, but the first two digits of the central office code were still restricted to the range &quot;2&quot; to &quot;9&quot;, and the eight combinations that ended in &quot;11&quot; were reserved as special calling codes. This expanded the numbering pool for central office codes to 640, and resulted in the partitioning of the prefix space (&quot;000&quot;—&quot;999&quot;).

=== Interchangeable central office codes ===
As the numbering plan grew during the 1960s using all-number calling, plan administrators at AT&amp;T identified that by some of the largest area codes in urban centers might run out of central office prefixes to install more individual access lines. For relief in these cases, they finally eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of the central office code could not be &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;. This resulted in the format of interchangeable central office codes, &quot;N X X&quot;, where &quot;N&quot;=&quot;2–9&quot; and &quot;X&quot;=&quot;0–9&quot;. The first cities that required this action, in 1974, were the cities of Los Angeles with area code 213 and New York with 212. This change also required modification of the local dialing procedures to distinguish local calls from long-distance calls with area codes.

Requiring &quot;1&quot; to be dialed before the full number in some areas provided for area codes of the form &quot;N10&quot;, such as 210 in the San Antonio, Texas, area and 410 in eastern Maryland. Therefore, someone calling from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles before the change would have dialed 213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area. The preceding &quot;1&quot; also ideally indicates a toll call; however, this is inconsistent across the NANP because the FCC has left it to the U.S. state public utilities commissions to regulate for traditional landlines, and it has since become moot for mobile phones and digital VoIP services that offer nationwide calling without the extra digit.

=== Interchangeable NPA codes ===
In 1995, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of an area code had to be either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, implementing fully interchangeable NPA and central office codes, that had already been anticipated since the 1960s, when interchangeable central office codes were sanctioned.

=== Modern plan ===
The NANP numbering format is summarized in the ten-digit notation &quot;NXX NXX-XXXX&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; denotes any of the digits &quot;2&quot;–&quot;9&quot;, and &quot;X&quot; denotes any digit &quot;0&quot;–&quot;9&quot;.
Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or central office code is invalid; these are trunk prefixes. &quot;9&quot; in the middle position of the NPA is reserved for North American Numbering Plan expansion.

For example, &quot;234 235-5678&quot; is a valid telephone number; with area code 234, central office prefix (exchange) 235, and line number 5678. The number &quot;234 911-5678&quot; is invalid, because the central office code must not be in the form N11. &quot;314 159-2653&quot; is invalid, because the office code must not begin with &quot;1&quot;. &quot;123 234-5678&quot; is invalid, because the NPA must not begin with 0 or 1.

Each three-digit area code has a capacity of 7,919,900 telephone numbers (7,918,900 in the United States).

Despite widespread use as fictional telephone numbers in the form &quot;NXX 555-XXXX&quot;, only line numbers &quot;0100&quot; through &quot;0199&quot; are reserved for this purpose, while &quot;1212&quot; and &quot;4334&quot; are the only assigned uses for directory assistance and other functions.

The country code for all countries participating in the NANP is &quot;1&quot;. The prefix digit &quot;1&quot; is also used within the NANP for long-distance dialing.

===Telephone number formatting===
NANP telephone numbers are formally rendered as &quot;NPA-NXX-XXXX&quot;, but &quot;(NPA) NXX-XXXX&quot; is common, as are others forms of punctuation. The parentheses were used originally to indicate that the area code was not necessary for local dialing. The &quot;NPA&quot;-part of the number has the formal format NXX, since 1995 identical to the format of central office codes.

The Government of Canada&#x27;s Translation Bureau also recommends using hyphens between groups; e.g. 250-555-0199.

Under the international formatting rules for telephone numbers, per recommendation E.164 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a NANP number is rendered as &quot;+1NPANXXXXXX&quot;, without spaces or punctuation, e.g., &quot;+12505550199&quot;. The plus sign indicates that the country code follows immediately and that the user may have to dial another prefix per the dialing conventions in the country of origin. This selects international network access. The NANP prescribes the prefix &quot;011&quot; for this purpose.

== Non-geographic services ==
The North American Numbering Plan recognizes the need for non-geographic services by designating certain numbering blocks for such purposes. Many of these telephone numbers are selected from the &quot;easily recognizable codes&quot; (ERCs).

System-wide toll-free calling, for which the receiving party is billed for the call, uses the number range with area codes of the form 8XX.

Area code and central office prefixes for other non-geographic services have the form 5XX-NXX. As of January 2021, the codes 500, 521, 522, 533, 544, 566, 577, 588, 523, 524, 525, and 526 have been designated. These codes are used for fixed or mobile devices, and not assigned to rate centers. As addresses, they may or may not traverse the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Applications include the use as personal 500 numbers.

Some carrier-specific services have used area code 700. In Canada, area code 600 is used for non-geographic applications. Area code 900 has been used for high-toll 900 numbers.

== Cellular mobile services ==
The North American Numbering Plan does not reserve special non-geographic area codes exclusively for cellular phones, as is customary in some other national telephone administrations. Only one regional exception exists in area code 600 in Canada.

For cellular services, telephone numbers in the NANP are allocated within each area code from central offices serving only cellular networks. Calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call in the same rate center. Consequently, the &quot;caller pays&quot; pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers may also be charged for receiving calls (&quot;subscriber pays&quot;). In the past, this has discouraged mobile users from publishing mobile telephone numbers, but in the 21st century, most users selected bundle pricing plans that included an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period, and most U.S. carriers since offer unlimited calling plans.

Local number portability between fixed and wireless services within a region allows users to switch to mobile service while keeping fix-line telephone numbers.

== Growth ==

Canada and the United States have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. The widespread adoption of fax, modem, and mobile phone communication, as well as the deregulation of local telecommunication services in the United States during the mid-1990s, increased the demand for telephone numbers.

The Federal Communications Commission allowed telecommunication companies to compete with the incumbent local exchange carriers for services, usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers. Because of the original design of the numbering plan and the telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider, number allocations had to be made in 10,000-number blocks even when many fewer numbers were required for each new vendor. Due to the proliferation of service providers in some numbering plan areas, many area codes were threatened with exhaustion of numbering resources. The number blocks of failed service providers often remained unused, as no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these numbers.

Area codes are added by two principal methods, number plan area &quot;splits&quot; and &quot;overlays&quot;. Splits were implemented by dividing an area into two or more regions, one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code. In an overlay, multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area, obviating the need for renumbering of existing services. Subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well, such as &quot;dedicated overlays&quot;, in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service, such as cellular phones and pagers, and &quot;concentrated overlays&quot;, in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code. The only service-specific overlay in the NANP was area code 917 (New York City) when it was first installed; such service-specific area code assignments were later prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission.

Most area codes of the form N10, originally reserved for AT&amp;T&#x27;s Teletypewriter eXchange (TWX) service, were transferred to Western Union in 1969 and were freed for other use in 1981 after conversion to Telex II service was complete. The last of these, 610, was assigned to Canada, but reassigned in 1992. These new area codes, as well as a few other codes used for routing calls to Mexico, were used for telephone area code splits during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as all other area codes using the original plan had been consumed.

After the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid growth in the need for more area codes forced the NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a &quot;last resort&quot; for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were area code 334 in Alabama and area code 360 in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was followed quickly by area code 520 serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.

By 1995, many cities in the United States and Canada had more than one area code, either from dividing a city into different areas (NPA split) or having more than one code for the same area (NPA overlay). The overlay method requires that the area code must be dialed in all cases, even for local calls, while the split plan may permit seven-digit dialing within the same area. The transition to ten-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase, which is widely publicized, during which dialing all ten digits is optional. After a period of several months, mandatory dialing begins, when seven-digit dialing is no longer permissible. Atlanta was the first U.S. city to require mandatory ten-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, coinciding roughly with the 1996 Summer Olympics held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it had the world&#x27;s largest fiber-optic network at the time, five times larger than that of New York, and it was home to BellSouth (now part of AT&amp;T), then the Southeastern Regional Bell Operating Company, with AT&amp;T&#x27;s fiber optics manufacturing facility within the city.

=== Growth problems ===
Depending on the techniques used for area code and central office code relief, the effect on telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and &quot;speed-dialing&quot; settings can retain the same telephone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary effect on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing ten-digit numbers when only seven-digit dialing was previously needed.

Dividing numbering plan areas instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory area code dialing within the new regions, but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code, which necessitates updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers. A transition period prior to splitting provides a period of &quot;permissive dialing&quot; during which seven-digit dialing is still permitted. Also, many splits involved significant technical issues, considering municipal boundaries and tributary trunking arrangements.

As an example, in 1998, the area code 612, assigned to the Minneapolis – Saint Paul Twin Cities, was divided to create area code 651 for St. Paul and the eastern metropolitan area. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries, which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries, and that all subscribers keep their seven-digit numbers. These two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the division, namely to provide additional telephone numbers. More than forty exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary. As a result, prefixes were duplicated in both area codes, which counteracted much of the benefit of the division, with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 transferring entirely to area 651. In less than two years, area code 612 again exhausted its supply of telephone numbers, and necessitated a three-way division in 2000, creating the new area codes 763 and 952. The division again followed political boundaries, rather than rate center boundaries, resulting in additional split prefixes; a few numbers were transferred from 612 to 651 to 763 in less than two years.

=== Decrease of growth rate ===
Recognizing that the proliferation of area codes was due largely to the telecom deregulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of ten thousand, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by Neustar, to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, number pooling was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable technical obstacle. Number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle, local number portability.

The program has been implemented in much of the United States by state regulators. Some cities have also implemented rate center consolidation; fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of telephone numbers, as carriers would reserve blocks of 1,000 or 10,000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area. (A rate center is a geographical area used by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) to determine the boundaries for local calling, billing and assigning phone numbers. Typically a call within a rate center is local, while a call from one rate center to another is a long-distance call.) Together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers, number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes, so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely.

Canada never implemented number pooling, so that even the smallest villages are rate centers and every Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers.

=== New area codes outside the contiguous United States and Canada ===
Before 1995, all NANP countries and territories outside the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Canada shared the area code 809. This included Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each has since been recognized as distinct numbering plan areas and area code 809 exclusively serves the Dominican Republic (along with area codes 829 and 849). The United States Pacific territories of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam joined the NANP in 1997, and American Samoa became an NANP member in October 2004. The Dutch possession of Sint Maarten was originally scheduled to join the NANP on May 31, 2010, but the changeover was postponed to September 30, 2011.

=== Telephone number length expansion ===

The NANP exhaust analysis estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient beyond 2049, based on the assumptions that a maximum of 674 NPAs continue to be available, and that on average 3,990 central office codes are needed per year.

In case of exhaustion, various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan. One option is to add the digit 1 or 0 either at the beginning or at the end of the area code, or prefixing it to the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require eleven-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. Another proposal introduces the digit &quot;9&quot; into the area code in the format &quot;x9xx&quot;, so that, for example, San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;415&quot; would become &quot;4915&quot;. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long-distance carriers or unused reserved services.

== Dialing procedures ==
The structure of the North American Numbering Plan permits implementation of local dial plans in each plan area, depending on requirements. When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes. Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, it may be necessary to prefix a telephone number with &quot;1&quot;. The NANPA publishes dial plan information for individual area codes.

The standard dial plans in most cases:
The number of digits dialed is unrelated to being a local call or a toll call when there is no toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dialing across an area code boundary, which was historically possible but is rare today, required central office code protection, locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides. Landlines occasionally require 1+10D where 10D is required, most notably in California.

Most areas permit local calls as 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all toll calls.

In almost all cases, domestic operator-assisted calls are dialed 0+10D.

=== Special numbers and codes ===

Some common special numbers in the North American system:
* 0 — operator assistance
* 00 — long-distance operator assistance (formerly 2-1-1)
* 011 — access code for international direct dialing all destinations outside the NANP
* 01 — international access code using operator assistance for all destinations outside the NANP
* 101-xxxx — Carrier access code for selecting an alternative long-distance carrier; xxxx is the carrier identification code (CIC).
* 211 — local community information or social services (in some cities)
* 311 — city government or non-emergency police matters
* 411 — local telephone directory service; some telephone companies provide national directory assistance.
* 511 — traffic, road, and tourist information
* 611 — telephone line repair service (formerly 4104), wireless operator customer service (formerly 811)
* 711 — relay service for customers with hearing or speech disabilities
* 811 — local utility location services (United States), non-urgent telehealth/teletriage services in Canada (formerly telephone company business office)
* 911 — emergency telephone number — fire department, medical emergency, police
* 988 — suicide prevention helpline
* 950-xxxx — Feature group code for access to a carrier from a non-subscriber location. The feature requires the customer dial a 950-xxxx number and enter a calling card number and destination telephone number. It was originally used for locations where 101-xxxx dialing was not possible.
* 958-xxxx (local); 959-xxxx (long distance) — Plant test numbers, such as automatic number announcement circuits. It was once common to reserve entire unused exchange prefixes or N11 numbers (4101 was ringback number on many step-by-step switches), but these have largely moved to individual unpublished numbers within the standard 958-xxxx (local) or 959-xxxx (long-distance) plant test exchanges as numbers become scarce.
* 1 (NPA) 555-1212 — non-local directory information (Canada and United States)

Vertical service codes are used for special calling features, such as:

* *51 and 1151 — a history of unanswered calls on a telephone number, useful for those who are not Caller ID subscribers
* *57 and 1157 — used to trace harassing, threatening, abusive, obscene, etc. phone calls, and keep results of trace at phone company
* *66 and 1166 — to keep retrying a busy-line (see also Called-party camp-on)
* *67 and 1167 — Caller ID Block
* *69 and 1169 — Call Return (caller may press &#x27;1&#x27; to return call after hearing number)
* *70 and 1170 — cancel call waiting on a call-by-call basis
* *71 and 1171 — three-way calling, which lets a person talk to people in two different locations at the same time
* *74 and 1174 — speed dial, which allows someone to quickly dial any of eight frequently called numbers using a one-digit code, from any phone on their line
* *75 — allows a total of 30 speed-call numbers with two digits
* *77 — activates Anonymous Call Rejection Service
* *82 and 1182 — releases Caller ID block on a call-by-call basis
* *87 — deactivates Anonymous Call Rejection Service

The four-digit numbers are not implemented in some areas. The star codes (*) are for use on Touch-Tone telephones, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are used on rotary dial telephones which cannot dial the * symbol.

Not all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the emergency telephone number is not always 911: Trinidad and Tobago and Dominica use 999, as in the United Kingdom. The country of Barbados uses 211 for police force, 311 for fire, and 511 for ambulance, while Jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for police force, and 110 for fire and ambulance services.

Despite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP&#x27;s codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones, the European Union has adopted its own standardized number of 112, while countries in Asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two- or three-digit emergency telephone number combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European GSM standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s 00 as their international access number instead of 011. However, the toll-free prefix 800 has been adopted widely elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the trunk prefix.

== International dialing ==
While direct dialing of international calls was available in some locations in the United States by the late 1950s, a continental system was introduced as
International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) for the territories of the North American Numbering Plan in March 1970.

IDDD was implemented through extensive modifications in the switching systems to accommodate the international &quot;open numbering plan&quot; with seven to twelve digits in the national telephone numbers. Access to the international network is facilitated by the dialing prefix &quot;011&quot;, after which the country code and the national telephone number are dialed.

== Number portability ==
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ( (b)(2)) authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require all local exchange carriers (LECs) to offer local number portability. The FCC regulations were enacted on June 27, 1996, with changes to take effect in the one hundred largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by October 1, 1997, and elsewhere by December 31, 1998.

The FCC directed the North American Numbering Council (NANC) to select one or more private-sector candidates for the local number portability administrator (LNPA) function, in a manner akin to the selection of the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA).

The toll-free telephone numbers in NPA 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833 have been portable through the RespOrg system since 1993.

==Toll charges==
Telephone calls between countries and territories of the NANP are not typically charged at domestic rates. For example, most long-distance plans may charge a California subscriber a higher rate for a call to British Columbia than for a call to New York, even though both destinations are within the NANP. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. destinations incur international rates. Even toll-free numbers may incur charges to callers. This is because many of the island nations implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local telephone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.

Because of these higher fees, scams had taken advantage of customers&#x27; unfamiliarity with pricing to call the legacy regional area code 809. Some scams lured customers from the United States and Canada into placing expensive calls to the Caribbean, by representing area code 809 as a regular domestic, low-cost, or toll-free call. The split of 809 (which formerly served all of the Caribbean NANP points) into multiple new area codes created many new, unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for U.S. or Canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs. In various island nations, premium exchanges such as +1-876-HOT-, +1-876-WET- or +1-876-SEX- (where 876 is Jamaica) became a means to circumvent consumer-protection laws governing area code 900 or similar U.S.-domestic premium numbers.

The occurrence of these scams has been decreasing, with many of the Cable and Wireless service monopolies being opened to competition, hence decreasing rates. Additionally, many Caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers.

== Countries and territories ==
Of all states or territories, the U.S. state of California has the largest number of area codes assigned, followed by Texas, Florida and New York, while most countries of the Caribbean use only one. Many Caribbean codes were assigned based on alphabetic abbreviations of the territory name, as indicated in the third column of the following table (&quot;Letter code&quot;). This follows the traditional letter assignments on telephone dials. For some Pacific islands, the NANPA area code is the same as the country code that was discontinued upon membership in the NANP.

While the United States and Canada generate substantial amounts of the tourists for the Caribbean, and are usually among the main international dialing destinations, most of the Caribbean was incorporated because companies such as Contel acquired Caribbean telecom systems following political independence from the United Kingdom.
Membership in the NANP still allows visitors between these countries to use familiar dialing procedures without international access codes.
Although NANP allows businesses within the member country to use the toll-free number system, most toll-free numbers to the United States and Canada remain barred from in the Caribbean unless paid as a toll call.

== Alphabetic mnemonic system ==

Despite the abandonment of telephone exchange names in telephone numbering plans, many telephone dials and keypads maintain a tradition of alphabetic dialing. Pushbuttons from digit 2 to 9 also displays letters, which is standardized in ISO 9995-8 and, in Europe, E.161. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as shown in the table.

The Glenn Miller tune &quot;PEnnsylvania 6-5000&quot; refers to telephone number PE6-5000, a number in service at the Hotel Pennsylvania (212 736-5000) in New York City until the hotel&#x27;s closing in 2020. Similarly, the movie &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot; is set in the East Side of Manhattan between roughly 64th and 86th Streets, where the telephone prefixes include 288.

The letter system was phased out, beginning before 1965, although it persisted ten years later in some places. It was included in Bell of Pennsylvania directories until 1983. Some businesses still display a 2L-5N number in advertisements, e.g., the Belvedere Construction Company in Detroit, Michigan not only still uses the 2L-5N format for its number (TYler 8-7100), it uses the format for the toll-free number (1-800-TY8-7100).

Despite the phasing out of the letter system, alphabetic phonewords remain as a commercial mnemonic gimmick, particularly for toll-free numbers. For example, one can dial 1-800-FLOWERS to order flowers, or 1-800-DENTIST to find a local dentist.

In addition to uses in advertising, alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the selection of area codes. For example, when area code 423 (East Tennessee) was split in 1999, the region surrounding Knoxville was assigned area code 865, chosen to represent &quot;VOL&quot;, for &quot;The Volunteer State&quot;, the nickname of Tennessee, as well as athletic teams at the University of Tennessee. Similarly, several Caribbean area codes were chosen as an alphabetic abbreviation of the name of the country or its capital.

== Fictional telephone numbers ==
American television programs and movies often use the central office code 555, or KL&quot;amath&quot; 5 and KL&quot;ondike&quot; 5 for older periods, in fictitious telephone numbers to prevent disturbing telephone subscribers if anyone dials a telephone number seen or referred to on screen. Not all numbers beginning with 555 are fictional. For example, 555-1212 is the standard number for directory assistance. Only 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional use. Where used, these are often routed to information services; Canadian telephone companies briefly promoted 555-1313 as a pay-per-use &quot;name that number&quot; reverse lookup during the mid-1990s.

Occasionally, valid telephone numbers are used as song titles. One of the earliest examples is the 1940 swing jazz tune &quot;Pennsylvania 6-5000&quot; written by Glenn Miller. The 1962 Motown hit &quot;Beechwood 4-5789&quot; was written by Marvin Gaye for The Marvelettes, while Stax/Volt Records&#x27; Wilson Pickett scored a soul music success during the 1960s with the similarly named &quot;634-5789&quot;. A more recent example is the 1981 song &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot; by Tommy Tutone, which was the cause of a large number of prank calls.

<doc id="214974" wikidata="Q1200427" url="?curid=214974" title="Culture of ancient Rome">
<text>The culture of ancient Rome existed throughout the almost 1,200-year history of the civilization of Ancient Rome. The term refers to the culture of the Roman Republic, later the Roman Empire, which at its peak covered an area from present-day Lowland Scotland and Morocco to the Euphrates.

Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, its famed seven hills, and its monumental architecture such as the Colosseum, Trajan&#x27;s Forum, and the Pantheon. The city also had several theaters and gymnasia, along with many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the territory under ancient Rome&#x27;s control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, there were imperial residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word &quot;palace&quot; is derived. The vast majority of Rome&#x27;s population lived in the city center, packed into Insulae (apartment blocks).

The city of Rome was the largest megalopolis of that time, with a population that may well have exceeded one million people, with a high-end estimate of 3.6 million and a low-end estimate of 450,000. A substantial proportion of the population under the city&#x27;s jurisdiction lived in innumerable urban centers, with population of at least 10,000 and several military settlements, a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards. The most urbanized part of the Empire was Italy, which had an estimated rate of urbanization of 32%, the same rate of urbanization of England in 1800. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum, temples and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome. The large urban population required an enormous supply of food, which was a complex logistical task, including acquiring, transporting, storing and distribution of food for Rome and other urban centers. Italian farms supplied vegetables and fruits, but fish and meat were luxuries. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and oil were imported from Hispania, Gaul and Africa.

There was a very large amount of commerce between the provinces of the Roman Empire, since its roads and transportation technology were very efficient. The average costs of transport and the technology were comparable with 18th-century Europe. The later city of Rome did not fill the space within its ancient Aurelian Walls until after 1870.

The majority of the population under the jurisdiction of ancient Rome lived in the countryside in settlements with less than 10,000 inhabitants. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. The plight of rural slaves was generally worse than their counterparts working in urban aristocratic households. To stimulate a higher labor productivity most landlords freed a large number of slaves and many received wages, but in some rural areas poverty and overcrowding were extreme. Rural poverty stimulated the migration of population to urban centers until the early 2nd century when the urban population stopped growing and started to decline.

Starting in the middle of the 2nd century BC, private Greek culture was increasingly in ascendancy, in spite of tirades against the &quot;softening&quot; effects of Hellenized culture from the conservative moralists. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls); chefs, decorators, secretaries, doctors, and hairdressers all came from the Greek East. Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, or were imitated in Roman sculpture yards by Greek slaves.

Against this human background, both the urban and rural setting, one of history&#x27;s most influential civilizations took shape, leaving behind a cultural legacy that survives in part today.

The Roman Empire began when Augustus became the first emperor of Rome in 31 BC and ended in the west when the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by Odoacer in AD 476. The Roman Empire, at its height (), was the most extensive political and social structure in Western civilization. By 285 AD, the Empire had grown too vast to be ruled from the central government at Rome and so was divided by Emperor Diocletian into a Western and an Eastern Roman Empire. In the east, the Empire continued as the Byzantine Empire until the death of Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. The influence of the Roman Empire on Western civilization was profound in its lasting contributions to virtually every aspect of Western culture.

==Social structure==

The center of the early social structure, dating from the time of the agricultural tribal city state, was the family, which was not only marked by biological relations but also by the legally constructed relation of &quot;patria potestas&quot; (&quot;paternal power&quot;). The &quot;pater familias&quot; was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife (if she was given to him &quot;cum manu&quot;, otherwise the father of the wife retained &quot;patria potestas&quot;), his children, the wives of his sons (again if married &quot;cum manu&quot; which became rarer towards the end of the Republic), the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen (liberated slaves, the first generation still legally inferior to the freeborn), disposing of them and of their goods at will, even having them put to death.

Slavery and slaves were part of the social order. The slaves were mostly prisoners of war. There were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Roman law was not consistent about the status of slaves, except that they were considered like any other moveable property. Many slaves were freed by the masters for fine services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation, although outrageous cruelty continued. In AD 4, the &quot;Lex Aelia Sentia&quot; specified minimum age limits for both owners (20) and slaves (30) before formal manumission could occur.

Apart from these families (called &quot;gentes&quot;) and the slaves (legally objects, mancipia, i.e., &quot;kept in the [master&#x27;s] hand&quot;) there were plebeians that did not exist from a legal perspective. They had no legal capacity and were not able to make contracts, even though they were not slaves. To deal with this problem, the so-called &quot;clientela&quot; was created. By this institution, a plebeian joined the family of a patrician (in a legal sense) and could close contracts by mediation of his patrician &quot;pater familias&quot;. Everything the plebeian possessed or acquired legally belonged to the gens. He was not allowed to form his own gens.

The authority of the &quot;pater familias&quot; was unlimited, be it in civil rights as well as in criminal law. The king&#x27;s duty was to be head over the military, to deal with foreign politics and also to decide on controversies between the gentes. The patricians were divided into three tribes (Ramnenses, Titientes, Luceres).

During the time of the Roman Republic (founded in 509 BC) Roman citizens were allowed to vote. This included patricians and plebeians. Women, slaves, and children were not allowed to vote.

There were two assemblies: the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; and the &quot;comitia populi tributa&quot;, which were made up of all the citizens of Rome. In the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; the Romans were divided according to age, wealth and residence. The citizens in each tribe were divided into five classes based on property and then each group was subdivided into two centuries by age. All in all, there were 373 centuries. Like the assembly of tribes, each century had one vote. The &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; elected the praetors (judicial magistrates), the censors, and the consuls. The &quot;comitia tributa&quot; comprised thirty-five tribes from Rome and the country. Each tribe had a single vote. The &quot;comitia tributa&quot; elected the quaestors (financial magistrates) and the patrician curule aedile.
Over time, Roman law evolved considerably, as well as social views, emancipating (to increasing degrees) family members. Justice greatly increased, as well. The Romans became more efficient at considering laws and punishments.

Life in the ancient Roman cities revolved around the Forum, the central business district, where most of the Romans would go for marketing, shopping, trading, banking, and for participating in festivities and ceremonies. The Forum was also a place where orators would express themselves to mould public opinion, and elicit support for any particular issue of interest to them or others. Before sunrise, children would go to schools or tutoring them at home would commence. Elders would dress, take a breakfast by 11 o&#x27;clock, have a nap and in the afternoon or evening would generally go to the Forum. Going to a public bath at least once daily was a habit with most Roman citizens. There were separate baths for men and women. The main difference was that the women&#x27;s baths were smaller than the men&#x27;s, and did not have a &quot;frigidarium&quot; (cold room) or a &quot;palaestra&quot; (exercise area). 

Different types of outdoor and indoor entertainment, free of cost, were available in ancient Rome. Depending on the nature of the events, they were scheduled during daytime, afternoons, evenings, or late nights. Huge crowds gathered at the Colosseum to watch events such as events involving gladiators, combats between men, or fights between men and wild animals. The Circus Maximus was used for chariot racing.

Life in the countryside was slow-paced but lively, with numerous local festivals and social events. Farms were run by the farm managers, but estate owners would sometimes take a retreat to the countryside for rest, enjoying the splendor of nature and the sunshine, including activities like fishing, hunting, and riding. On the other hand, slave labor slogged on continuously, for long hours and all seven days, and ensuring comforts and creating wealth for their masters. The average farm owners were better off, spending evenings in economic and social interactions at the village markets. The day ended with a meal, generally left over from the noontime preparations.

===Clothing===

In ancient Rome, the cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians (common people) like shepherds was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A magistrate would wear the &quot;tunica angusticlavi&quot;; senators wore tunics with purple stripes (&quot;clavi&quot;), called &quot;tunica laticlavi&quot;. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians.

The many types of togas were also named. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border, also worn by magistrates in office. The &quot;toga virilis&quot;, (or &quot;toga pura&quot;) or man&#x27;s toga was worn by men who had come of age to signify their citizenship in Rome. The &quot;toga picta&quot; was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The &quot;toga pulla&quot; was worn in mourning.

Even footwear indicated a person&#x27;s social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. Women wore closed shoes of colors such as white, yellow, or green.

The &quot;bulla&quot; was a locket-like amulet worn by children. When about to marry, the woman would donate her &quot;lunula&quot; to the household gods, along with her toys, to signify maturity and womanhood.

Men typically wore a toga, and women wore a stola. The woman&#x27;s &quot;stola&quot; was a dress worn over a tunic, and was usually brightly colored. A &quot;fibula&quot; (or brooch) would be used as ornamentation or to hold the stola in place. A &quot;palla&quot;, or shawl, was often worn with the &quot;stola&quot;.

===Food===

Since the beginning of the Republic until 200 BC, ancient Romans had very simple food habits. Simple food was generally consumed at around 11 o&#x27;clock, and consisted of bread, salad, olives, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat left over from the dinner the night before. Breakfast was called &quot;ientaculum&quot;, lunch was &quot;prandium&quot;, and dinner was called &quot;cena&quot;. Appetizers were called &quot;gustatio&quot;, and dessert was called &quot;secunda mensa&quot; (&quot;second table&quot;). Usually, a nap or rest followed this.

The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table. Later on, a separate dining room with dining couches was designed, called a &quot;triclinium&quot;. Fingers were used to take foods which were prepared beforehand and brought to the diners. Spoons were used for soups.
Wine in Rome did not become common or mass-produced until around 250 BC. It was more commonly produced around the time of Cato the Elder, who mentions in his book &quot;De agri cultura&quot; that the vineyard was the most important aspect of a good farm. Wine was considered a staple drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite cheap; however, it was always mixed with water. This was the case even during explicit evening drinking events (&quot;comissatio&quot;) where an important part of the festivity was choosing an &quot;arbiter bibendi&quot; (&quot;judge of drinking&quot;) who was, among other things, responsible for deciding the ratio of wine to water in the drinking wine. Wine to water ratios of 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4 were commonly used. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. &quot;Mulsum&quot; was honeyed wine, &quot;mustum&quot; was grape juice, &quot;mulsa&quot; was honeyed water. The per-person-consumption of wine per day in the city of Rome has been estimated at 0.8 to 1.1 gallons for males, and about 0.5 gallons for females. Even the notoriously strict Cato the Elder recommended distributing a daily ration of low quality wine of more than 0.5 gallons among the slaves forced to work on farms. 

Drinking non-watered wine on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign of alcoholism whose debilitating physical and psychological effects were already recognized in ancient Rome. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic—in the gossip-crazy society of the city bound to come to light and easily verified—was a favorite and damaging way to discredit political rivals employed by some of Rome&#x27;s greatest orators like Cicero and Julius Caesar. Prominent Roman alcoholics include Mark Antony, Cicero&#x27;s own son Marcus (Cicero Minor) and the emperor Tiberius whose soldiers gave him the unflattering nickname Biberius Caldius Mero (lit. &quot;Boozer of Pure Wine,&quot; Sueton Tib. 42,1). Cato the Younger was also known as a heavy drinker, frequently found stumbling home disoriented and the worse for wear in the early hours of morning by fellow citizens.

During the Imperial period, staple food of the lower class Romans (plebeians) was vegetable porridge and bread, and occasionally fish, meat, olives and fruits. Sometimes, subsidized or free foods were distributed in cities. The patrician&#x27;s aristocracy had elaborate dinners, with parties and wines and a variety of comestibles. Sometimes, dancing girls would entertain the diners. Women and children ate separately, but in the later Empire period, with permissiveness creeping in, even decent women would attend such dinner parties.

===Education===
Schooling in a more formal sense was begun around 200 BC. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking. Oratory was an art to be practiced and learned and good orators commanded respect; becoming an effective orator was one of the objectives of education and learning. Poor children could not afford education. In some cases, services of gifted slaves were utilized for imparting education. School was mostly for boys, but some wealthy girls were tutored at home; however, girls could still go to school sometimes.

==Language==
The native language of the Romans was Latin, an Italic language of the Indo-European family. Several forms of Latin existed, and the language evolved considerably over time, eventually becoming the Romance languages spoken today.

Initially a highly inflectional and synthetic language, older forms of Latin rely little on word order, conveying meaning through a system of affixes attached to word stems. Like other Indo-European languages, Latin gradually became much more analytic over time and acquired conventionalized word orders as it lost more and more of its case system and associated inflections. Its alphabet, the Latin alphabet, is based on the Old Italic alphabet, which is in turn derived from the Greek alphabet. The Latin alphabet is still used today to write most European and many other languages.

Most of the surviving Latin literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which became the Byzantine Empire, Greek was the main lingua franca as it had been since the time of Alexander the Great, while Latin was mostly used by the Roman administration and military. Eventually Greek would supplant Latin as both the official written and spoken language of the Eastern Roman Empire, while the various dialects of Vulgar Latin used in the Western Roman Empire evolved into the modern Romance languages still used today.

The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and over time Vulgar Latin evolved and developed various dialects in different locations, gradually shifting into a number of distinct Romance languages beginning in around the 9th century. Many of these languages, including French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish, flourished, the differences between them growing greater over time.

Although English is Germanic rather than Romanic in origin—Britannia was a Roman province, but the Roman presence in Britain had effectively disappeared by the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions—English today borrows heavily from Latin and Latin-derived words. Old English borrowings were relatively sparse and drew mainly from ecclesiastical usage after the Christianization of England. When William the Conqueror invaded England from Normandy in 1066, he brought with him a considerable number of retainers who spoke Anglo-Norman French, a Romance language derived from Latin. Anglo-Norman French remained the language of the English upper classes for centuries, and the number of Latinate words in English increased immensely through borrowing during this Middle English period. More recently, during the Modern English period, the revival of interest in classical culture during the Renaissance led to a great deal of conscious adaptation of words from Classical Latin authors into English.

Although Latin is an extinct language with very few contemporary fluent speakers, it remains in use in many ways. In particular, Latin has survived through Ecclesiastical Latin, the traditional language of the Roman Catholic Church and one of the official languages of the Vatican City. Although distinct from both Classical and Vulgar Latin in a number of ways, Ecclesiastical Latin was more stable than typical Medieval Latin. More Classical sensibilities eventually re-emerged in the Renaissance with Humanist Latin. Due to both the prevalence of Christianity and the enduring influence of the Roman civilization, Latin became western Europe&#x27;s &quot;lingua franca&quot;, a language used to cross international borders, such as for academic and diplomatic usage. A deep knowledge of classical Latin was a standard part of the educational curriculum in many western countries until well into the 20th century, and is still taught in many schools today. Although it was eventually supplanted in this respect by French in the 19th century and English in the 20th, Latin continues to see heavy use in religious, legal, and scientific terminology, and in academia in general.

==The arts==
===Literature===

Roman literature was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest works currently discovered are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the Roman Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy.
The Greeks and Romans had a tradition of historical scholarship that continues to influence writers to this day. Cato the Elder was a Roman senator, as well as the first man to write history in Latin. Although theoretically opposed to Greek influence, Cato the Elder wrote the first Greek inspired rhetorical textbook in Latin (91), and combined strains of Greek and Roman history into a method combining both. One of Cato the Elder&#x27;s great historical achievements was the &quot;Origines&quot;, which chronicles the story of Rome from Aeneas to his own day, but this document is now lost. In the second and early first centuries BC an attempt was made, led by Cato the Elder, to use the records and traditions that were preserved, in order to reconstruct the entire past of Rome. The historians engaged in this task are often referred to as the &quot;Annalists&quot;, implying that their writings more or less followed chronological order.

In 123 BC, an official endeavor was made to provide a record of the whole of Roman history. This work filled eighty books and was known as the &quot;Annales maximi&quot;. The composition recorded the official events of the State, such as elections and commands, civic, provincial and cult business, set out in formal arrangements year by year. During the reign of the early emperors of Rome there was a golden age of historical literature. Works such as the &quot;Histories&quot; of Tacitus, the &quot;Gallic Wars&quot; by Julius Caesar and &quot;History of Rome&quot; by Livy have been passed down through generations. Unfortunately, in the case of Livy, much of the script has been lost and it is left with a few specific areas: the founding of the city, the war with Hannibal, and its aftermath.

In the ancient world, poetry usually played a far more important part of daily life than it does today. In general, educated Greeks and Romans thought of poetry as playing a much more fundamental part of life than in modern times. Initially in Rome poetry was not considered a suitable occupation for important citizens, but the attitude changed in the second and first centuries BC. In Rome poetry considerably preceded prose writing in date. As Aristotle pointed out, poetry was the first sort of literature to arouse people&#x27;s interest in questions of style. The importance of poetry in the Roman Empire was so strong that Quintilian, the greatest authority on education, wanted secondary schools to focus on the reading and teaching of poetry, leaving prose writings to what would now be referred to as the university stage. Virgil represents the pinnacle of Roman epic poetry. His &quot;Aeneid&quot; was produced at the request of Maecenas and tells the story of flight of Aeneas from Troy and his settlement of the city that would become Rome. Lucretius, in his &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, attempted to explicate science in an epic poem. Some of his science seems remarkably modern, but other ideas, especially his theory of light, are no longer accepted. Later Ovid produced his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, written in dactylic hexameter verse, the meter of epic, attempting a complete mythology from the creation of the earth to his own time. He unifies his subject matter through the theme of metamorphosis. It was noted in classical times that Ovid&#x27;s work lacked the &quot;gravitas&quot; possessed by traditional epic poetry.

Catullus and the associated group of Neoteric poets produced poetry following the Alexandrian model, which experimented with poetic forms challenging tradition. Catullus was also the first Roman poet to produce love poetry, seemingly autobiographical, which depicts an affair with a woman called Lesbia. Under the reign of the Emperor Augustus, Horace continued the tradition of shorter poems, with his &quot;Odes&quot; and &quot;Epodes&quot;. Martial, writing under the Emperor Domitian, was a famed author of epigrams, poems which were often abusive and censured public figures.
Roman prose developed its sonority, dignity, and rhythm in persuasive speech. Rhetoric had already been key to many great achievements in Athens, so after studying the Greeks the Romans ranked oratory highly as a subject and a profession. Written speeches were some of the first forms of prose writing in ancient Rome, and other forms of prose writing in the future were influenced by this. Sixteen books of Cicero&#x27;s letters have survived, all published after Cicero&#x27;s death by his secretary, Tito. The letters provide a look at the social life in the days of the falling republic, providing pictures of the personalities of this epoch. The letters of Cicero are vast and varied, and provide pictures of the personalities of this epoch. Cicero&#x27;s personality is most clearly revealed, emerging as a vain vacillating, snobbish man. Cicero&#x27;s passion for the public life of the capital also emerges from his letters, most clearly when he was in exile and when he took on a provincial governorship in Asia Minor. The letters also contain much about Cicero&#x27;s family life, and its political and financial complications.

Roman philosophical treatises have had great influence on the world, but the original thinking came from the Greeks. Roman philosophical writings are rooted in four &#x27;schools&#x27; from the age of the Hellenistic Greeks. The four &#x27;schools&#x27; were that of the Epicureans, Stoics, Peripatetics, and the Academy. Epicureans believed in the guidance of the senses, and identified the supreme goal of life to be happiness, or the absence of pain. Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium, who taught that virtue was the supreme good, creating a new sense of ethical urgency. The Peripatetics were followers of Aristotle, guided by his science and philosophy. The Academy was founded by Plato and was based on the Sceptic Pyro&#x27;s idea that real knowledge could be acquired. The Academy also presented criticisms of the Epicurean and Stoic schools of philosophy.

The genre of satire was traditionally regarded as a Roman innovation, and satires were written by, among others, Juvenal and Persius. Some of the most popular plays of the early Republic were comedies, especially those of Terence, a freed Roman slave captured during the First Punic War.

A great deal of the literary work produced by Roman authors in the early Republic was political or satirical in nature. The rhetorical works of Cicero, a self-distinguished linguist, translator, and philosopher, in particular, were popular. In addition, Cicero&#x27;s personal letters are considered to be one of the best bodies of correspondence recorded in antiquity.

===Visual art===
Most early Roman painting styles show Etruscan influences, particularly in the practice of political painting. In the 3rd century BC, Greek art taken as booty from wars became popular, and many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists. Evidence from the remains at Pompeii shows diverse influence from cultures spanning the Roman world.

An early Roman style of note was &quot;Incrustation&quot;, in which the interior walls of houses were painted to resemble colored marble. Another style consisted of painting interiors as open landscapes, with highly detailed scenes of plants, animals, and buildings.

Portrait sculpture during the period utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. During the Antonine and Severan periods, more ornate hair and bearding became prevalent, created with deeper cutting and drilling. Advancements were also made in relief sculptures, usually depicting Roman victories.

===Music===
Music was a major part of everyday life in ancient Rome. Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres.

Some of the instruments used in Roman music are the tuba, cornu, aulos, askaules, flute, panpipes, lyre, lute, cithara, tympanum, drums, hydraulis and the sistrum.

===Architecture===

In its initial stages, the ancient Roman architecture reflected elements of architectural styles of the Etruscans and the Greeks. Over a period of time, the style was modified in tune with their urban requirements, and civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than two thousand years some ancient Roman structures still stand magnificently, like the Pantheon (with one of the largest single span domes in the world) located in the business district of today&#x27;s Rome.

The architectural style of the capital city of ancient Rome was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence, like the Verona Arena, Verona, Italy; Arch of Hadrian, Athens, Greece; Temple of Hadrian, Ephesus, Turkey; a Theatre at Orange, France; and at several other locations, for example, Lepcis Magna, located in Libya. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Palaces, private dwellings and villas, were elaborately designed and town planning was comprehensive with provisions for different activities by the urban resident population, and for countless migratory population of travelers, traders and visitors passing through their cities. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a 1st-century BC Roman architect&#x27;s treatise &quot;De architectura&quot;, with various sections, dealing with urban planning, building materials, temple construction, public and private buildings, and hydraulics, remained a classic text until the Renaissance.

==Sports and entertainment==
The ancient city of Rome had a place called the Campus, a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers, which was located near the Tiber. Later, the Campus became Rome&#x27;s track and field playground, which even Julius Caesar and Augustus were said to have frequented. Imitating the Campus in Rome, similar grounds were developed in several other urban centers and military settlements.
In the Campus, the youth assembled to play, exercise, and indulge in appropriate sports, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Riding, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastimes also included fishing and hunting. Females did not participate in these activities. Ball playing was a popular sport and ancient Romans had several ball games, which included handball (&quot;expulsim ludere&quot;), field hockey, catch, and some form of football.

Board games played in ancient Rome included dice (tesserae or tali), Roman chess (latrunculi), Roman checkers (Calculi), tic-tac-toe (terni lapilli), and ludus duodecim scriptorum and tabula, predecessors of backgammon.

There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot racing, musical and theatrical performances, public executions and gladiatorial combat. In the Colosseum, Rome&#x27;s amphitheatre, 60,000 persons could be accommodated. There are also accounts of the Colosseum&#x27;s floor being flooded to hold mock naval battles for the public to watch.

In addition to these, Romans also spent their share of time in bars and brothels, and graffiti carved into the walls of these buildings was common. Based on the number of messages found on bars, brothels, and bathhouses, it&#x27;s clear that they were popular places of leisure and people spent a deal of time there. The walls of the rooms in the lupanar, one of the only known remaining brothels in Pompeii, are covered in graffiti in a multitude of languages, showcasing how multicultural ancient Rome was.

==Religion==

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety &quot;(pietas)&quot; in maintaining good relations with the Gods. According to legendary history, most of Rome&#x27;s religious institutions could be traced to its founders, particularly Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second King of Rome, who negotiated directly with the Gods. This archaic religion was the foundation of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot; or simply &quot;tradition,&quot; viewed as central to Roman identity.

The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the elite classes. There was no principle analogous to &quot;separation of church and state&quot; in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), the same men who were elected public officials served as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.

Roman religion was thus mightily pragmatic and contractual, based on the principle of &quot;do ut des&quot; (&quot;I give that you might give&quot;). Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome&#x27;s intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order.

For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family&#x27;s domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial Era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to religious festivals and games (&quot;ludi)&quot;. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome&#x27;s most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestal Virgins, who tended Rome&#x27;s sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.

The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.

Mystery religions imported from the Near East (Ptolemaic Egypt, Persia and Mesopotamia), which offered initiates salvation through a personal God and eternal life after the death, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one&#x27;s family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;magic,&quot; conspiracy (&quot;coniuratio&quot;), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the Senate&#x27;s efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC.

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.

One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces (among them Cybele, Isis, Osiris, Serapis, Epona), and Gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.

In the wake of the Republic&#x27;s collapse, State religion had adapted to support the new regime of the Emperors. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows formerly made for the security of the Republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the Emperor. So-called &quot;Emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the &quot;Genius&quot;, the divine tutelary of every individual. Imperial cult became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire: rejection of the State religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome&#x27;s conflict with Christianity, which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and threat to the stability of the Empire, causing the prosecution of anti-Christian policies; under Emperor Trajan&#x27;s reign (AD 98–117), Roman intellectuals and functionaries (Lucian of Samosata, Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny the Younger, and Celsus) gained knowledge about the Jewish roots of Early Christians, therefore many of them considered Christianity to be some sort of &quot;superstitio Iudaica&quot;.

From the 2nd century onward, the Church Fathers began to condemn the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire collectively as &quot;Pagan.&quot; In the early 4th century, Constantine the Great and his half-brother Licinius stipulated an agreement known as the Edict of Milan (313), which granted liberty to all religions to be freely practiced in the Roman Empire; following the Edict&#x27;s proclamation, the conflict between the two Emperors exacerbated, ending with the execution of both Licinius and the co-Emperor Sextus Martinianus as ordered by Constantine after Licinius&#x27; defeat in the Battle of Chrysopolis (324).
Constantine ruled the Roman Empire as sole emperor for the remainder of his reign. Some scholars allege that his main objective was to gain unanimous approval and submission to his authority from all classes, and therefore chose Christianity to conduct his political propaganda, believing that it was the most appropriate religion that could fit with the Imperial cult (see also Sol Invictus). Regardless, under Constantine&#x27;s rule Christianity expanded throughout the Empire, launching the era of Christian Church&#x27;s dominance under the Constantinian dynasty. However, if Constantine himself sincerely converted to Christian religion or remained loyal to Paganism is still a matter of debate between scholars (see also Constantine&#x27;s Religious policy). His formal conversion to Christianity in 312 is almost universally acknowledged among historians, despite that he was baptized only on his deathbed by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia (337); the real reasons behind it remain unknown and are debated too. According to Hans Pohlsander, Professor Emeritus of History at the University at Albany, SUNY, Constantine&#x27;s conversion was just another instrument of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; in his hands meant to serve his political interest in keeping the Empire united under his control:

The Emperor and Neoplatonic philosopher Julian the Apostate made a short-lived attempt to restore traditional religion and Paganism, and to reaffirm the special status of Judaism, but in 391, under Theodosius I, Nicene Christianity became the official State church of the Roman Empire to the exclusion of all other Christian churches and Hellenistic religions, including Roman religion itself. Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus (d. 402) were rejected, and Christian monotheism became a feature of Imperial domination. Heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, but, despite the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism, Rome&#x27;s original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian religion as a whole; various pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived as well in Christian festivals and local traditions.

==Philosophy==

Ancient Roman philosophy was heavily influenced by the ancient Greeks and the schools of Hellenistic philosophy; however, unique developments in philosophical schools of thought occurred during the Roman period as well. Interest in philosophy was first excited at Rome in 155 BC. by an Athenian embassy consisting of the Academic Skeptic Carneades, the Stoic Diogenes, and the Peripatetic Critolaus.

During this time Athens declined as an intellectual center of thought while new sites such as Alexandria and Rome hosted a variety of philosophical discussion.

<text>Greeks had settled in Southern Italy and Sicily since the 8th century BC. In this way, Italian tribes came into contact with Greek culture very early on and were influenced by it. The alphabet, weights and measures, and temples were derived from the Greeks.

==Early influence==

The Romans came into contact with Greek culture during the conquest of Magna Graecia, Mainland Greece and the &quot;Hellenistic countries&quot; (countries that had been marked by Greek culture and language) in the 2nd and the 1st centuries BC. The Romans, who had defeated Carthage but were still a society of peasants, saw in Hellenistic cities that daily life could be more comfortable than theirs. Formerly sparsely-ornamented houses acquired columns, statues, mosaics on the floors, tapestries and paintings on the walls. One did not have dinner while sitting anymore, but while reclining, according to Greek custom.

The Romans gained from the Greek influence in other areas: trade, banking, administration, art, literature, philosophy and earth science. In the last century BC it was a must for every rich young man to study in Athens or Rhodes and perfect their knowledge of rhetoric at the large schools of philosophy. It was also a must to speak Greek as well as Latin.

There were some who resisted this Greek influence on every aspect of life. For example, Cato the Elder prophesied Rome&#x27;s demise; he considered everything Greek to be suspect; he even mistrusted Greek doctors and claimed that they only wanted to poison Romans. Roman writings frequently stereotyped the Greeks as untrustworthy, debauched and overly luxurious. Roman aristocrats warned of Greek influences corrupting Roman morals or Roman religious piety, and believed that excessive imitation of the &quot;Graeculus&quot; &quot;Greekling&quot; (a Roman slur for Greeks popularised by Cicero) would lead to the collapse of Rome. These views did not prevent the same anti-Greek Romans from adopting some elements of Greek culture and intellectual life, although some like Cato the Elder and Gaius Marius would refuse to use Greek in official capacity. According to Cassius Dio, a Roman from the East, Romans typically used the term &quot;Graecus&quot; as a negative reference to the lowly origin of a Greek person. Emperor Julian, who considered himself culturally Greek and praised Hellenization as the foundation of the Roman Empire, was himself mocked as a &quot;Graeculus&quot; and a pretentious fraud by Roman troops from the Western provinces. 

Indeed, some Greeks might have had every reason to hate the Romans, who had devastated their home, robbed temples and public buildings, decimated the population and brought many Greeks to Rome as slaves.
Aemilius Paulus, the victor of the Battle of Pydna in Greece in 168 BC, is said to have sold 150,000 Greeks to Rome as slaves all by himself.

Roman culture itself was Graeco-Roman from the start and matched the Greeks in terms of culture and civilization, partly because of the Greeks who voluntarily or involuntarily fought in Rome.

Greek cities like Ephesus or Athens flourished during the long era of peace (Pax Romana) more than ever. Though Greek, cities like Ephesus were not explicitly distinctive from Roman cities.
Because of the general prosperity, there was no revolt against Roman rule, which was even seen as positive. Although Greeks and Romans were friendly due to their similarities, they both liked to differentiate themselves, often through language, customs, and literature.

== Late antiquity ==
By late antiquity, the division of the two parts of the Roman Empire began to accelerate. This was mainly due to the introduction of Christianity and differences between the weakened and disorderly Latin West and the more prosperous Greek East. In Constantinople, the center of the Greek East, one could find Greek-speaking poets and historians referring to Rome as a foreign city full of vice, corruption, and decadence.

The situation of the Romans and Rome began to change rapidly and many local Roman traditions disappeared. It was common to hear Barbarian languages in the Italian peninsula and to hear Greek in Rome, largely because the Greeks dominated the economic life of Rome. This dependence caused tension with the Romans, so in 440 the western emperor Valentinian III decided to expel &quot;all the Greek merchants&quot; from the city. This caused a total famine which forced Valentinian to withdraw the edict. Depending only on militias armed by the upper classes, trade routes in the West were almost non-existent due to the insecurity of the routes, this plus different key factors such as the frequent use of barbarians in the Roman army over time would lead to the fall of Rome in 476 after much looting in Rome itself and the Italian peninsula. 

The effects of the Fall of the Western Roman Empire for the Romans who remained in the city or in Italy ranged from bad to devastating, classical Roman education was almost extinct, the upper classes were able to endure and retain their positions in the Ostrogothic kingdom that after all had adopted many of the Roman institutions. Even so, the fate of the common Romans was harsher, many of them had been forced to pay taxes and contribute with supplies. The most unfortunate were sold as slaves or killed in the frequent looting of cities or sieges, and many native Italic-Roman villages were forced to live alongside many barbarians sharing lands with frequent conflict.

== Justinian&#x27;s reconquest ==
After recapturing Rome and parts of Italy, the violent Gothic wars and the various other sieges throughout Italy further disregarded the already almost non-existent native Roman population, the already bad reputation of the Greeks for having abandoned the Romans worsened even more after the violent conflicts that took place. Roman citizens even reached conspiracy points against Belisarius and his troops, mostly Greek or Greek speaking. When Belisarius arrived in Italy, the Goths began to propagate anti-Greek sentiment, usually commenting that the only Greeks that were in Rome were mimes and thieves who did not contribute anything. The sentiment successfully spread due to the resentment already born between the Romans to the Greeks. At the climax of the tension and violence the Romans wrote a letter to the Emperor Justinian in which they proclaimed that they would rather be ruled by Goths than by Greeks, the Roman resentment against the Greeks was not limited only to the troops of Belisarius, but to all Hellenic influence in general.

Belisarius, noting the growing distrust of the Romans, wrote a letter to Emperor Justinian I over his concerns about the intentions of the Romans: &quot;And although at the present time the Romans are well disposed toward us, yet when their troubles are prolonged, they will probably not hesitate to choose the course which is better for their own interests. [...] Furthermore, the Romans will be compelled by hunger to do many things they would prefer not to do.&quot;

To reestablish order Justinian and Belisarius began to replace the native Roman popes and high functionaries who commonly conspired against the Byzantine troops in Rome or Italy, along with prestigious and powerful Roman nobles by Greek speakers from Syria, Antioch, Alexandria and Cilicia which he trusted more. This policy of &quot;Hellenization&quot; in the Italian peninsula and in the newly reconquered western provinces of the empire, each with a Byzantine exarch, was closely followed by Justinian and his successor&#x27;s.

The Ravenna exarchate and the following Catepanate of Italy, were responsible for the strong and continued Hellenic-Eastern influence on Italy to the point were most native if not all Roman traditions and customs had vanished due to the lack of a native Roman-Latin population, whose already almost non-existent cultural identity had to constantly face wars, famines and most importantly, their neighbors&#x27; Hellenic influence resulting in the decline of the previous Latin Roman culture.

The widespread destruction of Italy in the war, harsh Gothic and Byzantine reprisals of their opponents&#x27; supporters, and heavy Byzantine taxation led the Italian populace to shift allegiances: instead of loyalty to Empire, their identities were increasingly tied to religion, family and city instead.

However in the more prosperous east, their Byzantine counterparts were reflecting a kneading Hellenizing influence all over the Mediterranean. Reaching again their second biggest climax under Basil&#x27;s the second reign with Hellenic influence having deep effects in neighboring territories such as the Georgian, Armenian, Balkan and Italian provinces as well. They successfully reestablished their position and influence on former Hellenic territories such as Syria, Lebanon, much of Palestine and the surroundings areas.

<doc id="214980" wikidata="Q1368949" url="?curid=214980" title="Ancient Roman cuisine">
<text>The cuisine of ancient Rome changed greatly over the duration of the civilization&#x27;s existence. Dietary habits were affected by the political /changes from kingdom to republic to empire, and Roman trading with foreigners along with the empire&#x27;s enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new foods, provincial culinary habits and cooking methods.

In the beginning, dietary differences between Roman social classes were not great, but disparities developed with the empire&#x27;s growth.

==Archaeology==
Most organic foods decay under ordinary conditions, but ashes and animal bones offer some archaeological details about the ancient Roman diet. Phytoliths have been found at a cemetery in Tarragona, Spain. Imported figs were among the charred foods preserved when Boudica and her army burned down a Roman shop in Colchester. Chickpeas and bowls of fruit are known from Herculaneum, preserved since Vesuvius destroyed the town in 79 AD. Remains of small fish bones, sea urchin spines and mineralized plants have survived in the city&#x27;s sewers; the plants archaeologists have identified include dill, coriander, flax, lentil, cabbage, opium poppy and various other nuts, fruits and legumes, as well as a diverse variety of fish and shellfish. At Pompeii, grapes, cheese, bread and pastry were burned and buried in peristyle courtyard gardens as offerings to household &quot;Lares&quot;.

==Meals==

Traditionally, a breakfast called &quot;ientaculum&quot; was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate &quot;cena&quot;, the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called &quot;vesperna&quot;. With the increased importation of foreign foods, the &quot;cena&quot; grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the &quot;vesperna&quot; was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal &quot;prandium&quot; became a light meal to hold one over until &quot;cena&quot;. Among the lower classes of the Roman society, these changes were less pronounced as the traditional routines corresponded closely to the daily rhythms of manual labour.
However, among the upper classes, who normally did not engage in manual labour, it became customary to schedule all business obligations in the morning. After the &quot;prandium&quot;, the last responsibilities would be discharged, and a visit would be made to the baths. Around 2 p.m., the&quot; cena&quot; would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by &quot;comissatio&quot;, a round of alcoholic beverages (usually wine).

In the period of the kings and the early Republic, but also in later periods (for the working classes), the &quot;cena&quot; essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the &quot;puls&quot;. The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. A more sophisticated variation was made with olive oil, and consumed with an accompaniment of assorted vegetables when available. The wealthy commonly ate their &quot;puls&quot; with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish.

Over the course of the Republican period, the &quot;cena&quot; developed into two courses: the main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in three parts: an appetiser (&quot;gustatio&quot;), main course (&quot;primae mensae&quot;), and dessert (&quot;secundae mensae&quot;).

The Roman legions&#x27; staple ration of food was wheat. In the 4th century, most legionaries ate as well as anyone in Rome. They were supplied with rations of bread and vegetables along with meats such as beef, mutton, or pork. Rations also depended on where the legions were stationed or were campaigning. Mutton was popular in Northern Gaul and Britannia, but pork was the main meat ration of the legions.

==Foods and ingredients==
The Roman colonies provided many foods to Rome; the city received ham from Belgium, oysters from Brittany, garum from Mauretania, wild game from Tunisia, silphium (laser) from Cyrenaica, flowers from Egypt, lettuce from Cappadocia, and fish from Pontus.

The ancient Roman diet included many items that are staples of modern Italian cooking. Pliny the Elder discussed more than 30 varieties of olive, 40 kinds of pear, figs (native and imported from Africa and the eastern provinces), and a wide variety of vegetables. Some of these vegetables are no longer present in the modern world, while others have undergone significant changes. Carrots of different colours were consumed, but not in orange. Many kinds of vegetables were cultivated and consumed. These included celery, garlic, some flower bulbs, cabbage and other brassicas (such as kale and broccoli), lettuce, endive, onion, leek, asparagus, radishes, turnips, parsnips, carrots, beets, green peas, chard, field greens, cardoons, olives, and cucumber. Some vegetables were illustrated in reliefs. 

However, some foods considered characteristic of modern Italian cuisine were not used. In particular, spinach and eggplant (aubergine) were introduced later from the Arab world, and tomatoes, potatoes, capsicum peppers, maize (the modern source of polenta) and beans of the Phaseolus genus Phaseolus vulgaris (green - French and runner, lima, kidney) only appeared in Europe following the discovery of the New World and the Columbian Exchange. The Romans knew of rice, but it was very rarely available to them. There were also few citrus fruits. Lemons were known in Italy from the second century AD but were not widely cultivated. 

===Breads and grains===

From 123 BC, a ration of unmilled wheat (as much as 33 kg), known as the &quot;frumentatio&quot;, was distributed to as many as 200,000 people every month by the Roman state. There was originally a charge for this but from 58 BC this charge was abolished by the plebeian tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher. Individuals had to be citizens and domiciled in Rome to receive the &quot;frumentatio&quot;.

Originally flat, round loaves made of emmer (a cereal grain closely related to wheat) with a bit of salt were eaten; among the upper classes, eggs, cheese, and honey, along with milk and fruit were also consumed. In the Imperial period, around 1 AD, bread made of wheat was introduced; with time, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer loaves. There were many kinds of bread of differing quality. Typically white bread was baked for the elite, with darker bread baked for the middle class, and the darkest bread for the poor peasants. The bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives, cheese, and grapes. At the time of the destruction of Pompeii in AD 79, there were at least 33 bakeries in that city. Roman chefs made sweet buns flavored with blackcurrants and cheese cakes made with flour, honey, eggs, ricotta-like cheese and poppy seed. Sweet wine cakes were made with honey, reduced red wine and cinnamon. Fruit tarts were popular with the upper class, but the lower classes couldn&#x27;t afford to personally make them or purchase them from markets and vendors.

&quot;Juscellum&quot; was a broth with grated bread, eggs, sage and saffron, described in &quot;Apicius&quot;, a Roman recipe book of the late 4th or early 5th century.

===Meat===
Butcher&#x27;s meat was an uncommon luxury. The most popular meat was pork, especially sausages. Beef was uncommon in ancient Rome, being more common in ancient Greece – it is not mentioned by Juvenal or Horace. Seafood, game, and poultry, including ducks and geese, were more usual. For instance, on his triumph, Caesar gave a public feast to 260,000 humiliores (poorer people) which featured all three of these foods, but no butcher&#x27;s meat. John E. Stambaugh writes that meat &quot;was scarce except at sacrifices and the dinner parties of the rich&quot;. Cows were prized for their milk; bulls as plough and draft animals. Meat of working animals was tough and unappetizing. Veal was eaten occasionally. Apicius gives only four recipes for beef but the same recipes call for lamb or pork as options. There is only one recipe for beef stew and another for veal scallopini.

Dormice were eaten and considered a delicacy. It was a status symbol among wealthy Romans, and some even had dormice weighed in front of dinner guests. A sumptuary law enacted under Marcus Aemilius Scaurus forbade the eating of dormice, but failed to stop the practice.

===Fish and seafood===
Fish was more common than meat. Aquaculture was sophisticated, with large-scale industries devoted to oyster farming. The Romans also engaged in snail farming and oak grub farming. Some fish were greatly esteemed and fetched high prices, such as mullet raised in the fishery at Cosa, and &quot;elaborate means were invented to assure its freshness&quot;.

===Fruit===
Fruit was eaten fresh when in season, and dried or preserved over winter. Popular fruits included apples, pears, figs, grapes, quinces, citron, strawberries, blackberries, elderberries, currants, damson plums, dates, melons, rose hips and pomegranates. Less common fruits were the more exotic azeroles and medlars. Cherries and apricots, both introduced in the 1st century BC, were popular. Peaches were introduced in the 1st century AD from Persia. Oranges and lemons were known but used more for medicinal purposes than in cookery. Although known to the ancient Romans, lemons were not cultivated in Italy until the Principate. At least 35 cultivars of pear were grown in Rome, along with three types of apples. Cato described pear culture methods similar to modern techniques. There are recipes for pear and peach creams and milk puddings flavored with honey, pepper and a little garum.

Columella offers advice on the preservation of figs by crushing them into a paste with anise, fennel seed, cumin and toasted sesame to be wrapped in fig leaves.

===Vegetables===
While the precursors of Brussels sprouts, artichokes, peas, rutabaga, and possibly cauliflower probably existed in Roman times, the modern cultivated forms we think of were not developed until the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance times. Cabbage was eaten both raw (sometimes dipped in vinegar) and cooked. Cato greatly esteemed cabbage, believing it to be good for the digestion, and also believed that if a sick person ate a great deal of cabbage and bathed in his own urine, he would recover.

===Legumes===
Legumes were limited to dried peas, fava beans (broad beans), chickpeas, lentils, and lupins. The Romans knew several varieties of chickpea, such as venus, ram, and punic. They were either cooked down into a broth or roasted as a snack. The Roman cookbook &quot;Apicius&quot; gives several recipes for chickpeas.

===Nuts===
The ancient Romans ate walnuts, almonds, pistachios, chestnuts, hazelnuts (filberts), pine nuts, and sesame seeds, which they sometimes pulverized to thicken spiced, sweet wine sauces for roast meat and fowl to serve on the side or over the meat as a glaze. Nuts were also used in savoury pesto-like sauces for cold cuts. Nuts were used in pastries, tarts and puddings sweetened with honey.

===Dairy===
Cheese was eaten and its manufacture was well-established by the Roman Empire period. It was part of the standard rations for Roman soldiers and was popular among civilians as well. The Emperor Diocletian (284–305 CE) fixed maximum prices for cheese. The manufacture of cheese and its quality and culinary uses are mentioned by a number of Roman authors: Pliny the Elder described cheese&#x27;s dietary and medicinal uses in Book 28 of &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;, and Varro in &quot;De Agricultura&quot; described the Roman cheesemaking season (spring and summer) and compared soft, new cheeses with drier, aged cheeses. The most extensive description of Roman cheese-making comes from Columella, from his treatise on Roman agriculture, &quot;De Re Rustica&quot;.

===Condiments===
Garum was the distinctive fish sauce of ancient Rome. It was used as a seasoning, in place of salt; as a table condiment; and as a sauce. There were four major fish sauce types: &quot;garum&quot;, &quot;liquamen&quot;, &quot;muria&quot;, and &quot;allec&quot;. It was made in different qualities, from fish such as tuna, mullet, and sea bass. It could be flavored, for example mixed with wine, or diluted with water (&quot;hydrogarum&quot;), a form popular among Roman soldiers, although the emperor Elagabalus asserted that he was the first to serve it at public banquets in Rome. The most costly garum was &quot;garum sociorum&quot;, made from mackerel (&quot;scomber&quot;) at the New Carthage fisheries in Spain, and widely traded. Pliny wrote in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that two congii (7 litres) of this sauce cost 1,000 sesterces. One thousand sesterces in the Early Empire was equal to 110 g of gold.

==Cooking==

One of many modes of cooking in ancient Rome was the &quot;focus&quot;, a hearth that was placed in front of the lararium, the household altar which contained small sculptures of the household deity (the &quot;lares&quot;, or guardian ancestor-spirits, and the &quot;penates&quot;, who were believed to protect the &quot;floor&quot;, the larder). In homes where the &quot;lararium&quot; was built into the wall, the &quot;focus&quot; was sometimes built of raised brick into four sides, constructed against a baseboard on which a fire was lit. More common was a &quot;focus&quot; that was rectangular and portable, consisting simply of a moveable hearth with stone or bronze feet. After the development of separate kitchens, the &quot;focus&quot; began to be used only for religious offerings and for warmth, rather than for cooking.

Portable stoves and ovens were used by the Romans, and some had water pots and grills laid onto them. At Pompeii, most houses had separate kitchens, most fairly small, but a few large; the Villa of the Mysteries covers a nine-by-twelve meter area. A number of kitchens at Pompeii had no roofs, resembling courtyards more than ordinary rooms; this allowed smoke to ventilate. Kitchens that did have roofs must have been extremely smokey, since the only ventilation would come from high windows or holes in the ceiling; while the Romans built chimneys for their bakeries and smithies, they were unknown in private dwellings until about the 12th century A.D, well after the collapse of Roman civilization.

Many Roman kitchens had an oven (&quot;furnus&quot; or &quot;fornax&quot;), and some (such as the kitchen of the Villa of the Mysteries) had two. A square or dome-shaped construction of brick or stone, these ovens had a flat floor, often of granite and sometimes lava, which were filled with dry twigs and then lit. On the walls of kitchens were hooks and chains for hanging cooking equipment, including various pots and pans, knives, meat forks, sieves, graters, spits, tongs, cheese-slicers, nutcrackers, jugs for measuring, and pâté moulds.

==Alcoholic drinks==

In Ancient Rome, wine was normally mixed with water immediately before drinking, since the fermentation was not controlled and the alcohol concentration was high. Wine was sometimes adjusted and &quot;improved&quot; by its makers: instructions survive for making white wine from red and vice versa, as well as for rescuing wine that is turning to vinegar. Those instructions as well as detailed descriptions of Roman viticulture date back to 160 BC in the oldest surviving text written in Latin prose.

Wine was also variously flavored. For example, there was &quot;passum&quot;, a strong and sweet raisin wine, for which the earliest known recipe is of Carthaginian origin; &quot;mulsum&quot;, a freshly made mixture of wine and honey (called a pyment today); and &quot;conditum&quot;, a mixture of wine, honey and spices made in advance and matured. One specific recipe, Conditum Paradoxum, is for a mixture of wine, honey, pepper, laurel, dates, mastic, and saffron, cooked and stored for later use. Another recipe called for the addition of seawater, pitch and rosin to the wine. A Greek traveler reported that the beverage was apparently an acquired taste. Sour wine mixed with water and herbs (&quot;posca&quot;) was a popular drink for the lower classes and a staple part of the Roman soldier&#x27;s ration.

Beer (&quot;cerevisia&quot;) was known but considered vulgar, and was associated with barbarians.

== Desserts ==
While lacking necessary ingredients commonly used in the modern era for sweets such as refined sugar or properly churned butter, ancient Rome had desserts to serve after they had completed their meals served with wine. The most renowned were large platters of various fruits picked fresh; some of the more exotic fruits that were not able to grow in Rome were even shipped in from distant continents for the wealthy. Due to the lack of a sweetener such as sugar there was always a desire for the sweetest fruits that were available. Spira was a type of sweet pastry that was readily available during this time, made with a thin, cake-like crust sometimes containing fruit. Enkythoi is another common type of Roman pastry that was softer, like a modern sponge cake.

<text>Macropodidae is a family of marsupials that includes kangaroos, wallabies, tree-kangaroos, wallaroos, pademelons, quokkas, and several other groups. These genera are allied to the suborder Macropodiformes, containing other macropods, and are native to the Australian continent (the mainland and Tasmania), New Guinea and nearby islands.

==Description==

Although omnivorous kangaroos lived in the past, these were not members of the family Macropodidae; modern macropods are generally herbivorous. Some are browsers, but most are grazers and are equipped with appropriately specialised teeth for cropping and grinding up fibrous plants, in particular grasses and sedges. Modern omnivorous kangaroos generally belong to a different family (for example, the Musky rat-kangaroo). In general, macropods have a broad, straight row of cutting teeth at the front of the mouth, no canine teeth, and a gap before the molars. The molars are large and, unusually, do not appear all at once but a pair at a time at the back of the mouth as the animal ages, eventually becoming worn down by the tough, abrasive grasses and falling out. Like many Macropodiformes, early kangaroos had plagiaulacoids, but these converted into normal molars in more derived species. Most species have four molars and, when the last pair is too worn to be of use, the animals starve to death. The dental formula for macropods is .

Like the eutherian ruminants of the Northern Hemisphere (sheep, cattle, and so on), macropods have specialised digestive systems that use a high concentration of bacteria, protozoans, and fungi in the first chamber of a complex stomach to digest plant material. The details of organisation are quite different, but the result is somewhat similar.

The particular structure-function relationship of the Macropodidae gut and the gut microbiota allows the degradation of lignocellulosic material with a relatively low emission of methane relative to other ruminants. These low emissions are partly explained by the anatomical differences between the macropodid digestive system and that of ruminants, resulting in shorter retention times of particulate digesta within the foregut. This fact might prevent the establishment of methanogenic archaea, which has been found in low levels in tammar wallabies (&quot;Notamacropus eugenii&quot;) and eastern grey kangaroo (&quot;M. giganteus&quot;). Metagenomic analysis revealed that the foregut of tammar wallabies mainly contains bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Pseudomonadota. Among Pseudomonadota populations of the Succinivibrionaceae family are overrepresented and may contribute to low methane emissions.

Macropods vary in size considerably, but most have very large hind legs and long, powerfully muscled tails. The term &quot;macropod&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;large foot&quot; and is appropriate: most have very long, narrow hind feet with a distinctive arrangement of toes. The fourth toe is very large and strong, the fifth toe moderately so; the second and third are fused; and the first toe is usually missing. Their short front legs have five separate digits. Some macropods have seven carpal bones instead of the usual eight in mammals. All have relatively small heads and most have large ears, except for tree-kangaroos, which must move quickly between closely spaced branches. The young are born very small and the pouch opens forward.

The unusual development of the hind legs is optimised for economical long-distance travel at fairly high speed. The greatly elongated feet provide enormous leverage for the strong legs, but the famous kangaroo hop has more: kangaroos and wallabies have a unique ability to store elastic strain energy in their tendons. In consequence, most of the energy required for each hop is provided &quot;free&quot; by the spring action of the tendons (rather than by muscular effort). The main limitation on a macropod&#x27;s ability to leap is not the strength of the muscles in the hindquarters, it is the ability of the joints and tendons to withstand the strain of hopping.

Furthermore, the act of hopping in kangaroos and wallabies is associated with their breathing process. The movement of their feet off the ground helps to expel air from their lungs, while bringing their feet forward for landing replenishes their lungs with air, resulting in greater energy efficiency. Studies conducted on these animals have shown that hopping at faster speeds requires only a minimal increase in effort beyond the energy required to hop in general, which is significantly less than what would be required in other animals like horses, dogs, or humans. Additionally, it has been observed that carrying extra weight requires little additional energy, which is particularly important for female kangaroos and wallabies carrying heavy pouch young.

The ability of larger macropods to survive on poor-quality, low-energy feed, and to travel long distances at high speed without great energy expenditure (to reach fresh food supplies or waterholes, and to escape predators) has been crucial to their evolutionary success on a continent that, because of poor soil fertility and low, unpredictable average rainfall, offers only very limited primary plant productivity.

Most macropod species have a polygynous mating system and produce a mating plug after copulation. Gestation in macropods lasts about a month, being slightly longer in the largest species. Typically, only a single young is born, weighing less than at birth. They soon attach themselves to one of four teats inside the mother&#x27;s pouch. The young leave the pouch after five to 11 months, and are weaned after a further two to six months. Macropods reach sexual maturity at one to three years of age, depending on the species.

==Fossil record==

The evolutionary ancestors of marsupials split from placental mammals during the Jurassic period about 160 million years ago (Mya). The earliest known fossil macropod dates back about 11.61 to 28.4 Mya, either in the Miocene or Late Oligocene, and was uncovered in South Australia. Unfortunately, the fossil could not be identified any further than the family. A Queensland fossil of a species similar to &quot;Hadronomas&quot; has been dated at around 5.33 to 11.61 Mya, falling in the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. The earliest completely identifiable fossils are from around 5.33 Mya.

==Classification==


The listing for extant species is based on The Third edition of Wilson &amp; Reeder&#x27;s Mammal Species of the World (2005), except where the Mammal Diversity Database and IUCN agree on a change. The two living subfamilies in the family Macropodidae are the Lagostrophinae, represented by a single species, the banded hare-wallaby, and the remainder, which make up the subfamily Macropodinae (67 species).

<text>Stanley Clarke (born June 30, 1951) is an American bassist, composer and founding member of Return to Forever, one of the first jazz fusion bands. Clarke gave the bass guitar a prominence it lacked in jazz-related music. He is the first jazz-fusion bassist to headline tours, sell out shows worldwide and have recordings reach gold status.

Clarke is the recipient of five Grammy Awards, with 15 nominations, three as a solo artist, one with the Stanley Clarke Band, and one with Return to Forever. Clarke was selected to become a 2022 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship.

A Stanley Clarke electric bass is permanently on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.

==Music career==
===Early years===

Clarke was born on June 30, 1951, in Philadelphia. His mother sang opera around the house, belonged to a church choir, and encouraged him to study music. He started on accordion, then tried violin. But he felt awkward holding such a small instrument in his big hands when he was twelve years old and over six feet tall. No one wanted the acoustic bass in the corner, so he picked it up. He took lessons on the double bass at the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, studying classical bass for five years under Eligio Rossi. He picked up bass guitar in his teens so that he could perform at parties and imitate the rock and pop bands that girls liked.

Clarke attended the Philadelphia Musical Academy (later known as the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, and ultimately as the University of the Arts, after having merged with the Philadelphia College of Art) and after graduating moved to New York City in 1971. His recording debut was with Curtis Fuller. He worked with Joe Henderson and Pharoah Sanders, then in 1972 with Tony Williams Lifetime Experience, Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon, and Art Blakey, followed by Gil Evans, Mel Lewis, and Horace Silver.

===Return to Forever (band)===
Clarke intended to become the first black musician in the Philadelphia Orchestra until he met jazz pianist Chick Corea. At the time, Corea was working with Stan Getz putting together a new backing band for him and writing music for the group; these pieces first surfaced on two albums recorded in February/March 1972 in New York, &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (credited to Getz, released in 1974) and &quot;Return to Forever&quot; (credited to Corea, issued in Europe in 1972). Clarke&#x27;s playing and improvising was prominent on both albums; the band also played a couple of gigs with Getz in Europe. At this early stage, the band as separate from Getz was mostly a studio side project, but the members soon realized that it had potential as a regular live band, and so the band Return to Forever had been born.

The first edition of Return to Forever performed primarily Latin-oriented music and used only acoustic instruments (except for Corea&#x27;s Fender Rhodes piano). This band consisted of singer Flora Purim, her husband Airto Moreira (both Brazilians) on drums and percussion, Corea&#x27;s longtime musical co-worker Joe Farrell on saxophone and flute, and Clarke on bass. Their first album, titled &quot;Return to Forever&quot;, was recorded for ECM Records in 1972. The second album, &quot;Light as a Feather&quot; (1973), was released by Polydor and included the song &quot;Spain&quot;.

After the second album, Farrell, Purim and Moreira left the group to form their own band, and guitarist Bill Connors, drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Mingo Lewis were added. Lenny White (who had played with Corea in Miles Davis&#x27;s band) replaced Gadd and Lewis on drums and percussion, and the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy&quot; (1973), was released.

Fusion was a combination of rock and jazz which they helped develop in the early 1970s. Clarke was playing a new kind of music, using new techniques, and giving the bass guitar a prominence it lacked. He drew attention to the bass guitar as a solo instrument that could be melodic and dominant in addition to being part of the rhythm section. For helping to bring the bass guitar to the front of the band, Clarke cites Jaco Pastorius, Paul McCartney, Jack Bruce, and Larry Graham.

After Return to Forever&#x27;s second album, &quot;Light as a Feather&quot;, Clarke received job offers from Bill Evans, Miles Davis, and Ray Manzarek of the Doors, but he remained with Return to Forever until 1977. During the early 1980s, he toured with Corea and Return to Forever, then worked with Bobby Lyle, Eliane Elias, David Benoit and Michel Petrucciani. He toured in a band with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter in 1991. In 1998 he founded Superband with Lenny White, Larry Carlton, and Jeff Lorber.

===Solo===
Corea produced Clarke&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Children of Forever&quot; (1973), and played keyboards on it with guitarist Pat Martino, drummer Lenny White, flautist Art Webb, and vocalists Andy Bey and Dee Dee Bridgewater. Clarke played double bass and bass guitar.

Clarke&#x27;s second self-titled album &quot;Stanley Clarke&quot; (1974) featured Tony Williams on drums, Bill Connors on electric and acoustic guitar, and Jan Hammer on synthesizer [Moog], electric piano, organ, and piano [acoustic].

While on tour, British guitarist Jeff Beck was performing the song &quot;Power&quot; from that album, and this was the impetus for their meeting and Beck&#x27;s introduction to Hammer. They toured together, and Beck appeared on some of Clarke&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Journey to Love&quot; (1975) and &quot;Modern Man&quot; (1978).

The album &quot;School Days&quot; (Epic, 1976) brought Clarke the most attention and praise he had received so far. With its memorable riff, the title song became so revered that fans called out for it during concerts.

===Rock and funk===
Clarke has spent much of his career outside jazz. In 1979, Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones formed the New Barbarians with Clarke and Keith Richards. Two years later, Clarke and keyboardist George Duke formed the Clarke/Duke Project, which combined pop, jazz, funk, and R&amp;B. They met in 1971 in Finland when Duke was with Cannonball Adderley. They recorded together for the first time on Clarke&#x27;s album &quot;Journey to Love&quot;. Their first album contained the single &quot;Sweet Baby&quot;, which became a top 20 pop hit. They reunited for tours during the 1990s and the 2000s.

Clarke joined fellow bassist Paul McCartney in 1981 to play bass on McCartney&#x27;s 1982 &amp; 1983 releases &quot;Tug of War&quot; and &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;.

===The Stanley Clarke Band===

The Stanley Clarke Band is an American jazz band led by Clarke. He founded the band in 1985, with Ruslan Sirota, Shariq Tucker, Cameron Graves, Beka Gochiashvili, Salar Nader, and Evan Garr. They released the album &quot;Find Out!&quot;. With a new group, The Stanley Clarke Band released the album &quot;The Stanley Clarke Band&quot; which won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. Their album &quot;The Message&quot; was released in 2018.

==== Career ====
The band&#x27;s first album &quot;Find Out!&quot; was recorded at Sunset Sound Studios and was released in 1985 by Sony. With a band composed of Stanley Clarke on bass, Ronald Bruner Jr. on drums, and Ruslan Sirota on keyboards, the Stanley Clarke Band released &quot;The Stanley Clarke Band&quot; album. It was produced by Lenny White and Stanley Clarke and featured pianist Hiromi.&quot;

The album &quot;The Stanley Clarke Band&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards. Additionally, the track &quot;No Mystery&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

The Stanley Clarke Band with Clarke, Bruner Jr., and Sirota released &quot;The Message&quot;.

==Other groups==
In 1988, Clarke and drummer Stewart Copeland of the rock band the Police formed Animal Logic with singer-songwriter Deborah Holland. He and Copeland were friends before the Police formed. Copeland appeared on Clarke&#x27;s album &quot;Up&quot; (Mack Avenue, 2014).

In 2014 Clarke was invited on stage with Primus during their &quot;Primus and the Chocolate Factory&quot; tour featuring other guest appearances from Stewart Copeland and Danny Carey of Tool to perform the Primus classic &quot;Here Come the Bastards&quot; with Clarke and Les Claypool having a shred bass duel midway.

In 2020 Clarke was invited as a teacher at a Bass Bootcamp hosted by bassist Gerald Veasley. The camp was hosted in Philadelphia where bassists of all ages were taught and featured many educators and professionals such as Richard Waller, Rob Smith, Freekbass, Michael Manring, and more. Unfortunately the camp was delayed and moved to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Other jazz groups===
In 2005, Clarke toured as Trio! with Béla Fleck and Jean-Luc Ponty. Clarke and Ponty had worked in a trio with guitarist Al Di Meola in 1995 and recorded the album &quot;The Rite of Strings&quot;. They worked in a trio again in 2012 with guitarist Biréli Lagrène and two years later recorded &quot;D-Stringz&quot; (Impulse!, 2015).

In 2008, Clarke formed SMV with bassists Marcus Miller and Victor Wooten and recorded the album &quot;Thunder&quot;.

In 2009 he released &quot;Jazz in the Garden&quot;, featuring the Stanley Clarke Trio with pianist Hiromi Uehara and drummer Lenny White. The following year he released the &quot;Stanley Clarke Band&quot;, with Ruslan Sirota on keyboards and Ronald Bruner, Jr. on drums; the album also features Hiromi on piano.

His album &quot;Up&quot;, released in 2014, has enlisted an all-star cast in his musical ensemble, including former Return to Forever bandmate Chick Corea on piano, with drummer Stewart Copeland (The Police) and guitarist Jimmy Herring (Widespread Panic), among others.

In 2018, Clarke released &quot;The Message&quot;, featuring the new Stanley Clarke Band with Cameron Graves on synthesizers, pianist Beka Gochiashvili, and drummer Mike Mitchell. The album also features rapper/beatboxer Doug E. Fresh and trumpeter Mark Isham.

In 2019, The Stanley Clarke Band has transformed again as Clarke, Cameron Graves, and Beka Gochiashvili were joined by Shariq Tucker on drums, Salar Nader on tabla, and Evan Garr on violin.

===Television and movies===
Clarke has written scores for television and movies. His first score, for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, was nominated for an Emmy Award. He also composed music for the movies &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, &quot;Passenger 57&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;, the television programs &quot;Lincoln Heights&quot;, &quot;Waynehead&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot; and &quot;Soul Food&quot;, and the video for &quot;Remember the Time&quot; by Michael Jackson.

In 2007, Clarke released the DVD &quot;Night School: An Evening of Stanley Clarke and Friends&quot;, a concert that was recorded in 2002 at the Musicians&#x27; Institute in Hollywood. Clarke plays both acoustic and electric bass and is joined by guests Stewart Copeland, Lenny White, Béla Fleck, Shelia E., and Patrice Rushen.

Clarke&#x27;s TV and movie music contribution can be found in &quot;Soul Food&quot; (2000–2004), &quot;Static Shock&quot; (2000–2004), &quot;First Sunday&quot; (2008), &quot;Soul Men&quot; (2008), &quot;The Best Man Holiday&quot; (2013), and &quot;Barbershop: The Next Cut&quot; (2016).

His latest score composition work was for the documentary film &quot;Halston&quot; (2019), directed by Frédéric Tcheng. The film tells the extraordinary story of the life and death of the American fashion designer, Roy Halston Frowick.

==Record label==
In 2010, Clarke founded Roxboro Entertainment Group in Topanga, California. He named it after the high school that he attended in the 1960s. The label&#x27;s first releases were by guitarist Lloyd Gregory and composer Kennard Ramsey. Roxboro&#x27;s roster also includes keyboardist Sunnie Paxson, pianist Ruslan Sirota, and pianist Beka Gochiashvili.

==Electric bass technique==
When playing electric bass, Clarke places his right hand so that his fingers approach the strings much as they would on an upright bass, but rotated through 90 degrees. To achieve this, his forearm lies above and nearly parallel to the strings, while his wrist is hooked downward at nearly a right angle. For lead and solo playing, his fingers partially hook underneath the strings so that when released, the strings snap against the frets, producing a biting percussive attack. In addition to an economical variation on the funky Larry Graham-style slap-n&#x27;-pop technique, Clarke also uses downward thrusts of the entire right hand, striking two or more strings from above with his fingernails (examples of this technique include &quot;School Days&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Jelly&quot;, &quot;Wild Dog&quot;, and &quot;Danger Street&quot;). Clarke has been playing Alembic short scale basses since 1973. Alembic also manufactures a series Stanley Clarke Signature Bass models.

==Awards and honors==

=== Latin Grammy Awards ===
Clarke received the Latin Grammy for Best Instrumental Album in 2011 at the 12th Annual Latin Grammy Awards for the album &quot;Forever&quot;, along with Chick Corea and Lenny White.

<text>Robbie Rebel was a British celebrity comics gag-a-day comic strip, which premiered in &quot;The Beano&quot; comic in issue 3104, dated 12 January 2002. Based extensively on Robbie Williams, who at that time was very popular, his creators aimed to make him the Dennis the Menace of the 21st Century: his adventures are set in a contemporary world of mobile phones, computers and music videos.

==Concept==

His first appearance showed him being born &#x27;seven years ago&#x27;, and being smacked on the bottom by the nurse to start his breathing. Instead of crying, he giggles. This sets the tone of the strip: Robbie is a rebel who does nothing he is told (although he occasionally does as he&#x27;s told if he can make a job hard for his parents or anyone else, for instance scrapping a whole kitchen for a compost heap, when his dad told him to find scraps in the kitchen for the heap). His appearance was a breath of fresh air to &quot;The Beano&quot;: he sported long jeans, school shoes and a T-shirt, usually with an animal motif on it giving the wrong sound for the animal (so the silhouette of a Duck going &#x27;moo&#x27; etc.) and has &quot;No way&quot; written on the back of all of them. A second strip in the same issue as his debut introduced his dog, Defido, who, like his Master, is a rebel. Robbie&#x27;s parents are shown to be relatively young and trendy, particularly his pretty blonde mother.

Robbie has had two girls going after him, both competing to make him their boyfriend. They are called Kylie Geriwall and Geri Minogue (a mix-up from the singers Geri Halliwell and Kylie Minogue) and Kylie won (eventually, seeing as he always rejected them). In the later reprints, Geri was renamed Cheryl. More recent strips saw Kylie become a rival to Robbie, and they no longer seemed to be in a relationship.
It is one of the few instances where a Beano character seemed to fancy a girl. Other examples include Fred in Tom Paterson&#x27;s Fred&#x27;s Bed who fancies Hannah Montana.

Robbie is drawn by &quot;Desperate Dan&quot; artist Ken H. Harrison, and his clean drawing style immediately cemented the strips&#x27;popularity. Because of Ken&#x27;s continuing work on Desperate Dan, Robbie did not initially appear as regularly as other characters such as Roger the Dodger or Billy Whizz. With Desperate Dan&#x27;s revamp when the Dandy got a facelift in September 2004, both were drawn in the same style (as opposed to the &#x27;old&#x27; Desperate Dan where Ken drew things more detailed). Following the decision to stop running new Desperate Dan strips in mid-2007, Harrison was able to concentrate entirely on Robbie, who was now able to appear on a weekly basis.

In the Beano Christmas special 2007, Robbie Rebel had a joint strip with The Riot Squad.

In February 2008, Robbie Rebel left The Beano after 6 years. It has been hinted that Robbie had a terrible accident when he crashed into a tree in his last comic appearance. The strip ended so that Harrison could take over Minnie the Minx. However, in the 25 September 2010 issue, there has been a reprint of the strip. Then, since the issue dated 13 November 2010, he started to appear regularly as a reprint for several months.

<text>Cats is a sung-through musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is based on the 1939 poetry collection &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; by T. S. Eliot. The musical tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the &quot;Jellicle choice&quot; by deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. As of 2024, &quot;Cats&quot; remains the fifth-longest-running Broadway show and the eighth-longest-running West End show.

Lloyd Webber began setting Eliot&#x27;s poems to music in 1977, and the compositions were first presented as a song cycle in 1980. Producer Cameron Mackintosh then recruited director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne to turn the songs into a complete musical. &quot;Cats&quot; opened to positive reviews at the New London Theatre in the West End in 1981 and then to mixed reviews at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in 1982. It won numerous awards including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier and Tony Awards. Despite its unusual premise that deterred investors initially, the musical turned out to be an unprecedented commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$3.5 billion by 2012.

The London production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances, making &quot;Cats&quot; the longest-running musical in both theatre districts for a number of years. &quot;Cats&quot; has since been revived in the West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world many times. Long-running foreign productions include a 15-year run at the Operettenhaus in Hamburg that played over 6,100 performances, as well as an ongoing run in a purpose-built theatre in Japan that has played over 10,000 performances since it opened in 1983.

&quot;Cats&quot; started the megamusical phenomenon, establishing a global market for musical theatre and directing the industry&#x27;s focus to big-budget blockbusters, as well as family- and tourist-friendly shows. The musical&#x27;s profound but polarising influence also reshaped the aesthetic, technology, and marketing of the medium. &quot;Cats&quot; was adapted into a direct-to-video film in 1998 and a feature film in 2019.
==Background==
&quot;Cats&quot; is based on T. S. Eliot&#x27;s 1939 poetry book &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;, and the songs in the musical consist of Eliot&#x27;s verse set to music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The musical is unusual in its construction; along with Eliot&#x27;s poems, music and dance are the main focus of the show at the expense of a traditional narrative structure. Musicologists William Everett and Paul Laird described &quot;Cats&quot; as &quot;combining elements of the revue and concept musical&quot;. The plot centres on a tribe of cats called the Jellicles, as they come together at the annual Jellicle Ball to decide which one of them will ascend to the Heaviside Layer (their version of heaven) and be reborn into a new life. The bulk of the musical consists of the different contenders being introduced, either by themselves or by other cats.

===Poems===

&quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; is a collection of light poetry about cats that Eliot had originally written for his godchildren in the 1930s. Due to the rhythmic nature of Eliot&#x27;s work, there had been previous attempts before &quot;Cats&quot; at setting his poems to music, though none of these attempts had been met with much critical or commercial success. John Snelson, a musicologist, wrote of the poems:

Most of the lyrics in &quot;Cats&quot; were taken from &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; with very minor alterations. Supplementary verses from unpublished poems by Eliot were adapted for &quot;Grizabella: The Glamour Cat&quot; and &quot;The Journey to the Heaviside Layer&quot;, while the song &quot;The Moments of Happiness&quot; was taken from a passage in Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Dry Salvages&quot;. &quot;Cats&quot; director Trevor Nunn and lyricist Richard Stilgoe provided the remaining lyrics, namely for the opening number &quot;Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats&quot; and the most famous song from the musical: &quot;Memory&quot;. The former was written by Nunn and Stilgoe and was modelled after an unpublished poem by Eliot titled &quot;Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats&quot;, while the latter was written by Nunn based on another Eliot poem titled &quot;Rhapsody on a Windy Night&quot;.

==Creation==
===Inception===
Lloyd Webber began composing the songs in late 1977 as a songwriting exercise, partly because Eliot&#x27;s book had been a childhood favourite and partly to see if he could write music to predetermined lyrics. The compositions were performed privately for friends but Lloyd Webber had no further intentions for them at the time. After his song cycle &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; was televised by the BBC in early 1980, Lloyd Webber began to consider using his musicalization of Eliot&#x27;s poems in the same vein for a televised concert anthology. He approached producer Cameron Mackintosh to explore possible avenues for the songs.

&quot;Practical Cats&quot;, as the show was then called, was first presented as a song cycle at the 1980 summer Sydmonton Festival. The concert was performed by Gemma Craven, Gary Bond and Paul Nicholas. Eliot&#x27;s widow and literary executor, Valerie, was in attendance and brought along various unpublished cat-themed poems by Eliot. One of these was &quot;Grizabella the Glamour Cat&quot; which, although rejected from Eliot&#x27;s book for being &quot;too sad for children&quot;, gave Lloyd Webber the idea for a full-blown musical. He explained:

Lloyd Webber thus decided to turn &quot;Practical Cats&quot; into a musical, co-produced by Mackintosh and the Really Useful Group&#x27;s Brian Brolly.

===Development===
Shortly after the Sydmonton Festival, Lloyd Webber began setting the unpublished poems he had been given to music, a few of which were later added into the show. He also composed the overture and &quot;The Jellicle Ball&quot;, incorporating analog synthesizers into these orchestrations to try to create a unique electronic soundscape. Meanwhile, Mackintosh recruited Nunn, the then artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), to direct &quot;Practical Cats&quot;. Nunn was an unusual choice as he was considered &quot;too high-brow&quot; for musical theatre, but Mackintosh felt that a &quot;pedigree&quot; director was needed to ensure Valerie Eliot&#x27;s approval of the project. After much persuasion, Nunn came on board and was joined by his RSC colleagues, choreographer Gillian Lynne and set and costume designer John Napier. Nunn initially envisioned &quot;Practical Cats&quot; as a chamber piece for five actors and two pianos, which he felt would reflect &quot;Eliot&#x27;s charming, slightly offbeat, mildly satiric view of late-1930s London&quot;. However, he relented to Lloyd Webber&#x27;s more ambitious vision for the musical. Nunn was also convinced that for the musical to have the wide commercial appeal that the producers desired, it could not remain as a series of isolated numbers but instead had to have a narrative through line. He was therefore tasked with piecing the self-contained poems together into a story. Nunn wrote about the significance &quot;Grizabella the Glamour Cat&quot; had on the construction of the narrative:

An event called the Jellicle Ball was referenced by Eliot in the poem &quot;The Song of the Jellicles&quot;, while a cat version of heaven known as the Heaviside Layer was mentioned in one of his unpublished poems. Nunn expanded on these concepts by conceiving the Jellicle Ball as an annual ritual in which the cats vie to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer, thus giving the characters a reason to gather and sing about themselves in the musical. He also added the element of rebirth as a play on the idea that cats have nine lives.

One of Nunn&#x27;s stipulations for agreeing to direct &quot;Practical Cats&quot; was that actress Judi Dench would be cast in the musical. Lloyd Webber was happy to oblige given her credentials and so Dench joined the company in the dual roles of Grizabella and Jennyanydots. Former Royal Ballet principal dancer Wayne Sleep was offered the part of Mr. Mistoffelees after Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh attended a performance by his dance troupe, one of the many dance showcases they saw in preparation for the musical. Casting for the other roles began in November 1980, with auditions held across the UK for dancers who could also sing and act. There was an initial disagreement over the casting of Paul Nicholas as Rum Tum Tugger; Nunn had misgivings about the actor&#x27;s easy-going attitude but eventually yielded to Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Lynne, all of whom were keen on Nicholas for the role. Sarah Brightman, who had already made a name for herself with the chart hit &quot;I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper&quot;, arranged a private audition and was cast in an as-then undecided role. By December, the full cast had been assembled.

Meanwhile, Mackintosh engaged the advertising agency Dewynters to design a poster for the musical. After much back-and-forth, the agency presented a minimalist poster consisting of a pair of yellow feline eyes (with dancing silhouettes for the pupils) set against a black backdrop. The producers and the creative team loved the design but felt that the title — &quot;Practical Cats&quot; — looked out of place when paired with the image of the cat&#x27;s eyes. The musical&#x27;s title was thus shortened to just &quot;Cats&quot;.

The musical was scheduled to open on 30 April 1981, with previews starting on 22 April. Shortly before tickets went on sale in mid-February, Nunn revealed to the alarmed producers that he was struggling to write the script for the musical. Despite still having no established book or score, rehearsals began on 9 March 1981 in a church hall in Chiswick, London. The situation improved later that day when Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Nunn met with Richard Stilgoe, a musician known for his ability to improvise lyrics on the spot, in hopes that Stilgoe could write an opening song for the musical. By the next evening, Stilgoe had produced a draft for &quot;Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats&quot;. However, &quot;Memory&quot;, an 11 o&#x27;clock number for Grizabella that Nunn insisted the show needed as its &quot;emotional centre&quot;, still had no lyrics at this point. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s former writing partner Tim Rice was brought in to write a lyric for the song, but his version was rejected by Nunn for being too depressing. The lyrics for &quot;Memory&quot; were not completed by Nunn until well into the previews.

Many of the ensemble characters were created by the original cast through extensive improvisation sessions held during the rehearsal process. Said Nunn: &quot;[O]n day one of rehearsals what we had was 15 poems set to music and five weeks later we had a show with characters, relationships and stories running from beginning to end.&quot; The production faced a last minute mishap when Dench snapped her Achilles tendon during rehearsals for &quot;The Old Gumbie Cat&quot; and had to pull out one week before the first preview. Shortly after this, the original music director, Chris Walker, also had to leave the production for medical reasons and was replaced by the film conductor Harry Rabinowitz. Dench&#x27;s understudy Myra Sands replaced her as Jennyanydots, while Elaine Paige agreed to take over the role of Grizabella. Opening night was pushed back to 11 May, but Mackintosh refused to postpone the previews as he wanted to dispel the industry rumours that the production was an impending debacle.

The development of &quot;Cats&quot; was also plagued by financial troubles. Mackintosh struggled to raise the £450,000 (US$1.16 million) needed to stage the musical in the West End as major investors were sceptical of the show&#x27;s premise and refused to back it. Lloyd Webber personally underwrote the musical and took out a second mortgage on his house for the down payment of the theatre. He later recalled that if &quot;Cats&quot; had been a commercial failure, it would have left him in financial ruin. The remaining capital was eventually raised by small investments procured from 220 individuals through newspaper advertisements. After the musical became a massive hit, the rate of return for these investors was estimated to have exceeded 3,500 per cent.

==Synopsis==

===Act I – When Cats Are Maddened by the Midnight Dance===

After the overture, a tribe of cats known as the Jellicles gather on stage and describe themselves and their purpose (&quot;Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats&quot;). The cats (who break the fourth wall throughout the show) then notice that they are being watched by a human audience, and proceed to explain how the different cats of the tribe are named (&quot;The Naming of Cats&quot;). This is followed by a ballet solo performed by Victoria to signal the beginning of the Jellicle Ball (&quot;The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball&quot;). At this moment, Munkustrap, the show&#x27;s main narrator, explains that tonight the Jellicle patriarch Old Deuteronomy will make an appearance and choose one of the cats to be reborn into a new life on the Heaviside Layer.

Munkustrap introduces the first contender Jennyanydots (&quot;The Old Gumbie Cat&quot;), a large tabby cat who lazes around all day, but come nighttime, she becomes active, teaching mice and cockroaches various activities to curb their naturally destructive habits. Just as Jennyanydots finishes her song, the music changes suddenly and Rum Tum Tugger makes his extravagant entrance in front of the tribe (&quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot;). He is very fickle and unappeasable, &quot;for he will do as he do do, and there&#x27;s no doing anything about it&quot;.

Then, as Rum Tum Tugger&#x27;s song fades, a shabby old grey cat stumbles out wanting to be reconciled; it is Grizabella. All the cats back away from her in fear and disgust and explain her unfortunate state (&quot;Grizabella: The Glamour Cat&quot;). Grizabella leaves and the music changes to a cheerful upbeat number as Bustopher Jones, a fat cat in &quot;a coat of fastidious black&quot;, is brought to the stage (&quot;Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town&quot;). Bustopher Jones is among the elite of the cats, and visits prestigious gentlemen&#x27;s clubs. Suddenly, a loud crash startles the tribe and the cats run offstage in fright. Hushed giggling sounds signal the entrance of Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, a pair of near-identical cats. They are mischievous petty burglars who enjoy causing trouble around their human neighbourhood (&quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer&quot;). After they finish, they are caught off-guard and confronted by the rest of the cats.

Finally, the Jellicle patriarch, Old Deuteronomy, arrives before the tribe (&quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot;). He is a wise old cat who &quot;has lived many lives&quot; and is tasked with choosing which Jellicle will go to the Heaviside Layer every year. The cats put on a play for Old Deuteronomy (&quot;The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles&quot;), telling a story about two dog tribes clashing in the street and subsequently being scared away by the Great Rumpus Cat. A moral from Old Deuteronomy is interrupted by a second loud crash, presumably from Macavity, which sends the alarmed cats scurrying. After a quick patrol for Macavity, Old Deuteronomy deems it a false alarm and summons the cats back as the main celebration begins (&quot;The Jellicle Ball&quot;), in which the cats sing and display their &quot; powers&quot;.

During the Ball, Grizabella reappears and tries to dance along, but her age and decrepit condition prevent her from doing so (&quot;Grizabella: The Glamour Cat (Reprise)&quot;). As a result, she is once again shunned by the other cats, but that does not stop her from vowing to return for another chance to be in the spotlight while a guilty Old Deuteronomy looks on (&quot;Memory (Prelude)&quot;).

===Act II – Why Will the Summer Day Delay – When Will Time Flow Away?===
After the Jellicle Ball, Old Deuteronomy gathers his tribe to contemplate the nature of happiness. Jemima (also known as Sillabub), the youngest of all Jellicles, understands the patriarch is referring to Grizabella, and passes the message on to the rest of the tribe (&quot;The Moments of Happiness&quot;).  – short for Asparagus – shuffles forward as the next cat to be introduced (&quot;Gus: The Theatre Cat&quot;). He was once a famous actor but is now old and &quot;suffers from palsy which makes his paws shake&quot;. He is accompanied by Jellylorum, his caretaker, who tells of his exploits. Gus then remembers how he once played the infamous pirate captain, Growltiger (&quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;). He tells of Growltiger&#x27;s romance with Lady Griddlebone, leading to the pirate&#x27;s capture by a horde of Siamese cats and his execution by walking the plank.

Back in the present, after Gus exits, Skimbleshanks is seen sleeping in the corner (&quot;Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat&quot;). He is the cat who is unofficially in charge of the nightly train from London to Gallowgate, and it will not depart unless he is aboard. Within his song, a whole steam train engine is assembled out of objects in the junkyard.

With a third crash and an evil laugh, the &quot;most wanted&quot; cat Macavity appears. He is the so-called &quot;Napoleon of Crime&quot; who always manages to evade the authorities. Macavity&#x27;s henchmen capture Old Deuteronomy and take off with the patriarch in tow. As Munkustrap and his troop give chase, Demeter and Bombalurina explain what they know about Macavity (&quot;Macavity: The Mystery Cat&quot;). When they are finished, Macavity returns disguised as Old Deuteronomy, but his cover is blown by Demeter and he ends up getting beaten by Munkustrap and Alonzo. Macavity holds his own for a time, but as the rest of the tribe begin to gang up and surround him, he shorts out the stage lights and escapes in the resulting confusion.

After the fight, Rum Tum Tugger calls upon the magician Mr. Mistoffelees for help (&quot;Magical Mr. Mistoffelees&quot;). Known as the &quot;original conjuring cat&quot;, Mr. Mistoffelees can perform feats of magic that no other cat can do. He displays his magical powers in a dance solo and uses them to restore the lights and bring back Old Deuteronomy. Now, the &quot;Jellicle choice&quot; can be made.

Before Old Deuteronomy can make his decision, Grizabella returns to the junkyard and he allows her to address the gathering. Her faded appearance and lonely disposition have little effect on her song (&quot;Memory&quot;). With acceptance and encouragement from Jemima and Victoria, her appeal succeeds and she is chosen to be the one to go to the Heaviside Layer and be reborn into a new Jellicle life (&quot;The Journey to the Heaviside Layer&quot;). A tyre rises from the piles of junk, carrying Grizabella and Old Deuteronomy partway towards the sky; Grizabella then completes the journey on her own. Finally, Old Deuteronomy closes the show by giving his final speech to the audience (&quot;The Ad-dressing of Cats&quot;).

==Artistic elements==

===Musical treatment===

&quot;Cats&quot; is completely told through music with no dialogue in between the songs, although there are occasions when the music accompanies spoken verse. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s compositions employ an eclectic range of musical styles so as to magnify the characters&#x27; contrasting personalities. For example, the rebellious Rum Tum Tugger is introduced with a rock song (&quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot;); the fallen Grizabella is accompanied by a dramatic operatic aria (&quot;Grizabella: The Glamour Cat&quot;); Old Deuteronomy makes his grand entrance to a lullaby-turned-anthem (&quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot;); and Gus&#x27; nostalgia for the past is reflected through an old-fashioned music hall number (&quot;Gus: The Theatre Cat&quot;). Many of the songs are pastiches of their respective genres, which Snelson attributes to the show&#x27;s origins as a song cycle:

Lloyd Webber also employs various techniques to help connect the pieces. Namely, the score relies heavily on recurring motifs as well as the use of preludes and reprises. For instance, melodic fragments of &quot;Memory&quot; are sung by Grizabella and Jemima at several points in the show before the song is sung in full, serving to characterise Grizabella and foreshadow her final number. Similarly, Lloyd Webber introduces a fugue in the overture, and variations of this theme are then repeated throughout the musical until it is finally resolved as Grizabella ascends to the Heaviside Layer.

The musical also features an unusual amount of &quot;group-description&quot; numbers. According to musicologist Jessica Sternfeld, such numbers are usually relegated to the prologue and nothing more, as seen in &quot;Another Op&#x27;nin&#x27;, Another Show&quot; from &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; and &quot;Tradition&quot; from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. &quot;Cats&quot; on the other hand features four Jellicle-defining songs: &quot;Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats&quot;, &quot;The Naming of Cats&quot;, &quot;The Jellicle Ball&quot; and &quot;The Ad-Dressing of Cats&quot;. These numbers allow the cats to celebrate their tribe and species as a whole, in between the ones that celebrate individual members.

===Choreography===

Regarded as &quot;one of the most challenging shows to dance in musical theatre history&quot;, dance plays a major role in &quot;Cats&quot; as the original creative team had specifically set out to create &quot;England&#x27;s first dance musical&quot;. Before &quot;Cats&quot;, the industry-wide belief was that British dancers were inferior to their Broadway counterparts. The risky hiring of a British choreographer, Lynne, for a British dance musical was described by one historian as &quot;a vivid and marvellous gesture of transatlantic defiance&quot;. Making Lynne&#x27;s job more challenging was the fact that the music in &quot;Cats&quot; is unceasing and the majority of the cast remains on-stage throughout nearly the entire show.

Lynne choreographed the original London production with a dance crew consisting of her assistant Lindsay Dolan, the dance captain Jo-Anne Robinson, and cast members Finola Hughes and John Thornton. The resulting choreography blends ballet, modern dance, jazz and tap, interspersed with acrobatic displays. Lynne also trained the cast to evoke the movement, physicality and behaviour of actual cats. These feline traits were incorporated into the movement and choreography so as to create an &quot;anthropomorphic illusion&quot;. Lynne considered the 13-minute &quot;Jellicle Ball&quot; dance to be the crux of the show, noting that in order to work as a dance-driven musical, &quot;Cats&quot; &quot;had to succeed there or die&quot;. She recalled the difficulty she faced in persuading Lloyd Webber to add the extended dance break, culminating in her and her dance crew having to dance all the parts in the &quot;Jellicle Ball&quot; to convince him.

===Staging===
The original staging of &quot;Cats&quot; at the New London Theatre was considered revolutionary and &quot;one of the first truly immersive theatrical experiences&quot;. Instead of a conventional proscenium, the theatre was quasi-in-the-round with a central revolving stage. Nunn and Napier had sought to create &quot;an environment rather than a set&quot;, and around $900,000 was spent remodelling the New London in preparation for the show. This included mounting sections of the stalls onto the theatre&#x27;s revolve such that the audience moved along with the stage. When the show was brought to Broadway, the Winter Garden Theatre was given a similar $2 million makeover; its proscenium stage was converted into a thrust, and a part of its roof was torn through to allow for the effects of Grizabella&#x27;s ascension to the Heaviside Layer.

Nunn was also adamant that the orchestra for &quot;Cats&quot; be hidden backstage — out of the audience&#x27;s view — so as not to break the immersion. Adding to the experience, the show usually includes a lot of audience interaction, such as during the overture when the cast don flashing &quot;green eyes&quot; as they make their way through the audience in the darkened theatre. In the original Broadway production, catwalks were built to connect the stage to the boxes and balcony so as to give the cast access to the entire auditorium during the show.

===Set and costume design===
Napier began designing the set in November 1980, wanting &quot;a place where cats might congregate together, which also included maximum room for dancing&quot;. The set of &quot;Cats&quot; consists of a junkyard filled with oversized props to give the illusion that the cast are the size of actual cats; it remains the same throughout the show without any scene changes. Over 2,500 of these scaled-up props were used to fill the whole auditorium in the original Broadway production.

Napier also designed the costumes, combining cat and human features based on &quot;hints&quot; given in Eliot&#x27;s poems, while ensuring that they did not impede the dancers&#x27; movements. The costumes generally consist of a unitard, a wig that is fashioned to suggest the presence of feline ears, patches resembling body fur, and arm and leg warmers to give the performers&#x27; hands and feet a more paw-like appearance. As with the contrasting music and dance styles, the costumes and make-up are used to bring out each character&#x27;s distinct personality. For example, the costume for the flirtatious Bombalurina is designed to accentuate her sensuality, while the markings on the costume for Jemima — the youngest of the tribe — resemble crayon scribbles. Every character&#x27;s design motif is custom-painted by hand onto a plain unitard to line up with their performer&#x27;s individual body. To reproduce the &quot;hand-drawn aesthetic&quot; of Napier&#x27;s original design sketches, costume painters in the original Broadway production used squeeze bottles to apply the paint. Due to the amount of dancing in &quot;Cats&quot;, most of the costumes did not last longer than a few months.

==Productions==
&quot;Cats&quot; has been translated into over 15 languages and produced professionally in more than 30 countries.

===London===

&quot;Cats&quot; premiered in the West End at the New London Theatre on 11 May 1981. The musical was produced by Mackintosh and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group, with direction by Nunn, choreography by Lynne (who also served as the associate director), set and costume design by Napier, lighting design by David Hersey, sound design by Abe Jacob and music direction by Harry Rabinowitz. It played a total of 8,949 performances before closing on its 21st anniversary, 11 May 2002. The final performance was broadcast live on a large outdoor screen in Covent Garden for fans who could not acquire a ticket. &quot;Cats&quot; held the record as London&#x27;s longest-running musical from 1989, when it surpassed &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, until 8 October 2006, when it was surpassed by &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

The musical returned to the West End in 2014 for a planned 12-week limited run at the London Palladium. Beginning on 6 December, the revival starred Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella, and featured the original creative team, with direction from Nunn, choreography by Lynne and design by Napier. Lloyd Webber was also involved and rewrote &quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot; for the revival. The run was later extended through April 2015 and an additional 100,000 tickets were released, with Kerry Ellis replacing Scherzinger as Grizabella. The musical returned once again to the London Palladium for another limited run lasting from 23 October 2015 to 2 January 2016, starring Beverley Knight as Grizabella.

===Broadway===

&quot;Cats&quot; debuted on Broadway on 7 October 1982 at the Winter Garden Theatre with a record-breaking $6.2 million in ticket pre-sales. The musical was co-produced by the original London production team, along with David Geffen and The Shubert Organization. Most of the original creative team remained, with Martin Levan replacing Jacob as the sound designer and Stanley Lebowsky replacing Rabinowitz as music director. It was the most expensive Broadway show ever mounted at the time with a production cost of $5.5 million, though it recouped its investment in less than 10 months. On 19 June 1997, &quot;Cats&quot; overtook &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; to become the longest-running show in Broadway history with 6,138 performances. At the time, the musical was found to have had an economic impact of $3.12 billion on New York City and had generated the most theatrical jobs of any single entity in Broadway history. In early 2000, the show&#x27;s closing was scheduled for June but it was subsequently pushed back after a resulting surge in ticket sales. The show closed on 10 September 2000 after a total of 15 previews and 7,485 performances. One actress, Marlene Danielle, performed in the Broadway production for its entire 18-year run. Its Broadway-run record was surpassed on 9 January 2006 by &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and &quot;Cats&quot; remains Broadway&#x27;s fifth-longest-running show of all time. Overall, the original Broadway production grossed approximately $388 million in ticket sales.

Encouraged by the reception to the first West End revival, producers began looking to bring &quot;Cats&quot; back to Broadway in early 2015. The Broadway revival opened on 31 July 2016 at the Neil Simon Theatre. It featured new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, with Nunn and Napier from the original creative team returning to direct and design respectively. Scherzinger, who played Grizabella in the 2014 West End revival, had originally agreed to reprise the role on Broadway but later withdrew. Leona Lewis was cast as Grizabella instead, and was succeeded by Mamie Parris three months later in October 2016. The Broadway revival closed on 30 December 2017 after 16 previews and 593 performances.

====Off-Broadway Production (2024)====
The show, under the title &quot;Cats: The Jellicle Ball&quot;, made its Off-Broadway debut at the Perelman Performing Arts Center in June 2024 and was extended twice, closing in September. The show, directed by Zhailon Levingston and Bill Rauch and choreographed by Arturo Lyons and Omari Wiles, was a radical reimagining of the musical taking inspiration from ballroom culture. Josephine Kearns served as dramaturg and gender consultant. André De Shields starred as Old Deuteronomy, with other cast members including Jonathan Burke as Mungojerrie, Sydney James Harcourt as Rum Tum Tugger, Antwayn Hopper as Macavity, Junior LaBeija (the emcee featured in the Ballroom documentary &quot;Paris is Burning&quot;) as Gus, &quot;Tempress&quot; Chasity Moore as Grizabella and Nora Schell as Bustopher Jones. This was the show&#x27;s first major production to depart stylistically from the original.

===North America===
Following its Broadway debut, &quot;Cats&quot; has been staged extensively across North America. The first US national tour, Cats National I, launched at the Shubert Theatre in Boston in December 1983 and closed in November 1987. The opening night cast included Laurie Beechman playing Grizabella and Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise playing Cassandra; later replacements included Victoria Clark and Jessica Molaskey both playing Jellylorum/Griddlebone. This production was a &quot;slow tour&quot; that had lengthy engagements lasting for several months in each of the nine cities it visited. Cats National II, a separate sit-down production at the Los Angeles Shubert Theatre, ran from January 1985 to November 1986, and starred Kim Criswell and George de la Peña in the roles of Grizabella and Mistoffelees respectively. A third US touring company, Cats National III, ran for two years from September 1986 to September 1988. Notable performers in the third tour included Jonathan Cerullo as Skimbleshanks (1986) and Bill Nolte as Old Deuteronomy (1987).

The fourth national company, Cats National IV, toured the United States for 13 years from March 1987 to December 1999. It overtook the first national tour of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in November 1997 to become the longest-running tour in theatre history, and played its 5,000th performance in July 1999. Notable performers in the fourth tour included Amelia Marshall as Sillabub (1988), Jan Horvath as Grizabella (1990), Bryan Batt as Munkustrap (1991–1992), Jennifer Cody as Rumpleteazer (1992), David Hibbard as Rum Tum Tugger (1992–1993), Natalie Toro as Grizabella (1992, 1997), Christopher Gattelli as Mistoffelees (1993), John Treacy Egan as Old Deuteronomy (1993–1994), J. Robert Spencer as Rum Tum Tugger (1995), Bart Shatto as Bustopher Jones/Gus/Growltiger (1996), Linda Balgord as Grizabella (1998), Andy Karl as Rum Tum Tugger (1998), and Lena Hall as Demeter (1998). By June 1997, the North American touring companies had grossed over $400 million.

After the show&#x27;s closure on Broadway in 2000, Troika Entertainment obtained the touring rights for &quot;Cats&quot; and launched the show&#x27;s first non-Equity national company. After a try-out at Harrah&#x27;s Atlantic City in July 2001, the production toured North America for 11 years from August 2001 to June 2012. Performers in the non-Equity tour included Julie Garnyé as Jennyanydots (2001) and Dee Roscioli as Grizabella (2002). In January 2019, a new North American Equity tour based on the 2016 Broadway revival opened at the Providence Performing Arts Center in Rhode Island, and was originally scheduled to run through June 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, performances of this tour were suspended on 13 March 2020. The tour re-launched as a non-Equity production on 21 September 2021.

Meanwhile, the first Canadian national production premiered in March 1985 at the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres in Toronto, Ontario. It moved to Montreal two years later and then toured other parts of Canada. By the time the production closed in August 1989, it had become the most successful Canadian stage production of all time with a box office of $78 million from nearly 2 million tickets. A second All-Canadian company began at Toronto&#x27;s former Panasonic Theatre in May 2013 and ran for four months &amp; 128 performances, 28 years after the original production.

The musical first played in Mexico from April 1991 to November 1992; the Spanish-language production performed over 400 shows and starred María del Sol as Grizabella, Manuel Landeta as Munkustrap, Susana Zabaleta as Jellylorum, Maru Dueñas as Sillabub and Ariel López Padilla as Macavity. A revival premiered at the Teatro San Rafael in May 2013, with an opening night cast that included Filippa Giordano as Grizabella, Landeta, and Maru Dueñas. After a total of 350 performances, the show closed at the Teatro San Rafael in June 2014, and then toured over 36 cities in Mexico until December 2014. Other performers who later joined the production included Lisset, Rocío Banquells, Lila Deneken and Myriam Montemayor Cruz, all of whom played Grizabella. Another Mexican revival was launched at the Coyoacán Centennial Theater in October 2018, with Yuri as Grizabella and Landeta as Old Deuteronomy. The revival marked its 200th performance in May 2019.

===United Kingdom===
The first UK and Ireland tour opened in May 1989 at the Opera House Theatre in Blackpool. The cast for this tour included Marti Webb as Grizabella, Rosemarie Ford as Bombalurina and John Partridge as Alonzo. Following a six-month engagement in Blackpool that broke the theatre&#x27;s box office record and was seen by around 450,000 people, the production moved to the Edinburgh Playhouse for three months, before closing in May 1990 after another two months at the Point Theatre in Dublin. A second national tour launched in June 1993 at the Bristol Hippodrome, featuring Rosemarie Ford as Grizabella, Robin Cousins as Munkustrap, Simon Rice as Mistoffelees and Tony Monopoly as Old Deuteronomy. The tour closed at the Manchester Opera House in December 1995.

Following the closure of the original West End production, a nationwide tour embarked in 2003 with Chrissie Hammond starring as Grizabella, until Dianne Pilkington took over the role in 2006. Hammond reprised the role on tour again from 2007 to 2008.

A UK and Ireland tour of &quot;Cats&quot; launched in February 2013 at the Edinburgh Playhouse with Joanna Ampil as Grizabella. Susan McFadden took over the role from Ampil during the tour&#x27;s three-week stop in Dublin. The production ran through 2014 before transferring to the West End. In between its limited West End runs, the musical returned to the Blackpool Opera House Theatre in 2015, this time starring Jane McDonald as Grizabella. After the second West End revival, the production toured the UK in 2016 with Anita Louise Combe as Grizabella and Marcquelle Ward as Rum Tum Tugger.

===Japan===

The Japanese-language production of &quot;Cats&quot; by the Shiki Theatre Company has been playing continuously since it premiered in Shinjuku, Tokyo, in November 1983. This production is a &quot;slow tour&quot; with engagements lasting for several years in each of the nine cities it has visited. An initial investment of ¥800 million (US$3.4 million in 1983) was required to bring &quot;Cats&quot; to Japan, including ¥300 million for the construction of a purpose-built theatre tailored to the needs of the musical. This was a big financial risk for the Shiki Theatre Company as it meant that a long run was needed to turn a profit; however, stage productions in Japan ran on a monthly basis at the time and open-ended runs were unheard of. The resulting success of this production led to what the local media termed a &quot;musical boom&quot; in the 1980s, with other Broadway musicals quickly following suit and opening in Japan.

, the show is performed at the purpose-built CATS Theatre in Tokyo. The production has played over 10,000 performances to over 10 million audience members.

Similar to the original London staging, the set of the 1,200-capacity CATS Theatre is built on a revolving stage floor such that during the overture, the stage and sections of the stalls revolve approximately 180 degrees into place. In 1998, the Japanese production underwent major revisions to the choreography, staging and costume designs. Following further revisions in 2018, the current incarnation features 27 named cats, including both Jemima and Sillabub (who have evolved into two separate characters), and an original character named Gilbert.

There have been numerous notable performers in the Japanese production, including Shintarō Sonooka as Munkustrap (original 1983 cast), Kanji Ishimaru as Skimbleshanks (1992), Masachika Ichimura, and Mayo Kawasaki. Yoshiko Hattori (:ja:服部良子) holds the production&#x27;s record for the longest-appearing cast member; she played Jennyanydots in the original 1983 cast and remained in the role for 20 years with a final performance tally of 4,251.

===Vienna===
Under the direction of Peter Weck, the first German-language production of &quot;Cats&quot; in Michael Kunze&#x27;s translation opened in September 1983 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, Austria. In 1988, the show transferred to the newly renovated Ronacher Theatre where it ran for another two years before closing on its seventh anniversary in September 1990. The Vienna production played a total of 2,040 performances to more than 2.3 million audience members.

The original Viennese cast included Ute Lemper who played Bombalurina, Steve Barton who played Munkustrap, Robert Montano who played Pouncival, and who played Grizabella. Pia Douwes was also a member of the cast from 1987 to 1989, covering several different characters including Grizabella. The Vienna production also performed limited runs at the Komische Oper Berlin in East Germany in 1987, and at the in the Soviet Union in 1988.

A revival by the Vereinigte Bühnen Wien production company opened at the Ronacher Theatre in September 2019 and closed in June 2022. The revival cast included who played Old Deuteronomy, who played Munkustrap, who played Gus/Growltiger and Bustopher Jones, and who played Grizabella.

===Germany===

Influenced by the show&#x27;s success in Vienna, a German production by Stella Entertainment premiered in April 1986 at the newly renovated Operettenhaus in Hamburg using a new translation by Sabine Grohmann, John Baer, and Marc Henning. It closed in January 2001 after 15 years, having played over 6,100 performances to 6.2 million audiences. &quot;Cats&quot; was the first stage production in the country to be mounted without public funding and was also the first to run for multiple years; its success established the medium as a profitable venture in Germany. The musical was also a huge boost for tourism in Hamburg, particularly the subdivision of St. Pauli where it accounted for 30% of all tourists. The number of overnight visitors to the city increased by over one million per year within the first five years of the show&#x27;s premiere.

&quot;Cats&quot; redefined musical theatre in the German-speaking part of the world, turning an industry which consisted of repertory theatre at the time towards privately funded commercial productions. The success of the Vienna and Hamburg productions sparked a &quot;musical boom&quot; in the region that saw numerous musicals being launched not just in Germany but also in Switzerland. It also led to a &quot;construction boom&quot; in Germany as new theatrical venues such as the Schmidt Theater were enacted all around the country. Germany has since grown to become the third largest musical market after the US and UK, with Hamburg as its &quot;musical capital&quot;.

After Hamburg, the German production transferred to Stuttgart where it played from 2001 to 2002. Stage Entertainment took over the production mid-2002 and moved the show to Berlin (2002–2004) and later Düsseldorf (2004–2005), before touring other cities until 2006. Mehr-Entertainment launched a separate tour of &quot;Cats&quot; that ran from December 2010 to June 2013, performing in a travelling purpose-built tent theatre. Besides Germany, this company also made stops in cities in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Austria.

===Europe===
Beyond the UK, Vienna, and Germany, &quot;Cats&quot; is also produced frequently in the rest of Europe.

====1980s and 1990s====
The first non-English production of &quot;Cats&quot; premiered in March 1983 at the Madách Theatre in Budapest, Hungary, with direction by Tamás Szirtes and choreography by László Seregi. Since then, the Hungarian-language production has continued to be staged intermittently as part of the Madách Theatre&#x27;s repertoire and, as of 2017, has been performed nearly 1,500 times.

November 1985 saw the premiere of a Norwegian-language production at Det Norske Teatret in Oslo. It closed in January 1987 and included performers such as Øivind Blunck, Brit Elisabeth Haagensli and Øystein Wiik. Jorma Uotinen directed and choreographed a Finnish production at the Helsinki City Theatre that ran for over two years from September 1986 to December 1988, and featured Monica Aspelund as Grizabella, Heikki Kinnunen as Gus, and Kristiina Elstelä as Jennyanydots/Griddlebone. A Swedish version of the musical opened in 1987 at the Chinateatern in Stockholm. The production was seen by 326,000 audiences before it transferred to the Scandinavium in Gothenburg two years later.

Meanwhile, the Carré Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands, staged the musical in 1987 (with Ruth Jacott as Grizabella), 1988 and from 1992 to 1993. &quot;Cats&quot; made its French debut at the Théâtre de Paris from February 1989 to April 1990, with an original cast that included Gilles Ramade as Old Deuteronomy. The show was also produced in Zürich at the ABB Musical Theatre from 1991 to 1993, while a production by Joop van den Ende and the Royal Ballet of Flanders was staged at the Stadsschouwburg Antwerpen in Belgium in 1996. An English/German-language &quot;Eurotour&quot; production also toured the region from May 1994 to December 1995.

====21st century====

The show was staged at the Det Ny Teater in Copenhagen, Denmark, in the 2002–2003 season. This Danish production was translated by Adam Price and was one of the largest theatrical productions ever mounted in the country at the time with 100 performers, musicians and stagehands. The first non-replica production of &quot;Cats&quot; was approved for a Polish production at the Teatr Muzyczny Roma in Warsaw. Set in an abandoned film studio instead of a junkyard, the Polish version opened in January 2004 and closed in 2010. The Gothenburg opera house staged a production with a Swedish-language script by Ingela Forsman; this version was reimagined to take place in an abandoned fairground and played from September 2006 to February 2007. Other productions were also staged at the Divadlo Milenium in Prague from 2004 to 2005, and a Norwegian revival at the Chat Noir in Oslo in 2009. The first Italian-language production began touring Italy in 2009.

The Dutch live entertainment company Stage Entertainment has been responsible for several European productions of &quot;Cats&quot;. The company produced the musical at the Coliseum Theatre in Madrid from December 2003 to January 2005, with a cast that included Víctor Ullate Roche as Mistoffelees. They then staged a Russian-language production at the Moscow Palace of Youth from 2005 to 2006, with a cast that included Ivan Ozhogin as Munkustrap. A Dutch production under the same company toured the Netherlands and Belgium from 2006 to 2007, featuring several performers in the role of Grizabella including Pia Douwes and Anita Meyer. A Paris revival by Stage Entertainment ran at the Théâtre Mogador from October 2015 to July 2016. This production was based on the 2014 London revival and also featured a new song written especially for the French show by Lloyd Webber.

English-language touring companies have also toured the European region extensively. International tours in the early to late 2000s included stops in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Greece, Portugal, Germany, and Italy. The 2013–2014 UK tour visited cities in Belgium, Greece, Italy, Monaco, and Portugal. Most recently, a UK production played in numerous European cities from 2016 to 2019, with tour stops in Switzerland, Croatia, Belgium, Poland, Bulgaria, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. These European tours have featured several notable performers in the role of Grizabella, including Pernilla Wahlgren (Sweden; 2003), Katarína Hasprová (Slovakia; 2016) and Jenna Lee-James (Netherlands; 2018–2019).

===Oceania===
The first Australian production ran from July 1985 to August 1987 at the Theatre Royal in Sydney. The original cast included Debra Byrne as Grizabella, John Wood as Old Deuteronomy, Marina Prior as Jellylorum, Jeff Phillips as Rum Tum Tugger, David Atkins as Mistoffelees, and Anita Louise Combe as Sillabub. The Sydney production cost $3 million to mount and grossed a record $28 million. It was credited with revitalising the then-stagnant musical genre in Australia. After closing in Sydney, an additional $1.8 million was spent transferring the production to Melbourne, including $725,000 to refurbish the old Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. The Melbourne run played from October 1987 to December 1988, with an opening night cast that included Megan Williams as Grizabella, Wood as Old Deuteronomy, Phillips as Rum Tum Tugger, Linda Hartley-Clark as Demeter, Femi Taylor as Bombalurina, Rachael Beck as Rumpleteazer and Seán Martin Hingston as Plato/Macavity. From 1989 to 1990, the company toured the Festival Theatre in Adelaide, His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Perth, Civic Theatre in Newcastle, Lyric Theatre in Brisbane, and the St. James Theatre in Auckland. This was followed by a second national tour from 1993 to 1996, during which Delia Hannah made her debut as Grizabella in 1994. A professional circus adaptation of &quot;Cats&quot;, titled &quot;Cats Run Away to the Circus&quot;, had a national tent tour from 1999 to 2001, with Hannah once again starring as Grizabella. Hannah reprised her role for another production that toured Australia and Asia in 2009 and 2010.

In July 2014, Australia&#x27;s Harvest Rain Theatre Company staged the biggest production of &quot;Cats&quot; in the Southern Hemisphere with over 700 performers. Produced by Tim O&#x27;Connor, the production was performed at the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. Callum Mansfield directed and choreographed it, and its cast included Marina Prior as Grizabella and Steven Tandy as Bustopher Jones and Gus. From October 2015 to May 2016, a revival toured Australia with stops in Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. The revival featured singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem as Grizabella, before Delia Hannah took over the role during the Adelaide and Perth seasons.

The show returned to Auckland in 1995 as part of a three-city New Zealand tour, and again in 2015 preceding the 2015/16 Australian tour. A New Zealand national tour played across 16 cities in 2019, with a reimagined setting in a derelict Victorian theatre that was inspired by post-earthquake Christchurch. 
A 2025 Australia production will return in June 2025.

===Asia===
Besides Japan, &quot;Cats&quot; is also produced regularly in other parts of Asia. The region has hosted numerous English-language productions of the musical, beginning with a tour from 1993 to 1994 when it played in Singapore (with local actress Jacintha Abisheganaden as Grizabella), Hong Kong and South Korea. &quot;Cats&quot; returned to Asia from 2002 to 2004, when an international touring company performed in Malaysia, South Korea, Shanghai, Taipei and Beijing; the 2004 cast included Slindile Nodangala in the role of Grizabella. A touring company visited Asia again between 2007 and 2010, including stops in the region of Taiwan, Macau, and Thailand in 2007; South Korea from 2007 to 2008; China in 2008; Singapore and Hong Kong in 2009 (with Delia Hannah playing Grizabella); and Manila in 2010 (with Lea Salonga as Grizabella). &quot;Cats&quot; toured Asia again from 2014 to 2015, making stops in South Korea, Singapore and Macau. Two years later, another Asian tour was launched and is scheduled to run through 2020, with visits to South Korea from 2017 to 2018, Hong Kong and Taiwan in 2018, China in 2018 (with Joanna Ampil as Grizabella) and 2019, and planned stops in the Philippines and Singapore in 2019, and Malaysia in 2020. &quot;Cats&quot; was China&#x27;s highest-grossing musical in 2018, accounting for over 20% of the total grosses from all musicals staged in the country that year.

The musical has also been translated and staged nationally in Asia. From September 2008 to May 2009, a Korean-language production toured South Korea, with Shin Youngsook and Ock Joo-hyun alternating as Grizabella, Kim Jin-woo and Daesung alternating as Rum Tum Tugger, and Kim Bo-kyung as Rumpleteazer. This production was revived and toured South Korea from 2011 to 2012, with Insooni and Park Hae-mi taking turns to portray Grizabella. The first Chinese-language production began touring various cities in China in 2012.

===Others===
Spanish and Portuguese-language productions of &quot;Cats&quot; have been staged in South America, with productions in Argentina in 1993 (with Mexican actress Olivia Bucio as Grizabella), in Chile in 2006 (at the Arena Santiago) and 2014, in Colombia in 2009, and in Brazil in 2010 (with Paula Lima as Grizabella).
Other countries that the musical has been performed in include South Africa (2001–2002), Lebanon (2002), Qatar (2003, 2017), Turkey (2013), Israel (2014), and the United Arab Emirates (2017).

A full-length production of &quot;Cats&quot; has been performed regularly for guests aboard Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s cruise ship &quot;Oasis of the Seas&quot;, starting in autumn 2014, with a cast rotating every nine months.

===Regional and amateur===

&quot;Cats&quot; has been produced by various professional regional theatre companies. Broadway Sacramento staged the musical in 2003 and 2009 at the Wells Fargo Pavilion. Both productions featured Ken Page reprising his role as Old Deuteronomy from the original Broadway production, along with Jacquelyn Piro Donovan as Grizabella and Jeffry Denman as Munkustrap. A 2010 amphitheatre production at The Muny starred Page as Old Deuteronomy, Stephanie J. Block as Grizabella and Lara Teeter as Munkustrap. The La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts staged the musical in 2014, with a cast that included Todrick Hall as Rum Tum Tugger.

Nick Winston directed and choreographed a production at the Kilworth House Theatre in 2019 with a cast that included Emma Hatton and Helen Anker. Set in a dilapidated London Underground station during World War II, this production was given a 5-star review by &quot;The Stage&quot; for its &quot;radical&quot; reimagining of &quot;Cats&quot;.

The musical is also available for school and amateur licensing through The Musical Company. On 24 March 2013, the largest-ever staging of &quot;Cats&quot; was performed by 3,000 students from Stagecoach Theatre Arts schools at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, UK.

==Film adaptations==

Steven Spielberg&#x27;s former animation studio Amblimation had planned an animated adaptation of the musical in the 1990s. The film was to be set in war-torn London during World War II, but the project was abandoned with the studio&#x27;s closure in 1997. The following year, a direct-to-video film was released. The film was directed by David Mallet and was shot at the Adelphi Theatre in London. It starred Elaine Paige as Grizabella, John Mills as Gus, Ken Page as Old Deuteronomy, and Michael Gruber as Munkustrap.

A film adaptation directed by Tom Hooper for Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment and Working Title Films was released on 20 December 2019. The film starred James Corden as Bustopher Jones, Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy, Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger, Idris Elba as Macavity, Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella, Ian McKellen as Gus, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Francesca Hayward as Victoria. Swift collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber for a new song called &quot;Beautiful Ghosts.&quot; The movie was negatively received by both critics and audiences, and was also a box-office bomb. Andrew Lloyd Webber disowned the film, claiming that it convinced him to get a therapy dog.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cats&quot; is a commercial blockbuster. Its worldwide box office gross of over US$2 billion by 1994 made it the highest grossing musical in history at the time.

===Critical reception===
====London====
The original London production received mostly rave reviews, with critics hailing it as a watershed moment in British musical theatre. Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; lauded &quot;Cats&quot; as &quot;an exhilarating piece of total theatre&quot;. Billington praised the show&#x27;s &quot;strong framework&quot; and the ease in which the poems were integrated. He was also very impressed by Lloyd Webber&#x27;s fitting compositions, Napier&#x27;s environmental set, Lynne&#x27;s effective and at times brilliant choreography, and Nunn&#x27;s &quot;dazzling staging&quot; that makes use of the entire auditorium. The show received similarly glowing reviews from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ Derek Jewell and &quot;The Stage&quot;″s Peter Hepple. Jewell proclaimed it to be &quot;among the most exhilarating and innovative musicals ever staged&quot;, while Hepple declared that with &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;the British musical has taken a giant leap forward, surpassing in ingenuity and invention anything Broadway has sent us&quot;.

There were a few lukewarm reviews, most notably from Irving Wardle of &quot;The Times&quot;. Wardle enjoyed Lloyd Webber&#x27;s compositions but found the visual spectacle too overwhelming. Robert Cushman&#x27;s review for &quot;The Observer&quot; concluded that &quot;Cats&quot; was flawed but unmissable.

The reviews for the 2014 and 2015 London revivals were positive as well, with critics giving both productions an average of 4 out of 5 stars. Critics generally found the revivals to be enjoyable and invigorating, though Mark Shenton was disappointed that the new staging lacked the immersiveness of the original.

====Broadway====
Reactions to the original Broadway production were mixed. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Frank Rich said the main draw of the show was that it &quot;transports the audience into a complete fantasy world that could only exist in the theater&quot;. He attributed much of this &quot;wondrous spectacle&quot; to Nunn&#x27;s direction, Napier&#x27;s set and costume designs, as well as the cast. Rich found many of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s songs to be &quot;cleverly and appropriately&quot; pastiche, but panned Lynne&#x27;s choreography and felt that the musical failed in its vague attempt to tell a story. Overall, he wished the show had more &quot;feeling to go with its most inventive stagecraft.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; Brendan Gill wrote: &quot;Judged as a spectacle instead of simply as a musical, &#x27;Cats&#x27; is a triumph.&quot; Conversely, Sylviane Gold of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; called the musical &quot;an overproduced trifle, a cabaret evening tricked out in Broadway regalia.&quot; Edwin Wilson of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described &quot;Cats&quot; as an &quot;anomaly&quot;, writing that &quot;[t]he world it creates is refreshingly novel [...] and Mr. Webber has composed a score of eminently hummable tunes,&quot; but noting there was a disconnect between the immense scale of the production and the simplicity of Eliot&#x27;s lyrics. Clive Barnes of the &quot;New York Post&quot; concluded his review saying: &quot;Its importance lies in its wholeheartedness. It is a statement of musical theater that cannot be ignored, should prove controversial and will never be forgotten.&quot;

The 2016 Broadway revival received a similarly mixed review by Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Isherwood concluded that the revival was &quot;fundamentally the &quot;Cats&quot; you knew and loved when you were first bit by the musical-theater bug. Or it&#x27;s the &quot;Cats&quot; you knew and snickered at when you first encountered it.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Cats&quot; has received many international awards and nominations. The original London production was nominated for six Laurence Olivier Awards in 1981, winning two awards including Best New Musical. Two years later, the original Broadway production won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of eleven nominations. The London and were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album, which the latter won. In 2015, the London revival was nominated for — but did not win — two Olivier Awards, including Best Musical Revival.

==Cultural impact and legacy==

Despite mixed reviews when &quot;Cats&quot; opened in New York in 1982, critics agreed that it was innovative and visually spectacular in ways that Broadway had never seen before. The musical became a cultural phenomenon and has had a profound influence on the medium. &quot;Cats&quot; established musical theatre as a global commodity, marking the beginning of a new era in the industry that is characterised by huge global stakes for potentially even huger global profits. It led the shift in the Broadway market towards big-budget blockbusters and shows that appeal to families and tourists, which in turn left smaller productions struggling to compete. &quot;Cats&quot; also ushered in a &quot;golden age of British musicals&quot; which saw West End exports dominate the industry for nearly two decades. Musical theatre historian Vagelis Siropoulos asserted that in terms of impact, the &quot;seminal Broadway opening&quot; of &quot;Cats&quot; was &quot;comparable only to Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; thirty nine years ago.&quot;

Ultimately, critics are polarized on whether &quot;Cats&quot; has changed musical theatre for the better or for the worse. William Grimes wrote of its detractors: &quot;There are more than a few who see the &quot;Cats&quot; phenomenon as the theatrical equivalent of the rise of the megabudget Hollywood action film. For them, &quot;Cats&quot; is a soulless money machine.&quot;

===Influence and innovations===
As the &quot;first true megamusical&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot; pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals — including &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1985), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1986) and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1989) — that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained:


&quot;Cats&quot; introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes (despite many positive reviews) or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting — and then aggressively promoting — a single recognisable image (the cat&#x27;s-eyes logo) as the face of the show. The cat&#x27;s-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline (&quot;now and forever&quot;) to create what &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called &quot;one of musical theatre&#x27;s greatest posters&quot;. Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and the Phantom&#x27;s mask for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called &quot;critic-proof&quot; status of megamusicals.

Additionally, &quot;Cats&quot; was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat&#x27;s-eyes logo. The official &quot;Cats&quot; t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry.

Beyond the megamusical, &quot;Cats&quot; also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: &quot;&quot;Cats&quot; is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.&quot; Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to &quot;Cats&quot;, citing the latter&#x27;s disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience.
The musical&#x27;s fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey&#x27;s pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an &quot;architectural manner&quot;, with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience&#x27;s perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of &quot;Cats&quot; was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre.

&quot;Cats&quot; opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote:

In the 1980s, the success of local productions of &quot;Cats&quot; in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities (and their respective countries) as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited the regional and touring productions of &quot;Cats&quot; with &quot;almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business&quot;. &quot;Cats&quot; revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh&#x27;s insistence that all touring productions of &quot;Cats&quot; replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical&#x27;s demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.

===&quot;Memory&quot;===

&quot;Memory&quot; is the standout hit song from &quot;Cats&quot;. By 2002, the song had been played over two million times on radio and television stations in the US. It was the most requested song at piano bars and lounges in the 1980s, and was an equally popular choice at weddings, concerts and other gatherings. As of 2006, the song had been recorded around 600 times by artists such as Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow, Judy Collins, and Johnny Mathis, in covers ranging from easy listening to techno. According to Sternfeld, it is &quot;by some estimations the most successful song ever from a musical.&quot;

===Creators===

Despite moderate hits with &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;, Lloyd Webber was still relatively unknown to the general public before &quot;Cats&quot;, especially in the US. With &quot;Cats&quot;, he became a big celebrity in his own right. The musical also established the theatrical careers of the original creative and production team. Following &quot;Cats&quot;, they collaborated on other global blockbusters including &quot;Starlight Express&quot; (composed by Lloyd Webber, directed by Nunn and designed by Napier), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (directed by Nunn, designed by Napier and produced by Mackintosh), and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (composed by Lloyd Webber, choreographed by Lynne and produced by Mackintosh).

The New London Theatre, where the original London production of &quot;Cats&quot; played for 21 years, was officially renamed the Gillian Lynne Theatre in 2018. This made Lynne the first non-royal woman to have a West End theatre named after her.

Valerie Eliot used a portion of the royalty payments from &quot;Cats&quot; to establish the literary charity Old Possum&#x27;s Practical Trust, and to set up the T. S. Eliot Prize which has since become &quot;the most coveted award in poetry&quot;. &quot;Cats&quot; also turned things around for the independent British publishing house Faber and Faber. As the publisher of &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;, royalties of up to £1 million annually kept the then-struggling Faber afloat during the 1980s. Moreover, the musical led to a surge in the sales of Eliot&#x27;s book. The success of &quot;Cats&quot; led Faber to turn another of their literary properties, Ted Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Iron Man&quot;, into a 1989 musical of the same name.

===In popular culture===
&quot;Cats&quot; has been referenced many times on screen; from the films &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; and &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, to the sketch comedy &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and animated series like &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, as well as live action comedies including &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Caroline in the City&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;. An episode of the musical television series &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, titled &quot;I Need Some Balance&quot;, parodied &quot;Cats&quot; by having all the songs sung by anthropomorphic cats who &quot;introduce [themselves] over &#x27;80s Broadway beats&quot;.

Stage parodies of the musical have also been mounted in the West End and Off-Broadway. &quot;CAT – (THE PLAY!!!)&quot;, a one-man show written by Jamie Beamish and Richard Hardwick, is a dark comedy about the fictitious life of Dave, a cat who was fired from the original London production of &quot;Cats&quot; on opening night. Starring Gerard McCarthy as Dave and with choreography by Arlene Phillips, the musical premiered at the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festival; it performed at various regional venues before making its West End debut at the Ambassadors Theatre in April 2017. &quot;Katdashians! Break the Musical!&quot;, a parody mashup of &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot; and &quot;Cats&quot; by Bob and Tobly McSmith, premiered Off-Broadway at the Elektra Theatre in June 2016. All the song parodies of &quot;Cats&quot; were later removed after accusations of copyright infringement from Lloyd Webber&#x27;s representatives, who claimed the songs were being used &quot;to parody another subject matter entirely&quot;. Other stage shows that satirise &quot;Cats&quot; include &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;, &quot;Angels in America&quot;, and &quot;The Musical of Musicals (The Musical!)&quot;.

Madame Tussauds New York features wax figures of several characters from the musical, including one of Grizabella that sings &quot;Memory&quot; through the use of projection mapping technology. Similarly, a wax figure of Rumpleteazer is displayed at the Panoptikum wax museum in Hamburg, Germany.

A &quot;Cats&quot; postage stamp was issued by the United States Postal Service in 2000 as part of its Celebrate the Century series. The musical was chosen as one of fifteen &quot;outstanding artifacts, events and activities&quot; from the 1980s to be commemorated with its own stamp design. Beginning in March 2019, the Rinkai Line in Tokyo, Japan, uses two songs from the musical for its train departure melodies at the Ōimachi Station; the train to Ōsaki Station uses a jingle of &quot;Memory&quot;, while the train to Shin-Kiba Station uses a jingle of &quot;Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat&quot;.

The visual effects of the 2019 film adaptation were mocked in the 2022 Disney film &quot;Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, in a scene where the titular characters notice two alley cats resembling the ones in the film as they venture through an &quot;uncanny valley&quot; part of town.

==Revisions and cut material==
The stage production of &quot;Cats&quot; has undergone several revisions since its London opening. When the show transferred to Broadway, several cuts and rewrites were made with the intention of appealing more to an American audience. Additionally, a song entitled &quot;Cat Morgan Introduces Himself&quot; was cut during initial development. Lloyd Webber performed this song at the show&#x27;s 6,138th Broadway performance, when it broke the record to become the longest-running Broadway show.

===&quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;===
The &quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; sequence has been changed multiple times over the course of the show&#x27;s history. In the original London production, the &quot;last duet&quot; for Growltiger and Griddlebone was a setting for an unpublished Eliot poem, &quot;The Ballad of Billy M&#x27;Caw&quot;. For the original Broadway production, the Ballad was replaced with &quot;In Una Tepida Notte&quot;, a parody of Italian opera with more slapstick humour. This new version was eventually incorporated into all other productions of &quot;Cats&quot;.

&quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; has been criticised as being racially offensive. The original lyrics, taken directly from the Eliot poem it is based on, included the ethnic slur &quot;Chinks&quot; and this was later replaced with the word &quot;Siamese&quot;. The number also originally involved the cast putting on &quot;Asian accents&quot; to portray the Siamese cats.
In the 1998 video version, the entire scene featuring Growltiger was cut. By 2016, &quot;Growltiger&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; had been removed completely from the US and UK productions of the show.

===Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer===
In the original London production, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were characters in their own right and sang their eponymous song themselves as a singsong-style duet. When the show transferred to Broadway, the song was instead sung in the third-person, with Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer as puppets being magically controlled by Mr. Mistoffelees. Their number was also rewritten to be faster and more upbeat, alternating between vaudeville-style verses and a &quot;manic patter&quot; section. Eventually, the Broadway version of the song was rewritten to allow Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer to once again sing their own song as full characters.

===Rum Tum Tugger===
The 2014 London revival introduced several modernisations to the show. Rum Tum Tugger was reworked from a ladies-man rockstar to a breakdancing street cat. His eponymous musical number was also turned into a rap. The 2015 Australian tour and 2015 Paris production also used the new version of the character; however, the 2016 Broadway revival did not.

===Choreography===
The 2016 Broadway revival featured new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, who introduced more hip hop and cool jazz elements to the movements and dances. Blankenbuehler&#x27;s choreography for the ensemble numbers did not differ too much from the original by Lynne, but significant changes were made in several solo numbers, including &quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot; and &quot;Mr. Mistoffelees&quot;.

<text>Jazz fusion (also known as jazz rock, jazz-rock fusion, or simply fusion) is a popular music genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined jazz harmony and improvisation with rock music, funk, and rhythm and blues. Electric guitars, amplifiers, and keyboards that were popular in rock began to be used by jazz musicians, particularly those who had grown up listening to rock and roll.

Jazz fusion arrangements vary in complexity. Some employ groove-based vamps fixed to a single key or a single chord with a simple, repeated melody. Others use elaborate chord progressions, unconventional time signatures, or melodies with counter-melodies. These arrangements, whether simple or complex, typically include improvised sections that can vary in length, much like in other forms of jazz.

As with jazz, jazz fusion can employ brass and woodwind instruments such as trumpet and saxophone, but other instruments often substitute for these. A jazz fusion band is less likely to use piano and double bass, and more likely to use electric guitar, electric piano, synthesizers, and bass guitar.

The term &quot;jazz rock&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;jazz fusion&quot; and for music performed by late 1960s- and 1970s-era rock bands that added jazz elements to their music. After a decade of popularity during the 1970s, fusion expanded its improvisatory and experimental approaches through the 1980s in parallel with the development of a radio-friendly style called smooth jazz. Experimentation continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Fusion albums, even those that are made by the same group or artist, may include a variety of musical styles. Rather than being a codified musical style, fusion can be viewed as a musical tradition or approach.

==History==
===Coryell and two worlds===
When John Coltrane died in 1967, rock was the most popular music in America, and &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine went so far as to declare in a headline that: &quot;Jazz as We Know It Is Dead&quot;. AllMusic states that &quot;until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate&quot;.

Guitarist Larry Coryell, sometimes called the godfather of fusion, referred to a generation of musicians who had grown up on rock and roll when he said, &quot;We loved Miles but we also loved the Rolling Stones.&quot; In 1966, he started the band the Free Spirits with Bob Moses on drums and recorded the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Out of Sight and Sound&quot;, released in 1967. That same year, &quot;DownBeat&quot; began to report on rock music. After the Free Spirits, Coryell was part of a quartet led by vibraphonist Gary Burton, releasing the album &quot;Duster&quot; with its rock guitar influence. Burton produced the album &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; for Count&#x27;s Jam Band, which included Coryell, Mike Nock, and Steve Marcus, all of them former students at Berklee College in Boston.

The pioneers of fusion emphasized exploration, energy, electricity, intensity, virtuosity, and volume. Charles Lloyd played a combination of rock and jazz at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 with a quartet that included Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette. Lloyd adopted the trappings of the California psychedelic rock scene by playing at the rock venue the Fillmore West, wearing colorful clothes, and giving his albums titles like &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; and &quot;Forest Flower&quot;, which were bestselling jazz albums in 1967. Flautist Jeremy Steig experimented with jazz in his band Jeremy &amp; the Satyrs with vibraphonist Mike Mainieri. The jazz label Verve released the first album (&quot;Freak Out&quot;) by rock guitarist Frank Zappa in 1966. Rahsaan Roland Kirk performed with Jimi Hendrix at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London.

===Miles Davis plugs in===
As members of Miles Davis&#x27; band, Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock played electric piano on &quot;Filles de Kilimanjaro&quot;. Davis wrote in his autobiography that in 1968 he had been listening to Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, and Sly and the Family Stone. When Davis recorded &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; in 1969, he mostly abandoned the swing beat in favor of a rock and roll backbeat and bass guitar grooves. The album &quot;mixed free jazz blowing by a large ensemble with electronic keyboards and guitar, plus a dense mix of percussion&quot;. Davis played his trumpet like an electric guitar—plugged in to electronic effects and pedals.

By the end of the first year, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; sold 400,000 copies, four times the average for a Miles Davis album. Over the next two years, the aloof Davis recorded more often, worked with many sidemen, appeared on television, and performed at rock venues. Just as quickly, Davis tested the loyalty of rock fans by continuing to experiment. His producer, Teo Macero, inserted previously recorded material into the &quot;Jack Johnson&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Live-Evil&quot;, and &quot;On the Corner&quot;.

Although &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; gave him a gold record, the use of electric instruments and rock beats created consternation among some jazz critics, who accused Davis of betraying the essence of jazz. Music critic Kevin Fellezs commented that some members of the jazz community regarded rock music as less sophisticated and more commercial than jazz.

Davis&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; is considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long improvised suites edited heavily by Teo Macero, the album was made by pioneers of jazz fusion: Corea, Hancock, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and John McLaughlin.

&quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot; (1971) has been cited as &quot;the purest electric jazz record ever made&quot; and &quot;one of the most remarkable jazz rock discs of the era&quot;.

According to music journalist Zaid Mudhaffer, the term &quot;jazz fusion&quot; was coined in a review of &quot;Song of Innocence&quot; by David Axelrod when it was released in 1968. Axelrod said Davis had played the album before conceiving &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;.

===Davis sidemen branch out===
Miles Davis was one of the first jazz musicians to incorporate jazz fusion into his material. He also proved to be a good judge of talented sidemen. Several of the players he chose for his early fusion work went on to success in their own bands. His guitar player John McLaughlin branched out, forming his own fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra. Blending Indian classical music, jazz, and psychedelic rock, they created a whole new style just as Davis had. Davis&#x27;s albums during this period, including In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, A Tribute to Jack Johnson, &quot;Live-Evil&quot; and On the Corner, featured McLaughlin.

Davis dropped out of music in 1975 because of problems with drugs and alcohol, but his sidemen took advantage of the creative and financial vistas that had been opened. Herbie Hancock brought elements of funk, disco, and electronic music into commercially successful albums such as &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973) and &quot;Feets, Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot; (1979). Several years after recording &quot;Miles in the Sky&quot; with Davis, guitarist George Benson became a vocalist with enough pop hits to overshadow his earlier career in jazz.

While Davis was sidelined, Chick Corea gained prominence. In the early 1970s Corea combined jazz, rock, pop, and Brazilian music in Return to Forever, a band that included Stanley Clarke on bass guitar and Al Di Meola on electric guitar. Corea divided the rest of his career between acoustic and electric music, non-commercial and commercial, jazz and pop rock, with a band for each: the Akoustic Band and the Elektric Band.

Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter started very influential jazz fusion band Weather Report in 1970 and developed successful career along with major musicians like Alphonse Mouzon, Jaco Pastorius, Airto Moreira and Miroslav Vitouš until 1986.

Tony Williams was a member of Davis&#x27;s band since 1963. Williams reflected, &quot;I wanted to create a different atmosphere from the one I had been in...What better way to do it than to go electric?&quot; He left Davis to form the Tony Williams Lifetime with English guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young. The band combined rock intensity and loudness with jazz spontaneity. The debut album &quot;Emergency!&quot; was recorded three months before &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;.

Although McLaughlin had worked with Miles Davis, he was influenced more by Jimi Hendrix and had played with English rock musicians Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger before creating the Mahavishnu Orchestra around the same time that Corea started Return to Forever. McLaughlin had been a member of Tony Williams&#x27;s Lifetime. He brought to his music many of the elements that interested other musicians in the 1960s and early 1970s: counterculture, rock and roll, electronic instruments, solo virtuosity, experimentation, the blending of genres, and an interest in the exotic, such as Indian music. He formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra with drummer Billy Cobham, violinist Jerry Goodman, bassist Rick Laird, and keyboardist Jan Hammer. The band released its first album, &quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot;, in 1971. Hammer pioneered the use of the Minimoog synthesizer with distortion effects. His use of the pitch bend wheel made a keyboard sound like an electric guitar. The Mahavishnu Orchestra was influenced by both psychedelic rock and Indian classical music. The band&#x27;s first lineup broke up after two studio albums and one live album, but McLaughlin formed another group in 1974 under the same name with jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, one of the first electric violinists.

After leaving the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1975 Jean-Luc Ponty signed with Atlantic and released number of successful jazz fusion solo albums that entered top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts in mid &#x27;70s — &#x27;80s.

During the late 1970s, Lee Ritenour, Stuff, George Benson, Spyro Gyra, the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton released fusion albums.

==Jazz rock==
The term &quot;jazz-rock&quot; (or &quot;jazz/rock&quot;) is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;jazz fusion&quot;. The Free Spirits have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz rock band.

Rock bands such as Colosseum, Chicago, The Ides of March, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Chase, Santana, Soft Machine, Nucleus, Brand X, the Mothers of Invention and IF blended jazz and rock with electric instruments. Davis&#x27; fusion jazz was &quot;pure melody and tonal color&quot;, while Frank Zappa&#x27;s music was more &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;unpredictable&quot;. Zappa released the solo album &quot;Hot Rats&quot; in 1969. The album contained long instrumental pieces with a jazz influence. Zappa released two albums, &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;, in 1972 which were influenced by jazz. George Duke and Aynsley Dunbar played on both. 1970s band Steely Dan has been lauded by music critic Neil McCormick for their &quot;smooth, smart jazz-rock fusion&quot;.

The jazz artists of the 1960s and 1970s had a large impact on many rock groups of that era such as Santana and Frank Zappa. They took jazz phrasing and harmony and incorporated it into modern rock music, significantly changing music history and paving the way for artists that would follow in their footsteps. Carlos Santana in particular has given much credit to Miles Davis and the influence he had on his music. While Miles Davis combined jazz with modal and rock influences, Carlos Santana combined these along with Latin rhythms and feel, shaping a whole new genre, Latin rock. Other rock artists such as Gary Moore, The Grateful Dead, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, John Scofield, and The Allman Brothers Band have taken influences from blues, jazz, blues rock, jazz rock and incorporated it into their own music.

According to AllMusic, the term jazz rock &quot;may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation...jazz rock first emerged during the late &#x27;60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer-songwriter movement.&quot;

According to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, jazz rock paralleled free jazz by being &quot;on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s&quot;. He said the albums &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1969) by the Tony Williams Lifetime and &quot;Agharta&quot; (1975) by Miles Davis &quot;suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before&quot;. This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre &quot;mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio&quot; at the end of the 1970s.

In the 1970s, American fusion was being combined in the U.K. with progressive rock and psychedelic music. Bands who were part of this movement included Brand X (with Phil Collins of Genesis), Bruford (Bill Bruford of Yes), Nucleus (led by Ian Carr), and Soft Machine. Throughout Europe and the world this movement grew due to bands like Magma in France, Passport in Germany, Time, Leb i Sol and September in Yugoslavia, and guitarists Jan Akkerman (The Netherlands), Volker Kriegel (Germany), Terje Rypdal (Norway), Jukka Tolonen (Finland), Ryo Kawasaki (Japan), and Kazumi Watanabe (Japan).

==Jazz metal==
Jazz metal is the fusion of jazz fusion and jazz rock with heavy metal. Animals as Leaders&#x27; albums &quot;The Joy of Motion&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Madness of Many&quot; (2016) have been described as progressive metal combined with jazz fusion. Panzerballett blends jazz with heavy metal. Imperial Triumphant combines jazz with death metal and black metal.
==Jazz pop==
Jazz pop (or pop-jazz, also called jazzy pop) is pop music with jazz instruments, soft production, commercially viable, and radio-friendly. In jazz pop, the music has less improvisation, but retains the melody and swing of jazz. Robert Palmer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited that jazz pop should be distinguished from jazz rock.

Examples of jazz-pop musicians are Kenny G, Bob James, and George Benson. Frank Sinatra has been referred to as a vocalist whose style blended jazz influences with traditional pop and crooning. A more recent example of a vocalist described as jazz-pop is Laufey.

== Smooth jazz ==

By the early 1980s, much of the original fusion genre was subsumed into other branches of jazz and rock, especially smooth jazz, a radio-friendly subgenre of fusion which is influenced by R&amp;B, funk, and pop music. Smooth jazz can be traced to at least the late 1960s, when producer Creed Taylor worked with guitarist Wes Montgomery on three popular music-oriented albums. Taylor founded CTI Records and many established jazz performers recorded for CTI, including Freddie Hubbard, Chet Baker, George Benson, and Stanley Turrentine. Albums under Taylor&#x27;s guidance were aimed at both pop and jazz fans.

The merging of jazz and pop/rock music took a more commercial direction in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the form of compositions with a softer sound palette that could fit comfortably in a soft rock radio playlist. The AllMusic guide&#x27;s article on fusion states that &quot;unfortunately, as it became a money-maker and as rock declined artistically from the mid-&#x27;70s on, much of what was labeled fusion was actually a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&amp;B.&quot;

Michael and Randy Brecker produced funk-influenced jazz with soloists. David Sanborn was considered a &quot;soulful&quot; and &quot;influential&quot; voice. However, Kenny G was criticized by both fusion and jazz fans, and some musicians, while having become a huge commercial success. Music reviewer George Graham argues that the &quot;so-called &#x27;smooth jazz&#x27; sound of people like Kenny G has none of the fire and creativity that marked the best of the fusion scene during its heyday in the 1970s.&quot;

== Other styles ==

===Punk jazz===

In the 1990s, another kind of fusion took a more hardcore approach. Bill Laswell produced many albums in this movement, such as &quot;Ask the Ages&quot; by avant-garde guitarist Sonny Sharrock and &quot;Arc of the Testimony&quot; with Laswell&#x27;s band Arcana. Niacin (band) was formed by rock bassist Billy Sheehan, drummer Dennis Chambers, and organist John Novello.

In London, The Pop Group began to mix free jazz and reggae into their form of punk rock. In New York City, no wave was inspired by free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Siam&quot;, James Chance and the Contortions, who mixed soul music with free jazz and punk rock, and the Lounge Lizards, the first group to call themselves punk jazz.

John Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock and incorporated them into free jazz with the release of the &quot;Spy vs Spy&quot; album in 1986. The album was a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes played in the thrashcore style. In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a blend of thrash and free jazz.

===Jazz-funk===

Jazz-funk is characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds, and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&amp;B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.

Jazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club-circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Jazz-funk retains a stronger feel of groove and R&amp;B versus some of the jazz fusion production, and is more arranged and features more improvisation than soul jazz.

===M-Base===
M-Base (&quot;macro-basic array of structured extemporization&quot;) centers on a movement started in the 1980s. It started as a group of young African-American musicians in New York which included Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developing a complex but grooving sound. In the 1990s most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept. M-Base changed from a loose collective to an informal &quot;school&quot;.

===Afro-Cuban jazz===

Afro-Cuban jazz, one of the earliest forms of Latin jazz, is a fusion of Afro-Cuban clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban jazz emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauza and Frank Grillo &quot;Machito&quot; in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. In 1947 the collaborations of bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the congas and the bongos, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as Gillespie&#x27;s and Pozo&#x27;s &quot;Manteca&quot; and Charlie Parker&#x27;s and Machito&#x27;s &quot;Mangó Mangüé&quot;, were commonly referred to as &quot;Cubop&quot;, short for Cuban bebop. During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba.

== Influence on rock music ==

According to bassist Randy Jackson, jazz fusion is a difficult genre to play. &quot;I ... picked jazz fusion because I was trying to become the ultimate technical musician—able to play anything. Jazz fusion to me is the hardest music to play. You have to be so proficient on your instrument. Playing five tempos at the same time, for instance. I wanted to try the toughest music because I knew if I could do that, I could do anything.&quot;

Progressive rock, with its affinity for long solos, diverse influences, non-standard time signatures, and complex music had very similar musical values as jazz fusion. Some prominent examples of progressive rock mixed with elements of fusion is the music of Gong, King Crimson, Ozric Tentacles, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

Jazz rock fusion&#x27;s technically challenging guitar solos, bass solos, and odd-metered, syncopated drumming started to be incorporated in the technically focused progressive metal genre by the late 1980s. Watchtower&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Control and Resistance&quot; is one of the earliest progressive/thrash metal albums to experiment with a jazz fusion-influenced sound. The death metal band Atheist produced albums &quot;Unquestionable Presence&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Elements&quot; in 1993 containing heavily syncopated drumming, changing time signatures, instrumental parts, acoustic interludes, and Latin rhythms. Meshuggah first attracted international attention with the 1995 release &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot; for its fusion of fast-tempo death metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal with jazz fusion elements. Cynic recorded a complex, unorthodox form of jazz fusion influenced experimental death metal with their 1993 album &quot;Focus&quot;. In 1997, Guitar Institute of Technology guitarist Jennifer Batten under the name of Jennifer Batten&#x27;s Tribal Rage: Momentum released &quot;Momentum&quot;—an instrumental hybrid of rock, fusion, and exotic sounds. Mudvayne is heavily influenced by jazz, especially in bassist Ryan Martinie&#x27;s playing. Puya frequently incorporates influences from American and Latin jazz music.

Another, more cerebral, all-instrumental progressive jazz fusion-metal band Planet X released &quot;Universe&quot; in 2000 with Tony MacAlpine, Derek Sherinian (ex-Dream Theater), and Virgil Donati (who has played with Scott Henderson from Tribal Tech). The band blends fusion-style guitar solos and syncopated odd-metered drumming with the heaviness of metal. Tech-prog-fusion metal band Aghora formed in 1995 and released their first album, self-titled &quot;Aghora&quot;, recorded in 1999 with Sean Malone and Sean Reinert, both former members of Cynic. Gordian Knot, another Cynic-linked experimental progressive metal band, released its debut album in 1999 which explored a range of styles from jazz fusion to metal. The Mars Volta is extremely influenced by jazz fusion, using progressive, unexpected turns in the drum patterns and instrumental lines. The style of Uzbek prog band Fromuz is described as &quot;prog fusion&quot;. In lengthy instrumental jams the band transitions from fusion of rock and ambient world music to jazz and progressive hard rock tones.

<text>Ball Boy is a strip in UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot; and also the name of the main character.

==Strip History==

Ball Boy and his comic strip debuted in issue 1,735, dated 18 October 1975 featuring a five-a-side football team who usually lost all their matches. The strip was drawn by Malcolm Judge until his death in 1989. John Dallas took over from him afterwards, and drew it until his retirement in April 2003. The strip was then revamped and taken over by Dave Eastbury. Nigel Parkinson and Tom Paterson both occasionally draw the strip as well. In issue 3,481 (2 May 2009) a John Dallas reprint was used.

For issue 3,260, dated 8 January 2005, the Ball Boy strip was meant to feature a French footballer called Henry Thierry who wore a red shirt. In the strip he is shown a red card and then runs from the team bath when a snorkel appears close to him saying &quot;Time to va-va-voom&quot; – a reference to the Renault adverts in which Thierry Henry appears. The Beano editor Euan Kerr decided to destroy the entire print run of that comic so as not to risk the striker&#x27;s wrath, the issue eventually going on sale with a different Ball Boy strip in its place.

Ball Boy also features in The BeanoMAX comic, drawn in the black and blue vertical striped kit, by Nigel Parkinson. This was explained in a March 2007 Beano. Ball Boy&#x27;s Mum accidentally washed the kits with a blue garment, and it dyed the red stripes dark blue. But the team, who&#x27;d complained they needed new kits, were happy, so BB didn&#x27;t admit what had happened. This strip was drawn by regular artist Dave Eastbury. In 2008, Ball Boy&#x27;s teammates went off on holiday, leaving him needing a new team for a Beanotown Summer League Championship. This team included – Ball Boy, Ronald Osbourne (who has a wealthy mother), Chandra Singh (who is the team&#x27;s most skilled player), Lily, an unnamed goalkeeper and a kid who has hair hidden over his face. They also now have a proper name – &#x27;Beanotown Juniors&#x27;. Ball Boy himself did not score any goals until the final match in this story arc.

From May to August 2009, a number of early 1990s John Dallas strips were reprinted. In September 2009, Dave Eastbury returned as artist.

In July 2013, Ball Boy was taken over by Alexander Matthews who revamped the strip with a new look and a new emphasis on parodying specific incidents in modern football, such as the ownership of Premier League clubs by foreign investors. Between May 2017 and September 2017 Vince Pavey wrote the strip. Danny Pearson took over writing duties in August 2017.

==Characters==

*Ball Boy – the captain of the team. He plays striker for the team. 
*Titch – A small boy who usually plays in defence. He was given his own short strip in The Beano Annual 2002.
*Dimmy – A defender, who is quite dim, hence his name.
*Benjy – A good player on the team, Benjy is Ball Boy&#x27;s best friend.
*Goalie – the goalkeeper. In some strips he is a superb goalkeeper and in others he is comically awful, letting in everything. There are a few strips where he just sits in the corner of the goal, reading, because the rest of the team can&#x27;t get a shot on target.
*Chandra Singh – A midfielder and Ball Boy&#x27;s other best friend.
*Redcardo - Ball Boy&#x27;s arch rival when Alexander Matthews drew the strip
*Sheikh Amassif Bin Bagh - A sheikh who buys Ball Boy&#x27;s football team during Alexander Matthews&#x27; tenure as Ball Boy artist.

==Other Appearances==

* Alongside regular appearances in The Beano, Ball Boy and his team have also been featured frequently in The Beano Annual, BeanoMax and The Beano Comic Library. 
* Robert Harrop featured Ball Boy in their Beano &amp; Dandy figure collection.

<doc id="215019" wikidata="Q492875" url="?curid=215019" title="Continental Divide Trail">
<text>The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (in short Continental Divide Trail, CDT) is a United States National Scenic Trail with a length measured by the Continental Divide Trail Coalition of between the U.S. border with Chihuahua, Mexico and the border with Alberta, Canada. Frequent route changes and a large number of alternate routes result in an actual hiking distance of to . The CDT follows the Continental Divide of the Americas along the Rocky Mountains and traverses five U.S. states — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. In Montana near the Canadian border the trail crosses Triple Divide Pass (near Triple Divide Peak, from which waters may flow to either the Arctic Ocean (via Hudson Bay), Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean).

In 2021, the CDT was about 70 percent complete, with a combination of dedicated trails and dirt and paved roads. Hikers can continue north into Alberta and British Columbia via the Great Divide Trail to Kakwa Lake in Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area, B.C., north of Jasper National Park. 

The CDT was described in 2013 by a Triple Crown hiker as &quot;Raw, wild, remote and unfinished; it is a trail that will make use of all the skills of an experienced backpacker. It is also a trail that is beautiful, stunning and perhaps the most rewarding of the major long-distance hiking trails.&quot; Distances given are approximate as sections of the trail are uncompleted and the trail is sometimes re-routed.

Two-time CDT thru-hiker and professional backpacker, Jeff Garmire, trail name Legend, described the trail by saying, &quot;If you’re into suffering in solitude, the CDT is a perfect match.&quot;

==History==

The establishment of the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail inspired proposals to create a Continental Divide Trail. The first section of the proposed trail was laid out in Colorado in 1962 by the Rocky Mountain Trails Association. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson proposed a national system of trails and in 1968 the U.S. Congress adopted the National Trails System Act. 

In 1978, the Continental Divide Trail was formally established with the responsibility for management given to the U.S. Forest Service. Portions of the trail already existed and a few hikers claimed to have walked from Mexico to Canada on the informal trail, among them Jim Wolf, a Baltimore lawyer who had hiked the Appalachian Trail in 1971, and whose account of that journey appears in the two-volume book, &quot;Hiking the Appalachian Trail.&quot; Wolf envisioned a similar trail running along the Continental Divide, and in 1978, he organized the Continental Divide Trail Society, which advocated for the newly designated National Scenic Trail and published several early guidebooks.

Progress in completing the trail was slow and interest in hiking the complete trail was minimal. By 1995, only 15 people were recorded as having hiked the whole trail, still largely unfinished. In that same year, the Continental Divide Trail Alliance (CDTA) was created and with volunteers built or improved the route of the trail. In 2012, the Continental Divide Trail Coalition replaced the CDTA to coordinate the efforts of several regional partners engaged in constructing and maintaining the trail. Thru-hikers increased from four in 1999 to more than 150 in 2019, and uncounted thousands hiked sections of the trail every year. Horseback riding is permitted on the trail; mountain biking is only permitted on a few sections.

Thru-hikers of the Continental Divide Trail, the Appalachian Trail (AT) and the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) achieve what is known as the Triple Crown of Hiking. As of the end of the application period in late 2021, 525 hikers have been designated Triple Crowners since 1994 by the American Long Distance Hiking Association—West. More than 1,000 thru-hikers completed either the AT or PCT in 2019 compared to 150 completing the CDT, a reflection of the isolation and difficulty in hiking the CDT.

==Thru-hiking==
Successfully thru-hiking the entire Continental Divide Trail takes an average of five months. The definition of a thru-hike is left to the judgment of the hikers. The purists hike a &quot;continuous and unbroken footpath between Mexico and Canada,&quot; but about 50 percent of the thru-hikers admit to having skipped small sections of road-walking or because the trail was closed, mostly due to forest fires or snow. All hikers must replenish their food every few days, often hitchhiking from a road crossing of the trail into a town to buy food and supplies. Most hikers occasionally take a &quot;zero&quot;, a day without hiking, or a &quot;nero&quot;, a day with little hiking, to rest and recuperate. &quot;Trail angels&quot; (volunteers) at locations along the trail assist hikers with food, water, and transportation to and from resupply points to trail heads. A few hikers, especially those attempting to set speed records, are &quot;supported,&quot; meaning they have helpers who meet or accompany them along the trail and perform non-hiking tasks, such as food preparation. Permits are required to hike or camp along some sections of the trail and a passport is needed to cross the Canadian border.

Most thru-hikers begin the hike in April in New Mexico, hike northbound, and finish at the Canadian border in August or September. If hikers begin too early they may encounter heavy and near impassable snow conditions in the southern San Juan and San Juan Mountains of Colorado, and if the hiker finishes too late they may encounter heavy and near impassable snow in Glacier National Park near the Canadian border. A few thru-hikers hike southbound (SOBO) from the Canadian border beginning in June and finishing in October or November. They may also encounter adverse weather conditions. A few hikers &quot;flip-flop,&quot; hiking different sections of the trail when the weather is most favorable rather than sequentially. The most common problems reported by thru-hikers are injury and snow. The average base weight of a thru-hiker&#x27;s backpack in 2018 was . Added to that, the thru-hiker carries up to a one-week supply of food weighing about per day and, in drier areas especially New Mexico, up to five liters of water weighing . Extra equipment carried might include an ice ax and bear spray. 

In 2019, the respondents to a survey of CDT thru-hikers were two-thirds male with a median age of 31. Three-quarters were from the United States and the remainder came from eleven other countries. The average number of days (including &quot;zeros&quot;) to complete the hike was 147.

Although there are earlier claimants, Dave Odell is the first hiker officially credited with completing the still-undefined CDT in 1977. In 1978 three women hiked the entire trail: Nancy Andujar and the team of Jean Ella and Lynne Wisegart. In 2007, Francis Tapon became the first person to do a round backpacking trip &quot;yo-yo&quot; on the Continental Divide Trail when he through-hiked from Mexico to Canada and back to Mexico on the CDT. This seven-month journey spanned over 5,600 miles. Tapon took the most circuitous, scenic, high, difficult route north and while returning south, took the more expedient route. Andrew Skurka completed the trail as part of the 6,875-mile Great Western Loop in 2007. Olive &quot;Raindance&quot; McGloin, yo-yoed in 2020 becoming the first woman on her second attempt (McGloin also yo-yoed the PCT in 2014).

The youngest person to thru-hike the trail is Reed Gjonnes, who hiked the trail with her father Eric Gjonnes from April 15, 2013 to September 6, 2013 in one continuous northbound hike at age 13.

==Route==
The Continental Divide Trail closely follows the Continental Divide, but has a large number of approved alternate routes, some of which are more utilized than the official trail. The trail is incomplete in a few sections, especially in New Mexico, which requires walking on roads. Ninety-five percent of the trail is located on public land, including National Parks, National Forests, and land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. There are few facilities along the trail itself, and it is usually necessary for the hiker to leave the trail to resupply or find lodging.

Seventy percent (2,170 miles) of the trail is through land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The Bureau of Land Management manages 12% or 372 miles of the trail, the National Park Service manages 10% or 310 miles, and state and private lands total 8% or 248 miles.

===New Mexico===

 Forest fires are a danger to hikers. Sections of the trail are often closed to hikers because of fire danger. In 2022, for example, more than 300 miles of the CDT were closed for one month due to drought conditions causing fire hazards.

The official route of the CDT in New Mexico is long, although many alternate routes shorten or lengthen that distance. The lowest elevation of the trail in New Mexico is in the town of Lordsburg and the highest elevation in New Mexico is at the summit of Mount Taylor. Much of the CDT route in New Mexico traverses desert and dry mountains. Finding drinking water is a challenge for hikers. 

Three southern termini of the trail exist: 1) Crazy Cook Monument, the official CDT southern terminus, east of the Big Hatchet Mountains; 2) Antelope Wells, New Mexico; and 3) near Columbus, New Mexico. The Crazy Cook Monument in New Mexico&#x27;s bootheel is the most commonly used starting or finishing point of the CDT, but due to its remote location lacks lodging and other services. In northernmost New Mexico, the CDT crosses into Colorado near Cumbres Pass at an elevation of . The trail is unfinished and many miles of the hike require road walking.&lt;ref name=&quot;about/newmexico&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable points on the CDT in New Mexico from south to north include: 
*Crazy Cook Monument. The CDT begins here at the border with Mexico at an elevation of and is accessed only by a dirt road. 
*Animas and Playas Valleys. In the Chihuahua Desert water is scarce and the trail route is mostly informal. 
*Big Burro Mountains. The first wooded areas on the CDT for the north-bound hiker. 
*Silver City, New Mexico. The CDT passes through the town, a rest and resupply center. 
*Gila Wilderness. Ninety-five percent of thru-hikers take the Gila River alternate trail which goes through the scenic canyon of the river. Voted third among favorite sections of the CDT by hikers in 2019. 
*Pie Town. A hiker and biker-friendly hamlet on the trail with a hostel (the &quot;Toaster House&quot;) supported by hiker&#x27;s donations and a restaurant which serves pie. 
*El Malpaís National Monument. Most hikers take a shorter alternate route by-passing many of the lava fields of El Malpais. 
*Grants, New Mexico. A rest and resupply center. The CDT crosses Interstate 40 here. 
*Mount Taylor. Most thru-hikers summit Mount Taylor, the highest point on the CDT in New Mexico. 
*San Pedro Parks Wilderness. North bound hikers find here the first sizeable accumulations of snow on the trail until about 1 June at elevations of more than . 
*Ghost Ranch. A retreat and education center, the former home of artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, and a popular site for filming Western movies. 
*Chama, New Mexico. A resupply center and near the beginning of the long and difficult hike through the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado.

===Colorado===

The official route of the CDT in Colorado is long, although several alternate routes shorten or lengthen that distance. The lowest elevation of the trail in Colorado is along the Middle Fork of the Elk River near the border with Wyoming and the highest elevation in Colorado is at the summit of Gray&#x27;s Peak. Several additional mountains with elevations of more than are near the trail

Colorado was voted the most difficult state for thru-hikers by 81.2 percent of 235 respondents in a 2022 survey. The CDT traverses many of the highest and wildest mountain ranges of Colorado, frequently at elevations near or above which is about in southern Colorado and in northern Colorado. In most areas the CDT is well marked. It is concurrent with the Colorado Trail for approximately . Mountain bikes are allowed on parts of the Colorado Trail. Depending on any given year&#x27;s snow-pack and a hiker&#x27;s individual schedule, alternative routes are available. Forest fires often result in parts of the trail being closed and the hiker must take alternative routes. Another hazard to hikers is Colorado&#x27;s &#x27;monsoon season&#x27; with violent afternoon thunderstorms that are common in July and August on high mountain ridges

Notable points on the CDT in Colorado from south to north include:

* Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. The CDT crosses the narrow-gauge heritage railroad inside Colorado.
* South San Juan Wilderness. The hiker entering the southern San Juan Mountains until mid-June often finds nearly impassable snow-packs and hazardous conditions. Many take a lower and less difficult route. 
* Wolf Creek Pass. The CDT crosses U.S. Highway 160 near a ski area. 
* Creede cut off. Due to snow or forest fires in the San Juan Mountains many hikers choose to take this lower and shorter route which follows the Rio Grande River through Creede and rejoins the main CDT at Spring Creek Pass
* San Juan Mountains and Weminuche Wilderness. The CDT follows high ridgelines at elevations of more than . In a 2019 survey, the San Juans were voted fourth among favorite sections of the CDT. Snow can be a major problem for hikers, requiring alternate routes, until late June and again in October. 
* Salida. In a 2019 survey, Salida was voted the most popular resupply town near the CDT. 
* Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. Mount Harvard, Mount Yale, Mount Princeton, Mount Columbia and Mount Oxford, all more than in elevation, are near the CDT. 
* Twin Lakes. At mile number 369 in Colorado for north-bound hikers, Twin Lakes is the first town in Colorado located on the CDT and is a rest and resupply center. 
* Mount Elbert and Mount Massive. Colorado&#x27;s highest peaks are near the CDT.
* Grays Peak. The highest summit on the CDT has an elevation of 
* Grand Lake. The CDT follows the shorelines of Lake Granby, Shadow Mountain Lake, and Grand Lake to the rest and resupply village of Grand Lake. 
* Rocky Mountain National Park. The CDT passes through a corner of the park. Numerous side trails lead to other locations. 
* Parkview Mountain. The peak is the most northern place where the CDT reaches an elevation of (although peaks near the trail in Wyoming exceed that elevation). The trail to the summit is the steepest mile on the official CDT, a climb in . (Some approach and alternate trails of the CDT are steeper.)
* Elk River. The lowest elevation of the CDT in Colorado is near the border with Wyoming

===Wyoming===
The official route of the CDT in Wyoming is long, although several alternate routes shorten or lengthen that distance. The lowest elevation of the trail in Wyoming is about north of Rawlins. and the highest elevation in Wyoming is at Lester Pass in the Bridger Wilderness of the Wind River Range.

The Rocky Mountains of Colorado terminate in southern Wyoming and the CDT passes through a long section of desert range-land in the middle of the state, known as the Great Divide Basin. Hikers must decide on a route through the Great Divide Basin as the actual Continental Divide forks, forming an endorheic basin. The shortest route is through the middle where water availability is uncertain in most years. Leaving the Basin, the CDT traverses the remote and rugged &#x27;bench&#x27; of the Wind River Range, climbing to above timberline which is about in this area, and then through the Absaroka Range in the northwest portion of the state. The grand finale of the CDT in Wyoming is Yellowstone National Park. The trail exits west to Idaho. Grizzly bears become a possible danger from the Wind River Range northward, especially in and near Yellowstone Park.

Notable points in Wyoming on the CDT from south to north include:

* Bridger Peak. At the last major summit of the Rocky Mountains before descending into the Red Desert. 
* Rawlins. The CDT passes through this resupply center and crosses Interstate 80. 
* Great Divide Basin. For more than 100 miles from Rawlins to the Wind River Range, the CDT runs through the gently-rolling, water-scarce Red Desert. 
* South Pass. The Oregon Trail, the California Trail and the Mormon Trail traversed this area in the 19th century. 
* Wind River Range. More than of the CDT runs along the flanks of the rugged Winds, voted in 2019 the favorite section of the CDT. Wilderness areas comprise of roadless land dotted with lakes, glaciers and peaks rising near the trail to a maximum of 
* Cirque of the Towers. from the CDT, regarded as the most scenic vista of the Wind River Range.
* Lester Pass. At an elevation of , the highest point reached by the CDT in Wyoming. 
* Teton Wilderness. Near the CDT is the most remote place in the contiguous United States, from the nearest road.
* Yellowstone Park. Traversing the southern part of the Park, the CDT passes by Old Faithful and numerous other geysers and hot springs.

===Idaho/Montana border===
Northbounders leaving Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming enter the Centennial Mountains of Idaho. For the next the trail closely follows the border of Idaho and Montana, which is also the Continental Divide. The lowest elevation of the trail on the Idaho/Montana border is along the North Fork of Sheep Creek in Idaho and the highest elevation is at the summit of Elk Mountain. Timberline along this section of the trail is to in elevation. Much of the CDT follows high, grassy ridges with some walking on dirt roads required. Water can be scarce and grizzly bears are found near Yellowstone Park.

Notable points on the CDT from south to north along the Idaho/Montana border include:
* Targhee Peak. The peak is near the CDT and has an elevation of . 
* Interstate 15. The CDT crosses the highway at an elevation of . 
* Lemhi Pass. In 1805, Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed this pass.
* Elk Mountain. The CDT achieves an elevation of , the most northerly place on the trail to reach an elevation of more than . 
* Homer Young&#x27;s Peak. The peak, near the CDT, is the highest along this section of the CDT with an elevation of . 
* North Fork of Sheep Creek. The CDT drops from the Continental Divide to the lowest point on the Idaho/Montana trail, . 
* Chief Joseph Pass. Chief Joseph and the Nez Percé people, pursued by the U.S. Cavalry, crossed from Idaho into Montana near this pass in 1877 during their flight toward Canada.

===Montana===

Leaving the Idaho/Montana border, the Montana portion of the CDT is in length although several alternate routes shorten or lengthen that distance. The lowest elevation of the trail in Montana after leaving the Idaho/Montana border is at Upper Waterton Lake which straddles the U.S./Canada border. The highest elevation is in the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness. Timberline can be as low as in Glacier National Park at the Canadian border and as high as in the southern part of Montana. The Montana Wilderness Association is the leading non-profit partner for the northern section of the CDT. MWA staff work to maintain the CDT in Montana and Idaho with the help of volunteers and agency partners.

The CDT trail goes east from the Idaho border, circles around the city of Butte, then turns north toward Glacier National Park via the Lewis and Clark National Forest and through three National Wilderness areas. Several alternate trails shorten the meandering route of the official CDT in Montana. Some road walking is required on the alternate routes. Frequent forest fires in late summer often force closure of sections of the trail and early snowfalls in late September may make the trail in Glacier National Park impassable.

Notable points from south to north on the CDT in Montana include:
* Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness. West Goat Peak, , is the highest point near the trail in Montana.
* Anaconda cutoff. Most thru-hikers take this alternate route, which is shorter than the official CDT and passes through the town of Anaconda. 
* Interstate 15. The CDT crosses the highway at an elevation of . 
* Interstate 90. The CDT crosses the highway at an elevation of . 
* Interstate 15. The CDT crosses Interstate 15 again at an elevation of . 
* Bob Marshall Wilderness complex. Most of the between the CDT crossings of Highways 200 and 2 are in the Scapegoat, &quot;The Bob,&quot; and Great Bear wilderness areas The only resupply point near the CDT is the Benchmark Wilderness Ranch, north of Highway 200. 
* Chinese Wall. In the Bob Marshall Wilderness the limestone cliffs of the Chinese Wall rise above the CDT for .
* East Glacier Park Village. At the entrance of Glacier National Park, the CDT is routed through the village and hikers resupply here for long treks whether going north or south. 
* Glacier National Park. The park was voted second among favorite sections of the CDT by hikers in 2019. The trails in the park are well-maintained and sometimes crowded. Grizzly bears are present. Due to snow in late September north-bound thru-hikers may take alternate routes to reach the Canadian border by road walking. 
* Waterton Park. The village, four miles inside Canada in Waterton Lakes National Park, is the official starting and ending point of the CDT.

<text>A teapot is a vessel used for steeping tea leaves or a herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water and serving the resulting infusion called tea. It is one of the core components of teaware.

Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top, where the dry tea and hot water are added, a handle for holding by hand, and a spout through which the tea is served. Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout. A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured. In modern times, a thermally insulating cover called a tea cosy may be used to enhance the steeping process or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly.

Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea, in which case a tea infuser or tea strainer may be of some assistance, either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured.

==History==
=== China ===
The switch to specialized vessels for tea brewing was powered by the change from powdered tea to leaf tea and from whipping to steeping in China. It is hard to pinpoint the time of the invention of the teapot since vessels in shapes similar to the modern teapot were known in China since the Neolithic period but were initially used for water and wine, as boiling or whipping tea did not require a specialized container. When tea preparation switched to infusion (during the late Yuan dynasty), an ewer-like vessel was first used. Tea preparation during previous dynasties did not use a teapot.

In the Tang dynasty, a cauldron was used to boil ground tea and serve it in bowls. Song dynasty tea was made by boiling water in a kettle and then pouring the water into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan dynasty text &quot;Jiyuan Conghua&quot;, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming dynasty, teapots were widespread in China. There are early examples of teapots, like the ones made in Jun ware and the eight-lobed celadon pots of the Song-Yuan times. Still, an expert on Yixing ware, Kuei-Hsiang Lo, believes that the first teapots made especially for tea appeared around 1500 as copies of much earlier Yixing wine pots. The earliest example of such a teapot that has survived to this day seems to be the one in the Flagstaff House Museum of Teaware; it has been dated to 1513 and is attributed to Gong Chun, the &quot;father of Yixing teapot&quot;.

Early teapots, like those still used in modern Gongfu tea ceremonies, were small by Western standards meant for individual tea consumption. They use a higher ratio of leaves to water, which enables the brewer to control the brewing variables to create several small infusions. After brewing, tea would be decanted into a separate vessel, distributed into the small cups of several drinkers, and brewed again. This allows the tea to be brewed skillfully and allows the flavor changes to be experienced through the various infusions.

Teapots made from pottery materials such as clay have been hand-fired for tens of thousands of years, originally in China. Clay is a popular material for teapots, as they tend to retain heat very well.

Many traditional Chinese teaware are Yixing ware. Yixing and other regional clays are left unglazed. This allows the clay to absorb the flavor of the teas brewed over time and enhance the taste of the tea going forward. Some Gongfu practitioners designate their unglazed pots for specific types, sometimes even particular tea varietals.

From the end of the 17th century, tea was shipped from China to Europe as part of the export of exotic spices and luxury goods. The ships that brought the tea also carried porcelain teapots.
The majority of these teapots were painted in blue and white underglaze.
Porcelain, being completely vitrified, will withstand sea water without damage, so the teapots were packed below deck whilst the tea was stowed above deck to ensure that it remained dry.

=== Japan ===

The &quot;kyūsu&quot; (急須), a common and traditional teapot in Japan, differs from the Chinese teapot in that it has a handle facing sideways to the spout. However, some &quot;kyūsu&quot;, like their Chinese counterparts, have the handle opposite the spout. &quot;Kyūsu&quot; is frequently made of ceramics.

The &quot;kyūsu&quot; has its origins in a Chinese tool used for tea ceremonies. Although the Chinese tool may have been used to boil water, it is unclear if it was used to steep tea back then. In Japan, &quot;kyūsu&quot; has been used since at least the 18th century.

The side arrangement of the handle is considered unique to Japan. However, the same feature can be found in some Chinese tools mentioned above.

=== Morocco ===
In Morocco, stainless steel teapots are essential for making Moroccan mint tea. Moroccan teapots are heat-resistant and can be put directly on the stove. Colorful tea glasses are part of the Moroccan tea ritual. The tea is considered drinkable only when it has foam on top. Teapots have a long curved spout to pour tea from a height of around above the glasses, which produces foam on the surface of the tea. Their designs can range from simple to heavily decorated.

=== Tibet ===
Teapots for butter tea in Tibet evolved simultaneously with teapots in China, eventually settling on a pitcher-like shape.

=== Europe ===
The Yixing teapots came to Europe with the tea and became known as &quot;boccaro&quot; (&quot;large mouth&quot; in Portuguese). The Chinese teapot models were used since preserving the Chinese way of drinking was considered essential. The first known order for teapots &quot;with covers and handles&quot; dates back to 1639. Porcelain teapots were particularly desirable because porcelain could not be made in Europe back then, and tea drinking in Europe was initially the preserve of the upper classes. European teapots at the time were made of silver, with the earliest preserved English one at the Victoria and Albert Museum, dated 1670, looking identical to the earlier coffee pots. They can be identified as teapots only through an inscription. At the same time, copies of the Chinese earthenware teapots were produced (Fulham Pottery in London had already been manufacturing these in 1670). It was not until 1708 that the first successful experiments by von Tschirnhaus enabled Böttger and the Meissen factory in Dresden to start the operation in 1710 and produce good copies of Japanese Kakiemon and Imari porcelain.

When European potteries in Holland, Germany, and England began making tea wares, they initially imitated the Chinese &quot;boccaro&quot; designs. However, many English potteries decided not to risk money on the new material and continued manufacturing earthenware and stoneware pots; the famed creamware services made in Staffordshire reached popularity in the second half of the 18th century.

At the turn of the 18th century, the design and decoration of the European teapot started to deviate from the Chinese tradition, with the pear shape, or , being the first major novation. An early English pyriform teapot dates back to 1690. The shape became widespread at the time of Queen Anne and has remained in vogue since then. The other popular shapes in the 18th century were &quot;globular&quot; (sphere-like vessel on a raised foot) and a vase (or urn, Louis XV style), with the latter being a rare comeback to the wine-pot origins of a teapot.

In the last half of the 18th century, English factories introduced the matched sets of teaware. The original demand for &quot;China&quot; porcelain tea sets was eventually replaced, at least among the wealthy, with enthusiasm for silver pieces that were produced extensively by the end of the reign of George III. This period also saw a reduction in the price of tea, so teapots became larger. Also, cheaper pewter sets were made for the less affluent, mostly as simplified copies of the silver pieces.

=== America ===
In colonial America, Boston became the epicenter for silver production and artistry. Among the many artists in Boston, there were four major families in the city&#x27;s silver market: Edwards, Revere, Burt, and Hurd. Their works of art included silver teapots. Two new &quot;colonial&quot; shapes appeared in the late Georgian era: oval and octagonal teapots with flat bases, plain handles in the shape of C, and, frequently, straight tapering spouts.

== Heat retention ==
The ability of a teapot to keep heat depends on the material. For example, stoneware is supposed to keep the heat better than porcelain.
To keep teapots hot after the tea is first brewed, English households since the 18th century employed the tea cosy, a padded fabric covering, much like a hat, that slips over the teapot. The tea cosy became very popular in the 20th century as a practical and decorative object in the kitchen.

== Features ==
Teapots evolved from the designs where the lid was resting in a recess of the body of the vessel to the lid sitting on top of the body, and then to the modern design with the deep flanges of the lid preventing it from falling out.

When the tea is poured out, outside air needs to enter the teapot&#x27;s body; therefore, the design involves either a loosely fitting lid or a vent hole at the top of the pot, usually in the lid.

The built-in strainer at the base of the spout was borrowed from coffeepots that, in turn, get this feature from the vessels designed for other liquids (the earliest known built-in strainer dates back to 1300 BC).

The coffee drip brew and coffee percolator were invented at the beginning of the 19th century, and similar designs for tea were developed soon after that.

Modern infusers originated in 1817 when an English patent was granted for a &quot;tea or coffee biggin&quot;, a metal basket at the bottom of the teapot. Many more tea leaf holder designs followed, with tea balls and tea-making spoons arriving in the first half of the 19th century.

The first automated electric teapot was invented in 1909.

== Materials ==
The typical materials used for teapots have been stoneware (Yixing), porcelain, silver, and gold.

Making teapots from silver has a major disadvantage: the thermal conductivity of silver is the highest of any metal. Therefore, the handles of antique silver teapots were often made of wood (often apple-wood or pear-wood) or ivory. If the handles were made from silver, they would be attached to the pot&#x27;s body with thermally insulating plugs, usually made from ivory. Without such features, the teapot would be uncomfortable or painful to pick up when filled with hot tea.

Teapots made of tin arrived around 1700, allowing for very low-cost designs. At the same time, the use of Britannia ware had started. Nickel plating was introduced in the second half of the 19th century. Teapots from earthenware were produced in Staffordshire from 1720 to 1780, with curious shapes (animals, houses, etc.) made possible using molds (and not the throwing wheel). Enamelware was in wide use at the end of the 19th century.

In the 20th century, the use of aluminum became popular. The arrival of the heatproof glass made a glass teapot possible, with the first &quot;Teaket&quot; design manufactured in 1932.

=== Replacement handles ===
The early European teapots frequently had wooden handle replacements made from pear, hornbeam, and sycamore, either stained or ebonized (sometimes even made from ebony), connected to the pot&#x27;s body using metal sockets. The use of wood to repair a broken ceramic handle started soon after the introduction of tea to Europe: the vessels were expensive and were not thrown away once damaged. To underscore the preciousness of the repaired teapot, the sockets were occasionally made from gilt silver.

== Dribbling ==

One phenomenon with some teapots is dribbling, where the flow runs down the outside of the spout, particularly as the flow starts or stops. Different explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed at various times. Making the external surface of the spout more hydrophobic and reducing the radius of curvature of the inside of the tip so that the flow detaches cleanly can avoid dribbling.

==In non-teamaking contexts==
A teapot has a rather distinctive shape, and its fame may sometimes have little to do with its primary function.
*The Utah Teapot is a standard reference object of the computer graphics community, comparable to Hello, World for its popularity. It is included as a graphics primitive in many graphics packages, including AutoCAD, POV-Ray, OpenGL, Direct3D, and 3ds Max.
*Russell&#x27;s teapot is an analogy devised by Bertrand Russell, which attacks the unfalsifiability of religious claims, comparing them to the eponymous teapot. The concept inspired the title of the 1973 album &quot;Flying Teapot&quot; by the Franco-British rock band Gong.
*The teapot has been featured in the American children&#x27;s song from 1939, &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Teapot&quot;.
*In Korea, the teapot is commonly used as a serving container for various types of wines.
*Part of the constellation of Sagittarius contains an asterism (or a star pattern not officially recognized as a constellation) that famously resembles a teapot.
*The &#x27;Teapot Game&#x27; is a word game described by Mary White&#x27;s &quot;Book of Games&quot; and involves guessing a word replaced by &quot;teapot&quot; in various sentences.
*&quot;The Teapot&quot; is a tale by Hans Christian Andersen.

===In architecture===
* In 2004, a Malaysian cult called the Sky Kingdom constructed a 35-foot-tall, cream-colored teapot with an unusually long spout, higher than the pot itself on its property as part of its private symbolism, which included a similarly large blue vase next to the teapot. As part of a crackdown on the sect in August 2005, bulldozers and heavy machinery were sent to tear down the structure.
* The (purported) world&#x27;s largest architectural teapot is in West Virginia. In 1938, the Chester teapot was constructed by William &quot;Babe&quot; Devon. It started as a gigantic wooden hogshead barrel for a Hires Root Beer advertising campaign. Devon purchased the barrel in Pennsylvania and shipped it to Chester, West Virginia, where it was set up at the junction of State Route 2 and U.S. Route 30. A spout and handle were added, and the wooden barrel was covered with tin to shape the teapot. A large glass ball was placed on top to make the knob of the &quot;lid&quot;. It stood in front of Devon&#x27;s pottery outlet store. Local teenagers were hired to run a concession and souvenir stand inside it.
* The Teapot Dome Service Station is located in Zillah, Washington. It was built in 1922, and the 15-foot handled-and-spouted gas station was designed as a visual pun referencing the then-current Teapot Dome scandal. It has been moved multiple times and is no longer an active gas station.

<text>Mike Fink (also spelled Miche Phinck) (c. 1770/1780 – c. 1823), called &quot;king of the keelboaters&quot;, was a semi-legendary and river boatman who exemplified the tough and hard-drinking men who ran keelboats up and down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.

==Historical figure==
Mike Fink was born at Fort Pitt in present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and served as an Indian scout in his teenage years. Even as a teenager, he was an unbeatable marksman, and he earned the name &quot;Bangall&quot; among militiamen at Fort Pitt. When the Indian wars of the region ended in the mid 1790s, Fink, like many other scouts, spurned a sedentary life as a farmer. Instead, he drifted into the transport business on the Ohio and Mississippiand quickly picked up a new nickname: &quot;the snapping turtle&quot;.

When he began his career in navigation, he became notorious, both for his practical jokes and for his willingness to fight anyone who was not amused. His 180-pound frame stretched 6&#x27;3&quot; in height, and the muscles required to force a keelboat upstream would have made him a formidable opponent to most. It was said that he could drink a gallon of whisky and still shoot the tail off a pig at 90 paces, and Fink himself proclaimed on every possible occasion that he could &quot;out-run, out-hop, out-jump, throw-down, drag out, and lick any man in the country&quot;.

He and his friends were supposed to have amused themselves by shooting cups of whiskey from each other&#x27;s heads. Other repeating episodes of the Mike Fink legends include a tale where he shoots the scalp lock from the head of an Indian and a story in which he shoots with surgical precision the protruding heel from the foot of an African-American slave. Hauled into court, he pointed out to a judge that his victim would never have been able to wear a fashionable boot if a good Samaritan, namely himself, had not intervened on the man&#x27;s behalf.

Besides imagined feats making part of the legend of Mike Fink, it may have also been woven from two (or more) men with the same name. Mike Fink signed up as one of Ashley&#x27;s Hundred and formed a part of the band that built Fort Henry. If this man had been the one born at Fort Pitt about 1770, he would have been at least 50 years old. Such an advanced age in that group of teenage boys would have been remarked on. Hugh Glass, the mountain man who survived a grizzly bear mauling, was called &quot;Old Hugh&quot;, for being in his early 40s. No journal mentions Fink&#x27;s advanced age, so it may have been a younger Mike Fink who joined the expedition of the Ashley Rocky Mountain Fur Company.

Davy Crockett is supposed to have described him as &quot;half horse and half alligator.&quot; Fink wore a red feather in his cap to signal his defeat of every strong man up and down the river.

Henry Howe&#x27;s &quot;Historical Collections of Ohio&quot; contained an 1806 (1886?) interview with Capt. John Fink, who said that Mike Fink was a relative.

When I was a lad,&quot; John told me, &quot;about ten years of age, our family lived four miles up river from Wheeling, on the river. Mike laid up (landed) his boat near us, though he generally had two boats. This was his last trip, and he went away to the far West; the country there was getting too civilized, and he was disgusted with progress. This was about 1815.

In the management of his business Mike Fink was a rigid disciplinarian; woe to the man who shirked his responsibilities or did not carry his own weightliterally. He always had his woman along with him and would allow no other man to speak with her. She was sometimes a subject for his wonderful skill in marksmanship with the rifle. He would have her hold on the top of her head a tin cup filled with whiskey, which he would put a bullet through. Another of his feats was to have her hold it between her knees, as in a vise, and then shoot.

According to the Miami Valley Historical Society, (specifically, &quot;Miami Valley Vignettes&quot; by George C. Crout), until 1815, when he moved west. Mike Fink did not operate keel boats on the Ohio but on the Great Miami River from the Ohio River to Fort Loramie, where portage was made to the Maumee River in order to continue going on up to Lake Erie.

If it was indeed he who joined Ashley&#x27;s Hundred, Fink died in the Rocky Mountains in 1823 during the course of Ashley&#x27;s expedition. Some say it was a drunken argument over what he always called a &quot;chère amie&quot;a romantic interest. Timothy Field in 1829 said that in a drunken stupor, when aiming at a mug of beer from the head of his longtime friend, a companion named Carpenter, he shot low; shortly thereafter, his other longtime friend, Talbot, retaliated by killing Fink, using Carpenter&#x27;s pistol.

==In popular culture==
The recorded exploits of Mike Fink featured mostly in American broadside ballads, dime novels, and other subliterary texts from before the Civil War era. The first known reference to the character is in an 1821 farce, &quot;The Pedlar&quot; by Alphonso Wetmore. Here, Fink appears as the stereotypical bully and braggart. He appears frequently in stories involving the Davy Crockett cycle, but Fink lacked Crockett&#x27;s more admirable traits.

Over time, the unlikeable features of the character came even more to the forefront, and Fink was portrayed increasingly as a bully who got his comeuppance. After the Civil War, the character began to be neglected; the mood of Americans disinclined them to admire a bumptious and violent folk hero. In the early 20th century, there was an attempt to revive his popularity, spearheaded by Colonel Henry Shoemaker, a Pennsylvania folklorist, who collected Mike Fink tales, and saw the character as a local equivalent to Crockett, but Shoemaker&#x27;s attempt at reviving the character sputtered.

In 1955, Mike Fink (as portrayed by character actor Jeff York) appeared in two episodes of the &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; miniseries of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Disneyland&quot; opposite the popular Davy Crockett (portrayed by Fess Parker). These episodes were later compiled into a feature film entitled &quot;Davy Crockett and the River Pirates&quot;, released in 1956. Elements of the Fink legend were present in Walt Disney&#x27;s rendition, but the character was played mostly for laughs as a foil for the infallible Crockett. Keel boats bearing Fink&#x27;s name, Mike Fink Keel Boats, operated at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Liberty Square until they were quietly retired in the late 1990s, when one unexpectedly capsized and dumped guests and cast members into the river.

In 1958, Zachary Ball, known as an author who wrote adventure stories for boys, wrote a fictional account of the early life of Mike Fink entitled &quot;Young Mike Fink&quot;. Similar to Disney&#x27;s portrayal of Fink, Ball&#x27;s title character is good natured and helpful despite his sometimes hooligan and contrary temperament.

Mike Fink also appears in Eudora Welty&#x27;s parodic fairy-tale &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot;.

In Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot;, an alternate version of Mike Fink appears in every novel after the first. Unlike other significant characters, he has no magical knack, but, prior to meeting Alvin, he was made invincible by means of a tattoo given to him at birth (similar to Achilles). In the books, his invulnerability is what made him a bully; having no conception of pain, he could not appreciate the effects of his actions (&quot;Prentice Alvin&quot;). In &quot;Alvin Journeyman&quot;, he resurfaces, grateful to Alvin for both sparing his life and teaching him the folly of his previous life of violence.

Mike Fink is played by Forrest Tucker in the 1977 made for TV film &quot;The Incredible Rocky Mountain Race&quot;, in which Fink is pitted in a rivalry against Mississippi riverboater and future author Mark Twain in a cross-country scavenger hunt, although the real-life Twain was born twelve years after Fink&#x27;s death. Much of the story and its humor is culled from Twain&#x27;s various works.

In 1998, children&#x27;s author Steven Kellogg, wrote a book entitled &quot;Mike Fink: A Tall Tale&quot;. As in his other books, Kellogg&#x27;s account of Fink incorporates tall tales with vivid illustrations – highlighting the main character&#x27;s positive side.

Mike Fink is a prime character in the 2007 young-adult historical novel &quot;Mississippi Jack&quot; by Louis A. Meyer. In it, Fink is outwitted by the main character of the book series. He is portrayed as a large, hairy, loud man who constantly boasts about his many feats in life. He is first met while traveling down the Allegheny River and is later seen in Pittsburgh, where he is put in jail for fighting.

On the Ohio River in Cincinnati, OH and Covington, KY, a riverboat restaurant called Mike Fink&#x27;s was a popular attraction for over 40 years. It specialized in fresh seafood and had a large raw bar in the center of the boat. It closed in 2008 and was moved in 2014 to Newport, KY, with the hope it would be renovated and reopened. However, the boat ended up as a shop barge in 2019.

Mike Fink also appears in &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as an enemy.

There are some tall tales that mention he had a daughter named Sal Fink, who was said to be equally daring and known for her holler.

<doc id="215027" wikidata="Q270098" url="?curid=215027" title="Eastern grey kangaroo">
<text>The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a marsupial found in the eastern third of Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the great grey kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern grey male can typically weigh up to and have a length of well over , the scientific name, &quot;Macropus giganteus&quot; (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the red kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to .

==Taxonomy==
The eastern grey kangaroo was described by George Shaw in 1790 as &quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;.

===Subspecies===
While two subspecies were recognised by Mammal Species of the World (MSW), there is some dispute as to the validity of this division, and the subspecies are not recognised by the Australian Mammal Society, the IUCN, or the American Society of Mammalogists, which produces the successor of the MSW. Albert Sherbourne Le Souef created the Tasmanian subspecies in 1923, based on coat colour. In 1972 Kirsch and Poole published a paper supporting the concept of separate species for the eastern and western greys, but casting doubt on the subspecies &quot;M. g. tasmaniensis&quot;, as
...these subspecies, or species as Le Souef (1923) would have it in the case of the Tasmanian forester, are based on so little study of so little material that we do not believe that they should be recognized as such at this time. 
A later study published in 2003 was also critical of the division, stating that 
Phylogenetic comparisons between &quot;M. g. giganteus&quot; and &quot;M. g. tasmaniensis&quot; indicated that the current taxonomic status of these subspecies should be revised as there was a lack of genetic differentiation between the populations sampled.&quot;

The subspecies recognised by Mammal Species of the World were:
*&quot;Macropus giganteus giganteus&quot;found in eastern and central Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and southeastern South Australia
*&quot;Macropus giganteus tasmaniensis&quot;(commonly known as the forester kangaroo) endemic to Tasmania

==Description==


The eastern grey kangaroo is the second largest and heaviest living marsupial and native land mammal in Australia. An adult male will commonly weigh around whereas females commonly weigh around . They have a powerful tail that is over long in adult males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green-Barber/Old 2018 blood&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Large males of this species are more heavily built and muscled than the lankier red kangaroo and can occasionally exceed normal dimensions. One of these, shot in eastern Tasmania weighed , with a total length from nose to tail (possibly along the curves). The largest known specimen, examined by Lydekker, had a weight of and measured along the curves. When the skin of this specimen was measured it had a &quot;flat&quot; length of .

The eastern grey is easy to recognise: its soft grey coat is distinctive, and it is usually found in moister, more fertile areas than the red. Red kangaroos, though sometimes grey-blue in colour, have a totally different face than eastern grey kangaroos. Red kangaroos have distinctive markings in black and white beside their muzzles and along the sides of their face. Eastern grey kangaroos do not have these markings, and their eyes seem large and wide open.

Where their ranges overlap, it is much more difficult to distinguish between eastern grey and western grey kangaroos, which are closely related. They have a very similar body and facial structure, and their muzzles are fully covered with fine hair (though that is not obvious at a distance, their noses do look noticeably different from the noses of reds and wallaroos). The eastern grey&#x27;s colouration is a light-coloured grey or brownish-grey, with a lighter silver or cream, sometimes nearly white, belly. The western grey is a dark dusty brown colour, with more contrast especially around the head. Indigenous Australian names include &quot;iyirrbir&quot; (Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola) and &quot;kucha&quot; (Pakanh). The highest ever recorded speed of any kangaroo was set by a large female eastern grey kangaroo.

==Distribution and habitat==
Although the red is better known, the eastern grey is the kangaroo most often encountered in Australia, due to its adaptability. Few Australians visit the arid interior of the continent, while many live in and around the major cities of the southern and eastern coast, from where it is usually only a short drive to the remaining pockets of near-city bushland where kangaroos can be found without much difficulty. The eastern grey prefers open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter and mainly inhabits the wetter parts of Australia. It also inhabits coastal areas, woodlands, sub-tropical forests, mountain forests, and inland scrubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frith/Calaby 1969&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
Like all kangaroos, it is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, and is mostly seen early in the morning, or as the light starts to fade in the evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green-Barber/Old 2018 camera&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the day, kangaroos rest in the cover of the woodlands and eat there but then come out in the open to feed on the grasslands in large numbers. The eastern grey kangaroo mainly graze a wide variety of grasses compared to other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) that also include significant amounts of shrubs in their diet.

Eastern grey kangaroos are gregarious and form open-membership groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colagross/Cockbrun 1993&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The groups contain an average of three individuals. Smaller groups join to graze in preferred foraging areas, and to rest in large groups around the middle of the day. They exist in a dominance hierarchy and the dominant individuals gain access to better sources of food and areas of shade. However, kangaroos are not territorial.
Eastern grey kangaroos adjust their behaviour in relation to the risk of predation with reproductive females, individuals on the periphery of the group and individuals in groups far from cover being the most vigilant. Vigilance in individual kangaroos does not seem to significantly decrease when the size of the group increases. However, there is a tendency for the proportion of individuals on the periphery of the group to decline as group size increases. The open membership of the group allows more kangaroos to join and thus provide more buffers against predators.

===Reproduction===
Eastern grey kangaroos are polygynous which means that one male mates with multiple females. Males do a lot of intraspecific competition for mates which includes male-male fights to determine dominance between the two males. When a dominant male finds a female in estrus, he will court the female and eventually they copulate. After copulation, the male will guard the female from other males. This whole process from courting to when the male is done guarding the singular females is roughly an hour.

Females may form strong kinship bonds with their relatives. Females with living female relatives have a greater chance of reproducing. Most kangaroo births occur during the summer. Eastern grey kangaroos are obligate breeders in that they can reproduce in only one kind of habitat.

The female eastern grey kangaroo is usually permanently pregnant except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. Since lactation is very energy expensive, females that are lactating typically change some of their foraging habits. Some females will forage faster so they can tend to their joeys more, while others forage more aggressively so they can eat as much as possible. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch.
Unusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm, and females will conceive only if there has been enough rain to produce a large quantity of green vegetation. Females take care of the young without any assistance from the males. Female kangaroos with a joey often feed solitary in order to help separate themselves from the rest of the kangaroos in order to reduce predation. The joeys are heavily reliant on their mothers for about 550 days, which is when they are weaned. Females sexually mature between 17 and 28 months, while males mature at around 25 months.
==Status==
It is popularly thought, but not confirmed by evidence, that kangaroo populations have increased significantly since the European colonisation of Australia because of the increased areas of grassland (as distinct from forest), the reduction in dingo numbers, and the availability of artificial watering holes. The estimated population of the species Australia-wide in 2010 was 11.4 million. In some places the eastern grey is so numerous it causes overgrazing and some individual populations have been culled in some parts of Australia (see, for example, the Eden Park Kangaroo Cull). Despite the commercial harvest and some culls, the eastern grey remains common and widespread. Eastern greys are common in suburban and rural areas where they have been observed to form larger groups than in natural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green-Barber/Old 2018 town&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It still covers the entire range it occupied when Europeans arrived in Australia in 1788 and it often comes into conflict with agriculture as it uses the more fertile districts that now carry crops or exotic pasture grasses, which kangaroos readily eat. Kangaroo meat has also been considered to replace beef in recent years, as their soft feet are preferable to hooves in erosion prone areas.

<text>The John Muir Trail (JMT) is a long-distance trail in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, passing through Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. It is named after John Muir, a naturalist.

From the northern terminus at Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley () and the southern terminus located on the summit of Mount Whitney (), the trail&#x27;s length is , with a total elevation gain of approximately . For almost all of its length, the trail is in the High Sierra backcountry and wilderness areas. For about , the trail is coincident with the longer Pacific Crest Trail.

The vast majority of the trail is within designated wilderness. The trail passes through large swaths of alpine and high mountain scenery, and lies almost entirely at or above in elevation. The trail sees about 1,500 thru-hiking attempts each year (including Pacific Crest Trail thru-hikers), many fewer than the number of attempts on comparable walks such as the southern portion of Appalachian Trail or the Way of St. James.

==History==
=== Paiute trade routes ===
Prior to the arrival of European-American settlers, the Paiute people living in the High Sierra region utilized a series of ancestral trails for hunting and trade with neighboring indigenous groups. In an effort to acknowledge the original people who traveled this region, some modern Native American and environmental organizations recognize the JMT as Nüümü Poyo, which translates to &quot;Paiute Road,&quot; &quot;Paiute Trail,&quot; or &quot;People&#x27;s Trail.&quot;

=== Proposal ===
The idea of a trail along the backbone of the High Sierra originated with Theodore Solomons. Solomons later recalled that the concept originated in his adolescence. &quot;The idea of a crest-parallel trail came to me one day while herding my uncle&#x27;s cattle in an immense unfenced alfalfa field near Fresno. It was 1884 and I was 14.&quot; He began advocating construction of the trail shortly after the Sierra Club was founded in 1892. John Muir was a founding member and first president of the Sierra Club. Solomons explored the area now known as the Evolution Basin, and traveled extensively throughout the High Sierra, exploring possible trail routes. Joseph Nisbet LeConte took up the cause in 1898 and the proposed trail was originally called the &quot;High Sierra Trail&quot;, although that name was later given to a different trail, running in the east–west direction. LeConte spent years exploring the canyons and passes of the Kings River and Kern River, and climbing peaks along the proposed trail. Along with James S. Hutchinson and Duncan McDuffie, he pioneered a high mountain route in 1908 from Yosemite National Park to Kings Canyon, roughly along the route of the modern JMT. In 28 days, they completed a trip of 228 miles through the high mountains, including several previously unexplored sections. In 1914, the Sierra Club appointed a committee to cooperate with the State of California to begin construction of the trail. John Muir died later that year, and the proposed trail was renamed in his honor.

=== Trail construction ===
Construction of the JMT began in 1915, a year after Muir&#x27;s death, with a $10,000 appropriation from the California legislature and Governor Hiram Johnson. State Engineer Wilbur F. McClure was made responsible for overseeing the project and selecting the final route, though he secured the cooperation of the United States Forest Service, which managed and supervised much of the actual construction, and LeConte was very influential regarding the eventual routing of the trail. The California state legislature made additional appropriations of $10,000 each in 1917, 1925, 1927 and 1929.

After the Depression began, assistance from the California state government came to an end, so the remainder of the trail had to be funded by a joint effort between the Forest Service and the National Park Service. At this time, there were still two difficult sections yet to be completed. The first section, the connection from the Kings River to the Kern River over Forester Pass, at an elevation of , was completed in 1932. The task of constructing trail down the steep southern side of the pass required crews to blast sections out of the rock, a dangerous process that resulted in the death of trail crew member Donald I. Downs in 1930. A plaque near the base of the pass memorializes Downs today.

The Forest Service completed the final section at Palisade Creek (in the Palisade Group) in 1938. This section passes by the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kings River and over Mather Pass by the &quot;Golden Staircase&quot; to the headwaters of the South Fork of the Kings River. Shortly after, this section was incorporated into newly created Kings Canyon National Park. The entire project had taken 46 years to complete. William Edward Colby, the first secretary of the Sierra Club, called the finished trail &quot;a most appropriate memorial to John Muir, who spent many of the best years of his life exploring the region which it will make accessible.&quot;

The California Wilderness Act of 1984 merged the John Muir Wilderness and the Ansel Adams Wilderness to maintain the continuous 250-mile stretch of the John Muir Trail from Yosemite to south of Mount Whitney.

==Route==

The JMT is long. From its northern terminus in Yosemite Valley, the trail runs southeast, passing south of Half Dome and then on to Tuolumne Meadows. From Tuolumne Meadows the trail turns south, running parallel to the main range of the Sierra Nevada, through Yosemite National Park, Inyo and Sierra national forests (including the John Muir Wilderness and Ansel Adams Wilderness), passing through Devils Postpile National Monument, Kings Canyon National Park, and ending on Mount Whitney in Sequoia National Park. From the southern terminus of the JMT at the summit of Mount Whitney, an additional hike on the Mount Whitney Trail is required to reach the nearest trailhead at Whitney Portal, thus making an end-to-end traverse of the JMT effectively .

===Yosemite National Park===
The trail begins at the Happy Isle bridge near the Happy Isles Nature Center. The trail ascends steeply up a paved incline before crossing another bridge meeting with the junction with the Mist Trail. The trail continues along a cut into Panorama Cliff, called the &quot;Ice Cut&quot;. Although broad and well-traveled, hazardous winter conditions and close proximity to civilization (attracting large numbers of day hikers) make this one of the most dangerous parts of the trail.

After some elevation gain via long switchbacks, the trail reaches the top of Nevada Falls. The trail continues into Little Yosemite Valley, past the trail junctions to Half Dome and Cloud&#x27;s Rest, and then into a subalpine basin and passing the Sunrise High Sierra Camp. The trail then crosses the Cathedral Range at Cathedral Pass before dropping steeply into Tuolumne Meadows, a common resupply point. The trail passes a visitor&#x27;s center and some campgrounds before linking up with the Pacific Crest Trail. The John Muir Trail/Pacific Crest Trail then turns south, through the mild Lyell Canyon meadow, and crosses the Cathedral Range again and exits the park at Donahue Pass.

===Ansel Adams Wilderness and Devils Postpile National Monument===

At the crest of Donahue Pass, the trail enters Inyo National Forest and the Ansel Adams Wilderness. The trail passes Thousand Island Lake, Garnet Lake, and a number of smaller lakes. The trail continues into Devils Postpile National Monument, where there are a number of opportunities to resupply or exit the trail. Devil&#x27;s Postpile is located a short distance from the trail.

===Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park===
The John Muir Trail next enters Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park crossing some spectacular alpine regions, including Evolution Basin, the Golden Staircase, and Forester Pass. The trail ends at the summit of Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States. From the summit of Mount Whitney, the closest trailhead is Whitney Portal.

==Elevation==
The lowest point on the trail is the northern terminus at Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley, at . The highest point on the trail is the southern terminus, Mount Whitney, at , which is also the highest point in the contiguous United States. The trail stays at high elevations, mostly above and with the exception of the first 7 miles directly south of the trail&#x27;s northern terminus, it never drops below . A large portion of the trail is more than high, including the entirety of the last . The trail crosses six mountain passes over ; from north to south, Donohue Pass, Muir Pass, Mather Pass, Pinchot Pass, Glen Pass, and Forester Pass. At , Forester Pass is also the highest point along the Pacific Crest Trail.

When the United States Geological Survey calculated the official length of the trail, elevation gain and loss was not taken into consideration. The total amount of ascent of the trail is around . According to Hipcamp and the John Muir Trail Foundation, the total descent of the trail is ; however, Backpacker estimates the total descent as 2,000 feet less, at . This produces a total of about , or almost ; however, this does not mean the total length is increased by . Rather, the triangle inequality implies that the error due to neglecting elevation changes underestimates the true length by no greater than this value.

According to Backpacker magazine, in total, the trail gains in elevation.

==Hiking==
The primary hiking season is usually from July through September; during this time, most of the snow from the previous year has melted, but new snow hasn&#x27;t fallen yet. Early season hikers have to contend not only with the snowpack and icy slopes near the passes, but with streams swollen with snowmelt. Trail conditions are less demanding later in the season after the snowmelt concludes, and the weather generally remains pleasant for hiking through September. Weather during the hiking season is generally sunny and dry, but afternoon thunderstorms are not uncommon. The trail is used primarily by backpackers and dayhikers, but also by runners, trail riders, and pack trains. There is a shelter for hikers to stay at on Muir Pass, called the John Muir Hut, which is the only shelter on the trail.

Hikers completing the trail typically take about three weeks. The record for the fastest known time was set by ultrarunner François D&#x27;Haene in 2017, who ran from south to north in 2 days, 19 hours and 26 minutes. The previous record of 3 days, 7 hours and 36 minutes, was set by Leor Pantilat in 2014. The record for the fastest trip in an unsupported way was set by Aurélien Sanchez in 2018, who ran from south to north in 3 days, 3 hours and 55 minutes. The previous record of three days, ten hours, and 59 minutes was set by Andrew Bentz in 2014.
A permit is required to hike the JMT, which can be obtained from the national park or forest where the hiker begins the hike, and is available 168 days in advance. This single permit is valid for the entire hike. Permit reservations can be hard to obtain for JMT thru-hikers, but a portion of permits are reserved for walk-ins. The Whitney Portal end of the JMT has a lottery for wilderness permits, and hikers starting in Yosemite face competition with other backpackers simply wanting to camp overnight while hiking Half Dome or to Tuolumne Meadows. Backpackers entering the Sierra backcountry on multi-day trips are generally required to carry their food in approved hard-sided storage containers known as bear canisters to protect their food and other scented items from theft by black bears, which are common in the region.

About 90-96 percent of hikers hike north to south, from Yosemite Valley to Mt. Whitney. There are advantages to starting in Yosemite Valley and hiking south. Although there is a significant net altitude gain this way, starting at a lower altitude allows the hiker time to acclimate to the elevations of the trail rather than immediately having to tackle a 6,000-foot (1,800 m) climb to the summit of Mount Whitney. In addition, there are several resupply points convenient to the JMT during its northern half (Tuolumne Meadows, Reds Meadow, Vermillion Valley Resort, Muir Trail Ranch), allowing the hiker to carry a lighter food load early in the hike and also to exit the trail easily if problems arise. The southern half of the JMT is more remote and generally higher in elevation, thus making it more appropriate for the second half of the hike when maximum conditioning has been attained.

<doc id="215031" wikidata="Q1391212" url="?curid=215031" title="Muhammad al-Muqri">
<text>Haj Muhammad Ben Abdessalam al-Muqri (, February 2, 1854 – September 9, 1957), alternatively transcribed as Mohammed El Mokri, was a senior Moroccan official of the late 19th and early 20th century. He was an adviser and grand vizier to several sultans of Morocco, including under French colonial domination.

==Early life==
Muhammad Al-Muqri came from a well-known family whose descendants successively held government portfolios in Morocco. They trace their lineage back to 16th and 17th century historian and statesman Ahmed al-Moqri who, coming from Tlemcen in Algeria, had settled in Fes then in Marrakesh to serve under Saadi Sultan Ahmed Al-Mansur Al-Dhahabi. Muhammad al-Moqri was born in Oujda (February 1851) to Abdesallam al-Moqri (1830–1903), who held the position of &quot;Lamin&quot; of Moulay Hafid, and a Fassi woman from the Zghari family.

==Career==
He began his career in government during the reign of Muhammad IV of Morocco, the father of Hassan I of Morocco. During this period of time, al-Muqri is alleged to have attended the opening of the Suez Canal where he met with Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie in 1869. After the death of Hassan I, sultan, Abd al-Aziz seized the throne.

=== Algeciras Conference ===
At that time, Al Muqri was the country&#x27;s representative to the 1906 Algeciras Conference at which Germany&#x27;s demand for a say in Moroccan affairs was rejected in favor of France and Spain. In recognition of his efforts to resolve the Moroccan Crisis leading up to the international conference, Abd al-Aziz appointed al-Muqri as his Minister of Finance and in 1908, his () or Grand Vizier, a post he would hold on and off under each of the succeeding sultans until 1955. 
In 1909, the new sultan Abd Al-Hafid demoted him to the post of Minister of Finance but promoted him again to Grand Vizier in 1911. Al-Muqri resigned the post two years later, but was reappointed to it by Sultan Yusef, and was kept in the position by his successor, Sultan Muhammad ben Youssef, when he ascended the throne in 1927. In 1953, when Muhammad ben Youssef was deposed by the French for nationalist agitation and replaced by his uncle, the French puppet monarch Muhammad Ben Arafa, the colonial authorities decided to keep al-Muqri in his position. Once independence was promised, Ben Arafa abdicated, and al-Muqri was chosen by colonial authorities to head the Regency, among other dignitaries such as Pacha Fatmi Benslimane, until the exiled Sultan Muhammad could return to the country and assume the throne.

== Death ==
Al-Muqri (sometimes spelled &quot;El Mokri&quot;) left politics in 1955, shortly before Morocco gained its independence. He died two years later, &quot;penniless and dishonored&quot; for having backed Mohammed Ben Aarafa. He was purportedly a centenarian.

== Legacy ==
After his death his residence in Rabat (known as &quot;Dar el Mokri&quot;) became an infamous location of detention and torture in the 1950s, 60s and up to the 1970s, during what was termed as the Years of Lead.

==Family==
Muhammad al-Muqri married three women (one Algerian and two Moroccan) with whom he had five sons and a daughter, all born during 1890–1900:
*Taieb al-Moqri, Pasha of Casablanca and Minister of finance.
*Hammed al-Moqri (), Khalifa of the Pasha of Fes.
*Tahar al-Moqri, Pasha of Safi and head of the customs of Casablanca (studied in France).
*Mokhtar al-Moqri, Pasha and head of the customs of Tangier (studied in France).
*Thami al-Moqri, Minister of Finance and first agricultural engineer of Morocco. 
*Ruqaya al-Moqri, married Sultan Moulay Hafid then his brother Moulay Youssef.
*Zineb al-Moqri, married Madani El Glaoui, grand vizier, then his brother Thami El Glaoui, Pacha of Marrakech.

==Longevity claim==
It is claimed that al-Moqri died at the reputed age of 112, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, or even of 116, according to other sources. Both figures are doubtful. There are no birth records or other evidence for these claims. It is rare to attain such an age and unheard of to be head of government at 110 or 114. John Gunther&#x27;s book &quot;Inside Africa&quot; (published 1955) says he was born in 1851: other sources list his birth year as 1854. Vermeren gives 1860. The Britannica Book of the Year gives his birthdate as February 1841.

<text>: &quot;This is about the American naval officer. For others, see Donald Duncan (disambiguation).&quot;
Donald Bradley Duncan (1896–1975) was an admiral in the United States Navy, who played an important role in aircraft-carrier operations during World War II.

Duncan graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1917, and was assigned to the USS Oklahoma (BB-37). He received a master&#x27;s degree in radio engineering from Harvard University in 1925.

In July 1935, Duncan assumed command of Scouting Squadron 3B (VS-3B) assigned to USS Lexington (CV-2).

In 1941, he was the first commander of the USS &quot;Long Island&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s first escort aircraft carrier.

As the air operations officer to Admiral Ernest J. King, Duncan assisted with the planning for the Doolittle Raid, and was the one who proposed the use of both the B-25 Mitchell bombers and the &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-8) for the raid. He was then appointed to be the first commanding officer of the carrier &quot;Essex&quot; (CV-9).

Duncan held several important staff and operational positions following the war. He served as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air) from March 6, 1947, to January 20, 1948. He commanded the 2nd Task Fleet after 1948, and was the Vice Chief of Naval Operations from 1951 to 1956.

Following his retirement from the navy on March 1, 1957, he served as Governor of the Naval Home until May 1962. He died on September 8, 1975.

<doc id="215035" wikidata="Q7828203" url="?curid=215035" title="Totally Gross Germs">
<text>The Germs is a comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;. It first appeared in issue 2374, dated 16 January 1988, replacing the Rasher strip, where the characters had been introduced the previous week.

The strip was about a boy called Will who had three germs inside him (Ugly Jack Bacteria, Jeremy Germ, and Iris the Virus), and they were constantly making Will ill, requiring many visits to the doctor. Iris&#x27; name later changed to Violet Virus.

The Germs were sometimes stopped in their tracks with a grown-up looking germ called Auntie Biotic (a pun on &quot;antibiotic&quot;). 

The strip was originally drawn by David Sutherland, and was taken over by Vic Neill later on. Around this time Will&#x27;s name was added onto the title, the wording changing every so often, such as including (also featuring Ill Will), (also starring Ill Will) or (with Ill Will). Due to Neill&#x27;s work on Billy Whizz and Tim Traveller, the strip appeared on an increasingly irregular basis in the late 1990s, and after Neill&#x27;s death in 2000, it disappeared from &quot;The Beano&quot;. In 2004 it briefly returned with a new artist, Nigel Parkinson. However, the strip only made three appearances which were spread over the year, and was dropped once again.

It returned to the comic in October 2011 as reprints of the David Sutherland strips, and later Vic Neill reprints in April 2012, along with Number 13, this time retitled as &quot;Totally Gross Germs&quot;. The following month, they were retitled again, as &quot;The Germs: Totally Gross&quot;.

In Issue 3618 they returned to their original title.

<text>In genetics, an enhancer is a short (50–1500 bp) region of DNA that can be bound by proteins (activators) to increase the likelihood that transcription of a particular gene will occur. These proteins are usually referred to as transcription factors. Enhancers are &quot;cis&quot;-acting. They can be located up to 1 Mbp (1,000,000 bp) away from the gene, upstream or downstream from the start site. There are hundreds of thousands of enhancers in the human genome. They are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Active enhancers typically get transcribed as enhancer or regulatory non-coding RNA, whose expression levels correlate with mRNA levels of target genes.

The first discovery of a eukaryotic enhancer was in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene in 1983. This enhancer, located in the large intron, provided an explanation for the transcriptional activation of rearranged Vh gene promoters while unrearranged Vh promoters remained inactive. Lately, enhancers have been shown to be involved in certain medical conditions, for example, myelosuppression. Since 2022, scientists have used artificial intelligence to design synthetic enhancers and applied them in animal systems, first in a cell line, and one year later also in vivo.

==Locations==
In eukaryotic cells the structure of the chromatin complex of DNA is folded in a way that functionally mimics the supercoiled state characteristic of prokaryotic DNA, so although the enhancer DNA may be far from the gene in a linear way, it is spatially close to the promoter and gene. This allows it to interact with the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. The same mechanism holds true for silencers in the eukaryotic genome. Silencers are antagonists of enhancers that, when bound to its proper transcription factors called repressors, repress the transcription of the gene. Silencers and enhancers may be in close proximity to each other or may even be in the same region only differentiated by the transcription factor the region binds to.

An enhancer may be located upstream or downstream of the gene it regulates. Furthermore, an enhancer does not need to be located near the transcription initiation site to affect transcription, as some have been found located several hundred thousand base pairs upstream or downstream of the start site. Enhancers do not act on the promoter region itself, but are bound by activator proteins as first shown by in vivo competition experiments. Subsequently, molecular studies showed direct interactions with transcription factors and cofactors, including the mediator complex, which recruits polymerase II and the general transcription factors which then begin transcribing the genes. Enhancers can also be found within introns. An enhancer&#x27;s orientation may even be reversed without affecting its function; additionally, an enhancer may be excised and inserted elsewhere in the chromosome, and still affect gene transcription. That is one reason that introns polymorphisms may have effects although they are not translated. Enhancers can also be found at the exonic region of an unrelated gene and they may act on genes on another chromosome.

Enhancers are bound by p300-CBP and their location can be predicted by ChIP-seq against this family of coactivators.

===Role in gene expression===
Gene expression in mammals is regulated by many cis-regulatory elements, including core promoters and promoter-proximal elements that are located near the transcription start sites of genes. Core promoters are sufficient to direct transcription
initiation, but generally have low basal activity. Other important cis-regulatory modules are localized in DNA regions that are distant from the transcription start sites. These include enhancers, silencers, insulators and tethering elements. Among this constellation of elements, enhancers and their associated transcription factors have a leading role in the regulation of gene expression. An enhancer localized in a DNA region distant from the promoter of a gene can have a very large effect on gene expression, with some genes undergoing up to 100-fold increased expression due to an activated enhancer.

Enhancers are regions of the genome that are major gene-regulatory elements. Enhancers control cell-type-specific gene expression programs, most often by looping through long distances to come in physical proximity with the promoters of their target genes. While there are hundreds of thousands of enhancer DNA regions, for a particular type of tissue only specific enhancers are brought into proximity with the promoters that they regulate. In a study of brain cortical neurons, 24,937 loops were found, bringing enhancers to their target promoters. Multiple enhancers, each often at tens or hundreds of thousands of nucleotides distant from their target genes, loop to their target gene promoters and can coordinate with each other to control the expression of their common target gene.

The schematic illustration in this section shows an enhancer looping around to come into close physical proximity with the promoter of a target gene. The loop is stabilized by a dimer of a connector protein (e.g. dimer of CTCF or YY1), with one member of the dimer anchored to its binding motif on the enhancer and the other member anchored to its binding motif on the promoter (represented by the red zigzags in the illustration). Several cell function specific transcription factors (there are about 1,600 transcription factors in a human cell) generally bind to specific motifs on an enhancer and a small combination of these enhancer-bound transcription factors, when brought close to a promoter by a DNA loop, govern level of transcription of the target gene. Mediator (a complex usually consisting of about 26 proteins in an interacting structure) communicates regulatory signals from enhancer DNA-bound transcription factors directly to the RNA polymerase II (pol II) enzyme bound to the promoter.

Enhancers, when active, are generally transcribed from both strands of DNA with RNA polymerases acting in two different directions, producing two Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) as illustrated in the Figure. Like mRNAs, these eRNAs are usually protected by their 5′ cap. An inactive enhancer may be bound by an inactive transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor may activate it and that activated transcription factor may then activate the enhancer to which it is bound (see small red star representing phosphorylation of transcription factor bound to enhancer in the illustration). An activated enhancer begins transcription of its RNA before activating transcription of messenger RNA from its target gene.

==Theories==
, there are two different theories on the information processing that occurs on enhancers:
* Enhanceosomes – rely on highly cooperative, coordinated action and can be disabled by single point mutations that move or remove the binding sites of individual proteins.
* Flexible billboards – less integrative, multiple proteins independently regulate gene expression and their sum is read in by the basal transcriptional machinery.

==Examples in the human genome==

===HACNS1===
HACNS1 (also known as CENTG2 and located in the Human Accelerated Region 2) is a gene enhancer &quot;that may have contributed to the evolution of the uniquely opposable human thumb, and possibly also modifications in the ankle or foot that allow humans to walk on two legs&quot;. Evidence to date shows that of the 110,000 gene enhancer sequences identified in the human genome, HACNS1 has undergone the most change during the evolution of humans following the split with the ancestors of chimpanzees.

===GADD45G===
An enhancer near the gene GADD45g has been described that may regulate brain growth in chimpanzees and other mammals, but not in humans. The GADD45G regulator in mice and chimps is active in regions of the brain where cells that form the cortex, ventral forebrain, and thalamus are located and may suppress further neurogenesis. Loss of the GADD45G enhancer in humans may contribute to an increase of certain neuronal populations and to forebrain expansion in humans.

==In developmental biology==

The development, differentiation and growth of cells and tissues require precisely regulated patterns of gene expression. Enhancers work as cis-regulatory elements to mediate both spatial and temporal control of development by turning on transcription in specific cells and/or repressing it in other cells. Thus, the particular combination of transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins in a developing tissue controls which genes will be expressed in that tissue. Enhancers allow the same gene to be used in diverse processes in space and time.

===Identification and characterization===

Traditionally, enhancers were identified by enhancer trap techniques using a reporter gene or by comparative sequence analysis and computational genomics. In genetically tractable models such as the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster,&quot; for example, a reporter construct such as the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene can be randomly integrated into the genome using a P element transposon. If the reporter gene integrates near an enhancer, its expression will reflect the expression pattern driven by that enhancer. Thus, staining the flies for LacZ expression or activity and cloning the sequence surrounding the integration site allows the identification of the enhancer sequence.

The development of genomic and epigenomic technologies, however, has dramatically changed the outlook for cis-regulatory modules (CRM) discovery. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods now enable high-throughput functional CRM discovery assays, and the vastly increasing amounts of available data, including large-scale libraries of transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) motifs, collections of annotated, validated CRMs, and extensive epigenetic data across many cell types, are making accurate computational CRM discovery an attainable goal. An example of NGS-based approach called DNase-seq have enabled identification of nucleosome-depleted, or open chromatin regions, which can contain CRM. More recently techniques such as ATAC-seq have been developed which require less starting material. Nucelosome depleted regions can be identified in vivo through expression of Dam methylase, allowing for greater control of cell-type specific enhancer identification.
Computational methods include comparative genomics, clustering of known or predicted TF-binding sites, and supervised machine-learning approaches trained on known CRMs. 
All of these methods have proven effective for CRM discovery, but each has its own considerations and limitations, and each is subject to a greater or lesser number of false-positive identifications.
In the comparative genomics approach, sequence conservation of non-coding regions can be indicative of enhancers. Sequences from multiple species are aligned, and conserved regions are identified computationally. Identified sequences can then be attached to a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein or lacZ to determine the &quot;in vivo&quot; pattern of gene expression produced by the enhancer when injected into an embryo. mRNA expression of the reporter can be visualized by &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization, which provides a more direct measure of enhancer activity, since it is not subjected to the complexities of translation and protein folding. Although much evidence has pointed to sequence conservation for critical developmental enhancers, other work has shown that the function of enhancers can be conserved with little or no primary sequence conservation. For example, the &quot;RET&quot; enhancers in humans have very little sequence conservation to those in zebrafish, yet both species&#x27; sequences produce nearly identical patterns of reporter gene expression in zebrafish. Similarly, in highly diverged insects (separated by around 350 million years), similar gene expression patterns of several key genes was found to be regulated through similarly constituted CRMs although these CRMs do not show any appreciable sequence conservation detectable by standard sequence alignment methods such as BLAST.

===In segmentation of insects===

The enhancers determining early segmentation in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; embryos are among the best characterized developmental enhancers. In the early fly embryo, the gap gene transcription factors are responsible for activating and repressing a number of segmentation genes, such as the pair rule genes. The gap genes are expressed in blocks along the anterior-posterior axis of the fly along with other maternal effect transcription factors, thus creating zones within which different combinations of transcription factors are expressed. The pair-rule genes are separated from one another by non-expressing cells. Moreover, the stripes of expression for different pair-rule genes are offset by a few cell diameters from one another. Thus, unique combinations of pair-rule gene expression create spatial domains along the anterior-posterior axis to set up each of the 14 individual segments. The 480 bp enhancer responsible for driving the sharp stripe two of the pair-rule gene &quot;even-skipped&quot; (&quot;eve&quot;) has been well-characterized. The enhancer contains 12 different binding sites for maternal and gap gene transcription factors. Activating and repressing sites overlap in sequence. &quot;Eve&quot; is only expressed in a narrow stripe of cells that contain high concentrations of the activators and low concentration of the repressors for this enhancer sequence. Other enhancer regions drive &quot;eve&quot; expression in 6 other stripes in the embryo.

===In vertebrate patterning===

Establishing body axes is a critical step in animal development. During mouse embryonic development, Nodal, a transforming growth factor-beta superfamily ligand, is a key gene involved in patterning both the anterior-posterior axis and the left-right axis of the early embryo. The &quot;Nodal&quot; gene contains two enhancers: the Proximal Epiblast Enhancer (PEE) and the Asymmetric Enhancer (ASE). The PEE is upstream of the Nodal gene and drives &quot;Nodal&quot; expression in the portion of the primitive streak that will differentiate into the node (also referred to as the primitive node). The PEE turns on Nodal expression in response to a combination of Wnt signaling plus a second, unknown signal; thus, a member of the LEF/TCF transcription factor family likely binds to a TCF binding site in the cells in the node. Diffusion of Nodal away from the node forms a gradient which then patterns the extending anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The ASE is an intronic enhancer bound by the fork head domain transcription factor Fox1. Early in development, Fox1-driven Nodal expression establishes the visceral endoderm. Later in development, Fox1 binding to the ASE drives &quot;Nodal&quot; expression on the left side of the lateral plate mesoderm, thus establishing left-right asymmetry necessary for asymmetric organ development in the mesoderm.

Establishing three germ layers during gastrulation is another critical step in animal development. Each of the three germ layers has unique patterns of gene expression that promote their differentiation and development. The endoderm is specified early in development by &quot;Gata4&quot; expression, and Gata4 goes on to direct gut morphogenesis later. &quot;Gata4&quot; expression is controlled in the early embryo by an intronic enhancer that binds another forkhead domain transcription factor, FoxA2. Initially the enhancer drives broad gene expression throughout the embryo, but the expression quickly becomes restricted to the endoderm, suggesting that other repressors may be involved in its restriction. Late in development, the same enhancer restricts expression to the tissues that will become the stomach and pancreas. An additional enhancer is responsible for maintaining &quot;Gata4&quot; expression in the endoderm during the intermediate stages of gut development.

===Multiple enhancers promote developmental robustness===

Some genes involved in critical developmental processes contain multiple enhancers of overlapping function. Secondary enhancers, or &quot;shadow enhancers&quot;, may be found many kilobases away from the primary enhancer (&quot;primary&quot; usually refers to the first enhancer discovered, which is often closer to the gene it regulates). On its own, each enhancer drives nearly identical patterns of gene expression. Are the two enhancers truly redundant? Recent work has shown that multiple enhancers allow fruit flies to survive environmental perturbations, such as an increase in temperature. When raised at an elevated temperature, a single enhancer sometimes fails to drive the complete pattern of expression, whereas the presence of both enhancers permits normal gene expression.

==Evolution of developmental mechanisms==

One theme of research in evolutionary developmental biology (&quot;evo-devo&quot;) is investigating the role of enhancers and other cis-regulatory elements in producing morphological changes via developmental differences between species.

===Stickleback &quot;Pitx1&quot;===

Recent work has investigated the role of enhancers in morphological changes in threespine stickleback fish. Sticklebacks exist in both marine and freshwater environments, but sticklebacks in many freshwater populations have completely lost their pelvic fins (appendages homologous to the posterior limb of tetrapods).&lt;br&gt; &quot;Pitx1&quot; is a homeobox gene involved in posterior limb development in vertebrates. Preliminary genetic analyses indicated that changes in the expression of this gene were responsible for pelvic reduction in sticklebacks. Fish expressing only the freshwater allele of &quot;Pitx1&quot; do not have pelvic spines, whereas fish expressing a marine allele retain pelvic spines. A more thorough characterization showed that a 500 base pair enhancer sequence is responsible for turning on &quot;Pitx1&quot; expression in the posterior fin bud. This enhancer is located near a chromosomal fragile site—a sequence of DNA that is likely to be broken and thus more likely to be mutated as a result of imprecise DNA repair. This fragile site has caused repeated, independent losses of the enhancer responsible for driving &quot;Pitx1&quot; expression in the pelvic spines in isolated freshwater population, and without this enhancer, freshwater fish fail to develop pelvic spines.

===In &quot;Drosophila&quot; wing pattern evolution===

Pigmentation patterns provide one of the most striking and easily scored differences between different species of animals. Pigmentation of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; wing has proven to be a particularly amenable system for studying the development of complex pigmentation phenotypes. The &quot;Drosophila guttifera&quot; wing has 12 dark pigmentation spots and 4 lighter gray intervein patches. Pigment spots arise from expression of the &quot;yellow&quot; gene, whose product produces black melanin. Recent work has shown that two enhancers in the &quot;yellow&quot; gene produce gene expression in precisely this pattern – the vein spot enhancer drives reporter gene expression in the 12 spots, and the intervein shade enhancer drives reporter expression in the 4 distinct patches. These two enhancers are responsive to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is activated by &quot;wingless&quot; expression at all of the pigmented locations. Thus, in the evolution of the complex pigmentation phenotype, the &quot;yellow&quot; pigment gene evolved enhancers responsive to the wingless signal and &quot;wingless&quot; expression evolved at new locations to produce novel wing patterns.

===In inflammation and cancer===

Each cell typically contains several hundred of a special class of enhancers that stretch over many kilobases long DNA sequences, called &quot;super-enhancers&quot;. These enhancers contain a large number of binding sites for sequence-specific, inducible transcription factors, and regulate expression of genes involved in cell differentiation. During inflammation, the transcription factor NF-κB facilitates remodeling of chromatin in a manner that selectively redistributes cofactors from high-occupancy enhancers, thereby repressing genes involved in maintaining cellular identify whose expression they enhance; at the same time, this F-κB-driven remodeling and redistribution activates other enhancers that guide changes in cellular function through inflammation. As a result, inflammation reprograms cells, altering their interactions with the rest of tissue and with the immune system. In cancer, proteins that control NF-κB activity are dysregulated, permitting malignant cells to decrease their dependence on interactions with local tissue, and hindering their surveillance by the immune system.

== Designing enhancers in synthetic biology ==

Synthetic regulatory elements such as enhancers promise to be a powerful tool to direct gene products to particular cell types in order to treat disease by activating beneficial genes or by halting aberrant cell states. 
Since 2022, artificial intelligence and transfer learning strategies have led to a better understanding of the features of regulatory DNA sequences, the prediction, and the design of synthetic enhancers.
Building on work in cell culture, synthetic enhancers were successfully applied to entire living organisms in 2023. Using deep neural networks, scientists simulated the evolution of DNA sequences to analyze the emergence of features that underlie enhancer function. This allowed the design and production of a range of functioning synthetic enhancers for different cell types of the fruit fly brain. A second approach trained artificial intelligence models on single-cell DNA accessibility data and transferred the learned models towards the prediction of enhancers for selected tissues in the fruit fly embryo. These enhancer prediction models were used to design synthetic enhancers for the nervous system, brain, muscle, epidermis and gut.

<doc id="215039" wikidata="Q3498361" url="?curid=215039" title="Wonderland Trail">
<text>The Wonderland Trail is an approximately hiking trail that circumnavigates Mount Rainier in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, United States. The trail goes over many ridges of Mount Rainier for a cumulative of elevation gain. The trail was built in 1915. In 1981, it was designated a National Recreation Trail. An estimated 200 to 250 people a year complete the entire trail with several thousand others doing shorter sections of it. The average time taken to complete the entire trip is 10 to 14 days.

== Route ==
The trail is entirely within the national park and passes through major life zones of the park, from lowland forests to subalpine meadows of wildflowers. As the trail circles the mountain, hikers see different faces of Mount Rainier, carved by 25 named glaciers.

The trail is considered strenuous as it is almost always climbing or descending the ridges around the mountain. The highest point is at Panhandle Gap.
There are many river crossings on the trail including two suspension bridges. Many of the rivers are crossed on primitive log bridges which can wash away during heavy rain or when there is a lot of snow melt in the rivers. Most of the bridges washed away during a major storm in November 2006, so the trail was impassable (and closed) to hikers through most of 2007.

The main hiking season is late summer, which is often dry and sunny. However, Mount Rainier&#x27;s high elevation and proximity to the Pacific Ocean can also bring moisture as rain or snow to the trail. In many years, the Wonderland Trail is still mostly snow-covered during June and early July.

The traditional route between Mowich Lake and the Carbon River is via Ipsut Pass and Ipsut Creek. Many people take an alternative route across Spray Park and Seattle Park, a higher elevation route that often lies under snow until late August.

Complete trail descriptions may be found in a variety of trailbooks.

== Camping ==
Camping along the Wonderland Trail is extremely popular throughout the summer and wilderness camping reservations are essential for many of the most popular campsites. Eighteen trailside camps, apart, are located along the Wonderland Trail. Each camp has 1 to 8 sites for 1 to 5 persons per site. These sites will hold at most 2 tents. Parties requiring space for 3 or more tents must camp in a group site. Group sites are available at certain camps for parties of 6 to 12 persons. These sites typically hold 3 to 5 tents. Each camp has cleared tent sites, a pit or composting toilet, a bear pole for hanging food, and a nearby water source.

== Trail shelters ==
There are three backcountry shelters along the Wonderland Trail in the National Park Service rustic. They are the Summerland Trail Shelter, the Indian Bar Trail Shelter, and North Mowich Trail Shelter. Staying at these shelters is considered backcountry camping and requires a permit. The shelters were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1934 and 1940. See Wonderland Trail Shelters.

== Wilderness permits ==
A backcountry permit, including reservations for designated camping areas, is required to hike the Wonderland Trail. Prospective hikers can enter a lottery for permits early in the year. After the lottery, people may reserve designated camping areas using the federal government&#x27;s Recreation.gov website. 30% of slots are held for &#x27;walk-up&#x27; allocation at the park&#x27;s wilderness centers.

Due to the damage suffered as the result of a flood in November 2006 the park service did not accept reservations for the 2007 summer season for attempts to hike the entire Wonderland Trail. The trail was reopened on August 3, 2007, after extensive work by the park service, the Washington Conservation Corps, Student Conservation Association and 1,700 volunteers.

<doc id="215041" wikidata="Q276937" url="?curid=215041" title="Yusef of Morocco">
<text>&quot;Moulay&quot; Yusef ben Hassan (), born in Meknes on 1882 and died in Fes in 1927, was the &#x27;Alawi sultan of Morocco from 1912 to 1927. He was the son of Hassan I of Morocco, who was the son of Muhammad IV of Morocco.

==Life==

Moulay Yusef was born in the city of Meknes to Sultan Hassan I. His mother is Lalla Um al-Khair, a Moroccan lady whose last name is not recorded. He has a twin brother, Moulay Mohammed al-Tahar. He inherited the throne from Sultan Abd al-Hafid, who abdicated after the Treaty of Fez (1912), which made Morocco a French protectorate.

Moulay Yusef&#x27;s reign was turbulent and marked with frequent uprisings against Spain and France, of which two were serious: the Rif War and the Sahrawi rebellion. The Rif War was a Berber uprising led by Abd el-Krim in the Rif in the Spanish colony in the north; el-Krim managed to establish the Republic of the Rif. The second was an uprising of the Hasani-Sanhaja Sahrawis in the French colony in the south, which was led by Ahmed al-Hiba, the son of Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn.

The Rif War eventually reached the French colonial region, prompting the creation of a Franco-Spanish military coalition that finally defeated the rebels in 1925. To ensure his own safety, Yusef moved the court from Fez to Rabat, which has served as the capital of the country ever since.

Yusef&#x27;s reign came to an abrupt end when he died suddenly of uremia in 1927. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammed V, and was buried in the royal necropolis of the Moulay Abdallah Mosque.

== Private life ==
Moulay Youssef married three times and had at least eight children. The fact that he had a harem is not explicitly stated, it is only indicated that he had a slave concubine whom he ended up marrying. Here are the descent he had with his wives:

Lalla Yacout, whose last name is not recorded, was his first wife. Their marriage took place around 1907, she died on September 1, 1953, and was buried in Fez. Among their children are:

* Moulay Idriss (1908–1962), he was removed from the order of succession because he suffered from an autoimmune disease;
* Sultan Sidi Mohammed (1909–1961), better known as King Mohammed V;
* Lalla Amina, she was nicknamed &quot;la parisienne&quot;, for her fondness of this city, she often travelled there. 
* Moulay Abdeslam, born in 1914.

Lalla Ruqaya bint Mohammed al-Moqri, he married her around 1915. They had no children together. Before this marriage she was the wife of Sultan Moulay Abdelhafid, but divorced from the latter;

A woman whose identity is unknown who is either his slave concubine or one of his wives. She is probably the mother of two of Moulay Youssef&#x27;s distinctly mixed-race children:

* Mohammed al Hassan, (1909–1969)
* Lalla Zainab

The identity of the mother of two of Sultan Moulay Youssef&#x27;s daughters is not mentioned. These daughters are:

* Lalla Zubaida;
* Lalla Khadija, she married a man from the Boufarès family, their son was Moulay Mamoun Boufarès. The latter, together with his wife, had a daughter. The daughter became Princess Lalla Oum Kelthoum, the wife of Prince Moulay Rachid.

Aïsha, a slave concubine of unknown origins whom Moulay Youssef ends up marrying. Around 1924, she was offered to the sultan by the Pasha of Marrakesh Thami El Glaoui. Described as very beautiful, she became Lalla Aïsha after entering the harem. Yacout Sasson was charged by the sultan with personally taking care of her clothing. Aïsha became very close to her seamstress who spoiled her and prepared the best dishes of Jewish cuisine. She was pampered and chose the fabrics for her ceremonial clothes before anyone else. Her first pregnancy, which was also her last, ended in tragedy when at seven months her fetus perished and childbirth had to be induced a month later, the child stillborn. The sultan moved by her hardship married her, putting an end to her status of concubine and granted her the title of &quot;Oum Sidi&quot; Aïsha, a title reserved for the mother of the heir to the throne. They had no children together.

<text>The Beezer (called The Beezer and Topper for the last three years of publication) was a British comic that ran from (issues dates) 21 January 1956 to 21 August 1993, published by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd. Comic strips in &quot;The Beezer&quot; were a mix of irreverence, slapstick, and adventure; notable creators included Leo Baxendale, Gordon Bell, Paddy Brennan, David Law, Tom Paterson, Bill Ritchie, Dudley D. Watkins, Malcolm Judge, and John Geering.

== Publication history ==
Like its sister comic, &quot;The Topper&quot;, &quot;The Beezer&quot; was an A3 (tabloid) publication, twice as big as most other comics. It shrank to A4 paper size in 1981.

Comics that merged into &quot;The Beezer&quot; during its 37-year run were &quot;Cracker&quot; in 1976, and &quot;Plug&quot; in 1979.

The Beezer launched an annual, &quot;The Beezer Book&quot;, in 1957; this continued in publication following the closure of the weekly comic, and ran until the 2003 book (published 2002).

=== 1990 merger with &quot;The Topper&quot; ===
In September 1990, DC Thomson decided to rationalise their comics portfolio and merged the &quot;Beezer&quot; with &quot;The Topper&quot;. Whereas most previous comic mergers saw the name of one of the &#x27;absorbed&#x27; comics disappear, &quot;The Topper&quot; was considered significant enough for its name to be retained despite the merger and as such the comic was renamed &quot;Beezer and Topper&quot; following the relaunch (&quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; was conceived as a double comic, and was not the result of a merger.)

=== Cancellation/merger with &quot;The Beano&quot; ===
&quot;Beezer and Topper&quot; ceased publication as a weekly comic in 1993; when it closed it was essentially (unofficially) &quot;merged&quot; with &quot;The Beano&quot;, as this is where the bulk of surviving content from the comic (most prominently &quot;The Numskulls&quot;) ended up. Some also went to DC Thomson&#x27;s other surviving weekly comic, &quot;The Dandy&quot;.

== Annuals and other &quot;Beezer&quot; publications ==
Although the weekly &quot;Beezer&quot; and &quot;Topper&quot; had merged, the two comics&#x27; annuals (&quot;The Beezer Book&quot; and &quot;The Topper Book&quot;) remained separate publications. The closure of &quot;Beezer and Topper&quot; led to the closure of the &quot;Topper&quot; annual as of the 1994 book (published 1993), but &quot;The Beezer Book&quot; continued in publication annually for some years thereafter, eventually ceasing with the 2003 book (published 2002). Other &quot;Beezer&quot; publications that continued after the weekly comic&#x27;s closure were &quot;The Best of Beezer&quot; (launched 1988, closed 1996) and &quot;The Beezer Summer Special&quot; (launched 1973, known as the &#x27;Holiday Special&#x27; from 1998 onwards, closed 2002).

Vintage strips from the &quot;Beezer&quot; were published alongside stories from other DC Thomson publications in &quot;Classics from the Comics&quot;, which was published from 1996 to 2010.

A &quot;The Best of the Beezer Annual&quot; was released in 2014, published by Pedigree Books as part of the &quot;Retro Classics&quot; series. It contained reprints of old Beezer comics. Despite the name saying &quot;annual&quot;, a second book was never released.

==Strips==
&quot;The Beezer&quot; was home to 120 different comic strips over the years.

<text>The treepies (known also as crypsirinines from the subfamily&#x27;s name, Crypsirininae) comprise four closely related genera (&quot;Dendrocitta&quot;, &quot;Crypsirina&quot;, &quot;Temnurus&quot; and &quot;Platysmurus&quot;) of long-tailed passerine birds in the family Corvidae. There are 12 species of treepie. Some treepies are similar to magpies. Most treepies are black, white, gray or brown. They are found in Southeast Asia. They live in tropical forests. They are highly arboreal and rarely come to the ground to feed.

==Species==
Following Ericson &quot;et al.&quot; (2005), the black magpies are placed with the treepies:

<text>Peroxyacetyl nitrate is a peroxyacyl nitrate. It is a secondary pollutant present in photochemical smog. It is thermally unstable and decomposes into peroxyethanoyl radicals and nitrogen dioxide gas. It is a lachrymatory substance, meaning that it irritates the lungs and eyes.

Peroxyacetyl nitrate, or PAN, is an oxidant that is more stable than ozone. Hence, it is more capable of long-range transport than ozone. It serves as a carrier for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) into rural regions and causes ozone formation in the global troposphere.

== Atmospheric chemistry ==
PAN is produced in the atmosphere via photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons to peroxyacetic acid radicals, which react reversibly with nitrogen dioxide () to form PAN. Night-time reaction of acetaldehyde with nitrogen trioxide is another possible source. Since there are no direct emissions, it is a secondary pollutant. Next to ozone and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), it is an important component of photochemical smog.

Further peroxyacyl nitrates in the atmosphere are peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN), peroxybutyryl nitrate (PBN), and peroxybenzoyl nitrate (PBzN). Chlorinated forms have also been observed. PAN is the most important peroxyacyl nitrate. PAN and its homologues reach about 5 to 20 percent of the concentration of ozone in urban areas. At lower temperatures, it is stable and can be transported over long distances, providing nitrogen oxides to otherwise unpolluted areas. At higher temperatures, it decomposes into NO2 and the peroxyacetyl radical.

The decay of PAN in the atmosphere is mainly thermal. Thus, the long-range transport occurs through cold regions of the atmosphere, whereas the decomposition takes place at warmer levels. PAN can also be photolysed by UV radiation. It is a reservoir gas that serves both as a source and a sink of ROx- and NOx radicals. Nitrogen oxides from PAN decomposition enhance ozone production in the lower troposphere.

The natural concentration of PAN in the atmosphere is below 0.1 μg/m3. Measurements in German cities showed values up to 25 μg/m3. Peak values above 200 μg/m3 have been measured in Los Angeles in the second half of the 20th century (1 ppm of PAN corresponds to 4370 μg/m3). Due to the complexity of the measurement setup, only sporadic measurements are available.

PAN is a greenhouse gas.

== Synthesis ==
PAN can be produced in a lipophilic solvent from peroxyacetic acid. For the synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is added to degassed &quot;n&quot;-tridecane and peroxyacetic acid in an ice bath. Next, concentrated nitric acid is added.

As an alternative, PAN can also be synthesized in the gas phase via photolysis of acetone and NO2 with a mercury lamp. Methyl nitrate (CH3ONO2) is created as a by-product.

== Toxicity ==
The toxicity of PAN is higher than that of ozone. Eye irritation from photochemical smog is caused more by PAN and other trace gases than by ozone, which is only sparingly soluble. PAN is a mutagen, and is considered a potential contributor to the development of skin cancer.

<text>Ground-level ozone (O3), also known as surface-level ozone and tropospheric ozone, is a trace gas in the troposphere (the lowest level of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere), with an average concentration of 20–30 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), with close to 100 ppbv in polluted areas. Ozone is also an important constituent of the stratosphere, where the ozone layer (2 to 8 parts per million ozone) exists which is located between 10 and 50 kilometers above the Earth&#x27;s surface. The troposphere extends from the ground up to a variable height of approximately 14 kilometers above sea level. Ozone is least concentrated in the ground layer (or planetary boundary layer) of the troposphere. Ground-level or tropospheric ozone is created by chemical reactions between NOx gases (oxides of nitrogen produced by combustion) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The combination of these chemicals in the presence of sunlight form ozone. Its concentration increases as height above sea level increases, with a maximum concentration at the tropopause. About 90% of total ozone in the atmosphere is in the stratosphere, and 10% is in the troposphere. Although ground-level ozone is less concentrated than stratospheric ozone, it is of concern because of its health effects. Ozone in the troposphere is considered a greenhouse gas, and as such contribute to global warming. as reported in IPCC reports. Actually, tropospheric ozone is considered the third most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and CH4, as indicated by estimates of its radiative forcing.

Photochemical and chemical reactions involving ozone drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the troposphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations (the largest source being emissions from combustion of fossil fuels), it is a pollutant, and a constituent of smog. Its levels have increased significantly since the industrial revolution, as NOx gasses and VOCs are some of the byproducts of combustion. With more heat and sunlight in the summer months, more ozone is formed which is why regions often experience higher levels of pollution in the summer months. Although the same molecule, ground-level ozone can be harmful to human health, unlike stratospheric ozone that protects the earth from excess UV radiation.

Photolysis of ozone occurs at wavelengths below approximately 310–320 nanometres. This reaction initiates a chain of chemical reactions that remove carbon monoxide, methane, and other hydrocarbons from the atmosphere via oxidation. Therefore, the concentration of tropospheric ozone affects how long these compounds remain in the air. If the oxidation of carbon monoxide or methane occur in the presence of nitrogen monoxide (NO), this chain of reactions has a net product of ozone added to the system.

==Measurement==
Ozone in the atmosphere can be measured by remote sensing technology, or by &quot;in-situ&quot; monitoring technology. Because ozone absorbs light in the UV spectrum, the most common way to measure ozone is to measure how much of this light spectrum is absorbed in the atmosphere. Because the stratosphere has higher ozone concentration than the troposphere, it is important for remote sensing instruments to be able to determine altitude along with the concentration measurements. A &quot;total ozone mapping spectrometer-earth probe &quot; (TOMS-EP) aboard a satellite from NASA is an example of an ozone layer measuring satellite, and the &quot;tropospheric emission spectrometer&quot; (TES) is an example of an ozone measuring satellite that is specifically for the troposphere. LIDAR is a common ground-based remote sensing technique that uses laser to measure ozone. The &quot;Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network&quot; (TOLNet) is the network of ozone observing lidars across the United States.

Ozonesondes are a form of &quot;in situ&quot;, or local ozone measuring instruments. An ozonesonde is attached to a meteorological balloon, so that the instrument can directly measure ozone concentration at the varying altitudes along the balloon&#x27;s upward path. The information collected from the instrument attached to the balloon is transmitted back using radiosonde technology. NOAA has worked to create a global network of tropospheric ozone measurements using ozonesondes.

Ozone is also measured in air quality environmental monitoring networks. In these networks, in-situ ozone monitors based on ozone&#x27;s UV-absorption properties are used to measure ppb-levels in ambient air.

Total atmospheric ozone (sometimes seen in weather reports) is measured in a column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, and is dominated by high concentrations of stratospheric ozone. Typical units of measure for this purpose include the Dobson unit and millimoles per square meter (mmol/m2).

==Formation==
The majority of ground-level ozone formation occurs when nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), react in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight, specifically the UV spectrum. NOx, CO, and VOCs are considered ozone precursors. Motor vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and chemical solvents are the major anthropogenic sources of these ozone precursors. Although the ozone precursors often originate in urban areas, winds can carry NOx hundreds of kilometers, causing ozone formation to occur in less populated regions as well. Methane, a VOC whose atmospheric concentration has increased tremendously during the last century, contributes to ozone formation but on a global scale rather than in local or regional photochemical smog episodes. In situations where this exclusion of methane from the VOC group of substances is not obvious, the term non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) is often used.

Indoors ozone is produced by certain high-voltage electric devices (such as air ionizers) and as a by-product of other types of pollution. Outdoor air used for ventilation may have sufficient ozone to react with common indoor pollutants as well as skin oils and other common indoor air chemicals or surfaces. Particular concern is warranted when using &quot;green&quot; cleaning products based on citrus or terpene extracts, because these chemicals react very quickly with ozone to form toxic and irritating chemicals as well as fine and ultrafine particles.

The chemical reactions involved in ground-level ozone formation are a series of complex cycles in which carbon monoxide and VOCs are oxidised to water vapour and carbon dioxide. The reactions involved in this process are illustrated here with CO but similar reactions occur for VOC as well. The oxidation begins with the reaction of CO with the hydroxyl radical (•OH). The radical intermediate formed by this reacts rapidly with oxygen to give a peroxy radical •

An outline of the chain reaction that occurs in oxidation of CO, producing O3:

The reaction begins with the oxidation of CO by the hydroxyl radical (•OH). The radical adduct (•HOCO) is unstable and reacts rapidly with oxygen to give a peroxy radical, HO2•:
: •OH + CO → •HOCO
: •HOCO + O2 → HO2• + CO2

Peroxy-radicals then go on to react with NO to produce NO2, which is photolysed by UV-A radiation to give a ground-state atomic oxygen, which then reacts with molecular oxygen to form ozone.
: HO2• + NO → •OH + NO2
: NO2 + hν → NO + O(3P), λ&lt;400 nm
: O(3P) + O2 → O3
: &quot;note that these three reactions are what forms the ozone molecule, and will occur the same way in the oxidation of CO or VOCs case.&quot;

The net reaction in this case is then:
:CO + 2 → + 

The amount of ozone produced through these reactions in ambient air can be estimated using a modified Leighton relationship. The limit on these interrelated cycles producing ozone is the reaction of •OH with NO2 to form nitric acid at high NOx levels. If nitrogen monoxide (NO) is instead present at very low levels in the atmosphere (less than 10 approximately ppt), the peroxy radicals (HO2• ) formed from the oxidation will instead react with themselves to form peroxides, and not produce ozone.

==Health effects==

Health effects depend on ozone precursors, which is a group of pollutants, primarily generated during the combustion of fossil fuels. Ground-level ozone is created by nitrous oxides reacting with organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. There are many man-made sources of these organic compounds including vehicle and industrial emissions, along with several other sources. Reaction with daylight ultraviolet (UV) rays and these precursors create ground-level ozone pollution. Ozone is known to have the following health effects at concentrations common in urban air:
* Irritation of the respiratory system, causing coughing, throat irritation, and/or an uncomfortable sensation in the chest. Ozone affects people with underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer as well those who spend a lot of time being active outdoors.
* Reduced lung function, making it more difficult to breathe deeply and vigorously. Breathing may become more rapid and more shallow than normal, and a person&#x27;s ability to engage in vigorous activities may be limited. Ozone causes the muscles in the airways to constrict which traps air in the alveoli leading to wheezing and shortness of breath.
* Aggravation of asthma. When ozone levels are high, more people with asthma have attacks that require a doctor&#x27;s attention or use of medication. One reason this happens is that ozone makes people more sensitive to allergens, which in turn trigger asthma attacks.
* Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Examples of these respiratory complications include bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.
* Inflammation and damage to the lining of the lungs. Within a few days, the damaged cells are shed and replaced much like the skin peels after a sunburn. Animal studies suggest that if this type of inflammation happens repeatedly over a long time period (months, years, a lifetime), lung tissue may become permanently scarred, resulting in permanent loss of lung function and a lower quality of life.
*More recent data suggests that ozone can also have harmful effects via the inflammatory pathway leading to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.

It was observed in the 1990s that ground-level ozone can advance death by a few days in predisposed and vulnerable populations. A statistical study of 95 large urban communities in the United States found significant association between ozone levels and premature death. The study estimated that a one-third reduction in urban ozone concentrations would save roughly 4000 lives per year (Bell et al., 2004). Ground-level ozone causes approximately 22,000 premature deaths per year in 25 countries in the European Union. (WHO, 2008)

==Problem areas==

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has developed an Air Quality index to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8-hour average ozone mole fractions of 76 to 95 nmol/mol are described as &quot;Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups&quot;, 96 nmol/mol to 115 nmol/mol as unhealthy and 116 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as very unhealthy. The EPA has designated over 300 counties of the United States, clustered around the most heavily populated areas (especially in California and the Northeast), as failing to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

In 2000, the Ozone Annex was added to the U.S.–Canada Air Quality Agreement. The Ozone Annex addresses transboundary air pollution that contributes to ground-level ozone, which contributes to smog. The main goal was to attain proper ozone air quality standards in both countries. The North Front Range of Colorado has been out of compliance with the Federal Air Quality standards. The U.S. EPA designated Fort Collins as part of the ozone non-attainment area in November 2007. This means that the U.S.&#x27;s environmental law considers the air quality to be worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments. In 2024, the Lung Association ranked Fort Collins 16th in the nation for high ozone days out of 228 metropolitan areas, 38 for 24-hour particle pollution out of 223 metropolitan areas, and 136 for annual particle pollution out of 204 metropolitan areas.

In monitoring air quality, Boulder County, Colorado is classified by the EPA as part of a nine-county group that includes the Denver metro area and North Front Range region. This nine-county zone has recorded ozone levels that exceed the EPA&#x27;s ozone standard since 2004. Attempts have been made under the Early Action Compact to bring the area&#x27;s air quality up to the EPA&#x27;s standards. However, since 2004 ozone pollution in Boulder County has regularly failed to meet federal standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The County of Boulder continues trying to alleviate some of the ozone pollution through programming that encourages people to drive less, and stop ozone polluting activities during the heat of the day.

==Ozone and the climate==
Ground-level ozone is both naturally occurring and anthropogenically formed. It is the primary constituent of urban smog, forming naturally as a secondary pollutant through photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the presence of bright sunshine with high temperatures.

Regardless of whether it occurs naturally or is anthropogenically formed, the change in ozone concentrations in the upper troposphere will:
* exert a considerable impact on global warming, because it is a key air pollutant and greenhouse gas, and
* impact the production of surface level ozone (contributing again to climate change).

As a result, photochemical smog pollution at the earth&#x27;s surface, as well as stratospheric ozone depletion, have received a lot of attention in recent years. The disruptions in the &quot;free troposphere&quot; are likely to be the focus of the next cycle of scientific concern. In several parts of the northern hemisphere, tropospheric ozone levels have been rising. On various scales, this may have an impact on moisture levels, cloud volume and dispersion, precipitation, and atmospheric dynamics. A rising environment, on the other hand, favours ozone synthesis and accumulation in the atmosphere, owing to two physicochemical mechanisms. First, a warming climate alters humidity and wind conditions in some parts of the world, resulting in a reduction in the frequency of surface cyclones.

===Climate change impacts on processes that affect ozone===
Changes in air temperature and water content affect the air&#x27;s chemistry and the rates of chemical reactions that create and remove ozone. Many chemical reaction rates increase with temperature and lead to increased ozone production. Climate change projections show that rising temperatures and water vapour in the atmosphere will likely increase surface ozone in polluted areas like the eastern United States. In particular, the degradation of the pollutant peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), which is a significant reservoir species for long-range transport of ozone precursors, is accelerated by rising temperatures. As a result, as the temperature rises, the lifetime of PAN reduces, changing the long-range transport of ozone pollution. Second, the same radiative forcing that causes global warming would chill the stratosphere. This cooling is projected to result in a relative rise in ozone (O3) depletion in the polar region, as well as an increase in the frequency of ozone holes.

Ozone depletion, on the other hand, is a radiative forcing of the climate system. Two opposite effects exist: Reduced ozone causes the stratosphere to absorb less solar radiation, cooling it while warming the troposphere; as a result, the stratosphere emits less long-wave radiation downward, cooling the troposphere. The IPCC believes that &quot;measured stratospheric O3 losses over the past two decades have generated a negative forcing of the surface-troposphere system&quot; of around 0.15 0.10 watts per square metre (W/m2). Furthermore, rising air temperatures often improve ozone-forming processes, which has a repercussion on climate, as well.

Ozone production rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less ozone. It is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants could be responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006. A similar investigation to assess the joint effects of ozone and heat during the European heat waves in 2003, concluded that these appear to be additive.

In the Arctic, due to climate change, &quot;the sea ice that lasts from one winter to the next is decreasing. This has created a larger area of melted ice, and more ice that comes and goes with the seasons. This seasonal variation in ice &quot;could&quot; release more molecular chlorine into the atmosphere.&quot; &quot;The level of molecular chlorine above Barrow was measured as high as 400 parts per trillion.&quot; &quot;The ultimate source of the molecular chlorine is the sodium chloride in sea salt, most likely from the snow-covered ice pack. How the sea salt is transformed into molecular chlorine is unknown.&quot; The molecular chlorine reacts with UV radiation, producing highly reactive chlorine radicals that expedite the degradation of methane and tropospheric ozone, and oxidize mercury into more toxic forms.

<text>USS &quot;Long Island&quot; (CVE-1) (originally AVG-1 and then ACV-1) was lead ship of her class and the first escort carrier of the United States Navy. She was also the second ship to be named after Long Island, New York.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Long Island&quot; was laid down on 7 July 1939, as the C-3 cargo liner &quot;Mormacmail&quot;, under Maritime Commission contract, by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania as Yard No 185, launched on 11 January 1940, sponsored by Ms. Dian B. Holt, acquired by the Navy on 6 March 1941, and commissioned on 2 June 1941, Commander Donald B. Duncan in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
In the tense months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Long Island&quot; operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, conducting experiments to prove the feasibility of aircraft operations from converted cargo ships. The data gathered by her crew greatly improved the combat readiness of later &quot;baby flattops&quot;. Just after the Japanese attack, she escorted a convoy to Newfoundland and qualified carrier pilots at Norfolk before departing for the West Coast on 10 May 1942. Reaching San Francisco on 5 June, the ship immediately joined Admiral William S. Pye&#x27;s Task Force One (TF 1); consisting of seven battleships and provided air cover while at sea to protect the West Coast of the United States and reinforce Admiral Chester Nimitz&#x27;s forces before, during and after their victory in the Battle of Midway. She left the formation on 17 June and returned to the West Coast to resume carrier pilot training.

&quot;Long Island&quot; departed San Diego on 8 July and arrived Pearl Harbor on 17 July. After a training run south to Palmyra Island, she loaded two squadrons of Marine Corps aircraft and got underway for the South Pacific on 2 August. Touching at Fiji on 13 August, she then steamed to a point southeast of Guadalcanal and launched her aircraft (19 Grumman F4F Wildcats and 12 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers). These planes, the first to reach Henderson Field, were instrumental in the Guadalcanal campaign and went on to compile a distinguished war record. Her mission was accomplished. Reclassified ACV-1 on 20 August, &quot;Long Island&quot; sailed for Vila, Efate Island, New Hebrides, and arrived on 17 August. She departed on 18 August but returned to Vila, on Efate, from 23 August to 31 August. She sailed on 1 September for Espiritu Santo, before departing from there the same day for San Diego.
&quot;Long Island&quot;″s actions at Guadalcanal are mentioned and seen in the movie &quot;Flying Leathernecks&quot;.

&quot;Long Island&quot; returned to the West Coast on 20 September, as the new &quot;baby flattops&quot; took up the slack in the Pacific war zones. For the next year, the escort carrier trained carrier pilots at San Diego. &quot;Long Island&quot; was reclassified CVE-1 on 15 July 1943. In 1944–1945, she transported airplanes and their crews from the West Coast to various outposts in the Pacific. After V-J Day, she revisited many of these same bases while transporting soldiers and sailors back home during Operation Magic Carpet.

===Post-war===

&quot;Long Island&quot; decommissioned on 26 March 1946 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 April, she was sold to Zidell Ship Dismantling Company of Portland, Oregon on 24 April 1947 for scrapping. However, on 12 March 1948, she was acquired by the Canada-Europe Line for conversion to merchant service. Upon completion of conversion in 1949, she was renamed &quot;Nelly&quot;, and served as an immigrant carrier between Europe, Australia and Canada. In 1953, she was renamed &quot;Seven Seas&quot;. In 1955, she was chartered to the German Europe-Canada Line. On 17 July 1965, she had a serious fire and was towed to St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. She was repaired and started her last voyage on 13 September 1966. She was bought the same year and employed by Rotterdam University as a students&#x27; hostel until 1971 and as a migrant hostel until 1977, when she was scrapped in Belgium.

==Awards==
&quot;Long Island&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service.

<doc id="215055" wikidata="Q905782" url="?curid=215055" title="Disodium inosinate">
<text>Disodium inosinate (E631) is the disodium salt of inosinic acid with the chemical formula C10H11N4Na2O8P. It is used as a food additive and often found in instant noodles, potato chips, and a variety of other snacks.

Commercial disodium inosinate may either be obtained from bacterial fermentation of sugars or prepared from animal products. The Vegetarian Society reports that production from meat or fish is more widespread, but the Vegetarian Resource Group reports that all three &quot;leading manufacturers&quot; claim to use fermentation.

==Use as a food additive==
Disodium inosinate is used as a flavor enhancer, in synergy with monosodium glutamate (MSG) to provide the umami taste. It is often added to foods in conjunction with disodium guanylate; the combination is known as disodium 5′-ribonucleotides.

As a relatively expensive product, disodium inosinate is usually not used independently of glutamic acid; if disodium inosinate is present in a list of ingredients, but MSG does not appear to be, it is possible that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient or is naturally occurring in another ingredient like tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, or yeast extract.

==Origin==
Inosinate is naturally found in meat and fish at levels of 80–800 mg/100 g. It can also be made by fermentation of sugars such as tapioca starch.

Some sources claim that industrial levels of production are achieved by extraction from animal products, making E631 non-vegetarian. However, an interview by the Vegetarian Resource Group reports that all three &quot;leading manufacturers&quot; (one being Ajinomoto) claims to use an all-vegetarian fermentation process. Producers are generally open to providing information on the origin. E631 is in some cases labeled as &quot;vegetarian&quot; in ingredients lists when produced from plant sources.

== Toxicology and safety ==
In the United States, consumption of added 5′-ribonucleotides averages 4 mg per day, compared to 2 g per day of naturally occurring purines. A review of literature by an FDA committee found no evidence of carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, or adverse effects on reproduction.

In 2004, disodium inosinate was proposed to be removed from the food additive list by Codex Alimentarius Commission. This change did not go through: it is still present in the 2009 Codex Alimentarius list.

<doc id="215056" wikidata="Q1199125" url="?curid=215056" title="Repunit">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a repunit is a number like 11, 111, or 1111 that contains only the digit 1 — a more specific type of repdigit. The term stands for &quot;repeated unit&quot; and was coined in 1966 by Albert H. Beiler in his book &quot;Recreations in the Theory of Numbers&quot;.

A repunit prime is a repunit that is also a prime number. Primes that are repunits in base-2 are Mersenne primes. As of October 2024, the largest known prime number , the largest probable prime &quot;R&quot;8177207 and the largest elliptic curve primality-proven prime &quot;R&quot;86453 are all repunits in various bases.

== Definition ==

The base-&quot;b&quot; repunits are defined as (this &quot;b&quot; can be either positive or negative)
:formula_1
Thus, the number &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) consists of &quot;n&quot; copies of the digit 1 in base-&quot;b&quot; representation. The first two repunits base-&quot;b&quot; for &quot;n&quot; = 1 and &quot;n&quot; = 2 are 
:formula_2

In particular, the &quot;decimal (base-&quot;10&quot;) repunits&quot; that are often referred to as simply &quot;repunits&quot; are defined as
:formula_3
Thus, the number &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(10) consists of &quot;n&quot; copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base-10 starts with
: 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, ... .

Similarly, the repunits base-2 are defined as
:formula_4
Thus, the number &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(2) consists of &quot;n&quot; copies of the digit 1 in base-2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known Mersenne numbers &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; − 1, they start with
:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... .

== Properties ==
* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite. For example,
*: &quot;R&quot;35(&quot;b&quot;) = = × 1 = × 1,
:since 35 = 7 × 5 = 5 × 7. This repunit factorization does not depend on the base-&quot;b&quot; in which the repunit is expressed.
:Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits can be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition. For example,
:: &quot;R&quot;11(2) = 211 − 1 = 2047 = 23 × 89.
* If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime, then every prime &quot;q&quot; that divides &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2&quot;p,&quot; or a factor of &quot;b&quot; − 1. For example, a prime factor of &quot;R&quot;29 is 62003 = 1 + 2·29·1069. The reason is that the prime &quot;p&quot; is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that &quot;q&quot; divides &quot;bp&quot; − 1, because &quot;p&quot; is prime. Therefore, unless &quot;q&quot; divides &quot;b&quot; − 1, &quot;p&quot; divides the Carmichael function of &quot;q&quot;, which is even and equal to &quot;q&quot; − 1. 
*Any positive multiple of the repunit &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) contains at least &quot;n&quot; nonzero digits in base-&quot;b&quot;.
* Any number &quot;x&quot; is a two-digit repunit in base x − 1.
* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base-5, 11111 in base-2) and 8191 (111 in base-90, 1111111111111 in base-2). The Goormaghtigh conjecture says there are only these two cases.
* Using the pigeon-hole principle it can be easily shown that for relatively prime natural numbers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, there exists a repunit in base-&quot;b&quot; that is a multiple of &quot;n&quot;. To see this consider repunits &quot;R&quot;1(&quot;b&quot;)...,&quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;). Because there are &quot;n&quot; repunits but only &quot;n&quot;−1 non-zero residues modulo &quot;n&quot; there exist two repunits &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;R&quot;&quot;j&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) with 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;R&quot;&quot;j&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) have the same residue modulo &quot;n&quot;. It follows that &quot;R&quot;&quot;j&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) − &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) has residue 0 modulo &quot;n&quot;, i.e. is divisible by &quot;n&quot;. Since &quot;R&quot;&quot;j&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) − &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) consists of &quot;j&quot; − &quot;i&quot; ones followed by &quot;i&quot; zeroes, . Now &quot;n&quot; divides the left-hand side of this equation, so it also divides the right-hand side, but since &quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are relatively prime, &quot;n&quot; must divide &quot;R&quot;&quot;j&quot;−&quot;i&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).
* The Feit–Thompson conjecture is that &quot;R&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) never divides &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) for two distinct primes &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.
* Using the Euclidean Algorithm for repunits definition: &quot;R&quot;1(&quot;b&quot;) = 1; &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;b&quot;) × &quot;b&quot; + 1, any consecutive repunits &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) are relatively prime in any base-&quot;b&quot; for any &quot;n&quot;.
* If &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; have a common divisor &quot;d&quot;, &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) have the common divisor &quot;R&quot;&quot;d&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) in any base-&quot;b&quot; for any &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a strong divisibility sequence. As a consequence, If &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are relatively prime, &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) and &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;m&quot; − &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) for &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. Similarly, using &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) − &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) × &quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot;−&quot;n&quot; = &quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;−&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;), it can be easily shown that &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;), &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;−&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;), &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) for &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, if &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;R&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;), &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;Rd&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).

== Factorization of decimal repunits ==

(Prime factors colored means &quot;new factors&quot;, i. e. the prime factor divides &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; but does not divide &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot; for all &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;) 

Smallest prime factor of &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 are
:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... 

==Repunit primes==
The definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for prime factors of such numbers.

It is easy to show that if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) is divisible by &quot;R&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;b&quot;):

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the formula_7 cyclotomic polynomial and &quot;d&quot; ranges over the divisors of &quot;n&quot;. For &quot;p&quot; prime,

:formula_8

which has the expected form of a repunit when &quot;x&quot; is substituted with &quot;b&quot;.

For example, 9 is divisible by 3, and thus &quot;R&quot;9 is divisible by &quot;R&quot;3—in fact, 111111111 = 111 · 1001001. The corresponding cyclotomic polynomials formula_9 and formula_10 are formula_11 and formula_12, respectively. Thus, for &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; to be prime, &quot;n&quot; must necessarily be prime, but it is not sufficient for &quot;n&quot; to be prime. For example, &quot;R&quot;3 = 111 = 3 · 37 is not prime. Except for this case of &quot;R&quot;3, &quot;p&quot; can only divide &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; for prime &quot;n&quot; if &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;kn&quot; + 1 for some &quot;k&quot;.

=== Decimal repunit primes ===
&quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; is prime for &quot;n&quot; = 2, 19, 23, 317, 1031, 49081, 86453 ... (sequence in OEIS). On April 3, 2007 Harvey Dubner (who also found &quot;R&quot;49081) announced that &quot;R&quot;109297 is a probable prime. On July 15, 2007, Maksym Voznyy announced &quot;R&quot;270343 to be probably prime. Serge Batalov and Ryan Propper found &quot;R&quot;5794777 and &quot;R&quot;8177207 to be probable primes on April 20 and May 8, 2021, respectively. As of their discovery each was the largest known probable prime. On March 22, 2022 probable prime &quot;R&quot;49081 was eventually proven to be a prime. On May 15, 2023 probable prime &quot;R&quot;86453 was eventually proven to be a prime.

It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many repunit primes and they seem to occur roughly as often as the prime number theorem would predict: the exponent of the &quot;N&quot;th repunit prime is generally around a fixed multiple of the exponent of the (&quot;N&quot;−1)th.

The prime repunits are a trivial subset of the permutable primes, i.e., primes that remain prime after any permutation of their digits.

Particular properties are

*The remainder of &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; modulo 3 is equal to the remainder of &quot;n&quot; modulo 3. Using 10&quot;a&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 3) for any &quot;a&quot; ≥ 0,&quot;n&quot; ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ 0 (mod &quot;R&quot;3),&quot;n&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ &quot;R&quot;1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;R&quot;3),&quot;n&quot; ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ &quot;R&quot;2 ≡ 11 (mod &quot;R&quot;3).Therefore, 3 | &quot;n&quot; ⇔ 3 | &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⇔ &quot;R&quot;3 | &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
* The remainder of &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; modulo 9 is equal to the remainder of &quot;n&quot; modulo 9. Using 10&quot;a&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 9) for any &quot;a&quot; ≥ 0,&quot;n&quot; ≡ &quot;r&quot; (mod 9) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ &quot;r&quot; (mod 9) ⇔ &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≡ &quot;R&quot;&quot;r&quot; (mod &quot;R&quot;9),for 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; &lt; 9.Therefore, 9 | &quot;n&quot; ⇔ 9 | &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⇔ &quot;R&quot;9 | &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

=== Algebra factorization of generalized repunit numbers ===
If &quot;b&quot; is a perfect power (can be written as &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot;, with &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; integers, &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1) differs from 1, then there is at most one repunit in base-&quot;b&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is a prime power (can be written as &quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot;, with &quot;p&quot; prime, &quot;r&quot; integer, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot; &gt;0), then all repunit in base-&quot;b&quot; are not prime aside from &quot;Rp&quot; and &quot;R2&quot;. &quot;Rp&quot; can be either prime or composite, the former examples, &quot;b&quot; = −216, −128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, &quot;b&quot; = −243, −125, −64, −32, −27, −8, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and &quot;R2&quot; can be prime (when &quot;p&quot; differs from 2) only if &quot;b&quot; is negative, a power of −2, for example, &quot;b&quot; = −8, −32, −128, −8192, etc., in fact, the &quot;R2&quot; can also be composite, for example, &quot;b&quot; = −512, −2048, −32768, etc. If &quot;n&quot; is not a prime power, then no base-&quot;b&quot; repunit prime exists, for example, &quot;b&quot; = 64, 729 (with &quot;n&quot; = 6), &quot;b&quot; = 1024 (with &quot;n&quot; = 10), and &quot;b&quot; = −1 or 0 (with &quot;n&quot; any natural number). Another special situation is &quot;b&quot; = −4&quot;k&quot;4, with &quot;k&quot; positive integer, which has the aurifeuillean factorization, for example, &quot;b&quot; = −4 (with &quot;k&quot; = 1, then &quot;R2&quot; and &quot;R3&quot; are primes), and &quot;b&quot; = −64, −324, −1024, −2500, −5184, ... (with &quot;k&quot; = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...), then no base-&quot;b&quot; repunit prime exists. It is also conjectured that when &quot;b&quot; is neither a perfect power nor −4&quot;k&quot;4 with &quot;k&quot; positive integer, then there are infinity many base-&quot;b&quot; repunit primes.

=== The generalized repunit conjecture ===

A conjecture related to the generalized repunit primes: (the conjecture predicts where is the next generalized Mersenne prime, if the conjecture is true, then there are infinitely many repunit primes for all bases formula_13)

For any integer formula_13, which satisfies the conditions:

# formula_15.
# formula_13 is not a perfect power. (since when formula_13 is a perfect formula_18th power, it can be shown that there is at most one formula_19 value such that formula_20 is prime, and this formula_19 value is formula_18 itself or a root of formula_18)
# formula_13 is not in the form formula_25. (if so, then the number has aurifeuillean factorization)

has generalized repunit primes of the form

:formula_26

for prime formula_27, the prime numbers will be distributed near the best fit line

:formula_28

where limit formula_29, formula_30

and there are about

:formula_31

base-&quot;b&quot; repunit primes less than &quot;N&quot;.

*formula_32 is the base of natural logarithm.
*formula_33 is Euler–Mascheroni constant.
*formula_34 is the logarithm in base formula_35
*formula_36 is the formula_19th generalized repunit prime in base&quot;b&quot; (with prime &quot;p&quot;)
*formula_38 is a data fit constant which varies with formula_13.
*formula_40 if formula_41, formula_42 if formula_43.
*formula_44 is the largest natural number such that formula_45 is a formula_46th power.

We also have the following 3 properties:

# The number of prime numbers of the form formula_20 (with prime formula_27) less than or equal to formula_19 is about formula_50.
# The expected number of prime numbers of the form formula_20 with prime formula_27 between formula_19 and formula_54 is about formula_55. 
# The probability that number of the form formula_20 is prime (for prime formula_27) is about formula_58.

==History==
Although they were not then known by that name, repunits in base-10 were studied by many mathematicians during the nineteenth century in an effort to work out and predict the cyclic patterns of repeating decimals.

It was found very early on that for any prime &quot;p&quot; greater than 5, the period of the decimal expansion of 1/&quot;p&quot; is equal to the length of the smallest repunit number that is divisible by &quot;p&quot;. Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the factorization by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to &quot;R16&quot; and many larger ones. By 1880, even &quot;R17&quot; to &quot;R36&quot; had been factored and it is curious that, though Édouard Lucas showed no prime below three million had period nineteen, there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved &quot;R19&quot; to be prime in 1916 and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found &quot;R23&quot; to be prime in 1929.

Further advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. &quot;R317&quot; was found to be a probable prime circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when &quot;R1031&quot; was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.

Since 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.

The Cunningham project endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.

== Demlo numbers ==
D. R. Kaprekar has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit. 
They are named after Demlo railway station (now called Dombivili) 30 miles from Bombay on the then G.I.P. Railway, where Kaprekar started investigating them.
He calls &quot;Wonderful Demlo numbers&quot; those of the form 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ..., 12345678987654321. The fact that these are the squares of the repunits has led some authors to call Demlo numbers the infinite sequence of these, 1, 121, 12321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ..., , although one can check these are not Demlo numbers for &quot;p&quot; = 10, 19, 28, ...

<doc id="215060" wikidata="Q727732" url="?curid=215060" title="Organic sulfide">
<text>In organic chemistry, a sulfide (British English sulphide) or thioether is an organosulfur functional group with the connectivity as shown on right. Like many other sulfur-containing compounds, volatile sulfides have foul odors. A sulfide is similar to an ether except that it contains a sulfur atom in place of the oxygen. The grouping of oxygen and sulfur in the periodic table suggests that the chemical properties of ethers and sulfides are somewhat similar, though the extent to which this is true in practice varies depending on the application.

==Nomenclature==
Sulfides are sometimes called thioethers, especially in the old literature. The two organic substituents are indicated by the prefixes. (CH3)2S is called dimethylsulfide. Some sulfides are named by modifying the common name for the corresponding ether. For example, C6H5SCH3 is methyl phenyl sulfide, but is more commonly called thioanisole, since its structure is related to that for anisole, C6H5OCH3.

The modern systematic nomenclature in chemistry for the trival name thioether is &quot;sulfane&quot;.

==Structure and properties==
Sulfide is an angular functional group, the C–S–C angle approaching 90° The C–S bonds are about 180 pm.
For the prototype, dimethylsulfide, the C-S-C angles is 99°, which is smaller than the C-O-C angle in ether (~110°). The C-S distance in dimethylsulfide is 1.81 Å.

Sulfides are characterized by their strong odors, which are similar to thiol odor. This odor limits the applications of volatile sulfides. In terms of their physical properties they resemble ethers, but are less volatile, higher melting, and less hydrophilic. These properties follow from the polarizability of the divalent sulfur center, which is greater than that for oxygen in ethers.

===Thiophenes===
Thiophenes are a special class of sulfide-containing heterocyclic compounds. Because of their aromatic character, they are non-nucleophilic. The nonbonding electrons on sulfur are delocalized into the π-system. As a consequence, thiophene exhibits few properties expected for a sulfide – thiophene is non-nucleophilic at sulfur and, in fact, is sweet-smelling. Upon hydrogenation, thiophene gives tetrahydrothiophene, C4H8S, which indeed does behave as a typical sulfide.

==Occurrence and applications==
Sulfides are important in biology, notably in the amino acid methionine and the cofactor biotin. Petroleum contains many organosulfur compounds, including sulfides. Polyphenylene sulfide is a useful high temperature plastic. Coenzyme M, , is the precursor to methane (i.e. natural gas) via the process of methanogenesis.
==Preparation==
Sulfides are typically prepared by alkylation of thiols. Alkylating agents include not only alkyl halides, but also epoxides, aziridines, and Michael acceptors.
Such reactions are usually conducted in the presence of a base, which converts the thiol into the more nucleophilic thiolate. Analogously, the reaction of disulfides with organolithium reagents produces thioethers:
Analogous reactions are known starting with Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, sulfides can be synthesized by the addition of a thiol to an alkene in the thiol-ene reaction:
This reaction is often catalysed by free radicals produced from a photoinitiator.

Sulfides can also be prepared by many other methods, such as the Pummerer rearrangement. Trialkysulfonium salts react with nucleophiles with a dialkyl sulfide as a leaving group:
This reaction is exploited in biological systems as a means of transferring an alkyl group. For example, &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine acts as a methylating agent in biological SN2 reactions.

An unusual but well tested method for the synthesis of thioethers involves addition of alkenes, especially ethylene across the S-Cl bond of sulfur dichloride. This method has been used in the production of bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide, a mustard gas:

==Reactions==
The Lewis basic lone pairs on sulfur dominate the sulfides&#x27; reactivity. Sulfides readily alkylate to stable sulfonium salts, such as trimethylsulfonium iodide:
Sulfides also oxidize easily to sulfoxides (), which can themselves be further oxidized to sulfones (). Hydrogen peroxide is a typical oxidant—for example, with dimethyl sulfide ():
:

In analogy to their easy alkylation, sulfides bind to metals to form thioether complexes. Consequently, Lewis acids do not decompose thioethers as they do ethers. Sulfides are soft ligands, but their affinity for metals is lower than typical phosphines. Chelating thioethers are known, such as 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane.

Sulfides undergo hydrogenolysis in the presence of certain metals:
Raney nickel is useful for stoichiometric reactions in organic synthesis whereas molybdenum-based catalysts are used to &quot;sweeten&quot; petroleum fractions, in the process called hydrodesulfurization. Similarly dissolving metal reductions can induce dealkylation or dearylation.

Unlike ethers, thioethers are stable in the presence of Grignard reagents. The protons adjacent to the sulfur atom are labile, and can be deprotonated with strong bases.
