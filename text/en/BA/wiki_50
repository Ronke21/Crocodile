<text>Fair City is an Irish television soap opera which has been broadcast on RTÉ One since 1989. Produced by the public service broadcaster RTE, it first aired on Monday, 18 September 1989. It has won several awards and is both the most popular and the longest running Irish drama serial.

Plots centre on the domestic and professional lives of the residents of Carrigstown, a fictional suburb of the Northside part of the city of Dublin. The area encompasses a restaurant, pub, garage, corner shop, community centre, charity shop, surgery, boxing club (Esker/Carrigstown Boxing Club) and various businesses. Originally aired as one half-hour episode per week for a limited run, the show is now broadcast year round on RTÉ One in three episodes per week, all of which air at 20:00.

&quot;Fair City&quot; is the most watched drama in Ireland, with average viewing figures of 550,000. Devised by executive producer Margaret Gleeson and series producer Paul Cusack, it has remained a significant programme in terms of RTÉ&#x27;s success and audience share, and also in the history of Irish television drama, tackling many controversial and taboo issues previously unseen on Irish television, such as rape.

==Setting==
&quot;Fair City&quot; is set in Carrigstown, a fictional suburb of the Northside part of the city of Dublin. &quot;Carrick&quot; is found in many real Irish locations (for instance: Carrickmacross, Carrickfergus, Carrick-on-Shannon, Carrick-on-Suir), and is derived from the Irish-language word &quot;carraig&quot;, meaning &quot;rock&quot;. Many of the scenes take place around the main street in Carrigstown, with notable landmarks on the street including McCoy&#x27;s pub, Phelan&#x27;s corner shop (now Spar, formerly Doyle&#x27;s), The Hungry Pig (formerly The Bistro), the Community Centre (formerly The Haven) and Vino&#x27;s (formerly Rainbows Sandwich Bar). Other recurring settings include the Acorn Cabs dispatch centre, the shared office, the Helping Hand charity shop, the surgery and most recently the Peggy Tea coffee shop.

According to the &quot;RTÉ Guide&quot;, Carrigstown is bounded by Drumcondra to the north, the city centre to the south, East Wall to the east and Phibsboro to the west. Carrigstown takes its name from the village that grew up around the quarries in which granite was mined until the early 20th century – &quot;carraig&quot;, as noted above, being the Irish-language word for &quot;rock&quot;.

&quot;Fair City&quot; occasionally makes use of real Dublin locations, such as Grafton Street, the Natural History Museum and Dublin Zoo. In 2011, filming took place for the first time outside of Dublin at the National Ploughing Championships. For the 1989 Dublin City Marathon, actors filmed short scenes taking part in the marathon that were edited into the programme in the following episode.

==Characters==

The series was originally focused on four families: the O&#x27;Hanlons, the Kellys, the Clarkes and the Doyles. Some of the earlier characters also included Lily Corcoran, her womanising nephew, Jack Flynn, Paul Brennan, now a billionaire, at the time worked for Jack Flynn, and Linda O&#x27;Malley, an acquaintance of Jack&#x27;s, to whom he had promised fame as a singer.

During the 1990s, the Phelan, Doyle, and Molloy families were introduced and dominated storylines for that decade. Bela and Rita Doyle, along with their brood of six children and Rita&#x27;s mother Hannah, were involved in many stories. The Phelan family originally consisted of Hughie and Natalie, but later a new branch of the family arrived including Hughie&#x27;s mother Eunice, and his brother Christy, along with Christy&#x27;s wife Renee, and their two children Floyd and Farrah. The Molloy family was introduced in the mid-1990s and consisted of patriarch Harry, his wife Dolores, and their two teenage children Wayne and Lorraine.
The Halpin family was gradually introduced in the early 2000s, starting with Damien Halpin, his mother Tess Halpin and younger siblings Laura and Mark. Since then, the show&#x27;s focus has shifted to individual characters instead of family groupings. Notable characters introduced subsequently include Carol Meehan, Tracey Kavanagh, Ray O&#x27;Connell, and Jo Fahey.

Another change in recent years has been the introduction of ethnic minority characters such as Lana Dowling and the Udenze family. However, the Udenzes moved back to England after the father Gabriel was burnt to death in a fire, and Lana Dowling was kidnapped and murdered. In 2009 an Israeli character was introduced to the show – Avi Bar Lev, Avi hails from the town of Haifa in Israel. In 2013, Ama Chisenga, a devout Christian nurse from Zambia came to Carrigstown, and faced trouble with documentation for immigration. More recently in 2017, two Chilean brothers, Jake and Cristiano came to the show. Jake, who came first, was initially homeless, but later started a relationship with Ama. His gay brother Cristiano soon followed, and both now run a coffee shop, Brewzers, in the Carrigstown Arcade.

2012 brought the additions of the Dillon family – the Father Tommy, the Mother Judith and their three daughters Caoimhe Dillon, Neasa Dillon and Dearbhla Dillon, and their son Zak. The Bishops arrived in 2009, consisting of the mother Vivienne, her sons Decco, Denzo and Zumo and her daughter Charlotte. Vivienne&#x27;s niece Sash Bishop was introduced in 2011 and the patriarch Paddy Bishop in 2013. The O&#x27;Briens came in 2014 – the father Eoghan, the mother Debbie and their daughter Katy and their son Michael.

Paul Brennan is the only character from the first episode currently in the show. Sarah Flood was axed in 2013 after 23 years playing Suzanne Doyle.

Former executive producer Niall Mathews believes the soap&#x27;s success is due to the large cast and the fact that no single character or group of characters dominates. &quot;Difficulties are inherent if you are dealing with just one family&quot;, he says. &quot;Look at &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot;; both did well at the beginning, but because all the action was centred on a single family, the writers ran out of things to say.&quot;

Executive Producer Brigie de Courcy said: &quot;I think the big thing that &quot;Fair City&quot; does that the other soaps don&#x27;t quite do is that it is really rooted in the community.&quot;

==Production==
Running in parallel with the writing process is the production process, which includes: casting, wardrobe, make-up, design and construction of sets, purchase of props, finding locations, booking facilities, developing schedules, sound, and other administrative tasks involved in managing a large production.

Each week rehearsals for the four episodes take place on Saturday and Monday. Shooting takes place on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the interior scenes are filmed at Studios A and C on RTÉ&#x27;s Montrose campus. The exterior scenes are filmed on the lot within the grounds of the RTÉ Headquarters on Thursday and on location on Friday. Each day, 15 scenes are filmed. Scripts are prepared up to six months in advance, and episodes are shot six weeks before being aired. Four episodes are filmed every week. After shooting an episode, an editor will go through the episode scene by scene with the director. They will choose which shots to retain and which to cut.

From 1989 until 1994, all interior shots were filmed at Ardmore Studios, near Bray, County Wicklow. In 1994, production moved to studios at Montrose specifically adapted to cater for the show. Like Brookside, all exterior shots were initially filmed at real houses in a real cul-de-sac in Barron Place, Drumcondra and later in Booterstown. Due to the difficulties involved with shooting outside of a controlled environment (e.g. having to negotiate with residents, traffic noise, etc.), it was decided to build a streetscape, known as the lot. In 1992, the &quot;Fair City&quot; lot was built at Ardmore, where set designers replicated the facades and interiors of the original houses. In 1994, a new lot was built at the grounds of RTÉ. In 2018, production moved again for the first time in decades to the present lot in RTE. On each set appliances such as washing machines and gas cookers do not actually work most of the time.

The show has had four different opening sequences and five different theme tunes. The opening features several scenes of contemporary Dublin, while the closing credits shows a frozen image of the River Liffey.

===Writing===
The series is planned in various stages. The first stage is the development of story and plot, which is carried out by a team of writers. Once the stories have been fleshed out and agreed, a scene breakdown is created. The episodes are then assigned to script writers, who create the dialogue and stage directions for the actors.

Writers who have worked on Fair City scripts and storylines include Anna Carey, Sarah Francis, Michelle Duffy and Jennifer Davidson. 

===Theme tune===
&quot;Fair City&quot; original theme tune was composed by Adam Lynch and Hugh Drumm. They were asked to come up with a piece of music that would be &quot;easy on the ear, have a certain warmth, conjure up a feeling of Dublin and manage to reflect the mood of the programme&quot;. The second theme tune was introduced in 1995, the third in 2005 and the fourth in 2008. The 1995 theme is an orchestral version of the original. The 2005 theme is an upbeat piano version of the 1995 one. The present theme, composed by Columb Farrelly and Andy O&#x27;Callaghan, is a jazzed up version of the original.

===Imagery===
&quot;Fair City&quot; original opening sequence was designed by Carol Coffey. The second opening sequence was introduced in 1995 when the then executive producer John Lynch decided that the opening needed modernising. It was designed by John Hayes in collaboration with John Lynch. For 10 years, the opening remained unchanged, aside from the digital insertion of the Millennium Bridge. In order to be compatible with wide-screen format and show the changing face of Dublin, a new opening, designed by Michael McKeon, was introduced in 2005. The present opening, designed by Paul Gibney, was introduced in 2008.

===Post-production===
Each episode should run for 23 minutes (not counting ad breaks). If any episode runs over or under them, the executive producer and series editor will cut or add scenes where appropriate so that the episode ends up with the correct running time. As noted in the book &quot;Inside Fair City&quot;, the episode will &quot;go back to the editing suite and a final edit will be done to produce the finished product that viewers will see on screen&quot;.

===Budget===
In 2016, Fair City cost RTÉ €53,500 per episode, which adds up to €10.7m annually. &quot;Fair City&quot; actors earned nearly €460 per day. 15 scriptwriters received €3,495 per episode and nine were paid €1,837. RTE said the writers were given &quot;an additional 35pc of the basic fee per episode in respect of a further broadcast of the episode within seven days. These are rates agreed with the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild&quot;.

==Social realism==
The show has featured a number of gritty and controversial storylines reflecting major issues in Irish society, particularly from the mid-1990s. Former executive producer Niall Mathews said: &quot;We don&#x27;t hang out a banner saying we are dealing with rape and murder as issues. One of our characters gets raped and the story is how it affects her, her family and the community. We are not doing issue-driven programs. We use issues to illuminate the characters more than to illuminate the issues.&quot;

In 1996, three years after homosexuality was decriminalised in Ireland, male characters Eoghan and Liam moved in for a passionate embrace – only to be interrupted. It would have been the first gay kiss on Irish television. Moving into the 2000s &quot;Fair City&quot; began to deal with LGBT themes more openly and more regularly. Yvonne Doyle, a key character for much of the early 2000s, was bisexual, and used to date Connie from Australia. They were to have been married in Northern Ireland. Laura, lesbian daughter of Tess Halpin, formed a relationship with social worker Emily, only to have it broken up by the jealous, bitter and deranged Lucy. Troy, the son of Leo Dowling, is openly gay. The programme&#x27;s first transgender character was Ryan Donnelly, who debuted in 2017 and was played by the trans man Jack Murphy.

Also, in 1996, there was the false accusations story, in which schoolgirl Niamh Cassidy falsely accused her teacher Barry O&#x27;Hanlon of coming onto her after she seduced him and they had a passionate embrace. 1996 also saw the first murder on the show when Tony Kelly was killed by London criminal drug-dealers whom he owed money to.

In 1998, the show tackled the subject of rape, with the rape of Lorraine Molloy by Dr Jack Shanahan, who later committed suicide. Also, Kay McCoy began a relationship with Catholic priest Malachy Costello, who then left the priesthood and married Kay in 1999. Leo Dowling&#x27;s wife Sandie slept with his son Dean after finding out that Leo was having an affair. Helen Doyle died in a car accident. Noeleen and Stephen McCoy were brainwashed by a religious cult called The Church of the Children of Eternal Light. Foster care was shown in 1999 when Kay and Malachy fostered teenager Lorcan Foley. A psychopathic nanny, Mona Fagan, kidnapped Paul Brennan and Nicola Prendergast&#x27;s baby son Osin.

Abortion was portrayed in 2001 with a story which divided the country when Kay decided to abort her pregnancy against the wishes of the father Malachy. As an older mother, Kay has amniocentesis tests done which reveal the child has trisomy-13 which means that the child would be born severely disabled and probably would not survive long after birth. The storyline was seen by the actors and producers as controversial and heart-breaking. They recognised the time sensitive nature of the decisions that had to be made and the potential impacts and worked to show it all. This storyline caused anti-abortion viewers to complain to the Justice Minister on the grounds that the story was hate speech against people with disabilities.

Drug addiction has also been portrayed a number of times. In 1997, Lorraine Molly became addicted to amphetamines to cram for her exams. One of &quot;Fair City&quot; best-known storylines took place in 2001, with crime lord Billy Meehan abusing his wife Carol and mistress Tracey McGuigan before being murdered by Carol&#x27;s son Lorcan. Prostitution was also shown in 2001 when Tracey turned to prostitution in order to pay for drugs.

Prostate cancer awareness was raised in June 2002 in a storyline depicting Bela Doyle&#x27;s battle with prostate cancer. Gambling addiction was depicted, with Malachy&#x27;s gambling addiction. Mental health issues were confronted in December 2002 when Yvonne Doyle developed schizophrenia (which led to her taking a drug overdose in a suicide attempt). In 2003, storylines included teenage pregnancy (14-year-old Kira Cassidy giving birth to a baby girl, Juliet) and Heather Lyons&#x27; incestuous relationship with her half-brother Floyd Phelan (though they didn&#x27;t know they were half-siblings at first). An Accident and Emergency special was aired in March 2003.

Domestic abuse was highlighted with the Halpin family when Tess was murdered by her husband Marty following years of domestic abuse. The episode aired on 3 April 2003 and RTÉ had to set up a help-line following the episode. More recently in 2010, there was a domestic abuse storyline involving Tess&#x27;s eldest son Damien. This time Damien&#x27;s partner Suzanne was the abusive person in the relationship and this ultimately led to them breaking up. A week-long special dealt with date rape and teen suicide against the backdrop of the educational system.

In 2004, &quot;Fair City&quot; continued to feature issues such as eating disorders (Robin McKenna&#x27;s bulimia) and teacher Sorcha Byrne&#x27;s illicit affair with 19-year-old student Ross O&#x27;Rourke (which culminated in Barry O&#x27;Hanlon being overcome by clinical depression and having a mental breakdown). Breast cancer awareness was raised (Nicola&#x27;s battle with breast cancer). A three-week-long special dealt with Catholic Church politics, the legal system and the clerical sexual abuse of children.

Homelessness was shown in 2005 when Cleo Collins slept rough on the streets. Gangland killing was also featured in 2005 when Mick Mahoney killed Alex Yuschenko, a Ukrainian gang member, under the orders of his new boss crime lord Sylvester Garrigan (which led to his niece Ali O&#x27;Shea being held hostage by them in 2006). Also, accidental drug overdose was highlighted, with the death of Dolores Molloy&#x27;s baby Jessica from an accidental Ecstasy overdose when Ross left some ecstasy tablets on the floor of the Molloy household. A two-week-long special looked at the murkier side of yuppie life against the backdrop of property speculation reflecting the Celtic Tiger.

In 2006, the gangland storyline was revisited, with a chain of bad fortune for Garrigan ultimately leading to his downfall. First, he was wounded in a drive-by shooting, which was an assassination attempt on his life by the Ukrainian gang in retaliation for killing Alex. Subsequently, a sting operation by undercover Garda Rory Goff found drugs that Lorcan was piggybacking on one of Garrigan&#x27;s booze runs. Garrigan was furious that Lorcan had implicated him in drug-dealing and he ordered Lorcan to kill Rory. As Rory and Lorcan confronted each other, Lorcan fired the first shot, but Rory struck back with another, wounding them both in the process. Rory survived, but Lorcan&#x27;s days were numbered. Lorcan made a deathbed confession to the Gardaí before he died in hospital. Garrigan was arrested and was never seen again, but he is assumed to be in prison. Tim Carney&#x27;s domineering marriage with Olga was also featured. Racism was shown when the Udenze family were targeted by racists Pete Flanngan and Morgan Dalton.

In 2007, the show tackled the subject of bullying, with the bullying of Mark Halpin. Missing persons were also highlighted in 2007 with the disappearance of Lana Dowling. In 2008, the show dealt with the issue of euthanasia by featuring Floyd&#x27;s death in a pact with Heather&#x27;s husband Brendan. The Criminal Assets Bureau was shown when Carol lost her pub and nightclub which were purchased by Billy with his ill-gotten gains. In 2009 mental health issues were confronted such as Keith McGrath&#x27;s desertion of the British Army and Bill Taylor&#x27;s psychological torture over Annette Daly&#x27;s alcoholism. 2009 also saw the show&#x27;s first bisexual love triangle and lesbian storyline when Yvonne Doyle had an affair with her best friend Connie Boylan.

In 2010, Damien Halpin&#x27;s unemployment reflects the Irish financial crisis. In addition the many scenes of domestic abuse towards Damien by his wife Suzanne have brought into the open the taboo subject of spousal abuse towards males. The series has been praised for this edgy and at times controversial storyline. It proved to be so popular that British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; later did their own version. Organ donor awareness was raised in 2011 when Lucy Mallon received a cornea transplant. Wearing pyjamas during the day was covered with Sash Bishop. Aside from this, soap opera staples of youthful romance, jealousy, rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured. Late 2011/early 2012 saw Orla Kirwan and Caoimhe Dillon engage in numerous shoplifting sprees around Dublin. In April 2012, life in prison was covered, with prisoner Decco Bishop fearing for his life behind bars. Domestic violence has been a recurring theme in &quot;Fair City&quot;, most recently in 2013 with the introduction of the character Paddy Bishop, who is captured on screen flaking his wife Vivienne with a belt.

In December 2013, Yvonne Doyle is raped by Internet predator Martin Baxter. He later bombards her with calls and texts, and calls to her restaurant Vino&#x27;s and threatens her, but she later reports him to the police. In January 2014, Paul Brennan finds himself the victim of a blackmail plot when Jane extorts €40,000 from him. In March 2014, Yvonne faces a trial which she is terrified about. Also, in February/March 2014, bullying is covered again with the bullying of Rachel Brennan by Amanda Ryan, who torments Rachel along with a group of girls. In April and May 2014, stalking is shown, with stalker Tommy Dillon&#x27;s campaign of terror towards his ex-wife Judith. Tommy is eventually outed as the stalker and, in late May 2014, holds Judith hostage with a gun. In July 2014, Christy Phelan has a stroke. Katy O&#x27;Brien questions her sexuality and becomes the show&#x27;s first character to come out on-screen.

In August 2015, &quot;Fair City&quot; took on the issue of miscarriage when couple Damien and Caoimhe lost their baby.

From May 2016 until May 2017, &quot;Fair City&quot; provided its longest storyline ever, &quot;Who Kidnapped Katy?&quot; The storyline focussed on Katy O&#x27;Brien, who was kidnapped and later held hostage in the garage of Ciarán Holloway, who had come to Carrigstown to seek revenge on Emmett O&#x27;Brien – Katy&#x27;s brother – for apparently giving rise to his sister&#x27;s death in South-East Asia whilst travelling. During this period, Katy had become extremely attached to Ciarán, and later defended his honour on television and to his family, in what would be described as the effects of Stockholm syndrome.

In August 2016, Fair City tackled the issue of child abuse when Carol&#x27;s father Trigger arrives in Carrigstown and she is forced to face her dark past.

In October 2019, Fair City tackled the issue of domestic abuse in a gay relationship between Cristiano San Martin and Will Casey. The show highlighted abusive behaviour such as psychological and emotional manipulation and gaslighting as Will tormented Cristiano. In the show, Cristiano would often reply to Will&#x27;s domestic abuse saying &quot;Will, you&#x27;re scaring me&quot; which was turned into a popular catchphrase in Irish media as a nod to the MeToo Movement and a number of t-shirts were sold sporting the phrase.

Problem gambling was covered in 2024 when Anto was struggling with a Gambling Addiction

==History==
===Concept and inspiration===
In 1988, a year before &quot;Fair City&quot; hit the screens, the show was just a vague idea conceived by RTÉ when it decided that it needed an urban soap opera to compete with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;. RTÉ gave the job of creating this new soap to Margaret Gleeson. Gleeson, known for her work on Tolka Row and The Riordans, was appointed the show&#x27;s first Executive Producer with Paul Cusack and David McKenna as producers. Tony Holland – co-creator of &quot;EastEnders&quot; – was brought in as a consultant. The target launch date was September 1989 and an initial run of 13 episodes was commissioned.

With the help of Cusack, McKenna and Holland, Gleeson devised the many components needed to make the initial thirteen-episode limited series. She created twenty-two original characters for the soap and cast actors for them. The show had a number of working titles – &quot;Glasfin&quot; and &quot;Northsiders&quot; – before settling on &quot;Fair City&quot;. Gleeson had nine weeks in which to shoot the whole thing.

&quot;Fair City&quot; derives its title from the opening line of the traditional song &quot;Molly Malone&quot;: &quot;In Dublin&#x27;s fair city, where the girls are so pretty...&quot; and was the only English-language soap opera produced in Ireland until &quot;Red Rock&quot; was launched on TV3 on 7 January 2015. The show was launched with an hour-long pilot episode, written by Peter Sheridan, on 18 September 1989 and at the time was described as &quot;the most ambitious production of its kind ever undertaken by RTÉ&quot;.

===Early years: 1989–1994===
&quot;Fair City&quot; was not an instant success and was on shaky ground for a couple of seasons. Former executive producer John Lynch recalled: &quot;My impression of it at the time was of nothing happening very fast, then you&#x27;d cut to a scene where nothing happened even faster, then there would be a shot of somebody riding a bicycle stuck in between, they were trying to copy Eastenders, but Tony Holland didn&#x27;t realise that the Irish are less direct than the English.&quot;

RTÉ&#x27;s Director of Television Production at the time described the situation:
&quot;Now Fair City had run 17 episodes and there was a big question mark over its future. This had been for several reasons. One was the audience, by far the largest audience had been for the first show and the 17 or the 16 that followed showed a fairly relentless fall in audience figures. And if you&#x27;re doing something like a soap actually you expect the reverse trend if it&#x27;s working&quot;.

In 1990, RTÉ executives initially cancelled the show after the first season. However, they then decided to renew it for a second season. They brought in Irish writer Mary Halpin to drastically revamp the series.

Tony Tormey, who plays Paul Brennan, explains: &quot;He [Tony Holland] just didn&#x27;t have the Irish thing. The scripts were all in a different idiom. They were written in Londonese rather than Dublinese. It just didn&#x27;t work so they cancelled it. But they stuck with it and brought Mary Halpin in. It was almost like starting again.&quot;

The introduction of strong story lines centring on the Doyle and Molloy families in the early 1990s began to gradually improve the soap&#x27;s popularity and were overseen by new executive producer Niall Mathews, who was in charge from 1990 to 2008, apart from the period between 1994 and 1998. He oversaw the show&#x27;s transformation from a minor, urban drama into one of Ireland&#x27;s major soaps, challenging &quot;Glenroe&quot; in the ratings. In 1994 John Lynch became executive producer and during his time &quot;Fair City&quot; began dealing with gritty and controversial issues previously unseen on Irish television.

===Later years: 2002–present===
On 17 January 2002, &quot;Fair City&quot; reached its 1,000th episode. In 2004, the soap opera celebrated its fifteenth year by broadcasting an hour-long compilation episode entitled &quot;Fair City: The Ten Commandments&quot;. This episode showed clips of characters breaking the Ten Commandments. It also featured interviews with the cast, writers, creator and fans. On 30 November 2006, Fair City reached its 2,000th episode.

In 2008 veteran Executive Producer Niall Mathews bowed out of the show and was replaced by former Script Editor Brigie de Courcy. During her reign, the soap has received critical acclaim for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories. In September 2011, Fair City reached its 3,000th episode. In 2013, the serial&#x27;s 24th anniversary was celebrated with an hour-long special, in which characters Damien, Caoimhe, Tommy and Luke were trapped in a fire at a factory.

Fair City celebrated its 25th anniversary in September 2014 by airing episodes such as Paul Brennan finding out that his wife Niamh is leaving him for Michael and Christy Phelan&#x27;s death at the hands of his daughter Farrah&#x27;s husband Max. In September 2016, the soap reached its 4,000th episode.

19 October 2017 saw the airing of the show&#x27;s first two-hander episode featuring Paul and Niamh. An hour-long special was shown in September 2019 to celebrate the soap&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

===Broadcast format===
The show was initially aired with one episode per week for a limited run (16 weeks). In 1990, RTÉ opted to recommission the soap and air one episode a week between September and June, taking a summer break. In 1994, its output was increased to twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7pm. In 1996, the series started being broadcast all year around with one weekly episode during the summer months. In 1998 an extra episode was added and a fourth was added in 2001. In 2000, a second weekly episode was added in the summer. In 2003, the programme started airing four episodes all year-round from the summer of that year. In 2004, Friday&#x27;s 8.30 pm episode was moved to Sunday nights at 8pm. In 2022 Wednesday&#x27;s night Episode move to Friday night. 

In 2023, following the fall out of the governance and management scandals at RTÉ, it was announce that as part of cost saving measures that Fair City would see the number of episodes per week drop to 3 a week during 2024. Four episodes of the series will be recorded each week but production will take a break each year in July and August. 

===International screenings===
*Northern Ireland and Britain
Since early 2001 RTÉ One has also been available on most digital platforms in Northern Ireland through Sky and Virgin Media, &quot;Fair City&quot; is officially available on this service to audiences in this territory. Prior to 2001 in Northern Ireland, UTV aired episodes of the soap in the early and mid-90s during its daytime schedule. Episodes shown on UTV were seasons behind RTÉ. Prior to the arrival of digital terrestrial television in Europe, many viewers in Northern Ireland, Wales and North-western England could watch &quot;Fair City&quot; on RTÉ One, because some of those populations were able to receive Irish television through spillover, although signal spillover has reduced since the transition to digital.

&quot;Fair City&quot; was shown on the Tara Television network in the United Kingdom via cable and Sky Digital from 1997 until the closure of the station in 2002. Classic episodes were shown in the daytime and repeated in the early evenings on weekdays, and current episodes were simulcast with RTÉ One. STV in Scotland announced that it would broadcast the show when the local STV channels rebranded as STV2. The series launched in April 2017 with a thirty-minute documentary entitled &quot;Fair City: The Story So Far&quot; before airing the Christmas Day episode from 2014.

*International
The show is available to a global audience through RTÉ Player International.

===Product placement===
In 2011, BWG Foods, operators of the SPAR brand in Ireland, invested €900,000 in a three-year deal to have SPAR appear in &quot;Fair City&quot;. The new shop, formerly Christy Phelan&#x27;s corner shop, was unveiled in an episode broadcast on 6 December 2011. It was RTÉ&#x27;s first high-profile product placement deal, and followed the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&#x27;s decision to allow paid product placement on Irish television, in line with relaxed EU regulations. There are 450 SPAR outlets in the Republic of Ireland. RTÉ was obliged to inform viewers before each episode aired it contained product placement. RTÉ said that &quot;Fair City&quot;″s editor-in-chief would ensure there were no gratuitous references or prominence given to Spar that would not happen anyway.

===COVID-19===
Due to coronavirus-related lockdown issues, Fair City was taken off air for the first time in its history, with the last filmed episode broadcast on 12 April 2020. After a five-month break, the show returned on Sunday 6 September, three nights a week. The fictional character Renee Phelan got COVID-19 and recovered off air. RTÉ stated in January 2021 that it planned to commence testing actors and production staff for the virus.

==Popularity and viewership==
&quot;Fair City&quot; consistently pulls in an average of 300,000-400,000 viewers per episode, rising for special episodes. The soap is popular with viewers nationwide. A constant ratings winner for RTÉ, the show rivals British imports such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on Virgin Media. The launch show attracted 1.06 million viewers. On 21 November 2001, &quot;Fair City&quot; attracted 840,000 viewers who tuned in to see Billy Meehan being killed by Lorcan Foley. 660,000 viewers tuned in to watch Sylvester Garrigan get shot on 19 January 2006. 731,000 viewers watched on 23 November 2010 to see the latest development featuring battered husband Damien Halpin. The show was not an instant ratings success in the first couple of seasons, but became more favourable in subsequent seasons, when there were strong story lines centring on the Doyle and Molloy families.

When &quot;Fair City&quot; returned from a hiatus in late 2020, the show declined substantially, with viewer numbers dipping below average. A slight increase was reported over the Christmas season in 2021.

&quot;The Wire&quot; star Reg E. Cathey has expressed his interest in a part on the show, saying he would like to play &quot;an American guy coming to meet his daughter who is now a big singer, someone like Laura Izibor&quot;.

For a short period in 2017, Fair City aired on Scottish television network STV2.

==Critical reception==
Reception to the pilot episode was positive from Eamon Dunphy of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, Brendan Glacken of the &quot;Irish Times&quot; and Eddie Holt of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. However, over time, the serial was not a critical success, but it has received acclaim recently for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories under executive producer Brigie de Courcy. Helena Sheehan has published academic accounts and analyses of its ups and downs.

==Awards==
The programme was nominated for an IFTA as &#x27;Best Television Drama&#x27; in the years 2000 and 2003. Stuart Dunne, who portrayed Billy Meehan, was nominated for an IFTA as &#x27;Best Actor in a Television Drama&#x27; in 2003.

Pat Nolan, who plays Barry O&#x27;Hanlon, won a Rose d&#x27;Or award in the &#x27;Best Soap Actor&#x27; category at the international Rose d&#x27;Or Festival in Switzerland on 7 May 2005. The series has also been nominated for a TVNow Award as &#x27;Favourite Soap&#x27; in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Its first ever victory, in 2008, was matched by a second victory in 2009. &quot;Fair City&quot; won &#x27;Best Soap in the International Entertainment&#x27; category, at the Mediamixx festival in Bulgaria in July 2007.

==Actors Pay==
RTÉ pays some &quot;Fair City&quot; cast members €432 a day, although the soap generates revenue in the region of €7m each year for RTÉ. Tommy O&#x27;Neill, the actor who played Detective Deegan, was embroiled in a row with a taxi driver over a €10 fare in November 2011.

Established actor Tony Tormey, who plays long running character Paul Brennan, was paid between €99,000 and €150,000 a year in 2016 and 2017, this amounted to €4,500 for a shooting week, with a contract for 31 weeks. 

== Complaints ==
As a result of a storyline, school managers feared that students were starting &quot;copycat&quot; fight clubs in post primary schools around the country. RTÉ has also launched an investigation into how a convicted child sex offender appeared as an extra in the soap. &quot;Fair City&quot; was criticised by Down&#x27;s Syndrome Ireland for using the derogatory term &quot;mongo&quot; on 20 January 2006 episode.

==Broadcast availability==
At the launch of the RTÉ Player, &quot;Fair City&quot; was provided for one month as part of the trial service. It was later removed as the actor&#x27;s union (Equity Ireland) would not agree to terms to provide the show online. On 27 May 2011, RTÉ One +1 launched on Saorview without &quot;Fair City&quot;, during the broadcast of &quot;Fair City&quot; the following announcement was made &quot;This programme is not available on Saorview&quot;. In May 2012, this changed; and Fair City is now available on both RTÉ One +1 and RTÉ Player.

==Merchandise==
In 2005, script writer Brian Gallagher wrote a book about the show, entitled &quot;Inside Fair City&quot;. A 20th anniversary DVD under the title &quot;Fair City: 20 Years in Carrigstown&quot; was released in 2009.

<doc id="219058" wikidata="Q833029" url="?curid=219058" title="Bodoni">
<text>Bodoni (, ) is the name given to the serif typefaces first designed by Giambattista Bodoni (1740–1813) in the late eighteenth century and frequently revived since. Bodoni&#x27;s typefaces are classified as Didone or modern. Bodoni followed the ideas of John Baskerville, as found in the printing type Baskerville—increased stroke contrast reflecting developing printing technology and a more vertical axis—but he took them to a more extreme conclusion. Bodoni had a long career and his designs changed and varied, ending with a typeface of a slightly condensed underlying structure with flat, unbracketed serifs, extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, and an overall geometric construction.

When first released, Bodoni and other didone fonts were called classical designs because of their rational structure. However, these fonts were not updated versions of Roman or Renaissance letter styles, but new designs. They came to be called &#x27;modern&#x27; serif fonts; since the mid-20th century, they are also known as Didone designs.

Some digital versions of Bodoni are said to be hard to read due to &quot;dazzle&quot; caused by the alternating thick and thin strokes, particularly as the thin strokes are very thin at small point sizes. This is very common when optical sizes of font intended for use at display sizes are printed at text size, at which point the hairline strokes can recede to being hard to see. Versions of Bodoni that are intended to be used at text size are &quot;Bodoni Old Face&quot;, optimized for 9 points; ITC Bodoni 12 (for 12 points); and ITC Bodoni 6 (for 6 points).

Massimo Vignelli stated that &quot;Bodoni is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed.&quot; In the English-speaking world, &quot;modern&quot; serif designs like Bodoni are most commonly used in headings and display uses and in upmarket magazine printing, which is often done on high-gloss paper that retains and sets off the crisp detail of the fine strokes. In Europe, they are more often used in body text.

==Inspiration==

Bodoni admired the work of John Baskerville and studied in detail the designs of French type founders Pierre Simon Fournier and Firmin Didot. Although he drew inspiration from the work of these designers, above all from Didot, no doubt Bodoni found his own style for his typefaces, which deservedly gained worldwide acceptance among printers.

Although to a modern audience Bodoni is best known as the name of a typeface, Bodoni was an expert printer who ran a prestigious printing-office under the patronage of the Duke of Parma, and the design of his type was permitted by and showcased the quality of his company&#x27;s work in metal-casting, printing and of the paper made in Parma. The hairline serifs and fine strokes reflected a high quality of casting, since on poor-quality printing equipment serifs had to be large to avoid wear snapping them. The smooth finish of his paper allowed fine detail to be retained on the surface. Bodoni also took care in the composition of his printing, using hierarchy and borders to create an appearance of elegance, and his range of type sizes allowed him flexibility of composition.

Writing of meeting him in the year 1786, James Edward Smith said:

A very great curiosity in its way is the Parma printing-office, carried on under the direction of Mr. Bodoni, who has brought that art to a degree of perfection scarcely known before him. Nothing could exceed his civility in showing us numbers of the beautiful productions of his press...as well as the operations of casting and finishing the letters...his paper is all made 
at Parma. The manner in which Mr. Bodoni gives his works their beautiful smoothness, so that no impression of the letters is perceptible on either side, is the only part of his business that he keeps secret.

The effective use of Bodoni in modern printing poses challenges common to all Didone designs. While it can look very elegant due to the regular, rational design and fine strokes, a known effect on readers is &#x27;dazzle&#x27;, where the thick verticals draw the reader&#x27;s attention and cause them to struggle to concentrate on the other, much thinner strokes that define which letter is which. For this reason, using the right optical size of font has been described as particularly essential to achieve professional results. Fonts to be used at text sizes will be sturdier designs with thicker &#x27;thin&#x27; strokes and serifs (less stroke contrast) and more space between letters than on display designs, to increase legibility. Optical sizes were a natural requirement of printing technology at the time of Bodoni, who had to cut each size of type separately, but declined as the pantograph, phototypesetting and digital fonts made printing the same font at any size simpler; a revival has taken place in recent years as automated font development has become possible. French designer Loïc Sander has suggested that the dazzle effect, common to all Didone designs, may be particularly common in designs produced in countries where designers are unfamiliar with how to use them effectively and where the fonts that are easily commercially available will tend to have been designed for headings. Modern Bodoni revivals intended for professional use such as Parmagiano and ITC Bodoni have a range of optical sizes, but this is less common on default computer fonts.

==Foundry type revivals and variants==
There have been many revivals of the Bodoni typeface; ATF Bodoni and Bauer Bodoni are two of the more successful.
* ATF&#x27;s &quot;Bodoni series&quot; created in 1909, was the first American release to be a direct revival of Bodoni&#x27;s work. All variants were designed by Morris Fuller Benton who captured the flavour of Bodoni&#x27;s original while emphasizing legibility rather than trying to push against the limits of printing technology. This revival is regarded as &quot;the first accurate revival of a historical face for general printing and design applications&quot;. However, some details were less based on Bodoni than on the work of his French contemporary Firmin Didot, for example a &#x27;t&#x27; with a flat rather than slanted top.

* Monotype:

* Ludlow:

* Damon Type Foundry offered a Bodoni under the name &quot;Bartlet&quot;.
* Linotype and Intertype also produced matrices for machine composition that were somewhat narrower than the foundry type versions.
* Haas Type Foundry produced a version which was then licensed to D. Stempel AG, Amsterdam Type Foundry, and Berthold.
* The Bauer Type Foundry version was drawn by Heinrich Jost in 1926. The Bauer version emphasizes the extreme contrast between hairline and main stroke. The series included the following weights:
==Cold type versions==

As it had been a standard type for many years, &quot;Bodoni&quot; was widely available in cold type. Alphatype, Autologic, Berthold, Compugraphic, Dymo, Harris, Mergenthaler, MGD Graphic Systems, and Varityper, Hell AG, Monotype, all sold the face under the name &quot;Bodoni,&quot; while Graphic Systems Inc. offered the face as &quot;Brunswick&quot; and Star/Photon called their version &quot;BodoniStar.&quot;

==Digital versions==
Digital revivals include Bodoni Antiqua, Bodoni Old Face, ITC Bodoni Seventy Two, ITC Bodoni Six, ITC Bodoni Twelve, Bodoni MT, LTC Bodoni 175, WTC Our Bodoni, Bodoni EF, Bodoni Classico, and TS Bodoni. Zuzana Licko&#x27;s Filosofia is considered by some to be a revival of Bodoni, but it is a highly personal, stylish, and stylized spinoff, rather than a revival. Although intended to be usable at text sizes, it represents the early period of the designer&#x27;s career when interletter spacing was yet to be conquered, so has found use primarily in advertising. A particularly carefully optically-sized Bodoni is Sumner Stone&#x27;s ITC version in three sizes (6 point, 12 point, 72 point). Another important Bodoni optimized for book printing (9 point) is Günther Gerhard Lange&#x27;s &quot;Bodoni Old Face&quot; from the Berthold library. Most other versions are best used at display sizes. 

==Poster Bodoni==
Poster Bodoni is a variant created for posters, designed by Chauncey H. Griffith in 1929.

==Applications==

* Poster Bodoni is used in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; posters.
* Bodoni is used in the logos for luxury brands Calvin Klein and Zara, as well as throughout the in-store signage of Canadian bookstore Chapters.
* A variation of Bodoni designed by Matthew Carter, called &quot;Stilson&quot; (originally &quot;Postoni&quot; during its period of exclusivity), is the primary headline font for The Washington Post newspaper.
* Bodoni was the favorite typeset of Ted Hughes, UK Poet Laureate, 1984–1998.
* Bodoni was used as Nirvana&#x27;s logo font starting with their debut album, Bleach, and being used on all subsequent releases
* In the early days the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust used &quot;Bodoni Book&quot; for the text in most of its publications, especially Srimad-Bhagavatam.
* Australian university RMIT University uses Bodoni in its logo.
* Music publishing company Henle Urtext Editions uses Bodoni in its front cover of its books.

<text>The Ojibwe (; syll.: ᐅᒋᐺ; plural: &quot;Ojibweg&quot; ᐅᒋᐺᒃ) are an Anishinaabe people whose homeland (&quot;Ojibwewaki&quot; ᐅᒋᐺᐘᑭ) covers much of the Great Lakes region and the northern plains, extending into the subarctic and throughout the northeastern woodlands. The Ojibwe, being Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands and of the subarctic, are known by several names, including Ojibway or Chippewa. As a large ethnic group, several distinct nations also consider themselves Ojibwe, including the Saulteaux, Nipissings, and Oji-Cree.

According to the U.S. census, Ojibwe people are one of the largest tribal populations among Native American peoples in the U.S. In Canada, they are the second-largest First Nations population, surpassed only by the Cree. They are one of the most numerous Indigenous peoples north of the Rio Grande. The Ojibwe population is approximately 320,000, with 170,742 living in the U.S. and approximately 160,000 in Canada. In the U.S. there are 77,940 mainline Ojibwe, 76,760 Saulteaux, and 8,770 Mississauga, organized in 125 bands. In Canada they live from western Quebec to eastern British Columbia.

The Ojibwe language is Anishinaabemowin, a branch of the Algonquian language family.

The Ojibwe are part of the Council of Three Fires (along with the Odawa and Potawatomi) and of the larger Anishinaabeg, which includes Algonquin, Nipissing, and Oji-Cree people. Historically, through the Saulteaux branch, they were part of the Iron Confederacy, with the Cree, Assiniboine, and Metis.

The Ojibwe are known for their birchbark canoes, birchbark scrolls, mining and trade in copper, and their harvesting of wild rice and maple syrup. Their Midewiwin Society is well respected as the keeper of detailed and complex scrolls of events, oral history, songs, maps, memories, stories, geometry, and mathematics.

European powers, Canada, and the U.S. have colonized Ojibwe lands. The Ojibwe signed treaties with settler leaders to surrender land for settlement in exchange for compensation, land reserves and guarantees of traditional rights. Many European settlers moved into the Ojibwe ancestral lands.

==Etymology==
The exonym for this Anishinaabe group is &quot;Ojibwe&quot; (plural: &quot;Ojibweg&quot;). This word has two variations, one French (Ojibwa) and the other English (Chippewa). Although many variations exist in the literature, &quot;Chippewa&quot; is more common in the United States, and &quot;Ojibway&quot; predominates in Canada, but both terms are used in each country. In many Ojibwe communities throughout Canada and the U.S. since the late 20th century, more members have been using the generalized name &quot;Anishinaabe(-g)&quot;.

The meaning of the name &quot;Ojibwe&quot; is not known; the most common explanations for the name&#x27;s origin are:
* &quot;ojiibwabwe&quot; (/o/ + /jiibw/ + /abwe/), meaning &quot;those who cook/roast until it puckers&quot;, referring to their fire-curing of moccasin seams to make them waterproof. Some 19th century sources say this name described a method of ritual torture that the Ojibwe applied to enemies.
* &quot;ozhibii&#x27;iwe&quot; (/o/ + /zhibii&#x27;/ + /iwe/), meaning &quot;those who keep records [of a Vision]&quot;, referring to their form of pictorial writing, and pictographs used in Midewiwin sacred rites; or
* &quot;ojiibwe&quot; (/o/ + /jiib/ + /we/), meaning &quot;those who speak stiffly&quot; or &quot;those who stammer&quot;, an exonym or name given to them by the Cree, who described the Ojibwe language for its differences from their own.

Because many Ojibwe were formerly located around the outlet of Lake Superior, which the French colonists called Sault Ste. Marie for its rapids, the early Canadian settlers referred to the Ojibwe as &quot;Saulteurs&quot;. Ojibwe who subsequently moved to the prairie provinces of Canada have retained the name Saulteaux. This is disputed since some scholars believe that only the name migrated west. Ojibwe who were originally located along the Mississagi River and made their way to southern Ontario are known as the Mississaugas.

==Language==
The Ojibwe language is known as &quot;Anishinaabemowin&quot; or &quot;Ojibwemowin&quot;, and is still widely spoken, although the number of fluent speakers has declined sharply. Today, most of the language&#x27;s fluent speakers are elders. Since the early 21st century, there is a growing movement to revitalize the language and restore its strength as a central part of Ojibwe culture. The language belongs to the Algonquian linguistic group and is descended from Proto-Algonquian. Its sister languages include Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Cree, Fox, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Shawnee among the northern Plains tribes. &quot;Anishinaabemowin&quot; is frequently referred to as a &quot;Central Algonquian&quot; language; Central Algonquian is an area grouping, however, rather than a linguistic genetic one.

&quot;Ojibwemowin&quot; is the fourth-most spoken Native language in North America after Navajo, Cree, and Inuktitut. Many decades of fur trading with the French established the language as one of the key trade languages of the Great Lakes and the northern Great Plains.

The popularity of the epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1855, publicized the Ojibwe culture. The epic contains many toponyms that originate from Ojibwe words.

==History==
===Precontact and spiritual beliefs===
According to Ojibwe oral history and from recordings in birch bark scrolls, the Ojibwe originated from the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River on the Atlantic coast of what is now Quebec. They traded widely across the continent for thousands of years as they migrated, and knew of the canoe routes to move north, west to east, and then south in the Americas. The identification of the Ojibwe as a culture or people may have occurred in response to contact with Europeans. The Europeans preferred to deal with groups, and tried to identify those they encountered.

According to Ojibwe oral history, seven great &quot;miigis&quot; (Cowrie shells) appeared to them in the &quot;Waabanakiing&quot; (Land of the Dawn, i.e., Eastern Land) to teach them the &quot;mide&quot; way of life. One of the &quot;miigis&quot; was too spiritually powerful and killed the people in the &quot;Waabanakiing&quot; when they were in its presence. The six others remained to teach, while the one returned into the ocean. The six established &quot;doodem&quot; (clans) for people in the east, symbolized by animals. The five original Anishinaabe &quot;doodem&quot; were the &quot;Wawaazisii&quot; (Bullhead), &quot;Baswenaazhi&quot; (Echo-maker, i.e., Crane), &quot;Aan&#x27;aawenh&quot; (Pintail Duck), &quot;Nooke&quot; (Tender, i.e., Bear) and &quot;Moozoonsii&quot; (Little Moose). The six &quot;miigis&quot; then returned to the ocean as well. If the seventh had stayed, it would have established the Thunderbird &quot;doodem&quot;.

At a later time, one of these &quot;miigis&quot; appeared in a vision to relate a prophecy. It said that if the Anishinaabeg did not move farther west, they would not be able to keep their traditional ways alive because of the many new pale-skinned settlers who would arrive soon in the east. Their migration path would be symbolized by a series of smaller Turtle Islands, which was confirmed with &quot;miigis&quot; shells (i.e., cowry shells). After receiving assurance from their &quot;Allied Brothers&quot; (i.e., Mi&#x27;kmaq) and &quot;Father&quot; (i.e., Abenaki) of their safety to move inland, the Anishinaabeg gradually migrated west along the Saint Lawrence River to the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing, and then to the Great Lakes.

The first of the smaller Turtle Islands was &quot;Mooniyaa&quot;, where &quot;Mooniyaang&quot; (present-day Montreal) developed. The &quot;second stopping place&quot; was in the vicinity of the &quot;Wayaanag-gakaabikaa&quot; (Concave Waterfalls, i.e., Niagara Falls). At their &quot;third stopping place&quot;, near the present-day city of Detroit, Michigan, the Anishinaabeg divided into six groups, of which the Ojibwe was one.

The first significant new Ojibwe culture-center was their &quot;fourth stopping place&quot; on &quot;Manidoo Minising&quot; (Manitoulin Island). Their first new political-center was referred to as their &quot;fifth stopping place&quot;, in their present country at &quot;Baawiting&quot; (Sault Ste. Marie).
Continuing their westward expansion, the Ojibwe divided into the &quot;northern branch&quot;, following the north shore of Lake Superior, and the &quot;southern branch&quot;, along its south shore.

As the people continued to migrate westward, the &quot;northern branch&quot; divided into a &quot;westerly group&quot; and a &quot;southerly group&quot;. The &quot;southern branch&quot; and the &quot;southerly group&quot; of the &quot;northern branch&quot; came together at their &quot;sixth stopping place&quot; on Spirit Island () located in the Saint Louis River estuary at the western end of Lake Superior. (This has since been developed as the present-day Duluth/Superior cities.) The people were directed in a vision by the &quot;miigis&quot; being to go to the &quot;place where there is food (i.e., wild rice) upon the waters.&quot; Their second major settlement, referred to as their &quot;seventh stopping place&quot;, was at Shaugawaumikong (or &quot;Zhaagawaamikong&quot;, French, &quot;Chequamegon&quot;) on the southern shore of Lake Superior, near the present La Pointe, Wisconsin.

The &quot;westerly group&quot; of the &quot;northern branch&quot; migrated along the Rainy River, Red River of the North, and across the northern Great Plains until reaching the Pacific Northwest. Along their migration to the west, they came across many &quot;miigis&quot;, or cowry shells, as told in the prophecy.

===Contact with Europeans===
The first historical mention of the Ojibwe occurs in the French &quot;Jesuit Relation&quot; of 1640, a report by the missionary priests to their superiors in France. Through their friendship with the French traders (&quot;coureurs des bois&quot; and voyageurs), the Ojibwe gained guns, began to use European goods, and began to dominate their traditional enemies, the Lakota and Fox to their west and south. They drove the Sioux from the Upper Mississippi region to the area of the present-day Dakotas, and forced the Fox down from northern Wisconsin. The latter allied with the Sauk for protection.

By the end of the 18th century, the Ojibwe controlled nearly all of present-day Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and Minnesota, including most of the Red River area. They also controlled the entire northern shores of lakes Huron and Superior on the Canadian side and extending westward to the Turtle Mountains of North Dakota. In the latter area, the French Canadians called them Ojibwe or &quot;Saulteaux&quot;.

The Ojibwe were part of a long-term alliance with the Anishinaabe Odawa and Potawatomi peoples, called the Council of Three Fires. They fought against the Iroquois Confederacy, based mainly to the southeast of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, and the Sioux to the west. The Ojibwa stopped the Iroquois advance into their territory near Lake Superior in 1662. Then they formed an alliance with other tribes such as the Huron and the Odawa who had been displaced by the Iroquois invasion. Together they launched a massive counterattack against the Iroquois and drove them out of Michigan and southern Ontario until they were forced to flee back to their original homeland in upstate New York. At the same time the Iroquois were subjected to attacks by the French. This was the beginning of the end of the Iroquois Confederacy as they were put on the defensive. The Ojibwe expanded eastward, taking over the lands along the eastern shores of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.

In 1745, they adopted guns from the British in order to repel the Dakota people in the Lake Superior area, pushing them to the south and west. In the 1680s the Ojibwa defeated the Iroquois who dispersed their Huron allies and trading partners. This victory allowed them a &quot;golden age&quot; in which they ruled uncontested in southern Ontario.

Often, treaties known as &quot;peace and friendship treaties&quot; were made to establish community bonds between the Ojibwe and the European settlers. These established the groundwork for cooperative resource-sharing between the Ojibwe and the settlers. The United States and Canada viewed later treaties offering land cessions as offering territorial advantages. The Ojibwe did not understand the land cession terms in the same way because of the cultural differences in understanding the uses of land. The governments of the U.S. and Canada considered land a commodity of value that could be freely bought, owned and sold. The Ojibwe believed it was a fully shared resource, along with air, water and sunlight—despite having an understanding of &quot;territory&quot;. At the time of the treaty councils, they could not conceive of separate land sales or exclusive ownership of land. Consequently, today, in both Canada and the U.S., legal arguments in treaty-rights and treaty interpretations often bring to light the differences in cultural understanding of treaty terms to come to legal understanding of the treaty obligations.

In part because of their long trading alliance, the Ojibwe allied with the French against Great Britain and its colonists in the Seven Years&#x27; War (also called the French and Indian War). After losing the war in 1763, France was forced to cede its colonial claims to lands in Canada and east of the Mississippi River to Britain. After Pontiac&#x27;s War and adjusting to British colonial rule, the Ojibwe allied with British forces against the United States in the War of 1812. They had hoped that a British victory could protect them against United States settlers&#x27; encroachment on their territory.
Following the war, the United States government tried to forcibly remove all the Ojibwe to Minnesota, west of the Mississippi River. The Ojibwe resisted, and there were violent confrontations. In the Sandy Lake Tragedy, several hundred Ojibwe died because of the federal government&#x27;s failure to deliver fall annuity payments. The government attempted to do this in the Keweenaw Peninsula in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Through the efforts of Chief Buffalo and the rise of popular opinion in the U.S. against Ojibwe removal, the bands east of the Mississippi were allowed to return to reservations on ceded territory. A few families were removed to Kansas as part of the Potawatomi removal.

In British North America, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 following the Seven Years&#x27; War governed the cession of land by treaty or purchase. Subsequently, France ceded most of the land in Upper Canada to Great Britain. Even with the Jay Treaty signed between Great Britain and the United States following the American Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States did not fully uphold the treaty. As it was still preoccupied by war with France, Great Britain ceded to the United States much of the lands in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota and North Dakota to settle the boundary of their holdings in Canada.

In 1807, the Ojibwe joined three other tribes, the Odawa, Potawatomi and Wyandot people, in signing the Treaty of Detroit. The agreement, between the tribes and William Hull, representing the Michigan Territory, gave the United States a portion of today&#x27;s Southeastern Michigan and a section of Ohio near the Maumee River. The tribes were able to retain small pockets of land in the territory.

The Battle of the Brule was an October 1842 battle between the La Pointe Band of Ojibwe Indians and a war party of Dakota Indians. The battle took place along the Brule River (Bois Brûlé) in what is today northern Wisconsin and resulted in a decisive victory for the Ojibwe.

In Canada, many of the land cession treaties the British made with the Ojibwe provided for their rights for continued hunting, fishing and gathering of natural resources after land sales. The government signed numbered treaties in northwestern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. British Columbia had not signed treaties until the late 20th century, and most areas have no treaties yet. The government and First Nations are continuing to negotiate treaty land entitlements and settlements. The treaties are constantly being reinterpreted by the courts because many of them are vague and difficult to apply in modern times. The numbered treaties were some of the most detailed treaties signed for their time. The Ojibwe Nation set the agenda and negotiated the first numbered treaties before they would allow safe passage of many more British settlers to the prairies.

Ojibwe communities have a strong history of political and social activism. Long before contact, they were closely aligned with Odawa and Potawatomi people in the Council of the Three Fires. From the 1870s to 1938, the Grand General Indian Council of Ontario attempted to reconcile multiple traditional models into one cohesive voice to exercise political influence over colonial legislation. In the West, 16 Plains Cree and Ojibwe bands formed the Allied Bands of Qu&#x27;Appelle in 1910 in order to redress concerns about the failure of the government to uphold Treaty 4&#x27;s promises.

==Culture==
The Ojibwe have traditionally organized themselves into groups known as &quot;bands&quot;. Most Ojibwe, except for the Great Plains bands, have historically lived a settled (as opposed to nomadic) lifestyle, relying on fishing and hunting to supplement the cultivation of numerous varieties of maize and squash, and the harvesting of &quot;manoomin&quot; (wild rice) for food. Historically their typical dwelling has been the &quot;wiigiwaam&quot; (wigwam), built either as a &quot;waginogaan&quot; (domed-lodge) or as a &quot;nasawa&#x27;ogaan&quot; (pointed-lodge), made of birch bark, juniper bark and willow saplings. In the contemporary era, most of the people live in modern housing, but traditional structures are still used for special sites and events.

They have a culturally-specific form of pictorial writing, used in the religious rites of the &quot;Midewiwin&quot; and recorded on birch bark scrolls and possibly on rock. The many complex pictures on the sacred scrolls communicate much historical, geometrical, and mathematical knowledge, as well as images from their spiritual pantheon. The use of petroforms, petroglyphs, and pictographs has been common throughout the Ojibwe traditional territories. Petroforms and medicine wheels have been used to teach important spiritual concepts, record astronomical events, and to use as a mnemonic device for certain stories and beliefs. The script is still in use, among traditional people as well as among youth on social media.

Some ceremonies use the &quot;miigis&quot; shell (cowry shell), which is found naturally in distant coastal areas. Their use of such shells demonstrates there is a vast, longstanding trade network across the continent. The use and trade of copper across the continent has also been proof of a large trading network that took place for thousands of years, as far back as the Hopewell tradition. Certain types of rock used for spear and arrow heads have also been traded over large distances precontact.

During the summer months, the people attend &quot;jiingotamog&quot; for the spiritual and &quot;niimi&#x27;idimaa&quot; for a social gathering (powwows) at various reservations in the Anishinaabe-Aki (Anishinaabe Country). Many people still follow the traditional ways of harvesting wild rice, picking berries, hunting, making medicines, and making maple sugar.

The jingle dress that is typically worn by female pow wow dancers originated from the Ojibwe. Both Plains and Woodlands Ojibwe claim the earliest form of dark cloth dresses decorated with rows of tin cones - often made from the lids of tobacco cans- that make a jingling sound when worn by the dancer. This style of dress is now popular with all tribes and is a distinctly Ojibwe contribution to Pan-Indianism. 

The Ojibwe bury their dead in burial mounds. Many erect a &quot;jiibegamig&quot; or a &quot;spirit-house&quot; over each mound. An historical burial mound would typically have a wooden marker, inscribed with the deceased&#x27;s &quot;doodem&quot; (clan sign). Because of the distinct features of these burials, Ojibwe graves have been often looted by grave robbers. In the United States, many Ojibwe communities safe-guard their burial mounds through the enforcement of the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

Several Ojibwe bands in the United States cooperate in the Great Lakes Indian Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission, which manages the treaty hunting and fishing rights in the Lake Superior-Lake Michigan areas. The commission follows the directives of U.S. agencies to run several wilderness areas. Some Minnesota Ojibwe tribal councils cooperate in the 1854 Treaty Authority, which manages their treaty hunting and fishing rights in the Arrowhead Region. In Michigan, the Chippewa-Ottawa Resource Authority manages the hunting, fishing and gathering rights about Sault Ste. Marie, and the resources of the waters of lakes Michigan and Huron. In Canada, the Grand Council of Treaty No. 3 manages the Treaty 3 hunting and fishing rights related to the area around Lake of the Woods.

===Cuisine===

There is renewed interest in nutritious eating among the Ojibwe, who have been expanding community gardens in food deserts, and have started a mobile kitchen to teach their communities about nutritious food preparation. The traditional Native American diet was seasonally dependent on hunting, fishing and the foraging and farming of produce and grains. The modern diet has substituted some other types of food like frybread and &quot;Indian tacos&quot; in place of these traditionally prepared meals. The Native Americans loss of connection to their culture is part of the &quot;quest to reconnect to their food traditions&quot; sparking an interest in traditional ingredients like wild rice, that is the official state grain of Minnesota and Michigan, and was part of the pre-colonial diet of the Ojibwe. Other staple foods of the Ojibwe were fish, maple sugar, venison and corn. They grew beans, squash, corn and potatoes and foraged for blueberries, blackberries, choke cherries, raspberries, gooseberries and huckleberries. During the summer game animals like deer, beaver, moose, goose, duck, rabbits and bear were hunted.

One traditional method of making granulated sugar known among the Anishinabe was to boil maple syrup until reduced and pour into a trough, where the rapidly cooling syrup was quickly processed into maple sugar using wooden paddles.

===Kinship and clan system===

Traditionally, the Ojibwe had a patrilineal system, in which children were considered born to the father&#x27;s clan. For this reason, children with French or English fathers were considered outside the clan and Ojibwe society unless adopted by an Ojibwe male. They were sometimes referred to as &quot;white&quot; because of their fathers, regardless if their mothers were Ojibwe, as they had no official place in the Ojibwe society. The people would shelter the woman and her children, but they did not have the same place in the culture as children born to Ojibwe fathers.

Ojibwe understanding of kinship is complex and includes the immediate family as well as extended family. It is considered a modified bifurcate merging kinship system. As with any bifurcate-merging kinship system, siblings generally share the same kinship term with parallel cousins because they are all part of the same clan. The modified system allows for younger siblings to share the same kinship term with younger cross-cousins. Complexity wanes further from the person&#x27;s immediate generation, but some complexity is retained with female relatives. For example, &quot;ninooshenh&quot; is &quot;my mother&#x27;s sister&quot; or &quot;my father&#x27;s sister-in-law&quot;i.e., my parallel-aunt, but also &quot;my parent&#x27;s female cross-cousin&quot;. Great-grandparents and older generations, as well as great-grandchildren and younger generations, are collectively called &quot;aanikoobijigan&quot;. This system of kinship reflects the Anishinaabe philosophy of interconnectedness and balance among all living generations, as well as of all generations of the past and of the future.

The Ojibwe people were divided into a number of &quot;doodemag&quot; (clans; singular: &quot;doodem&quot;) named primarily for animals and birds totems (pronounced &quot;doodem&quot;). The word in the Ojibwe language means &quot;my fellow clansman.&quot; The five original totems were &quot;Wawaazisii&quot; (Bullhead), &quot;Baswenaazhi&quot;/&quot;Ajiijaak&quot; (&quot;Echo-maker&quot;, i.e., Crane), &quot;Aan&#x27;aawenh&quot; (Pintail Duck), &quot;Nooke&quot; (&quot;Tender&quot;, i.e., Bear) and &quot;Moozwaanowe&quot; (&quot;Little&quot; Moose-tail). The Crane totem was the most vocal among the Ojibwe, and the Bear was the largest – so large, that it was sub-divided into body parts such as the head, the ribs and the feet. Each clan had certain responsibilities among the people. People had to marry a spouse from a different clan.

Traditionally, each band had a self-regulating council consisting of leaders of the communities&#x27; clans, or &quot;odoodemaan&quot;. The band was often identified by the principal &quot;doodem&quot;. In meeting others, the traditional greeting among the Ojibwe people is, &quot;What is your &#x27;doodem&#x27;?&quot; (&quot;&quot;Aaniin gidoodem?&quot; or &quot;Awanen gidoodem?&quot;) The response allows the parties to establish social conduct by identifying as family, friends or enemies. Today, the greeting has been shortened to &quot;Aanii&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ah-nee&quot;).

===Spiritual beliefs===


The Ojibwe have spiritual beliefs that have been passed down by oral tradition under the Midewiwin teachings. These include a creation story and a recounting of the origins of ceremonies and rituals. Spiritual beliefs and rituals were very important to the Ojibwe because spirits guided them through life. Birch bark scrolls and petroforms were used to pass along knowledge and information, as well as for ceremonies. Pictographs were also used for ceremonies.

The sweatlodge is still used during important ceremonies about the four directions, when oral history is recounted. Teaching lodges are common today to teach the next generations about the language and ancient ways of the past. The traditional ways, ideas, and teachings are preserved and practiced in such living ceremonies.

The modern dreamcatcher, adopted by the Pan-Indian Movement and New Age groups, originated in the Ojibwe &quot;spider web charm&quot;, a hoop with woven string or sinew meant to replicate a spider&#x27;s web, used as a protective charm for infants. According to Ojibwe legend, the protective charms originate with the Spider Woman, known as &quot;Asibikaashi&quot;; who takes care of the children and the people on the land and as the Ojibwe Nation spread to the corners of North America it became difficult for Asibikaashi to reach all the children, so the mothers and grandmothers wove webs for the children, which had an apotropaic purpose and were not explicitly connected with dreams.

=== Funeral practices ===

==== Traditional ====
In Ojibwe tradition, the main task after a death is to bury the body as soon as possible, the very next day or even on the day of death. This was important because it allowed the spirit of the dead to journey to its place of joy and happiness. The land of happiness where the dead reside is called &quot;Gaagige Minawaanigozigiwining&quot;. This was a journey that took four days. If burial preparations could not be completed the day of the death, guests and medicine men were required to stay with the deceased and the family in order to help mourn, while also singing songs and dancing throughout the night. Once preparations were complete, the body would be placed in an inflexed position with their knees towards their chest. Over the course of the four days it takes the spirit to journey to its place of joy, it is customary to have food kept alongside the grave at all times. A fire is set when the sun sets and is kept going throughout the night. The food is to help feed the spirit over the course of the journey, while the smoke from the fire is a directional guide. Once the four–day journey is over, a feast is held, which is led by the chief medicine man. At the feast, it is the chief medicine man&#x27;s duty to give away certain belongings of the deceased. Those who were chosen to receive items from the deceased are required to trade in a new piece of clothing, all of which would be turned into a bundle. The bundle of new clothes and a dish is then given to the closest relative. The recipient of the bundle must then find individuals that he or she believes to be worthy, and pass on one of the new pieces of clothing.

==== Contemporary ====
According to Lee Staples, an Ojibwe spiritual leader from the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, present day practices follow the same spiritual beliefs and remain fairly similar. When an individual dies, a fire is lit in the home of the family, who are also expected to continuously maintain the fire for four days. Over the four days, food is also offered to the spirit. Added to food offerings, tobacco is also offered as it is considered one of four sacred medicines traditionally used by Ojibwe communities. On the last night of food offerings, a feast is also held by the relatives which ends with a final smoke of the offering tobacco or the tobacco being thrown in the fire. Although conventional caskets are mainly used in today&#x27;s communities, birch bark fire matches are buried along with the body as a tool to help light fires to guide their journey to &quot;Gaagige Minawaanigozigiwining&quot;.

===Ethnobotany===
Plants used by the Ojibwe include &quot;Agrimonia gryposepala&quot;, used for urinary problems, and &quot;Pinus strobus&quot;, the resin of which was used to treat infections and gangrene. The roots of &quot;Symphyotrichum novae-angliae&quot; are smoked in pipes to attract game. &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot; is eaten as part of Ojibwe cuisine. They also use a decoction as a quick-acting emetic. An infusion of the &quot;alba&quot; subspecies of &quot;Silene latifolia&quot; is used as physic. The South Ojibwa use a decoction of the root &quot;Viola canadensis&quot; for pains near the bladder. The Ojibwa are documented to use the root of &quot;Uvularia grandiflora&quot; for pain in the solar plexus, which may refer to pleurisy. They take a compound decoction of the root of &quot;Ribes glandulosum&quot; for back pain and for &quot;female weakness&quot;.

The Ojibwe eat the corms of &quot;Sagittaria cuneata&quot; for indigestion, and also as a food, eaten boiled fresh, dried or candied with maple sugar. Muskrat and beavers store them in large caches, which they have learned to recognize and appropriate. They take an infusion of the &quot;Antennaria howellii&quot; ssp. &quot;neodioica&quot; after childbirth to purge afterbirth and to heal. They use the roots of &quot;Solidago rigida&quot;, using a decoction of root as an enema and take an infusion of the root for &quot;stoppage of urine&quot;. They use &quot;Abies balsamea&quot;; melting the gum on warm stones and inhaling the fumes for headache. They also use a decoction of the root as an herbal steam for rheumatic joints. They also combine the gum with bear grease and use it as an ointment for hair. They use the needle-like leaves in as part of ceremony involving the sweatbath, and use the gum for colds and inhale the leaf smoke for colds. They use the plant as a cough medicine. The gum is used for sores and a compound containing leaves is used as wash. The liquid balsam from bark blisters is used for sore eyes. They boil the resin twice and add it to suet or fat to make a canoe pitch. The bark gum is taken for chest soreness from colds, applied to cuts and sores, and decoction of the bark is used to induce sweating. The bark gum is also taken for gonorrhea. A decoction (tea) of powdered, dried &quot;Onoclea sensibilis&quot; root is used to stimulate milk flow in female patients.

==Bands==
In his &quot;History of the Ojibway People&quot; (1855), William W. Warren recorded 10 major divisions of the Ojibwe in the United States. He mistakenly omitted the Ojibwe located in Michigan, western Minnesota and westward, and all of Canada. When identified major historical bands located in Michigan and Ontario are added, the count becomes 15:

<doc id="219066" wikidata="Q653123" url="?curid=219066" title="Arial">
<text>Arial is a sans-serif typeface in the neo-grotesque style. Fonts from the Arial family are included with all versions of Microsoft Windows after Windows 3.1, as well as in other Microsoft programs, Apple&#x27;s macOS, and many PostScript 3 printers. In Office 2007, Arial was replaced by Calibri as the default typeface in PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook.

The typeface was designed in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography. It is metrically compatible with Helvetica, enabling documents to use either typeface without affecting the visual layout. Because of their similar appearance, Arial and Helvetica are commonly mistaken for each other.

==Etymology==
The name Arial was derived from the word &quot;aerial&quot;, introduced as a trademark by Monotype.

== Design characteristics ==
Embedded in version 3.0 of the OpenType version of Arial is the following description of the typeface:
In 2005, Robin Nicholas said, &quot;It was designed as a generic sans serif; almost a bland sans serif.&quot;

Arial is a neo-grotesque typeface: a design based on nineteenth-century sans-serifs, but regularized to be more suited to continuous body text and to form a cohesive font family.

Apart from the need to match the character widths and approximate/general appearance of Helvetica, the letter shapes of Arial are also strongly influenced by Monotype&#x27;s own Monotype Grotesque designs—released in the 1920s or earlier Venus in the mid-1900s with additional influence from &quot;New Grotesque&quot;—an abortive redesign from 1956. The designs of the &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;r&quot; also resemble Gill Sans. The changes cause the typeface to nearly match Linotype Helvetica in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width. Monotype executive Allan Haley observed, &quot;Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves softer and fuller and the counters more open. The ends of the strokes on letters such as c, e, g and s, rather than being cut off on the horizontal, are terminated at the more natural angle in relation to the stroke direction.&quot; Matthew Carter, a consultant for IBM during its design process, described it as &quot;a Helvetica clone, based ostensibly on their Grots 215 and 216&quot;.

The styling of Arabic glyphs comes from Times New Roman, which have more varied stroke widths than the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic glyphs found in the font. Arial Unicode MS uses monotone stroke widths on Arabic glyphs, similar to Tahoma.

The Cyrillic, Greek and Coptic Spacing Modifier Letters glyphs initially introduced in Arial Unicode MS, but later debuted in Arial version 5.00, have different appearances.

== History ==

IBM debuted two printers for the in-office publishing market in 1982: the 240-DPI 3800-3 laserxerographic printer, and the 600-DPI 4250 electro-erosion laminate typesetter. Monotype was under contract to supply bitmap fonts for both printers. The fonts for the 4250, delivered to IBM in 1983, included Helvetica, which Monotype sub-licensed from Linotype. For the 3800–3, Monotype replaced Helvetica with Arial. The hand-drawn Arial artwork was completed in 1982 at Monotype by a 10-person team led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders 
and was digitized by Monotype at 240 DPI expressly for the 3800–3.

IBM named the font Sonoran Sans Serif due to licensing restrictions and the manufacturing facility&#x27;s location (Tucson, Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert), and announced in early 1984 that the Sonoran Sans Serif family, &quot;a functional equivalent of Monotype Arial&quot;, would be available for licensed use in the 3800-3 by the fourth quarter of 1984. There were initially 14 point sizes, ranging from 6 to 36, and four style/weight combinations (Roman medium, Roman bold, italic medium, and italic bold), for a total of 56 fonts in the family. Each contained 238 graphic characters, providing support for eleven national languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Monotype and IBM later expanded the family to include 300-DPI bitmaps and characters for additional languages.

In 1989, Monotype produced PostScript Type 1 outline versions of several Monotype fonts, but an official PostScript version of Arial was not available until 1991. In the meantime, a company called Birmy marketed a version of Arial in a Type 1-compatible format.

In 1990, Robin Nicholas, Patricia Saunders and Steve Matteson developed a TrueType outline version of Arial which was licensed to Microsoft.

In 1992, Microsoft chose Arial to be one of the four core TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1, announcing the font as an &quot;alternative to Helvetica&quot;. Matthew Carter has noted that the deal was complex and included a bailout of Monotype, which was in financial difficulties, by Microsoft. Microsoft would later extensively fund the development of Arial as a font that supported many languages and scripts. Monotype employee Rod McDonald noted:
 As to the widespread notion that Microsoft did not want to pay licensing fees [for Helvetica], [Monotype director] Allan Haley has publicly stated, more than once, that the amount of money Microsoft paid over the years for the development of Arial could finance a small country.

Arial ultimately became one of several clones of PostScript standard fonts created by Monotype in collaboration with or sold to Microsoft around this time, including Century Gothic (a clone of ITC Avant Garde), Book Antiqua (Palatino) and Bookman Old Style (ITC Bookman).

== Distribution ==

TrueType editions of Arial have shipped as part of Microsoft Windows since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992; Arial was the default font.

From 1999 until 2016, Microsoft Office shipped with Arial Unicode MS, a version of Arial that includes many international characters from the Unicode standard. This version of the typeface was for a time the most widely distributed pan-Unicode font. The font was dropped from Microsoft Office 2016 and has been deprecated; continuing growth of the number of characters in Unicode and limitations on the number of characters in a font meant that Arial Unicode could no longer perform the job it was originally created for.

Arial MT, a PostScript version of the Arial font family, was distributed with Acrobat Reader 4 and 5.

PostScript does not require support for a specific set of fonts, but Arial and Helvetica are among the 40 or so typeface families that PostScript Level 3 devices typically support.

Mac OS X (now known as macOS) was the first Mac OS version to include Arial; it was not included in classic Mac OS. The operating system ships with Arial, Arial Black, Arial Narrow, and Arial Rounded MT. However, the default macOS font for sans-serif/Swiss generic font family is Helvetica. The bundling of Arial with Windows and macOS has contributed to it being one of the most widely distributed and used typefaces in the world.

In 1996, Microsoft launched the Core fonts for the Web project to make a standard pack of fonts for the Internet. Arial in TrueType format was included in this project. The project allowed anyone to download and install these fonts for their own use (on end user&#x27;s computers) without any fee. The project was terminated by Microsoft in August 2002, allegedly due to frequent EULA violations. For MS Windows, the core fonts for the web were provided as self-extracting executables (.exe); each included an embedded cabinet file, which can be extracted with appropriate software. For the Macintosh, the files were provided as BinHexed StuffIt archives (.sit.hqx). The latest font version that was available from &quot;Core fonts for the Web&quot; was 2.82, published in 2000. Later versions (such as version 3 or version 5 which include many new characters) were not available from this project. A Microsoft spokesman declared in 2002 that members of the open-source community &quot;will have to find different sources for updated fonts. ... Although the EULA did not restrict the fonts to just Windows and Mac OS, they were only ever available as Windows .exe&#x27;s and Mac archive files.&quot; The chief technical officer of Opera Software cited the cancellation of the project as an example of Microsoft resisting interoperability.

== Arial variants ==
The known variants of Arial include:

* Arial: Sometimes called &quot;Arial Regular&quot; to distinguish its width from Arial Narrow, it contains Arial (Roman text weight), Arial Italic, Arial Bold, Arial Bold Italic
* Arial Unicode MS
* Arial Black: Arial Black, Arial Black Italic. This weight is known for being particularly heavy. This is because the face was originally drawn as a bitmap, and to increase the weight, stroke widths for bold went from a single pixel width to two pixels in width. It only supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.
* Arial Narrow: Arial Narrow Regular, Arial Narrow Bold, Arial Narrow Italic, Arial Narrow Bold Italic. This family is a condensed version.
* Arial Rounded: Arial Rounded Light, Arial Rounded Regular, Arial Rounded Medium, Arial Rounded Bold, Arial Rounded Extra Bold. The regular versions of the rounded glyphs can be found in Gulim, Microsoft&#x27;s Korean font set. Originally only available in bold form as Arial Rounded MT Bold, extra fonts appeared as retail products. In Linotype&#x27;s retail version, only Arial Rounded Regular supports WGL character set.
* Arial Special: Arial Special G1, Arial Special G2. They are included with Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, Expedia Streets and Trips 2000, MapPoint 2000.
* Arial Light, Arial Medium, Arial Extra Bold, Arial Light Condensed, Arial Condensed, Arial Medium Condensed, Arial Bold Condensed: These fonts first appeared in the Linotype online stores. The condensed fonts do not have italic counterparts.
* Arial Monospaced: In this monospaced variant, letters such as @, I (uppercase i), i, j, l (lowercase L), M, W are redesigned.

=== Arial Alternative ===
Arial Alternative Regular and Arial Alternative Symbol are standard fonts in Windows ME, and can also be found on Windows 95 and Windows XP installation discs, and on Microsoft&#x27;s site. Both fonts are Symbol-encoded. These fonts emulate the monospaced font used in Minitel/Prestel teletext systems, but vectorized with Arial styling. These fonts are used by HyperTerminal.

Arial Alternative Regular contains only ASCII characters, while Arial Alternative Symbol contains only 2 × 3 semigraphics characters.

=== Code page variants ===

Arial Baltic, Arial CE, Arial Cyr, Arial Greek, Arial Tur are aliases created in the FontSubstitutes section of WIN.INI by Windows. These entries all point to the master font. When an alias font is specified, the font&#x27;s character map contains different character set from the master font and the other alias fonts.

In addition, Monotype also sells Arial in reduced character sets, such as Arial CE, Arial WGL, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Greek, Arial Hebrew, Arial Thai.

Arial Unicode is a version supporting all characters assigned with Unicode 2.1 code points.

=== Arial Nova ===

Arial Nova&#x27;s design is based on the 1982&#x27;s Sonora Sans bitmapped fonts, which were in fact Arial renamed to avoid licensing issues. It was bundled with Windows 10 and up, and is offered free of charge on Microsoft Store. It contains Regular, Bold and Light weights, corresponding italics and corresponding Condensed widths.

== Monotype/Linotype retail versions ==

=== Arial ===

The TrueType core Arial fonts (Arial, Arial Bold, Arial Italic, Arial Bold Italic) support the same character sets as the version 2.76 fonts found in Internet Explorer 5/6, Windows 98/ME.

Version sold by Linotype includes Arial Rounded, Arial Monospaced, Arial Condensed, Arial Central European, Arial Central European Narrow, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Cyrillic Narrow, Arial Dual Greek, Arial Dual Greek Narrow, Arial SF, Arial Turkish, Arial Turkish Narrow.

In addition, Monotype also sells Arial in reduced character sets, such as Arial CE, Arial WGL, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Greek, Arial Hebrew, Arial Thai, Arial SF.

=== Arial WGL ===

It is a version that covers only the Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4) characters. They are only sold in TrueType format.

The family includes Arial (regular, bold, italics), Arial Black, Arial Narrow (regular, bold, italics), Arial Rounded (regular, bold).

=== Ascender Corporation fonts ===

Ascender Corporation sells the font in Arial WGL family, as well as the Arial Unicode.

== Arial in other font families ==

Arial glyphs are also used in fonts developed for non-Latin environments, including Arabic Transparent, BrowalliaUPC, Cordia New, CordiaUPC, Miriam, Miriam Transparent, Monotype Hei, and Simplified Arabic.

== Free alternatives ==
Arial is a proprietary typeface to which Monotype Imaging owns all rights, including software copyright and trademark rights (under U.S. copyright law, Monotype cannot legally copyright the shapes of the actual glyphs themselves). Its licensing terms prohibit derivative works and free redistribution.

There are some free software metric-compatible fonts used as free Arial alternatives or used for Arial font substitution:
* &quot;Liberation Sans&quot; is a metrically equivalent font to Arial developed by Ascender Corp. and published by Red Hat in 2007, initially under the GPL license with some exceptions. Versions 2.00.0 onwards are published under SIL Open Font License. It is used in some Linux distributions as default font replacement for Arial. Liberation Sans Narrow is a metrically equivalent font to Arial Narrow contributed to Liberation fonts by Oracle in 2010, but is not included in 2.00.0. Google commissioned a variation named &quot;Arimo&quot; for ChromeOS.
* URW++ produced a version of Helvetica called &quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot; in 1987, and it was eventually released under the GPL and AFPL (as Type 1 font for Ghostscript) in 1996. It is one of the Ghostscript fonts, free alternatives to 35 basic PostScript fonts (which include Helvetica).
* &quot;FreeSans&quot;, a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Sans L, which in turn descends from Helvetica. It is one of free fonts developed in GNU FreeFont project, first published in 2002. It is used in some free software as Arial replacement or for Arial font substitution.
* &quot;TeX Gyre Heros&quot;, a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Sans L, which in turn descends from Helvetica. It is one of free fonts developed by the Polish TeX Users Group (GUST), first published in 2007. It is licensed under the GUST Font License.

<text>Risk assessment determines possible mishaps, their likelihood and consequences, and the tolerances for such events. 
The results of this process may be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative fashion. Risk assessment is an inherent part of a broader risk management strategy to help reduce any potential risk-related consequences.
More precisely, risk assessment identifies and analyses potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e. hazard analysis). It also makes judgments &quot;on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis&quot; while considering influencing factors (i.e. risk evaluation).

==Categories==
===Individual risk assessment===
Risk assessments can be done in individual cases, including in patient and physician interactions. In the narrow sense chemical risk assessment is the assessment of a health risk in response to environmental exposures.
The ways statistics are expressed and communicated to an individual, both through words and numbers impact his or her interpretation of benefit and harm. For example, a fatality rate may be interpreted as less benign than the corresponding survival rate.
A systematic review of patients and doctors from 2017 found that overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks occurred more often than the alternative.
A systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration suggested &quot;well-documented decision aids&quot; are helpful in reducing effects of such tendencies or biases. Aids may help people come to a decision about their care based on evidence informed information that align with their values. Decision aids may also help people understand the risks more clearly, and they empower people to take an active role when making medical decisions. The systematic review did not find a difference in people who regretted their decisions between those who used decision aids and those who had the usual standard treatment. 

An individual´s own risk perception may be affected by psychological, ideological, religious or otherwise subjective factors, which impact rationality of the process. Individuals tend to be less rational when risks and exposures concern themselves as opposed to others. There is also a tendency to underestimate risks that are voluntary or where the individual sees themselves as being in control, such as smoking.

===Systems risk assessment===
Risk assessment can also be made on a much larger systems theory scale, for example assessing the risks of an ecosystem or an interactively complex mechanical, electronic, nuclear, and biological system or a hurricane (a complex meteorological and geographical system). Systems may be defined as linear and nonlinear (or complex), where linear systems are predictable and relatively easy to understand given a change in input, and non-linear systems unpredictable when inputs are changed. As such, risk assessments of non-linear/complex systems tend to be more challenging.

In the engineering of complex systems, sophisticated risk assessments are often made within safety engineering and reliability engineering when it concerns threats to life, natural environment, or machine functioning. The agriculture, nuclear, aerospace, oil, chemical, railroad, and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment. Also, medical, hospital, social service, and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.

== Concept ==
Rapid technological change, increasing scale of industrial complexes, increased system integration, market competition, and other factors have been shown to increase societal risk in the past few decades. As such, risk assessments become increasingly critical in mitigating accidents, improving safety, and improving outcomes. Risk assessment consists of an objective evaluation of risk in which assumptions and uncertainties are clearly considered and presented. This involves identification of risk (what can happen and why), the potential consequences, the probability of occurrence, the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce the probability of the risk. Optimally, it also involves documentation of the risk assessment and its findings, implementation of mitigation methods, and review of the assessment (or risk management plan), coupled with updates when necessary. Sometimes risks can be deemed acceptable, meaning the risk &quot;is understood and tolerated ... usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss.&quot;

=== Mild versus wild risk ===
Benoit Mandelbrot distinguished between &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; risk and argued that risk assessment and risk management must be fundamentally different for the two types of risk. Mild risk follows normal or near-normal probability distributions, is subject to regression to the mean and the law of large numbers, and is therefore relatively predictable. Wild risk follows fat-tailed distributions, e.g., Pareto or power-law distributions, is subject to regression to the tail (infinite mean or variance, rendering the law of large numbers invalid or ineffective), and is therefore difficult or impossible to predict. A common error in risk assessment and management is to underestimate the wildness of risk, assuming risk to be mild when in fact it is wild, which must be avoided if risk assessment and management are to be valid and reliable, according to Mandelbrot.

===Mathematical conceptualization===

To see the risk management process expressed mathematically, one can define expected risk as the sum over individual risks, formula_1, which can be computed as the product of potential losses, formula_2, and their probabilities, formula_3:
:formula_4
:formula_5
Even though for some risks formula_6, we might have formula_7, if the probability formula_8 is small compared to formula_3, its estimation might be based only on a smaller number of prior events, and hence, more uncertain. On the other hand, since formula_7, formula_11 must be larger than formula_2, so decisions based on this uncertainty would be more consequential, and hence, warrant a different approach.

This becomes important when we consider the variance of risk

:formula_13

as a large formula_2 changes the value.

Financial decisions, such as insurance, express loss in terms of dollar amounts. When risk assessment is used for public health or environmental decisions, the loss can be quantified in a common metric such as a country&#x27;s currency or some numerical measure of a location&#x27;s quality of life. For public health and environmental decisions, the loss is simply a verbal description of the outcome, such as increased cancer incidence or incidence of birth defects. In that case, the &quot;risk&quot; is expressed as
:formula_15
If the risk estimate takes into account information on the number of individuals exposed, it is termed a &quot;population risk&quot; and is in units of expected increased cases per time period. If the risk estimate does not take into account the number of individuals exposed, it is termed an &quot;individual risk&quot; and is in units of incidence rate per time period. Population risks are of more use for cost/benefit analysis; individual risks are of more use for evaluating whether risks to individuals are &quot;acceptable&quot;.

===Quantitative risk assessment===

In quantitative risk assessment, an annualized loss expectancy (ALE) may be used to justify the cost of implementing countermeasures to protect an asset. This may be calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE), which is the loss of value based on a single security incident, with the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO), which is an estimate of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability.

The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. Barry Commoner, Brian Wynne and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification. Furthermore, Commoner and O&#x27;Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures. Others, like Nassim Nicholas Taleb consider risk managers little more than &quot;blind users&quot; of statistical tools and methods.

== Process ==
Older textbooks distinguish between the term risk analysis and risk evaluation;
a risk analysis includes the following 4 steps:
* establish the context, which restricts the range of hazards to be considered. It is also necessary to identify the potential parties or assets which may be affected by the threat, and the potential consequences to them if the hazard is activated.
* hazard identification, an &quot;identification of visible and implied hazards&quot; and &quot;determining the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences&quot; of each hazard. Without a potential adverse consequence, there is no hazard.
* frequency analysis If a consequence is dependent on dose, i.e. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and severity of consequence must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.
* consequence analysis. For other hazards, the consequences may either occur or not, and the severity may be extremely variable even when the triggering conditions are the same. This is typical of many biological hazards as well as a large range of safety hazards. Exposure to a pathogen may or may not result in actual infection, and the consequences of infection may also be variable. Similarly, a fall from the same place may result in minor injury or death, depending on unpredictable details. In these cases, estimates must be made of reasonably likely consequences and associated probability of occurrence.

A risk evaluation means that judgements are made on the tolerability of the identified risks, leading to risk acceptance. When risk analysis and risk evaluation are made at the same time, it is called risk assessment.

As of 2023, chemical risk assessment follows these 4 steps:
* hazard characterization
* exposure assessment
* dose-response modeling
* risk characterization.
There is tremendous variability in the dose-response relationship between a chemical and human health outcome in particularly susceptible subgroups, such as pregnant women, developing fetuses, children up to adolescence, people with low socioeconomic status, those with preexisting diseases, disabilities, genetic susceptibility, and those with other environmental exposures.

The process of risk assessment may be somewhat informal at the individual social level, assessing economic and household risks, or a sophisticated process at the strategic corporate level. However, in both cases, ability to anticipate future events and create effective strategies for mitigating them when deemed unacceptable is vital.

At the individual level, identifying objectives and risks, weighing their importance, and creating plans, may be all that is necessary.
At the strategic organisational level, more elaborate policies are necessary, specifying acceptable levels of risk, procedures to be followed within the organisation, priorities, and allocation of resources.

At the strategic corporate level, management involved with the project produce project level risk assessments with the assistance of the available expertise as part of the planning process and set up systems to ensure that required actions to manage the assessed risk are in place. At the dynamic level, the personnel directly involved may be required to deal with unforeseen problems in real time. The tactical decisions made at this level should be reviewed after the operation to provide feedback on the effectiveness of both the planned procedures and decisions made in response to the contingency.

=== Dose dependent risk ===
# &quot;Dose-Response Analysis&quot;, is determining the relationship between dose and the type of adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. mouse, rat) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to genetics or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a no effect concentration. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the &quot;safe&quot; dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.
# &quot;Exposure Quantification&quot;, aims to determine the amount of a contaminant (dose) that individuals and populations will receive, either as a contact level (e.g., concentration in ambient air) or as intake (e.g., daily dose ingested from drinking water). This is done by examining the results of the discipline of exposure assessment. As a different location, lifestyle, and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range or distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s).

The results of these steps are combined to produce an estimate of risk. Because of the different susceptibilities and exposures, this risk will vary within a population. An uncertainty analysis is usually included in a health risk assessment.

== Dynamic risk assessment ==
During an emergency response, the situation and hazards are often inherently less predictable than for planned activities (non-linear). In general, if the situation and hazards are predictable (linear), standard operating procedures should deal with them adequately. In some emergencies, this may also hold true, with the preparation and trained responses being adequate to manage the situation. In these situations, the operator can manage risk without outside assistance, or with the assistance of a backup team who are prepared and available to step in at short notice.

Other emergencies occur where there is no previously planned protocol, or when an outsider group is brought in to handle the situation, and they are not specifically prepared for the scenario that exists but must deal with it without undue delay. Examples include police, fire department, disaster response, and other public service rescue teams. In these cases, ongoing risk assessment by the involved personnel can advise appropriate action to reduce risk. HM Fire Services Inspectorate has defined dynamic risk assessment (DRA) as:

Dynamic risk assessment is the final stage of an integrated safety management system that can provide an appropriate response during changing circumstances. It relies on experience, training and continuing education, including effective debriefing to analyse not only what went wrong, but also what went right, and why, and to share this with other members of the team and the personnel responsible for the planning level risk assessment.

==Fields of application==
The application of risk assessment procedures is common in a wide range of fields, and these may have specific legal obligations, codes of practice, and standardised procedures. Some of these are listed here.

=== General human health ===
There are many resources that provide human health risk information:

The National Library of Medicine provides risk assessment and regulation information tools for a varied audience. These include:
* TOXNET (databases on hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases),
* the Household Products Database (potential health effects of chemicals in over 10,000 common household products),
* TOXMAP (maps of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund and Toxics Release Inventory data).

The United States Environmental Protection Agency provides basic information about environmental health risk assessments for the public for a wide variety of possible environmental exposures.

The Environmental Protection Agency began actively using risk assessment methods to protect drinking water in the United States after the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The law required the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on drinking water issues, and in its report, the NAS described some methodologies for doing risk assessments for chemicals that were suspected carcinogens, recommendations that top EPA officials have described as perhaps the study&#x27;s most important part.

Considering the increase in junk food and its toxicity, FDA required in 1973 that cancer-causing compounds must not be present in meat at concentrations that would cause a cancer risk greater than 1 in a million over a lifetime. The US Environmental Protection Agency provides extensive information about ecological and environmental risk assessments for the public via its risk assessment portal. The Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) supports a qualitative risk framework for public health protection from chemicals that display environmental and biological persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity (PBT) and long range transport; most global chemicals that meet this criterion have been previously assessed quantitatively by national and international health agencies.

For non-cancer health effects, the terms reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC) are used to describe the safe level of exposure in a dichotomous fashion. Newer ways of communicating the risk is the probabilistic risk assessment.

==== Small sub-populations ====
When risks apply mainly to small sub-populations, it can be difficult to determine when intervention is necessary. For example, there may be a risk that is very low for everyone, other than 0.1% of the population. It is necessary to determine whether this 0.1% is represented by:
* all infants younger than &quot;X&quot; days or
* recreational users of a particular product.

If the risk is higher for a particular sub-population because of abnormal exposure rather than susceptibility, strategies to further reduce the exposure of that subgroup are considered. If an identifiable sub-population is more susceptible due to inherent genetic or other factors, public policy choices must be made. The choices are:
* to set policies for protecting the general population that are protective of such groups, e.g. for children when data exists, the Clean Air Act for populations such as asthmatics or
* not to set policies, because the group is too small, or the costs too high.

==== Acceptable risk criteria ====
Acceptable risk is a risk that is understood and tolerated usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss.

The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy. It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially &quot;acceptable&quot; if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk. Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives, or other chemicals.

In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives. There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no incineration is the potential spread of infectious diseases or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

Intelligent thought about a reasonably full set of options is essential. Thus, it is not unusual for there to be an iterative process between analysis, consideration of options, and follow up analysis.

=== Public health ===
In the context of public health, risk assessment is the process of characterizing the nature and likelihood of a harmful effect to individuals or populations from certain human activities. Health risk assessment can be mostly qualitative or can include statistical estimates of probabilities for specific populations. In most countries, the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities (e.g. power plants, manufacturing plants) is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specific threshold. For example, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food safety through risk assessment, while the EFSA does the same in EU.

An occupational risk assessment is an evaluation of how much potential danger a hazard can have to a person in a workplace environment. The assessment takes into account possible scenarios in addition to the probability of their occurrence and the results. The six types of hazards to be aware of are safety (those that can cause injury), chemicals, biological, physical, psychosocial (those that cause stress, harassment) and ergonomic (those that can cause musculoskeletal disorders). To appropriately access hazards there are two parts that must occur. Firstly, there must be an &quot;exposure assessment&quot; which measures the likelihood of worker contact and the level of contact. Secondly, a &quot;risk characterization&quot; must be made which measures the probability and severity of the possible health risks.
=== Human settlements ===
The importance of risk assessments to manage the consequences of climate change and variability is recalled in the global frameworks for disaster risk reduction, adopted by the member countries of the United Nations at the end of the World Conferences held in Kobe (2005) and Sendai (2015). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction brings attention to the local scale and encourages a holistic risk approach, which should consider all the hazards to which a community is exposed, the integration of technical-scientific knowledge with local knowledge, and the inclusion of the concept of risk in local plans to achieve a significant disaster reduction by 2030. Taking these principles into daily practice poses a challenge for many countries. The Sendai framework monitoring system highlights how little is known about the progress made from 2015 to 2019 in local disaster risk reduction.

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
As of 2019, in the South of the Sahara, risk assessment is not yet an institutionalized practice. The exposure of human settlements to multiple hazards (hydrological and agricultural drought, pluvial, fluvial and coastal floods) is frequent and requires risk assessments on a regional, municipal, and sometimes individual human settlement scale. The multidisciplinary approach and the integration of local and technical-scientific knowledge are necessary from the first steps of the assessment. Local knowledge remains unavoidable to understand the hazards that threaten individual communities, the critical thresholds in which they turn into disasters, for the validation of hydraulic models, and in the decision-making process on risk reduction. On the other hand, local knowledge alone is not enough to understand the impacts of future changes and climatic variability and to know the areas exposed to infrequent hazards.
The availability of new technologies and open access information (high resolution satellite images, daily rainfall data) allow assessment today with an accuracy that only 10 years ago was unimaginable. The images taken by unmanned vehicle technologies allow to produce very high resolution digital elevation models and to accurately identify the receptors. Based on this information, the hydraulic models allow the identification of flood areas with precision even at the scale of small settlements. The information on loss and damages and on cereal crop at individual settlement scale allow to determine the level of multi-hazard risk on a regional scale.The multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images allow to assess the hydrological drought and the dynamics of human settlements in the flood zone.
Risk assessment is more than an aid to informed decision making about risk reduction or acceptance. It integrates early warning systems by highlighting the hot spots where disaster prevention and preparedness are most urgent. When risk assessment considers the dynamics of exposure over time, it helps to identify risk reduction policies that are more appropriate to the local context.
Despite these potentials, the risk assessment is not yet integrated into the local planning in the South of the Sahara which, in the best of cases, uses only the analysis of vulnerability to climate change and variability.

===Auditing===
For audits performed by an outside audit firm, risk assessment is a crucial stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 &quot;Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement&quot;, &quot;the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control&quot;. Evidence relating to the auditor&#x27;s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client&#x27;s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client&#x27;s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection Risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows: inherent risk × control risk × detection risk.

===Project management===
In project management, risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management plan, studying the probability, the impact, and the effect of every known risk on the project, as well as the corrective action to take should an incident be implied by a risk occur. Of special consideration in this area are the relevant codes of practice that are enforced in the specific jurisdiction. Understanding the regime of regulations that risk management must abide by is integral to formulating safe and compliant risk assessment practices.

=== Information security ===
Information technology risk assessment can be performed by a qualitative or quantitative approach, following different methodologies. One important difference in risk assessments in information security is modifying the threat model to account for the fact that any adversarial system connected to the Internet has access to threaten any other connected system. Risk assessments may therefore need to be modified to account for the threats from all adversaries, instead of just those with reasonable access as is done in other fields.

NIST Definition: The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information system. Part of risk management incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses and considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in place.

There are various risk assessment methodologies and frameworks available which include NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT), Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR), Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE), The Center for Internet Security Risk Assessment Method (CIS RAM), and The Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) Standard, which helps define &#x27;reasonable&#x27; security.

=== Cybersecurity ===

The Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) process is part of risk management referring to risks related to cyber threats. The TRA process will identify cyber risks, assess risks&#x27; severities, and may recommend activities to reduce risks to an acceptable level.

There are different methodologies for performing TRA (e.g., Harmonized TRA Methodology), all utilize the following elements: identifying of assets (what should be protected), identifying and assessing of the threats and vulnerabilities for the identified assets, determining the exploitability of the vulnerabilities, determining the levels of risk associated with the vulnerabilities (what are the implications if the assets were damaged or lost), and recommending a risk mitigation program.

=== Megainvestment projects ===
Megaprojects (sometimes also called &quot;major programs&quot;) are extremely large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project. They include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.

=== Software evolution ===
Studies have shown that early parts of the system development cycle such as requirements and design specifications are especially prone to error. This effect is particularly notorious in projects involving multiple stakeholders with different points of view. Evolutionary software processes offer an iterative approach to requirement engineering to alleviate the problems of uncertainty, ambiguity, and inconsistency inherent in software developments, including uncertainty, ambiguity, and inconsistency inherent in software developments.

=== Shipping industry ===
In July 2010, shipping companies agreed to use standardized procedures in order to assess risk in key shipboard operations. These procedures were implemented as part of the amended ISM Code.

=== Underwater diving ===

Formal risk assessment is a required component of most professional dive planning, but the format and methodology may vary. Consequences of an incident due to an identified hazard are generally chosen from a small number of standardised categories, and probability is estimated based on statistical data on the rare occasions when it is available, and on a best guess estimate based on personal experience and company policy in most cases. A simple risk matrix is often used to transform these inputs into a level of risk, generally expressed as unacceptable, marginal or acceptable. If unacceptable, measures must be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and the outcome of the risk assessment must be accepted by the affected parties before a dive commences. Higher levels of risk may be acceptable in special circumstances, such as military or search and rescue operations when there is a chance of recovering a survivor. Diving supervisors are trained in the procedures of hazard identification and risk assessment, and it is part of their planning and operational responsibility. Both health and safety hazards must be considered. Several stages may be identified. There is risk assessment done as part of the diving project planning, on site risk assessment which takes into account the specific conditions of the day, and dynamic risk assessment which is ongoing during the operation by the members of the dive team, particularly the supervisor and the working diver.

In recreational scuba diving, the extent of risk assessment expected of the diver is relatively basic and is included in the pre-dive checks. Several mnemonics have been developed by diver certification agencies to remind the diver to pay some attention to risk, but the training is rudimentary. Diving service providers are expected to provide a higher level of care for their customers, and diving instructors and divemasters are expected to assess risk on behalf of their customers and warn them of site-specific hazards and the competence considered appropriate for the planned dive. Technical divers are expected to make a more thorough assessment of risk, but as they will be making an informed choice for a recreational activity, the level of acceptable risk may be considerably higher than that permitted for occupational divers under the direction of an employer.

===Outdoor and wilderness adventure===
In outdoor activities including commercial outdoor education, wilderness expeditions, and outdoor recreation, risk assessment refers to the analysis of the probability and magnitude of unfavorable outcomes such as injury, illness, or property damage due to environmental and related causes, compared to the human development or other benefits of outdoor activity. This is of particular importance as school programs and others weigh the benefits of youth and adult participation in various outdoor learning activities against the inherent and other hazards present in those activities. Schools, corporate entities seeking team-building experiences, parents/guardians, and others considering outdoor experiences expect or require organizations to assess the hazards and risks of different outdoor activities—such as sailing, target shooting, hunting, mountaineering, or camping—and select activities with acceptable risk profiles.

Outdoor education, wilderness adventure, and other outdoor-related organizations should, and are in some jurisdictions required, to conduct risk assessments prior to offering programs for commercial purposes.

Such organizations are given guidance on how to provide their risk assessments.

Risk assessments for led outdoor activities form only one component of a comprehensive risk management plan, as many risk assessments use a basic linear-style thinking that does not employ more modern risk management practice employing complex socio-technical systems theory.

=== Environment ===
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims to assess the effects of stressors, usually chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of the likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario. This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a no-effect level, such as the Predicted Environmental Concentration/Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold. New approaches start to be developed in ERA in order to quantify this risk and to communicate effectively on it with both the managers and the general public.

Ecological risk assessment is complicated by the fact that there are many nonchemical stressors that substantially influence ecosystems, communities, and individual plants and animals, as well as across landscapes and regions. Defining the undesired (adverse) event is a political or policy judgment, further complicating applying traditional risk analysis tools to ecological systems. Much of the policy debate surrounding ecological risk assessment is over defining precisely what is an adverse event.

=== Biodiversity ===
Biodiversity Risk Assessments evaluate risks to biological diversity, specially the risk of species extinction or the risk of ecosystem collapse. The units of assessments are the biological (species, subspecies or populations) or ecological entities (habitats, ecosystems, etc.), and the risk are often related to human actions and interventions (threats and pressures). Regional and national protocols have been proposed by multiple academic or governmental institutions and working groups, but global standards such as the Red List of Threatened Species and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems have been widely adopted, and are recognized or proposed as official indicators of progress toward international policy targets and goals, such as the Aichi targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.

=== Law ===
Risk assessments are used in numerous stages during the legal process and are developed to measure a wide variety of items, such as recidivism rates, potential pretrial issues, probation/parole, and to identify potential interventions for defendants. Clinical psychologists, forensic psychologists, and other practitioners are responsible for conducting risk assessments. Depending on the risk assessment tool, practitioners are required to gather a variety of background information on the defendant or individual being assessed. This information includes their previous criminal history (if applicable) and other records (i.e. Demographics, Education, Job Status, Medical History), which can be accessed through direct interview with the defendant or on-file records.

In the pre-trial stage, a widely used risk assessment tool is the Public Safety Assessment, which predicts failure to appear in court, likelihood of a new criminal arrest while on pretrial release, and likelihood of a new violent criminal arrest while on pretrial release. Multiple items are observed and taken into account based on which aspect of the PSA is being focused, and like all other actuarial risk assessments, each item is assigned a weighted amount to produce a final score. Detailed information such as transparency on the items the PSA factors and how scores are distributed are accessible online.

For defendants who have been incarcerated, risk assessments are used to determine their likelihood of recidivism and inform sentence length decisions. Risk assessments also aid parole/probation officers in determining the level of supervision a probationer should be subjected to and what interventions could be implemented to improve offender risk status. The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) is a risk assessment too designed to measure pretrial release risk, general recidivism risk, and violent recidivism risk. Detailed information on scoring and algorithms for COMPAS are not accessible to the general public.

<text>Anton Paul Stadler (28 June 1753, in Bruck an der Leitha – 15 June 1812, in Vienna) was an Austrian clarinet and basset horn player for whom Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote, amongst others, both his Clarinet Quintet (K 581) and Clarinet Concerto (K 622). Stadler&#x27;s name is inextricably linked to Mozart&#x27;s compositions for these two instruments.

== Early life and career ==
Stadler was born in 1753 in a small town near Vienna; in 1756 his family moved into the city where his brother Johann was born. Even though both became famous as clarinet and basset horn players, the &quot;Journal des Luxus und der Moden&quot; described Anton in 1801 as &#x27;a great artist on many wind instruments&#x27;, and in a letter to Ignatz von Beecke, applying for a position in the Wallerstein orchestra (6 November 1781), Anton himself writes that they &#x27;can also play a little violin and viol&#x27;. In the same letter he stated that both he and his brother &#x27;could supplement orchestral skills with duets, concertos, wind octets and basset horn trios&#x27;, the latter together with Raymund Griesbacher.

A concert on 21 March 1773 at the Kärntnertortheater, of which a programme survived, appears to mark the first public appearance of the two brothers in Vienna; further recorded appearances include a concert on 19 December 1775 and two concerts (12 and 14 March 1780) in which they took part in a concerto for five winds by Joseph Starzer. Pamela Poulin writes: Until 1782 Anton and Johann held various positions. According to the open account books of the imperial court of 1779 they were hired by the court on a per-service basis. A concert programme of 12 March identifies the brothers as being in the service of Count Carl of Palm. As of October 1780 Anton was employed by the Piaristen religious order of Maria Treu as a &#x27;manorial musician&#x27;. In 1781 Anton was in the service of count Dimitri Galizin. In the same year Kaiser Joseph II designated their services as &#x27;indispensable&#x27;.

== Stadler and Mozart ==
Mozart&#x27;s first encounter with Stadler may have been around 1781, following his own move to Vienna. In October 1781 he wrote of the first performance of the sextet version of his E-flat Serenade K 375: &quot;The six gentlemen who executed it are poor beggars who, however, play quite well together, particularly the first clarinet and the two horns.&quot; On 8 February 1782 the Stadlers were invited to join the orchestra of the Viennese imperial court, and the following year they were members of the emperor&#x27;s &quot;Harmonie&quot;, in which Stadler played second clarinet. Stadler&#x27;s evident preoccupation with the chalumeau register(the lowest range a clarinet can be played at) is significant in view of Mozart&#x27;s subsequent exploitation of its idiomatic potential.

The earliest &quot;documented&quot; evidence of Mozart&#x27;s connection with Stadler dates from a year or two later. The clarinetist&#x27;s playing evoked the following response in Johann Friedrich Schink&#x27;s &quot;Litterarische Fragmente&quot;: My thanks to you, brave virtuoso! I have never heard the like of what you contrived with your instrument. Never should I have thought that a clarinet could be capable of imitating the human voice as it was imitated by you. Indeed, your instrument has so soft and lovely a tone that no one can resist it – and I have one, dear Virtuoso; let me thank you. I heard music for wind instruments today, too, by Herr Mozart, in four movements, viz. four horns, two oboes, two bassoons, two clarinets, two basset horns, a double bass, and at each instrument sat a master – oh, what a glorious effect it made – glorious and great, excellent and sublime! Schink here clearly refers to a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Serenade for thirteen instruments K 361/370a, which probably formed part of Stadler&#x27;s benefit concert at the National Court Theatre advertised in the &quot;Wienerblättchen&quot; of 22 March 1784: &quot;Herr Stadler senior, in present service of His Majesty the Emperor, will hold a musical concert for his own benefit, at which will be given, among other well chosen pieces, a great wind piece of a very special kind composed by Herr Mozart.&quot; Barely more than a week after this first documented performance came the première of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Quintet K 452 on 1 April, which included parts for both composer and clarinettist.

The arrival in Vienna of the Bohemian players Anton David and Vincent Springer proved an important catalyst for Mozart&#x27;s basset horn writing. They had already generated considerable publicity as early as 1782, when their performance at Ludwigslust &#x27;on largely unknown instruments which they call basset horns&#x27; was cited by C.F. Cramer the following year. Mozart&#x27;s espousal of the basset horn really began in earnest in late 1783 when he produced over a period of two years thirteen works for that instrument:
* the Notturni K 436, 437, 438, 439 and 346/439a
* 25 pieces for three basset horns K 439b
* the Masonic funeral music K 477/479a
* the Adagio in B-flat K 411/484a for two clarinets and three basset horns
* the Adagio in F K 410/484d for two basset horns and bassoon
* a fragment of a Quintet in B-flat for keyboard, oboe, clarinet, basset horn and bassoon (K 452a)
* a fragment of an Allegro assai in B-flat for two clarinets and three basset horns (K 484b), possibly linked to K 411/484a
* a fragment of an Adagio in F for clarinet and three basset horns (K 484c), possibly linked to K 580a
* a fragment of an Allegro in F (K 484e), possibly for basset horn
The latter dates from the end of 1785. This remarkable activity was undoubtedly brought about by the availability of four excellent clarinet and basset horn players – the Stadlers, David and Springer – who in combination must have inspired the scoring of Mozart&#x27;s Serenade K 361/370a, in addition to more ritualistic works such as the Adagio K 411/484a. Indeed, the basset horn came to be associated with Masonic ritual, for which its special character was ideally suited, and Anton Stadler was admitted to the &#x27;Zum Palmbaum&#x27; (&#x27;Palm Tree&#x27;) lodge on 27 September 1785. On 20 October of that year he and Mozart performed at a benefit concert (to pay for David&#x27;s and Springer&#x27;s journey home) organised by the Palm Tree and Three Eagles lodges of the Viennese Masonic order, and on 17 November Mozart&#x27;s most important piece of Masonic music, the &quot;Maurerische Trauermusik&quot; K 477/479a, was performed during a Lodge of Sorrows for the deaths of two Brothers, Georg August, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Franz, Count Esterhazy of Galántha. For this piece Mozart used an extraordinary and fortuitous collection of musicians: the clarinet part was probably intended for Stadler and the contrabassoon part for Theodor Lotz. The initial scoring also included a single basset horn, but two more were added by Mozart, presumably to allow the participation of David and Springer. Stadler and Mozart appeared again at another benefit concert for the Bohemian pair at the Crowned Hope Lodge on 15 December 1785, for which the items included &#x27;A Parthie [suite] composed by Brother Stadler for six wind instruments, for which the Hon. Brother Locz [&quot;sic&quot;] will play the great octave bassoon&#x27;; Stadler&#x27;s Partita is no longer extant. Significantly, Mozart wrote nothing further for the basset horn after this concert until 1788, when he produced a piano concerto fragment (K 537b) and the Canzonetta K 549.

Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Trio K 498 was written for the pianist Francesca von Jacquin and must have been first played at the family house, with the participation of Stadler and the composer himself. It undoubtedly reflects the favourite techniques and idioms of each of the players, including Stadler&#x27;s proficiency in the chalumeau register, as illustrated by accompaniment figuration and melodic figures including that part of the compass.

Mozart&#x27;s opera La clemenza di Tito (K 621) was first heard in Prague on 6 September 1791. Although the orchestra was that of the Estates Theatre, Stadler travelled to Prague with Mozart, who included two arias with major solos for him: Sesto&#x27;s &quot;Parto, parto&quot;, which has a large basset clarinet solo, and Vitellia&#x27;s &quot;Non più di fiori&quot;, which has a basset horn solo of equal prominence.

Although the eloquence of Mozart&#x27;s clarinet writing for Stadler testifies to a remarkable musical relationship, surviving evidence of their personal friendship remains fragmentary. In any case, Mozart&#x27;s nickname for the clarinettist reveals a shared sense of humour; &#x27;Notschibinitschibi&#x27; is a combination of two words – &#x27;Notschibi&#x27; meaning a poor booby or miser and &#x27;Nitschibi&#x27; a young man of follies. Still, much evidence remains to show that Stadler was at best irresponsible, and at worst, conniving. Constanze Mozart&#x27;s sister, Sophie Haibel, recounted to Georg Nikolaus von Nissen how Stadler stole from Mozart, and a letter from Constanze to the publisher Johann André suggests that she and others held no high opinion of him. Furthermore, although Theodor Lotz made Stadler&#x27;s basset clarinets (see below), Stadler later attributed their invention to himself, taking advantage of Lotz&#x27;s premature death in 1792, only six months after Mozart&#x27;s. Stadler never paid for the instruments, nor for K 622, which Nissen claims was commissioned from Mozart. It is distressing to see to what extent Mozart involved Stadler in his personal life and finances, considering how often the composer himself was in debt.

In the end, though, there can be no doubt that Stadler&#x27;s character struck a chord deep in Mozart, who was very fond of him. For this we must be grateful: Mozart&#x27;s close friendship with Stadler and Lotz have given clarinettists some of the most sublime music imaginable.

== Stadler and the basset clarinet ==
A surviving programme for a concert on 20 February 1788 documents an important milestone in the history of Stadler and Mozart, heralding the arrival of a newly extended clarinet. It announces a concert at the Hoftheater at which Herr Stadler the elder, in the service of his majesty the Kaiser, will play a concerto on the &quot;Bass-Klarinet&quot; and a variation on the &quot;Bass-Klarinet&quot;, an instrument of new invention and manufacture of the court instrument maker Theodor Loz [&quot;sic&quot;]; this instrument has two more tones than the normal clarinet. Stadler&#x27;s instrument is now known as a basset clarinet, a term coined by Jiři Kratochvil to reflect its kinship with the basset horn and to avoid confusion with the bass clarinet, whose orchestral career developed only during the 19th century. As for the variations advertised in Stadler&#x27;s 1788 programme, a number of works have so far been identified, including &quot;Variations on different favourite themes&quot; and ten variations on &quot;You must not take amiss with me&quot;. A possible candidate for the other clarinet work might be another of Stadler&#x27;s compositions, or perhaps a B-flat major Concerto attributed to Joseph Michl.

The &quot;two more tones than the normal clarinet [the compass of which ends at low &quot;e&quot;]&quot; mentioned in the concert programme can, however, not easily be unambiguously identified. The Lotz basset clarinet must be associated with Mozart&#x27;s Quintet fragment in B-flat K 516c, 93 bars of a movement which in 1828 Nissen believed to have been originally complete. Basset notes occur only from bar 55, &quot;d&quot; then occurring 7 times, occasioning notation in the bass clef an octave below pitch, as in Mozart&#x27;s basset horn writing. Similarly, the second clarinet part of Ferrando&#x27;s aria &#x27;Ah lo veggio&#x27; from &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; descends to &quot;d&quot; on a total of 7 occasions. Mozart&#x27;s avoidance of the tonic &quot;c&quot; has led some writers to assume that &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e-flat&quot; were the extra notes on Lotz&#x27;s instrument, but the obvious parallel with the basset horn makes &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; much more likely: Robert D. Levin reconstructed K 516c and believes that the missing portion must have contained several examples of low &quot;c&quot;.

It was for this extended clarinet that the &quot;Clarinet Concerto&quot; and possibly the &quot;Quintet for Clarinet and Strings&quot; were written. A concerto in D major for basset clarinet was written for Stadler by Franz Xaver Süssmayr, which remains as two incomplete manuscripts. It is now thought that the clarinet concerti by Joseph Leopold Eybler and Leopold Kozeluch were also written for Anton Stadler.

== Later life and career ==
In a letter to Constanze from October 1791 Mozart writes of completing the final movement of K 622 (&#x27;Stadler&#x27;s Rondo&#x27;) and Stadler set out on a concert tour that lasted about four years, during which time he visited at least nine cities, performing more than a dozen times:
*Prague, 16 October 1791
*Berlin, 31 January and 23 March 1792
*Warsaw, 4 May and 11 September 1792
*Vilniu, 1793
*Riga, 27 February 5 and 21 March 1794
*St Petersburg, 13 May 1794
*Lübeck, 16 and 27 September 1794
*Hamburg, 29 November and 20 December 1794
*Hannover, 12 September 1795
Making use of his status as a Royal Imperial Court Musician from Vienna he presumably also gave lessons. Reviews of Stadler&#x27;s playing are generally flattering, such as comments in the Berlin &quot;Musikalisches Wochenblatt&quot; of 1792, where he is described as &#x27;brilliant and accomplished; he also has acquired a precision which shows his confidence&#x27;.

By 1796 Stadler had returned to Vienna, taking up his post alongside his brother, and starting composing works for basset horn and clarinet, a number of which were published. In 1798 the Viennese composer Joseph Leopold Eybler complete a clarinet concerto, very probably for Anton Stadler, a fine three-movement work with a full orchestra complete with &quot;Harmonie&quot; (including clarinets), trumpets and timpani, in which the &quot;tutti&quot; sections demonstrate Eybler&#x27;s fine compositional technique. In the concerto manuscript, two versions of the solo part are written on separate staves: they vary in their technical demands and it seems a player may have found the upper line too difficult (most of the passage work lies in the extreme high register, up to a3) and persuaded the composer to make a simplified version.

Stadler was invited by a Hungarian count, Georg Festitics, to help organize a school of music in Keszthely near the Plattensee. The result, Stadler&#x27;s 50-page &quot;Musick Plan&quot; of 1800, represents a thoughtful and organized side of Stadler one might not have suspected to exist (the original is preserved in the National Hungarian Library in Budapest). The document, based on a set of questions provided by the count, recommends a rigorous education, combining performance, music theory and composition with schooling in a broad range of subjects. Examples of Stadler&#x27;s priorities include study of the violin, singing and piano (also requiring students to learn to tune a piano), a &#x27;general education&#x27; (because otherwise one becomes a &#x27;half thing&#x27;), as well as an understanding of the psychology of performance. He also has wise words on how to behave in the profession, suggesting instrumentalists &#x27;not to drown out singers, not hold back or press forward in tempo, not publicly censure another&#x27;s chance mistake, nor ridicule their colleagues&#x27;. A list of repertoire and theoretical texts is found at the end of the document, and includes mention of a forthcoming method for the clarinet, to be written by Stadler himself. The &quot;Musick Plan&quot; serves to habilitate Stadler&#x27;s reputation, at least partially.

After his four-year tour he left his wife for a young seamstress, Friederika Kabel, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. No doubt he spent money irresponsibly and continued to incur debts. He died of emaciation and was buried on 17 June 1812 on the old Catholic cemetery in Matzleinsdorf.

<text>Steffen Tangstad (22 June 1959 – 26 June 2024) was a Norwegian professional boxer and two-time European Heavyweight Champion.

Tangstad fought Michael Spinks for the IBF Heavyweight title on 6 September 1986, losing as a result of a fourth-round knockout.
That was Tangstad&#x27;s final bout. He retired with a career record of 24 wins (14 by knockout), 2 losses and 2 draws.

After retiring from the boxing ring, Tangstad began a career in Norwegian television and was the CEO of the now defunct &quot;Modern Sports &amp; Events&quot; (MSE), which was licensed to broadcast UFC pay-per-view events in Scandinavia.

In 2006, he participated in the second season of &quot;Skal vi danse?&quot;.

Tangstad died after a long illness on 26 June 2024, at the age of 65. He had had his leg amputated three years before.
He had been struggling with peripheral neuropathy, and had lost the use of his hands, arms and legs.

<doc id="219090" wikidata="Q1332780" url="?curid=219090" title="Tony Tucker">
<text>Tony Craig Tucker (born December 27, 1958) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 1998. He won the IBF heavyweight title in 1987, and was the shortest-reigning world heavyweight champion at just 64 days. In an interview with Barry Tompkins, he referred to himself as the &quot;invisible champion,&quot; due to the press and general public largely neglecting him. He is best known for giving Mike Tyson in his prime a relatively close fight, in which he, in the words of Larry Merchant, &quot;rocked Tyson&quot; in the first round. However, Tyson went on to win a unanimous decision. As an amateur, he won the 1979 United States national championships, the 1979 World Cup, and a gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games, all in the light heavyweight division.

==Amateur career==
Tony Tucker became a boxer under influence of his father Bob Tucker, also a former amateur boxer, who became his trainer and manager, put all his wealth into the development of his son&#x27;s boxing career. Tony fought out of Grand Rapids, Michigan, competing almost his entire amateur career in the light heavyweight division with his billed weight at the 1979 Pan American Games exactly matching the weight limit of the division (178 lbs).

Robert Surkein, the national boxing chairman for the Amateur Athletic Union, said of Tucker: “Believe me, he&#x27;s better than Leon Spinks. Spinks couldn&#x27;t hold this kid&#x27;s gloves at a comparable stage.” Rollie Schwartz, past national chairman of the AAU Boxing Commission, said of Tucker prior to the Olympics, &quot;Tucker is a combination boxer and puncher, much akin to Joe Louis. He comes right at you. I&#x27;d take him tomorrow over the two so-called light Heavyweight champs.&quot;

===1980 Olympics===
Since 1979 Tony Tucker anticipated participating in the Moscow Olympics. Tucker was an alternate for the United States Olympic Team for the 1980 Summer Olympics (Lee Roy Murphy qualified as the prime.) President Jimmy Carter ordered to boycott the Olympics, which led the U.S. Team to cancel its participation in the Olympics, instead it embarked on a series of exhibitions in Europe. On March 14, 1980, en route to Poland, their plane Polish Airlines IL-62 crashed near Warsaw, with the U.S. boxing team aboard, consisting of 22 boxers, there were no survivors. Several people, including Tony Tucker, missed the flight and stayed in the United States due to various reasons, in Tucker&#x27;s case an injury sustained just prior to the accident. At that point Tucker became religious, believing that God spared his life for a purpose, in order for him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Shortly thereafter Tucker turned pro.

Tucker finished his amateur career having 121 fights under his belt, with a record of 115–6.

==Professional career==
After turning pro in 1980, Tucker&#x27;s early fights were often shown on NBC, as part of a collection known as &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Champions&quot;.

Tucker&#x27;s progress in the professional ranks was slow. He was injury-prone, missing more than a year with a knee injury suffered in a bout against Danny Sutton. Tucker also changed managers and trainers several times; his father, Bob Tucker, eventually performed both roles. After enjoying a high profile upon his professional debut, Tucker boxed in non-televised bouts for the majority of the 1980s.

In June 1984, he scored a win by knocking out Eddie &quot;The Animal&quot; Lopez in nine rounds on the undercard of the Tommy Hearns–Roberto Durán fight. It was the first time Lopez had ever been knocked down. Tucker followed it up in September by outpointing Jimmy Young .

In September 1986, Tucker finally landed a big fight, against 242 lb James &quot;Broad-Axe&quot; Broad, for the USBA belt and a world title eliminator. Tucker won by unanimous decision.

===IBF heavyweight champion===

==== Tucker vs Douglas ====
Home Box Office and Don King Productions orchestrated a heavyweight unification series for 1987, planning among its bouts a match between Tucker and reigning IBF champion Michael Spinks. Spinks refused to face Tucker, opting instead for a more lucrative bout with Gerry Cooney. The IBF stripped Spinks of the championship on February 19, mandating that Tucker (as its #1-ranked contender) face its number-two contender, Buster Douglas, the very man who would eventually dethrone Tyson. As the co-feature of reining unified champion Mike Tyson and ex-champ Pinklon Thomas, Tucker won the bout and the vacant IBF crown via tenth-round technical knockout.

==== Tucker vs. Tyson ====

Tucker, as the winner of the IBF title, was obliged to immediately defend his title in a unification bout with WBA and WBC champion Mike Tyson 64 days after winning the title, in what would be the tournament final, where Tucker was a 10-to-1 underdog. Before Tucker was managed by Emmanuel Steward, who received a negotiated percent of each payday. By that time for that same purpose a joint venture named Tucker Inc. was formed by his promoters Cedric Kushner (18% of total share), and Josephine Abercrombie with Jeff Levine (also 18%), partnering with Dennis Rappaport and Alan Kornberg (13%,) and lastly Emmanuel Steward (6%). His father Bob Tucker also secured a share in Tucker Inc. (12%)

Before the fight versus Tyson, Tucker had been on an eight-year-long winning streak, his last defeat was in 1979, while competing in amateurs.

Despite having a broken right hand, Tucker faced Tyson on August 1, 1987. Tyson defeated Tucker by unanimous decision to unify the three championship titles, leaving Tucker with the shortest world championship reign in the history of the heavyweight division (64 days). According to the HBO Punch Statistics, Tucker landed 174 of 452 punches thrown, while Tyson landed 216 of 412, and in fact outjabbed Tucker, who had more than a 10-inch reach advantage (81&quot; to 71&quot;).

HBO host and boxing great Sugar Ray Leonard said: &quot;What Tucker displayed tonight was the fact that he is a non-conformist. He did what a lot of us thought he couldn&#x27;t do, and that&#x27;s why I respect him so much, because he boxed, he clinched, he was very strategic, very tactical, very intelligent fighter.&quot;

Coincidentally, this exact scenario would unfold again eight years later to give Tucker another title shot.

===Comeback===
Tucker returned to boxing in 1989 and was back in Don King&#x27;s stable by 1992. He won the NABF belt with a 12-round split decision over highly-ranked Orlin Norris and successfully defended it against future world champion Oliver McCall, winning another 12-round split decision. He finished 1992 with a sixth-round TKO of Frankie Swindell and set himself up for another world title shot.

Tucker had run his record up to 48–1 and challenged Lennox Lewis for the WBC world heavyweight title in May 1993. Lewis won a 12-round unanimous decision, knocking the challenger down twice in the process. The 34-year-old Tucker had never been off his feet in his pro career until this bout.
After beating Michael Moorer in November 1994 to become the oldest world heavyweight champion in history, George Foreman began negotiations in early 1995 to make the first defense of his WBA and IBF titles against German mid-level prospect Axel Schulz. As Schulz was not ranked by either organization, Foreman could not defend their championships against Schulz without their permission.

The IBF granted Foreman permission to face Schulz, which Foreman ultimately did. However, the WBA refused, insisting that Foreman instead face Tucker, their organization&#x27;s #1-ranked contender.

The situation in which Tucker had found himself in 1987 now played out again: the WBA vacated the title due to Foreman&#x27;s non-compliance, setting up an April 1995 title bout between Tucker and number-two contender Bruce Seldon. Seldon won by TKO after seven rounds when doctors stopped the fight due to Tucker&#x27;s eye closing shut.

Tucker lost his chance at a rematch later that year when he lost a ten-round decision to a newly-signed Don King heavyweight, British-Nigerian boxer Henry Akinwande.

In 1996 he was outpointed by old rival Orlin Norris. He scored two low-key wins in California, and in 1997 traveled to the U.K. to challenge Herbie Hide for the vacant WBO title. Tucker was dropped three times en route to a second-round knockout.

In 1998 Tucker challenged John Ruiz for his NABF belt. Despite a big sixth round in which he had Ruiz in trouble, Tucker was eventually stopped in the 11th round.

He came back in May to knock out journeyman Billy Wright in one round, but later had his license revoked due to medical concerns about Tucker&#x27;s vision.

<text>The Chippewa Cree Tribe (Officially in ) is a Native American tribe on the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation in Montana who are descendants of Cree who migrated south from Canada and Chippewa (Ojibwe) who moved west from the Turtle Mountains in North Dakota in the late 19th century. The two different peoples spoke related but distinct Algonquian languages. They are federally recognized as the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation.

This tribe is the southernmost Cree tribe in North America.

Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation is located in Hill and Chouteau counties in northeastern Montana, about from the Canada–United States border. It has a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The population was 3,323 at the 2010 census. The Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x27; Labor Force Report of 2005 reported 5,656 enrolled members of the tribe.

==History==
The Chief Asiniiwin (Chippewa) (English translation Stone Child, misnomer Rocky Boy, which conveys an incorrect meaning) and Chief Little Bear (Cree) and their bands were the founders of the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation in north-central Montana. At the time, Chippewa-Cree lived throughout present-day Montana, on the Blackfeet and other reservations, as well as in the new towns developed by European-American settlers and immigrants. In January 1902 &quot;Asiniiwin&quot; petitioned President Theodore Roosevelt for a closed reservation so the landless Chippewa-Cree could settle and get an education. The members were counted in a 1909 census conducted by Thralls B. Wheat, a land allotment agent of the Department of the Interior. This census was certified by the agency in April 1909.

Reflecting the social turmoil of the time, many of Asiniiwin&#x27;s people left the reservation within a decade; others had never relocated there, and their descendants live in towns throughout the Pacific Northwest. For instance, many bought plots of land on Hill 57, outside Great Falls, Montana. Congress passed legislation on September 7, 1916, () creating the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation. Those Chippewa-Cree living near Great Falls were not counted as members in the 1917 census of the reservation but were part of the tribe.

In May 1917, the Interior Department compiled another list of residents on the reservation. By then additional Native Americans had migrated there and others had left. Fewer than 45 of the 451 names listed on the &quot;Tentative Roll of the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation&quot; (1917) were Chippewa from the earlier 1909 roll. Many were Cree, descendants of Little Bear&#x27;s (Imasees) band, and Métis, descendants of the Louis Riel band of mixed-race peoples from the Red River of the North area. According to tribal traditions of absorbing war captives and protecting all children of tribal women, if residents identified as Cree or Chippewa, they were listed as Native American, regardless of whether they had other ancestry. The 1917 roll was approved by the Department of the Interior in July 1917; it has since been the basis for tribal membership rolls and allotments.

The Cree and Métis migrants and their descendants have lived on the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Reservation under self-declared &quot;adopted&quot; status. They and their descendants provided for such &quot;adopted&quot; status in the Chippewa Cree Tribal Constitution, which was written in 1934–1935. It was certified by the Department of the Interior in 1935 under the Indian Reorganization Act. . The constitution provided that members of the tribe who were absent from the reservation for 10 years or more (a ten-year absentee provision) lost their tribal status and were no longer qualified for benefits and membership.

The Chippewa Cree Business Committee, the government of the tribe, recently repealed this provision of the Constitution. As the tribe&#x27;s government, the Committee retains the authority to address membership issues. The Cree and Métis make up more than 90% of the enrolled members of the tribe.

==Language==
The principal language of the tribe is Cree, written in Eastern Cree syllabics. There are programs and courses dedicated to the preservation and teaching of the Cree language to the younger generation. There are also efforts to use revenue from sale of Official Tribal vehicle license plate would be used for installation of Cree signage in the community as well as investment in other language revitalization programs.

The status of the Chippewa (Ojibwe) language in the tribe is dire, as there is only one known living speaker of the language after the death of Duncan Standing Rock Sr. in February 2021. Standing Rock was an integral part of efforts to record and document the language.
==Economy==
As part of its economic development, the tribe started a business &quot;Plain Green Loans,&quot; for online lending to Native Americans who are underserved by the lack of banks on many reservations. &quot;The Tribal Independent&quot; reporter Delvin Cree (Turtle Mountain Chippewa), wrote in an opinion piece in 2012 that the tribe&#x27;s practices of high-interest, short-term lending are generally classified as predatory lending. These loans can result in annualized interest rates as high as 360 to 400 percent. In 2022, the company that had paid the tribe to use its tribal sovereignty to claim exemption from state laws paid $44 million to settle a lawsuit for illegal lending practices.

<text>The Ridolfi plot was a Catholic plot in 1571 to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. The plot was hatched and planned by Roberto Ridolfi, an international banker who was able to travel between Brussels, Rome and Madrid to gather support without attracting too much suspicion.

==Background==
Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, a Roman Catholic with a Protestant education, a second cousin of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s and the wealthiest landowner in the country, had been proposed as a possible husband for Mary since her imprisonment in 1568. This suited Norfolk, who had ambitions and felt Elizabeth persistently undervalued him. In pursuit of his goals, he agreed to support the Northern Rebellion, though he quickly lost his nerve. Norfolk was imprisoned in the Tower of London for nine months and only freed under house arrest when he confessed all and begged for mercy. Pope Pius V, in his 1570 papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, excommunicated the Protestant Elizabeth and permitted all faithful Catholics to do all they could to depose her. The majority of English Catholics ignored the bull, but in response to it, Elizabeth became much harsher to Catholics and their sympathisers.

==Plot==
Roberto Ridolfi, a Florentine banker and ardent Roman Catholic, had been involved in the planning of the Northern rebellion and had been plotting to overthrow Elizabeth as early as 1569. With the failure of the rebellion, he concluded that foreign intervention was needed to restore Catholicism and bring Mary to the English throne, and so he began to contact potential conspirators. Mary&#x27;s advisor, John Lesley, the Bishop of Ross, gave his assent to the plot as the way to free Mary. The plan was to have the Duke of Alba invade from the Netherlands with 10,000 men, foment a rebellion of the northern English nobility, murder Elizabeth, and marry Mary to Thomas Howard. Ridolfi optimistically estimated half of all English peers were Catholic and could muster in excess of 39,000 men. Norfolk verbally assured Ridolfi that he was a Catholic, guaranteeing that was true even though the Duke had been raised as a Protestant as a child. Both Mary and Norfolk, desperate to remedy their respective situations, agreed to the plot. With their blessing, Ridolfi set off to the Continent to gain Alba, Pius V, and King Philip II&#x27;s support.

===List of co-conspirators===
Ridolfi&#x27;s co-conspirators, some of them mentioned above, played an important role in the plot to overthrow Elizabeth:

Don Guerau de Espés: Spain&#x27;s ambassador to England, who was expelled after the discovery of his involvement. Elizabeth had raised her concerns about de Espés&#x27; behaviour with Anna of Austria.

John Lesley: the Bishop of Ross, who was Mary Stuart&#x27;s chief agent; arranged meetings and delivered letters for Mary during her house arrest.

Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who was Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s second cousin. He was to marry Mary Queen of Scots and together with her restore Catholic rule to the English and Scottish thrones. After the plot was discovered he was given a day-long trial that ended with his execution.

Mary, Queen of Scots: after it became clear that Elizabeth I was not going to restore her to the Scottish throne or return her to France, Mary plotted for her freedom. She wrote to Ridolfi denouncing the French and soliciting Spanish aid, while simultaneously professing friendship and loyalty to Elizabeth I and England. Giving her consent to the plot in March 1571, her role was to marry the Duke of Norfolk, with the plan that when the troops arrived in London she would be returned to the Scottish throne. However, when the plot was uncovered, her deep involvement in it altered Elizabeth&#x27;s opinion of Mary; Elizabeth never spoke of restoring her to the throne again.

King Philip II, who welcomed Ridolfi to court and, with the council, discussed the plot&#x27;s pros and cons. He supported overthrowing Elizabeth and later came to support the assassination. Philip, however, disapproved of the papal bull against Elizabeth because, according to Cyril Hamshere, he feared it would &quot;prompt Elizabeth to take reprisals against Catholics.&quot;

Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, who was the leader of the Spanish army stationed in the Netherlands and was to lead more than 10,000 men to Harwich or Portsmouth. His army was to invade England and make its way to London to establish Mary on the throne.

Pope Pius V, who made Ridolfi his papal agent in England in 1567, was not only aware of the plot but gave his written approval in a letter for Ridolfi to take to Philip II.

===Discovery===
In 1571, Elizabeth&#x27;s intelligence network was sending her information about a plot against her life. By gaining the confidence of Spain&#x27;s ambassador to England, John Hawkins learned the details of the conspiracy and notified the government so as to arrest the plotters. Elizabeth was also sent a private warning by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had learned of the plot against her. Charles Baillie, Ridolfi&#x27;s messenger, was arrested on c.12 April 1571 at Dover for carrying compromising letters, and by the use of torture and prison informers such as William Herle, he was forced to reveal the cipher of the messages he carried.

On 29 August 1571, Norfolk&#x27;s secretaries William Barker and Robert Higford entrusted to Thomas Browne, a Shrewsbury draper, what was purported to be a bag of silver coin for delivery to Laurence Bannister, one of Norfolk&#x27;s officials in the north of England. Browne grew suspicious of the bag&#x27;s weight, opened it, and discovered 600 pounds in gold from the French ambassador, destined for Scotland on Mary&#x27;s behalf, and ciphered letters. Because he knew Norfolk was under suspicion, Browne reported his find to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, the Secretary of State. Higford and Barker were interrogated, the letters were partly deciphered, and a search for the cipher key at Howard House uncovered a ciphered letter from Mary Stuart hidden under a doormat.

Norfolk&#x27;s servants were arrested and interrogated, and confessions were extracted from them by threats or application of torture. Sir Thomas Smith and Thomas Wilson were sent to confront Norfolk, who claimed the money was for his own private purposes. The deciphered letter, however, proved that he was lying. Unaware of his servants&#x27; confessions or the survival of letters which, contrary to his instructions, had not been burnt, he denied the charges against him. On 7 September, the queen&#x27;s warrant for conveying him to the Tower of London arrived. Thereupon, the duke admitted a degree of involvement in the transmission of money and correspondence to Mary&#x27;s Scottish supporters. In January 1572, Norfolk was tried and convicted on three counts of high treason, and on 2 June he was beheaded on Tower Hill.

Guerau de Spes, the Spanish ambassador, was expelled from the country in January 1571. Still abroad when the plot was discovered, Ridolfi never returned to England; he became a Florentine senator in 1600.

===Ridolfi&#x27;s role===
Despite his plot&#x27;s ultimate failure, Roberto Ridolfi&#x27;s story is surprising and memorable. He had played the relatively minor role of banker but nevertheless found himself at the centre of a major plot to overthrow the English government. Ridolfi had been jailed in 1568 because of a rumour that he had distributed money to dissenting nobles associated with the Northern Rebellion. The Pope did, in fact, give him 12,000 crowns for that purpose, but Ridolfi was released in 1570 because no evidence could be found to incriminate him. Even after his arrest and release, Ridolfi remained a spy for the Pope.
Ridolfi&#x27;s banking connections helped him become acquainted with the Duke of Norfolk, and he became a supporter of a marriage between Norfolk and Mary, Queen of Scots, who would, if the plot succeeded, rule England and reinstate Catholicism there.

After Norfolk&#x27;s release from prison in August 1570, Ridolfi &quot;picked up the broken threads of Catholic intrigue&quot;. Ridolfi was in an advantageous position to orchestrate a Catholic rebellion in England, since he was employed by the Pope, France, and Spain, and had ties to the Catholic contingent in England. He could use banking as an excuse to travel among these groups for the purpose of conspiring. When he travelled to mainland Europe to inform King Phillip and the Pope of the plot, it is believed that he was still working for Elizabeth.

===Plot failure===
The Duke of Alba, the Spanish Viceroy in the Netherlands who was to lead the attack on England, felt Ridolfi was too garrulous to be the leader of a conspiracy, but Spanish Ambassador Don Guerau de Spes described Ridolfi as &quot;A person of great truth and virtue and an intimate friend of mine.&quot; Ridolfi&#x27;s talkative nature did eventually cause him trouble, as he was not very discreet and trumpeted his plan all over Europe. His boasting was partially responsible for the plot failure, as he told it to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany who immediately informed Elizabeth of the plot.

==Aftermath==
Ridolfi escaped execution, unlike some of his co-conspirators, and lived until 1612.

===Modern criticism===
According to historian Cyril Hamshere, retrospective critics of the conspiracy cited a number of reasons why the Ridolfi Plot would have been doomed to fail even if it had not been discovered prematurely. For one, the small number of Spanish soldiers (between 6000 and 10,000) would have been absurdly inadequate to the task of overthrowing the English government. Additionally, the vagueness of the invasion point was a logistical shortcoming. The plan was to land at either Harwich or Portsmouth, but Ridolfi apparently did not know exactly where Harwich was. Also dubious was Ridolfi&#x27;s reliance on the Duke of Norfolk, who was regarded as a bad leader and was not even a Catholic. This did not make him an ideal co-conspirator, but, according to Hamshere, &quot;his main merit lay in his title: in 1571 he was the only Duke in England&quot;.

Norfolk&#x27;s Protestantism was but one irony of the Ridolfi Plot: Norfolk and Mary Queen of Scots had each been married three times before their proposed marriage to each other. Pope Pius was, apparently, willing to grant Mary an annulment of her marriage to her imprisoned husband, but the notion of two thrice wed royals leading England back to Catholicism is somewhat problematic, nonetheless.

==Media representations==
The Ridolfi Plot was covered in &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), starring Vanessa Redgrave as Mary and Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth.

An altered and fictionalised version of the Ridolfi Plot was featured in the film &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), starring Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth.

<doc id="219097" wikidata="Q2738219" url="?curid=219097" title="Street Fighting Man">
<text>&quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, written by the songwriting team of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Considered one of the band&#x27;s most popular and most controversial songs, it features Indian instrumentation contributed by Brian Jones, which has led to it being characterized as a raga rock song. It also features controversial and ambiguous lyrics about armed revolution. In the United States, it was released as a single in August 1968, while it was not released in the United Kingdom until four months later on the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; album, where it opened side two. The B-side of the American single featured &quot;No Expectations&quot;, considered one of the final Stones tracks in which founding member Jones played a significant role in its construction. And it was the final Rolling Stones single on which Jones performed.

While &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was originally written with an entirely different set of lyrics, growing violence at political events throughout 1968 inspired Mick Jagger to alter the song to directly address such topics. With its release coming after a highly politically charged and publicized summer of violence, and the release of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolution&quot;, a song with similar themes, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; sparked controversy in the United States upon release, with many radio stations boycotting the song and refusing to play it. As a result of this, the song peaked only at number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, after the previous Stones single &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; reached the top three in America. &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; thus became the lowest-charting Rolling Stones A-side since their American single debut &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, four years prior.

Despite the initial poor chart reception and controversy, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was praised by the music press upon its release, and played a role in elevating the Rolling Stones&#x27; reputation as a culturally subversive group. Retrospectively, the song has been praised for its lyrics and production, and is viewed by some commentators as one of the greatest and most important songs of the 1960s. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the song number 295 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, while &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it the 62nd best song of the 1960s.

==Background==
Throughout 1965 and 1966, the Stones moved further from their traditional blues-based sound and experimented more and more with Indian timbres in their music, with prominent examples of this trend in their work including &quot;Mother&#x27;s Little Helper&quot; and &quot;Paint It Black&quot; Additionally, Brian Jones, the original leader of the Rolling Stones, became an important creative force within the band due to his contributions on multiple instruments during the sessions for &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Between the Buttons&quot;, and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; became one of the final songs recorded by the Stones for which Brian Jones played a major role in the final arrangement, alongside its B-side &quot;No Expectations&quot;, for which he contributed an acclaimed slide guitar part. It was their final A-side to feature him and last to be released before his death.

While the final version of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; featured Indian musical elements like earlier Stones songs, the song&#x27;s creation did not result from these influences. In an interview with Marc Myers, Keith Richards said that he wrote most of the music for the song in late 1966 or early 1967 on the acoustic guitar, and got the &quot;dry, crisp&quot; sound that he wanted by strumming a guitar with an open tuning in front of a portable Philips cassette recorder microphone, leading to notable distortion in the sound. According to Richards, the melody was influenced by the sound of police sirens, despite the song not having acquired its final, politically conscious lyrics at this stage of its evolution.

== Development ==
Following the composition of the music for the song, a set of lyrics were written that differed significantly from the final song. Originally the song was entitled &quot;Did Everyone Pay Their Dues?&quot;, and featured a set of lyrics about adult brutality, The finalized version of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; is known as one of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards&#x27; most politically inclined works. Jagger allegedly wrote a new set of lyrics to the song about Tariq Ali after he attended a 1968 anti-war rally at London&#x27;s US embassy, during which mounted police attempted to control a crowd of 25,000. He also found inspiration in the rising violence among student rioters on Paris&#x27; Left Bank, the precursor to a period of civil unrest in May 1968.

Jagger explained how the inspiration for &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; came from movements outside of his native United Kingdom in a 1995 interview with Jann Wenner in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:

Richards said, only a few years after recording the track in a 1971 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with Robert Greenfield, that the song had been &quot;interpreted thousands of different ways&quot;. He mentioned how Jagger went to the Grosvenor Square demonstrations in London and was even charged by the police, yet on the topic of the song&#x27;s meaning, he ultimately claims, &quot;it really is ambiguous as a song&quot;.

==Recording==
Recording on &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; took place at Olympic Sound Studios from April until May 1968, as part of the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; sessions. Jimmy Miller, the Rolling Stones&#x27; producer during this period described guitarist Keith Richards as &quot;a real workhorse&quot; while recording the album, mostly due to the infrequent presence of Brian Jones. When he did show up at the sessions, Jones behaved erratically due to his drug use and emotional problems. Miller said that Jones would &quot;show up occasionally when he was in the mood to play, and he could never really be relied on:

Even given this, Jones contributes to every track on &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; except the final two, playing sitar and tanpura on &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;. Other personnel on the song include Jagger on vocals, Richards plays the song&#x27;s acoustic guitar parts as well as the bass guitar, the only electric instrument featured on the recording. Charlie Watts plays drums while Nicky Hopkins performs the song&#x27;s piano which is largely buried in the mix, but is most distinctly heard during the coda. Shehnai is performed on the track by Dave Mason. On the earlier, unreleased &quot;Did Everybody Pay Their Dues&quot; version, Rick Grech played a very prominent electric viola.

Watts said in 2003:
Richards commented on the recording:

==Releases==
Released as &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;″s lead single in August 1968 in the US, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was popular on release, but did not reach the Top 40 (reaching number 48) of the US charts in response to many radio stations&#x27; refusal to play the song based on what were perceived as subversive lyrics. &quot;No Expectations&quot;, also from &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, was used as the single&#x27;s B-side. As usual with Stones&#x27; album tracks in the 60s, the single did not see a release at the time in the UK. It was released in 1971 backed with &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot;, the closing track from the Stones&#x27; American-only album &quot;The Rolling Stones, Now&quot;, previously released in the UK only on the various artists Decca LP compilation &quot;14&quot; in 1965.

The US single version was released in mono with an additional vocal overdub on the choruses, and thus is different from the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; album&#x27;s stereo version. While many of the US London picture sleeves are rare and collectable, the sleeve for this single is particularly scarce and is considered their most valuable.

The album version of the song has been included on the compilations &quot;Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)&quot; (1969), &quot;Hot Rocks 1964-1971&quot; (1971), &quot;30 Greatest Hits&quot; (1977), &quot;Singles Collection: The London Years&quot; (1989 edition), &quot;Forty Licks&quot; (2002), and &quot;GRRR!&quot; (2012). The US single version was included on the 2002 edition of &quot;Singles Collection: The London Years&quot; and on &quot;Stray Cats&quot;, a collection of singles and rarities released as part of the box set &quot;The Rolling Stones in Mono&quot; (2016).

A staple at Rolling Stones live shows since the band&#x27;s American Tour of 1969, concert recordings of the song have been captured and released for the live albums &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot; (recorded 1969, released 1970), &quot;Stripped&quot; (1995; rereleased on &quot;Totally Stripped&quot; in 2016), &quot;Live Licks&quot; (recorded 2003, released 2004), and &quot;Hyde Park Live&quot; (2013).

==Critical reception==
According to music journalist Anthony DeCurtis, the &quot;political correctness&quot; of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, particularly the lyrics &quot;What can a poor boy do/&#x27;Cept sing in a rock and roll band&quot;, sparked intense debate in the underground media. The song opens with a strummed acoustic guitar riff. In his review, Richie Unterberger says of the song, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s a great track, gripping the listener immediately with its sudden, springy guitar chords and thundering, offbeat drums. That unsettling, urgent guitar rhythm is the mainstay of the verses. Mick Jagger&#x27;s typically half-buried lyrics seem at casual listening like a call to revolution.&quot;

Unterberger continues, &quot;Perhaps they were saying they wished they could be on the front lines, but were not in the right place at the right time; perhaps they were saying, as John Lennon did in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolution&quot;, that they didn&#x27;t want to be involved in violent confrontation. Or perhaps they were even declaring indifference to the tumult.&quot;

Music journalist Greil Marcus, who was demonstrating in Berkeley during the weekend of the convention in Chicago, contrasted &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; to the contemporary Beatles b-side &quot;Revolution&quot;. In his words, &quot;[The Beatles] were ordering us to pack up and go home, but the Stones seemed to be saying that we were lucky if we had a fight to make and a place to take a stand.&quot; The far left contrasted &quot;Revolution&quot; with &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, Despite the ambiguity in Jagger&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was perceived to be supportive of a radical agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burley/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the contrasts drawn between the Beatles and Stones, French film director Jean-Luc Godard publicly attacked John Lennon and the Beatles for their apolitical stance, while praising the Stones. Lennon accused Godard of being insincere in his criticism, and alleged his true motivation for his attacks was the Beatles&#x27; choice to decline working with him on his film &quot;One Plus One,&quot; while the Stones agreed to participate&quot;.&quot;

In the years since the song&#x27;s release, writers&#x27; interpretations have varied widely. In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a &quot;great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as &#x27;Summer in the City&#x27;, &#x27;Summertime Blues&#x27;, and &#x27;Dancing in the Street&#x27;.&quot; In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that as part of &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was the &quot;keynote, with its teasing admonition to do something and its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers.&quot; In fact, the second line of the first verse alludes to &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;; a similar line had been present in the aforementioned song, where &quot;fighting&quot; instead was &quot;dancing&quot;.

==Backlash in the United States==
The song was released within a week of the violent confrontations between the police and anti-Vietnam War protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Worried about the possibility of the song inciting further violence, Chicago radio stations refused to play the song. This was much to the delight of Mick Jagger, who stated: &quot;I&#x27;m rather pleased to hear they have banned (the song). The last time they banned one of our records in America, it sold a million.&quot; Jagger said he was told they thought the record was subversive, to which he snapped: &quot;Of course it&#x27;s subversive! It&#x27;s stupid to think you can start a revolution with a record. I wish you could.&quot; Despite Jagger&#x27;s statements, the ban and general aversion to the song among radio programmers was likely a factor in its commercial underperformance relative to other Stones singles.

Keith Richards weighed into the debate when he said that the fact a couple of radio stations in Chicago banned the record &quot;just goes to show how paranoid they are&quot;. At the same time they were still requested to do live appearances and Richards said: &quot;If you really want us to cause trouble, we could do a few stage appearances. We are more subversive when we go on stage.&quot;

==Retrospective views==
Since its inclusion on the Stones&#x27; album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; has been traditionally seen as a highlight of the album. Colin Larkin, in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2006), wrote that &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was &quot;a return to strength&quot; which included &quot;the socio-political &#x27;Street Fighting Man&#x27;.

Bruce Springsteen would comment in 1985, after including &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; in the encores of some of his Born in the U.S.A. Tour shows: &quot;That one line, &#x27;What can a poor boy do but sing in a rock and roll band?&#x27; is one of the greatest rock and roll lines of all time... [The song] has that edge-of-the-cliff thing when you hit it. And it&#x27;s funny; it&#x27;s got humour to it.&quot;

When asked about the songs relevance in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine thirty years following its release, Mick Jagger said &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it [has any]. I don&#x27;t know whether we should really play it. I was persuaded to put it [on Voodoo Lounge Tour] because it seemed to fit in, but I&#x27;m not sure if it really has any resonance for the present day. I don&#x27;t really like it that much.&quot; Despite this, the song has been performed on a majority of the Stones&#x27; tours since its introduction to their canon of work, and is usually played second to last before their usual closing track &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;.

<doc id="219101" wikidata="Q1477141" url="?curid=219101" title="Jumpin' Jack Flash">
<text>&quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released as a non-album single in 1968. Called &quot;supernatural Delta blues by way of Swinging London&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the song was seen as the band&#x27;s return to their blues roots after the baroque pop and psychedelia heard on their preceding albums &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966) (which did feature some blues songs), &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; (1967) and especially &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; (1967). One of the group&#x27;s most popular and recognisable songs, it has been featured in films and covered by numerous performers, notably Thelma Houston, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Peter Frampton, Johnny Winter, Leon Russell and Alex Chilton. To date, it is the band&#x27;s most-performed song; they have played it over 1,100 times in concert.

One of the band’s most popular songs, it was ranked number 144 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list in 2021.

==Inspiration and recording==
Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, recording on &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; began during the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; sessions of 1968. Regarding the song&#x27;s distinctive sound, guitarist Richards has said:

Richards has stated that he and Jagger wrote the lyrics while staying at Richards&#x27; country house, when they were awoken one morning by the clumping footsteps of his gardener Jack Dyer walking past the window. Surprised, Jagger asked what it was, and Richards responded: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Jack – that&#x27;s jumpin&#x27; Jack.&quot; The lyrics evolved from there. Humanities scholar Camille Paglia speculated that the song&#x27;s lyrics might have been partly inspired by William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Mental Traveller&quot;: &quot;She binds iron thorns around his head / And pierces both his hands and feet / And cuts his heart out of his side / To make it feel both cold &amp; heat.&quot; The main riff is similar to their song &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. 

Jagger said in a 1995 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the song arose &quot;out of all the acid of &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot;. It&#x27;s about having a hard time and getting out. Just a metaphor for getting out of all the acid things.&quot; And in a 1968 interview, Brian Jones described it as &quot;getting back to ... the funky, essential essence&quot; following the psychedelia of &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Stone Alone&quot;, Bill Wyman has said that he came up with the song&#x27;s distinctive main guitar riff, working on it with Brian Jones and Charlie Watts before it was ultimately credited to Jagger and Richards. In &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot;, Wyman credits Jagger with vocals, Richards with guitar and bass guitar, Jones with guitar, Watts with drums and himself with organ on the track with producer Jimmy Miller adding backing vocals.

According to the book &quot;Keith Richards: The Biography&quot; by Victor Bockris, the line &quot;I was born in a crossfire hurricane&quot;, was written by Richards, and refers to his being born amid the bombing and air raid sirens of Dartford, England, in 1943 during World War II.

Two promotional videos were made that May: one of a live performance and another of the band lip syncing in makeup.

==Release and aftermath==
Released on 24 May 1968 in the UK by Decca Records and on 31 May in the US by London Records, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (backed with &quot;Child of the Moon&quot;) was the band&#x27;s first UK release in five and a half months – this marked the group&#x27;s longest gap between releases in the country up to that point. A major commercial success, it reached the top of the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three in the United States. It topped the US &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart for one week and the WLS 890 Hit Parade for four weeks. Some early London Records US pressings and Decca single in the UK of the single had a technical flaw in them: at about 2:10 about halfway through the song&#x27;s instrumental bridge, the speed of the master tape slows down for a moment, before coming back to speed. The first Rolling Stones album on which the song appeared was their 1969 compilation album, &quot;Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)&quot;, one year after the single was released. Since then, it has appeared on numerous other Stones compilations, including &quot;Hot Rocks 1964–1971&quot; (1971), &quot;Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones&quot; (1975), &quot;Singles Collection: The London Years&quot; (1989), &quot;Forty Licks&quot; (2002), &quot;GRRR!&quot; (2012), and &quot;Stray Cats&quot;, a collection of singles and rarities included as part of &quot;The Rolling Stones in Mono&quot; box set (2016).

The Rolling Stones have played &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; during every tour since its release. It is the song the band have played in concert most frequently, and has appeared on the concert albums &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out!&quot; (recorded 1969, released 1970), &quot;Love You Live&quot; (recorded 1976, released 1977), &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (recorded 1990, released 1991), &quot;Shine a Light&quot; (recorded 2006, released 2008), &quot;Hyde Park Live&quot; (2013), &quot;Totally Stripped&quot; (recorded 1995, released 2016), and &quot;Havana Moon&quot; (2016), as well as, notably, &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; (recorded 1968, released 1996), featuring the only released live performance of the song with Brian Jones. Unlike most of that show, Jones is heard clearly, mixing with Richards&#x27;s lead throughout the song. The intro is not usually played in concert and instead the song begins with the main riff. The open E or open D tuning of the rhythm guitar on the studio recording has also not been replicated in concert (with the possible exception of the 1968 NME awards show, no recording of which has ever surfaced). In the performance filmed for &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; in December 1968, Richards used standard tuning; and ever since the band&#x27;s appearance at Hyde Park on 5 July 1969, he has played it in open G tuning with a capo on the fourth fret. Richards is particularly fond of the song&#x27;s main riff, often crediting it as his favorite among all of his most revered guitar riffs.

In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; at number 2 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. VH1 placed it at number 65 in its show &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot;.

It has placed at 144 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and 7th on their list of the band&#x27;s best songs.

A cover version of the song, performed by Billy Fogarty, was composed to serve as the final mission of the Nintendo DS rhythm game &quot;Elite Beat Agents&quot;, in which the titular protagonists use their dancing skills to rally humanity against alien invaders who plan to outlaw all forms of music.

The opening line &quot;I was born in a crossfire hurricane&quot; contributed the name of the FBI&#x27;s 2016 Crossfire Hurricane investigation into links between Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign and Russia.

<text>Bdelloidea (from Greek βδέλλα, &quot;bdella&quot; &#x27;leech&#x27;) is a class of rotifers found in freshwater habitats all over the world. There are over 450 described species of bdelloid rotifers (or &#x27;bdelloids&#x27;), distinguished from each other mainly on the basis of morphology. The main characteristics that distinguish bdelloids from related groups of rotifers are exclusively parthenogenetic reproduction and the ability to survive in dry, harsh environments by entering a state of desiccation-induced dormancy (anhydrobiosis) at any life stage. They are often referred to as &quot;ancient asexuals&quot; due to their unique asexual history that spans back to over 25 million years ago through fossil evidence. Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic organisms, typically between 150 and 700 μm in length. Most are slightly too small to be seen with the naked eye, but appear as tiny white dots through even a weak hand lens, especially in bright light. In June 2021, biologists reported the restoration of bdelloid rotifers after being frozen for 24,000 years in the Siberian permafrost.

==Evolutionary relationships==
The phylum Rotifera traditionally included three classes: Bdelloidea, Monogononta and Seisonidea. Prior to 1990, phylogenetic studies based on morphology seemed to indicate that the sister group to bdelloid rotifers was Monogononta, with seisonid rotifers as an early-diverging outgroup.

Modern molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrate that this classic understanding of &#x27;Rotifera&#x27; is incomplete (paraphyletic), because it omits a fourth clade of closely related organisms: the Acanthocephala, or thorny-headed worms. Originally classified as a separate phylum, molecular and morphological evidence accumulated between 1994 and 2014 to indicate that Acanthocephala forms a monophyletic group with Bdelloidea, Monogononta and Seisonidea. To accommodate this finding, some authors extend the term &#x27;Rotifera&#x27; to include the highly modified, parasitic &#x27;acanthocephalan rotifers&#x27; alongside bdelloid, monogonont and seisonid rotifers. Others refer to the grouping of the four taxa as Syndermata, a term derived from their shared syncytial epidermis.

The position of Bdelloidea within Syndermata (or Rotifera) is not entirely clear. Alternative possible phylogenetic relationships within the clade are illustrated by the accompanying cladograms. As of 2014, the &quot;most comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of syndermatan relationships&quot; to date was based on transcriptome data from all four groups, and provided &quot;strong support&quot; for the hypothesis illustrated in the bottom left of the figure, in which Seisonidea and Acanthocephala are sister taxa. The study further indicated that the sister group to this taxon is Bdelloidea, whereas Monogononta is the outgroup to all three. This would mean that the closest living relatives of bdelloid rotifers are not monogonont rotifers, as previously believed, but seisonid rotifers and acanthocephalans, despite their highly modified morphology.

==Classification and identification==
Bdelloidea is a class of the phylum Rotifera, consisting of three orders: Philodinavida, Philodinida and Adinetida. These orders are divided into four families and about 450 species. Since these organisms are asexual the usual definition of a species as a group of organisms capable of creating fertile offspring is inapplicable, therefore the species concept in these organisms is based on a mixture of morphological and molecular data instead. DNA studies suggest that the diversity is much greater than the original morphological classifications suggest.

Bdelloids can only be identified by eye while they are alive because many of the characteristics significant to classification are related to feeding and crawling; however, genetic identification of bdelloids is possible on dead individuals. Once preserved, the individuals contract into &quot;blobs&quot; which restricts analysis. There are currently three morphological identification methodologies, two of which are considered dated: Bartoš (1951) and Donner (1965). The third method is a diagnostic key developed in 1995 by Shiel.

===Morphology===

There are three main regions of the body of bdelloids: head, trunk and foot. The adjacent image depicts each area to show how body parts can be very different although they are named the same depending on the species involved. Bdelloids typically have a well-developed corona, divided into two parts, on a retractable head.

Some identifiable features of the bdelloids include :
*Well-developed foot glands
*A mouth opening with a long oesophagus
*Strong teeth (labelled by a tooth index)
*Many cilia
*Species-specific upper lip shape
*Order-specific corona type
**Philodinida consist of two ciliated discs
**Adinetida consist of a ventral ciliated field
**Philodinavida have a small corona

The bdelloid digestive and reproductive systems can be found within the trunk sections of their bodies, with the stomach being the most visible of the organs. In certain genera, (&quot;Habrotrocha&quot;, &quot;Otostephanos&quot; and &quot;Scepanotrocha&quot;) the bdelloid can actually be identified by the appearance of distinct spherical pellets within the stomach, which will be released as faeces. These pellets are a distinguishing characteristic since all the other genera release faeces as loose material.

Most bdelloids retract the foot while they eat, but there are four genera that lack a foot: &quot;Adineta&quot;, &quot;Bradyscela&quot;, &quot;Henoceros&quot; and &quot;Philodinavus&quot;. This affects not only how they feed but also how they crawl; for instance &quot;Adineta&quot; and &quot;Bradyscela&quot; slide whereas the other genera loop.

==Behaviour==

The behaviour of bdelloids can be split into four categories: feeding, locomotion, reproduction and stress-induced behaviours.

===Feeding===
The specific feeding behaviour of bdelloids is varied but most use rings of cilia in the corona organ to create currents of water which blow food through the mouth to the mastax organ which has been adapted specifically for grinding food. Food includes suspended bacteria, algae, detritus, and other things.

===Locomotion===
There appear to be three main methods of movement: free swimming, inch-worming along a substrate, or sessility. Inch-worming (or crawling) involves taking alternate steps with the head and tail, as do certain leeches, which gives the group their name (Greek &quot;βδέλλα&quot; or &quot;bdella&quot;, meaning leech).

===Reproduction===
Bdelloids are of interest in the study of the evolution of sex because a male has never been observed, and females reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction where embryos grow and develop without the need for fertilization; this is akin to the apomixis seen in some plants. Each individual has paired gonads. Despite having been asexual for millions of years, they have diversified into more than 450 species and are fairly similar to other sexually reproducing rotifer species.

However, a new study provided evidence for interindividual genetic exchange and recombination in &quot;Adineta vaga&quot;, a species previously thought to be anciently asexual.

&quot;Adineta vaga&quot; is capable of carrying out DNA repair by a nonreductional meiosis. Germline DNA repair occurs in a specific period of oogenesis during which homologous chromosomes take on a meiotic-like juxtaposed configuration. This germline DNA repair results in accurate reconstitution of the genetic material transmitted to offspring.

=== Evolution of obligate parthenogenetic reproduction ===
In 2003, the mode of asexual reproduction in the bdelloid rotifers was wholly unknown. One theory of how obligate parthenogenesis arose in bdelloid rotifers was that parthenogenic lineages lost the ability to respond to sex-inducing signal, which is why these lineages retained their asexuality. The obligate parthenogenetic strains of bdelloid rotifers produce a sex-inducing signal but have lost the ability to respond to that signal. It was later discovered that the inability to respond to sex-inducing signals in obligate parthenogens was caused by simple Mendelian inheritance of the gene &quot;op.&quot; 

===Stress-induced behaviour===

Bdelloids are able to survive environmental stresses by entering a state of dormancy known as anhydrobiosis which enables the organism to rapidly dehydrate and thus resist desiccation. While preparing for this dormant state many metabolic processes are adjusted to equate for the change in state; e.g. the production of protective chemicals. The bdelloid can remain in this state, which is known as a &#x27;xerosome&#x27; until the return of a sufficient amount of water, at which point they will rehydrate and become active within hours. Hatching of the young will only occur when conditions are at their most favourable. These forms of dormancy are also known as cryptobiosis or quiescence. Bdelloids have been known to survive in this state for up to 9 years while waiting for favourable conditions to return. In addition to surviving desiccation through anhydrobiosis, desiccation stress on two bdelloid species actually helped to maintain fitness and even improved their species fecundity. The rotifers that were consistently kept hydrated fared worse than those desiccated and rehydrated.

Bdelloidea have evolved a unique mechanism to help overcome one of the major perils of asexual reproduction. According to the Red Queen hypothesis of co-evolution, obligate asexuals will be driven extinct by rapidly changing parasites and pathogens, because they cannot change their genotypes quickly enough to keep up in this never-ending race. In populations of bdelloid rotifers, however, many parasites are destroyed during periods of extended desiccation. Moreover, desiccated bdelloid rotifers are easily blown away from parasite-infested habitats by wind, and establish new, healthy populations elsewhere, which allows them to escape the Red Queen by moving in time and space instead of using sex to change their genotype.

When these creatures recover from desiccation, it has been shown that they undergo a potentially unique genetic process where horizontal gene transfer occurs, resulting in a significant proportion of the bdelloid genome, up to 10%, having been obtained through horizontal gene transfer from bacteria, fungi and plants. How and why horizontal gene transfer occur in bdelloids is under much debate at present; particularly with regards to possible connections between the foreign genes and the desiccation process as well as possible connections to bdelloids&#x27; ancient asexuality.

When they desiccate completely, their DNA breaks up into many pieces. And when they come back to life after being rehydrated, it creates an opportunity for alien DNA fragments to enter their genome. This process was improved 60 million years ago when they captured a bacterial gene this way, which gave them a new gene regulatory system. The new system was used to keep transposons in check.

Bdelloid rotifers are extraordinarily resistant to damage from ionizing radiation due to the same DNA-preserving adaptations used to survive dormancy. These adaptations include an extremely efficient mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. This repair mechanism was studied in two Bdelloidea species, &quot;Adineta vaga&quot;, and &quot;Philodina roseola&quot;. and appears to involve mitotic recombination between homologous DNA regions within each species.

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
Large-scale horizontal transfer of bacterial, plant and fungal genes into bdelloid rotifers has been documented, and may represent an important factor in bdelloid evolution.

<text>Pančevo (Serbian Cyrillic: Панчево, ; ; ; ; ) is a city and the administrative center of the South Banat District in the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. It is located on the shores of rivers Tamiš and Danube, in the southern part of Banat region. Since the 2022 census 115,454 people have been living in the Pančevo administrative area. Pančevo is the third largest city in Vojvodina and the seventh largest in Serbia by population.

Pančevo was first mentioned in 1153 and was described as an important mercantile place. It gained the status of a city in 1873 following the disestablishment of the Military Frontier in that region. For most of its period, it was the part of the Kingdom of Hungary and after 1920 it became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed in 1929 to Yugoslavia. Since then with one interruption it was part of several Yugoslav states and after the dissolution of the latest in 2003, it is part of its successor state, Serbia. Pančevo is notable for being multi-ethnic, Serbs (and Germans until 1945) have been the dominant ethnic group since the 16th century and since 2011 they compose 80% of the total population of the city.

Pančevo is a city with rich cultural events and monuments, and in the past, it also used to be a filming location for many national and international movie productions. Since 2003 an international and multi-cultural carnival has been organized in the city. It is also the main economic center of the South Banat region and its economy is also mostly tied up to Belgrade&#x27;s economy. HIP factory is located in Pančevo as well as UTVA which was heavily damaged during the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. Pančevo is also well known for its brewery and silk factory which were founded in the early 18th century, and as well as the light bulb factory which are all now defunct. Pančevo is also home to many historical objects, museums and parks.

==Name==
In Serbian and Macedonian, the town is known as &quot;Pančevo&quot; (Панчево), in Hungarian as &quot;Pancsova&quot;, in Slovak as &quot;Pánčevo&quot;, in Romanian as &quot;Panciova&quot; and in German as &quot;Pantschowa&quot;. The place name is probably derived from an old Slavonic term and meant location of marsh.

==Geography==
Pančevo is located on flat plains at , approximately 17 km NE of Pančevo bridge to Belgrade and 43 km NW of Smederevo. The altitude above sea level is 77 meters. The southern city quarters are located on the bank of the Danube, the western quarters to the bank of Tamiš. The Danube river islands Forkontumac and Čakljanac are southernmost part of urban area.

===Climate===
Pančevo has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;).

=== Flora and fauna ===

==== Birds ====
Nature reserves near the city, the coastal areas of the rivers Tamiš and Danube, as well as numerous islands, are a habitat for over 100 species of birds, 63 species of which are natural rarities.

The City Forest with over 300 hectares, and the National Garden, the largest city park with almost 15 hectares, are located just a few minutes walk from the center of Pančevo and are home to many species of birds.

A particularly important bird habitat, in addition to the Ponjavica Nature Park and the Ivanovačka Ada Special Nature Reserve, is the Deliblato Sands Special Nature Reserve, which is partly located in Pančevo.

The notable bird species found in Pančevo are the white-tailed eagle, black storks, bullfinch and black-winged stilt. The first lowland feeding ground in Serbia for the white-tailed eagle, which is on the list of endangered species, was built on the territory of Pančevo.

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th century many archaeological artifacts of the Stone Age period were found, remains of settlements and places of burial from the times of Bronze Age (Urnfield culture) and Ancient Rome on the urban area. Most of the objects are exhibited at the National Museum of the town.

In 1154, Arabic Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi described region in his &quot;Book of Pleasant Journeys into Faraway Lands&quot; as an important mercantile place. The regional area was administered by the Bulgarian Empire until early 11th century, then by the Kingdom of Hungary until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1521. During Turkish rule, the region was part of the Temeşvar Eyalet and mostly populated by Serbs. In 1660, Evliya Çelebi described the town as a quadrangular fortification being diameter of one hundred Turkish feet. During the Austro-Turkish War, the fortification was conquered by Imperial troops under supreme command of Claude Florimond de Mercy in 1716. There is an impression of the old city and its fortification recorded on maps from 1717 and 1720 which are located at National Széchényi Library and Institute of Military History in Budapest.

After the Treaty of Požarevac, the urban area belonged to the Habsburg Banat, and temporarily served as garrison of the Habsburg Imperial Army. In December 1764, a military commission of Viennese Hofkriegsrat registered all people and number of more or less habitable houses, and the Habsburg government encouraged massive immigration of German settlers for administrative furnishing and developing new district of Military Frontier. In January 1794, Francis II signed the charter of borough rights of Pančevo, there is no other real evidence like a deed of city founding. In 1852, the fortification was slighted for urban expanding. In 1873, the military frontier was abolished and Pančevo included into the Torontál county of Austria-Hungary. In 1902, cadastral maps of the town were recorded which are located at the National Archives of Hungary.
After the Austrian-Hungarian Armistice of Villa Giusti, the region became part of the provisional Torontalsko-tamiške županja and due to the Treaty of Trianon finally belonged to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1922, the region was structured into the Belgrade oblast and since 1929 into the Dunavska banovina.

===Effects of World War II on City life===

In April 1941, Pančevo was occupied during the invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany. On 21-22 April, 1941, Wehrmacht soldiers committed a war crime massacre in the city when 36 Serbian people were murdered by hanging and shooting as a reprisal for the deaths of 9 Volksdeutsche members of the paramilitary formation Mannschaft, a part of the SS Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, and a wounded comrade of that division, attacked by three men of the Royal Yugoslavian Army before the state surrender. On April 11, 1941, Royal Cavalry officers Stevan Rikanović, Saša Rakezić and Milan Orlić gave a signal during the German parade that they did not accept the looming Yugoslavian defeat. They erected temporary scaffolding behind a wall of a Catholic cemetery and fired at the Nazi Mannschaft, who, after overcoming that surprise, returned fire immediately, assisted by two SS men who had been seated in a nearby German café. On April 6, 1941, members of the Mannschaft had already daubed anti-semitic slogans on some graves in this cemetery; some gravestones were badly damaged, too, but they put on the grave of Georg Weifert a wreath with a decorated swastika ribbon. The following day, pro-German groups marched through all the streets, smashed windows of Serbian shops and taunted, spat and beat Serbian civilians because &quot;they had to stay in their homes and were not allowed to go out.&quot; On April 17, 1941, there was a power demonstration with a deployment of Mannschaft units in front of City Hall Square, and an incendiary speech by Kreisführer Otto Vogenberger from the balcony of the building, in which he spoke about the &quot;liberation of regional Germans from Yugoslav slavery&quot; and announced &quot;three days of celebrations until the birthday of our Führer.&quot; On April 20, 1941, the Kreisführer was personally gifted with a portrait of Hitler by Heinrich Knirr, who was &quot;visiting his beloved homeland&quot;. On May 1, 1941, selected policemen from the Banatian State Guard were publicly sworn in at the same place with black uniforms and a Totenkopf on their collar, speaking words such as &quot;protecting the rights and lives of German people,&quot; although they had already been recruited in April. Propaganda photos and film of the reprisal massacre were used decades after the event to help chronicle the Wehrmacht&#x27;s complicity in the atrocities during the war, often manipulated in German-language TV documentaries.
During World War II in Yugoslavia, Pančevo was part of Autonomous Banat within German-occupied Serbia. Selected Danube Swabian men were recruited and conscripted in Mannschaft, in Waffen-SS, the majority of them either in SS-Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, in German Police or &quot;SS&quot; Freiwilligen Gebirgsjäger Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. More than 99.99 percent of local German women and youth were organized in formations such as the Deutsche Frauenschaft and the Deutsche Jugend (including the DMB) and dedicated to Nazism. In 1943, the Südostdeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft issued a very treacherously worded census with the note &quot;for official use only,&quot; stating that &quot;there are amazingly fifty eight &#x27;orthodox Germans&#x27; in it,&quot; which is a phrase used to describe collaborators of Romanian origin. In 1944, after the defeat of the German Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS during the Belgrade Offensive by the Allied Armies, a part of the German population left the city, together with the defeated German army. In November 1944, in cooperation with the OZNA, a KNOJ brigade was set up to denazify the region, consisting of 20 elite partisans who volunteered to execute symbolic deterrent measures under the supreme command of Brigade Commander Svetozar Rupić. All measures began for the first time in January 1945 after intensive research and determination of the execution sites. The rest of the ethnic German population remained in the country. These people were sent to local internment camps which existed until 1948. After their dissolution, much of the ethnic German population left Yugoslavia for economic reasons. From 1945, the city belonged to the Srez Pančevo of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The city was the administrative center of the region from all these centuries to the present.

The city district Vojlovica was added to the town in 1978.

Since its inception, probably the most famous of all honorable choirmasters is Davorin Jenko, who conducted the choir from 1863 to 1865. In the present, the choir is conducted for the fourth time in a continuous sequence by a woman. The most important Cultural Center of the city (Kulturni Centar Pančeva) is located in the former theater building of the city, founded in 1947 and named National Theater which realized play productions in cooperation with National Theater Novi Sad. In 1956, the political authorities of the town decided the creation of a cultural center which is representing variety of all Arts. The center has a gallery of Modern art, and it promotes continuous festivals like Biennial of Art (Bijenale umetnosti), the music festival &quot;Ethno.com&quot; and the &quot;Pančevački Jazz Festival&quot; with artists from all over the world. In addition, some theater productions are shown annually in cooperation with National Theater Belgrade and other famous institutions. In 2012, the center published all popular stories of Zigomar Comics in a collected edition. Since 1977, the House of Youth (Dom omladine) is venue of the event &quot;Rukopisi&quot; (Manuscripts) where young writers are presented each year. The facility also promotes many other events like &quot;FreeDOM Art Festival&quot;. There is also the continuous Film festival &quot;PAFF&quot; worth mentioning which has a good reputation beyond the region. In the past, the city has been filming location for many national and international movie productions, including well known movies such as La Tour, prends garde!, The Mongols, I Even Met Happy Gypsies, Balkan Express, Black Cat, White Cat and Coriolanus.

The National Museum was founded in 1923 and it is located in former neoclassical city hall since several decades. The institution has a valuable permanent exhibition and it is one of the most important museums of Vojvodina. The Vajfert Brewery is located in the town&#x27;s center and it is the oldest one of today&#x27;s Serbia, founded in 1722 by Abraham Kepiš from Bratislava. The brewery was run by the Vajfert family for several generations and its most famous represent was Đorđe Vajfert. After closing in 2008 and a conflagration in 2010, the building complex was a ruin in recent years. In 2015, the city began to realize a concept for revitalizing the industrial heritage and in the following year, the Đorđe Vajfert Brewery Museum was opened in the presence of the Austrian and German ambassadors. In the same year, a new summer festival called &quot;Vajfert Days&quot; was held for the first time. The intention of the organizer is to promote the tourist, cultural, artistic and economic potential of the city.

<text>Monogononta is a class of rotifers, found mostly in freshwater but also in soil and marine environments. They include both free-swimming and sessile forms. Monogononts generally have a reduced corona, and each individual has a single gonad, which gives the group its name. Males are generally smaller than females, and are produced only during certain times of the year, with females otherwise reproducing through parthenogenesis.

Their is not designed for grinding. They produce mictic and amictic eggs. The class contains 1,570 species.

<text>Seisonidae is a family of rotifers, found on the gills of &quot;Nebalia&quot;, a marine crustacean. Peculiar among rotifers, males and females are both present and equal in size. Males and females are similar with paired gonads. It is considered to have diverged from the other rotifers early on, and in one treatment is placed in a separate class Seisonoidea. They have a large and elongate body with reduced corona. Their muscular system is similar to that of other rotifers: they have longitudinal muscles as well as open annular muscles. Being attached for most of their life, they are semi-sessile, but are capable of detaching and crawl short distances if required.

Feeding has never been observed directly, but the stomach in &quot;Seison nebaliae&quot; contained bacteria, while a substance that probably represents hemolymph of the &quot;Nebalia&quot; host was found in the stomach of &quot;Paraseison annulatus&quot;. The latter prefer to settle beneath the carapace on the gills of the host&#x27;s legs, and the former is usually found on the host&#x27;s carapase, trunk or legs. Their host often lives in tidal puddles with decomposing algae for a limited period of time, with oxygen content so low it sometimes reaches anoxia, which doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the Seisonidae.

== Species ==
Two genera with total four species belong to Seisonidae:

* &quot;Paraseison&quot; 
** &quot;Paraseison annulatus&quot; — ectoparasite of &quot;Nebalia&quot;
** &quot;Paraseison kisfaludyi&quot;
* &quot;Seison&quot; 
** &quot;Seison nebaliae&quot; – commensal of &quot;Nebalia&quot;
** &quot;Seison africanus&quot; — host is unknown.

<text>Seabiscuit (May 23, 1933 – May 17, 1947) was a champion thoroughbred racehorse in the United States who became the top money-winning racehorse up to the 1940s. He beat the 1937 Triple Crown winner, War Admiral, by four lengths in a two-horse special at Pimlico and was voted American Horse of the Year for 1938.

A small horse, at 15.2 hands high, Seabiscuit had an inauspicious start to his racing career, winning only a quarter of his first 40 races, but became an unlikely champion and a symbol of hope to many Americans during the Great Depression.

Seabiscuit has been the subject of numerous books and films, including &quot;Seabiscuit: the Lost Documentary&quot; (1939); the Shirley Temple film &quot;The Story of Seabiscuit&quot; (1949); a book, &quot;&quot; (1999) by Laura Hillenbrand; and a film adaptation of Hillenbrand&#x27;s book, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. There is also a street in Indian Trail, North Carolina named after him.

==Early days==

Seabiscuit was foaled in Lexington, Kentucky, on May 23, 1933, from the mare Swing On and sire Hard Tack, a son of Man o&#x27; War. Seabiscuit was named for his father; &quot;sea biscuit&quot; is another name for hardtack, a type of cracker eaten by sailors.

The bay colt grew up on Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, where he was trained. He was undersized, knobby-kneed, and given to sleeping and eating for long periods.

Initially, Seabiscuit was owned by the powerful Wheatley Stable and trained by &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Fitzsimmons, who had taken Gallant Fox to the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Fitzsimmons saw some potential in Seabiscuit but felt the horse was too lazy. Fitzsimmons devoted most of his time to training Omaha, who won the 1935 Triple Crown.

Seabiscuit was relegated to a heavy schedule of smaller races. He failed to win any of his first 17 races, usually finishing back in the field. After that, Fitzsimmons did not spend much time on him, and the horse was sometimes the butt of stable jokes. However, Seabiscuit began to gain attention after winning two races at Narragansett Park and setting a new track record in the second—Claiming Stakes race.

As a two-year-old, Seabiscuit raced 35 times (a heavy racing schedule), coming in first five times and finishing second seven times. These included three claiming races, in which he could have been purchased for $2,500, but he had no takers.

While Seabiscuit had not lived up to his racing potential, he was not the poor performer Fitzsimmons had taken him for. His last two wins as a two-year-old came in minor stakes races. The next season started with a similar pattern. The colt ran 12 times in less than four months, winning four times. One of those races was a cheap allowance race on the &quot;sweltering afternoon of June 29,&quot; 1936, at Suffolk Downs. That was where trainer Tom Smith first laid eyes on Seabiscuit. His owners sold the horse to automobile entrepreneur Charles S. Howard for $8,000 at Saratoga, in August.

==1936/1937: The beginning of success ==

Howard assigned Seabiscuit to a new trainer, Tom Smith, who, with his unorthodox training methods, gradually brought Seabiscuit out of his lethargy. Smith paired the horse with Canadian jockey Red Pollard (1909–1981), who had experience racing in the West and in Mexico. On August 22, 1936, they raced Seabiscuit for the first time. Improvements came quickly, and in their remaining eight races in the East, Seabiscuit and Pollard won several times, including the Detroit Governor&#x27;s Handicap (worth $5,600) and the Scarsdale Handicap ($7,300) at Empire City Race Track in Yonkers, New York.

In early November 1936, Howard and Smith shipped the horse to California by rail. His last two races of the year were at Bay Meadows racetrack in San Mateo, California. The first was the $2,700 Bay Bridge Handicap, run over . Despite starting badly and carrying the top weight of , Seabiscuit won by five lengths. At the World&#x27;s Fair Handicap (Bay Meadows&#x27; most prestigious stakes race), Seabiscuit led throughout.

In 1937, the Santa Anita Handicap, California&#x27;s most prestigious race, was worth over $125,000 ($ million in 2010) to the winner; it was known colloquially as &quot;The Hundred Grander.&quot; In his first warm-up race at Santa Anita Park, Seabiscuit won easily. In his second race of 1937, the San Antonio Handicap, he suffered a setback after he was bumped at the start and then pushed wide; Seabiscuit came in fifth, losing to Rosemont.

The two met again in the Santa Anita Handicap a week later, where Rosemont won by a nose. The defeat was devastating to Smith and Howard and was widely attributed in the press to a jockey error. Pollard, who had not seen Rosemont over his shoulder until too late, was blind in one eye due to an accident during a training ride, a fact he had hidden throughout his career. A week after this defeat Seabiscuit won the San Juan Capistrano Handicap by seven lengths in track record time of 1:48 for the mile event.

Seabiscuit was rapidly becoming a favorite among California racing fans, and his fame spread as he won his next three races. With his successes, Howard decided to ship the horse east for its more prestigious racing circuit.

Seabiscuit&#x27;s run of victories continued. Between June 26 and August 7, he ran five times, each time in a stakes race, and each time he won under steadily increasing handicap weights (imposts) of up to . For the third time, Seabiscuit faced off against Rosemont again, this time beating him by seven lengths. On September 11, Smith accepted an impost of for the Narragansett Special at Narragansett Park. On race day, the ground was slow and heavy, and unsuited to &quot;the Biscuit&quot;, carrying the heaviest burden of his career. Smith wanted to scratch, but Howard overruled him. Never in the running, Seabiscuit finished third. His winning streak was snapped, but the season was not over; Seabiscuit won his next three races (one a dead heat) before finishing the year with a second-place at Pimlico.

In 1937, Seabiscuit won 11 of his 15 races and was the year&#x27;s leading money winner in the United States. However, War Admiral, having won the Triple Crown that season, was voted the most prestigious honor, the American Horse of the Year Award.

==Early five-year-old season==

In 1938, as a five-year-old, Seabiscuit&#x27;s success continued. On February 19, Pollard suffered a terrible fall while racing on Fair Knightess, another of Howard&#x27;s horses. With half of Pollard&#x27;s chest caved in by the weight of the fallen horse, Howard had to find a new jockey. After trying three, he settled on George Woolf, an already successful rider and old friend of Pollard&#x27;s.

Woolf&#x27;s first race aboard Seabiscuit was the Santa Anita Handicap, &quot;The Hundred Grander&quot; the horse had narrowly lost the previous year. Seabiscuit was drawn on the outside, and at the start was impeded by another horse, Count Atlas, angling out. The two were locked together for the first straight, and by the time Woolf disentangled his horse, they were six lengths off the pace. Seabiscuit worked his way to the lead but lost in a photo finish to the fast-closing Santa Anita Derby winner, Stagehand (owned by Maxwell Howard, not related to Charles), who had been assigned less than Seabiscuit.

Throughout 1937 and 1938, the media speculated about a match race between Seabiscuit and the seemingly invincible War Admiral (sired by Man o&#x27; War, Seabiscuit&#x27;s grandsire). The two horses were scheduled to meet in three stakes races, but one or the other was scratched, usually due to Seabiscuit&#x27;s dislike of heavy ground. After extensive negotiation, the owners organized a match race for May 1938 at Belmont, but Seabiscuit was scratched.

By June, Pollard had recovered, and on June 23, he agreed to work a young colt named Modern Youth. Spooked by something on the track, the horse broke rapidly through the stables and threw Pollard, shattering his leg and seemingly ending his career.

Howard arranged a match race for Seabiscuit against Ligaroti, a highly regarded horse owned by the Hollywood entertainer Bing Crosby and Howard&#x27;s son, Lindsay, through Binglin Stable, in an event organized to promote Crosby&#x27;s resort and Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. With Woolf aboard, Seabiscuit won that race, despite persistent fouling from Ligaroti&#x27;s jockey. After three more outings and with only one win, he was scheduled to go head-to-head with War Admiral in the Pimlico Special in November, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Sent to race on the East Coast, on October 16, 1938, Seabiscuit ran second by two lengths in the Laurel Stakes to the filly Jacola, who set a new Laurel Park Racecourse record of 1:37.00 for one mile.

On November 1, 1938, Seabiscuit met War Admiral and jockey Charles Kurtsinger in what was dubbed the &quot;Match of the Century.&quot; The event was run over at Pimlico Race Course. From the grandstands to the infield, the track was jammed with fans. Trains were run from all over the country to bring fans to the race, and the estimated 40,000 at the track were joined by 40 million listening on the radio. War Admiral was the favorite (1–4 with most bookmakers) and a nearly unanimous selection of the writers and tipsters, excluding a California contingent.

Head-to-head races favor fast starters, and War Admiral&#x27;s speed from the gate was well known. Seabiscuit, on the other hand, was a pace stalker, skilled at holding with the pack before pulling ahead with late acceleration. From the scheduled walk-up start, few gave him a chance to lead War Admiral into the first turn. Smith knew these things and trained Seabiscuit to run against this type, using a starting bell and a whip to give the horse a Pavlovian burst of speed from the start.

When the bell rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed over to the rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, gradually pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two hundred yards from the wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral&#x27;s running his best time for the distance.

As a result of his races that year, Seabiscuit was named American Horse of the Year for 1938, beating War Admiral by 698 points to 489 in a poll conducted by the &quot;Turf and Sport Digest magazine&quot;. Seabiscuit was the number one newsmaker of 1938. The only major prize that eluded him was the Santa Anita Handicap.

==Injury and return==
Seabiscuit was injured during a race. Woolf, who was riding him, said that he felt the horse stumble. The injury was not life-threatening, although many predicted Seabiscuit would never race again. The diagnosis was a ruptured suspensory ligament in the front left leg. With Seabiscuit out of action, Smith and Howard concentrated on their horse Kayak II, an Argentine stallion. In the spring of 1939, Seabiscuit covered seven of Howard&#x27;s mares, all of which had healthy foals in spring of 1940. One, Fair Knightess&#x27;s colt, died as a yearling.

Seabiscuit and a still-convalescing Pollard recovered together at Howard&#x27;s ranch, with the help of Pollard&#x27;s new wife Agnes, who had nursed him through his initial recovery. Slowly, both horse and rider learned to walk again (Pollard joked that they &quot;had four good legs between&quot; them). Poverty and his injury had brought Pollard to the edge of alcoholism. A local doctor broke and reset Pollard&#x27;s leg to aid his recovery, and slowly Pollard regained the confidence to sit on a horse. Wearing a brace to stiffen his atrophied leg, he began to ride Seabiscuit again, first at a walk and later at a trot and canter. Howard was delighted at their improvement, as he longed for Seabiscuit to race again, but was extremely worried about Pollard, as his leg was still fragile.

Over the fall and winter of 1939, Seabiscuit&#x27;s fitness seemed to improve by the day. By the end of the year, Smith was ready to return the horse to race training, with a collection of stable jockeys in the saddle. By the time of his comeback race, Pollard had cajoled Howard into allowing him the ride. After the horse was scratched due to soft going, the pair finally lined up at the start of the La Jolla Handicap at Santa Anita, on February 9, 1940. Seabiscuit was third, beaten by two lengths. By their third comeback race, Seabiscuit was back to his winning ways, running away from the field in the San Antonio Handicap to beat his erstwhile training partner, Kayak II, by two and a half lengths. Under , Seabiscuit equalled the track record for a mile and 1/16.

One race was left in the season. A week after the San Antonio, Seabiscuit and Kayak II both took the gate for the Santa Anita Handicap and its $121,000 prize. 78,000 paying spectators crammed the racetrack, most backing Seabiscuit. Pollard found his horse blocked almost from the start. Picking his way through the field, Seabiscuit briefly led. As they thundered down the back straight, Seabiscuit became trapped in third place, behind leader Whichcee and Wedding Call on the outside.

Trusting in his horse&#x27;s acceleration, Pollard steered between the leaders and burst into the lead, taking the firm ground just off the rail. As Seabiscuit showed his old surge, Wedding Call and Whichcee faltered, and Pollard drove his horse on, taking &quot;The Hundred Grander&quot; by a length and a half from the fast-closing Kayak II under jockey Leon Haas. Pandemonium engulfed the course. Neither horse and rider, nor trainer and owner, could get through the crowd of well-wishers to the winner&#x27;s enclosure for some time.

==Retirement, later life, and offspring==
On April 10, 1940, Seabiscuit&#x27;s retirement from racing was officially announced. When he was retired to the Ridgewood Ranch near Willits, California, he was horse racing&#x27;s all-time leading money winner. Put out to stud, Seabiscuit sired 108 foals, including two moderately successful racehorses: Sea Sovereign and Sea Swallow. Over 50,000 visitors went to Ridgewood Ranch to see Seabiscuit in those seven years before his death in 1947.

==Death and interment==
Seabiscuit died of a probable heart attack on May 17, 1947, in Willits, California, six months before his grandsire Man o&#x27; War. He is buried at Ridgewood Ranch in Mendocino County, California.

<text>The Roman emperor was the ruler and monarchical head of state of the Roman Empire, starting with the granting of the title to Octavian in 27 BC. The term &quot;emperor&quot; is a modern convention, and did not exist as such during the Empire. When a given Roman is described as becoming &quot;emperor&quot; in English, it generally reflects his accession as , and later as . Another title used was , originally a military honorific, and , originally a cognomen. Early emperors also used the title (&quot;first one&quot;) alongside other Republican titles, notably and .

The legitimacy of an emperor&#x27;s rule depended on his control of the Roman army and recognition by the Senate; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, or by the Senate, or both. The first emperors reigned alone; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors to secure the succession or to divide the administration of the empire between them. The office of emperor was thought to be distinct from that of a (&quot;king&quot;). Augustus, the first emperor, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch. For the first three hundred years of Roman emperors, efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of the Republic, fearing any association with the kings who ruled Rome prior to the Republic.

From Diocletian, whose reformed tetrarchy divided the position into one emperor in the West and one in the East, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style. Although succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy, so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted, which often led to several claimants to the throne. Despite this, elements of the republican institutional framework (Senate, consuls, and magistrates) were preserved even after the end of the Western Empire.

Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, moved the capital from Rome to Constantinople, formerly known as Byzantium, in 330 AD. Roman emperors had always held high religious offices; under Constantine there arose the specifically Christian idea that the emperor was God&#x27;s chosen ruler on earth, a special protector and leader of the Christian Church, a position later termed Caesaropapism. In practice, an emperor&#x27;s authority on Church matters was frequently subject to challenge. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century after multiple invasions by Germanic barbarian tribes, with no recognised claimant to Emperor of the West remaining after the death of Julius Nepos in 480. Instead, the Eastern emperor Zeno proclaimed himself as the sole emperor of a theoretically undivided Roman Empire (although in practice he had no authority in the West). The subsequent Eastern emperors ruling from Constantinople styled themselves as &quot; of the Romans&quot; (, ) but are often referred to in modern scholarship as Byzantine emperors.

The papacy and Germanic kingdoms of the West acknowledged the Eastern emperors until the accession of Empress Irene in 797. After this, the papacy created a rival lineage of Roman emperors in western Europe, the Holy Roman Emperors, which ruled the Holy Roman Empire for most of the period between 800 and 1806. These emperors were never recognized in Constantinople and their coronations resulted in the medieval problem of two emperors. The last Eastern emperor was Constantine XI Palaiologos, who died during the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. After conquering the city, Ottoman sultans adopted the title &quot; of the Romans&quot; (). A Byzantine group of claimant emperors existed in the Empire of Trebizond until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1461, although they had used a modified title since 1282.

== Background and beginning ==

Modern historians conventionally regard Augustus as the first emperor, whereas Julius Caesar is considered the last dictator of the Roman Republic, a view that is shared by the Roman writers Plutarch, Tacitus, and Cassius Dio. Conversely, the majority of Roman writers, including Pliny the Younger, Suetonius and Appian, as well as most of the ordinary people of the Empire, thought of Julius Caesar as the first emperor. Caesar did indeed rule the Roman state as an autocrat, but he failed to create a stable system to maintain himself in power. His rise to power was the result of a long and gradual decline in which the Republic fell under the influence of powerful generals such as Gaius Marius and Sulla.

At the end of the Republic no new, and certainly no single, title indicated the individual who held supreme power. Insofar as &quot;emperor&quot; could be seen as the English translation of the Latin , then Julius Caesar had been an emperor, like several Roman generals before him. Instead, by the end of the Caesar&#x27;s civil wars, it became clear that there was certainly no consensus to return to the old-style monarchy, but that the period when several officials would fight one another had come to an end.

Julius Caesar, and then Augustus after him, accumulated offices and titles of the highest importance in the Republic, making the power attached to those offices permanent, and preventing anyone with similar aspirations from accumulating or maintaining power for themselves. Julius Caesar had been &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; since 64 BC; held the offices of consul and dictator five times since 59 BC, and was appointed dictator in perpetuity in 44 BC, shortly before his assassination. He had also become the &quot;de facto&quot; sole ruler of Rome in 48 BC, when he defeated his last opposition at the Battle of Pharsalus. His killers proclaimed themselves as the &quot;liberatores&quot; (&quot;liberators&quot;) and the restorers of the Republic, but their rule was cut short by Caesar&#x27;s supporters, who almost immediately established a new dictatorship.

In his will, Caesar appointed his grandnephew Octavian as his heir and adopted son. He inherited his property and lineage, the loyalty of most of his allies, and – again through a formal process of senatorial consent – an increasing number of the titles and offices that had accrued to Caesar. In August 43 BC, following the death of both consuls of the year, Octavian marched to Rome and forced the Senate to elect him consul. He then formed the Second Triumvirate alongside Mark Antony and Lepidus, dividing the Roman world among them. Lepidus was sidelined in 36 BC, and relations between Octavian and Antony soon deteriorated. In September 31 BC, Octavian&#x27;s victory at Actium put an end to any effective opposition and confirmed his supremacy over Rome.

In January 27 BC, Octavian and the Senate concluded the so-called &quot;First settlement&quot;. Until then Octavian had been ruling the state with his powers as &quot;triumvir&quot;, even though the Triumvirate itself disappeared years earlier. He announced that he would return the power to the Senate and People of Rome, but this was only an act. The Senate confirmed Octavian as &quot;princeps&quot;, the &quot;first among equals&quot;, and gave him control over almost all Roman provinces for a tenure of ten years. This limitation was only superficial, as he could renew his powers indefinitely. In addition, the Senate awarded him the appellation of &quot;augustus&quot; (&quot;elevated&quot;). The honorific itself held no legal meaning, but it denoted that Octavian (henceforth Augustus) now approached divinity, and its adoption by his successors made it the &quot;de facto&quot; main title of the emperor. He also received the civic crown alongside several other insignias in his honor. Augustus now held supreme and indisputable power, and even though he still received subsequent grants of powers, such as the granting of &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; in 23 BC, these were only ratifications of the powers he already possessed.

Most modern historians use 27 BC as the start date of the Roman Empire. This is mostly a symbolic date, as the Republic had essentially disappeared many years earlier. Ancient writers often ignore the legal implications of Augustus&#x27; reforms and simply write that he &quot;ruled&quot; Rome following the murder of Caesar, or that he &quot;ruled alone&quot; after the death of Mark Antony. Most Romans thus simply saw the &quot;emperor&quot; as the individual that ruled the state, with no specific title or office attached to him.

Augustus actively prepared his adopted son Tiberius to be his successor and pleaded his case to the Senate for inheritance on merit. After Augustus&#x27; death in AD 14, the Senate confirmed Tiberius as and proclaimed him as the new &quot;augustus&quot;. Tiberius had already received &quot;imperium maius&quot; and &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; in AD 4, becoming legally equal to Augustus but still subordinate to him in practice. The &quot;imperial office&quot; was thus not truly defined until the accession of Caligula, when all of Tiberius&#x27; powers were automatically transferred to him as a single, abstract position that was symbolized by his sacred title of &quot;augustus&quot;.

== Powers under the Principate ==
The legal authority of the emperor derived from an extraordinary concentration of individual powers and offices that were extant in the Republic and developed under Augustus and later rulers, rather than from a new political office. Under the Republic, these powers would have been split between several people, who would each exercise them with the assistance of a colleague and for a specific period of time. Augustus held them all at once by himself, and with no time limits; even those that nominally had time limits were automatically renewed whenever they lapsed. The Republican offices endured and emperors were regularly elected to the most prominent of them: the consulship and censorship. This early period of the Empire is known as the &quot;Principate&quot;, derived from the title &quot;princeps&quot; used by the early emperors.

The most important bases of the emperor&#x27;s power were his supreme power of command (&quot;imperium maius&quot;) and tribunician power (&quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;) as personal qualities, separate from his public office. Originally, the powers of command where divided in consular &quot;imperium&quot; for Rome and proconsular &quot;imperium&quot; for the provinces. This division became obsolete in 19 BC when Augustus was given consular &quot;imperium&quot; – despite leaving the consulship in 23 BC – and thus control over all troops. This overwhelming power was referred to as &quot;imperium maius&quot; to indicate its superiority to other holders of &quot;imperium&quot;, such as the proconsuls of the few senatorial provinces and allies such as Agrippa. The governors appointed to the imperial provinces only answered to the emperor himself, who could maintain or replace them at will.

The tribunician power (&quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;), first assumed by Augustus in 23 BC, gave him authority over the tribune of the plebs without having to actually hold the office – a tribune was by definition a plebeian, whereas Augustus, although born into a plebeian family, had become a patrician when he was adopted into the &quot;gens Julia&quot;. By adopting the role of a tribune, Augustus was presenting himself as the representative of the common man and the protector of democracy. As always, this was not a sudden grant of power; Augustus had been receiving several powers related to the tribunes, such as sacrosanctity, since 36 BC. With this powers, he could veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, propose laws and convoke the Senate. His sacrosanctity also made him untouchable, and any offence against him could be treated as a crime of treason. The tribunician power was arguably the most stable and important of the emperor&#x27;s powers. Despite being a perpetual title, it was always renewed each year, which often coincided with the beginning of a new regnal year (although &quot;regnal years&quot; were not officially adopted until Justinian I).

The office of censor was not fully absorbed into the imperial office until the reign of Domitian, who declared himself &quot;perpetual censor&quot; (&quot;censor perpetuus&quot;) in AD 85. Before this, the title had been only used by Claudius (47), Vespasian and Titus (both in 73).

The emperor also had power over religious affairs, which led to the creation of a worship cult. Augustus became &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; (the chief priest of the College of Pontiffs) in 12 BC, after the death of the former &quot;triumvir&quot; Lepidus. Emperors from the reign of Gratian (r. 375–383) onward used the style &quot;pontifex inclytus&quot; (&quot;honorable pontiff&quot;). The title of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was eventually adopted by the bishops of Rome during the Renaissance. The last known emperors to use the title were Valentinian III and Marcian, in the 5th century.

The only surviving document to directly refer to the emperor&#x27;s power is the &quot;Lex de imperio Vespasiani&quot;, written shortly after Vespasian&#x27;s formal accession in December 69. The text, of which only the second part survives, states that Vespasian is allowed to: make treaties; hold sessions and propose motions to the Senate; hold extraordinary sessions with legislative power; endorse candidates in elections; expand the &quot;pomerium&quot;; and use discretionary power whenever necessary. The text further states that he is &quot;not bound by laws&quot;, and that any previous act was retroactively considered legitimate. There is no mention of &quot;imperium&quot; nor &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;, although these powers were probably given in the earlier clauses. There is also no mention of any &quot;imperial office&quot;, and the title of &quot;emperor&quot; is never used. The imperial titles are treated as inseparable of the person, which is reflected in the name &quot;Imperator Caesar Vespasianus Augustus&quot;. This &quot;Lex&quot; sometimes related to the &quot;Lex regia&quot; (&quot;royal law&quot;) mentioned in the of Eastern emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), who cites the early 3rd-century writer Ulpian. This was probably a later construct, as its very name, which derives from &quot;rex&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), would have been utterly rejected in the West. The Eastern Greek-speaking half of the Empire had always regarded the emperors as open monarchs (&quot;basileis&quot;), and called them as such.

== Succession and legitimacy ==
The weakest point of the Augustan institution was its lack of a clear succession system. Formally announcing a successor would have revealed Augustus as a monarch, so he and subsequent emperors opted to adopt their best candidates as their sons and heirs. Primogeniture was not relevant in the early Empire, although emperors still attempted to maintain a familiar connection between them; Tiberius, for example, married Julia the Elder, making him Augustus&#x27; son-in-law.

Vespasian, who took power after the collapse of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the tumultuous Year of the Four Emperors, was the first emperor to openly declare his sons, Titus and Domitian, as his sole heirs, giving them the title of &quot;caesar&quot;. The Senate still exercised some power during this period, as evidenced by his decision to declare Nero a &quot;public enemy&quot;, and did influence in the succession of emperors. Following the murder of Domitian in AD 96, the Senate declared Nerva, one of their own, as the new emperor. His &quot;dynasty&quot;, the Antonine, continued the adoptive system until the reign of Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180). Marcus was the first emperor to rule alongside other emperors, first with his adoptive brother Lucius Verus, who succeeded jointly with him, and later with his son Commodus, who was proclaimed co-&quot;augustus&quot; in 177.

Despite being the son of a previous emperor and having nominally shared government with him, Commodus&#x27; rule ended with his murder at the hands of his own soldiers. From his death in 192 until the 5th century, there was scarcely a single decade without succession conflicts and civil war. During this period, very few emperors died of natural causes. Such problems persisted in the later Eastern Empire, where emperors had to often appoint co-emperors to secure the throne. Despite often working as a hereditary monarchy, there was no law or single principle of succession.
Individuals who claimed imperial power &quot;illegally&quot; are referred to as &quot;usurpers&quot; in modern scholarship. Ancient historians refer to these rival emperors as &quot;tyrants&quot;. In reality, there was no distinction between emperors and usurpers, as many emperors started as rebels and were retroactively recognized as legitimate. The &quot;Lex de imperio Vespasiani&quot; explicitly states that all of Vespasian&#x27;s actions are considered legal even if they happened before his recognition by the Senate. Ultimately, &quot;legitimacy was a &quot;post factum&quot; phenomenon.&quot; Theodor Mommsen famously argued that &quot;here has probably never been a regime in which the notion of legitimacy is as absent as that of the Augustan principate&quot;. Imperial propaganda was often used to legitimize or de-legitimize certain emperors. The &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, for example, describes Licinius as having been killed like &quot;those who had briefly been usurpers before him&quot;. In reality, Licinius was the legitimate emperor of the West (having been appointed by Galerius), while Constantine was the real &quot;usurper&quot; (having been proclaimed by his troops).

There were no true objective legal criteria for being acclaimed emperor beyond acceptance by the Roman army, which was really the true basis of imperial power. Common methods used by emperors to assert claims of legitimacy, such as support of the army, blood connections (sometimes fictitious) to past emperors, distributing one&#x27;s own coins or statues, and claims to pre-eminent virtue through propaganda, were pursued just as well by many usurpers as they were by legitimate emperors. Septimius Severus notably declared himself as the adoptive son of the long-deceased Marcus Aurelius, hence why he named Caracalla after him. Later Eastern imperial dynasties, such as the Doukai and Palaiologoi, claimed descent from Constantine the Great.

What turns a &quot;usurper&quot; into a &quot;legitimate&quot; emperor is typically that they managed to gain the recognition of a more senior, legitimate, emperor, or that they managed to defeat a more senior, legitimate emperor and seize power. Modern historiography has not yet defined clear legitimacy criteria for emperors, resulting in some emperors being included or excluded from different lists. The year 193 has traditionally been called the &quot;Year of the Five Emperors&quot;, but modern scholarship now identifies Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger as usurpers because they were not recognized by the Roman Senate. Recognition by the Senate is often used to determine the legitimacy of an emperor, but this criterion is not always followed. Maxentius is sometimes called an usurper because he did not have the recognition of Tetrarchs, but he held Rome for several years, and thus had the recognition of the Senate. Other &quot;usurpers&quot; controlled, if briefly, the city of Rome, such as Nepotianus and Priscus Attalus. In the East, the possession of Constantinople was the essential element of legitimacy, yet some figures such as Procopius are treated as usurpers. Rival emperors who later gained recognition are not always considered legitimate either; Vetranio had the formal recognition by Constantius II yet he is still often regarded as a usurper, similarly to Magnus Maximus, who was briefly recognized by Theodosius I. Western emperors such as Magnentius, Eugenius and Magnus Maximus are sometimes called usurpers, but Romulus Augustulus is traditionally regarded as the last Western emperor, despite never receiving the recognition of the Eastern emperor Zeno.

== Later developments ==
The period after the Principate is known as the Dominate, derived from the title &quot;dominus&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;) adopted by Diocletian. During his rule, the emperor became an absolute ruler and the regime became even more monarchical. The emperors adopted the diadem crown as their supreme symbol of power, abandoning the subtleties of the early Empire.

Beginning in the late 2nd century, the Empire began to suffer a series of political and economic crises, partially because it had overexpanded so much. The &quot;Pax Romana&quot; (&quot;Roman peace&quot;) is often said to have ended with the tyrannical reign of Commodus. His murder was followed by the accession of Septimius Severus, the victor of the Year of the Five Emperors. It was during his reign that the role of the army grew even more, and the emperors&#x27; power increasingly depended on it. The murder of his last relative, Severus Alexander, led to the Crisis of the Third Century (235–285), a 50-year period that almost saw the end of the Roman Empire. The last vestiges of Republicanism were lost in the ensuing anarchy. In 238, the Senate attempted to regain power by proclaiming Pupienus and Balbinus as their own emperors (the first time since Nerva). They managed to usurp power from Maximinus Thrax, but they were killed within two months. With the rise of the &quot;soldier emperors&quot;, the city and Senate of Rome began to lose importance. Maximinus and Carus, for example, did not even set foot on the city. Carus&#x27; successors Carinus and Numerian, the last of the Crisis emperors, did not bother to assume the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; either.

After reuniting the Roman Empire in 285, Diocletian began a series of reforms to restore stability. Reaching back to the oldest traditions of job-sharing in the Republic, Diocletian established at the top of this new structure the Tetrarchy (&quot;rule of four&quot;) in an attempt to provide for smoother succession and greater continuity of government. Under the Tetrarchy, Diocletian set in place a system of two emperors (&quot;augusti&quot;) and two subordinates that also served as heirs (&quot;caesares&quot;). When an emperor retired (as Diocletian and Maximian did in 305) or died, his &quot;caesar&quot; would succeed him and in turn appoint a new &quot;caesar&quot;. Each pair ruled over a half of the Empire, which led to the creation of a Western and Eastern Roman Empire, a division that eventually became permanent. This division had already a precedent in the joint rule of Valerian/Gallienus and Carus/Carinus.

Diocletian justified his rule not by military power, but by claiming divine right. He imitated Oriental divine kingship and encouraged the reverence of the emperor, making anything related to him &quot;sacer&quot; (sacred). He declared himself &quot;Jovius&quot;, the son of Jupiter, and his partner Maximian was declared &quot;Herculius&quot;, son of Hercules. This divine claim was maintained after the rise of Christianity, as emperors regarded themselves as the chosen rulers of God.

The emperor no longer needed the Senate to ratify his powers, so he became the sole source of law. These new laws were no longer shared publicly and were often given directly to the praetorian prefects – originally the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard, but now the head of the new praetorian prefectures – or with private officials. The emperor&#x27;s personal court and administration traveled alongside him, which further made the Senate&#x27;s role redundant. Consuls continued to be appointed each year, but by this point, it was an office often occupied by the emperor himself, who now had complete control over the bureaucratic apparatus. Diocletian did preserve some Republican traditions, such as the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;. The last known emperor to have used it was Anastasius I, at the start of the 6th century. Anastasius was also the last attested emperor to use the traditional titles of &quot;proconsul&quot; and &quot;pater patriae&quot;. The last attested emperor to use the title of consul was Constans II, who was also the last Eastern emperor to visit Rome. It&#x27;s possible that later emperors also used it as an honorary title, as the office of consul was not abolished until 892, during the reign of Leo VI.

During the Dominate it became increasingly common for emperors to raise their children directly to &quot;augustus&quot; (emperor) instead of &quot;caesar&quot; (heir), probably because of the failure of the Tetrarchy. This practice had first been applied by Septimius Severus, who proclaimed his 10-year-old son Caracalla as &quot;augustus&quot;. He was followed by Macrinus, who did the same with his 9-year-old son Diadumenian, and several other emperors during the Crisis. This became even more common from the 4th century onwards. Gratian was proclaimed emperor at the age of 8, and his co-ruler and successor Valentinian II was proclaimed emperor at the age of 4. Many child emperors such as Philip II or Diadumenian never succeeded their fathers. These co-emperors all had the same honors as their senior counterpart, but they did not share the actual government, hence why junior co-emperors are usually not counted as real emperors by modern or ancient historians. There was no title to denote the &quot;junior&quot; emperor; writers used the vague terms of &quot;second&quot; or &quot;little emperor&quot;.

Despite having a successful reign himself, Diocletian&#x27;s tetrarchic system collapsed as soon as he retired in 305. Constantine I, the son of tetrarch Constantius I, reunited the empire in 324 and imposed the principle of hereditary succession which Diocletian intended to avoid. Constantine was also the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and emperors after him, especially after its officialization under Theodosius I, saw themselves as the protectors of the Church. The territorial divisions of the Tetrarchy were maintained, and for most of the following century the Empire was ruled by two senior emperors, one in the West (with Milan and later Ravenna as capital) and another in the East (with Constantinople as capital).

This division became permanent on the death of Theodosius I in 395, when he was succeeded by his sons Honorius and Arcadius. The two halves of the Empire, while later functioning as &quot;de facto&quot; separate entities, were always considered and seen, legally and politically, as separate administrative divisions of a single, insoluble state by the Romans of the time.

In the West, the office of emperor soon degenerated into being little more than a puppet of Germanic generals such as Aetius and Ricimer; the last emperors of the West being known as the &quot;shadow emperor&quot;. In 476, the Heruli Odoacer overthrew the child-emperor Romulus Augustulus, made himself king of Italy and shipped the imperial regalia to the Emperor Zeno in Constantinople. Historians mark this date as the date of the fall of the Western Roman Empire, although by this time there was no longer any &quot;Empire&quot; left, as its territory had reduced to Italy. Julius Nepos, who was overthrown and expelled to Dalmatia in favor of Romulus, continued to claim the title until his murder in 480. The Eastern court recognized this claim and Odoacer minted coins in his name, although he never managed to exercise real power. The death of Nepos left Zeno as the sole emperor of a (technically) reunited Roman Empire.

=== Byzantine period ===
The Roman Empire survived in the East for another 1000 years, but the marginalization of the former heartland of Italy to the empire had a profound cultural impact on the empire and its emperor, which adopted a more Hellenistic character.

The Eastern emperors continued to be recognized in the Western kingdoms until the accession of Irene (r. 797–802), the first empress regnant. The Italian heartland was recovered during the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565), but this was reverted by the end of the century. Rome technically remained under imperial control, but was completely surrounded by the Lombards. Africa was lost to the Arabs in the early 7th century, and Rome eventually fell to the Lombards in 751, during the reign of Constantine V. The Frankish king Pepin the Short defeated them and received the favour of Pope Stephen II, who became the head of the Papal States. Pepin&#x27;s son, Charlemagne, was crowned &quot;Imperator Romanorum&quot; (the first time &quot;Imperator&quot; was used as an actual regnal title) by Pope Leo III in Christmas AD 800, thus ending the recognition of the Eastern emperor. Western rulers also began referring to the Empire as the &quot;Greek Empire&quot;, regarding themselves as the true successors of Rome.
The inhabitants of the Eastern half of the Empire always saw the emperor as an open monarch. Starting with Heraclius in 629, Roman emperors styled themselves &quot;basileus&quot;, the traditional title for Greek monarchs used since the times of Alexander the Great. The title was used since the early days of the Empire and became the common imperial title by the 3rd century, but did not appear in official documents until the 7th century. Michael I Rangabe (r. 811–813) was the first emperor to actually use the title of &quot;Roman emperor&quot; (βασιλεύς Ῥωμαίων, &quot;Basileus Romaíon&quot;). This was a response to the new line of emperors created by Charlemagnealthough he was recognized as &quot;basileus&quot; of the Franks. By the 9th century the full imperial title became &quot;&quot;basileus&quot; and &quot;autokrator&quot; of the Romans&quot;, usually translated as &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot;. The title &quot;autokrator&quot; was also used to distinguish a junior co-emperor (&quot;basileus&quot;) from his senior colleague (&quot;basileus autokrator&quot;). By the times of the Palaiologos, there were two distinct ceremonies for the accession of an emperor: first an acclamation as &quot;basileus&quot;, and later a coronation as &quot;autokrator&quot; (which also included being raised on a shield). These rites could happen years apart.

The Eastern Empire became not only an absolute monarchy but also a theocracy. According to George Ostrogorsky, &quot;the absolute power of the Roman emperor was further increased with the advent of Christian ideas&quot;. This became more evident after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, which gave Byzantine imperialism a new sense of purpose. The emperor was the subject of a series of rites and ceremonies, including a formal coronation performed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Byzantine state is often said to have followed a &quot;Caesaropapist&quot; model, where the emperor played the role of ruler and head of the Church, but there was often a clear distinction between political and secular power.

The line of Eastern emperors continued uninterrupted until the sack of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire in 1204. This led to the creation of three lines of emperors in exile: the emperors of Nicaea, the emperors of Trebizond, and the short-lived emperors of Thessalonica. The Nicean rulers have been traditionally regarded as the &quot;legitimate&quot; emperors of this period, as they recovered Constantinople and restored the Empire in 1261. The Empire of Trebizond continued to exist for another 200 years, but from 1282 onwards its rulers used the modified title of &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of all the East, the Iberians, and the Perateia&quot;, accepting the Niceans as the sole Roman emperors. However, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced mostly to Constantinople, and the rise of other powers such as Serbia and Bulgaria forced the Byzantines to recognize their rulers as &quot;basileus&quot;. Despite this, emperors continued to view themselves as the rulers of an &quot;universal empire&quot;. During the last decades of the Empire, power was once again shared between multiple emperors and colleagues, each ruling from their own capital, notably during the long reign of John V. Constantinople finally fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453; its last emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, dying in battle. The last vestiges of the empire, Morea and Trebizond, fell in 1461.

==Titles==
=== &quot;Imperator&quot; ===

The title &quot;imperator&quot; – from &quot;imperare&quot;, &quot;to command&quot; – dates back to the Roman Republic and was given to victorious commanders by their soldiers. They held &quot;imperium&quot;, that is, military authority. The Senate could then award the extraordinary honor of a triumph; the commander then retained the title until the end of his magistracy. In Roman tradition, the first triumph was that of Romulus, the founder of Rome, but the first attested use of &quot;imperator&quot; was in 189 BC, on the triumph of Aemilius Paulus. It was a title held with great pride: Pompey was hailed &quot;imperator&quot; more than once, as was Sulla and Julius Caesar. However, as noted by Cassius Dio, the meaning of the title changed under the new monarchy, and came to denote &quot;the possession of the supreme power&quot;. Both Dio and Suetonius refer to Caesar as the first one to assume &quot;imperator&quot; as a proper name (a &quot;praenomen imperatoris&quot;), but this seems to be an anachronism. The last ordinary general to be awarded the title was Junius Blaesus in AD 22, after which it became a title reserved solely for the sovereign.

Augustus used &quot;Imperator&quot; instead of his first name (&quot;praenomen&quot;), becoming &quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; instead of &quot;Caesar Imperator&quot;. From this the title slowly became a synonym of the office, hence the word &quot;emperor&quot;. Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius avoided using the title, but it is recorded that Caligula was hailed &quot;imperator&quot; by the Senate on his accession, indicating that it was already considered an integral part of the dignity. It was not until the late reign of Nero, in AD 66, that &quot;imperator&quot; became once more part of the emperor&#x27;s nomenclature. Virtually all emperors after him used the &quot;praenomen imperatoris&quot;, with only a few variations under his successors Galba and Vitellius. The original meaning of the title continued to be used for a time, with emperors registering the number of times they were hailed &quot;imperator&quot;. The title became the main appellation of the ruler by the time of Vespasian.

After the Tetrarchy, emperors began to be addressed as &quot;dominus noster&quot; (&quot;our Lord&quot;), although &quot;imperator&quot; continued to be used. The appellation of &quot;dominus&quot; was known and rejected by Augustus, but ordinary men of the Empire used it regularly. It began to used in official context starting with Septimius Severus, and was first officially adopted in coinage by Aurelian.

In the East, &quot;imperator&quot; was translated as &quot;autokrator&quot; (&quot;self-ruler&quot;), a title that continued to be used until the end of the Empire. This is the modern Greek word for &quot;emperor&quot; (). There are still some instances of &quot;imperator&quot; in official documents as late as the 9th century. Its last known use was on 866–867 coins of Michael III and his co-emperor Basil I, who are addressed as &quot;imperator&quot; and &quot;rex&quot; respectively. In the West, &quot;imperator&quot; was transformed into a monarchical title by Charlemagne, becoming the official Latin title of the Holy Roman Empire.

===&quot;Caesar&quot;===

Originally the &quot;cognomen&quot; (third name) of the dictator Gaius Julius Caesar, which was then inherited by Augustus and his relatives. Augustus used it as a family name (&quot;nomen&quot;), styling himself as &quot;Imp. Caesar&quot; instead of &quot;Imp. Julius Caesar&quot;. However, the nomen was still inherited by women (such as Julia the Younger) and appear in some inscriptions. After the death of Caligula, Augustus&#x27; great-grandson, his uncle Claudius was proclaimed emperor. He was not an official member of the Julia gens, but he was the grandson of Octavia, Augustus&#x27; sister, and thus still part of the family.

Following the suicide of Nero, the last descendant of Caesar, the new emperor Galba adopted the name of &quot;Servius Galba Caesar Augustus&quot;, thus making it part of the imperial title. Five days before his murder he adopted Piso Licinianus as his son and heir, renaming him as &quot;Servius Sulpicius Galba Caesar&quot;. After this &quot;Caesar&quot; came to denote the heir apparent, who would add the name to his own as heir and retain it upon accession as &quot;augustus&quot;. The only emperor not to assume it was Vitellius, who adopted the name &quot;Germanicus&quot; instead. Most emperors used it as their &quot;nomen&quot; – with &quot;Imperator&quot; as their &quot;praenomen&quot; – until the reign of Antoninus Pius, when it permanently became part of the formula &quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; [full name] &quot;Augustus&quot;. In the 3rd century, &quot;caesars&quot; also received the honorific of &quot;nobilissimus&quot; (&quot;most noble&quot;), which later evolved into a separate title.
During the Tetrarchy the powers of the &quot;caesar&quot; increased considerably, but following the accession of Constantine I it once more remained as a title for heirs with no significant power attached to it. The title slowly lost importance in the following decades, as emperors started to promote their sons directly to &quot;augustus&quot;. In the East, the title finally lost its imperial character in 705, when Justinian II awarded it to Tervel of Bulgaria. After this it became a court title bestowed to prominent figures of the government, and lost even more relevance after the creation of the title &quot;sebastokrator&quot; by Alexios I Komnenos. Despite this, its regular use by earlier emperors led to the name becoming synonym with &quot;emperor&quot; in certain regions. Several countries use &quot;Caesar&quot; as the origin of their word for &quot;emperor&quot;, like &quot;Kaiser&quot; in Germany and &quot;Tsar&quot; in Bulgaria and Russia.

After the Constantinian dynasty, emperors followed &quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; with &quot;Flavius&quot;, which also began as a family name but was later incorporated into the emperor&#x27;s titles, thus becoming &quot;Imperator Caesar Flavius&quot;. The last use of the formula, rendered as &quot;Autokrator Kaisar Flabios... Augoustos&quot; (Αὐτοκράτωρ καῖσαρ Φλάβιος αὐγουστος) in Greek, is in the &quot;Basilika&quot; of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912).

===&quot;Augustus&quot;===
Originally the main title of the emperor. According to Suetonius, it was &quot;not merely a new title but a more honorable one, inasmuch as sacred places too, and those in which anything is consecrated by augural rites are called &quot;august&quot; (&quot;augusta&quot;), from the increase (&quot;auctus&quot;) in dignity&quot;. It was also connected to the religious practice of augury, which was itself linked to Rome&#x27;s founding by Romulus, and to &quot;auctoritas&quot;, the authority based on prestige. The honorific was awarded as both a name and a title to Octavian in 27 BC and was inherited by all subsequent emperors, who placed it after their personal names. The only emperor to not immediately assume it was Vitellius, although he did use it after his recognition by the Senate. Later emperors ruled alongside one or several junior &quot;augusti&quot; who held &quot;de jure&quot; (but not &quot;de facto&quot;) equal constitutional power. Despite its use as the highest imperial title, it was generally not used to indicate the office of &quot;Emperor&quot; itself, as ordinary people and writers had become accustomed to &quot;Imperator&quot;.

In the East the title was initially translated as &quot;Sebastos&quot;, but the form &quot;Augoustos&quot; eventually became more common. Emperors after Heraclius styled themselves as &quot;Basileus&quot;, but &quot;Augoustos&quot; still remained in use in a lesser form up until the end of the Empire. In the West, the title was also used by Charlemagne and the subsequent Holy Roman Emperors as part of the formula &quot;Imperator Augustus&quot;. Both Eastern and Western rulers also used the style &quot;semper augustus&quot; (&quot;forever augustus&quot;).

===&quot;Princeps&quot;===
The word &quot;princeps&quot;, meaning &quot;first&quot;, was a republican term used to denote the leading member of the Senate, and it was used by the early emperors to emphasize the continuance of the Republic. The title had already been used by Pompey and Julius Caesar, among others. It was a purely honorific title with no attached duties or powers, hence why it was never used in official titulature. The title was the most preferred by Augustus as its use implies only &quot;primacy&quot; (is in the &quot;first among equals&quot;), as opposed to &quot;dominus&quot;, which implies dominance. It was the title used by early writers before the term &quot;imperator&quot; became popular. In his &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, Augustus explicitly refers to himself as the &quot;princeps senatus&quot;. The title was also sometimes given to heirs, in the form of &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;first of the youth&quot;), a term that continued to be used during the Tetrarchy.

In the era of Diocletian and beyond, &quot;princeps&quot; fell into disuse and was replaced with &quot;dominus&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;); the use of &quot;princeps&quot; and &quot;dominus&quot; broadly symbolizes the differences in the empire&#x27;s government, giving rise to the era designations Principate and Dominate. The title is still found in some later sources, however. The poet Claudian, for example, describes Honorius as having been raised from &quot;&quot;caesar&quot; to &quot;princeps&quot;&quot; (instead of &quot;augustus&quot;). The title survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as it was used by rulers such as Theodoric the Great.

=== &quot;Basileus&quot; / &quot;autokrator&quot; ===

&quot;Basileus&quot; was the traditional Greek title for monarchs. It was first used by Alexander the Great (r. 336–323 BC) during his conquests. The term was applied to emperors unofficially since the beginning of the Empire, but in official records it was often used as the Greek translation of the title &quot;rex&quot;, with &quot;autokrator&quot; (the Greek equivalent to &quot;imperator&quot;) reserved for the emperor. As a result, Western writers often associated &quot;basileus&quot; with &quot;king&quot; as opposed to &quot;emperor&quot;, despite this distinction not existing in Greek.

&quot;Basileus&quot; was first officially used by Heraclius in 629, after his victory over the Persians, and it became the main title of the emperor afterward. After the 9th century, the full imperial title became &quot;&quot;basileus&quot; and &quot;autokrator&quot; of the Romans&quot; (βασιλεύς καὶ αὐτοκράτωρ Ῥωμαίων), with &quot;autokrator&quot; distinguishing the senior emperor of the junior &quot;basileus&quot;. In later centuries, the title was shortened simply as &quot;&quot;autokrator&quot; of the Romans&quot;, resulting in a revival of that title. In later centuries, an emperor would typically be acclaimed as &quot;basileus&quot; as an infant and then crowned by the Patriarch as &quot;autokrator&quot;. Foreign rulers were usually referred to as &quot;reges&quot; (a Greek rendition of &quot;rex&quot;), but the Eastern emperors were eventually forced to recognize other monarchs as &quot;basileus&quot;, mainly the Latin, Holy Roman, Serbian and Bulgarian emperors.

==Later assertions to the title==
Despite overthrowing Roman rule, Odoacer never claimed the imperial dignity. His successor Theodoric the Great is sometimes said to have been an emperor in all but name, despite using the title of &quot;rex&quot; and recognizing the emperor in Constantinople. He also used the ancient title of &quot;princeps&quot; (in full, &quot;princeps Romanus&quot;) and &quot;dominus noster&quot;, actively trying to imitate the old emperors. He even requested and received the regalia sent to Constantinople by Odoacer, although it appears that he only requested the purple robes and not the imperial crown nor scepter.

The rebels Burdunellus and Peter, both active shortly after the fall of the West, are referred to as &quot;tyrants&quot; in sources. This may imply that they claimed the imperial indignity, although there is almost no information available for these rebellions. The Berber governor Masties assumed the title of &quot;imperator&quot; shortly after 476, claiming to rule over the &quot;Romans and Maurians.&quot; The last attempt to restore the office of emperor in the West was during the Siege of Ravenna (539–540), when the Goths offered Belisarius the throne, which he refused.

==Number of emperors==

Several ancient writers tried to count the number of Roman emperors through history, but each of them gives a different count. The 4th-century historian Festus states that &quot;From Octavian Caesar Augustus to Jovian, there were &quot;imperatores&quot;, 43 in number, through 407 years [reckoning from 43 BC]&quot;. The 6th-century &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; calls Diocletian the &quot;33rd Roman emperor&quot;. Adding the eight other emperors mentioned in the work would give a total of 41 emperors up until Constantine I.

A few writers also attempted to make their own lists of emperors. The 4th-century calligrapher Filocalus, in his &quot;Chronographia&quot;, records 58 emperors from Augustus to Constantine. His contemporary Epiphanius records 44 emperors in his work &quot;On Weights and Measures&quot;. The 13th-century &quot;Chronicon Altinate&quot; records 46 emperors in the same time period. These discrepancies arise from the fact that there was never a defining distinction between &quot;legitimate emperors&quot; and &quot;usurpers&quot;. Other emperors had such uneventful or brief reigns that they are unmentioned by literary sources, like Licinius&#x27;s co-emperors Valerius Valens and Martinian.

<text>The Donation of Constantine () is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 9th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy.

In many of the existing manuscripts, including the oldest, the document bears the title &quot;Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris&quot;. The Donation of Constantine was included in the 9th-century Pseudo-Isidorean decretals. Lorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440, although the document&#x27;s authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.

== Content ==
An alleged decree from Roman Emperor Constantine I, dated March 30 and not explicitly stating its year, incorrectly references the co-consul of Constantine I in his fourth term (315) as Gallicanus (317). Historical records confirm that these two never served as consuls together, indicating this as evidence of the document&#x27;s forged nature. The forged imperial decree states that &quot;Constantine&quot; professes Christianity (&quot;confessio&quot;) and entitles to Pope Sylvester several imperial insignia and privileges (&quot;donatio&quot;), as well as the Lateran Palace. Rome, the rest of Italy, and the western provinces of the empire are made over to the papacy.

The text recounts a narrative founded on the 5th-century &quot;Acts of Sylvester&quot;. This tale describes the sainted Pope Sylvester&#x27;s rescue of the Romans from the depredations of a local dragon and the pontiff&#x27;s miraculous cure of the emperor&#x27;s leprosy by the sacrament of baptism. The story was rehearsed by the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;; by the later 8th century the dragon-slayer Sylvester and his apostolic successors were rewarded in the Donation of Constantine with temporal powers never in fact exercised by the historical Bishops of Rome under Constantine&quot;.&quot;

In his gratitude, &quot;Constantine&quot; determined to bestow on the seat of Peter &quot;power, and dignity of glory, vigor, and imperial honor,&quot; and &quot;supremacy as well over the four principal sees: Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, as also over all the churches of God in the whole earth&quot;. For the upkeep of the church of Saint Peter and that of Saint Paul, he gave landed estates &quot;in Judea, Greece, Asia, Thrace, Africa, Italy and the various islands&quot;. To Sylvester and his successors he also granted imperial insignia, the tiara, and &quot;the city of Rome, and all the provinces, places and cities of Italy and the western regions&quot;.

The Donation sought reduction in the authority of Constantinople; if Constantine had elevated Sylvester to imperial rank before the 330 inauguration of Constantinople, then Rome&#x27;s patriarch had a lead of some fifteen years in the contest for primacy among the patriarchates. Implicitly, the papacy asserted its supremacy and prerogative to transfer the imperial seat; the papacy had consented to the &quot;translatio imperii&quot; to Byzantium by Constantine and it could wrest back the authority at will.

== Origin ==
It has been suggested that an early draft of the Donation of Constantine was made shortly after the middle of the 8th century, in order to assist Pope Stephen II in his negotiations with Pepin the Short, who then held the position of Mayor of the Palace (i.e., the manager of the household of the Frankish king). In 754, Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps to anoint Pepin king, thereby enabling the Carolingian family to supplant the old Merovingian royal line. In return for Stephen&#x27;s support, Pepin gave the pope the lands in Italy which the Lombards had taken from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. It is also possible it originated in the chancery of Stephen&#x27;s immediate successor Paul I. These lands would become the Papal States and would be the basis of the papacy&#x27;s temporal power for the next eleven centuries.

Another interpretation holds that the Donation was not an official forgery directed at Constantinople, but was instead a ploy in Roman ecclesiastical politics to bolster the status of the Lateran, which does have historical Constantinian connections, against the rising status of the Vatican, and it may have been composed by a Greek monk working in a Roman monastery. In one study, an attempt was made at dating the forgery to the 9th century, and placing its composition at Corbie Abbey, in northern France.

German medievalist Johannes Fried draws a distinction between the Donation of Constantine and an earlier, also forged version, the &quot;Constitutum Constantini&quot;, which was included in the collection of forged documents, the False Decretals, compiled in the latter half of the 9th century. Fried argues the Donation is a later expansion of the much shorter &quot;Constitutum&quot;. Christopher B. Coleman understands the mention in the &quot;Constitutum&quot; of a donation of &quot;the western regions&quot; to refer to the regions of Lombardia, Veneto, and Istria.

== Medieval use and reception ==
What may perhaps be the earliest known allusion to the Donation is in a letter of 778, in which Pope Hadrian I exhorts Charlemagne – whose father, Pepin the Short, had made the Donation of Pepin granting the Popes sovereignty over the Papal States – to follow Constantine&#x27;s example and endow the Roman Catholic church. Otto III&#x27;s chancery denied its authenticity.

The first pope to directly invoke the decree was Pope Leo IX, in a letter sent in 1054 to Michael I Cerularius, Patriarch of Constantinople. He cited a large portion of the document, believing it genuine, furthering the debate that would ultimately lead to the East–West Schism. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Donation was often cited in the investiture conflicts between the papacy and the secular powers in the West.

The document&#x27;s contents contradicted the Byzantines&#x27; notion that Constantine&#x27;s &quot;translatio imperii&quot; transferred the seat of imperial authority from Rome to his foundation of Constantinople, named the &quot;New Rome&quot;. Consequently, the Donation featured in the east–west dispute over ecclesiastical primacy between the patriarchal sees of Rome and New Rome. Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida also issued a version of the document to support the papacy&#x27;s claims against the eastern emperors&#x27; and patriarchs&#x27; primacy.

By the 12th century the text existed in Greek translation, of which a 14th-century manuscript survives, and Byzantine writers were also using the Donation in their polemics; John Kinnamos, writing in the reign of eastern emperor Manuel I Komnenos, criticized western Staufer emperors as usurpers and denied the popes had the right to bestow the imperial office. Theodore Balsamon justified Michael Cerularius&#x27;s behaviour in 1054 using the Donation as a rationale for his dismissal of the papal legation and the mutual excommunications that followed.

In 1248, the Chapel of St Sylvester in the Basilica of the Santi Quattro Coronati was decorated with fresco showing the story of the Roman baptism and Donation of Constantine.

In his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, written in the early 14th century, the poet Dante Alighieri wrote:

== Investigation ==
During the Middle Ages, the Donation was widely accepted as authentic, although Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor did possibly raise suspicions of the document &quot;in letters of gold&quot; as a forgery, in making a gift to the See of Rome. It was not until the mid-15th century, with the revival of Classical scholarship and textual criticism, that humanists, and eventually the papal bureaucracy, began to realize that the document could not possibly be genuine. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa declared it to be a forgery and spoke of it as an apocryphal work.
Later, the humanist and scholar Lorenzo Valla argued in his philological study of the text that the language used in manuscript could not be dated to the 4th century. The language of the text suggests that the manuscript can most likely be dated to the 8th century. Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he suspected that the Church knew the document to be inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the &quot;overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.&quot;

Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation is a forgery are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as &quot;fief&quot; were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).

Pope Pius II wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming pope, to show that though the Donation was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to Charlemagne and its powers of the keys to Peter; however, he did not publish it.

Contemporary opponents of papal powers in Italy emphasized the primacy of civil law and civil jurisdiction, now firmly embodied once again in the Justinian &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Cavalcanti reported that, in the very year of Valla&#x27;s treatise, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward Cosimo de&#x27; Medici in Florence, proposing an alliance against the pope. In reference to the Donation, Visconti wrote: &quot;It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts – which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found – he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the empire takes precedence over any lordship.&quot;

Later, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester&#x27;s curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. Wolfram Setz, a recent editor of Valla&#x27;s work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla&#x27;s refutation, Constantine&#x27;s alleged &quot;donation&quot; was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in political theory and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.

The bulls of Nicholas V and his successors made no further mention of the Donation, even when partitioning the New World, though the doctrine of &quot;omni-insular&quot; papal fiefdoms, developed out of the Donation&#x27;s vague references to islands since Pope Nicholas II&#x27;s grant of Sicily to Robert Guiscard, was deployed after 1492 in papal pronouncements on the overlapping claims of the Iberian kingdoms in the Americas and Moluccas, including &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, a bull that resulted in the Treaty of Tordesillas and the Treaty of Zaragoza. Valla&#x27;s treatise was taken up vehemently by writers of the Protestant Reformation, such as Ulrich von Hutten and Martin Luther, causing the treatise to be placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; in the mid-16th century.

The Donation continued to be tacitly accepted as authentic until Caesar Baronius in his &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; (published 1588–1607) admitted that it was a forgery, after which it was almost universally accepted as such. Some continued to argue for its authenticity; nearly a century after &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot;, Christian Wolff still alluded to the Donation as undisputed fact.

<text>Otrona Advanced Systems Corporation was an early Colorado manufacturer of business portable CP/M and MS-DOS compatible computers.

==Otrona Attaché and 8:16==
The American company&#x27;s first major product, the &quot;Otrona Attaché&quot;, came out in April 1982 and folded up to the size of a fat briefcase painted off-white with orange trim. When set up for use, the carrying handle swung under the chassis to prop it up for easier viewing. A keyboard could be removed from one end, revealing a small 5-inch monochrome CRT and two 360Kb &quot;half-height&quot; 5.25 inch floppy disk drives.

The system featured a Zilog Z80A microprocessor at running 4 MHz, used the CP/M version 2 operating system with 64K of RAM and, with installation of an Intel 8086 microprocessor expansion card, a modified version of Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS operating system. The RAM can be upgraded to 640Kb and had several programs in ROM. It contained a single speaker for sound output (which could be set to give audible feedback when keys were pressed) and two RS-422 serial ports for communication. It also supported monochrome bit-mapped graphics, and introduced the concept of &quot;desk accessory&quot; programs, such as a calendar, calculator and auto-run timer that could be run without closing a user application. This innovative application set, known as Valet, predated the appearance of similar functionality in the 1984 Macintosh.

The brainchild of Ron Lingeman, a gifted H-P alumnus, the Attache was significantly smaller, sleeker, lighter and faster than the Osborne 1 and other portable computers of the time. Unlike the Kaypro, Attache was not IBM compatible. The Attache was both more capable and more expensive than its competition in many ways. The Attache was meant to run on AC power; batteries were not part of the package but an external battery could be attached.

The 1983 &quot;8:16&quot; model included the 8086 coprocessor expansion board as a built-in option. Compatibility with the IBM PC was only partial, but allowed the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application to run on the Attache.

==Otrona 2001==
In May 1984, Otrona introduced the &quot;2001&quot; model an IBM PC compatible which had an Intel 8088 CPU as its primary microprocessor. This model was meant to be a lighter weight and technologically superior alternative to the mainstream IBM and Compaq luggable products of the day. Otrona engaged in a ground up development effort of the more, but not yet fully, PC-compatible &quot;2001&quot; computer, incorporating a PC BIOS written by Steve Gray.

This model&#x27;s larger CRT was hinged, pivoting upward for easier viewing while boasting twice the resolution of standard PC&#x27;s. While retaining its low weight (for the time), it also offered a hard disk option, an Z80A CPU card for CP/M compatibility and, unlike the 8:16 model, provided greater PC compatibility with more than twice the speed of a standard PC. Despite the innovative packaging, added features and superior performance, this $3,995 product ended up costing more than anticipated to produce, and never had a chance to succeed as it pushed further the failure of Otrona that filed for bankruptcy shortly after its release.

Market acceptance of the IBM PC and lagging sales of the not quite PC-compatible 8:16 and 2001 models created a revenue gap that was too deep to overcome. Otrona was caught in a catch-22 in which they could not buy parts needed to generate revenue with the 2001 and could not hit the revenue targets needed to draw on their credit line in order to buy the needed parts. By this time the banks and venture capitalists had invested heavily and taken a hard-edged approach to further investment. Despite the pending success of the 2001, they declined to provide further funding. Otrona had simply not responded quickly enough to the new market conditions created by the introduction of the IBM PC.

== Bankruptcy ==

After seven years of innovation, Otrona announced in September 1984 that it was ceasing production and gave immediate termination notices to its 175 employees. The company initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, hoping to find a way to recover, but refiled a few days later under Chapter 7 and its assets were subsequently liquidated.

About 5,000 of the Attache model were sold and can still be found occasionally in auctions and flea markets. The 2001 model barely made a mark at all and probably ranks as one of the rarest of the early PC clones.

<text>John Maron (, &quot;Youhana Maroun&quot;; ; ; 628, Sirmaniyah or Sarmin, Byzantine Empire – 707, Kfarhy, Umayyad Caliphate), was a Syriac monk. and the first Maronite Patriarch. He is revered as a saint by the Catholic Church, especially the Maronite Church, and is commemorated on March 2. He died and was buried in Kfarhy near Batroun, in Lebanon, where a shrine is dedicated to him.

Jérôme Labourt, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says that John Maron&#x27;s &quot;very existence is extremely doubtful... if he existed at all, it was as a simple monk&quot;. French theologian Eusèbe Renaudot similarly held doubts regarding John Maron&#x27;s existence. Other scholarship has assessed John Maron as having existed and served as Maronite Patriarch when invasions by Byzantine emperor Justinian II were repulsed and the Maronite people gained a greater degree of political independence.

==Early life==

Maronite history prior to the sixteenth century is problematic as so many points are obscure. According to Maronite sources, John was born in Sarum, a town located south of the city of Antioch. He was the son of Agathon and Anohamia. He was called John the Sarumite since his father was governor of Sarum. His paternal grandfather, Prince Alidipas, was the nephew of Carloman, a Frankish Prince, and governed Antioch. John was educated in Antioch and the Monastery of Saint Maron, studying mathematics, sciences, philosophy, theology, philology and scripture. He became a monk at the monastery, adding the name Maron to his own.

John studied Greek and patrology in Constantinople. Returning to Saint Maron&#x27;s, he wrote on such diverse topics as teaching, rhetoric, the sacraments, management of Church property, legislative techniques, and liturgy. He composed the Eucharistic Prayer which still bears his name. As a young priest he engaged himself in ecumenical debates with the Monophysites. Noted as a teacher and preacher, he explained the doctrine of the Council of Chalcedon (which focused on the nature of Jesus as both God and human), wrote a series of letters to the faithful against Monophysitism which Beit-Marun then adopted, after which he purportedly travelled Syria to explain the heresy.

==The first Maronite Patriarch==

The Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II was martyred in 609. With the ongoing Byzantine–Sasanian War and general unrest in the area, Constantinople began to appoint a series of titular patriarchs. Maronite sources give the date of John Maron&#x27;s election to Patriarch of Antioch and All the East as 685. John received the approval of Pope Sergius I, and became the first Maronite Patriarch.

<text>David Keith Murray (born February 19, 1955) is an American jazz saxophonist and composer who performs mostly on tenor and bass clarinet. He has recorded prolifically for many record labels since the mid-1970s. He lives in New York City.

==Biography==
Murray was born in Oakland, California, United States. He attended Pomona College for two years as a member of the class of 1977, ultimately receiving an honorary degree in 2012. He was initially influenced by free jazz musicians such as Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman and Archie Shepp. He gradually evolved a more diverse style in his playing and compositions. Murray set himself apart from most tenor players of his generation by not taking John Coltrane as his model, choosing instead to incorporate elements of mainstream players Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Paul Gonsalves into his mature style. Despite this, he recorded a tribute to Coltrane, &quot;Octet Plays Trane&quot;, in 1999. 

Murray was a founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet with Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill and Hamiet Bluiett. He has recorded or performed with musicians such as Henry Threadgill, James Blood Ulmer, Olu Dara, Tani Tabbal, Butch Morris, Donal Fox, McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, Sunny Murray (no relation), Ed Blackwell, Johnny Dyani, Fred Hopkins, Don Pullen, Randy Weston and Steve McCall. David Murray&#x27;s use of the circular breathing technique has enabled him to play astonishingly long phrases.

In 2024, Murray released an album with his new quartet: Francesca, with Marta Sanchez (piano), Luke Stewart (bass) and Russell Carter (drums). His wife Francesca Cinelli Murray produced and directed a video animation for the title “Ninno”, in collaboration with painter and animator Nancy Ostrovsky. 

Francesca was selected #2 2024 Best Jazz Album of the Year by the New York Times and among the best jazz albums of the year by Downbeat.

David Murray quartet next album will be released in spring 2025 with Verve Records.

<text>Semyon Alekseyevich Lavochkin (; 11 September 1900 - 9 June 1960) was a Soviet aerospace engineer, Soviet aircraft designer who founded the Lavochkin aircraft design bureau. Many of his fighter designs were produced in large numbers for Soviet forces during World War II.

==Biography==

Lavochkin was born to a family of teachers in Smolensk. After graduation in 1918, he enlisted in the Red Army and served in the infantry in the Russian Civil War. In 1920, he began studies at the Moscow State Technical University, from which he graduated in 1927. He then served for two years as an intern at the design department of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute under the direction of Andrei Tupolev, where he assisted in the design of the Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. While at TsAGI, his colleagues included the French seaplane designer Paul Richard, as well as Mikhail Gurevich and Nikolay Kamov.

In the early 1930s, he transferred to the Central Design Office, where he was assigned work on stratospheric aircraft, balloons and pressurized cockpits. However, as he came increasingly interested in the design of fighter aircraft, he moved to the design office of Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich, whom he assisted in the development of the Grigorovich I-Z fighter.

In 1938, after combat experiences in the Spanish Civil War and at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Japanese, it became clear that the Soviet fighter designs were lagging behind international standards. Lavochkin established his own design bureau in 1939. Starting with the LaGG-1, he produced thousands of fighters which formed the backbone of the Soviet Air Force during the Second World War. He is especially known for the La-5 and La-7, which are among the best Soviet fighter aircraft of World War II. The top Allied ace, Ivan Kozhedub shot down over 60 German airplanes, flying in fighters designed by Lavochkin. From 1941 to 1945 a total of over 22,000 Lavochkin fighters were produced.

However, Lavochkin&#x27;s fortunes faded after the war. His La-9 and La-11 were the last piston-engined fighters in Soviet service, and were replaced after a short time by jets. Although he continued pioneering work in this field (the La-176 was the first Soviet supersonic aircraft), his aircraft consistently placed second in competitions with other design bureaux, notably that of Artem Mikoyan.

At the end of WWII, forward thinking and competition in jet engine driven planes in Soviet Union pushed Lavochkin to start development of rocket systems. The outcome of that decision was SA-2 Guideline and a Burya. The LA-350 (Burya) is notable for the first in the world production use of Titanium and a thruster cooling by use of reverse flow of propellent.

In 1944, Lavochkin was given the honorary rank of Major-General of Engineering/Technical Service. From 1950 to 1958, Lavochkin also served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He also became an Academician of USSR Academy of Sciences in 1958. He died in 1960 due to a heart attack during a test of an air defense system in the Kazakh SSR at the age of 59 and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.

After his death the focus of the design office shifted to surface to air missiles (most notably the SA-2 Guideline), and to space projects.

<doc id="219144" wikidata="Q2705141" url="?curid=219144" title="Compressible flow">
<text>Compressible flow (or gas dynamics) is the branch of fluid mechanics that deals with flows having significant changes in fluid density. While all flows are compressible, flows are usually treated as being incompressible when the Mach number (the ratio of the speed of the flow to the speed of sound) is smaller than 0.3 (since the density change due to velocity is about 5% in that case). The study of compressible flow is relevant to high-speed aircraft, jet engines, rocket motors, high-speed entry into a planetary atmosphere, gas pipelines, commercial applications such as abrasive blasting, and many other fields.

==History==
The study of gas dynamics is often associated with the flight of modern high-speed aircraft and atmospheric reentry of space-exploration vehicles; however, its origins lie with simpler machines. At the beginning of the 19th century, investigation into the behaviour of fired bullets led to improvement in the accuracy and capabilities of guns and artillery. As the century progressed, inventors such as Gustaf de Laval advanced the field, while researchers such as Ernst Mach sought to understand the physical phenomena involved through experimentation.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the focus of gas dynamics research shifted to what would eventually become the aerospace industry. Ludwig Prandtl and his students proposed important concepts ranging from the boundary layer to supersonic shock waves, supersonic wind tunnels, and supersonic nozzle design. Theodore von Kármán, a student of Prandtl, continued to improve the understanding of supersonic flow. Other notable figures (Meyer, , and Ascher Shapiro) also contributed significantly to the principles considered fundamental to the study of modern gas dynamics. Many others also contributed to this field.

Accompanying the improved conceptual understanding of gas dynamics in the early 20th century was a public misconception that there existed a barrier to the attainable speed of aircraft, commonly referred to as the &quot;sound barrier.&quot; In truth, the barrier to supersonic flight was merely a technological one, although it was a stubborn barrier to overcome. Amongst other factors, conventional aerofoils saw a dramatic increase in drag coefficient when the flow approached the speed of sound. Overcoming the larger drag proved difficult with contemporary designs, thus the perception of a sound barrier. However, aircraft design progressed sufficiently to produce the Bell X-1. Piloted by Chuck Yeager, the X-1 officially achieved supersonic speed in October 1947. 

Historically, two parallel paths of research have been followed in order to further gas dynamics knowledge. Experimental gas dynamics undertakes wind tunnel model experiments and experiments in shock tubes and ballistic ranges with the use of optical techniques to document the findings. Theoretical gas dynamics considers the equations of motion applied to a variable-density gas, and their solutions. Much of basic gas dynamics is analytical, but in the modern era Computational fluid dynamics applies computing power to solve the otherwise-intractable nonlinear partial differential equations of compressible flow for specific geometries and flow characteristics.

==Introductory concepts==

There are several important assumptions involved in the underlying theory of compressible flow. All fluids are composed of molecules, but tracking a huge number of individual molecules in a flow (for example at atmospheric pressure) is unnecessary. Instead, the continuum assumption allows us to consider a flowing gas as a continuous substance except at low densities. This assumption provides a huge simplification which is accurate for most gas-dynamic problems. Only in the low-density realm of rarefied gas dynamics does the motion of individual molecules become important.

A related assumption is the no-slip condition where the flow velocity at a solid surface is presumed equal to the velocity of the surface itself, which is a direct consequence of assuming continuum flow. The no-slip condition implies that the flow is viscous, and as a result a boundary layer forms on bodies traveling through the air at high speeds, much as it does in low-speed flow.

Most problems in incompressible flow involve only two unknowns: pressure and velocity, which are typically found by solving the two equations that describe conservation of mass and of linear momentum, with the fluid density presumed constant. In compressible flow, however, the gas density and temperature also become variables. This requires two more equations in order to solve compressible-flow problems: an equation of state for the gas and a conservation of energy equation. For the majority of gas-dynamic problems, the simple ideal gas law is the appropriate state equation. Otherwise, more complex equations of state must be considered and the so-called non ideal compressible fluids dynamics (NICFD) establishes.

Fluid dynamics problems have two overall types of references frames, called Lagrangian and Eulerian (see Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Leonhard Euler). The Lagrangian approach follows a fluid mass of fixed identity as it moves through a flowfield. The Eulerian reference frame, in contrast, does not move with the fluid. Rather it is a fixed frame or control volume that fluid flows through. The Eulerian frame is most useful in a majority of compressible flow problems, but requires that the equations of motion be written in a compatible format.

Finally, although space is known to have 3 dimensions, an important simplification can be had in describing gas dynamics mathematically if only one spatial dimension is of primary importance, hence 1-dimensional flow is assumed. This works well in duct, nozzle, and diffuser flows where the flow properties change mainly in the flow direction rather than perpendicular to the flow. However, an important class of compressible flows, including the external flow over bodies traveling at high speed, requires at least a 2-dimensional treatment. When all 3 spatial dimensions and perhaps the time dimension as well are important, we often resort to computerized solutions of the governing equations.

==Mach number, wave motion, and sonic speed== 
The Mach number (M) is defined as the ratio of the speed of an object (or of a flow) to the speed of sound. For instance, in air at room temperature, the speed of sound is about . M can range from 0 to ∞, but this broad range falls naturally into several flow regimes. These regimes are subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, and hypervelocity flow. The figure below illustrates the Mach number &quot;spectrum&quot; of these flow regimes.

These flow regimes are not chosen arbitrarily, but rather arise naturally from the strong mathematical background that underlies compressible flow (see the cited reference textbooks). At very slow flow speeds the speed of sound is so much faster that it is mathematically ignored, and the Mach number is irrelevant. Once the speed of the flow approaches the speed of sound, however, the Mach number becomes all-important, and shock waves begin to appear. Thus the transonic regime is described by a different (and much more complex) mathematical treatment. In the supersonic regime the flow is dominated by wave motion at oblique angles similar to the Mach angle. Above about Mach 5, these wave angles grow so small that a different mathematical approach is required, defining the hypersonic speed regime. Finally, at speeds comparable to that of planetary atmospheric entry from orbit, in the range of several km/s, the speed of sound is now comparatively so slow that it is once again mathematically ignored in the hypervelocity regime.

As an object accelerates from subsonic toward supersonic speed in a gas, different types of wave phenomena occur. To illustrate these changes, the next figure shows a stationary point (M = 0) that emits symmetric sound waves. The speed of sound is the same in all directions in a uniform fluid, so these waves are simply concentric spheres. As the sound-generating point begins to accelerate, the sound waves &quot;bunch up&quot; in the direction of motion and &quot;stretch out&quot; in the opposite direction. When the point reaches sonic speed (M = 1), it travels at the same speed as the sound waves it creates. Therefore, an infinite number of these sound waves &quot;pile up&quot; ahead of the point, forming a Shock wave. Upon achieving supersonic flow, the particle is moving so fast that it continuously leaves its sound waves behind. When this occurs, the locus of these waves trailing behind the point creates an angle known as the Mach wave angle or Mach angle, μ:

:formula_1

where formula_2 represents the speed of sound in the gas and formula_3 represents the velocity of the object. Although named for Austrian physicist Ernst Mach, these oblique waves were first discovered by Christian Doppler.

==One-dimensional flow==
One-dimensional (1-D) flow refers to flow of gas through a duct or channel in which the flow parameters are assumed to change significantly along only one spatial dimension, namely, the duct length. In analysing the 1-D channel flow, a number of assumptions are made: 
*Ratio of duct length to width (L/D) is ≤ about 5 (in order to neglect friction and heat transfer), 
*Steady vs. Unsteady Flow,
*Flow is isentropic (i.e. a reversible adiabatic process), 
*Ideal gas law (i.e. P = ρRT)

===Converging-diverging Laval nozzles===
As the speed of a flow accelerates from the subsonic to the supersonic regime, the physics of nozzle and diffuser flows is altered. Using the conservation laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, the following relationship for channel flow is developed (combined mass and momentum conservation):

:formula_4, 
where dP is the differential change in pressure, M is the Mach number, ρ is the density of the gas, V is the velocity of the flow, A is the area of the duct, and dA is the change in area of the duct. This equation states that, for subsonic flow, a converging duct (dA &lt; 0) increases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA &gt; 0) decreases velocity of the flow. For supersonic flow, the opposite occurs due to the change of sign of (1 − M2). A converging duct (dA &lt; 0) now decreases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA &gt; 0) increases the velocity of the flow. At Mach = 1, a special case occurs in which the duct area must be either a maximum or minimum. For practical purposes, only a minimum area can accelerate flows to Mach 1 and beyond. See table of sub-supersonic diffusers and nozzles.

Therefore, to accelerate a flow to Mach 1, a nozzle must be designed to converge to a minimum cross-sectional area and then expand. This type of nozzle – the converging-diverging nozzle – is called a de Laval nozzle after Gustaf de Laval, who invented it. As subsonic flow enters the converging duct and the area decreases, the flow accelerates. Upon reaching the minimum area of the duct, also known as the throat of the nozzle, the flow can reach Mach 1. If the speed of the flow is to continue to increase, its density must decrease in order to obey conservation of mass. To achieve this decrease in density, the flow must expand, and to do so, the flow must pass through a diverging duct. See image of de Laval Nozzle.

===Maximum achievable velocity of a gas===
Ultimately, because of the energy conservation law, a gas is limited to a certain maximum velocity based on its energy content. The maximum velocity, &quot;V&quot;max, that a gas can attain is:

:formula_5

where cp is the specific heat of the gas and Tt is the stagnation temperature of the flow.

===Isentropic flow Mach number relationships===
Using conservations laws and thermodynamics, a number of relationships of the form

:formula_6
can be obtained, where M is the Mach number and γ is the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air). See table of isentropic flow Mach number relationships. 

===Achieving supersonic flow===
As previously mentioned, in order for a flow to become supersonic, it must pass through a duct with a minimum area, or sonic throat. Additionally, an overall pressure ratio, Pb/Pt, of approximately 2 is needed to attain Mach 1. Once it has reached Mach 1, the flow at the throat is said to be &quot;choked&quot;. Because changes downstream can only move upstream at sonic speed, the mass flow through the nozzle cannot be affected by changes in downstream conditions after the flow is choked.

===Non-isentropic 1D channel flow of a gas - normal shock waves===
Normal shock waves are shock waves that are perpendicular to the local flow direction. These shock waves occur when pressure waves build up and coalesce into an extremely thin shockwave that converts kinetic energy into thermal energy. The waves thus overtake and reinforce one another, forming a finite shock wave from an infinite series of infinitesimal sound waves. Because the change of state across the shock is highly irreversible, entropy increases across the shock. When analysing a normal shock wave, one-dimensional, steady, and adiabatic flow of a perfect gas is assumed. Stagnation temperature and stagnation enthalpy are the same upstream and downstream of the shock.

Normal shock waves can be easily analysed in either of two reference frames: the standing normal shock and the moving shock. The flow before a normal shock wave must be supersonic, and the flow after a normal shock must be subsonic. The Rankine-Hugoniot equations are used to solve for the flow conditions.

==Two-dimensional flow==
Although one-dimensional flow can be directly analysed, it is merely a specialized case of two-dimensional flow. It follows that one of the defining phenomena of one-dimensional flow, a normal shock, is likewise only a special case of a larger class of oblique shocks. Further, the name &quot;normal&quot; is with respect to geometry rather than frequency of occurrence. Oblique shocks are much more common in applications such as: aircraft inlet design, objects in supersonic flight, and (at a more fundamental level) supersonic nozzles and diffusers. Depending on the flow conditions, an oblique shock can either be attached to the flow or detached from the flow in the form of a bow shock.

===Oblique shock waves===
Oblique shock waves are similar to normal shock waves, but they occur at angles less than 90° with the direction of flow. When a disturbance is introduced to the flow at a nonzero angle (δ), the flow must respond to the changing boundary conditions. Thus an oblique shock is formed, resulting in a change in the direction of the flow.

====Shock polar diagram====

Based on the level of flow deflection (δ), oblique shocks are characterized as either strong or weak. Strong shocks are characterized by larger deflection and more entropy loss across the shock, with weak shocks as the opposite. In order to gain cursory insight into the differences in these shocks, a shock polar diagram can be used. With the static temperature after the shock, T*, known the speed of sound after the shock is defined as,
:formula_7

with R as the gas constant and γ as the specific heat ratio. The Mach number can be broken into Cartesian coordinates
:formula_8

with Vx and Vy as the x and y-components of the fluid velocity V. With the Mach number before the shock given, a locus of conditions can be specified. At some , the flow transitions from a strong to weak oblique shock. With δ = 0°, a normal shock is produced at the limit of the strong oblique shock and the Mach wave is produced at the limit of the weak shock wave.

====Oblique shock reflection====
Due to the inclination of the shock, after an oblique shock is created, it can interact with a boundary in three different manners, two of which are explained below.

=====Solid boundary=====
Incoming flow is first turned by angle δ with respect to the flow. This shockwave is reflected off the solid boundary, and the flow is turned by – δ to again be parallel with the boundary. Each progressive shock wave is weaker and the wave angle is increased.

=====Irregular reflection=====
An irregular reflection is much like the case described above, with the caveat that δ is larger than the maximum allowable turning angle. Thus a detached shock is formed and a more complicated reflection known as Mach reflection occurs.

===Prandtl–Meyer fans===

Prandtl–Meyer fans can be expressed as both compression and expansion fans. Prandtl–Meyer fans also cross a boundary layer (i.e. flowing and solid) which reacts in different changes as well. When a shock wave hits a solid surface the resulting fan returns as one from the opposite family while when one hits a free boundary the fan returns as a fan of opposite type.

====Prandtl–Meyer expansion fans====

To this point, the only flow phenomena that have been discussed are shock waves, which slow the flow and increase its entropy. It is possible to accelerate supersonic flow in what has been termed a Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan, after Ludwig Prandtl and Theodore Meyer. The mechanism for the expansion is shown in the figure below.

As opposed to the flow encountering an inclined obstruction and forming an oblique shock, the flow expands around a convex corner and forms an expansion fan through a series of isentropic Mach waves. The expansion &quot;fan&quot; is composed of Mach waves that span from the initial Mach angle to the final Mach angle. Flow can expand around either a sharp or rounded corner equally, as the increase in Mach number is proportional to only the convex angle of the passage (δ). The expansion corner that produces the Prandtl–Meyer fan can be sharp (as illustrated in the figure) or rounded. If the total turning angle is the same, then the P-M flow solution is also the same.

The Prandtl–Meyer expansion can be seen as the physical explanation of the operation of the Laval nozzle. The contour of the nozzle creates a smooth and continuous series of Prandtl–Meyer expansion waves.

====Prandtl–Meyer compression fans====

A Prandtl–Meyer compression is the opposite phenomenon to a Prandtl–Meyer expansion. If the flow is gradually turned through an angle of δ, a compression fan can be formed. This fan is a series of Mach waves that eventually coalesce into an oblique shock. Because the flow is defined by an isentropic region (flow that travels through the fan) and an anisentropic region (flow that travels through the oblique shock), a slip line results between the two flow regions.

==Applications==

===Supersonic wind tunnels===
Supersonic wind tunnels are used for testing and research in supersonic flows, approximately over the Mach number range of 1.2 to 5. The operating principle behind the wind tunnel is that a large pressure difference is maintained upstream to downstream, driving the flow.

Wind tunnels can be divided into two categories: continuous-operating and intermittent-operating wind tunnels. Continuous operating supersonic wind tunnels require an independent electrical power source that drastically increases with the size of the test section. Intermittent supersonic wind tunnels are less expensive in that they store electrical energy over an extended period of time, then discharge the energy over a series of brief tests. The difference between these two is analogous to the comparison between a battery and a capacitor.

Blowdown type supersonic wind tunnels offer high Reynolds number, a small storage tank, and readily available dry air. However, they cause a high pressure hazard, result in difficulty holding a constant stagnation pressure, and are noisy during operation.

Indraft supersonic wind tunnels are not associated with a pressure hazard, allow a constant stagnation pressure, and are relatively quiet. Unfortunately, they have a limited range for the Reynolds number of the flow and require a large vacuum tank.

There is no dispute that knowledge is gained through research and testing in supersonic wind tunnels; however, the facilities often require vast amounts of power to maintain the large pressure ratios needed for testing conditions. For example, Arnold Engineering Development Complex has the largest supersonic wind tunnel in the world and requires the power required to light a small city for operation. For this reason, large wind tunnels are becoming less common at universities.

===Supersonic aircraft inlets===
Perhaps the most common requirement for oblique shocks is in supersonic aircraft inlets for speeds greater than about Mach 2 (the F-16 has a maximum speed of Mach 2 but doesn&#x27;t need an oblique shock intake). One purpose of the inlet is to minimize losses across the shocks as the incoming supersonic air slows down to subsonic before it enters the turbojet engine. This is accomplished with one or more oblique shocks followed by a very weak normal shock, with an upstream Mach number usually less than 1.4. The airflow through the intake has to be managed correctly over a wide speed range from zero to its maximum supersonic speed. This is done by varying the position of the intake surfaces.

Although variable geometry is required to achieve acceptable performance from take-off to speeds exceeding Mach 2 there is no one method to achieve it. For example, for a maximum speed of about Mach 3, the XB-70 used rectangular inlets with adjustable ramps and the SR-71 used circular inlets with adjustable inlet cone.

<text>The Henry Draper Catalogue (HD) is an astronomical star catalogue published between 1918 and 1924, giving spectroscopic classifications for 225,300 stars; it was later expanded by the Henry Draper Extension (HDE), published between 1925 and 1936, which gave classifications for 46,850 more stars, and by the Henry Draper Extension Charts (HDEC), published from 1937 to 1949 in the form of charts, which gave classifications for 86,933 more stars. In all, 359,083 stars were classified as of August 2017.

The HD catalogue is named after Henry Draper, an amateur astronomer, and covers the entire sky almost completely down to an apparent photographic magnitude of about 9; the extensions added fainter stars in certain areas of the sky. The construction of the &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot; was part of a pioneering effort to classify stellar spectra, and its catalogue numbers are commonly used as a way of identifying stars.

==History==
The origin of the &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot; dates back to the earliest photographic studies of stellar spectra. Henry Draper made the first photograph of a star&#x27;s spectrum showing distinct spectral lines when he photographed Vega in 1872. He took over a hundred more photographs of stellar spectra before his death in 1882. In 1885, Edward Pickering began to supervise photographic spectroscopy at Harvard College Observatory, using the objective prism method. In 1886, Draper&#x27;s widow, Mary Anna Palmer Draper, became interested in Pickering&#x27;s research and agreed to fund it under the name Henry Draper Memorial. Pickering and his coworkers then began to take an objective-prism survey of the sky and to classify the resulting spectra.
A first result of this work was the &quot;Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra&quot;, published in 1890. This catalogue contained spectroscopic classifications for 10,351 stars, mostly north of declination −25°. Most of the classification was done by Williamina Fleming. The classification scheme used was to subdivide the previously used Secchi classes (I to IV) into more specific classes, given letters from A to N. Also, the letter O was used for stars whose spectra consisted mainly of bright lines, the letter P for planetary nebulae, and the letter Q for spectra not fitting into any of the classes A through P. No star of type N appeared in the catalogue, and the only star of type O was the Wolf–Rayet star HR 2583.

Antonia Maury and Pickering published a more detailed study of the spectra of bright stars in the northern hemisphere in 1897. Maury used classifications numbered from I to XXII; groups I to XX corresponded to subdivisions of the Draper Catalogue types B, A, F, G, K, and M, while XXI and XXII corresponded to the Draper Catalogue types N and O. She was the first to place B stars in their current position, prior to A stars, in the spectral classification.

In 1890, the Harvard College Observatory constructed an observation station in Arequipa, Peru in order to study the sky in the Southern Hemisphere, and a study of bright stars in the southern hemisphere was published by Annie Jump Cannon and Pickering in 1901. Cannon used the lettered types of the &quot;Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra&quot;, but dropped all letters except O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, used in that order, as well as P for planetary nebulae and Q for some peculiar spectra. She also used types such as B5A for stars halfway between types B and A, F2G for stars one-fifth of the way from F to G, and so forth.

Between 1910 and 1915, new discoveries increased interest in stellar classification, and work on the &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot; itself started in 1911. From 1912 to 1915, Cannon and her coworkers classified spectra at the rate of approximately 5,000 per month. The catalogue was published in 9 volumes of the &quot;Annals of Harvard College Observatory&quot; between 1918 and 1924. It contains rough positions, magnitudes, spectral classifications, and, where possible, cross-references to the Durchmusterung catalogs for 225,300 stars. The classification scheme used was similar to that used in Cannon&#x27;s 1901 work, except that types such as B, A, B5A, F2G, and so on, had been changed to B0, A0, B5, F2, and so on. As well as the classes O through M, P was used for nebulae and R and N for carbon stars.

Pickering died on February 3, 1919, leaving 6 volumes to be overseen by Cannon. Cannon found spectral classifications for 46,850 fainter stars in selected regions of the sky in the &quot;Henry Draper Extension&quot;, published in six parts between 1925 and 1936. She continued classifying stars until her death in 1941. Most of these classifications were published in 1949 in the &quot;Henry Draper Extension Charts&quot; (the first portion of these charts was published in 1937.) These charts also contained some classifications by Margaret Walton Mayall, who supervised the work after Cannon&#x27;s death.

The catalogue and its extensions were the first large-scale attempt to catalogue spectral types of stars, and its construction led to the Harvard classification scheme of stellar spectra which is still used today.

==Availability and usage==
Stars contained in the main portion of the catalogue are of medium magnitude, down to about 9m (about as bright as the faintest stars visible with the naked eye). The extensions contain stars as faint as the 11th magnitude selected from certain regions of the sky. Stars in the original catalogue are numbered from 1 to 225300 (prefix &quot;HD&quot;) and are numbered in order of increasing right ascension for the epoch 1900.0. Stars in the first extension are numbered from 225301 to 272150 (prefix &quot;HDE&quot;), and stars from the extension charts are numbered from 272151 to 359083 (prefix &quot;HDEC&quot;). However, as the numbering is continuous throughout the catalog and its extensions, the prefix &quot;HD&quot; may be used regardless as its use produces no ambiguity. Many stars are customarily identified by their HD numbers.

The &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot; and the &quot;Extension&quot; were available from the NASA Astronomical Data Center as part of their third CD-ROM of astronomical catalogues. Currently, the &quot;Catalogue&quot; and &quot;Extension&quot; are available from the VizieR service of the Centre de Données astronomiques (French for &quot;Astronomical Data Center&quot;) at Strasbourg as catalogue number III/135A. Because of their format, putting the &quot;Henry Draper Extension Charts&quot; into a machine-readable format was more difficult, but this task was eventually completed by 1995 by Nesterov, Röser and their coworkers, and the charts are now available at VizieR as catalogue number III/182.

<text>Vlaams Blok (, VB; ) was the name of a Belgian far-right and secessionist political party with an anti-immigration platform. Its ideologies embraced Flemish nationalism, calling for the independence of Flanders.

The party originated from split within the Volksunie (VU) party after the right-wing separatist and national conservative wing became disgruntled with the compromise of accepting Belgian federalism over Flemish interests, and what they saw as the VU&#x27;s move to the left. The former VU members created the Flemish National Party (VNP) and the Flemish People&#x27;s Party (VVP) which formed an electoral alliance called &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; in 1978, before merging to create Vlaams Blok as a political party in 1979. &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; was the most notable militant right wing of the Flemish movement and its track record in the Flemish and Belgian parliament elections was strong, making it one of the most successful nationalist parties in Western Europe and it ultimately surpassed the People&#x27;s Union in support. The party initially focused solely on the issues of Flemish autonomy and political freedom, which remained its core philosophy, but subsequently gained wider public support through broadening its campaigns to include immigration and law-and-order themes.

All significant Flemish political parties were reluctant to enter coalitions with the &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The court of appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled that some of the party&#x27;s organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot;. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being one of the most successful radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.

== History ==

===Background, Flemish Movement===

The &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; originated from the loose Flemish Movement, which historically has included an array of organisations seeking, to varying degrees, to promote Flanders. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Flemish nationalists operated within the established political parties, and had close ties with the political left. The early organised political expression of Flemish nationalism was triggered by World War I, and the introduction of universal suffrage and proportional representation in elections. The main party that initially represented the movement was the left-wing nationalist Front Party, founded by former soldiers and sympathizers from the trench wars in Flanders Fields disaffected with their French-speaking, often anti-Flemish, officers that had been unable to communicate with their troops. From the 1930s, the main party became the Flemish National Union which turned to collaborate with the Nazis during World War II, as they had promised them increased Flemish autonomy. These circumstances would compromise the re-emergence of Flemish nationalism after the war, although only a faction of the broader movement had actually pursued an agenda of collaboration.

The direct predecessor to the &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; was the big tent People&#x27;s Union, which was founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People&#x27;s Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The party had been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. The People&#x27;s Union had successfully united various strands of Flemish nationalists into a coherent movement from federalists to separatists, however some Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People&#x27;s Union since its outset, and it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party&#x27;s participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.

===Early years (1978–1988)===
In late 1977, the rejection of the Egmont pact by the hardliner faction of the People&#x27;s Union led to the establishment of two new (short-lived) parties; the radical nationalist Flemish National Party (VNP) and the national liberal Flemish People&#x27;s Party (VVP), respectively led by Karel Dillen and Lode Claes. The parties contested the 1978 general elections in a coalition called &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;, where they won 1.4% of the vote and one seat in the Chamber of Representatives (taken by Dillen). On 28 May 1979, the VNP and VVP finally merged to form a new party named Vlaams Blok, and Dillen was nominated to be the party&#x27;s leader for life. The party initially recruited its members from Flemish nationalist organisations, such as the &quot;Taal Aktie Komitee&quot;, &quot;Voorpost&quot;, &quot;Were Di&quot;, and the Order of Flemish Militants, while some local groups also simply turned into local branches of the Vlaams Blok. Since its inception, the party was widely regarded as an extreme right-wing and racist group. 

The party did not have much electoral success at first, and was stable at one seat in the 1981 general elections. It stood candidates in very few communities, and was active almost entirely in the city of Antwerp. Having been founded mainly as a protest against the Egmont pact, the party revamped and broadened its platform after the pact collapsed. It did not make much progress in the 1985 general elections, and Dillen thus started the so-called &quot;Operation Rejuvenation&quot;, allowing for an across-the-board change of the party leadership, integrating many leaders of nationalist youth and student organisations into the party council. The party&#x27;s youth organisation, the &quot;Vlaams Blok Jongeren&quot; (VBJ), was founded in 1987 by among others Filip Dewinter and Frank Vanhecke.

Starting in 1983, the Vlaams Blok increasingly began focusing on immigration (inspired by the success of other European right-wing populist parties), and on the international day against racism in 1984 held its first conference to discuss the &quot;foreigner problem.&quot; Towards the late 1980s, the party also became one of the first in Europe to flirt with an anti-Islam agenda (warning about what it called the &quot;Islamization of Europe&quot;) and address the issue of immigrants from majority Muslim societies, in particular Turkish and Moroccan migrant communities in Belgium. Vlaams Blok claimed that such communities were a threat to Flemish ethnic and cultural identity and were linked to crime. The same year, Dillen proposed a bill in the Chamber of Representatives to offer cash incentive for immigrants to return to their native country. In April 1987, a group around Roger Frankinouille of the only right-wing competitor to the Vlaams Blok, the anti-tax Respect for Labour and Democracy, switched to the party. The party campaigned for the 1987 general election with the slogan &quot;Own people first&quot; (&quot;Eigen volk eerst!&quot;, inspired by French National Front slogan &quot;The French first&quot;), and saw a slight victory, winning their first seat in Senate (taken by Dillen), and for the first time two seats in the Chamber (Dewinter and Annemans). The party&#x27;s shift towards focusing on immigration was however criticised by some Vlaams Blok members, and ultimately also led to the defection of some top party figures. The party nevertheless made a clear choice of focussing on the immigration issue, which had, and would, give results in elections.

===Rise of the party (1988–2004)===
The electoral success of the Vlaams Blok began after the younger generation in the party shifted the party&#x27;s emphasis from Flemish nationalism (separatism) to the immigration issue. In the 1988 local election in Antwerp the party first started to take off, going from 5.5% of the vote in the city to 17.7%, a success which drew much publicity. On 10 May 1989, based on the Antwerp success, the presidents of all major Belgian parties (including the People&#x27;s Union) signed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; (hygienic barrier), where the parties agreed to never conclude any political agreements with the Vlaams Blok, nor make immigration a political issue. While the Vlaams Blok itself also largely rejected cooperation with other parties, it did increasingly consider such cooperation, particularly in elections in 1994, 1999 and 2000, only to find themselves effectively blocked by the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. Although intended to keep the Vlaams Blok from gaining political influence, many argued that the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; in reality helped the strong electoral surge for the party, as it was made into what could be seen as the only &quot;true opposition,&quot; and the party was able to bolster its claims that the Belgian political establishment sought to suppress calls for more Flemish autonomy and deny the Flemish voters a voice in national affairs. The agreement was renewed in following years, and Vlaams Blok chairman Karel Dillen was used to call it the &quot;insurance policy&quot; of his party;

In December 1988, a major split occurred in the party, when a group who opposed the &quot;Operation Rejuvenation&quot; tried to squeeze the Dewinter-VBJ faction out of the party leadership. Led by Geert Wouters, he accused Dewinter&#x27;s faction of being &quot;Lepenists&quot;, and of attempting to sideline the Flemish question to rather favour the immigration question. Dillen however sided with Dewinter, and Wouters and his group left the party and founded the nationalist pressure group called the Nationalist Association-Dutch People&#x27;s Movement. In 1989, the party won a seat in the Brussels city council, as well as in the European Parliament. There, the Vlaams Blok agreed to form a parliamentary group together with the French National Front and the German The Republicans, called the Technical Group of the European Right. The group lacked an ideological coherence (stemming in part from Le Pen&#x27;s support for a Belgian state nationalism), and was largely organised on pragmatic grounds simply to get financial support.

In the 1991 general election, the Vlaams Blok for the first time surpassed the People&#x27;s Union, going from two to 12 seats in the Chamber, and from one to five seats in the Senate, in what was afterwards referred to by its opponents as &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. In the following years, the party saw a systematic upwards trend in all elections it participated in. In July 1992, the first Vlaams Blok motion was accepted in the Flemish Parliament, which rejected the right of francophone inhabitants in Flemish Brabant and Voeren to vote for Wallon institutions. In late 1992, it was announced that Neel, a popular Antwerp city councillor for 22 years for the Socialist Party went over to the Vlaams Blok, thereby causing the SP and CVP to lose their majority in the city council. In 1992, the party ideologue Filip Dewinter and chairman Karel Dillen established the party&#x27;s comprehensive immigration program, titled the 70-point plan. The plan sought to close the borders towards non-European immigrants, gradually repatriate those already in the country, and implement an &quot;own people first&quot; principle in all policy areas. Over the course of the 1990s, the party however increasingly distanced itself from the plan as it had alienated the party from gaining political influence, until it was finally officially discarded in 2000.
In the 1994 European election, the party doubled its seats (Dillen and Vanhecke) with 12.6% of the vote, but failed to continue a European Right group, due to other nationalist parties having dropped out of the parliament, or refusing to join a group. National Front and Vlaams Blok MEPs nevertheless established an &quot;alliance&quot; called The Coordination of the European Right. In 1996, party leader Karel Dillen, who had been nominated to hold his position for life, stepped down and personally appointed Frank Vanhecke as his successor. The choice of Vanhecke was seen a compromise between the Flemish nationalist wing around Annemans and the Lepenist wing around Dewinter, thus avoiding a potential internal struggle. In 1999, elections were scheduled for the European Parliament, the Chamber of Representatives and Senate and the Flemish Parliament, where the Vlaams Blok overtook the position as the third largest Flemish party, winning more than 15% of the vote in all elections, and a total of 45 seats in the various parliaments. The Vlaams Blok also benefitted from the further collapse of the People&#x27;s Union, which was brought on by the VU&#x27;s more national conservative members becoming disgruntled with the centre-left faction who had taken control of its leadership.

The Vlaams Blok continued to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% of the vote in the 2000 local elections. In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In 2002, the Vlaams Blok was the only party to vote unanimously against the introduction of same-sex marriage.

In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the &quot;formateur&quot; for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.

=== Court of Cassation ruling (2004) ===
In October 2000, the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, together with the Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium registered a complaint at the Correctional Court, in which they claimed that three non-profit organisations connected to the Vlaams Blok (its education and research office and the &quot;National Broadcasting Corporation&quot;) had violated the 1981 anti-racism law. The publications which were referred to included its 1999 election agenda and 1997 party platform. The challenged passages included those where the party called for a separate education system for foreign children, a special tax for employers employing non-European foreigners, and a restriction of unemployment benefits and child allowances for non-European foreigners.
In June 2001, the Brussels Correctional Court declared itself incompetent to hear the case, as it related to political misconduct. In February 2003, the Brussels Appellate Court followed and gave a similar judgement. The original plaintiffs then appealed, and the case was sent to the court of appeal in Ghent, which upheld the complaint; the Vlaams Blok non-profit organisations were fined, and it was deemed that the Vlaams Blok was an organisation that sanctioned discrimination. The Vlaams Blok lodged an appeal which was rejected, and in November 2004, the ruling was made definite, when it was upheld by the Court of Cassation. The ruling meant that the party would lose access to state funding and access to television, effectively shutting the party down.

====Reactions====
The whole trial was seen by some as a political trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party. The Vlaams Blok also pointed at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.

The leadership of the Vlaams Blok seized the occasion of the ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot; was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People&#x27;s Party and Flemish Freedom Front.) The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leadership made it clear that the party would fundamentally remain the same.

Professor Lamine (KUL), a former Vlaams Blok member and &quot;advisor&quot; of the party&#x27;s legal team, claimed that the party, for propaganda reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; &quot;For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn&#x27;t an option.&quot; Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; &quot;If we had gone to Strasbourg [ECHR] based on procedural arguments, we might have had a case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments. If &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot; were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow.&quot;

== Ideology ==
The main ideological and political strategies of the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People&#x27;s Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, later to be followed by focus on immigration and security, exploitation of corruption and other scandals, and defense of traditional values. While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of Flemish interests and desire for Flemish independence, its voters were mainly motivated by anti-immigration, law and order and anti-establishment protest.

===Flemish nationalism===
The main issue for the party was Flemish nationalism, and most issues that were added later, were in some way also connected to this. The Flemish nationalism promoted by the party (&quot;volksnationalisme&quot;) was according to its program &quot;based on the ethnic community being a naturally occurring entity whose cultural, material, ethical and intellectual interests need to be preserved.&quot; While the party primarily worked for an independent Flemish state (modeling the split on that of Czechoslovakia), it for a long time also promoted the idea that the new state should merge with the Netherlands, and establish a Dutch-speaking federation (Greater Netherlands). From the 1990s however, the latter idea was downplayed by the party, as the Netherlands then turned into a &quot;permissive, multicultural and social-democratic state&quot; according to one scholar (although this Dutch political situation would be sharply overturned in the 2000s).

===Immigration, minorities===
Immigration became an important issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Party founder Karel Dillen called for &quot;the return of the vast majority of non-European guest workers to their own homeland&quot; and argued for this to happen &quot;within a reasonable period.&quot; Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants were considered to be a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party&#x27;s opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration. 

Concerns about crime and security was also linked to immigration, as the party particularly blamed Turks and Moroccans for various criminal activity, and sought a zero tolerance approach regarding law and order. The party was also strongly anti-Islamic from early on, and in its 1993 program regarded Islam as &quot;a doctrine, which preaches holy war, assassination, forced conversions, oppression of women, slavery and extermination of &quot;infidels&quot;, [which] will automatically lead to what we now call fundamentalism.&quot; The party was anti-Muslim and portrayed Muslims as fifth column of a cruel and expansionist religion, and after the 1990 Gulf War called on the government to introduce measures to keep Belgium from being Islamised. Academic Hans-Georg Betz has described Vlaams Blok as one of the first radical European populist parties to pursue and gain support through an anti-Islamic agenda.

The party was according to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned by the party leadership. When Roeland Raes cast doubt on the scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.

===Social issues===
In 2003, the Vlaams Blok was the only major Flemish party to vote against the legalization of same-sex marriage in Belgium. The party was not opposed to homosexuality and supported civil partnerships for same-sex couples, but regarded same-sex marriage as a step too far.

===Anti-establishment===
Another element in the ideology of the party was a populist fight against the political establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.

===Economy===
The party had no strong economic preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy. While it supported privatisation and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported protectionism and defended the welfare state, especially if allocated to the native Flemish population.

===Foreign policy===
The party was the only major Belgian party that opposed Belgium&#x27;s membership of the European Union, as well as the idea of a federal Europe itself. It however defended a con-federal Europe based on sovereign culturally homogeneous nation-states. The European issue was however not an issue the party promoted much.

It also favoured the abolition of the United Nations, citing; &quot;The illogical composition of the Security Council. The unwieldy bureaucracy. The democratic deficit.&quot; The party did also not have any faith in such a world community or international legal system, questioning the entire logic behind the UN. It rejected the view of any international consensus about concepts as democracy, justice, freedom and human rights, especially since most of its member countries are non-Western and undemocratic.

==International relations==
The &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; maintained good contacts with nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot; did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party &#x27;86, the Centre Democrats and &quot;Voorpost&quot;, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations particularly with the French National Front, as well as the German People&#x27;s Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the &quot;Vlaams Blok&quot;.

The party also became very active in establishing contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which after a period of distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.

==Election results==
Note that the election results in elections other than those for the Flemish Parliament (and the Dutch-speaking electoral college in the European Parliament) gives a somewhat wrong image of the party&#x27;s support, given that the party only ran in Flanders, the one half of Belgium.

<text>Ticinum (the modern Pavia) was an ancient city of Gallia Transpadana, founded on the banks of the river of the same name (now the Ticino) a little way above its confluence with the Padus (Po).

It was said by Pliny the Elder to have been founded by the Laevi and Marici, two Ligurian tribes, while Ptolemy attributes it to the Insubres.
Its importance in Roman times was due to the extension of the Via Aemilia from Ariminum (Rimini) to the Padus (or Po) (187 BC), which it crossed at Placentia (Piacenza) and there forked, one branch going to Mediolanum (Milan) and the other to Ticinum, and thence to Laumellum where it divided once more, one branch going to Vercellae, and thence to Eporedia and Augusta Praetoria; and the other to Valentia, and thence to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin) or to Pollentia.
The branch to Eporedia must have been constructed before 100 BC. Ticinum is frequently mentioned by classical writers. It was a , but we learn little of it except that in the 4th century there was a manufacturer of bows and a mint there. The first Christian bishops of the city are identified as Juventius and Syrus.

In 271 the Emperor Aurelian defeated a retreating army of Juthungi at the Battle of Ticinum. Ticinum was the site of a mint, transferred from Mediolanum by Aurelian in 275, which remained active until closed by Constantine the Great in 326.

The city was pillaged by Attila in 452 and by Odoacer in 476, but rose to importance as a military centre in the Gothic period. At Dertona and here the grain stores of Liguria were placed, and Theodoric the Great constructed a palace, baths and amphitheatre and new town walls; while an inscription of Athalaric relating to repairs of seats in the amphitheatre is preserved (529). Boethius wrote &quot;De consolatione philosophiae&quot; while imprisoned at Ticinum before his execution in late 525 or early 526. From this point, too, navigation on the Padus seems to have begun. Narses recovered it for the Eastern Empire, but after a long siege, the garrison had to surrender to the Lombards in 572.

Saint Damian of Pavia was bishop of the city from 680 to 710.

The name &quot;Papia&quot;, from which the modern name &quot;Pavia&quot; comes, does not appear until Lombard times, when it became the seat of the Lombard kingdom, and as such one of the leading cities of Italy. Cornelius Nepos, the biographer, appears to have been a native of Ticinum. Of Roman remains little is preserved; there is, for example, no sufficient proof that the cathedral rests upon an ancient temple of Cybele though the regular ground plan of the central portion, a square of some 1150 yards, betrays its Roman origin, and it may have sprung from a military camp. This is not unnatural, for Pavia was never totally destroyed; even the fire of 1004 can only have damaged parts of the city, and the plan of Pavia remained as it was. Its gates were possibly preserved until early in the 8th century.

The picturesque covered bridge, the Ponte Coperto or Ponte Vecchio, which joins Pavia to the suburb on the right bank of the river, was preceded by a Roman bridge, of which only one pillar, in blocks of granite from the Baveno quarries, exists under the remains of the central arch of the medieval bridge, the rest having no doubt served as material for the latter. The medieval bridge dates from 1351 to 1354. It was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War and subsequently rebuilt in a similar shape and position.

<doc id="219151" wikidata="Q58903" url="?curid=219151" title="Highland cattle">
<text>The Highland is a Scottish breed of rustic cattle. It originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Western Islands of Scotland and has long horns and a long shaggy coat. It is a hardy breed, able to withstand the intemperate conditions in the region. The first herd-book dates from 1885; two types – a smaller island type, usually black, and a larger mainland type, usually dun – were registered as a single breed. It is reared primarily for beef, and has been exported to several other countries.

== History ==

The Highland is a traditional breed of western Scotland. There were two distinct types. The Kyloe, reared mainly in the Hebrides or Western Islands, was small and was frequently black. The cattle were so called because of the practice of swimming them across the narrow straits or kyles separating the islands from the mainland. The cattle of the mainland were somewhat larger, and very variable in colour; they were often brown or red.

These cattle were important to the Scottish economy of the eighteenth century. At markets such as those of Falkirk or Crieff, many were bought by drovers from England, who moved them south over the Pennines to be fattened for slaughter. In 1723 over Scottish cattle were sold into England.

A breed society was established in 1884, and in 1885 published the first volume of the herd-book. In this the two types were recorded without distinction as &#x27;Highland&#x27;.

In 2002 the number of registered breeding cows in the United Kingdom was about ; by 2012 this had risen to some . In 2021 it was ; the conservation status of the breed in the United Kingdom is listed in DAD-IS as endangered/at risk. The number of unregistered cattle is not known. 

Although a group of cattle is generally called a herd, a group of Highland cattle is known as a &quot;fold&quot;. This is because in winter, the cattle were kept in open shelters made of stone called folds to protect them from the weather at night. 

In 1954, Queen Elizabeth II ordered Highland cattle to be kept at Balmoral Castle where they are still kept today.

From the late nineteenth century, stock was exported to various countries of the world, among them Argentina, Australia, Canada, the Falkland Islands, the former Soviet Union and the United States. Later in the twentieth century there were exports to various European countries. In 2022 the breed was reported to DAD-IS by twenty-three countries, of which seventeen reported population data. The total population world-wide was reported at just over , with the largest numbers in France and Finland.

=== Australia ===

Scottish immigrants brought small numbers of the cattle to Australia from the mid-nineteenth century, but by the late 1800s none remained. Re-establishment of the breed began with an import of two cows and a bull from Scotland in 1954. The stock was later increased, mostly by breeding up using imported semen; some use was also made of embryo transfer. A breed society, the Australian Highland Cattle Society, was formed in 1988.

=== Canada ===
Highland cattle were first imported into Canada in the 1880s. The Hon. Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland cattle in Nova Scotia in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards the end of the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. In 2001 the population for Canada and the United States of America combined was estimated at .

=== Denmark ===

The Danish Highland Cattle Society was established in 1987 to promote the best practices for the breeding and care of Highland cattle and to promote the introduction of the breed into Denmark.

=== Finland ===

The Highland Cattle Club of Finland was founded in 1997. Their studbooks show importation of Highland cattle breeding stock to Finland, dating back to 1884. The Finnish club states that in 2016, there were Highland cattle in Finland.

=== United States ===

The first record of Highland cattle being imported to the United States was in the late 1890s. The American Highland Cattle Association was first organised in 1948 as the American Scotch Highland Breeders Association, and now claims approximately members.

== Characteristics ==

They have long, wide horns and long, wavy, woolly coats. The usual coat colour is reddish brown, seen in approximately 60% of the population; some 22% are yellow, and the remainder pale silver, black or brindle/dun. The coat colours are caused by alleles at the &quot;MC1R&quot; gene (E locus) and the &quot;PMEL&quot; or &quot;SILV&quot; gene (D locus).

They have an unusual double coat of hair. On the outside is the oily outer hair – the longest of any cattle breed – covering a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.

Mature bulls can weigh up to and heifers can weigh up to . Cows typically have a height of , and bulls are typically in the range of . Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.

== Cold tolerance==
All European cattle cope relatively well with low temperatures but Highland cattle have been described as &quot;almost as cold-tolerant as the arctic-dwelling caribou and reindeer&quot;. Conversely due to their thick coats they are much less tolerant of heat than zebu cattle, which originated in South Asia and are adapted for hot climates. Highland cattle have been successfully established in countries where winters are substantially colder than Scotland such as Norway and Canada.

==Social behaviour==
A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied over a period of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear structure and hierarchy of dominance, which reduces aggression. Social standing depends on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones, and males dominant to females. Young bulls will dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.

Breeding occurred in May and June, with heifers first giving birth at 2–3 years old.

== Use ==
The meat of Highland cattle tends to be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely insulated by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland.

=== Commercial success ===
The beef from Highland cattle is very tender, but the market for high-quality meat has declined. To address this decline, it is common practice to breed Highland &quot;suckler&quot; cows with a more favourable breed such as a Shorthorn or Limousin bull. This allows the Highland cattle to produce a crossbred beef calf that has the tender beef of its mother on a carcass shape of more commercial value at slaughter. These crossbred beef suckler cows inherit the hardiness, thrift and mothering capabilities of their Highland dams and the improved carcass configuration of their sires. Such crossbred sucklers can be further crossbred with a modern beef bull such as a Limousin or Charolais to produce high quality beef.

<text>Right Now! was a far-right British political magazine, which ran from 1993 to 2006. The magazine also featured arts coverage and cultural criticism. 

It was initially edited by Michael Harrison (an associate of Lady Birdwood), and then from 1995 until closure by Derek Turner. Contributing editors included Allan Robertson and Christopher Luke of the London Swinton Circle and Stuart Millson of the Conservative Democratic Alliance. Its origins lay in the Revolutionary Conservative Caucus and with right-wing members of the Monday Club.

It proclaimed itself a magazine of &quot;politics, ideas and culture&quot;. It featured interviews with and articles by figures including Antony Flew, Roger Scruton, Pat Buchanan, Peter Brimelow, Frederick Forsyth, Charles Moore, Garry Bushell, Nick Griffin, Jean-Marie Le Pen, Alain de Benoist, Richard Lynn, J. Philippe Rushton, Thomas Fleming, Samuel T. Francis and C. B. Liddell.

Prominent Conservative politicians who contributed to, or were interviewed by, &quot;Right Now!&quot; include Norman Tebbit, Ann Widdecombe, John Redwood, Teddy Taylor, Teresa Gorman and Bill Cash.

The magazine was mentioned by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in 2000 in an attack on then Conservative Party leader William Hague&#x27;s inability to contain &quot;extremists&quot; within the party; Cook criticised Hague for not shutting the magazine down.

Andrew Hunter, a former Conservative MP who defected to Ian Paisley&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party, was a long-time patron of the magazine. Hunter ceased links with the magazine in 2002, following pressure from Iain Duncan Smith, stating disagreement with an advert in the magazine for the Conservative Democratic Alliance which was critical of the Conservative Party.

<doc id="219157" wikidata="Q5163036" url="?curid=219157" title="Conservative Democratic Alliance">
<text>The Conservative Democratic Alliance (CDA) was a political pressure group from the United Kingdom. The CDA referred to itself as the &quot;authentic voice of conservatism&quot;. It closed in December 2008.

==Foundation and organisation==
The CDA was formed mostly by disaffected members of the Conservative Monday Club, another right-wing pressure group, who disagreed with the club&#x27;s response to the Conservative Party&#x27;s severing of links with the club in 2001. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the CDA as &quot;a hardline offshoot of the Monday Club&quot;.

The group was described as &quot;ultra-right&quot; by the Commission for Racial Equality.

The group&#x27;s chairman was Michael Keith Smith, commonly known as Mike Smith, who had been a member of the Conservative Monday Club since the early 1970s, and served on its Executive Council, 1986–1993.

Original members of the CDA&#x27;s steering committee included:
* Sam Swerling, a Conservative Party parliamentary candidate twice in 1974 and councillor (1978–82) on Westminster City Council.
* Stuart Millson, an independent councillor for East Malling and Larkfield Parish Council, and founder, with Jonathan Bowden, of the short-lived Revolutionary Conservative Caucus.
* Gregory Lauder-Frost, former Political Secretary, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman, of the Monday Club.

==Politics==
On 27 June 2002, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; carried a letter from the CDA, signed by Mike Smith, attacking the Conservative Party and its chairman Francis Maude for &quot;the sleaze, double-dealing, arrogance, incompetence, Europhilia, indifference and drift with which the party is still associated. &quot;Voters&quot;, he wrote, &quot;deserve a real alternative to Blairism and his &#x27;straight kinda guy&#x27; chicanery. Mr. Maude and his C-Changing Tories are incapable of providing it.&quot; (&quot;C-Change&quot; was a now-defunct Tory modernising pressure group headed by Maude.)

The CDA often criticised free-market economics and Americanisation in the United Kingdom, both of which it perceived to be after-effects of Thatcherism. That may be seen as distinguishing it from Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s Conservative Party leadership, which CDA members often criticised as neoconservative. The CDA was also fervently opposed to the European Union and to close links with the George W. Bush administration.

==Activities==
The CDA held what was described as &quot;a packed meeting of right-wingers&quot; in a hotel at the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth on 11 October 2002, chaired by Mike Smith, who accused Conservative Party Chief Whip David Maclean of gagging his party&#x27;s MPs over the EU, declaring him &quot;a disgrace to the party.&quot; The meeting was addressed by:
* Roger Knapman, then leader of the UK Independence Party;
* Ashley Mote, then a UKIP Member of the European Parliament and author of &quot;Overcrowded Britain – Our Immigration Crisis Exposed&quot; (2004);
* John Gouriet, a founder with Norris McWhirter of The Freedom Association;
* Derek Turner, editor of &quot;Right Now!&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; magazines;
* Sam Swerling, a consultant solicitor, Law Lecturer and former Monday Club chairman, who described Theresa May, MP, as &quot;a third-rate operator&quot;;
* Adrian Davies, then chairman of the Freedom Party, a barrister-at-law, who said &quot;the ideal candidate for the Conservatives now was a black, one-legged lesbian.&quot;

On 6 October 2004, the Conservative Democratic Alliance held another meeting as a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference, again in Bournemouth, in tribute to Enoch Powell.

The CDA planned to field its own candidates against Conservative MPs with small majorities at the 2005 General Election, concentrating on Oliver Letwin, the then Shadow Treasury Spokesman and MP for West Dorset, whom they described as &quot;simply not a Conservative at all&quot;.

In the event no candidates stood for the CDA at the 2005 General Election, and Letwin held his seat. However, CDA Chairman Michael Keith Smith stood as the UKIP candidate for Portsmouth North. Unsuccessful Tory candidate Penny Mordaunt and political commentator Richard North blamed Smith&#x27;s intervention for the Tories&#x27; failure to win back the seat.

The CDA&#x27;s June 2005 Summer Dinner in Fleet Street, London, was addressed by the &#x27;metric martyr&#x27;, Neil Herron, who led the campaign against the adoption of the metric system in the UK. The previous year Herron had stood as an independent candidate in European Elections for North East England, gaining almost 40,000 votes, over 5.1%.

The CDA produced a regular bulletin, and maintained a website with discussion forums (now defunct).

==Controversies==
An anti-Conservative Party advertisement for the CDA was published in &quot;Right Now!&quot;, containing the statement that the CDA was &quot;horrified by Tory frontbench spokesmen advocating gay lifestyles and New Labour ideas&quot;. Andrew Hunter MP withdrew his patronage from the magazine due to the appearance of the advert, saying that he was &#x27;appalled&#x27; by the &quot;antics&quot; of the CDA and that he no longer wanted to be associated with the magazine &quot;in any way&quot;.

Michael Keith Smith later described the advertisement, written by former CDA supporter Peter Gibbs, as &quot;regrettably homophobic&quot;. Smith branded the incident &quot;an untoward event&quot; and promised that CDA will take a more &quot;forward-looking and inclusive role in future&quot;.

In 2002, Iain Duncan Smith expelled CDA Chairman Mike Smith from the Conservative Party for threatening to stand candidates against Conservatives. Mike Smith issued a writ claiming Breach of Natural Justice and the party was obliged to re-admit him to membership. Soon afterwards, Smith resigned from the Conservative Party, and stood in the May 2005 general election as the UKIP parliamentary candidate for Portsmouth North, where the Labour victory was claimed by the Conservative candidate to be a result of the UKIP candidacy, a claim also made by Richard North of the Bruges Group.

During 2008 Mike Smith rapidly changed his stance and announced on the CDA&#x27;s forum that he had rejoined the Conservative Party: &quot;After wide-ranging initial doubts, Mike Smith has now enthusiastically accepted David Cameron&#x27;s reform agenda and returned to the Conservative Party from UKIP.&quot; As a result, the CDA Committee met in September 2008 and agreed that it would be best if the CDA were wound up. In December, Mike Smith announced on the CDA forums that the CDA would be disbanding as he himself had now come to support the Tories again and wanted to campaign for them in the run-up to the next UK general election. He circulated a letter to all members and supporters saying that the CDA would be effectively replaced by the Traditional Britain Group and urging their support.

Michael Keith Smith committed suicide at Portchester, Fareham in Hampshire, on 3 July 2010.

<text>The Conservative Monday Club (usually known as the Monday Club) was a British political pressure group, aligned with the Conservative Party, though no longer endorsed by it. It also had links to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland.

Founded in 1961, in reaction to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x27;s opposition to white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia, the club became embroiled in the decolonisation and immigration debate, inevitably highlighting the controversial issue of race, which has dominated its image ever since. The club was known for its fierce opposition to non-white immigration to Britain and its support for apartheid-era South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. By 1971, the club had 35 MPs, six of them ministers, and 35 peers, with membership (including branches) totaling about 10,000.

In 1982, the constitution was re-written, with more emphasis on support for the Conservative Party, but it remained autonomous from the party. In-fighting over the club&#x27;s traditional Tory agenda led to many resignations in 1991. In 2001, the Conservative Party formally severed relations with the club, which had ceased to exercise significant influence, with full membership below 600.

Following a vote of the Executive Council, the organisation was formally disbanded in July 2024.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The club was founded on 1 January 1961, by four young Conservative Party members, Paul Bristol (a 24-year-old shipbroker and the club&#x27;s first chairman, who left the club in 1968), Ian Greig (Membership Secretary until 1969), Cedric Gunnery (Treasurer until 1992; died 16 Mar 2023), and Anthony Maclaren. The club was formed &quot;to force local party associations to discuss and debate party policy&quot;. Its first general policy statement deplored the tendency of recent Conservative governments to adopt policies based upon expediency and demanded that instead Tory principles should be the guiding influence. It believed that the principles needing to be reasserted included the preservation of the constitution and existing institutions, the freedom of the individual, the private ownership of property, and the need for Britain to play a leading part in world affairs.

The club disliked what it regarded as the expediency, cynicism and materialism which motivated Harold Macmillan&#x27;s government. In addition it was concerned that during this period &quot;the left wing of the Party (had) gained a predominant influence over policy&quot; and that as a result the Conservative Party had shifted to the left, so that &quot;the floating voter could not detect, as he should, major differences between it and the Socialists&quot; and, furthermore, &quot;loyal Conservatives had become disillusioned and dispirited&quot;. The club&#x27;s published aims stated that it &quot;seeks to evolve a dynamic application of traditional Tory principles&quot;.

The group brought together supporters of Rhodesia and South Africa; the main impetus for the group&#x27;s formation was the Conservatives&#x27; new decolonisation policies, in particular as a general reaction to Macmillan&#x27;s &#x27;Wind of Change&#x27; speech made in South Africa. The club stated that Macmillan had &quot;turned the Party Left&quot;, and its first pamphlet opposed these policies as indicative of the Conservative Party&#x27;s move towards liberalism. The club is notable for having promoted a policy of voluntary, or assisted, repatriation for Commonwealth immigrants, a policy subsequently adopted in the 1970 Conservative Party manifesto.

The 5th Marquess of Salisbury (1893–1972), who had resigned from Macmillan&#x27;s Cabinet over the Prime Minister&#x27;s liberal direction, became its first president in January 1962, when he stated &quot;there was never a greater need for true conservatism than there is today&quot;. By the end of 1963 there were eleven Members of Parliament in the Club, which then had an overall membership of about 300. The club was courted by many Conservative politicians, including the Conservative Party leader Sir Alec Douglas-Home who was guest-of-honour at the club&#x27;s annual dinners of 1964 and 1969, and Enoch Powell, who, in a speech in 1968, said that &quot;it was due to the Monday Club that many are brought within the Conservative Party who might otherwise be estranged from it&quot;.

That year Alan Clark joined the club and was soon chairman of its Wiltshire branch. Under its chairman from 1964 to 1969, Paul Williams, who until 1964 had been MP for Sunderland South, the club enjoyed significant growth and influence. Some argued that the club had a disproportionate influence within Conservative circles, especially after six of its members who were MPs joined the Cabinet in 1970.

Harold Wilson, twice Labour Prime Minister, described the club as &quot;the guardian of the Tory conscience&quot;. Oxford political scholar Roger Griffin referred to the club as practicing an anti-socialist and elitist form of conservatism.

*Commander Anthony Courtney, former Conservative MP for Harrow East (1959–1966)

A number of other Monday Club members contested Labour-held seats, some of which had large majorities, and although the challenge was unsuccessful, their majorities were reduced. These included: Tim Keigwin, who almost unseated the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe at North Devon, Councillor John Pritchard of Bromley London Borough Council, who contested Wrexham and Norwood, and David Clarke, whose personal campaign assistant was the chairman of the club&#x27;s Young Members&#x27; Group, Christopher Horne, and who failed by only 76 votes at Watford.

By 1971, the club &quot;undoubtedly had the largest membership of any conservative group and included 55 different groups in universities and colleges, 35 Members of Parliament with six in the government, and 35 Peers&quot;. At the club&#x27;s Annual General Meeting on 26 April 1971, in Westminster Central Hall, the chairman, George Pole, announced that &quot;our membership, including national, branches and universities is around 10,000.&quot;

MP John Biggs-Davison, in his foreword to Robert Copping&#x27;s second book on the history of the club, stated that &quot;by its principles [the club] has kept alive true Tory beliefs and held within its ranks many who contemplated defecting from the Conservative and Unionist Party&quot;. The club&#x27;s chairman in June 1981, David Storey, described it as &quot;an anchor to a ship&quot;, referring to the Conservative Party.

===The Thatcher years===

The club&#x27;s revised constitution (21 May 1984) stated that &quot;the objects of the Club are to support the Conservative &amp; Unionist Party in those policies designed:
* to maintain loyalty to the Crown and to uphold the sovereignty of Parliament, the security of the realm, and defence of the nation against external aggression and internal subversion;
* to safeguard the liberty of the subject and integrity of the family in accordance with the customs, traditions, and character of the British people;
* to maintain the British constitution in obedience and respect for the laws of the land, freedom of worship and our national heritage;
* to promote an economy consistent with national aspirations and Tory ideals;
* to encourage members of the club to play an active part, at all levels, in the affairs of the Conservative and Unionist Party.&quot;
During the period that Margaret Thatcher led the Conservative Party, the Monday Club were prolific publishers of booklets, pamphlets, policy papers, an occasional newspaper, &quot;Right Ahead&quot;, and a magazine &quot;Monday World&quot; edited for some years by Sir Adrian FitzGerald, Bart., Sam Swerling, and later, Eleanor Dodd. In the October 1982 edition, MP Harvey Proctor called for the scrapping of the Commission for Racial Equality, Sir Patrick Wall commented on the Falklands War, James Molyneaux had an article &quot;What Future for Ulster&quot;, and Dr. Harvey Ward had an article on &quot;Zimbabwe Today&quot;. The September 1984 edition of &quot;Monday News&quot; carried the headline &quot;Kinnock Talks to Terrorists&quot;, quoting Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock&#x27;s declaration to the African National Congress&#x27;s Oliver Tambo that the ANC in South Africa could expect financial and material assistance from a future Labour government. Other attacks were made upon then-Greater London Council leader Ken Livingstone inviting Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to visit London in 1982.
An early member, in his &quot;Diaries&quot;, Alan Clark describes speaking later to a county-branch of the Monday Club in 1982: &quot;I really cannot bear the Monday Club. They are all mad, quite different from its heyday, when it was a right-wing pressure group at the time of Ted Heath&#x27;s Government. Now they are a prickly residue in the body politic, a nasty sort of gallstone.&quot;

The playwright David Edgar described the Monday Club, in 1986, as &quot;proselytis[ing] the ancient and venerable conservative traditions of paternalism, imperialism and racism.&quot;

===Old Guard departs===

In 1988–89, a group of longstanding members, led by Gregory Lauder-Frost, the club&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, succeeded in getting elected to the key posts on the Executive Council, with Dr. Mark Mayall as deputy chairman, and Lauder-Frost as the Political Secretary.
At the beginning of January 1991, the &quot;Monday Club News&quot; announced the abolition of the only salaried position, that of Director (then held by the club&#x27;s Treasurer, Cedric Gunnery, one of the club&#x27;s founders). Although this was due to the club&#x27;s precarious financial state, some felt more sinister moves afoot. Negative news stories began emerging and resignations followed. An internal investigation followed. The chairman, David Storey, lost an almost unanimous vote of no confidence on 17 January 1991, and his membership was terminated by the club&#x27;s Executive Council on 11 February on the grounds that &quot;he has engaged in behaviour prejudicial to the best interests, reputation, objects, and other members of the Monday Club; by abusing his position as Chairman in encouraging members to leave the Monday Club and to join a new political group&quot;. Dr. Mayall became Acting Chairman until the May AGM when he was confirmed in that post by election. By 1992, the new team had the national (as opposed to branches) membership over 1600 again.

Lauder-Frost&#x27;s resignation on 31 May 1992 saw the club descend into faction fighting and to a period of instability, with more departures and a resulting loss of membership and the club&#x27;s influence declined. Subsequent failed expulsion attempts resulted in huge legal bills, and when Dr. Mark Mayall&#x27;s term as chairman expired in April 1993 he left the group. Control passed effectively into the hands of Denis Walker, a former Methodist missionary, and later Minister for Education in the Rhodesian government. He changed the role of the club from a pressure group to a Conservative Party support group, bringing in a rule that all members must firstly be members of the party, something that prior to 1992 had been opposed.

==Organisation==

===Premises===
The national club established its offices at 51–53 Victoria Street, a few minutes&#x27; walk from the Palace of Westminster. The club was, however, always a pressure group, remaining separate from the Conservative Party organisation. Around 1980, the Victoria Street building was cleared for demolition, and the club moved its offices to 122 Newgate Street, London, EC1, opposite the Old Bailey. High rents forced another move to 4 Orlando Road, Clapham Common. In 1991 the club&#x27;s office was moved to an office belonging to W. Denis Walker, opposite Highams Park railway station in Waltham Forest, east London, with new telephone numbers, and a new Post Office Box number in central London. The newsletter stated that &quot;it is our long-term aim to relocate back to the very heart of London&quot;. Since then the club office has moved to the premises of other companies associated with Walker, at 65 Chapel Hill, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, CM23 3XR and Southmill Trading Centre, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, CM23 3DY, which according to Companies House is the current address as of Jan 2023.

===Branches===
In addition to the national club, which operated through an elected Executive Council and numerous policy groups or committees, there were semi-autonomous county branches, a Young Members Monday Club, and numerous university Monday Clubs, the most prominent and active being at the University of Oxford.

===Policy committees===
The Monday Club had various study groups (later renamed policy committees) including:
* Immigration and Repatriation: notable chairmen being George Kennedy Young ; Harvey Proctor MP; The Honourable Jonathan Guinness; John Bercow, later an MP and former Speaker of the House of Commons, was committee secretary 1981–82;
* Africa and Rhodesia: Harold Soref MP
* Home Affairs;
* Aviation;
* Economics: George Kennedy Young ; Geoffrey Baber, Piers Dixon MP
* Taxation: David Rowell, LL.B.
* Universities Group; Graham Webster-Gardiner, Richard Turnbull, Michael Clack
* Young Members Group; Christopher Horne, the Conservative Party candidate in both 1974 General Elections in the Manchester Central and Meriden Constituencies, Dr. Anna Bramwell, David Rowell, Eleanor Dodd, John R. Pinniger, AVR Smith, Rod Morris.
* Defence: The Honourable Archibald Hamilton MP; Major Sir Patrick Wall MP ; Commander Anthony Courtney MP ; Rear-Admiral Martin Wemyss 
* Foreign Affairs: Geoffrey Stewart-Smith MP; The Earl of Kimberley, John Carlisle MP and Gregory Lauder-Frost.

==Foreign affairs==
===Anti-communism===

The club was anti-communist and had an active Defence Committee chaired for over 15 years by Sir Patrick Wall MP MC and produced much literature on the perceived threat posed by Soviets and communists everywhere.

When it appeared that communism was failing in the Eastern Bloc, the club&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee in 1990 called upon Members of Parliament to be ready and to argue for the German borders to be restored to the position they stood at on 1 January 1938, saying there must be no gains for communism. By challenging the Oder-Neisse line, the club was arguing that Germany should take back all of the parts of Poland and the Soviet Union that been part of Germany in 1938, through what was to happen to the Poles living in such cites as Wrocław (formerly the German city of Breslau), Szczecin (formerly the German city of Stettin), and the Russians living in Kaliningrad (formerly the German city of Königsberg) was left unexplained.

Club officers, including Gregory Lauder-Frost, Denis Walker, and Lord Sudeley, attended a Western Goals Institute dinner in September 1989 in honour of Salvadorian president Alfredo Cristiani, whose military was at the time fighting the FMLN.

The club also took a hard line on the return of White Russians by the British Army to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Red Army in 1945–46, who executed nearly all of them. In this respect it gave its support to Count Nikolai Tolstoy, historian and author of &quot;Victims of Yalta&quot; and &quot;The Minister and the Massacres&quot;, who was then being sued for libel, by holding a dinner for him at London&#x27;s Charing Cross Hotel on 26 October 1988.

===Africa===

The club opposed what it described as the &quot;premature&quot; independence of Kenya, and the breakup of the Central African Federation, which was the subject of its first major public meeting in September 1961. It was fundamentally opposed to decolonisation, and defended white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia.

During the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) period in Rhodesia, the club strongly backed the White minority government of Ian Smith and the Rhodesian Front, being seen as its strongest supporters in Britain. In November 1963, the club had hosted a large reception for Smith at the Howard Hotel in London. That was followed the next year by receptions for Clifford Dupont and Moise Tshombe. The club continued its support for white minority rule in South Africa, with Lauder-Frost organising a large dinner in central London, on 5 June 1989, for its guest-of-honour Dr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party of South Africa, and his delegation. Tim Janman MP and the Lord Sudeley were amongst those present from Parliament.

===Croatia===

The government of Franjo Tuđman in Croatia invited the Monday Club to send a delegation to observe its conflict with Serbia, in October 1991, when the war for Croatian independence from the tottering Yugoslavia was at its height, with the armies of both sides engaged in serious fighting. The club delegation arrived just days after the Yugoslav Air Force bombing of the historic upper city in Zagreb. It was the first British political delegation to go to Croatia during the conflict.

===European Union===
Debate within the club was intense on the European Union. In the early days of the European Economic Community (EEC) one of the club&#x27;s MPs, Geoffrey Rippon, was so pro-EEC that he was known as &quot;Mr. Europe&quot;. Because of the divisions within the club on this issue the decision was taken not to have a policy on it. However, by 1980 the mood had changed. A club discussion paper in October 1980 was entitled &quot;Do Tories Really want to Scrap 80% of Britain&#x27;s Fishing Fleet&quot;, and the club adopted a firm anti-European Union (EU) position. Teddy Taylor, an anti-EEC MP, became chairman of the club&#x27;s EEC Affairs Policy Committee and authored a club policy paper in December 1982 entitled &quot;Proposals to Rescue the British Fishing Industry&quot;. The club&#x27;s Scottish branch&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Challenger&quot;, carried a further article against the EEC by Taylor in September 1985 entitled &quot;Swallowing the Nation&quot;.

Enoch Powell also spoke against the EEC at one of the Monday Club&#x27;s fringe meetings at the Conservative Party Conference at Blackpool on 8 October 1991, with Lauder-Frost presiding, which was filmed and broadcast on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; that night. In 1992, the chairman, Dr. Mark Mayall, authored another club booklet entitled: &quot;Maastricht: The High Tide of European Federalism&quot;, a fierce attack on the EEC.

==Immigration==
In September 1972, the club held a &quot;Halt Immigration Now!&quot; public meeting in Westminster Central Hall, opposite Parliament, at which the speakers Ronald Bell QC MP, John Biggs-Davison MP, Harold Soref MP, and John Heydon Stokes MP (all club members) called on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the Race Relations Act, (not the separate Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968), and start a full repatriation scheme. A resolution was drafted, approved by the meeting, and delivered to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who replied that &quot;the government had no intention of repealing the Race Relations Act&quot;. When Reginald Maudling resigned from the Cabinet, the Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe, commented that &quot;Mr. Heath has been left to wrestle with the Monday Club single-handed.&quot;

In October 1982, the Monday Club published a slightly revised, policy on immigration. It called for:
# Scrapping of the Commission for Racial Equality and Community Relations Councils.
# Repeal of the race relations laws.
# An end to the use of race or colour as criteria for the distribution of state benefits and loans.
# An end to positive discrimination.
# To bring an end to large-scale permanent immigration from the New Commonwealth.
# An improved repatriation scheme with generous resettlement grants for all those who wish to take advantage of them.

Although more explicit in detail, the general thrust of policy accorded with that found in the Conservative Party manifesto published ahead of the general election the following year.

The club&#x27;s position on immigration was reiterated in a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; from Lauder-Frost on the club&#x27;s behalf in October 1991, in which he stated that the annual levels of immigration &quot;were unacceptable&quot;.

==Northern Ireland==
Following an Official Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombing at Aldershot, Hampshire, in February 1972, club member and MP Jill Knight called for legislation to outlaw the Official IRA and its political wing, Sinn Féin (Official). The club was opposed to the dismantling of the Stormont government in Northern Ireland and the imposition of direct rule.

==Controversies and criticism==

&quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed back in 1968 that the organisation was &quot;probably the nearest British equivalent to the American John Birch Society&quot;. It was claimed by opponents that the National Front had started an active programme of entryism into the organisation, mainly via the growing number of regional branches. Throughout the early part of the 1970s the leadership stepped up its efforts considerably to try to address this issue. A new standardised set of rules and procedures were instituted which sought to institute a far greater level of centralised control over the growth and activity of the regional branches. There were a number of expulsions, and some branches were forced to disband.

On 24 February 1991, &quot;The Observer&quot; ran a lengthy article entitled &quot;Far Right takes over the Monday Club&quot;, stating that a number of senior members had tendered their resignations in protest at the club&#x27;s &quot;takeover&quot; by &quot;extreme right-wingers.&quot; The club&#x27;s solicitors, Rubenstein, Callingham &amp; Gale, sent a formal letter of protest to the editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; about the article, and demanded a right of reply for the club. The editor agreed and Lauder-Frost, writing on behalf of the club, subsequently challenged the article&#x27;s accusations in a Letter to the Editor, which was published the following Sunday. He denied that a takeover had occurred, said that none of the club&#x27;s policies had changed and that its direction was consistent with its aims and historical principles. Faction fighting within the club following Lauder-Frost&#x27;s departure at the end of May 1992 led to a period of instability and a resulting loss of membership. The club&#x27;s influence declined.

==Suspension of links by the Conservative Party (2001)==
After the defeats in the 1997 general election and 2001 general election, the Conservative Party began decisive moves towards becoming more centrist; the 2002–2003 party chairman and future Prime Minister, Theresa May, would later state that it had been perceived by voters as the &quot;Nasty Party&quot;. The then party leader, Iain Duncan Smith, suspended the Monday Club&#x27;s longstanding links with the party in October 2001, saying his party would have nothing to do with the organisation unless it stopped making &quot;distasteful&quot; remarks on race and immigration. 

Although the Monday Club was a completely autonomous pressure-group and not part of the Conservative Party organisation, Conservative Party chairman David Davis then informed the club&#x27;s National Executive that links between it and the party were being severed until it stopped promoting several of its (long-held and established) policies such as the voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities. Davis later told the media: &quot;I have told them that until a number of things are concluded—particularly some concerns about the membership of the club, and a review of the club&#x27;s constitution and a requirement that the club will not promulgate or discuss policies relating to race—the club is suspended from any association with the Conservative party&quot;. Three MPs, Andrew Hunter, Andrew Rosindell and Angela Watkinson, were ordered to resign from the club.

==The club&#x27;s later years==
From 1993, new full members of the club had to be members of the Conservative Party, though there was no such requirement for associate membership. Monday Club observers, such as Denis Walker, have attended Democratic Unionist Party conferences.

In 2002, the club was described as a &quot;bastion on the Tory hard right&quot; by BBC News Online. The club&#x27;s agenda stresses support for what it calls &quot;traditional Conservative values&quot;, including &quot;resistance to &#x27;political correctness.

On 10 May 2002, the BBC reported that the club sought to restore its links with the Conservative Party.

&quot;The Times&quot; reported on 2 June 2006 that, as the club &quot;is now slowly nudging back into the mainstream, many members feel that it is time to return to the fold&quot;. Having returned to being a much smaller organisation, the Club continues to lobby Parliamentarians, to publish comment pieces and an annual journal. It also organises occasional meetings and hosts dinners in London. Recent speakers have included Sir Christopher Chope MP, Michael Nazir-Ali, Andrew Rosindell MP, Arlene Foster and Ian Paisley Jr MP.

The group&#x27;s website listed its priorities as the maintenance of the monarchy and the Union; protecting the &quot;family unit&quot;; restoring law and order; opposition to Britain&#x27;s membership in the EU; promoting a &quot;sound economy&quot; and a &quot;robust defence capability&quot;; opposition to &quot;political correctness&quot; and maintaining traditional values.

With the emergence of groups such as Conservative Alliance for Britain and Popular Conservatives; the Club&#x27;s place as the flag bearer of the traditional right tendency had largely been superseded. For this reason, coupled with a declining membership and increasingly straightened finances, the Club&#x27;s Executive reluctantly came to the decision to disband the organisation in July 2024.

<text>Johan Halvorsen (15 March 1864 – 4 December 1935) was a Norwegian composer, conductor and violinist.

== Life ==
Born in Drammen, he was an accomplished violinist from a very early age and became a prominent figure in Norwegian musical life. He received his musical education in Kristiania (now Oslo) and Stockholm, and was a concertmaster in Bergen before joining the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was a concertmaster in Aberdeen, then a professor of music in Helsinki, and finally became a student once again, in St Petersburg, Leipzig (with Adolph Brodsky), Berlin (with Adolf Becker), and Liège (with César Thomson).

Returning to Norway in 1893, he worked as conductor of the theatre orchestra at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen and of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. He became concertmaster of the Bergen Philharmonic in 1885, and principal conductor in 1893. In 1899 he was appointed conductor of the orchestra at the newly opened National Theatre in Kristiania, a position he held for 30 years until his retirement in 1929.

As well as theatre music, Halvorsen conducted performances of over 30 operas and also wrote the incidental music for more than 30 plays. Following his retirement from the theatre he finally had time to concentrate on the composition of his three symphonies and two well-known Norwegian rhapsodies.

Halvorsen&#x27;s compositions were a development of the national romantic tradition exemplified by Edvard Grieg though written in a distinctive style marked by innovative orchestration. Halvorsen married Grieg&#x27;s niece, and orchestrated some of his piano works, such as a funeral march which was played at Grieg&#x27;s funeral. Five days after Halvorsen died, Grieg&#x27;s cousin and widow Nina Grieg also died.

His best known works today are the &quot;Bojarenes inntogsmarsj&quot; (&quot;Entry March of the Boyars&quot;) and &quot;Bergensiana&quot;, along with his Passacaglia and Sarabande, duos for violin and viola based on themes by George Frideric Handel.

In early 2016, librarians at the University of Toronto announced that they had located the manuscript score of his violin concerto, performed only three times in 1909 and considered lost. The piece received its fourth performance, 107 years later, in 2016.

<text>The home counties are the counties of England that surround London. The counties are not precisely defined but Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent and Surrey are usually included in definitions as they all border London. Other counties slightly further from London – such as Bedfordshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, East Sussex and West Sussex – are not always regarded as home counties, although on occasion may be thought of as such due to their proximity to London and their connection to the London regional economy.

==Origin==
The origin of the term &quot;home counties&quot; is uncertain. Marcus Crouch, writing in 1975, thought that it derived from the Home Counties Circuit of courts that had surrounded London since at least the 18th century. Looking further back, he suggested that it included the counties in which, since the Tudor period, it has been possible for civil servants and politicians to have their country homes and still be able to travel into London without excessive delay when they were needed.

== Composition ==
The earliest use of the term cited in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from 1695. Charles Davenant, in &quot;An Essay upon Ways and Means of Supplying the War&quot;, wrote, &quot;The Eleven Home Counties, which are thought in Land Taxes to pay more than their proportion, viz. &quot;Surry&quot; with &quot;Southwark&quot;, &quot;Hertfordshire&quot;, &quot;Bedfordshire&quot;, &quot;Cambridgeshire&quot;, &quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;Essex&quot;, &quot;Norfolk&quot;, and &quot;Suffolk&quot;, &quot;Berks&quot;, &quot;Bucks&quot;, and &quot;Oxfordshire&quot;.&quot;

Later definitions have tended to be more narrow and &quot;Bacon&#x27;s Large Scale Atlas of London and Suburbs&quot; (revised edition c. 1912) includes Berkshire, Buckingham, Essex, Hertford, Kent, Middlesex and Surrey in the &quot;maps of the home counties&quot;.

In reviewing S. P. B. Mais&#x27;s &quot;The Home Counties&quot; (Batsford The Face of Britain series, 1942), Norah Richardson noted that &quot;the home counties&quot; was a term in constant use but hard to define, but that Mais&#x27;s definition of &quot;the five counties around London County – Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent and Surrey&quot; could not be improved upon.

The term is sometimes understood to mean those counties which, on their borders closest to London, have been partly subsumed into London. Indeed, the former county of Middlesex has been almost wholly within London since 1965 as have parts of Kent, Hertfordshire and Surrey, although the county continues to exist as a cultural and historic entity.

The third edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (2010) defines the term as &quot;the English counties surrounding London, into which London has extended. They comprise chiefly Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Hertfordshire.&quot; Parts of all of those historic counties are, since 1965, officially within London, although no part of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire or Sussex is. The county of Sussex is also wholly outside, and Berkshire almost wholly outside, the route of the M25 motorway, which is often treated as an unofficial perimeter of Greater London, and some definitions mention that those counties are not always included amongst the home counties, or that the term has been extended to include them.

==Inhabitants==
The home counties have been characterised as being &quot;inhabited on the whole by &#x27;nice&#x27;, comfortable, and conformist middle-class people&quot; (1987) exemplified by the county of Surrey which has been described as possessing quintessential home counties characteristics of &quot;a comfortable plasticised commuterland with respectable villas and neatly mown lawns interspersed with patches of mild scenery&quot;. In fiction, the character of Margot Leadbetter in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot;, set in Surbiton, formerly in Surrey, has been described by &quot;The Spectator&quot; as &quot;a Home Counties Conservative to her fingertips&quot;.

Marcus Crouch, however, has made the point that the home counties have been more affected by migration from within and without the United Kingdom than any other region of the country, making them the most cosmopolitan region of England and meaning that there is no typical home counties inhabitant. One result of this diversity, he argues, is that local loyalties are shallower in the home counties than in, for instance, Yorkshire or parts of Scotland where there has been less population mobility.

==Geology==
Marcus Crouch has identified one of the principal characteristics of the home counties as being a shared chalk geology that is broadly mirrored north and south of the Thames.

==Economy==
The home counties are some of the wealthiest in Britain with the towns of Virginia Water, Esher and Weybridge, all in Surrey, ranked in one 2019 survey as having some of the highest average house prices in the country. However, a 2011 report described the perception that South East England, the official region of England in which most of the home counties are located, was universally wealthy as inaccurate and noted that 500,000 people in the region lived in areas that were within the 20% most deprived areas in the country with deprivation concentrated in coastal areas such as Margate (Kent) and Hastings (East Sussex). Significant areas of deprivation were also found in the urban areas of south Hampshire and Slough.

==In official use==

Multiple definitions of the term have been used in legislation and by official bodies. In the twentieth century, for instance, as follows: (the table includes all the areas mentioned above):
* 1908: The Home Counties Division of the Territorial Force comprised units recruiting in Middlesex, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.
* 1920: The London and Home Counties Electricity District consisted of the counties of London and Middlesex; and parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey.
*1924: The London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee, covering the London Traffic Area: London, Middlesex, and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, and Surrey.
*1926: The Home Counties (Music and Dancing) Licensing Act regulated activities in all parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey within 20 miles of the City of London or City of Westminster.
*1938: Green Belt (London and Home Counties) Act limited development in parts of Middlesex, Kent, Buckinghamshire, Surrey, Essex, Berkshire, and Hertfordshire.
*1948: The Home Counties Brigade was formed to administer the infantry regiments of the City and County of London, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, and Sussex.
*1995: The Valuation Office rating manual defined both inner and outer home counties, with the inner home counties being defined as inside the M25 motorway. The outer home counties included Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Bedfordshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire, Hampshire. Parts of Dorset and Cambridgeshire were included in the outer home counties with Bournemouth and Cambridge being home counties exclaves.

<doc id="219177" wikidata="Q1414298" url="?curid=219177" title="Social conservatism">
<text>Social conservatism is a political philosophy and a variety of conservatism which places emphasis on traditional social structures over social pluralism. Social conservatives organize in favor of duty, traditional values and social institutions, such as traditional family structures, gender roles, sexual relations, national patriotism, and religious traditions. Social conservatism is usually skeptical of social change, instead tending to support the status quo concerning social issues.

Social conservatives also value the rights of religious institutions to participate in the public sphere, thus often supporting government-religious endorsement and opposing state atheism, and in some cases opposing secularism.

Social conservatism, as a movement, is largely an outgrowth of traditionalist conservatism. The key difference is that traditional conservatism is broader and includes philosophical considerations, whereas social conservatism is largely focused on just moralism.

== Social conservatism and other ideological views ==
There is overlap between social conservatism and paleoconservatism, in that they both support and value traditional social forms.

Social conservatism is not to be confused with economically interventionist conservatism, where conservative ideas are combined with Keynesian economics and a welfare state as practised by some European conservatives (e.g. one-nation conservatives in the United Kingdom, Gaullists in France). Some social conservatives support free trade and laissez faire market approaches to economic and fiscal issues, but social conservatives may also support economic intervention where the intervention serves moral or cultural aims. Historian Jon Wiener has described social conservatism as historically the result of an appeal from &quot;elitist preservationists&quot; to lower-class workers to &#x27;protect&#x27; wealth from immigration.

Many social conservatives support a balance between protectionism and a free market. This concern for material welfare, like advocacy of traditional mores, will often have a basis in religion. Examples include the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, the Family First Party and Katter&#x27;s Australian Party, and the communitarian movement in the United States.

== Social conservatism by country ==
=== Australia ===

Mainstream conservatism in Australia generally incorporates liberalism, hence liberal conservatism being the primary ideology of the major centre-right coalition in Australia, the Liberal-National Coalition. Therefore, the Coalition, while having members with some socially conservative views, is not considered socially conservative. However, both social conservatism and right-wing populism are present among right-wing minor parties, such as Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation, the United Australia Party (UAP) and Katter&#x27;s Australian Party (KAP) amongst others.

Nevertheless, the National Right (also known as the &quot;Conservative&quot; faction or the &quot;Right&quot; faction) serves as the party&#x27;s social conservative faction, although the party is still considered a broad church conservative party and factions do collaborate with each other; for example, the New South Wales Liberal Party often chooses a leadership team consisting of both a member of the more centrist Moderate faction and a member of the Right.

Social conservatives in Australia often need to take a broad church stance while governing. For example, former New South Wales Liberal Party leader and state premier, Dominic Perrottet, a conservative Catholic, despite having voted against legalising same-sex marriage in 2018 and opposing abortion, followed Labor leader Chris Minns&#x27; in supporting a 2023 state-wide ban on gay conversion therapy, whilst also vowing to protect religious freedom and preaching.

During the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey of 2018, which successfully sought to legalise same-sex marriage in Australia, the Coalition government led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull allowed its members a conscience vote on the issue. While many (including Turnbull) were in favour, some were opposed, but supported holding a plebiscite on the matter. Federal Coalition MPs who opposed same-sex marriage during the debate included former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Peter Dutton, Scott Morrison and many others. However, when the plebiscite was successful (with 61.6% in favour), a vote needed to be held in both chambers of Parliament. The &quot;Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017&quot; was tabled in the Senate and was subsequently passed in the House of Representatives, with just three votes against (excluding the members who abstained). Due to their respective electorates delivering a majority &quot;yes&quot; vote (as well as the entire country), members such as Dutton (who voted &quot;no&quot; in the plebiscite) voted in favour of the bill after his seat of Dickson voted 65.16% in favour.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, social conservatism, though widespread, is not as prominent in the public sphere as in the United States. It is prevalent in all areas of the country but is seen as being more prominent in rural areas. It is also a significant influence on the ideological and political culture of the western provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.

Compared to social conservatism in the United States, social conservatism has not been as influential in Canada. The main reason is that the neoconservative style of politics as promoted by leaders such as former Prime Ministers such as Paul Martin and Stephen Harper have focused on fiscal conservatism, with little or no emphasis on moral or social conservatism. Without a specific, large political party behind them, social conservatives have divided their votes and can be found in all political parties.

Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called &quot;Red Tories&quot; for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada. Despite the Reform Party being dominated by social conservatives, leader Preston Manning, seeking greater national support for the party, was reluctant for the party to wholly embrace socially conservative values. This led to his deposition as leader of the party (now called Canadian Alliance) in favor of social conservative Stockwell Day. The party&#x27;s successor, the Conservative Party of Canada, despite having a number of socially conservative members and cabinet ministers, has chosen so far not to focus on socially conservative issues in its platform. This was most recently exemplified on two occasions in 2012 when the current Conservative Party of Canada declared they had no intention to repeal same-sex marriage or abortion laws.

=== China ===
Chiang Kai-shek, a former president of Republic of China, could be seen as a social conservative who was critical of liberal values and defended the union of Confucian traditions and modernism. Under his rule, the Kuomintang led the New Life Movement.

After the Chinese Communist Revolution, social conservatism in China increased due to the rise of New Confucianism and others after the 1970s to 1980s during the Chinese economic reform.

Bloomberg News described the period of China, where Xi Jinping is president, as &quot;Conservative Era&quot;; Faced with a shrinking population, China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong has urged women to cultivate a “culture” of childbirth and take on a more domestic role. CCP general secretary Xi has adopted a more conservative social view since he began his third leadership in 2022. He reflects traditional and patriarchal views of women in speeches and policies. This is related to China&#x27;s low birth rate problem.

===Islamic world===

Most Muslim countries are somewhat more socially conservative (such as Tajikistan and Malaysia) than neighbouring countries that are not Muslim. However, due to their interpretation of Islamic law also known as Shariah, they have some differences from social conservatism as understood in the nations of West Europe, North America and Oceania.

==== Arab world ====

The Arab world has recently been more conservative in social and moral issues due to the Arab spring.

===India===
==== Hindu social conservatism ====

Hindu social conservatism in India in the twenty first century has developed into an influential movement, represented in the political arena by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Hindu social conservatism, also known as the Hindutva movement, is spearheaded by the voluntary non-governmental organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The core philosophy of this ideology is nativism, and it sees Hinduism as a national identity, rather than a religious one. Due to an inclination towards nativism, much of its platform is based on the belief that Islamic and Christian denominations in India are the result of occupations, and, therefore, these groups should be uprooted from the Indian subcontinent by converting their members back to Hinduism.

In terms of political positions, Hindu social conservatives in India seek to institutionalize a Uniform Civil Code (which is also a directive under Article 44 of the Constitution of India) for members of all religions, over the current scheme of different personal laws for different religions. For instance, polygamy is legal for Muslims in India, but not Hindus.

==== Muslim social conservatism ====

There are several socially conservative Muslim organisations in India, ranging from groups such as the Indian Union Muslim League which aim to promote the preservation of Indian Muslim culture as a part of the nation&#x27;s identity and history.

=== South Africa ===

Social conservatism had an important place in Apartheid South Africa ruled by the National Party. Pornography, gambling and other activities that were deemed undesirable were severely restricted. The majority of businesses were forbidden from doing business on Sunday.

=== United States ===
Social conservatism in the United States is a right-wing political ideology that opposes social progressivism. It is centered on the preservation of what adherents often call &#x27;traditional&#x27; or &#x27;family values&#x27;, though the accepted aims of the movement often vary amongst the organisations it comprises, making it hard to generalise about ideological preferences. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as opposition to abortion and opposition to same-sex marriage. Sociologist Harry F. Dahms suggests that Christian doctrinal conservatives (anti-abortion, anti-same-sex marriage) and gun-use conservatives (such as supporters and members of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA)) form two domains of ideology within American social conservatism.

The Republican Party is the largest United States political party with socially conservative ideals incorporated into its platform. Other socially conservative parties include the American Solidarity Party, the Constitution Party and the Prohibition Party.

Social conservatives are strongest in the South, where they are a mainstream political force with aspirations to translate those ideals using the party platform nationally. Supporters of social conservatism played a major role in the political coalitions of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

===Other areas===
There are also social conservative movements in many other parts of the world, such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Europe, Mediterranean countries, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.

<text>The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is a species of crow associated with wetland habitats in the eastern and southeastern United States.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The fish crow was given its binomial name by the Scottish ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1812, in the fifth volume of his &quot;American Ornithology&quot;. The binomial is from Latin; &quot;Corvus&quot; means &quot;raven&quot;, while &quot;ossifragus&quot; means &quot;bone-breaker&quot;. It is derived from &quot;os&quot; or &quot;ossis&quot;, meaning &quot;bone&quot;, and &quot;frangere&quot;, meaning &quot;to break&quot;. The English-language common name &quot;fish crow&quot; also derives from Wilson, who ascribed the name to the crow&#x27;s aquatic diet, as described to him by local fishermen. He distinguished the fish crow from John Bartram&#x27;s &quot;great seaside crow&quot; by the former&#x27;s diminutive size when compared to the American crow.

The fish crow&#x27;s taxonomic relation to other species of the &quot;Corvus&quot; genus is still poorly understood, but DNA sequencing indicates that it is most closely related to the palm crow (&quot;C. palmarum&quot;) and the Jamaican crow (&quot;C. jamaicensis&quot;), with the three species forming a Nearctic clade. The Sinaloa crow (&quot;C. sinaloae&quot;) and Tamaulipas crow (&quot;C. imparatus&quot;) bear morphological similarities to and were once considered conspecific subspecies of the fish crow, but have since been recognized as distinct species.

==Description==

The fish crow is a small bird, with an average adult weight of in males and in females. The average male wingspan is similarly larger at , compared to in females. The total body length is between .

The fish crow is superficially similar to the American crow, but is smaller and has a silkier, smoother plumage by comparison. The upperparts have a blue or blue-green sheen, while the underparts have a more greenish tint to the black. The eyes are dark brown. The differences are often only really apparent between the two species when seen side by side or when heard calling. The bill is usually somewhat slimmer than the American crow, but is only readily distinguishable if both species are seen together.

Visual differentiation from the American crow is extremely difficult and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.

The voice is the most outwardly differing characteristic for this species and other American crow species. The call of the fish crow has been described as a nasal &quot;ark-ark-ark&quot; or a begging &quot;waw-waw&quot;. Birders often distinguish the two species (in areas where their range overlaps) with the mnemonic aid &quot;Just ask him if he is an American crow. If he says &quot;no&quot;, he is a fish crow.&quot; referring to the fact that the most common call of the American crow is a distinct &quot;caw caw&quot;, while that of the fish crow is a nasal &quot;nyuh unh&quot;. The fish crow also has a single call sounding like &quot;cahrrr&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species occurs on the eastern seaboard of the United States from Rhode Island south to Key West, and west along the northern coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. Coastal marshes and beaches, rivers, inland lakes and marshes, river banks, and the land immediately surrounding all are frequented. Fish crows are also found along many river systems inland for quite some distance, having expanded their range along rivers since the early 1900s. Since 2012, fish crows have rapidly expanded into Canada, with breeding populations along Lake Ontario.

==Behavior==
===Diet===

Food is taken mainly from the ground or shallow water where the bird hovers and plucks food items out of the water with its feet. The fish crow is omnivorous. It feeds on small crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimps, other invertebrates, stranded fish, and live fish if the situation favors their capture, eggs and nestlings of birds, small reptiles, the fruits of many trees, peanuts, and grains, as well as human scraps where available.

===Breeding===
The nest is usually built high in a tree and is often accompanied in nearby trees with other nests of the same species forming small, loose colonies. Usually, four or five eggs are laid. Pale blue-green in colour, they bear blotches of olive-brown. Fish crows build a new nest for each breeding attempt. A pair of fish crows were reported to have raised a young blue jay for multiple weeks.

==Conservation==
This species appears to be somewhat more resistant to West Nile virus than the American crow. Survival rates of up to 45% have been reported for fish crows, compared with near zero for American crows.

<text>Gerhard Schröder (11 September 1910 – 31 December 1989) was a West German politician and member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. He served as Federal Minister of the Interior from 1953 to 1961, as Foreign Minister from 1961 to 1966, and as Minister of Defence from 1966 until 1969. In the 1969 election he ran for President of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) but was outpolled by Gustav Heinemann.

==Life==
The son of a railway official, Schröder was born in Saarbrücken, then part of the Prussian Rhine Province. Having passed his Abitur exams, he went on to study law at the University of Königsberg and two semesters abroad at the University of Edinburgh, where he, according to his own accounts, became familiar with a British way of life. In 1932 he finished his studies in Bonn he had committed himself to the university group of the national liberal German People&#x27;s Party.

Schröder passed the first and second &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; in 1932 and 1936. Having obtained his doctorate in 1934 he worked as a consultant at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society in Berlin. Still as a referendary in Bonn, he had joined the Nazi Party on 1 April 1933 and also the &quot;SA&quot;. He continued his career as a law firm employee and in 1939 obtained an attorney&#x27;s certificate and worked as a tax lawyer. He left the NSDAP in May 1941 (a rather rare occurrence). In the same month and perhaps in connection, he married his wife, Brigitte Schröder née Landsberg, needing - she was half-Jewish - with an extraordinary permission by his Armed Forces superiors.

He held federal office as Minister of the Interior (1953–1961) and as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1961–1966) in the cabinets of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and of Ludwig Erhard. From 1966 to 1969 he served as Minister of Defence under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger.

In 1969 Gerhard Schröder ran for the Office of the Federal President (supported by CDU and NPD), but he was beaten by Gustav Heinemann, the nominee of the SPD (supported by FDP), at the third ballot with 49.4% to 48.8% of the votes of the Federal Assembly.

In the years following his active political activity, Schröder maintained a private discussion circle of former politicians, diplomats and economic officials who philosophized about the global problems of the new era but no longer intervened politically in day-to-day business. He supported the Reagan administration and endorsed the SDI program.

His last appearance in the Bundestag was on 17 June 1984, when he held the ceremonial address of the commemoration ceremony of the June 1953 bloody uprising.

Schröder died on 31 December 1989 in his house on Sylt. After his death, the German Bundestag honored him on 12 January 1990 with a state act in the plenary hall. Gerhard Schröder was buried in the cemetery of the island church of St. Severin in Keitum, Sylt.

<text>Saarpfalz (&quot;Saar-Palatinate&quot;) is a Kreis (district) in the south-east of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Saarbrücken, Neunkirchen, Kusel, Kaiserslautern, Südwestpfalz, district-free Zweibrücken, and the French &quot;département&quot; Moselle.

==History==
After the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar basin was placed under the administration of the League of Nations for 15 years. The Palatinate area, then part of Bavaria, was therefore split in two parts. The part which went into the Saar became commonly known as Saarpfalz, and was administered by the two &quot;Bezirksamt&quot; St. Ingbert and Homburg. The Saarpfalz district was created in 1974 when the St. Ingbert and Homburg districts were merged. Since 1997 the district has had a partnership with Henrico County, Virginia.
==Coat of arms==
The lion in the top left is the symbol of the Palatinate (Pfalz), the cross in the top right is the symbol of Trier, both owned a large part of the district in the past. The crosier is the bottom left represents the clerical possessions of the monasteries, while the silver lion in the bottom right is the symbol of the county of Homburg.

<text>The altar rail (also known as a communion rail or chancel rail) is a low barrier, sometimes ornate and usually made of stone, wood or metal in some combination, delimiting the chancel or the sanctuary and altar in a church, from the nave and other parts that contain the congregation. Often, a central gate or gap divides the line into two parts. Rails are a very common, but not universal, feature of Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches. They are usually about high, with a padded step at the bottom, and designed so that the wider top of the rail can support the forearms or elbows of a kneeling person.

The altar rail is a modest substitute for earlier barriers demarcating the chancel, the area containing the altar, which was reserved, with greatly varying degrees of strictness, for officiating clergy, including boys as choristers and altar servers. Although it only emerged after the Protestant Reformation, it has been found convenient by both Roman Catholic and more traditional Protestant churches, such as the Anglican, Lutheran and Methodist churches, although it is disliked by many Reformed and nondenominational churches.

==History==
Barriers of various kinds often mark off as especially sacred the area of a church close to the altar, which is largely reserved for ordained clergy. The Temple in Jerusalem contained a barrier of this kind, which separated the Courtyard of the Israelites from the Courtyard of the Priests. The templon was typical for the Late Antique period. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, curtains are still drawn to cut off that area during the holiest moments of the liturgy. In Eastern Orthodox and related rites, this evolved into a solid, icon-clad screen, called the iconostasis, that has three doorways which usually have doors and curtains that can be closed or drawn aside at various times.
Barriers demarcating the chancel, such as the rood screen, became increasing elaborate. They were largely swept away after both the Protestant Reformation and then the Counter-Reformation prioritized the congregation having a good view of what was happening in the chancel. Now the low communion rail is generally the only barrier. Despite being essentially a Counter-Reformation invention, this has proved useful and accepted in the Protestant churches that dispense communion. The screen enjoyed a small revival in the 19th century, after the passionate urgings of Augustus Pugin, who wrote &quot;A Treatise on Chancel Screens and Rood Lofts&quot;, and others.

There were medieval structures like communion rails, but the various types of screen were much more common. A church in Hasle, Bornholm claims to have &quot;a rare 15th-century altar rail&quot;; perhaps, like other examples, this is in fact a sawn-off medieval screen. The origin of the modern form has been described by one historian as &quot;nebulous&quot;, but it probably emerged from Italy in the 16th century. The German Lutherans and the Church of England were not far behind in adopting it, perhaps without being aware of the Italian versions. In England the rail became one of the focuses of tussles between the High Church and Low Church factions, and in many churches they were added, removed and re-added at different times.

Archbishop Laud was a strong supporter of rails, but the common story that he introduced them to England is incorrect; he was trying to prevent Puritan clergy from continuing to remove them, and his pressure in favour of rails was bound up with his very controversial &quot;altar policy&quot;, reasserting the placement of the altar in its medieval position. Matthew Wren, Laudian Bishop of Ely, was imprisoned during the whole of the English Commonwealth. Wren defended himself against charges of enforcing altar rails, which he pointed out had been found in many English churches &quot;time out of mind&quot;. 

In both Catholic churches and Anglican ones following Laudian instructions, the congregation was now asked to come up to the rails and receive communion kneeling at them, replacing a variety of earlier habits. This too was controversial in England, and the Laudian party did not push too hard for this in many dioceses.

In many of the parishes of the Lutheran Churches and the Methodist Churches, the use of altar rails have remained more common. There is typically no specific regulation concerning their presence or use, although they remain a common feature even in newly constructed churches. Their continued popularity results from a preference on the part of many to assume a posture of kneeling to receive the Eucharist. For those sanctuaries without an altar rail, in some cases a portable rail with attached kneeler is used for those who wish to kneel to receive the Eucharist.

==Catholic Church==

Newly constructed Catholic churches rarely have altar rails, which were once common in parish churches, those of the late nineteenth century being particularly decorative. Communicants knelt at the railings to receive the Eucharist by a priest. After the Second Vatican Council, many parishes removed their altar rails, and an unfounded idea arose that the council or the Holy See had ordered the change. 
Some Catholics and many architects and planners criticised some removals, often on liturgical, historical and aesthetic grounds. While in some states, the Roman Catholic Church has adopted a minimalist approach towards the removal of altar rails; in other countries, for example in Ireland, almost every re-ordering eliminated altar rails. Many Catholics resisted the changes: some took legal action to try to prevent the removal of altar rails and of other traditional features in pre-Vatican II sanctuaries.

Not all Catholics supported the changes to sanctuaries. Some disputed the belief that the altar rails were a barrier, claiming that many churches were able to allow full participation by the laity in the Ordinary form without removing altar rails. In recent times, a number of restorations of historic churches have re-introduced altar rails, since the idea that Vatican II required their removal is a misconception.

The &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot; states explicitly that the sanctuary &quot;should be appropriately marked off from the body of the church either by its being somewhat elevated or by a particular structure and ornamentation&quot;.
==Lutheran churches==


Within Lutheranism, the altar rail is the common place for a pastor to hear a confession, confession being generally required to receive the Eucharist for the first time.

==Methodist churches==
In many Methodist churches, communicants receive holy communion at the chancel rails, devoutly kneeling. The rite of confirmation, as well as the imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday takes place at the chancel rail in many Methodist parishes. The chancel rail also serves as the place where many individuals go, during the part of the Methodist liturgy called the &quot;Altar Call&quot; or &quot;An Invitation to Christian Discipleship&quot;, to experience the New Birth. 

Some people who have already had the New Birth go to the chancel rails to receive entire sanctification. Others go there repent of their sins, as well as pray. During this time, a Methodist minister attends to each person at the chancel rail, offering spiritual counsel.

<doc id="219196" wikidata="Q6788257" url="?curid=219196" title="Matt's Scooter">
<text>Matt&#x27;s Scooter (1985 – June 30, 2014) was a Standardbred pacer and sire who was named Harness Horse of the Year in 1989. Matt&#x27;s Scooter competed as a pacer in harness racing, winning the Meadowlands Pace, Prix d&#x27;Été, Confederation Cup, Messenger Stakes, American National Stakes, Breeders Crown, Driscoll Series, Mohawk Gold Cup, he was named Pacer of the Year in 1988 and 1989, and Harness Horse of the Year in 1989 by the United States Harness Association.

==Background==
Matt&#x27;s Scooter was a bay ridgeling bred by Max Gerson of New York. He was sired by Direct Scooter out of Ellen&#x27;s Glory by Meadow Skipper. As a yearling, he was bought for $17,500 by Gordon and Illa Rumpel of Calgary, and Charles Juravinski. He was trained by Harry Poulton at his base near Lake Scugog, Ontario.

==Racing career==
As two-year-old, Matt&#x27;s Scooter was given a relatively light campaign winning three of his nine races. He was not an easy horse to handle: Poulton described him as &quot;always bucking, kicking or doing something... he wanted to do everything 100 miles an hour&quot;.

In 1988, despite being ineligible for the Cane Pace and the Little Brown Jug, Matt&#x27;s Scooter earned $1.78 million winning eleven of his twenty two races. His major victories included the Meadowlands Pace and the Messenger Stakes.

In Autumn 1988, he paced a mile in 1:48.2 at the Red Mile in Lexington, Kentucky, lowering the world record previously held by Niatross, by four-fifths of a second.

As a four-year-old he won 23 of his thirty races and earned $1.14 million.

==Honors and awards==
Matt&#x27;s Scooter was named Pacer of the Year and best three-year-old in 1988. In the following year, he was again named best pacer and was awarded the title of Harness Horse of the Year. Matt&#x27;s Scooter was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and the United States Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Retirement and stud career==
He was retired from racing after 4 years, and stood as a breeding stallion for Perretti Farms in Cream Ridge, New Jersey. He was pensioned from stud duty in 2011. Bob Marks of Perretti Farms said &quot;His libido is willing, but with his hind suspensory, we&#x27;re afraid he could hurt himself&quot;.

Matt&#x27;s Scooter was euthanised at Mid-Atlantic Equine Clinic in Ringoes, New Jersey on June 30, 2014.

<doc id="219198" wikidata="Q2521353" url="?curid=219198" title="Hirokazu Tanaka">
<text>, also known as Chip Tanaka, is a Japanese musician, composer, sound designer, and executive who pioneered chiptune music. He is best known as one of Nintendo&#x27;s in-house composers during the 8- and 16-bit era of video games. Tanaka also had a role in designing and programming the Famicom and Game Boy audio hardware, along with the NES Zapper, Game Boy Camera, and Game Boy Printer.

Tanaka&#x27;s soundtrack credits include &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986), &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; (1986), &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; (1989), &quot;Tetris&quot; (1989), &quot;Mother&quot; (1989), &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; (1990), and &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994). He was the president and executive director of Creatures from 2001 to 2023, before resigning and becoming creative fellow in the company.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born to a schoolteacher mother who had Tanaka undergo piano lessons, Tanaka recounted that he first began paying serious attention to music while in elementary school, and attempted to form a band during that time. His first band was formed when he was in middle school, a Beatles and Elton John cover group, which sometimes performed concerts at his school. He has held a longstanding obsession with reggae music. In his teens, he was also in a reggae band, which was known variously by the names the Shampoos or Roots Rockers. For the music event &quot;Reggae Sunsplash&quot; held in Osaka, the Shampoos were an opening act for Sly and Robbie on more than one occasion. Tanaka did meet the duo during those times. On The Shampoos, Tanaka described it as an obscure local band which did gigs in Tokyo about once or twice a year, and that it was &quot;never a formal thing&quot;.

===Employment at Nintendo===
In 1980, after graduating from university with a degree in electronic engineering, Tanaka successfully applied for a job at Nintendo as a sound designer. He did not initially want to be an engineer, but Nintendo were accordingly scouting for &quot;different sounds or toys or something at the time. I thought toys would be relatively stress-free, so I applied.&quot; The first game Tanaka worked on was &quot;Space Firebird&quot; (1980), where Tanaka was composer and constructed a new sound chip for particular sound effects. Following this, Tanaka worked on &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981), providing the sound effects for Mario&#x27;s footsteps and jumps. Usually, the same sound effect was repeated across many different actions, but Tanaka&#x27;s approach differed where he invented subtle variations. He attempted to insert voice synthesis for the game&#x27;s damsel-in-distress, but the idea was vetoed by then-Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s daughter, who did not feel that the sample sounded like the exclamation &quot;help me!&quot;. Tanaka noted that he learned &quot;a lot&quot; from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto due to his perfectionism and &quot;level of commitment&quot;.

&quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot; (1983) was the first game where Tanaka acted both as composer and sound effects designer. His approach to game composition carried on from his dub obsession: &quot;For instance, if you listen to the music in &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; (1985), you could recognize that some parts are drum and bass only. So that turned out to be an idea for working around the limitations of the game software. I figured that, to get the most out of the game music, a dub-based structure would be a really great solution. I&#x27;d play the melody in some parts, then cut it off and insert a part with just drums and bass, and vice versa. No one else was doing it, but it was what I wanted to do.&quot; Tanaka described what he remembered as a &quot;typical day&quot; at Nintendo in the brief period following the release of the Famicom home game console:

While working full-time at Nintendo on two or three games a year, and sometimes two simultaneously, Tanaka continued playing gigs in Osaka and Tokyo with the Shampoos. Sometime in the late 1980s, they recorded the 45 rpm &quot;Thunder Dub&quot; which prominently sampled the opening drumbeat from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot; (1967). Tanaka did not personally see a difference between the music he composed for video games and the music he composed in his off time. For &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986), Tanaka acknowledged that games were becoming more complex, and his scores were becoming more like a film&#x27;s, desiring in &quot;Metroid&quot; not to &quot;repeat the same game-melody cliches,&quot; although he recalls that the game&#x27;s soundtrack was not well-received within Nintendo because of its dark atmosphere. He was inspired by the film &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984) to create a game score that was dark until the very end, where the player would finally receive music with a strong melody. Despite disapproval from his Nintendo colleagues, Tanaka was allowed full creative freedom on projects, and even had a fluctuating role in influencing some games&#x27; content and play style. He remembers Nintendo&#x27;s strict, repeated criticisms over the amount of &quot;fun&quot; a game would have, but that there was no financial pressure in creating games, nor were there sales quotas to meet. At the time of &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; (1990), Tanaka began observing an increasing number of &quot;serious&quot; game composers who had graduated from music schools. &quot;Dr. Mario&quot; was thus the first time Tanaka had asserted his musical personality in a game.

Tanaka was one of &quot;about five or six&quot; Nintendo-based developers who designed the Game Boy, researching and creating its audio hardware. He was inspired to develop the Game Boy Camera from a product called ViewCam that was popular at the time — Tanaka also ran experiments on the possibility of watching television via the Game Boy.

===Creatures Inc.===
At the advice of &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994) co-worker Tsunekazu Ishihara, Tanaka would join Creatures as a guest composer, where he would end up composing dozens of songs for the first Japanese &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime and various Pokémon promotional releases. Despite the fact that his themes were not used in the West, they inspired best-selling singles and albums in Japan due to their popularity there. Tanaka was eventually forbidden by Nintendo to continue to write more songs for the anime due to their policy of not allowing employees to work for other companies, so he resigned at Nintendo and joined Creatures full-time in 1999.

Tanaka succeeded Ishihara to become the president of Creatures in 2001, while Ishihara continued as CEO. Starting in the late 2000s, Tanaka began to perform at Japanese dance clubs under the name &quot;Chip Tanaka&quot;. The moniker was suggested by a foreign acquaintance, as Tanaka thought &quot;Hip Tanaka&quot; was too attached to his time at Nintendo.

After the death of Satoru Iwata in 2015, Tanaka wrote a tribute track titled &quot;Dedicated to Satoru Iwata&quot;. In April 2023, Tanaka announced he was stepping down as president and executive director of Creatures, but would remain as a Creative Fellow.

==Influences==
Tanaka has said that his tastes in his youth were typical of the time, listening to artists such as the Beatles and the Carpenters. His first exposure to dub music was through the 1978 album &quot;Negrea Love Dub&quot; by Linval Thompson while eating pasta at a restaurant with live music in Kyoto. It was the record&#x27;s use of exaggerated tape delay which astounded Tanaka, who stopped eating every time he heard it occur: &quot;I thought &#x27;Is this music sick?&#x27; But the more I listened to it, that groove with the bass line and the mixer... I think the mixer takes full control of it, directly and instinctively. When I felt it, I thought &#x27;This is amazing.&#x27; I was totally hooked.&quot; Tanaka explained his fascination with reggae music and his application for it in his game scores: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t proactive on my part. I was a music lover that happened to be working at Nintendo. ... The reason I like reggae, especially dub, is because there actually is vocal and guitar on it, let&#x27;s say, but in the essence, it&#x27;s strictly driven by drums and bass. That&#x27;s what I love about it the most. ... I think I like how there&#x27;s this raw aspect to it. The gritty, raw quality of the sound, let&#x27;s say. That really caught my ears. And that deep bass sound, the &quot;buuu...&quot; That was something I never heard before in rock music. It drove me like no other genre in music.&quot;

Among specific musical influences, Tanaka has cited Brian Wilson, Randy Newman, Stackridge, Yabby U, the Flying Lizards, Prince, Lalo Rodriguez, My Bloody Valentine, Frank Zappa, Keiichi Suzuki, Hal Willner&#x27;s various artists compilations, Sly Dunbar, Jah Wobble, and the Slits. The &quot;hip&quot; in &quot;Hip Tanaka&quot; came from hip hop, with his favorite artist of the genre being A Tribe Called Quest.

<text>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner () (DPC), also known as Data Protection Commission, is the independent national authority responsible for upholding the EU fundamental right of individuals to data privacy through the enforcement and monitoring of compliance with data protection legislation in Ireland. It was established in 1989.

== Role and operations ==
The independent role and powers of the Data Protection Commissioner are as set out in legislation in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. These Acts transpose the Council of Europe 1981 Data Protection Convention (Convention 108) and the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). However, the latter was then replaced by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is directly applicable upon Members States such as Ireland.

=== Investigation of complaints ===
Complaints received from individuals who feel that their personal information is not being treated in accordance with the data protection law are investigated under section 10 of the Data Protection Acts. It is the statutory obligation of the Office to seek to amicably resolve complaints in the first instance. Where an amicable resolution cannot be achieved, the Commissioner may make a decision on whether, in her opinion, there has been a breach of the law. If the complainant or the data controller disagrees with the Commissioner&#x27;s finding, they have the right to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court. The DPC&#x27;s main priority, if a complaint is upheld, is that the data controller complies with the law and puts right the matter concerned. If an organization does not voluntarily cooperate with an investigation, the DPC has powers of compulsion to require such cooperation.

In 2015, the Office received 932 complaints that were opened for investigation. Investigations into 1,015 complaints were concluded.

In 2018, Martin Meany, editor of Goosed.ie, filed a complaint to the DPC against the Diocese of Ossory stating he wished for his baptismal records to be deleted. The complaint started a subsequent &quot;own volition enquiry&quot; by the DPC into &quot;whether the church&#x27;s holding of personal data on baptisms and other Catholic sacraments that individuals may have taken falls under the EU&#x27;s data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation&quot;.

In 2022, Meany launched High Court Judicial Review proceedings against the DPC. He claims the DPC has failed to complete an investigation into his complaint against the Catholic Church.

In 2021, NOYB (None Of Your Business), an Austrian NGO founded by Max Schrems, filed a complaint against the DPC for corruption under Austrian law after the DPC demanded that the group sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to continue with their long-running complaint against Facebook. NOYB argued that the DPC could not demand favourable media coverage as the price of using its services.

In January 2023, DPC was forced to increase the fine issued to Meta Platforms after a review by European Data Protection Board found that the initial fine was insufficient. European Data Protection Board determined that DPC has failed to perform its enforcement responsibility with &quot;due diligence&quot;. The critics have pointed out that 7 out of 8 decisions handed down by European Data Protection Board were against the Irish DPC, and that the DPC &quot;always choose the most tortuous, lengthy and expensive legal route to a decision rather than a simple application of EU law&quot;.

=== Audits ===
Section 10 (1A) of the Acts provides that &quot;the Commissioner may carry out or cause to be carried out such investigations as he or she considers appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Act and to identify any contravention thereof.&quot; These investigations often take the form of audits of selected organizations. The aim of an audit is to identify any issues of concern about the way the organization under scrutiny manages personal data.

In 2015, the DPC carried out 51 audits and inspections of organizations in the public and private sectors.

== Enforcement ==

=== Offences under the Electronic Communications Regulations ===
All breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 for which the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has responsibility are offences. The offences relate primarily to the sending of unsolicited marketing communications by electronic means. The offences are punishable by fines – up to €5,000 for each unsolicited message on summary conviction and up to €250,000 on conviction on indictment. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner may bring summary proceedings for an offence under the Regulations.

Enforcement responsibility is shared with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

<text>A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary string of eight bits (which is also called a byte) can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.

In computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or variable-width strings. In a fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation. There are many character sets and many character encodings for them.
A bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal number. For example, the lower case &quot;a&quot;, if represented by the bit string codice_1 (as it is in the standard ASCII code), can also be represented as the decimal number 97.

==History of binary codes==


=== Invention ===
The modern binary number system, the basis for binary code, is an invention by Gottfried Leibniz in 1689 and appears in his article &quot;Explication de l&#x27;Arithmétique Binaire (&quot;English: &quot;Explanation of the Binary Arithmetic&quot;) which uses only the characters 1 and 0, and some remarks on its usefulness. Leibniz&#x27;s system uses 0 and 1, like the modern binary numeral system. Binary numerals were central to Leibniz&#x27;s intellectual and theological ideas. He believed that binary numbers were symbolic of the Christian idea of &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; or creation out of nothing.In Leibniz&#x27;s view, binary numbers represented a fundamental form of creation, reflecting the simplicity and unity of the divine. Leibniz was also attempting to find a way to translate logical reasoning into pure mathematics. He viewed the binary system as a means of simplifying complex logical and mathematical processes, believing that it could be used to express all concepts of arithmetic and logic.

=== Previous Ideas ===
Leibniz explained in his work that he encountered the &quot;I Ching&quot; by Fu Xi that dates from the 9th century BC in China, through French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet and noted with fascination how its hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 0 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical visual binary mathematics he admired. Leibniz saw the hexagrams as an affirmation of the universality of his own religious belief. After Leibniz ideas were ignored, the book had confirmed his theory that life could be simplified or reduced down to a series of straightforward propositions. He created a system consisting of rows of zeros and ones. During this time period, Leibniz had not yet found a use for this system. The binary system of the &quot;I Ching&quot; is based on the duality of yin and yang. Slit drums with binary tones are used to encode messages across Africa and Asia. The Indian scholar Pingala (around 5th–2nd centuries BC) developed a binary system for describing prosody in his &quot;Chandashutram&quot;.

Mangareva people in French Polynesia were using a hybrid binary-decimal system before 1450. In the 11th century, scholar and philosopher Shao Yong developed a method for arranging the hexagrams which corresponds, albeit unintentionally, to the sequence 0 to 63, as represented in binary, with yin as 0, yang as 1 and the least significant bit on top. The ordering is also the lexicographical order on sextuples of elements chosen from a two-element set.

In 1605 Francis Bacon discussed a system whereby letters of the alphabet could be reduced to sequences of binary digits, which could then be encoded as scarcely visible variations in the font in any random text. Importantly for the general theory of binary encoding, he added that this method could be used with any objects at all: &quot;provided those objects be capable of a twofold difference only; as by Bells, by Trumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the report of Muskets, and any instruments of like nature&quot;.

=== Boolean Logical System ===
George Boole published a paper in 1847 called &#x27;The Mathematical Analysis of Logic&#x27; that describes an algebraic system of logic, now known as Boolean algebra. Boole&#x27;s system was based on binary, a yes-no, on-off approach that consisted of the three most basic operations: AND, OR, and NOT. This system was not put into use until a graduate student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Claude Shannon, noticed that the Boolean algebra he learned was similar to an electric circuit. In 1937, Shannon wrote his master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;, which implemented his findings. Shannon&#x27;s thesis became a starting point for the use of the binary code in practical applications such as computers, electric circuits, and more.

==Other forms of binary code==

The bit string is not the only type of binary code: in fact, a binary system in general, is any system that allows only two choices such as a switch in an electronic system or a simple true or false test.

===Braille===
Braille is a type of binary code that is widely used by the blind to read and write by touch, named for its creator, Louis Braille. This system consists of grids of six dots each, three per column, in which each dot has two states: raised or not raised. The different combinations of raised and flattened dots are capable of representing all letters, numbers, and punctuation signs.

===Bagua ===
The &quot;bagua&quot; are diagrams used in &quot;feng shui,&quot; Taoist cosmology and &quot;I Ching&quot; studies. The &quot;ba gua&quot; consists of 8 trigrams; &quot;bā&quot; meaning 8 and &quot;guà&quot; meaning divination figure. The same word is used for the 64 guà (hexagrams). Each figure combines three lines (&quot;yáo&quot;) that are either broken (&quot;yin&quot;) or unbroken (&quot;yang&quot;). The relationships between the trigrams are represented in two arrangements, the primordial, &quot;Earlier Heaven&quot; or &quot;Fuxi&quot; &quot;bagua&quot;, and the manifested, &quot;Later Heaven&quot;, or &quot;King Wen&quot; &quot;bagua&quot;. (See also, the King Wen sequence of the 64 hexagrams).

===Ifá, Ilm Al-Raml and Geomancy===
The Ifá/Ifé system of divination in African religions, such as of Yoruba, Igbo, and Ewe, consists of an elaborate traditional ceremony producing 256 oracles made up by 16 symbols with 256 = 16 x 16. An initiated priest, or Babalawo, who had memorized oracles, would request sacrifice from consulting clients and make prayers. Then, divination nuts or a pair of chains are used to produce random binary numbers, which are drawn with sandy material on an &quot;Opun&quot; figured wooden tray representing the totality of fate.

Through the spread of Islamic culture, Ifé/Ifá was assimilated as the &quot;Science of Sand&quot; (ilm al-raml), which then spread further and became &quot;Science of Reading the Signs on the Ground&quot; (Geomancy) in Europe.

This was thought to be another possible route from which computer science was inspired, as Geomancy arrived at Europe at an earlier stage (about 12th Century, described by Hugh of Santalla) than I Ching (17th Century, described by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz).

==Coding systems==
===ASCII code===
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), uses a 7-bit binary code to represent text and other characters within computers, communications equipment, and other devices. Each letter or symbol is assigned a number from 0 to 127. For example, lowercase &quot;a&quot; is represented by codice_2 as a bit string (which is decimal 97).

===Binary-coded decimal===
Binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a binary encoded representation of integer values that uses a 4-bit nibble to encode decimal digits. Four binary bits can encode up to 16 distinct values; but, in BCD-encoded numbers, only ten values in each nibble are legal, and encode the decimal digits zero, through nine. The remaining six values are illegal and may cause either a machine exception or unspecified behavior, depending on the computer implementation of BCD arithmetic.

BCD arithmetic is sometimes preferred to floating-point numeric formats in commercial and financial applications where the complex rounding behaviors of floating-point numbers is inappropriate.

==Early uses of binary codes==
* 1875: Émile Baudot &quot;Addition of binary strings in his ciphering system,&quot; which, eventually, led to the ASCII of today.
* 1884: The Linotype machine where the matrices are sorted to their corresponding channels after use by a binary-coded slide rail.
* 1932: C. E. Wynn-Williams &quot;Scale of Two&quot; counter
* 1937: Alan Turing electro-mechanical binary multiplier
* 1937: George Stibitz &quot;excess three&quot; code in the Complex Computer
* 1937: Atanasoff–Berry Computer
* 1938: Konrad Zuse Z1

==Current uses of binary==
Most modern computers use binary encoding for instructions and data. CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs represent sound and video digitally in binary form. Telephone calls are carried digitally on long-distance and mobile phone networks using pulse-code modulation, and on voice over IP networks.

==Weight of binary codes==
The weight of a binary code, as defined in the table of constant-weight codes, is the Hamming weight of the binary words coding for the represented words or sequences.
