<text>The seriemas are the sole living members of the small bird family Cariamidae (the entire family is also referred to as &quot;seriemas&quot;), which is also the only surviving lineage of the order Cariamiformes. Once believed to be related to cranes, they have been placed near the falcons, parrots, and passerines, as well as the extinct Phorusrhacidae (terror birds). The seriemas are large, long-legged territorial birds that range from in length. They live in grasslands, savanna, dry woodland and open forests of Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. There are two species of seriemas, the red-legged seriema (&quot;Cariama cristata&quot;) and the black-legged seriema (&quot;Chunga burmeisteri&quot;). Names for these birds in the Tupian languages are variously spelled as &quot;siriema&quot;, &quot;sariama&quot;, and &quot;çariama&quot;, and mean &quot;crested&quot;.

==Description==
Both species are around long (the red-legged seriema is slightly bigger than the black-legged, with 90 and 70–85 cm respectively). The seriemas forage on foot and run from danger rather than fly (though they can fly for short distances, and they roost in trees). They have long legs, necks, and tails, but only short wings, reflecting their way of life. Also, they are among the largest ground-dwelling birds endemic to the Neotropics (only behind rheas).

They are brownish birds with short bills and erectile crests, found in fairly dry open country, the red-legged seriema preferring grasslands and the black-legged seriema preferring scrub and open woodland. Also, they give loud, yelping calls and are often heard before they are seen. Furthermore, they have sharp claws, with an extensible and very curved second toe claw.
==Classification==

These birds are thought to be the closest living relatives of a group of gigantic (up to tall) carnivorous &quot;terror birds&quot;, the phorusrhacids, which are known from fossils from South and North America. Several other related groups, such as the idiornithids and bathornithids were part of Palaeogene faunas in North America and Europe and possibly elsewhere too. However, the fossil record of the seriemas themselves is poor, with two prehistoric species, &quot;Chunga incerta&quot; and &quot;Miocariama patagonica&quot; (formerly &quot;Noriegavis santacrucensis&quot;), both from the Miocene of Argentina, having been described to date. Some of the fossils from the Eocene fauna of the Messel pit (i.e. &quot;Salimia&quot; and &quot;Idiornis&quot;) have also been suggested to be seriemas, as has the massive predatory &quot;Paracrax&quot; from the Oligocene of North America, though their status remains uncertain.
===Extant species===
There are two living species of seriema. 
==Behaviour and ecology==
Ecologically, the seriema is the South American counterpart of the African secretary bird. They feed on insects, snakes, lizards, frogs, young birds, and rodents, with small amounts of plant food (including maize and beans). They often associate with grazing livestock, probably to take insects the animals disturb. When seriemas catch small reptiles, they beat the prey on the ground (Redford and Peters 1986) or throw it at a hard surface to break resistance and also the bones. If the prey is too large to swallow whole, it will be ripped into smaller pieces with a sickle claw by holding the prey in the beak and tearing it apart with the claw.

Because of these feeding behaviors, seriemas are important by eating detritivores and helping the soil get more nutrients from dead plant matter.

In contact with humans, seriemas are suspicious and if they feel threatened, usually spread their wings and face the threat. They walk in pairs or small groups. Although perfectly capable of flying, they prefer to spend most of their time on land. They take flight only when necessary, for example to escape a predator. Overnight they take shelter in the treetops, where they also build their nests.

===Breeding===
The breeding biology of the seriemas is poorly known, and much of what is known comes only from red-legged seriemas. Pairs appear to be territorial and avoid others of their species while breeding, and fights between rivals have been observed. These fights involving kicking rivals, can go on for long periods of time, and involve much calling by the involved birds.

Seriemas build a large bulky stick nest, lined with leaves and dung, which is placed in a tree off the ground. The placement of the nest is so that the adults can reach the nest by foot rather than flying, through hops and the occasional flutter. Both sexes are involved in building the nest. They lay two or three white or buff eggs sparsely spotted with brown and purple. The female does most of the incubation, which lasts from 24 to 30 days. Hatchlings are downy but stay in the nest for about two weeks; after which they leave the nest and follow both parents. They reach full maturity at the age of four to five months. It is unknown when fledgling chicks reach sexual maturity.

<text>The period following the accession of Oscar II to the throne of Sweden in 1872 was marked by political conflict. The Lantmanna Party, representing peasant proprietors, dominated the Lower House of parliament, and demanded tax reductions and reforms of the system of military service. The Upper House opposed these positions. A compromise was reached in 1884 with reduction in land taxes and increased periods of military service, processes that continued in later years.

In trade policy, advocates of Protectionism gained the upper hand in 1888, and import duties were imposed on barley and other commodities. Pressure grew for extension of the franchise, leading up to the introduction in 1907 of universal manhood suffrage for elections to the Lower House, and a proportional representation system for both Houses.

During King Oscar&#x27;s reign many important social reforms were implemented. In a spirit of patriotism, physical activity was promoted: compulsory gymnastics was introduced in schools in 1880, and the Swedish Ski Association was formed in 1892.

== Politics in the New Riksdag ==
At the accession of Oscar II to the throne on 18 September 1872, the economic condition of Sweden was fairly satisfactory. In foreign affairs the security situation was good.

Politically, however, the situation was tense as the reforms inaugurated during the preceding reign did not answer expectations. Within three years of the introduction of the new electoral laws, the Louis De Geer ministry had forfeited much of its former popularity, and had been forced to resign. In the vital matter of national defence no common understanding had been arrived at, and during the conflicts which had raged round this question, the two chambers had come into frequent collision and paralysed the action of the government. The peasant proprietors, who, under the name of the &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party, formed a compact majority in the Second Chamber, pursued a consistent policy of class interests in the matter of the taxes and burdens that had, as they urged, so long oppressed the Swedish peasantry; and consequently when a bill was introduced for superseding the old system of army organization by general compulsory service, they demanded as a condition of its acceptance that the military burdens should be more evenly distributed in the country, and that the taxes, which they regarded as a burden under which they had wrongfully groaned for centuries, should be abolished. In these circumstances, the &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party in the Riksdag, who desired the lightening of the military burden, joined those who desired the abolition of landlordism, and formed a compact and predominant majority in the Second Chamber, while the burgher and Liberal parties were reduced to an impotent &quot;intelligence&quot; minority. This majority in the Lower Chamber was at once attacked by another compact majority in the Upper, who on their side maintained that the hated land taxes were only a kind of rent-charge on land, were incidental to it and in no way weighed upon the owners, and moreover that its abolition would be quite unwarrantable, as it was one of the surest sources of revenue to the state. On the other hand, the First Chamber refused to listen to any abolition of the old military system, so long as the defence of the country had not been placed upon a secure basis by the adoption of general compulsory military service. The government stood midway between these conflicting majorities in the chambers, without support in either.

== Lantmanna Party ==

The Swedish &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party was formed in 1867. It consisted mostly of the larger and smaller peasant proprietors, who at the time of the old Riksdag of the Estates were always opposed to the nobility and the clergy. The object of the party was to bring about a fusion between the representatives of the large landed proprietors and the regular peasant proprietors, to support the interests of landed proprietors in general against those of the town representatives, and to resist Crown interference in the administration of local affairs.

Such was the state of affairs when Oscar II of Sweden, surrounded by his late brother&#x27;s advisers, began his reign. One of his first priorities was to increase the strength of his Royal Swedish Navy, but in consequence of the continued antagonism of the political parties, he was unable to effect much. In the first Riksdag, however, the so-called &quot;compromise&quot;, which afterwards played such an important part in Swedish political life, came into existence. It originated in the small &quot;Scania&quot; party in the Upper House, and was devised to establish a modus vivendi between the conflicting parties, i.e. the champions of national defence and those who demanded a lightening of the burdens of taxation. The King himself perceived in the compromise a means of solving the conflicting questions, and warmly approved it. He persuaded his ministers to constitute a special inquiry into the proposed abolition of land taxes, and in the address with which he opened the Riksdag of 1875 laid particular stress upon the necessity of giving attention to the settlement of these two burning questions, and in 1880 again came forward with a new proposal for increasing the number of years of service with the militia. This motion having been rejected, De Geer resigned, and was succeeded by Count Arvid Posse. The new Prime Minister endeavoured to solve the question of defence in accordance with the views of the &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party. Three parliamentary committees had prepared schemes for a remission of the land taxes, for a new system of taxation, for a reorganization of the Swedish Army based on a &quot;stamtrupp&quot; (regular army), by the enlistment of hired soldiers, and for naval reforms. In this last connection the most suitable types of vessels for coast defence as for offence were determined upon. But Count Posse, deserted by his own party over the army bill, resigned, and was succeeded on 16 May 1884 by Robert Themptander, who had been minister of finance in the previous cabinet. The new premier succeeded in persuading the Riksdag to pass a bill increasing the period of service with the colours in the army to six years and that in the militia to forty-two days, and as a set-off a remission of 30% on the land taxes.

== Free trade vs. protectionism ==
Influenced by the economic reaction which took place in 1879 in consequence of the state of affairs in Germany, where Bismarck had introduced the protectionist system, a Protectionist party had been formed, which tried to gain adherents in the Riksdag. It is true that in the Riksdag of 1882 the commercial treaty with France was renewed, but since 1885 the protectionist party was prepared to begin the combat, and a duty on barley, which had been proposed in the Riksdag of the same year, was rejected by only a slight majority. During the period of the unusually low price of barley of 1886, which greatly affected the Swedish farmers, protection gained ground to such an extent that its final triumph was considered as certain within a short time. During the Riksdag of the same year, however, the premier, Themptander, emphatically declared himself against the protectionist party, and while the parties in the Second Chamber were equal in number, the proposed tax on barley was rejected in the First Chamber. In the Riksdag of 1887 there was a majority for protection in the Second Chamber, and in the first the majority against the tax was so small that the tax on barley would have triumphed in a combined meeting of the two chambers. The government, availing itself of its formal right not to dissolve the chamber in which it had the support of a majority, therefore dissolved only the Second Chamber in March 1887.

The new Riksdag assembled in May with a free trade majority in the Second Chamber, but nothing in connection with the great question of customs was settled. In the meantime, the powerful majority in the Second Chamber split into two groups the new &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party, which approved protection in the interests of agricultural classes; and a somewhat smaller group, the old &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party, which favored free trade.

The victory of the free traders was not to be of long duration. The protectionists obtained a majority in both chambers in the next Riksdag in 1888. To the First Chamber protectionists were almost exclusively elected, and in the Second all the twenty-two members for Stockholm were disqualified, owing to one of their number not having paid his taxes a few years previously, which prevented his being eligible. Instead, then, of twenty-two free traders representing the majority of the Stockholm electors, twenty-two protectionists, representing the minority, were elected, and Stockholm was thus represented in the Riksdag by the choice of a minority in the capital. This singular way of electing members for the principal city in the kingdom could not fail further to irritate the parties. One result of the Stockholm election came at a convenient time for the Themptander ministry. The financial affairs of the country were found to be in a most unsatisfactory state. In spite of reduced expenses, a highly estimated revenue, and the contemplated raising of taxes, there was a deficit, for the payment or discharge of which the government would be obliged to demand supplementary supplies. The Themptander ministry resigned. The King retained, however, for a time several members of the ministry, but it was difficult to find a premier who would be able, during the transition from one system to another, to command sufficient authority to control the parties. At last Baron Gillis Bildt, who, while Swedish ambassador in Berlin, had witnessed the introduction by Otto von Bismarck of the agrarian protectionist system in Germany, accepted the premiership, and it was under his auspices that the two chambers imposed a series of duties on necessaries of life. The new taxes, together with an increase of the excise duty on spirits, soon brought a surplus into the state coffers. At a Council of State on 12 October 1888 the king declared his wishes as to the way in which this surplus should be used. He desired that it should be applied to a fund for insurance and old age pensions for workmen and old people, to the lightening of the municipal taxes by state contributions to the schools and workhouses, to the abolition of the land taxes and of the obligation of keeping a horse and man for military service, and, lastly, to the improvement of the shipping trade; but the Riksdag decided to devote it to other objects, such as the payment of the deficit in the budget, the building of railways and augmentation of their material, as well as to improvements in the defenses of the country.

== The Barley Question ==
Baron Bildt resigned as soon as the new system seemed settled, making room for Baron Gustaf Åkerhielm. The latter, however, also soon resigned, and was succeeded on 10 July 1891 by Erik Gustaf Boström, a landed proprietor. The protectionist system gained in favour on the expiry of the commercial treaty with France in 1892, as it could now be extended to articles of industry. The elections of 1890, when the metropolis returned free traders and Liberals to the Second Chamber, certainly effected a change in the latter, as the representatives of the towns and the old &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party joined issue and established a free-trade majority in the chamber, but in the combined meetings of the two chambers the compact protectionist majority in the First Chamber turned the scale. The customs duties were, however, altered several times in accordance with market prices and ruling circumstances. When the import duty on ungrounded barley was reduced in 1892, the same duties were also retained for the following year. They were also retained for 1894 at the request of the government, which desired to keep faith with their promise that while the new organization of the army was going on no increase of duties on the necessaries of life should take place. This measure caused much dissatisfaction, and gave rise to a strong agrarian movement in consequence of which the government, in the beginning of 1895, before the assembling of the Riksdag, made use of its right of raising the two duties on barley just referred to, which were afterwards somewhat reduced as far as seed barley for sowing purposes was concerned.

== Reorganization of the army ==
The tariff issue now settled, that of national defence was taken up afresh, and in the following year the government produced a complete scheme for the abolition of the land tax in the course of ten years, in exchange for a compensation of ninety days&#x27; drill for those liable to military service, proposed to retain the old military system of the country and to strengthen the defences of Norrland, and the government bill for a reorganization of the Swedish Army was accepted by the Riksdag in an extraordinary session. But it was soon perceived that the new plan was unsatisfactory and required recasting, upon which the minister of war, Baron Rappe, resigned, and was succeeded by Colonel von Crustebjörn, who immediately set to work to prepare a complete reorganization of the army, with an increase of the time of active service on the lines of general compulsory service. The Riksdag of 1900, in addition to grants for the fortifications at Boden, in Norrbotten County, on the border of Russian-controlled Finland, and other military objects, voted a considerable grant for an experimental mobilization, which fully exposed the defects and faults of the old system. In the Riksdag of 1901 Gustaf Boström resigned, and was succeeded by Admiral Fredrik von Otter, who introduced a new bill for the army reorganization, the most important item of which was the increase of the period of training to 365 days. The cost in connexion with the new scheme was expected to amount to 22 million Kronor. The Riksdag, however did not accept the new plan in its full extent. The time of drilling was reduced to 240 days for the infantry, to 300 days for the navy, while for the cavalry and artillery the time fixed was 365 days. The plan, thus modified, was then accepted by the government.

== Health ==
The steady decline of death rates in Sweden began about 1820. For men and women of working age the death rate trend diverged, however, leading to increased excess male mortality during the first half of the century. There were very high rates of infant and child mortality before 1800, Among infants and children between the ages of one and four smallpox peaked as a cause of death in the 1770s–1780s and declined afterward. Mortality also peaked during this period due to other air-, food-, and waterborne diseases, but these declined as well during the early 19th century. The decline of several diseases during this time created a more favorable environment that increased children&#x27;s resistance to disease and dramatically lowered child mortality.

The introduction of compulsory gymnastics in Swedish schools in 1880 rested partly on a long tradition, from Renaissance humanism to the Enlightenment, of the importance of physical as well as intellectual training. More immediately, the promotion of gymnastics as a scientifically sound form of physical discipline coincided with the introduction of conscription, which gave the state a strong interest in educating children physically as well as mentally for the role of citizen soldiers. Skiing is a major recreation in Sweden and its ideological, functional, ecological, and social impact has been great on Swedish nationalism and consciousness. Swedes perceived skiing as virtuous, masculine, heroic, in harmony with nature, and part of the country&#x27;s culture. A growing awareness of strong national sentiments and an appreciation of natural resources led to the creation of the Swedish Ski Association in 1892 in order to combine nature, leisure, and nationalism. The organization focused its efforts on patriotic, militaristic, heroic, and environmental Swedish traditions as they relate to ski sports and outdoor life.

== Extending the voting franchise ==
After the elections in 1890, the alliance already mentioned between the old &quot;Lantmanna&quot; party and the representatives of the towns had the result that the Liberals in the Second Chamber, to whom the representatives of the towns mostly belonged, were now in a position to decide the policy which the two united parties should follow. In order to prevent this, it was proposed to readjust the number of the members of the Riksdag. The question was only settled in 1894, when a bill was passed fixing the number of the members of the Riksdag in the First Chamber at 150, and in the Second at 230, of which 150 should represent the country districts and 80 the towns. The question of protection being now considered settled, there was no longer any reason for the continued separation of the two &quot;Lantmanna&quot; parties, who at the beginning of the Riksdag of 1895 joined issue and became once more a compact majority in the Second Chamber, as they had been up to the Riksdag of May 1887. The influence of the country representatives was thus re-established in the Second Chamber, but now the demands for the extension of the franchise came more and more to the front, and the premier, Gustaf Boström, at last felt bound to do something to meet these demands. He accordingly introduced in the Riksdag of 1896 a very moderate bill for the extension of the franchise, which was, nevertheless, rejected by both chambers, all similar proposals by private members meeting the same fate. When at last the bill for the reorganization of the army, together with a considerably increased taxation, was accepted by the Riksdag of 1901, it was generally acknowledged that, in return for the increased taxation, it would only be just to extend the right of taking part in the political life and the legislative work of the country to those of the population who hitherto had been excluded from it. The government eventually laid a proposal for the extension of the franchise before the Riksdag of 1902, the chief feature of which was that the elector should be twenty-five years of age, and that married men over forty years should be entitled to two votes. The Riksdag, however, finally agreed to a proposal by Bishop Billing, a member of the First Chamber, that an address should be presented to the king asking for a full inquiry into the question of extending the franchise for the election of members to the Second Chamber.

In 1897 the Riksdag had received among its members the first socialist representative in the person of Hjalmar Branting, the leader of the Swedish Social Democrats. The socialists, who had formerly confined their activity to in 1902. Processions of many thousands of workmen were organized, in Stockholm and in other towns of the kingdom, just before the Riksdag began the discussion on the above-mentioned bill of the government, and when the bill was introduced in the chambers a general and well organized strike took place and continued during the three days the debate on the bill lasted. As this strike was of an exclusively political kind, and was intended to put pressure on the chambers, it was generally disapproved, and failed in its object. The Prime Minister, Admiral Fredrik von Otter, resigned shortly after the end of the session, and was succeeded by Gustaf Boström, the expremier, who at the request of the king again assumed office.

The question of the extension of the franchise, which was a burning one, was to be the principal measure of the Staaff government. It brought in a bill for manhood suffrage at elections for the Second Chamber, together with single member constituencies and election on the absolute majority principle. The bill was passed by the Second Chamber on 15 May 1906 by 134 to 94 votes, but it was rejected by the First Chamber by 126 to 18. The latter chamber instead passed a bill for manhood suffrage at elections for the Second Chamber, on the condition that the elections for both chambers should take place on the basis of proportional representation. Both chambers thereupon decided to ask the opinion of the king with regard to the simultaneous extension of the franchise to women at elections for the Second Chamber. The government bill having, however, been passed by the Second Chamber, the Prime Minister proposed to the king that the Riksdag should be dissolved and new elections for the Second Chamber take place in order to hear the opinion of the country, but as the king did not approve of this Mr Staaff and his government resigned.

A Conservative government was then formed on 29 May by Admiral Arvid Lindman, whose principal task was to find a solution of the suffrage question which both chambers could accept. A government bill was introduced, proposing the settlement of the question on the basis of the bill carried by the First Chamber in the Riksdag of the preceding year. A compromise, approved of by the government, was adopted by the First Chamber on 14 May 1907 by 110 votes against 29 and in the Second Chamber by 128 against 98. By this act proportional representation was established for both chambers, together with universal manhood suffrage at elections for the Second Chamber, a reduction of the qualifications for eligibility for the First Chamber and a reduction of the electoral term of this chamber from nine to six years, and finally payment of members of the First Chamber, who hitherto had not received any such emolument.

==Social reforms==
King Oscar II died on 8 December 1907, sincerely mourned by his people, and was succeeded as king of Sweden by his eldest son, Prince Gustaf. During King Oscar&#x27;s reign many important social reforms were carried out by the legislature, and the country developed in all directions. In the Riksdag of 1884 a new patent law was adopted. The age at which women should be held to attain their majority was fixed at twenty-one years and the barbarous prison punishment of &quot;bread and water&quot; abolished. In order to meet the cost of the new Swedish Army organization the Riksdag of 1902 increased the revenue by progressive taxation, but only for one year. Bills for the improvement of the social conditions of the people and in the interests of the working classes were also passed. During the five years 1884–1889 a committee was occupied with the question of workmen&#x27;s insurance, and thrice the government made proposals for its settlement, on the last occasion adopting the principle of invalidity as a common basis for insurance against accidents, illness or old age. The Riksdag, however, delayed coming to a decision, and contented itself by earmarking money for an insurance fund. At last the Riksdag of 1901 accepted a bill for insurance against accidents which also extended to agricultural labourers, in connection with the establishment of a state institution for insurance. The bill for protection against accidents, as well as for the limitation of working hours for women and children, was passed, together with one for the appointment of special factory inspectors. When in 1897 King Oscar celebrated his jubilee of twenty-five years as king, the exhibition (&quot;Konst- och Industriutställningen&quot;) which had been organized in Stockholm offered a convincing proof of the progress the country had made in every direction.

<text>The &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech was made by the British politician Enoch Powell on 20 April 1968 to a meeting of the Conservative Political Centre in Birmingham. In it Powell, who was then Shadow Secretary of State for Defence in the Shadow Cabinet of Ted Heath, strongly criticised the rates of immigration from the New Commonwealth (mostly former colonies of the British Empire) to the United Kingdom since the Second World War. He also opposed the Race Relations Bill, an anti-discrimination bill which upon receiving royal assent as the Race Relations Act 1968 criminalised the refusal of housing, employment, or public services to persons on the grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin. Powell himself called it &quot;the Birmingham speech&quot;; &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; alludes to a prophecy from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; which Powell (a classical scholar) quoted:

The speech was a national controversy, and it made Powell one of the most talked-about and divisive politicians in Britain. Heath, the leader of the Conservative Party at the time, dismissed him from the Shadow Cabinet the day after the speech. According to most accounts the popularity of Powell&#x27;s views on immigration might have been a decisive factor in the Conservative Party&#x27;s unexpected victory at the 1970 general election, although he became one of the most persistent opponents of the subsequent Heath ministry.

== Background ==
Powell, the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, was addressing the general meeting of the West Midlands Area Conservative Political Centre. The Labour government&#x27;s 1968 Race Relations Bill was to have its second reading three days later, and the Conservative Opposition had tabled an amendment significantly weakening its provisions. The bill was a successor to the Race Relations Act 1965.

The Birmingham-based television company ATV saw an advance copy of the speech on the Saturday morning, and its news editor ordered a television crew to go to the venue, where they filmed sections of the speech. Earlier in the week, Powell had said to his friend Clem Jones, a journalist and then editor at the Wolverhampton &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m going to make a speech at the weekend and it&#x27;s going to go up &#x27;fizz&#x27; like a rocket; but whereas all rockets fall to the earth, this one is going to stay up.&quot;

In preparing his speech, Powell had applied Jones&#x27;s advice that to make hard-hitting political speeches and short-circuit interference from his party organisation, his best timing was on Saturday afternoons, after delivering embargoed copies the previous Thursday or Friday to selected editors and political journalists of Sunday newspapers. This tactic could ensure coverage of the speech over three days through Saturday evening bulletins, then Sunday newspapers, thus the coverage would be picked up in Monday newspapers.

== Speech ==
In the speech Powell recounted a conversation with one of his constituents, a middle-aged working man, a few weeks earlier. Powell said that the man told him: &quot;If I had the money to go, I wouldn&#x27;t stay in this country... I have three children, all of them been through grammar school and two of them married now, with family. I shan&#x27;t be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas.&quot; The man finished by saying to Powell: &quot;In this country in 15 or 20 years&#x27; time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man&quot;.

Powell went on:

Powell quoted a letter he received from a woman in Northumberland, about an elderly woman living on a Wolverhampton street where she was the only white resident. The woman&#x27;s husband and two sons had died in the Second World War and she had rented out the rooms in her house. Once immigrants had moved into the street in which she lived, her white lodgers left. Two black men had knocked on her door at 7:00 am to use her telephone to call their employers, but she refused, as she would have done to any other stranger knocking at her door at such an hour, and was subsequently verbally abused. The woman had asked her local authority for a rates reduction, but was told by a council officer to let out the rooms of her house. When the woman said the only tenants would be black, the council officer replied: &quot;Racial prejudice won&#x27;t get you anywhere in this country.&quot;

Powell advocated voluntary re-emigration by &quot;generous grants and assistance&quot; and he mentioned that immigrants had asked him whether it was possible. He said that all citizens should be equal before the law, and that:

He argued that journalists who urged the government to pass anti-discrimination laws were &quot;of the same kidney and sometimes on the same newspapers which year after year in the 1930s tried to blind this country to the rising peril which confronted it&quot;. Powell described what he perceived to be the evolving position of the White British population:

Powell warned that if the legislation proposed for the then–Race Relations Bill were to be passed it would bring about discrimination against the native population:

Powell was concerned about the current level of immigration and argued that it must be controlled:

Powell argued that he felt that although &quot;many thousands&quot; of immigrants wanted to integrate, he felt that the majority did not, and that some had vested interests in fostering racial and religious differences &quot;with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population&quot;. Powell&#x27;s peroration of the speech gave rise to its popular title. He quotes the Sibyl&#x27;s prophecy in the epic poem &quot;Aeneid&quot;, 6, 86–87, of &quot;Terrible war, and the river Tiber foaming / With streams of blood&quot;.

== Reaction ==

===Political===
According to C. Howard Wheeldon, who was present at the meeting in which Powell gave the speech, &quot;it is fascinating to note what little hostility emerged from the audience. To the best of my memory, only one person voiced any sign of annoyance.&quot; The day after the speech, Powell went to Sunday Communion at his local church, and when he emerged, there was a crowd of journalists, and a local plasterer said to Powell: &quot;Well done, sir. It needed to be said.&quot; Powell asked the assembled journalists: &quot;Have I really caused such a furore?&quot; At midday, Powell went on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;World This Weekend&quot; to defend his speech, and he appeared later that day on ITN news.

The Labour MP Ted Leadbitter said he would refer the speech to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe spoke of a &quot;prima facie&quot; case against Powell for incitement. Lady Gaitskell called the speech &quot;cowardly&quot;, and the West Indian cricketer Sir Learie Constantine condemned it.

The leading Conservatives in the Shadow Cabinet were outraged by the speech. Iain Macleod, Edward Boyle, Quintin Hogg and Robert Carr all threatened to resign from the front bench unless Powell was sacked. Margaret Thatcher, who was then the Shadow Cabinet&#x27;s Fuel and Power Spokesman, thought that some of Powell&#x27;s speech was &quot;strong meat&quot;, and said to the Conservative leader, Edward Heath when he telephoned her to inform her Powell was to be sacked: &quot;I really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis&quot;. Heath sacked Powell from his post as Shadow Defence Secretary, telling him on the telephone that Sunday evening (it was the last conversation they would have). Heath said of the speech in public that it was &quot;racialist in tone and liable to exacerbate racial tensions&quot;. Conservative MPs on the right of the party—Duncan Sandys, Gerald Nabarro, Teddy Taylor—spoke against Powell&#x27;s sacking. On 22 April 1968, Heath went on &quot;Panorama&quot;, telling Robin Day: &quot;I dismissed Mr Powell because I believed his speech was inflammatory and liable to damage race relations. I am determined to do everything I can to prevent racial problems developing into civil strife ... I don&#x27;t believe the great majority of the British people share Mr Powell&#x27;s way of putting his views in his speech.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; declared it &quot;an evil speech&quot;, stating &quot;This is the first time that a serious British politician has appealed to racial hatred in this direct way in our postwar history.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; went on to record incidents of racial attacks in the immediate aftermath of Powell&#x27;s speech. One such incident, reported under the headline &quot;Coloured family attacked&quot;, took place on 30 April 1968 in Wolverhampton itself: it involved a slashing incident with 14 white youths chanting &quot;Powell&quot; and &quot;Why don&#x27;t you go back to your own country?&quot; at patrons of a West Indian christening party. One of the West Indian victims, Wade Crooks of Lower Villiers Street, was the child&#x27;s grandfather. He had to have eight stitches over his left eye. He was reported as saying, &quot;I have been here since 1955 and nothing like this has happened before. I am shattered.&quot; An opinion poll commissioned by the BBC television programme &quot;Panorama&quot; in December 1968 found that eight per cent of immigrants believed that they had been treated worse by white people since Powell&#x27;s speech, 38 per cent would like to return to their country of origin if offered financial help, and 47 per cent supported immigration control, with 30 per cent opposed.

The speech generated much correspondence to newspapers, most markedly with the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; in Wolverhampton itself, whose local sorting office over the following week received 40,000 postcards and 8,000 letters addressed to its local newspaper. Jones recalled:

At the end of that week there were two simultaneous processions in Wolverhampton, one of Powell&#x27;s supporters and another of opponents, who each brought petitions to Jones outside his office, the two columns being kept apart by police.

On 23 April 1968, the Race Relations Bill had its second reading in the House of Commons. Many MPs referred or alluded to Powell&#x27;s speech. For Labour, Paul Rose, Maurice Orbach, Reginald Paget, Dingle Foot, Ivor Richard and David Ennals were all critical. Among the Conservatives, Quintin Hogg and Nigel Fisher were critical, while Hugh Fraser, Ronald Bell, Dudley Smith and Harold Gurden were sympathetic. Powell himself was present for the debate but did not speak.

Earlier that day, 1,000 London dockers had gone on strike in protest of Powell&#x27;s sacking and marched from the East End to the Palace of Westminster carrying placards with sayings such as &quot;we want Enoch Powell!&quot;, &quot;Enoch here, Enoch there, we want Enoch everywhere&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t knock Enoch&quot; and &quot;Back Britain, not Black Britain&quot;. Three hundred of them went into the palace, 100 to lobby the MP for Stepney, Peter Shore, and 200 to lobby the MP for Poplar, Ian Mikardo. Shore and Mikardo were shouted down and some dockers kicked Mikardo. Lady Gaitskell shouted: &quot;You will have your remedy at the next election.&quot; The dockers replied: &quot;We won&#x27;t forget.&quot; The organiser of the strike, Harry Pearman, headed a delegation to meet Powell and said after: &quot;I have just met Enoch Powell and it made me feel proud to be an Englishman. He told me that he felt that if this matter was swept under the rug he would lift the rug and do the same again. We are representatives of the working man. We are not racialists.&quot;

On 24 April 600 dockers at St Katharine Docks voted to strike and numerous smaller factories across the country followed. Six hundred Smithfield meat porters struck and marched to Westminster and handed Powell a 92-page petition supporting him. Powell advised against strike action and asked them to write to Harold Wilson, Heath or their MP. However, strikes continued, reaching Tilbury by 25 April and he allegedly received his 30,000th letter supporting him, with 30 protesting against his speech. By 27 April, 4,500 dockers were on strike. On 28 April, 1,500 people marched to Downing Street chanting &quot;Arrest Enoch Powell&quot;. Powell claimed to have received 43,000 letters and 700 telegrams supporting him by early May, with 800 letters and four telegrams against. On 2 May, the attorney general, Sir Elwyn Jones, announced he would not prosecute Powell after consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The Gallup Organization took an opinion poll at the end of April and found that 74 per cent agreed with what Powell had said in his speech; 15 per cent disagreed. 69 per cent felt Heath was wrong to sack Powell and 20 per cent believed Heath was right. Before his speech Powell was favoured to replace Heath as Conservative leader by one per cent, with Reginald Maudling favoured by 20 per cent; after his speech 24 per cent favoured Powell and 18 per cent Maudling. 83 per cent now felt immigration should be restricted (75 per cent before the speech) and 65 per cent favoured anti-discrimination legislation. According to George L. Bernstein, the speech made the British people think that Powell &quot;was the first British politician who was actually listening to them&quot;.

Powell defended his speech on 4 May through an interview for the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;: &quot;What I would take &#x27;racialist&#x27; to mean is a person who believes in the inherent inferiority of one race of mankind to another, and who acts and speaks in that belief. So the answer to the question of whether I am a racialist is &#x27;no&#x27;—unless, perhaps, it is to be a racialist in reverse. I regard many of the peoples in India as being superior in many respects—intellectually, for example, and in other respects—to Europeans. Perhaps that is over-correcting.&quot; On 5 May the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, made his first public statement on race and immigration since Powell&#x27;s speech. He told Labour supporters at a May Day rally in Birmingham Town Hall:

I am not prepared to stand aside and see this country engulfed by the racial conflict which calculating orators or ignorant prejudice can create. Nor in the great world confrontation on race and colour, where this country must declare where it stands, am I prepared to be a neutral, whether that confrontation is in Birmingham or Bulawayo. In these issues there can be no neutrals and no escape from decision. For in the world of today, while political isolationism invites danger and economic isolationism invites bankruptcy, moral isolationism invites contempt.

In a speech to the Labour Party conference in Blackpool that October, Wilson said: 

We are the party of human rights—the only party of human rights that will be speaking from this platform this month. (Loud applause.) The struggle against racialism is a worldwide fight. It is the dignity of man for which we are fighting. If what we assert is true for Birmingham, it is true for Bulawayo. If ever there were a condemnation of the values of the party which forms the Opposition it is the fact that the virus of Powellism has taken so firm a hold at every level.

Powell himself criticised the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; title attributed to the speech, which he claimed was the misappropriation of his words. Whilst defending the contents, he told a rally in Bristol that he only saw the &quot;prospect of a bloody conflict&quot;. In his notes, he termed it &quot;Speech in Birmingham&quot;.

During the 1970 general election the majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party did not wish to &quot;stir up the Powell issue&quot;. However, Labour MP Tony Benn said:

According to most accounts, the popularity of Powell&#x27;s perspective on immigration may have played a decisive contributory factor in the Conservatives&#x27; surprise victory in the 1970 general election, although Powell became one of the most persistent opponents of the subsequent Heath government. In &quot;exhaustive research&quot; on the election, the American pollster Douglas Schoen and University of Oxford academic R. W. Johnson believed it &quot;beyond dispute&quot; that Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives, but nationally the Conservative vote had increased by only 1.7 million since 1966. In his own constituency at that election—his last in Wolverhampton—his majority of 26,220 and a 64.3 per cent share of the vote were then the highest of his career.

===Powell&#x27;s reflection on the speech===
Powell reflected on the speech in an interview in 1977 when the interviewer asked him, &quot;nine years after the speech, are we still in your view on a kind of funeral pyre?&quot;:

The interviewer then asked him, &quot;what do you see as the likely prospect now? Still the &#x27;River Tiber foaming with blood&#x27;?&quot;:

Polls in the 1960s and 1970s showed that Powell&#x27;s views were popular among the British population at the time. A Gallup poll, for example, showed that 75% of the population were sympathetic to Powell&#x27;s views. An NOP poll showed that approximately 75% of the British population agreed with Powell&#x27;s demand for non-white immigration to be halted completely, and about 60% agreed with his call for the repatriation of non-whites already resident in Britain.

The Rivers of Blood speech has been blamed for leading to violent attacks against British Pakistanis and other British South Asians, which became frequent after the speech in 1968; however, there is &quot;little agreement on the extent to which Powell was responsible for racial attacks&quot;. These &quot;Paki-bashing&quot; attacks later peaked during the 1970s and 1980s.

Powell was mentioned in early versions of the 1969 song &quot;Get Back&quot; by The Beatles. This early version of the song, known as the &quot;No Pakistanis&quot; version, parodied the anti-immigrant views of Enoch Powell.

On 5 August 1976, Eric Clapton provoked an uproar and lingering controversy when he spoke out against increasing immigration during a concert in Birmingham. Visibly intoxicated, Clapton voiced his support of the controversial speech, and announced on stage that Britain was in danger of becoming a &quot;black colony&quot;. Among other things, Clapton said &quot;Keep Britain white!&quot; which was at the time a National Front slogan.

In November 2010, the actor and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar recalled the fear which the speech instilled in Britons of Indian origin: &quot;At the end of the 1960s, Enoch Powell was quite a frightening figure to us. He was the one person who represented an enforced ticket out, so we always had suitcases that were ready and packed. My parents held the notion that we may have to leave.&quot;

While a section of the white population appeared to warm to Powell over the speech, the author Mike Phillips recalls that it legitimised hostility, and even violence, towards black Britons like himself.

In his book &quot;The British Dream&quot; (2013), David Goodhart claims that Powell&#x27;s speech in effect &quot;put back by more than a generation a robust debate about the successes and failures of immigration&quot;.

== Identity of the woman mentioned in the speech ==
After Powell delivered the speech, there were attempts to locate the Wolverhampton constituent whom Powell described as being victimised by non-white residents. The editor of the local Wolverhampton newspaper the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;, Clem Jones claimed he was unable to identify the woman using the electoral roll and other sources.

Shortly after Powell&#x27;s death, Kenneth Nock, a Wolverhampton solicitor, wrote to the &quot;Express and Star&quot; in April 1998 to claim that his firm had acted for the woman in question, but that he could not name her owing to rules concerning client confidentiality. In January 2007, the BBC Radio Four programme &quot;Document&quot; claimed to have uncovered the woman&#x27;s identity. They said she was Druscilla Cotterill (1907–1978), the widow of Harry Cotterill, a battery quartermaster sergeant with the Royal Artillery who had been killed in the Second World War. She lived in Brighton Place in Wolverhampton, which by the 1960s was dominated by alien families. In order to increase her income, she rented rooms to lodgers, but stopped taking in any lodgers when the Race Relations Act 1968 made it unsafe for her to do so.

== Support for the speech ==
In the United Kingdom, particularly in England, &quot;Enoch [Powell] was right&quot; is a phrase of political rhetoric, inviting comparison of aspects of current English society with the predictions made by Powell in the &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. The phrase implies criticism of racial quotas, immigration and multiculturalism. Badges, T-shirts and other items bearing the slogan have been produced at different times in the United Kingdom. Powell gained support from both right-wing and traditionally left-leaning, working-class voters for his anti-immigration stance.

Powell gained the support of the far-right in Britain. Badges, T-shirts and fridge magnets emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Enoch was right&quot; are regularly seen at far-right demonstrations, according to VICE News. Powell also has a presence on social media, with an Enoch Powell page on Facebook run by the far-right Traditional Britain Group which amassed several thousands of likes, and similar pages which post &quot;racist memes and &quot;Daily Mail&quot; stories&quot; have been equally successful, such as British nationalist and anti-immigration Britain First&#x27;s Facebook page.

In &quot;The Trial of Enoch Powell&quot;, a Channel 4 television broadcast in April 1998, on the thirtieth anniversary of his Rivers of Blood speech (and two months after his death), 64% of the studio audience voted that Powell was not a racist. Some in the Church of England, of which Powell had been a member, took a different view. Upon Powell&#x27;s death, Barbados-born Wilfred Wood, then Bishop of Croydon, stated, &quot;Enoch Powell gave a certificate of respectability to white racist views which otherwise decent people were ashamed to acknowledge&quot;.

In March 2016, right-wing German writer Michael Stürmer wrote a retrospective pro-Powell piece in &quot;Die Welt&quot;, opining that nobody else had been &quot;punished so mercilessly&quot; by fellow party members and media for their viewpoints.

Trevor Phillips wrote in May 2016 on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;Rome may not yet be in flames, but I think I can smell the smouldering whilst we hum to the music of liberal self-delusion&quot; by ignoring the effects of mass immigration. He explicitly compared his warning to Powell&#x27;s: &quot;He too summoned up echoes of Rome with his reference to Virgil&#x27;s dire premonition of the River Tiber &#x27;foaming with much blood&#x27;&quot;. From the damage the reaction to the speech did to Powell&#x27;s career, Phillips wrote, &quot;Everyone in British public life learnt the lesson: adopt any strategy possible to avoid saying anything about race, ethnicity (and latterly religion and belief) that is not anodyne and platitudinous&quot;.

In October 2018, support for the speech was expressed by the Plymouth University Conservatives who referenced the phrase &quot;Enoch was Right&quot; on one of the apparel worn for a society gathering.

In November 2022, conservative political commentator Calvin Robinson, who is also a deacon for the Free Church of England, praised Enoch Powell&#x27;s speech in an article for his blog.

== Acknowledgement from politicians ==
In an interview for &quot;Today&quot; shortly after her departure from office as Prime Minister in 1990, Margaret Thatcher said that Powell had &quot;made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms&quot;.

Thirty years after the speech, Heath said that Powell&#x27;s remarks on the &quot;economic burden of immigration&quot; had been &quot;not without prescience&quot;.

The Labour Party MP Michael Foot remarked to a reporter that it was &quot;tragic&quot; that this &quot;outstanding personality&quot; had been widely misunderstood as predicting actual bloodshed in Britain, when in fact he had used the &quot;Aeneid&quot; quotation merely to communicate his own sense of foreboding.

In November 2007, Nigel Hastilow resigned as Conservative candidate for Halesowen and Rowley Regis after he wrote an article in the Wolverhampton &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; that included the statement: &quot;Enoch, once MP for Wolverhampton South-West, was sacked from the Conservative front bench and marginalised politically for his 1968 &#x27;Rivers of Blood&#x27; speech, warning that uncontrolled immigration would change Britain irrevocably. He was right and immigration has changed the face of Britain dramatically.&quot;

In January 2014, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, after being told during an interview that a statement just read to him had come from Powell&#x27;s speech, said: &quot;Well what he was warning about was the large influx of people into an area, that change an area beyond recognition, there is tension – the basic principle is right.&quot; In June of that year, in response to the alleged Islamist Operation Trojan Horse, Conservative peer and former minister Norman Tebbit wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;No one should have been surprised at what was going on in schools in Birmingham. It is precisely what I was talking about over 20 years ago and Enoch Powell was warning against long before that. We have imported far too many immigrants who have come here not to live in our society, but to replicate here the society of their homelands.&quot; Conservative MP Gerald Howarth said on the same issue, &quot;Clearly, the arrival of so many people of non-Christian faith has presented a challenge, as so many of us, including the late Enoch Powell, warned decades ago.&quot;

In April 2018, the leader of UKIP in Wales, Neil Hamilton, said that &quot;the idea that Enoch Powell was some kind of uniquely racist villain is absolute nonsense&quot;. Hamilton said that Powell had been &quot;proved right by events&quot; in terms of social change if not violence. In response, the leader of Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, accused Hamilton of &quot;keeping Powell&#x27;s racist rhetoric going&quot;. Labour AM Hefin David described Hamilton&#x27;s comments as &quot;outrageous&quot;.

==Dramatic portrayals==
The speech is the subject of a play, &quot;What Shadows&quot;, written by Chris Hannan. The play was staged in Birmingham from 27 October to 12 November 2016, with Powell portrayed by Ian McDiarmid and Jones by George Costigan.

&quot;The Speech&quot;, a novel by author Andrew Smith set in Wolverhampton during the ten days before and after the speech and featuring Powell as a character, was published in October 2016 by Urbane Publications.

In April 2018 the BBC announced that Archive on 4 would transmit &quot;50 Years On: Rivers of Blood&quot;, a programme marking the 50th anniversary of the speech. Ian McDiarmid would read the entire speech, the first time it would be broadcast on British radio, and it would be discussed and analysed. In the days before the broadcast, there was criticism from a number of commentators of the BBC&#x27;s decision to broadcast the still-controversial speech.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2023, Season 12 Episode 1 of &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; (&#x27;April 1968&#x27;) aired, dealing with the aftermath and impact of the speech, including the 1968 dockworkers&#x27; strike.

<doc id="217548" wikidata="Q2051983" url="?curid=217548" title="Conjugate transpose">
<text>In mathematics, the conjugate transpose, also known as the Hermitian transpose, of an formula_1 complex matrix formula_2 is an formula_3 matrix obtained by transposing formula_2 and applying complex conjugation to each entry (the complex conjugate of formula_5 being formula_6, for real numbers formula_7 and formula_8). There are several notations, such as formula_9 or formula_10, formula_11, or (often in physics) formula_12.

For real matrices, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose, formula_13.

==Definition==
The conjugate transpose of an formula_1 matrix formula_2 is formally defined by

|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where the subscript formula_16 denotes the formula_17-th entry (matrix element), for formula_18 and formula_19, and the overbar denotes a scalar complex conjugate.

This definition can also be written as
:formula_20

where formula_21 denotes the transpose and formula_22 denotes the matrix with complex conjugated entries.

Other names for the conjugate transpose of a matrix are Hermitian transpose, Hermitian conjugate, adjoint matrix or transjugate. The conjugate transpose of a matrix formula_2 can be denoted by any of these symbols:
* formula_10, commonly used in linear algebra
* formula_9, commonly used in linear algebra
* formula_26 (sometimes pronounced as &quot;A dagger&quot;), commonly used in quantum mechanics
* formula_27, although this symbol is more commonly used for the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse

In some contexts, formula_10 denotes the matrix with only complex conjugated entries and no transposition.

==Example==
Suppose we want to calculate the conjugate transpose of the following matrix formula_2.
:formula_30
We first transpose the matrix:
:formula_31
Then we conjugate every entry of the matrix:
:formula_32

==Basic remarks==
A square matrix formula_2 with entries formula_34 is called
* Hermitian or self-adjoint if formula_35; i.e., formula_36.
* Skew Hermitian or antihermitian if formula_37; i.e., formula_38.
* Normal if formula_39.
* Unitary if formula_40, equivalently formula_41, equivalently formula_42.

Even if formula_2 is not square, the two matrices formula_44 and formula_45 are both Hermitian and in fact positive semi-definite matrices.

The conjugate transpose &quot;adjoint&quot; matrix formula_9 should not be confused with the adjugate, formula_47, which is also sometimes called &quot;adjoint&quot;.

The conjugate transpose of a matrix formula_2 with real entries reduces to the transpose of formula_2, as the conjugate of a real number is the number itself.

The conjugate transpose can be motivated by noting that complex numbers can be usefully represented by formula_50 real matrices, obeying matrix addition and multiplication:
formula_51

That is, denoting each &quot;complex&quot; number formula_52 by the &quot;real&quot; formula_50 matrix of the linear transformation on the Argand diagram (viewed as the &quot;real&quot; vector space formula_54), affected by complex &quot;formula_52&quot;-multiplication on formula_56.

Thus, an formula_1 matrix of complex numbers could be well represented by a formula_58 matrix of real numbers. The conjugate transpose, therefore, arises very naturally as the result of simply transposing such a matrix—when viewed back again as an formula_3 matrix made up of complex numbers.

For an explanation of the notation used here, we begin by representing complex numbers formula_60 as the rotation matrix, that is,
formula_61
Since formula_62, we are led to the matrix representations of the unit numbers as
formula_63

A general complex number formula_64 is then represented as formula_65 The complex conjugate operation (that sends formula_66 to formula_67 for real formula_68) is encoded as the matrix transpose.

==Properties==
* formula_69 for any two matrices formula_2 and formula_71 of the same dimensions.
* formula_72 for any complex number formula_52 and any formula_1 matrix formula_2.
* formula_76 for any formula_1 matrix formula_2 and any formula_79 matrix formula_71. Note that the order of the factors is reversed.
* formula_81 for any formula_1 matrix formula_2, i.e. Hermitian transposition is an involution.
* If formula_2 is a square matrix, then formula_85 where formula_86 denotes the determinant of formula_2 .
* If formula_2 is a square matrix, then formula_89 where formula_90 denotes the trace of formula_2.
* formula_2 is invertible if and only if formula_9 is invertible, and in that case formula_94.
* The eigenvalues of formula_9 are the complex conjugates of the eigenvalues of formula_2.
* formula_97 for any formula_1 matrix formula_2, any vector in formula_100 and any vector formula_101. Here, formula_102 denotes the standard complex inner product on formula_103, and similarly for formula_104.

==Generalizations==
The last property given above shows that if one views formula_2 as a linear transformation from Hilbert space formula_106 to formula_107 then the matrix formula_9 corresponds to the adjoint operator of formula_109. The concept of adjoint operators between Hilbert spaces can thus be seen as a generalization of the conjugate transpose of matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis.

Another generalization is available: suppose formula_110 is a linear map from a complex vector space formula_111 to another, formula_112, then the complex conjugate linear map as well as the transposed linear map are defined, and we may thus take the conjugate transpose of formula_110 to be the complex conjugate of the transpose of formula_110. It maps the conjugate dual of formula_112 to the conjugate dual of formula_111.

<text>Merzig-Wadern is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwest of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Trier-Saarburg, Sankt Wendel, Saarlouis, the French &quot;département&quot; Moselle, and Luxembourg.

==History==
The district was created in 1816 when the area became property of Prussia. After World War I the Saar area was under special government of the League of Nations, which split the district into two. The area around Wadern stayed Prussian, while the Merzig area became part of the Saar area. In 1935, the Saar area rejoined Germany; however, it took till after the World War II that the two parts of the district were reunited in 1946.

==Geography==
The river Saar flows through the district, the Moselle forms the boundary in the west to Luxembourg.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show the symbols of those countries which had possessions in the district&#x27;s area. The top-left show the cross of Trier, the top-right those of Lorraine. The wolf hook in the bottom-left represents Dagstuhl, which owned Wadern; the lion in the bottom-right stands for Luxembourg, which owned the western part of the district.

<doc id="217553" wikidata="Q2063470" url="?curid=217553" title="Fort Christina">
<text>Fort Christina, also called Fort Altena, was the first Swedish settlement in North America and the principal settlement of the New Sweden colony. Built in 1638 and named after Christina, Queen of Sweden, it was located approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) east of the present-day downtown Wilmington, Delaware, at the confluence of the Brandywine River and the Christina River, approximately 2 mi (3 km) upstream from the mouth of the Christina on the Delaware River.

==History==


Following plans by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to establish a Swedish colony in North America, the Swedes arrived in Delaware Bay (Fort Christina) on March 29, 1638, aboard the ships &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; and &quot;Fogel Grip&quot; under the command of Peter Minuit, the former director of the New Netherland colony. They landed at a spot along the Christina River at a stone outcropping which formed a natural wharf, known as &quot;The Rocks.&quot; Minuit selected the site on the Christina River near the Delaware as being optimal for trade in beaver pelts with the local Lenape. He also considered the site easily defensible, and he ordered the construction of an earthwork fort around the Rocks.

At the time, the Dutch had claimed the area south to the Delaware (then called &quot;South River&quot;). The Swedes claimed an area for the Realm of Sweden on the south side of the Delaware that encompassed much of the present-day U.S. state of Delaware, eventually including parts of present-day southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey on the north side of the river.

The fort&#x27;s earthworks were strengthened in 1640 by Governor Peter Hollander Ridder to help defend against the possibility of Dutch or Native American attacks. As additional colonists arrived from Sweden in the years following the landing, homes and farms began to be built outside of the confines of the fort. The fort was rebuilt entirely in 1647.

The colony of New Sweden remained in constant friction with the Dutch. In 1651, the Dutch under Peter Stuyvesant established Fort Casimir at present-day New Castle, only 7 mi (12 km) south of Fort Christina, in order to menace the Swedish settlement. In 1654, the Swedes captured Fort Casimir under the orders of Governor Johan Risingh. Risingh, fearing reprisals, strengthened the defenses of Fort Christina by adding a wooden palisade around the earthworks.

In 1655, the Dutch under Stuyvesant returned in force and laid siege to Fort Christina. The fort&#x27;s surrender after ten days ended the official Swedish colonial presence in North America, though most of the colonists remained and were allowed to continue their linguistic and religious practices by the Dutch. Stuyvesant renamed Fort Christina as Fort Altena. It is noteworthy to the modern reader that the struggle for Fort Christina and Fort Casimir involved hundreds of mercenaries and chartered warships, and was run personally by Stuyvesant, but was not seen at the time as in any way a war between the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden. It was rather a struggle between the Dutch West India Company and the Swedish West India Company.

The land remained as part of New Netherland until it became part of the English possessions when an English fleet invaded the area in 1664. Under English rule, the original Swedish fortifications around the Rocks fell into disrepair and eventually vanished entirely.

New fortifications were built by the Americans on the same site during the Revolutionary period, and they established Fort Union here during the War of 1812. Men involved in the defense of the fort included Caesar Augustus Rodney and James A. Bayard Sr.

During the nineteenth century, the peninsula where the fort once stood became heavily industrialized, and included factories for the Jackson and Sharp Company and Mingus Iron Works.

==Fort Christina National Historic Landmark==

In 1938, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Swedish colonization of the area, the state of Delaware created a park which contained the Rocks and the site of the former forts. The dedication was attended by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Crown Prince Gustav Adolf, Crown Princess Louise, and Prince Bertil. The Prince presented a gift from their homeland: a monument, topped by a replica of the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;, designed by Swedish sculptor Carl Milles.

During the ceremony, the Prince spoke of the site&#x27;s significance to both countries:
The monument to be unveiled today is a gift from the people of Sweden to the people of the United States. The funds were raised through public subscription, wherein several hundred thousands of our citizens took part. I believe that amongst these subscribers, many had across the Atlantic brothers and sisters, parents and children. In contributing, they must have felt the links, which connect them and all of us with your great country, where so many of the citizens are either of Swedish birth or purely or partly of Swedish descent.

Near this spot, the Fort Christina State Park, was the first permanent settlement in the Delaware Valley. The Swedes, who landed here 300 years ago, were few in number and of poor means. Yet thus began the relations between our two Nations. Indeed, it is fitting that, together, we should commemorate that event, the inauguration of an unbroken period of international friendship.

We shall be reminded of these facts by the monument, cut by our famous sculptor, Carl Milles, in the black granite of Sweden. What memories are summoned forth at a moment like this. It is with pride we recall the memory of those almost legendary pioneers who braved the Atlantic in their little vessel, the Kalmar Nyckel, and who came to found the colony of New Sweden. That little band of gallant men and women have inscribed their names on the pages of history. Their deeds have been considered important enough for the President and Congress of the United States to extend an official invitation to Sweden to take part in the commemorative celebration of this historic event. We of Sweden are deeply moved by this mark of your esteem. It meets with our high appreciation and we offer you our most sincere thanks.

In our common acclaim of a historic event of 300 years ago, we stand united, as in our admiration of those early settlers from Sweden who were such worthy and resourceful people. Their love of freedom and their integrity they carried with them as a heritage from the land of their birth. We are happy to feel that in some measure they, as well as their successors during the intervening three centuries, were able to contribute to the development into greatness of your country, the country of their adoption. We are proud to think that their virtue and valor were brought down to their descendants and thus helped in the formation of those traits which we admire in the American people of the present day.

President Roosevelt, in accepting the monument, responded that, &quot;I am fortunate in having personal association with the colony of Sweden, for one of my ancestors, William Beekman, served as vice director or governor of the colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River from 1658 to 1663.&quot;

In May 2013, for the 375th anniversary of the Swedish landing, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, along with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, reenacted the landing of the &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; at Fort Christina Park on a replica of the original ship.

The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. In 2014, the First State National Historical Park was authorized to potentially include Fort Christina; it now is part of the site.

<text>Restrepia chocoensis is a species of flowering plant in the family &quot;Orchidaceae&quot;. It is named for the Department of Chocó, Colombia, where it was discovered.

This rare epiphytic species has only been found on two occasions in the cool, damp montane forests of the Western Cordillera of Colombia at altitudes between 1,800 m to 2,000 m.

This tiny orchid lacks pseudobulbs. The erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape. The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.

The flowers develop one at a time at the base of the leaf. They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf. The long dorsal sepal is erect and ends in a somewhat thicker club-shaped tip. They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals), which splits at its end. They are quite colorful : tan overlaid with contrasting reddish-purple spots. The long, lateral petals equally end in a thickened club-shaped tip. The shorter lip is ovoid. It shows the same variations in color and markings.

<text>Marc Aaronson (August 24, 1950 – April 30, 1987) was an American astronomer.
==Life==
Aaronson was born in Los Angeles.

He was educated at the California Institute of Technology, where he received a BS in 1972. He completed his Ph.D. in 1977 at Harvard University with a dissertation on the near-infrared aperture photometry of galaxies. He joined Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona as a postdoctoral research associate in 1977 and became an Associate Professor of Astronomy in 1983. Aaronson and Jeremy Mould won the George Van Biesbroeck Prize in 1981 and the Newton Lacy Pierce Prize in Astronomy in 1984 from the American Astronomical Society. He was also awarded the Bart J. Bok Prize in 1983 from Harvard University.

His work concentrated on three fields: the determination of the Hubble constant (H0) using the Tully–Fisher relation, the study of carbon rich stars, and the velocity distribution of those stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

Aaronson was one of the first astronomers to attempt to image dark matter using infrared imaging. He imaged infrared halos of unknown matter around galaxies that could be dark matter.

==Death==
Aaronson died in an accident in the evening hours of 30 April 1987, in the dome of the 4-m Mayall Telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory. He was killed when he was crushed by the hatch leading out to the catwalk; the hatch was slammed shut on him by a ladder which extended down from the turning telescope dome. A switch on the hatch automatically shut down the dome rotation motor; however, the momentum of the dome kept it moving for a few moments, allowing it to hit the outward opening hatch. This design flaw was corrected after the accident by trimming the ladder and redesigning the hatch to slide sideways, parallel to the dome wall.

Asteroid 3277 Aaronson is named in his honor.

==The Marc Aaronson Memorial Lectureship==
The Marc Aaronson Memorial Lectureship, promoting and recognizing excellence in astronomical research, is held every 18 months by the University of Arizona and Steward Observatory as a tribute to his memory.

<doc id="217559" wikidata="Q2253711" url="?curid=217559" title="Abdul Latif Sharif">
<text>Abdul Latif Sharif, first name also spelled Abdel (September 19, 1947 – June 2, 2006), was an Egyptian-born Mexican chemist and chief suspect in the Juárez killings, a decade-long murder spree that began in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez in the early 1990s.

==Background==

===Childhood and youth===
Sharif was born in Egypt as an only child. Growing up, he suffered constant sexual abuse from his father and several male relatives. Although his father was opposed to him attending school, Sharif showed signs of above-average intelligence. He also liked spending his time training carrier pigeons and going fishing in the river. When he was 12 years old, at his father&#x27;s behest, he agreed to marry his 10-year-old cousin. Three years later Sharif reneged on the idea of marrying to instead travel to the United States. His family disapproved of this that anecdotally, his aunt is said to have exercised some sort of spell and witchcraft upon him.

In Egypt, Sharif studied chemical engineering at Cairo University, where he achieved an average of 9.9. Working as a high school and university instructor, he spent some time in the Soviet Union before traveling to New York and found work in cosmetics, paint, and skin-care companies. He was thought to be attractive and was found to be successful in his chosen field of profession. He somehow became quite obsessed with women during his 21-year stay in the United States. He married twice and had five other partners with whom he lived for some significant periods of time.

===Arrival and life in America===
Sharif emigrated legally to the United States in 1970. In New York, he had a job where he remained employed for eight years. He was later fired in 1978 because of his alcohol problems. He then moved to Pennsylvania and resided there for three years. In 1981, he moved to Florida and got employed in a company called Cercoa, Inc. It was here that he committed his first sexual assault. In 1982, he got married but quickly got divorced as a result of his violent behavior toward his wife. He became prominent as a chemist, and during a stay in Mexico he kept patents on various petrochemical processes he had invented.

==Crimes==
===Imputation for sexual abuse===
According to official accounts, Sharif, as a person, was promiscuous. He was also thought to be an alcoholic and a pedophile. He purportedly tortured animals during hunting expeditions and had sexual fetishes like collecting girls&#x27; clothes. However, other sources say that these behaviors were mere fabrications by the prosecution to pass as credible accusations against Sharif.

Sharif&#x27;s first account of sexual assault took place on 2 May 1981 in North Palm Beach, Florida. He tricked a woman by offering her a job as a housekeeper. He kidnapped her and later attacked, and sexually assaulted the victim. Upon release, the victim claimed that he said, &quot;Oh, did I hurt you? You must go to a hospital.&quot;

Cercoa, Inc, his place of employment, paid for his defense. Despite having argued that the sex was consensual, Sharif was convicted on charges of assault, rape, and unlawful deprivation of liberty. He was eventually released on parole.

In August 1981, right after leaving prison, he assaulted another woman and received a sentence of 45-day incarceration. The defense was once more financed by Cercoa. Peculiarly, Sharif was not dismissed by the company until 1982.

After his dismissal, he moved to Gainesville, Florida. He remarried, but after he had beaten his wife unconscious, he was soon served with divorce papers. On 17 March 1983, Sharif was charged with sexual assault for the third time. His constant ploy was to offer a woman a job to be his housekeeper, thereby luring the victim into his home. He then proceeded to rape, beat, and threaten her with violence. The victim managed to escape and report him. In 1984, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

After spending only five years in prison, Sharif was released in 1989. He did not get deported back to Egypt despite the judge ruling in this favor. That same year, he moved to Midland, Texas and was hired by the transnational company, Benchmark Research and Technology. In 1991, he was arrested for drunk driving, and in 1993, he committed sexual assault again. His fee for the defense was provided by Benchmark Research and Technology. He was released on parole with the condition that he never set foot on American soil again. This was the prompt for him to move over to Ciudad Juárez but he still remained as an employee of Benchmark Research and Technology.

The charges filed against him in the United States were the following:

* Joanne Collins Poldesmink (3 March 1981 in North Palm Beach, Florida), to whom he was verbally abusive. Collins filed legal charges against Sharif, which she later dropped.
* Janet Stroven, whom he met in a hotel bar during a chemist convention. Stroven filed sexual assault charges against Sharif.
* Molly Fleming (2 May 1981), a neighbor who accused Sharif of drugging and sexually assaulting her. He was given 5 years of conditional release.
* Susan Wait is a student who lived in Sharif&#x27;s home. She accused him of assault and the police arrested him for this and for transferring his parole from a previous incident. He was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison for only five years and four months. While imprisoned he taught chemistry to his fellow inmates.
* Nancy Díaz from (Midland, Texas) accused Sharif of sexual assault. Charges were later dropped.

Because of these charges, Sharif was deported from the United States.

===Murders===
Sharif&#x27;s first murder was alleged to have occurred in Mexico in March 1995. But there were indications that suggest he was molded into the serial killer profile by the Chihuahua Attorney General&#x27;s Office merely as a scapegoat. There were some suspicions that he may have begun killing while residing in Pennsylvania, from 1978 to 1981, where the unresolved disappearances of several women occurred. However, it was then established that Sharif was not connected to these events.

Upon his arrival in Mexico in 1994, Sharif stayed in the luxurious and exclusive Rinconadas de San Marcos neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez, with all-expense paid for by the company he was working for. Sharif was known to be a distinguished and brilliant chemist and during this time, he patented 25 chemical formulas. Somewhere between 1994 and 1995 was when it was presumed that he started his prolific career as a serial killer.

==Detention, trial and conviction==
On 3 October 1995, Sharif was once again reported to authorities by a sex worker for sexual assault. Nineteen-year-old Blanca Estela Díaz was kidnapped and held for three days, during which time she was beaten, raped, and threatened with violence. The charges were dismissed on the grounds that, contrary to her claims, there were no signs of sexual abuse. However, the Chihuahua government was being pressured to find the perpetrator of the Ciudad Juárez femicides in Lote Bravo. Sharif, with his criminal background, was the ideal suspect for the serial killings. The Chihuahua Attorney General&#x27;s Office actively sought to establish him as responsible for the series of homicides.

Within 20 minutes of his release, Sharif was apprehended for the disappearance of Elizabeth Castro García, a 17-year-old female with whom Sharif was said to have an intimate relationship. Garcia&#x27;s sister, Eunice, had reported her disappearance on 15 August 1995.

A dead woman who matched Castro&#x27;s description was found buried in the desert of Lote Bravo. Elizabeth Castro Garcia was later found alive and the body was that of Silvia Rivera Salas, who had disappeared in March 1995. Eyewitnesses said Salas had been kidnapped by two people in a van.

Sharif was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison for the death of Silvia Rivera Salas. The new criminal proceeding accused him of murdering 17 other women.

While he was in prison, the bodies of women who were raped and murdered were found in different areas of Ciudad Juárez. The authorities portrayed him to the media as a psychopathic rapist and killer, who remotely orchestrated the murders while in prison.

==Controversy==
===Scapegoat===
In Ciudad Juárez, Sharif was known as a rapist with a long history of assaulting women, so it wasn&#x27;t that difficult to suspect that he was also responsible for the murders that were occurring in the area. In addition to the prosecution and the Chihuahuan government, the people believed that there was a sole perpetrator. This claim reassured the families of the murdered women of the impending justice. The international press focused on the fact that although Sharif did not speak Spanish, he was a foreigner with no family and a history of sexual assault charges. For them, he was the right person to point to as the killer. Hoping to spare himself from prison time, Sharif requested an audience with the media. It would be at this point he would reveal knowledge of the real murderers and despite his scarce Spanish, he conveyed the names of Alejandro and Melchor Máynez to the press.

Alejandro was known throughout Juárez as the adopted son of a prominent Juárez businessman who owned gambling houses, bars and leisure spots along the border of El Paso, Texas. Sharif purported to have met him in a bar and heard Alejandro boasting about raping and murdering girls with the help of his cousin Melchor. The authorities did initial inquiries into that information. Sharif also claimed that Maynez&#x27;s father had paid the authorities off so they won&#x27;t need to pursue the investigation further. Alejandro was never bothered again to give his version of the facts regarding the details alleged by Sharif. Sharif began to talk constantly with the media, a situation deemed inconvenient by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office in Chihuahua, so they had him relegated to Chihuahua prison, regarded as a most dangerous prison inmate. On several occasions and with all sorts of possible pretexts, they denied him the right to speak to his defense attorney.

Sharif was in jail and yet the bodies of raped and murdered young women continued to turn up.

Sharif&#x27;s defense attorney, Irene Blancas, called out the allegations absurd. She also pointed out that Sharif was under constant threat from prison inmates. The judge, in a conversation with Sharif&#x27;s lawyer, was alleged to have mentioned that the evidence presented in court wasn&#x27;t enough for a conviction. However, the judge also knew that there aren&#x27;t any satisfactory facts to warrant the case in Sharif&#x27;s favor, and that by some strange circumstances Sharif may meet his untimely demise inside prison.

Sharif did later die in prison and the authorities merely attributed it to a cardiac arrest.

===New Crimes===
While Sharif was in prison between October 1995 and April 1996, 12 more femicides were committed in the city.

In 1995, The Ciudad Juárez Rebels, were arrested and charged with murdering 17 women. In that same year, The Ruteros of Ciudad Juárez, were also arrested for the same crime. Preposterous allegations were made by the authorities. They claimed that these groups were hired by Sharif to commit the murders in order to cause distractions from the actual investigation.

In 1996, Sharif faced 17 counts of aggravated material homicide, 24 counts of intellectual homicide, dozens of charges for kidnapping, sexual assault, organized crime and illegal human trafficking.

==Death==
On June 2, 2006, Abdul Latif Sharif died, at the age of 59, in the Social Rehabilitation Center of Chihuahua.

The cause of death was cardiac arrest consistent with a hypovolemic shock generated by a chronic hemorrhage due to peptic ulcer disease. Since 2003, he had been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis subsequent to hepatitis C and alcoholic hepatitis, and a major depressive disorder. These were at least the stated cause of death according to the authorities. Sharif proclaimed his innocence until his last dying breath.

Since there were no relatives to claim and repatriate his body, his remains were buried in Mexico. His funeral was attended by the Egyptian consul in Mexico, Karim El Sadat.

To this day the body count continues as the bodies of femicide victims continue to surface. The bodies still bear the mark of the same modus operandi from the time the murders started in the early 1990s.

<text>The city of Chihuahua or Chihuahua City ( ; Lipan: ) is the state capital of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. , the city of Chihuahua had a population of 925,762 inhabitants. while the metropolitan area had a population of 988,065 inhabitants.

Among cities in Mexico, the city of Chihuahua is highly ranked in human and social development. According to a UNDP report on human development, Chihuahua municipality&#x27;s HDI is 0.842 as of 2020 – among the highest in the country, only after municipalities in the Monterrey and Mexico City areas. IMCO ranks Chihuahua as one of the six cities with very high urban competitiveness The city was named capital of Mexico for a brief amount of time in 1864 by Benito Juarez during the second French intervention of Mexico.

The predominant activity is industry, including domestic heavy, light industries, consumer goods production, and to a smaller extent &quot;maquiladoras&quot;. The city is served by the General Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport.

== History ==
It has been said that the name derives from the Nahuatl language, meaning &quot;between two waters&quot;; other accepted definitions are &quot;place of the holed-rock&quot; or from Tarahumara, &quot;dry and sandy place&quot;. The name itself is older than the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The city was founded on October 12, 1709, by Blas Cano de los Rios and Antonio Deza y Ulloa, a Spanish explorer, as El Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar. Don Ildefonso de Irigoyen donated the land for the city foundation. The town was erected a Villa in 1718 (or 1715) with the name of San Felipe el Real de Chihuahua, and the name was shortened in 1823.

The location was chosen because it is the intersection of the rivers Chuviscar and Sacramento. It is also the midpoint between the Río Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande) and the then-important mining city of Hidalgo del Parral. For much of the 18th century, Chihuahua served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya because most governors preferred to reside there rather than in Durango, the capital of the province at that time.

Just as in other parts of Northern Mexico, Roman Catholic missionaries were an important influence during the colonial era, and the city became a meeting point for missionaries heading to and from the &#x27;sierra&#x27;, the mountainous region in western Chihuahua State where the native Tarahumara still live.

During the War of Independence, the city saw little action. However, it was in Chihuahua where Miguel Hidalgo, considered the Father of the Country, was held prisoner in the Federal Palace of Chihuahua and executed in 1811 at the nearby Government Palace by the Spaniards.

During the Mexican–American War, Chihuahua fell to U.S. forces in 1847, after the Mexican Army was defeated at the Battle of the Sacramento, north of the city.

During the French invasion, President Benito Juárez made the city the seat of his government-in-exile from 1864 to 1867. During the presidency of Porfirio Díaz the city experienced explosive growth and became one of the most important cities in Mexico. The city became the seat for important banks and wealthy families.

The city was more involved during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1917), for it became at times the operations base for the División del Norte, the army led by Pancho Villa. Many sites and memories remain of the Revolutionary era; the most important of these is the Historical Museum of the Mexican Revolution at Villa&#x27;s former estate house near downtown Chihuahua. La Quinta Luz was turned into a museum by his widow, Sra. María Luz Corral de Villa, and is now managed by the federal government.

During the 20th century, the city grew in population and learned to take advantage of its proximity with the U.S. border. Until the establishment of foreign manufacturing plants in the 1970s, the city was largely a trade post for cattle and agricultural products. During the 1990s the city grew dramatically economically, becoming the third wealthiest municipality (per capita) in the republic, after Benito Juárez borough of the Federal District (Mexico City), and San Pedro Garza García in Nuevo León.

In 2002, Mayor Jorge Barousse Moreno from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) died and was succeeded by Alejandro Cano Ricaud. During Cano&#x27;s administration, the city experienced dramatic growth in the security sector when the Police Department was certified by the ISO and surveillance aircraft bought.

Between 2002 and 2005, the city experimented with the introduction of certain new commercial innovations, like the first large mall in the city, Plaza del Sol, and the rise of the commercial Zone of the Sun, all along the Periférico de la Juventud, one of the main thoroughfares in the city.

In 2004 Juan Blanco Zaldívar, of the National Action Party (PAN), won the election for mayor (municipal president) of the city for the term 2004–2007. Since 2005, the International Festivals of Chihuahua have been celebrated by both the state and city governments during the months of September/October with art shows, plays, stage presentations and concerts by such bands as America, Foreigner, Creedence and Los Lobos being held at venues throughout the city.

Elections for mayor for the term 2007–2010 were held at the beginning of July 2007; Carlos Borruel Baquera of the PAN defeated former mayor Alejandro Cano Ricaud (PRI) by less than one-quarter of a percentage point of almost 200,000 votes cast. The turnout of registered voters, at about 41%, was the lowest in years.

In January, 2010, Mayor Carlos Borruel submitted his resignation in order to campaign for election to the office of Governor of Chihuahua. His deputy, Lic. Alvaro Guillermo Madero Muñoz, assumed the office of mayor for the balance of his term. On July 4, 2013,
Javier Garfio Pacheco of the PRI won election for a 3-year term as mayor.

In December 2015, Eugenio Baeza Fares assumed office as mayor of the City of Chihuahua, after Javier Garfio Pacheco requested licence to pursue the possibility to become the candidate for the political party PRI to Governor of the State of Chihuahua. After Garfio lost his bid for Governor Candidate, he returned and ended his period as mayor.

In July 2016, María Eugenia Campos Galván (PAN) was elected mayor. She was elected Governor of Chihuahua in 2021.
===Foundation===
The origin of the city of Chihuahua begins with the discovery of the nearby mines and foundation of the population of Santa Eulalia in 1652 by Spanish captain Diego del Castillo, however; due to the climate and constant attacks of the indigenous people the exploitation was suspended and Santa Eulalia remained several years uninhabited. Some fifty years later, in 1707, more wealthy mining discoveries were made, leading to the immediate population of Santa Eulalia and its prosperity.

However, Santa Eulalia is located in the middle of a mountain range and the difficult terrain hindered the construction and expansion of the city; because of this, when in 1709 the governor of Nueva Vizcaya, Antonio de Deza y Ulloa, with the instruction to found the head of the Real de Minas visited the population, decided to convene 16 notable neighbors (miners, traders, government officials and priests) to resolve with them the desirability of setting up Santa Eulalia herself at the head of the Royal de Minas or founding for them a new population in the nearby valley where the rivers converged Rio Chuvíscar&#x27; Chuvíscar and Sacramento.

On 12 October 1709 the vote of the notables was held on the founding of the Royal de Minas, eight of them voted for establishment in Santa Eulalia itself, while the remaining eight did so for foundation in the valley. Faced with the tie, the governor Deza and Ulloa intervened with his deciding vote for foundation in the valley of the junta de los ríos; this is what is seen as the official foundation of Chihuahua and Antonio Deza and Ulloa as its founder. The new Real de Minas was founded under the name of &quot;Real de Minas de San Francisco de Cuéllar&quot; in honor of the then Viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva Enríquez, 10th. Duke of Alburquerque and Marquis de Cuéllar.

===Spanish Colony===
The growth of the Real de Minas, driven by mines and activity of the surrounding farms continued during the colony; because of this on October 1, 1718, it stands at the Royal of San Francisco de Cuéllar in Villa, with the name of &quot;San Felipe el Real de Chihuahua&quot;&#x27;; Saint Philip in honor of the king Felipe V of Spain and being used for the first time the name of Chihuahua. At this time it is also solved the construction of a parish temple worthy for the village, to that end, the city council decided to impose a special tax on silver extracted from the mines of Santa Eulalia and with it was built the temple that today is the Catedra Scun. By the year 1786 the Villa de Chihuahua was a Mayor&#x27;s and on April 1, 1797, the first census was lifted in the city of Chihuahua by Don Fructuoso Simón de Herrera with the following summary: 324 men, 396 women, total 720 inhabitants.

In the 18th century, an aqueduct with quarry arches pouring water into a fountain in the main square was built in the city. Then elegant houses appeared, some with wooden floors worked with rich woods brought from the mountains; these houses had orchards with fruit trees and vegetables, chicken coops and smaller cattle. Wealthy miners like the Irigoyen and Carbonel decorated their mansions with luxurious furniture, magnificent paintings, silverware and beautiful porcelain. In the name of the king of Spain came the &quot;visitors&quot; to investigate the morality and justice of the kingdoms and to collect taxes. They read heralds through the streets, which enacted good treatment of indigenous people; Despite this they were confined and restricted by their freedom, always being under the rule of the Spaniards, Creoles and mestizos. With this mixture of races he was writing, over the centuries, the history of the capital.
As in other parts of northern Mexico, the peregrinos Catholicism greatly influenced the colonial era, and the city became a meeting point for pilgrims on their way to &quot;La Sierra&quot;, a mountainous region in which the indigenous people had not yet converted to Catholicism.

Also built in the city was a college run by the Society of Jesus, which built a solid building on the east end of the village, later and after the expulsion of the Jesuits, the school building was used as a barracks, prison and mint.

===Independence===

The information on the beginning of the Independence of Mexico movement took a long time to reach the then Villa de Chihuahua, where in practice it had no effect, because of this The Realists decided that the trial of the insurgents apprehended in Acatita de Baján will be held in Chihuahua. On April 23 the prisoners entered Chihuahua to be tried and on June 26 the insurgents Ignacio Allende, Mariano Jiménez, Juan Aldama and Manuel Santamaría are shot in the convent of San Francisco. On 30 July, don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was shot in the courtyards of the military hospital, a place formerly the convent of Loreto. During the rest of the war of independence the situation in Chihuahua was practically identical and without any shock.

Once independence was consummated through the Treaties of Cordoba, and after the ephemeral First Mexican Empire, on 19 July 1823 the Union Congress issued a decree dividing the former province of the New Biscay in two, the Province of Durango and the Province of Chihuahua, and pointed by capital of the latter to the Villa of San Felipe el Real de Chihuahua, which from that moment was erected in city, and was called &quot;Chihuahua&quot;&#x27;.

===Post-Independent time===
During the Mexican–American War, Chihuahua was occupied by a column of the U.S. Army under Alexander Doniphan, who came from [New Mexico], had previously occupied Santa Fe and El Paso. For the defense of Chihuahua, the Battle of Sacramento, on February 28, 1847, was enlisted with the invaders, with the full defeat of Mexican forces dispersed, the state government moved to Parral and March 1 the U.S. military occupied the city.
On March 7, 1848, the second occupation of the Anglo-Americans occurred and Governor Trías evacuated Chihuahua and was occupied by the invading chief Sterling Price. This situation lasted until 25 July, when the capital was evicted by the invaders. The legitimate authorities resettled in their official residence on 14 August of the same year.

===La Reforma===
On January 4, 1858, within the War of Reformation, which generally dominated the liberal party with the exception of two short seasons in which the conservatives occupied the capital by armed hands, Lieutenant Colonel Bruno Arriada and Mr. Juan N. Bárcenas seduced the garrison forces, proclaimed the Tacubaya Plan and set a half-hour deadline for the governor, Mr. Antonio Ochoa, to sign his accession. He retired to Aldama, gathered the national guard under the command of Colonel José Esteban crowned and the next 19 recaptured the capital.

On May 5, 1862, Don Mariano Sáenz built at his expense the first building specifically intended for theater, was called &quot;Teatro de Zaragoza&quot;, was located in the street of La Libertad, near the current Plaza de Merino and premiered with the play &quot;Los French in Mexico.&quot; On September 15, 1877, it was inaugurated by the governor of the state, General Angel Trías the &quot;Teatro Betancourt&quot;, located in the street of La Libertad, built by the Jalisciense Don Miguel Betancourt, who was located in Chihuahua for more than twenty years. With a celebration of the &quot;Scream of Independence&quot;, it lasted until May 27, 1904, when it was destroyed by fire. The &quot;Coronado Theatre&quot; opens, which was in ojinaga street and also disappeared from a fire. Mr. Betancourt built it.
On 12 October 1864, the head of the Federal Executive Power, Mr. Benito Juárez, arrived in the city on the occasion of the events of the French intervention and the empire. He was accompanied by his Secretaries of State, dispatched to the official residence of the state government. It remained until August 5, 1865, when it took the northern way; returned to the capital on 20 November and returned to the border on 9 December. The last season remained in Chihuahua from 17 June to 10 December 1866. At this time the 3 ships that overlook the now Victoria Street, part of the Municipal Palace, were sold to support the expenses demanded by the movement of troops on the occasion of the departure of President Juárez and his Ministers in the direction of Paso del Norte.

At the time of the Reformation it was in fact, for two years, capital of the Republic and seat of the Federal Powers, as the former Government Palace, today Museo Casa Juárez, became from 1864 to 1866, the National Palace and the residence of President Benito Juáre z and their ministers.

On March 25, 1866, a battle was set in the Plaza de Armas, the French imperialists were quartered in the Cathedral and General Terrazas was moving through Victoria and Independence streets, it was practically impossible to enter the cathedral, until it was decided that it would be cannoned and from Coronado and Ocampo streets they did, the 8 kg bullet. weight fell just in the bell breaking it in half, after this fact the French went out to surrender and recovered the city. The bell was declared by the city hall historical monument and still today can be seen inside Cathedral.

===Porfirian era===
In 1875, the images began to be reproduced on paper or cardboard, based on the daguerreotype, and because in 1863 the Anglo-American Henry W. Barquer was established and on March 2, 1876, the telegraph was inaugurated in the short stretch between the government house (J street) not uarez. 321) and the stage station called &quot;La Despedida&quot; (Bolívar and 10a walk) On April 23, the service between Chihuahua and Rosales was inaugurated and in August 1877 with Mexico City. The city&#x27;s first telegraphist was named Francisco Hernández.

On June 2, 1876, Colonel Angel Trías rebelled in favor of the Tuxtepec Plan, seize the capital and take the constitutional governor, Lic. Antonio Ochoa, prisoner. The term-appointed surrogate, Manuel de Herrera, dispatched successively in Cusihuiriachi, Guerrero and Camargo, raised the national guard and joined the government troops. Defeated by the Porphyrists at the Avalos ranch on 19 September, the legitimate authorities resumed the exercise of their duties in the capital.

On February 6, 1877, General Juan B. Camaño, at the head of a Tuxtepecana brigade, occupied the capital, deposed the constitutional authorities, assumed the political and military command of the state and began the new era.

On May 5, 1881, the first telephone line was inaugurated by Félix Francisco Maceyra, manager of Banco Mexicano. This line was between the bank offices, corner of Independencia Avenue and Victoria Street and the address of the mint, located where the Federal Palace is located. Three years later there were a hundred and fifty urban service aircraft and the long-distance aircraft began operating on 1 April 1930. On March 24, 1883, the first telephone communication of two populations was established, were Chihuahua and Aldama. In 1884, the Chihuahua telephone company was founded.

In 1882, as governor, General Luis Terrazas, the installation of the metal pipe was started, which gradually spread and branched. Auxiliary lime and singing ditches and piles and fountains were disappearing from the city grounds.
On September 16, 1882, the first section of the railway line, from Juárez to Chihuahua, built by Ferrocarril Central Mexicano, was inaugurated, which since 1909 belonged to the system of the National Railways of Mexico. On March 8, 1884, communication was opened to Mexico City and on the 23rd passenger and freight trains began to run.

In 1883, the first typewriters were established by the main commercial houses. They began to be used in public offices in 1891, during the local administration of Colonel Lauro Carrillo.

At the end of 1884, the first line of urban trams was inaugurated between Plaza de la Constitución and the primitive station of the National Railways. They moved by shooting beasts, then, in August 1908, they moved with electric force. They disappeared in early 1922.

In the early years of the twentieth century, in Chihuahua there was more foreign investment in non-railway enterprises than in any other region of the country, which allowed foreigners to infiltrate at all levels of local social and economic.
The population growth of the city creates the need to look for new sources to provide it with water and on September 16, 1908, the Chuvíscar dam was inaugurated, with a capacity of five million cubic meters of water, the cost was one million pesos. The preliminary study of Ing. Aguilar was taken advantage of, the final project and specifications were entrusted to the Ing. Manual Marroquín and Rivera and the construction was contracted with engineers Sheperd and Mac Quatters.
From this year the landscape of industrial boom began to blur, presenting the first signs of the economic and social crisis that was exacerbated in 1910, on the occasion of the first revolutionary outbursts. In 1911, the city was held by the &quot;rises&quot; under the command of Pascual Orozco.

===Mexican Revolution===
During the stage of the Revolution, Chihuahua was the scene of the wood movement and, later, the development of Constitutionalism and Villismo, highlighting the heroic figures of Praxedis G. Guerrero, Abraham González, Toribio Ortega, Pascual Orozco, Francisco Villa and many others.

On April 13, 1914, Don Venustiano Carranza arrived in the city of Chihuahua, from Juarez, during his crusade against the military dictatorship of General Victoriano Huerta. He was enthusiastically welcomed by the Chihuahua people, whom he greeted from the central balcony of the Government Palace announcing the social reforms demanded by the revolution and was housed in the Fifth Gameros. The next day he received the report of the governor of the state, General Manuel Chao, on the state of the public administration and the following March 3 he moved to the city of Torreón.

At the end of January 1915, General Francisco Villa, supreme head of military operations, was incommunicado with the convention government, which had had to withdraw from Mexico City towards Cuernavaca. For this reason, the expressed general issued a decree authorizing himself to assume the management of public business in the territory dominated by his forces and created three departments of state for their attention, namely the Relationships Ministry, Government and Communications, and Treasury and Development. Through these departments General Villa executed all the acts of a head of state until the end of 1915. At the end of 1915, the villist regime in the capital ended.

== Economy ==
Chihuahua is the twelfth largest city in Mexico, and one of the most industrialized. Manufacturing is very important, and there are nine major industrial parks and 79 maquila manufacturing plants, which employ about 45,000 people. The city serves as an alternative destination for maquiladora operators who require quick access to the border but wish to avoid both the higher costs and higher turnover rates of employment of the immediate border area. Of all interior (non-border) locations in Mexico, Chihuahua has the largest maquiladora presence in Mexico. Some of the larger companies include Ford Motor Co., Sumitomo Electrical, Honeywell, Hallmark, and LG Electronics.

The entire state of Chihuahua is also a thriving economic center. Chihuahua&#x27;s annual Gross State Product (GSP) is about $6.2 billion. There are more than 350 established manufacturing and assembly plants in the state; manufacturing accounts for a third of the total GSP, while trade and other services amount to 53.5%. Chihuahua has the largest amount of forested land in all of Mexico. Forty-four percent of Chihuahua&#x27;s workers are employed in commerce and services, while a little over a third of the workforce is employed in mining and industry. In mining, Chihuahua state is the leading producer in the republic of non-ferrous minerals and zinc, and is second nationwide in silver extraction. Agricultural production makes up only 6% of the total GSP; however, the state is the leading producer of apples, nuts, cattle and sheep raising nationally, and second in pine and oak trees harvested.

== Contemporary life ==

The city&#x27;s most important feature is its collection of industrial zones, in which foreign companies have manufacturing facilities, called &quot;maquiladoras&quot;, which employ thousands of people. This light industry also requires professionals, both for manufacturing and for management; this training is provided by universities such as the Universidád Autónoma de Chihuahua, the Instituto Tecnológico de Chihuahua and Instituto Tecnológico de Chihuahua II. A number of private universities also exist, to include the Chihuahua campus of ITESM.

The city&#x27;s commercial sector has also been boosted by the growth of the middle class. The wages paid by industries to management and high-level technical employees provide a cash flow unlike that of most Mexican cities.

The nightlife is lively, especially in the downtown, where some of the large, pre-revolutionary estate houses have been turned into nightclubs and dance halls, many featuring the best of Chihuahua&#x27;s live bands.

Most U.S. franchise restaurants and fast-food establishments will be found in Chihuahua, mostly on the Periferico de la Juventud, north of downtown on Universidad Avenue, or on Libertad Street Pedestrian Way in the downtown, and are patronised by the city&#x27;s youth and young professionals.

== Climate ==

Chihuahua lies on the western side of the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion and as such has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). However, it is not as hot as most of the lower elevated portions of the desert to the east owing to an altitude of almost above sea level.

Summers are hot with June being the hottest month, averaging during the day and during the night. Temperatures can easily exceed on most days and it can occasionally exceed . Most of the precipitation falls during the summer months, when the monsoon moves up northwards, causing moist air from the Gulf of California and the Gulf of Mexico to move into the city. Afternoon storms are common during the monsoon season and they can be accompanied with hail and thunderstorms. The days are still warm to hot in July and August, though slightly cooler due to the presence of the rain, with an average high of . Humidity is also higher during this time, averaging 53%.

July 1973 is the record wettest month, with . For a single day the record rainfall is on August 24, 1966. Chihuahua averages 3,081 hours of sunshine per year, ranging from a low of 217 hours in December (about 7 hours of sunshine per day) to a high of 305 hours in May (about 9.8 hours of sunshine per day).

== Geography ==

Chihuahua is best described as shaped as a large letter &quot;L&quot;, with plains to the north and hills on both sides, as well as the south; it is crossed east-and-west by Teofilo Borunda Avenue, which follows the natural flow of the Chuviscar River. Borunda is crossed in the west by the Periferico de la Juventud, a major limited-access highway running north-and-south. The main entrance to the city from the north (from the direction of Ciudad Juárez) is Tecnológico Avenue, part of the Pan-American Highway.

The geography of the city is dominated by three hills that appear in the coat of arms: Cerro Grande, Cerro Coronel and Santa Rosa, the last of which is fully covered by the city. The Cerro Grande has a monumental cross that is lighted each Christmas.

To the east and northeast, is the Sierra Nombre de Dios, across the Sacramento River from the city. Contained therein, off of Heroico Colegio Militar Ave, are the Nombre de Dios Caverns, a natural display of minerals and underground formations. To the far east and south is General Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport and the highway to the US-Mexican border crossing at Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua.

== Transportation ==

Chihuahua is served by Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport (IATA Airport code: CUU) with connections to major Mexican cities and international destinations to Denver, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix (Dec 2019). The airport serves as the state&#x27;s largest in both cargo volume and passengers and is currently being expanded accordingly.

Chihuahua is also the starting point for the Chihuahua–Pacific Railroad with a terminus in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and is also served by Ferromex, a private Mexican railroad. There is a large central depot for intercity buses in the south side of the city serving as a hub for the county&#x27;s main bus companies as well as regional, state, and international bus companies.

The city has established a BRT bus rapid-transit system known as , which currently serves the city with 1 line running 12.7 miles and 44 stations as well as dozens supplementary lines that extend into suburbs. The city&#x27;s government, in cooperation with the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, has started construction for two more central bus lines running the length of the Periférico de la Juventud and the Avenida 20 de Noviembre/Avenida Flores Magon, with several more stations that will be completed in 2019. Metrobus Chihuahua payment has been upgraded to be charged electronically through special swipe cards sold at each station. In 2018, the city government announced plans to provide free Wifi to all 44 stations, as part of an initiative to make Internet access more equitable.

The system of avenues and main streets in the city is being constantly revamped, with the construction of new roads and bridges to handle the ever-increasing traffic. Alongside numerous taxi companies, Chihuahua is host to both Uber and DiDi, private on-demand ride-sharing car services.

Important highways that run through Chihuahua are Highway 45, which connects Chihuahua to Ciudad Juárez to the north and Delicias to the south, and highway 16, which connects Chihuahua to Hermosillo to the west and to the border town of Ojinaga to the east.

== Crime ==
The city had a serious problem with property crime, especially theft and graffiti by taggers. Also, drug-related murders, including murders of law-enforcement officers (38 in 2007 according to a March 2008 issue of the newspaper &quot;Diario de Chihuahua&quot;) by traffickers led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera (&quot;el Chapo&quot;, or &quot;Shorty&quot;), have been on the rise. The federal police and the army have moved into the city to conduct anti-drug operations; it seems that their activity may have a positive effect; the indices of property crime and murder have fallen since 2010, with the result that Chihuahua is safer now than in years past.

== Sports ==

The city is home of the Dorados de Chihuahua of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, or National Professional Basketball League of Mexico. The city formerly had a baseball franchise in the Mexican League (AAA), also known as the Dorados.

On May 15 &amp; 16, 2010 the city also hosted the 24th IAAF World Race Walking Cup with $122,500 in prize money awarded in the team and individual competitions to the world&#x27;s fastest walkers at distances ranging from , plus a race for juniors, aged 16 to 19 years of age.

The city also hosts the Chihuahua Savage, a team in the United States-based Major Arena Soccer League. The team was founded in 2019 and originally played in the minor league Major Arena Soccer League 2.

== Tourism ==
The city of Chihuahua has a number of tourist sites, including the museums in Chihuahua, the baroque Metropolitan Cathedral, seat of the Archdiocese (and the resting place of St Peter of Jesus Maldonado, a Cristero martyr of the 1930s), dating from the 18th century, the Government Palace from the early 19th century, and the City Hall from the turn of the 20th century, on the Plaza de Armas across from the cathedral.

During the French invasion and the Second Empire, which ended with the execution of the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian in 1867, the constitutional president, Benito Juárez García traveled the country, searching for support wherever he could. He found it in 1864 when he settled his cabinet and government-in-exile here in the city at the address now known as Ave. Juárez 321, and incidentally, making Chihuahua the only city, aside from Mexico City, to be the capital of the Republic. The Museo Casa Juarez, now known as &quot;The Museum of Republican Loyalty&quot;, has been faithfully restored to the appearance it had when President Juárez lived here from 1864 through 1866.

The city offers the service of the touristic &quot;Trolley el Tarahumara&quot; which is a tourist bus that goes around to all the main museums and monuments in the downtown (starting its route at the Plaza de Armas), including parks like the &quot;Central Park &quot;El Palomar&quot;&quot;, a large park that has a collection of sculptures, including one depicting three doves (palomas, hence the park&#x27;s name) and a monumental flagpole, flying one of the largest flags in the Republic, as well as a statue of one of Chihuahua&#x27;s favourite sons, actor Anthony Quinn, in his role as &#x27;Zorba the Greek&#x27;, as well as many others. The city is known for its classical and modern sculpture, as seen on any main boulevard or avenue. Included are works by Espino, Baltazar, Ponzanelli and Sebastian, the latter being a native of Chihuahua.


Particularly noteworthy are the murals in the Government Palace and the &quot;Paraninfo&quot;, or University Auditorium (in the Literary and Scientific Institute building) both depicting the history of the State of Chihuahua, and both fronting
upon the &quot;Plaza Hidalgo&quot; in the downtown, and catter-cornered from the Plaza Mayor. Also of note is the &quot;Quinta Gameros&quot;, one of the largest estate houses in pre-revolutionary Chihuahua City, now the state museum for the decorative arts, and the former Federal Palace of Chihuahua on Venustiano Carranza Street, north of the Government Palace, which is now a museum and contains the cell in which Miguel Hidalgo spent his final days, and is a national shrine.

The &quot;Mammoth Museum&quot;, at Gomez Morin (also Calle 27a) and Ave. Juarez, is the city
natural history museum and contains 13 halls detailing prehistoric life from the dinosaurs through the reign of the mammals, or the Cenozoic Era. It also has exhibits of prehistoric art. The &quot;Semilla&quot; Museo Centro de Ciencia y Tecnología, or &quot;Seed Centre Museum of Science and Technology&quot;, on Teofilo Borunda and Lisboa in the downtown, is a creative learning centre and interactive science museum for children.

The Feria (Fair) of Santa Rita, known throughout the Republic, is held during the last two weeks of May and features internationally known recording artists in concert. The fair has been held annually for decades. In addition, the university symphony performs at the Paraninfo weekly during the summer months, and features international guest artists in classical and pop concerts. The Plaza de Toros &quot;La Esperanza&quot;, or bull ring, &#x27;La Esperanza&#x27; is located on Teofilo Borunda on the north side of the river, and features corridas (bullfights) during the summer and fall.

The Plaza Mayor is an important square in the downtown that displays fountains, green spaces and a collection of monuments depicting local heroes. The main monument in the Plaza Mayor is the &quot;Ángel de la Libertad&quot; that was built in 2003 representing the freedom of all Mexicans, especially Chihuahua&#x27;s people. It was inaugurated during the Independence Day festivities on September 15 of that same year. The angel has a sword with a laser light at the tip, and is capable of rotating 360° over its axis.

<text>Restrepia muscifera, commonly known as the fly-carrying restrepia, is a species of orchid.

The epithet &#x27;muscifera&#x27; is a Latin word, meaning &#x27;fly bearing&#x27;. This is an allusion to the appearance of the flower.

It is a tiny cespitose orchid, occurring from southern Mexico to Colombia, and a few scattered spots in Peru, found in tropical and montane rainforests at altitudes between 300 and 2,400 m.

This epiphytic orchid lacks pseudobulbs. The single, erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape. The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.

The flowers develop one at a time at the base of the leaf and reach a length of about 2.3 cm. They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf.

The long dorsal sepal is erect, almost translucent white with dark red dots and ends in a somewhat thicker, yellow club-shaped tip, with minute magenta dots. They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals) with a length of about 2.5 cm and a small split at the end.

These are quite colorful: overall almost translucent white, overlaid with contrasting reddish-purple dots in an ovate line pattern. The long, lateral petals also end in a thickened, yellow club-shaped tip.

The shorter, smooth lip is ovate. It shows the same variations of dark red with magenta dots.

<text>The term &quot;Soviet empire&quot; collectively refers to the world&#x27;s territories that the Soviet Union dominated politically, economically, and militarily. This phenomenon, particularly in the context of the Cold War, is used by Sovietologists to describe the extent of the Soviet Union&#x27;s hegemony over the Second World.

In a wider sense, the term refers to Soviet foreign policy during the Cold War, which has been characterized as imperialist: the nations which were part of the &quot;Soviet empire&quot; were nominally independent countries with separate governments that set their own policies, but those policies had to stay within certain limits decided by the Soviet Union. These limits were enforced by the threat of intervention by Soviet forces, and later the Warsaw Pact. Major military interventions took place in East Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Poland in 1980–81 and Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. Countries in the Eastern Bloc were considered Soviet satellite states.

== Characteristics ==
Although the Soviet Union was not ruled by an emperor, and declared itself anti-imperialist and a people&#x27;s democracy, it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. The notion of &quot;Soviet empire&quot; often refers to a form of &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;colonial&quot; empire with communism only replacing conventional imperial ideologies such as Christianity or monarchy, rather than creating a revolutionary state. Academically the idea is seen as emerging with Richard Pipes&#x27; 1957 book &quot;The Formation of the Soviet Union: Communism and Nationalism, 1917–1923&quot;; it has been reinforced, along with several other views, in continuing scholarship. Several scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. The Soviet Union practiced colonialism similar to conventional imperial powers.

The Soviets pursued internal colonialism in Central Asia. For example, the state&#x27;s prioritized grain production over livestock in Kyrgyzstan, which favored Slavic settlers over the Kyrgyz natives, thus perpetuating the inequalities of the tsarist colonial era. The Maoists argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade, or social imperialism. While Maoists criticized post-Stalin USSR&#x27;s imperialism from a hardline communist viewpoint, reformist socialist critics of Soviet imperialism, such as Josip Broz Tito and Milovan Djilas, have referred the Stalinist USSR&#x27;s foreign policies, such as the occupation and economic exploitations of Eastern Europe and its aggressive and hostile policy towards Yugoslavia as Soviet imperialism. Another dimension of Soviet imperialism is cultural imperialism, the Sovietization of culture and education at the expense of local traditions. Leonid Brezhnev continued a policy of cultural Russification as part of Developed Socialism, which sought to assert more central control. Seweryn Bialer argued that the Soviet state had an imperial nationalism.

A notable wave of Sovietization occurred during the Russian Civil War in the territories captured by the Red Army. Later, the territories occupied by the Russian SFSR and the USSR were Sovietized. Mongolia was invaded by the Soviet Union and Sovietized in the 1920s after it became a Soviet satellite state, and after the end of the Second World War, Sovietization took place in the countries of the Soviet Bloc (Eastern and Central Europe: Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Baltic states etc.). In a broad sense, it included the involuntary creation of Soviet-style authorities, imitation of elections held under the control of the Bolsheviks with the removal of opposition candidates, nationalization of land and property, repression against representatives of &quot;class enemies&quot; (kulaks, or &quot;osadniks&quot;, for instance). Mass executions and imprisoning in Gulag labor camps and exile settlements often accompany that process. This was usually promoted and sped up by propaganda aimed at creating a common way of life in all states within the Soviet sphere of influence. In modern history, Sovietization refers to the copying of models of Soviet life (the cult of the leader&#x27;s personality, collectivist ideology, mandatory participation in propaganda activities, etc.).

From the 1930s through the 1950s, Joseph Stalin ordered population transfers in the Soviet Union, deporting people (often entire nationalities) to underpopulated remote areas, with their place being taken mostly by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians. The policy officially ended in the Khrushchev era, with some of the nationalities allowed to return in 1957. However, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev refused the right of return for Crimean Tatars, Russian Germans and Meskhetian Turks. In 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Russia declared the Stalinist mass deportations to be a &quot;policy of defamation and genocide&quot;.

The historical relationship between Russia (the dominant republic in the Soviet Union) and these Eastern European countries helps explain their longing to eradicate the remnants of Soviet culture. Poland and the Baltic states epitomize the Soviet attempt to build uniform cultures and political systems. According to Dag Noren, Russia was seeking to constitute and reinforce a buffer zone between itself and Western Europe so as to protect itself from potential future attacks from hostile Western European countries. The Soviet Union had lost approximately 20 million people over the course of the Second World War, although Russian sources are keen on further inflating that figure. To prevent a recurrence of such costly warfare, Soviet leaders believed that they needed to establish a hierarchy of political and economic dependence between neighboring states and the USSR.

During the Brezhnev era, the policy of &quot;Developed Socialism&quot; declared the Soviet Union to be the most complete socialist country—other countries were &quot;socialist&quot;, but the USSR was &quot;&quot;developed&quot; socialist&quot;—explaining its dominant role and hegemony over the other socialist countries. This and the interventionist Brezhnev Doctrine, permitting the invasion of other socialist countries, led to characterisation of the USSR as an empire.

Soviet influence in the &quot;socialist-leaning countries&quot; was mainly political and ideological rather than economically exploitative: the Soviet Union pumped enormous amounts of &quot;international assistance&quot; into them in order to secure influence, ultimately to the detriment of its own economy. The Soviet Union sought a group of countries which would rally to its cause in the event of an attack from Western countries, and support it in the context of the Cold War. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation was recognized as its successor state, inheriting $103 billion of Soviet foreign debt and $140 billion of Soviet assets abroad.

Economic expansion did, however, play a significant role in Soviet motivation to spread influence in its satellite territories. These new territories would ensure an increase in the global wealth which the Soviet Union would have a grasp on.

Soviet officials from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic intertwined this economic opportunity with a potential for migration. They saw in these Eastern European countries the potential of a great workforce. They offered a welcome to them upon the only condition that they work hard and achieve social success. This ideology was shaped on the model of the meritocratic, 19th-century American foreign policy.

=== Formal or informal empire? ===
Scholars discussing Soviet empire have discussed it as a formal empire or informal empire. In a more formal interpretation of &quot;Soviet empire&quot;, this meant absolutism, resembling Lenin&#x27;s description of the tsarist empire as a &quot;prison of the peoples&quot; except that this &quot;prison of the peoples&quot; had been actualized during Stalin&#x27;s regime after Lenin&#x27;s death. Thomas Winderl wrote &quot;The USSR became in a certain sense more a prison-house of nations than the old Empire had ever been.&quot;

Another view sees the Soviet empire as constituting an &quot;informal empire&quot; over nominally sovereign states in the Warsaw Pact due to Soviet pressure and military presence. The Soviet informal empire depended on subsidies from Moscow. The informal empire in the wider Warsaw Pact also included linkages between Communist Parties. Some historians consider a more multinational-oriented Soviet Union emphasizing its socialist initiatives, such as Ian Bremmer, who describes a &quot;matryoshka-nationalism&quot; where a pan-Soviet nationalism included other nationalisms. Eric Hobsbawn argued that the Soviet Union had effectively designed nations by drawing borders. Dmitri Trenin wrote that by 1980, the Soviet Union had formed both a formal and informal empire.

The informal empire would have included Soviet economic investments, military occupation, and covert action in Soviet-aligned countries. The studies of informal empire have included Soviet influence on East Germany and 1930s Xinjiang. From the 1919 Karakhan Manifesto to 1927, diplomats of the Soviet Union would promise to revoke concessions in China, but the Soviets secretly kept tsarist concessions such as the Chinese Eastern Railway, as well as consulates, barracks, and churches. After the Sino-Soviet conflict (1929), the Soviet Union regained the Russian Empire&#x27;s concession of the Chinese Eastern Railway and held it until its return to China in 1952.

Alexander Wendt suggested that by the time of Stalin&#x27;s Socialism in one country alignment, socialist internationalism &quot;evolved into an ideology of control rather than revolution under the rubric of socialist internationalism&quot; internally within the Soviet Union. By the start of the Cold War it evolved into a &quot;coded power language&quot; that was once again international, but applied to the Soviet informal empire. At times the USSR signaled toleration of policies of satellite states indirectly, by declaring them consistent or inconsistent with socialist ideology, essentially recreating a hegemonic role. Wendt argued that a &quot;hegemonic ideology&quot; could continue to motivate actions after the original incentives were removed, and argued this explains the &quot;zeal of East German Politburo members who chose not to defend themselves against trumped-up charges during the 1950s purges.&quot;

Analyzing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Koslowski and Kratochwil argued that a postwar Soviet &quot;formal empire&quot; represented by the Warsaw Pact, with Soviet military role and control over of member states&#x27; foreign relations, had evolved into an informal suzerainty or &quot;Ottomanization&quot; from the late 1970s to 1989. With Gorbachev&#x27;s relinquishing of the Brezhnev Doctrine in 1989, the informal empire reduced in pressure to a more conventional sphere of influence, resembling Finlandization but applied to the erstwhile East Bloc states, until the Soviet fall in 1991. By contrast &quot;Austrianization&quot; would have been a realist model of great power politics by which the Soviets would have hypothetically relied on Western guarantees to keep an artificial Soviet sphere of influence. The speed of reform in the 1989 to 1991 period made both a repeat of Finlandization and Austrianization impossible for the Soviet Union.

== Communist states aligned with the Soviet Union ==
=== Warsaw Pact ===
These countries were the closest allies of the Soviet Union and were also members of the Comecon, a Soviet-led economic community founded in 1949. The members of the Warsaw Pact, sometimes called the Eastern Bloc, were widely viewed as Soviet satellite states. These countries were occupied (or formerly occupied) by the Red Army, and their politics, military, foreign and domestic policies were dominated by the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact included the following states:
* People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania (1946–1968) 
* People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990)
* Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948–1990)
* German Democratic Republic (1949–1990)
* Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic (1949–1989)
* Polish People&#x27;s Republic (1947–1989)
* Socialist Republic of Romania (1947–1960s)

In addition to having a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, the Soviet Union had two of its union republics in the United Nations General Assembly:
*

=== Other Marxist–Leninist states ===
These countries were Marxist-Leninist states who were allied with the Soviet Union, but were not part of the Warsaw Pact. 
* Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–1991)

* People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo (1969–1991)
* Republic of Cuba (1959–1991)
* Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia, then People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (1974–1991)

* People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (1967–1990)
* Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–1948)

== Non-communist states aligned with the Soviet Union ==
Some countries in the Third World had pro-Soviet governments during the Cold War. In the political terminology of the Soviet Union, these were &quot;countries moving along the socialist road of development&quot; as opposed to the more advanced &quot;countries of developed socialism&quot; which were mostly located in Eastern Europe, but that also included Cuba and Vietnam. They received some aid, either military or economic, from the Soviet Union and were influenced by it to varying degrees. Sometimes, their support for the Soviet Union eventually stopped for various reasons and in some cases the pro-Soviet government lost power while in other cases the same government remained in power, but ultimately ended its alliance with the Soviet Union.

== Communist states opposed to the Soviet Union ==
Some communist states were opposed to the Soviet Union and criticized many of its policies. Although they may have had many similarities to the USSR on domestic issues, they were not considered Soviet allies in international politics. Relations between them and the Soviet Union were often tense, sometimes even to the point of armed conflict.
* Albania (1960–1983)
* Cambodia (1975–1979)
* (1961–1983)
* Romania (1960s-1983)
* Somalia (1977–1991)
* (1948–1955)

== Neutral states ==

=== Finland ===
The position of Finland was complex. The Soviet Union invaded Finland on 30 November 1939, launching the Winter War. The Soviets intended to install their Finnish Democratic Republic puppet government into Helsinki and annex Finland into the Soviet Union. Fierce Finnish resistance prevented the Soviets from achieving this objective, and the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, with hostilities ending the following day.

Finland would re-enter the Second World War when they invaded the Soviet Union alongside Germany in late June 1941. Finland reclaimed all territory lost in the Winter War, and would proceed to occupy additional territory in East Karelia. The Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive of 1944 pushed Finland out of this territory, but Finland halted the offensive at the Battle of Tali-Ihantala. The Moscow Armistice brought the Continuation War to an end. Finland retained most of its territory and its market economy, trading on the Western markets and ultimately joining the Western currency system.

Nevertheless, although Finland was considered neutral, the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 significantly limited Finnish freedom of operation in foreign policy. It required Finland to defend the Soviet Union from attacks through its territory, which in practice prevented Finland from joining NATO, and effectively gave the Soviet Union a veto in Finnish foreign policy. Thus, the Soviet Union could exercise &quot;imperial&quot; hegemonic power even towards a neutral state. Under the Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine, Finland sought to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and extensive bilateral trade developed. In the West, this led to fears of the spread of &quot;Finlandization&quot;, where Western allies would no longer reliably support the United States and NATO.

<text>The Reichstag (, ; officially: &quot;Plenarbereich&quot; , ), a historic legislative government building on Platz der Republik in Berlin, is the seat of the German Bundestag. It is also the meeting place of the Federal Convention, which elects the President of Germany.

The Neo-Renaissance building was constructed between 1884 and 1894 in the Tiergarten district on the left bank of the River Spree to plans by the architect Paul Wallot. It housed both the Reichstag legislature of the German Empire and the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. The Reich&#x27;s Federal Council also originally met there. The building was initially used by the Reichstag for Nazi Germany, but severe damage in the Reichstag fire of 1933 prevented further use and the Reichstag moved to the nearby Kroll Opera House. The 1933 fire became a pivotal event in the entrenchment of the Nazi regime. The building took further damage during World War II, and its symbolism made it an important target for the Red Army during the Battle of Berlin. 

After the war, the building was modernised and restored in the 1950s and used for exhibitions and special events, as its location in West Berlin prevented its use as a parliament building by either of the two Germanies. From 1995 to 1999, the Reichstag was fundamentally redesigned by Norman Foster for its permanent use as a parliament building in the now reunified Germany. The keys were ceremonially handed over to the President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse, on 19 April 1999. A landmark of the city is the redesigned walk-in glass dome above the plenary chamber, proposed by artist and architect Gottfried Böhm.

==Etymology==
The term , when used to connote a diet, dates back to the Holy Roman Empire. The building was built for the Diet of the German Empire, which was succeeded by the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. The latter would become the Reichstag of Nazi Germany, which left the building (and ceased to act as a parliament) after the 1933 fire and never returned, using the Kroll Opera House instead; the term has not been used by German parliaments since World War II. In today&#x27;s usage, the word (Imperial Diet) refers mainly to the building, while (Federal Diet) refers to the institution.

==History==

===Imperial and Weimar Republic eras===
Construction of the building began well after the unification of Germany in 1871. Starting in 1871, and for the next 23 years, the parliament met in the former property of the , at 4. In 1872, an architectural contest with 103 participating architects was carried out to erect a new building, a contest won by Ludwig Bohnstedt. The plan incorporated the (today&#x27;s ), which was then occupied by the palace of a Polish-Prussian aristocrat, . That property was unavailable at the time.

In 1882, another architectural contest was held, with 200 architects participating. This time, the winner—the Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot—would actually see his Neo-Baroque project executed. The direct model for Wallot&#x27;s design was Philadelphia&#x27;s Memorial Hall, the main building of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition. Wallot adorned the building&#x27;s façade with crowns and eagles symbolising imperial strength. The building&#x27;s four corner towers represented the four German kingdoms at unification, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Württemberg, and the heraldic coat of arms of each kingdom, as well as smaller devices representing various German city-states, flanked the main entrance, celebrating the process of unification. Some of the Reichstag&#x27;s decorative sculptures, reliefs, and inscriptions were by sculptor Otto Lessing.

On 29 June 1884, the foundation stone was finally laid by Wilhelm I, at the east side of the Königsplatz. Before construction was completed by Philipp Holzmann A.G. in 1894, Wilhelm I died (in 1888, the Year of Three Emperors). His eventual successor, Wilhelm II, took a more jaundiced view of parliamentary democracy than his grandfather. The original building was acclaimed for the construction of an original cupola of steel and glass, considered an engineering feat at the time. But its mixture of architectural styles drew widespread criticism.

In 1916, the iconic words (&quot;To the German People&quot;) were placed above the main façade of the building, much to the displeasure of Wilhelm II, who had tried to block the adding of the inscription for its democratic significance. During the revolutionary days of 1918, two days before World War I ended and just hours after Wilhelm&#x27;s abdication was announced, Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the institution of a republic from one of the balconies of the Reichstag building on 9 November. The building continued to be the seat of the parliament of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), which was still called the Reichstag. Up to 42 protesters died during the Reichstag Bloodbath of 13 January 1920, when workers tried to protest against a law that would restrict their rights; it was the bloodiest demonstration in German history.

===Nazi period===
On 27 February 1933, there was an arson attack on the Reichstag building, precisely four weeks after Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany. Despite the firefighters&#x27; efforts, most of the building was gutted. Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch &quot;council communist&quot;, was the apparent culprit; however, Hitler attributed the fire to Communist agitators. He used it as a pretext to claim that Communists were plotting against the German government, and induced President Paul von Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree suspending civil liberties, and pursue a &quot;ruthless confrontation&quot; with the Communists.

Following the Reichstag fire, the building was not used for parliamentary sessions for the next 12 years of Nazi rule. Instead, the nearby Kroll Opera House was modified into a legislative chamber and served as the location of all parliamentary sessions, whilst the Reichstag building became the setting for political exhibitions. In 1939, the library and archive were moved elsewhere, and the windows bricked up as the building was made into a fortress. By 1943, the building was used as a hospital, and a radio tube manufacturing facility by AEG. During the Battle of Berlin in 1945, it became one of the central targets for the Red Army to capture, due to its perceived symbolic significance.

===Cold War===
When the Cold War emerged, the building was physically within West Berlin, but in ruins. During the Berlin Blockade, an enormous number of West Berliners assembled before the building on 9 September 1948, and Mayor Ernst Reuter held a famous speech that ended with (&quot;You people of the world...look upon this city...&quot;).

In 1956, after some debate, the West German government decided that the Reichstag should not be torn down, but be restored instead under the guidance of Paul Baumgarten. The cupola of the original building, which had also been heavily damaged in the war, was dismantled, and the outside façade made simpler with the removal of ornaments and statues. Reconstruction started in 1961, and was complete by 1971.

The artistic and practical value of his work was the subject of much debate after German reunification. Under the 1971 Four Power Agreement on Berlin, Berlin was formally outside the bounds of either East or West Germany, and so the West German parliament, the , was not allowed to assemble formally in West Berlin. This prohibition was obeyed even though East Germany had declared East Berlin its capital, violating this provision. Until 1990, the building was thus used only for occasional representative meetings, and one-off events, such as a free concert given by British rock band Barclay James Harvest on 30 August 1980 and by Tangerine Dream on 29 August 1981. It was also used for a widely lauded permanent exhibition about German history called (&quot;Questions on German history&quot;).

===Reunification===
The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the Reichstag building, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Richard von Weizsäcker, former Chancellor Willy Brandt and many others. The event included huge firework displays. The following day the parliament of the united Germany assembled as a symbolic act in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of parliament, on 20 June 1991, did the conclude with quite a slim majority in favour of both government and parliament returning to Berlin from Bonn.
On 21 June 1994, Norman Foster was asked to include a dome solution in his draft reconstruction proposal, which he included in his 10 February 1995 plans.

Before reconstruction began, the Reichstag was wrapped by the Bulgarian-American artists Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude in 1995, attracting millions of visitors. The project was financed by the artists through the sale of preparatory drawings and collages, as well as early works of the 1950s and 1960s.

During the reconstruction, the building was first almost completely gutted, taking out everything except the outer walls, including all changes made by Baumgarten in the 1960s. Respect for the historic aspects of the building was one of the conditions stipulated to the architects, so traces of historical events were to be retained in a visible state. Among them were bullet holes and graffiti left by Soviet soldiers after the final battle for Berlin in April–May 1945. However, graffiti considered offensive was removed, in agreement with Russian diplomats at the time.

Reconstruction was completed in 1999, with the Bundestag convening there officially for the first time on 19 April of that year. The Reichstag is now the second most visited attraction in Germany, not least because of the huge glass dome that was erected on the roof as a gesture to the original 1894 cupola, giving an impressive view over the city, especially at night.

==Dome==
The large glass dome at the very top of the Reichstag has a 360° view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape. The main hall (debating chamber) of the parliament below can also be seen from inside the dome, and natural light from above radiates down to the parliament floor. A large sun shield tracks the movement of the sun electronically and blocks direct sunlight which would not only cause large solar gain, but dazzle those below. Construction work was finished in 1999 and the seat of parliament was transferred to the in April of that year. The dome is open to visitors by prior registration.

<text>Restrepia falkenbergii, commonly called the Falkenberg&#x27;s restrepia, is an epiphytic orchid, found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 m in Colombia.

This large orchid lacks pseudobulbs. The erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape. The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.

The flowers develop one at a time at the base of the leaf. They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf. The long dorsal sepal is erect and ends in a somewhat thicker club-shaped tip. They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals) with a length of about 2.5 cm. These are quite colorful : overall yellow, with orange, tan and red at the back, overlaid with contrasting reddish-purple stripes. The long, lateral petals equally end in a thickened club-shaped tip.

The long and smooth lip is pandurate and widest its apex. It shows the same variations in color and markings.

<text>Seahenge, also known as Holme I, was a prehistoric monument located in the village of Holme-next-the-Sea, near Old Hunstanton in the English county of Norfolk. A timber circle with an upturned tree root in the centre, Seahenge, along with the nearby timber circle Holme II, was built in the spring-summer of 2049 BC, during the early Bronze Age in Britain. Contemporary theory is that they were used for ritual purposes; in particular Holme II has been interpreted as a mortuary monument that may originally have formed the boundary of a burial mound.

In order to preserve the timber in the site from exposure to air, due to recent exposure of the remains by the sea, it was excavated in Spring 1999, and its remains taken to an archeological museum and then a maritime museum for preservation of the wood. In 1999, a reproduction was put up by some of the excavators, near the site. In 2008, after further study, a second reproduction was erected near the original&#x27;s location. Due to controversy about the excavation of Seahenge, Holme II was left in place to be monitored as it is gradually destroyed by erosion.

== Description ==
The site consisted of an outer ring comprising fifty-five small split oak trunks forming a roughly circular enclosure around . Rather than being placed in individual holes, the timbers had been arranged around a circular construction trench. Their split sides faced inwards and their bark faced outwards (with one exception where the opposite is the case). One of the trunks on the south western side had a narrow Y fork in it, permitting access to the central area. Another post had been placed outside this entrance, which would have prevented anyone from seeing inside. The timbers were set in ground to a depth of from the contemporary surface although how far they originally extended upwards is not known. In the centre of the ring was a large inverted oak stump. At the time of building, the site was surrounded by salt marshes.

Although the structure&#x27;s existence had been common knowledge amongst locals for several decades, Seahenge received its name from the press in 1998, who named it after the more famous prehistoric structure Stonehenge in Wiltshire, and was picked up by the local and national media, inducing a great deal of publicity around its excavation. This was only increased due to the protests held against the excavation by both locals, who wanted it to remain as a tourist site, and Neopagans, who believed that the removal of the structure was an insult to the religious beliefs of its original builders, among other concerns.

== Construction ==
Seahenge was constructed during the early Bronze Age, a period of time that saw the increasing adoption of agriculture and sedentary living in Britain. Those constructing the monument made use of at least fifty different bronze axes,
which were used to shape the timber to the desired lengths and shapes, at a time when, archaeologists believe, bronze tools were still relatively rare and had only been introduced into Britain a few centuries before.

Using a variety of scientific techniques, archaeologists have come to the conclusion that the trees used in the construction of the monument had all been felled in the same year, 2049 BC,
whilst the condition of the sapwood indicated that it had been cut down in spring or early summer. Oak trees would have been transported from some distance as they are not common near the site. According to writer Watson (2005) &quot;Confirming that all the trees had been felled at the same time suggested strongly that the building of the circle was a single event. Further, a great amount of work would have been involved in felling, transporting, preparing and erecting the timbers, so it was likely too that the job was done by a large number of people – possibly an entire community or an extended family – working together.&quot;

Seahenge was originally constructed on a salt marsh, and over the centuries the area became a freshwater wetland, as an offshore barrier grew up, preventing sea water from getting access to the area around the circle. This in turn allowed alder trees to grow in the area, which eventually created a layer of peat above the mudflats. With rising sea levels in later millennia, the sea advanced, and eventually sand began to cover the peat. Through this process, Seahenge eventually found itself from once being inland to being on the beach, where it was revealed by the eroding away of the sand and peat by the late 20th century, four thousand years since its original construction.

== Purpose ==
Researchers were unable to determine activity at Seahenge in the centuries after it was built, and its purpose is consequently unknown. However, the presence of Middle and Late Bronze Age pottery at the site suggests that it became a focal point again several centuries after construction. Theories about the site have focused on the idea of inversion, as represented by the upside-down central tree stump and the single post turned 180 degrees from the others, within the circle itself. The theme of inversion has been noticed in some Early Bronze Age burials. Not all the split posts can be accounted for and it has been suggested that another structure was built nearby using them.

Seahenge is so-named by analogy with Stonehenge, but Seahenge did not possess an actual henge (a monumental enclosing ditch, with a bank piled up outside of it), making it a different category of monument. It appears to have had little functionally in common with its namesake. The contemporary ground surface associated with the monument has long since been washed away: No features survive from the time it was erected, and the silt Seahenge stood in when it was found was deposited long after the timber circle was first overwhelmed by the sea.

One theory of use is that Seahenge was a mortuary enclosure for excarnation rather than a meeting-place, like a henge monument. In view of the relatively small diameter of the post circle and its height and its &quot;privacy&quot; entrance, some have suggested it is a &quot;sky burial&quot; (excarnation) site, similar in use (although different in construction) to those found in Tibet, Mongolia, Pakistan, and North America. There is no direct evidence for this.

== Discovery ==
In early Spring 1998, John Lorimer, an amateur archaeologist and beach comber, was catching shrimps with his brother-in-law Gary on Holme beach. The pair found a Bronze Age axe head in the silt, but at first did not know what it was. Intrigued, Lorimer visited the area repeatedly, eventually finding a lone tree stump that had been unearthed on the beach – unusual in that it seemed to be upside down. A metal detectorist friend later recognised the site&#x27;s importance, so they contacted the Castle Museum in Norwich. Archaeologists at the museum examined the axe head, the second one found on Holme Beach within only a few months. Lorimer continued to monitor the inverted tree stump. Wave erosion gradually exposed a surrounding ring of wooden posts, confirming that the site was an intentional human construction. Lorimer contacted Castle Museum again.

The museum contacted Edwin Rose, at the time Norfolk Landscape Archaeology&#x27;s Development Control Officer, who then visited the site with Lorimer on 12 August 1998. At first, Rose suspected it was a fish trap from the Anglo-Saxon period, relatively commonplace for the area. But he began to suspect that it might be something else. So Rose inquired whether English Heritage would fund an excavation. They agreed.

== Preliminary excavation ==
Archaeological excavation at Seahenge began October 1998, under site director Mark Brennand of the Norfolk Archaeological Unit. It proved a difficult site to excavate. Sea tides restricted trial trench excavating work to between one and four hours per day. A dendrochronological sample extracted from the stump was sent for analysis at Sheffield University. By January 1999, preliminary results indicated a Bronze Age monument. Despite projected expense, English Heritage decided full excavation would be worthwhile, because the site had begun to suffer from erosion: Sections of wood had been exposed to corrosive oxygen and salt brine after millennia protected in the mud.

== Media interest ==
Initially, there was little media interest in the excavation, with it only being reported in archaeological publications like the Council of British Archaeology&#x27;s &quot;British Archaeology&quot; magazine and a few local Norfolk-based media outlets. This changed on Saturday 9 January 1999, when &quot;The Independent&quot; ran a front-page story by environmental correspondent, Michael McCarthy, headlined &quot;Shifting sands reveal &#x27;Stonehenge of the Sea&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot;′s article sparked articles in rival newspapers, with the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; picking up the story for a two-page feature entitled &quot;Our Stonehenge Beneath the Sea&quot; on Monday 11 January. These stories repeated comparisons to Stonehenge, one of England&#x27;s most famous national treasures, despite the many differences between the two sites. Eventually the site gained the popular title of &quot;Seahenge&quot;.

Soon a great debate began in the media, with some adherents involved in the Neopagan and New Age movements arguing that they had &quot;a kind of spiritual ownership of the circle&quot;. They wanted it left &quot;in situ&quot; and opposed archaeological excavation. Local tourism organisations also wanted it left &quot;in situ&quot;, as the site was sure to attract tourism. The prospect of tourists visiting the beach to see the monument meanwhile brought criticism from local wildlife organisations such as the Norfolk Wildlife Trust, who noted how within the first three months of 1999, five thousand visitors had come to see the monument. Tourist traffic disturbed feeding wader birds in Holme Dunes National Nature Reserve.

== Excavation ==
The press were putting forward ideas of saving and preserving the monument where it was, something archaeologists explained was impossible. English Heritage&#x27;s chief archaeologist, Geoffrey Wainright, eventually gave the go ahead for a full excavation in March 1999. The procedure would cost £500,000, and the timbers would be conserved at the Fenland Archaeological Trust&#x27;s field centre at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire.

Excavation began on Wednesday 26 May 1999, by a team from Norfolk Archaeological Unit led by Mark Brennand. Again they found it a particularly daunting and difficult site, as they were only able to excavate for a few hours a day. Much of that limited time was taken up removing water that built up overnight, and fish and other animals that had set up residence there.

== Protests ==
The team also had to contend with protests mounted both by locals and by Neopagan groups led by Parish Council Chairman Geoff Needham, a former fisherman.

English Heritage had taken part in meetings with protest groups, but neither side changed their position. One of the most vocal protesters, the Neopagan and conservationist Buster Nolan, informed a reporter from the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; that &quot;Seahenge has more meaning and power on the beach here at Holme than it does anywhere else ... This is 60 grand being spent by archaeologists who are patting each other on the back, telling each other they&#x27;re doing the right thing. It&#x27;s a farce.&quot;

Nolan went on to employ some local solicitors in an attempt to get the courts to intercede on the protesters&#x27; behalf, receiving donations from the Council of British Druid Orders and from a local businessman, Mervyn Lambert, who told reporters that &quot;The people of Norfolk should have more balls ... I&#x27;m amazed they&#x27;re allowing it to happen.&quot; But solicitors refused to take up the case, believing that they could not possibly win against English Heritage.

English Heritage gained an interim injunction banning several of the most prominent protesters from the vicinity of the site, including Des Crow, Geoff Needham, Buster Nolan, and Rollo Maughfling, who at one point climbed on top of Seahenge to declare an eight-point proclamation. Needham and Maughfling however successfully contested the ban, as the court agreed that neither of them had attempted to obstruct the archaeologists&#x27; work. The publicity and controversy surrounding the excavation led the British television company to commission a special episode of their archaeological series &quot;Time Team&quot; documenting the excavation itself and staging an experimental archaeology reconstruction of the Bronze Age site.

After several weeks work, the excavators decided to physically remove the main timbers from the site, an event for which the media had been tipped off. A wide variety of protesters turned up, along with police to ensure that they did not cause trouble for the excavators. However, as the central tree stump was being pulled out by a digger, a young protester ran under the rope cordoning off the site and headed towards the excavation until she was restrained by excavators and then by police.

== Conservation ==
With Seahenge excavated, the timbers that it had been built out of were transported away to the Fenland Archaeology Trust&#x27;s field centre at Flag Fen in Cambridgeshire, where it immediately underwent conservation by being immersed in fresh water. The timbers were then cleaned of attached mud and placed in permanent storage. English Heritage employed laser scan technology (developed by Alistair Carty of Archaeoptics) to precisely image timbers in three dimensions, allowing archaeologists to create a virtual model of the whole site.
At Flag Fen, it was then continually soaked in wax-emulsified water to slowly (over years) replace the moisture in the wood with wax. Conservation included treatment with polyethylene glycol. It was later transferred to Portsmouth where maritime archaeology experts at the Mary Rose Trust continued the programme at their purpose-built site.

== Reconstruction ==
Conservation work is complete, with a reconstructed Seahenge near its original site, at the Lynn Museum and opened to the public in April 2008.

== Exhibition ==
In February 2022, timber from Holme I was displayed at &quot;The World of Stonehenge&quot; exhibition at British Museum, from 17 February 2022 until 17 July 2022.

==Holme II==
One hundred metres east, another, much larger ring was found, consisting of two concentric timber circles surrounding a hurdle-lined pit containing two oak logs. Known as Holme II, dendrochronology gives a date identical to Seahenge: 2049 BC. This is the first time that two adjacent prehistoric monuments have been shown to have been built together. Details of the construction of Holme II differ from that of Holme I (Seahenge): for instance the palisade of Holme I had the tree bark intact, while it was removed for Holme II, giving the two enclosures contrasting dark and light colours. One suggestion is that the upturned roots in Holme I were used for excarnation, while the remains were later buried in Holme II, which may have contained a burial mound (now washed away) extending to the inner timber circle which would have formed the revetment (outer securing border) of the mound.

Although also threatened with destruction by the sea, this site has been left &quot;in situ&quot; and exposed to the tidal actions of the sea. This decision by English Heritage relates to the controversy over digging Holme I.

==In popular culture==
Jean-Jacques Burnel, bassist of the Stranglers, was living in Holme-next-the-Sea at the time of the discovery. The monument inspired him to write the songs on the band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Norfolk Coast&quot;.

Seahenge provides the inspiration for a timber circle depicted in Catherine Fisher&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Darkhenge&quot;. Fisher discusses a prehistoric monument featuring an upturned oak tree surrounded by 24 timbers, each symbolising one of the characters in the ogham tree alphabet. This circle, known as Darkhenge, is described as being located at Avebury in Wiltshire and is portrayed as being the portal to Annwyn, the underworld of Welsh mythology.

Seahenge can be visited in the 2020 video game Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla.

<text>Flag Fen, east of Peterborough, England, is a Bronze Age site which was constructed about 3,500 years ago and consists of more than 60,000 timbers arranged in five very long rows, creating a wooden causeway (around long) across the wet fenland. Part-way across the structure a small island was formed. Items associated with it have led scholars to conclude that the island was of religious significance. Archaeological work began in 1982 at the site, which is located east of Fengate. Flag Fen is now part of the Greater Fens Museum Partnership. A visitor centre has been constructed on site and some areas have been reconstructed, including a typical Iron Age roundhouse dwelling.

A Neolithic trackway once ran across what archaeologists have termed the &quot;Flag Fen Basin&quot;, from a dry-land area known as Fengate to a natural clay island called Northey. The basin is an embayment of low-lying land on the western margins of the Fens. The level of inundation by 1300 BC led the occupants to construct a timber causeway along the trackway route. The causeway and centre platform were formed by driving &#x27;thousands of posts with long pencil-like tips&#x27; through the &#x27;accumulating peaty muds&#x27; and into the firmer ground below. The resulting structure covered .

Dendrochronological analysis (dating of the posts by studying tree rings) led to an estimated date for the various stages of construction of between 1365 and 967 BC. Some of the timbers, such as oak, were not native to the local environment. They made a significant effort to transport the timbers to the site from distant sources. Similarly, scholars have traced the bluestone used at Stonehenge, Salisbury, as originating in the Preseli Mountains in Wales.

===Purpose===
Many items denoting &#x27;rank and prestige&#x27; were deposited in the water surrounding Flag Fen, including swords, spearheads, &#x27;gold earrings, tiny pins and brooches&#x27;. Archaeologist Francis Pryor, who discovered the site in 1982, suggests that &#x27;settlers often vied for social status by showing they could afford to discard valuable possessions&#x27;. There is also evidence of intentional destruction before placement, e.g. daggers broken in half placed on top of each other.

Other finds included small, polished, white stones of a type not known in the area, indicating that they had been intentionally collected and transported to and placed at the site. Other artefacts found were animal bones, including horse mandibles. Horses were very valuable to the prehistoric people, since they provided a means of transport and could supplement or replace man-power. For example, they could be used to carry or pull timbers on sledges over long distances. Significance is also drawn from the discovery of the ritual deposits within thirty metres of the timber post line, and only on its southern boundary. The amount, type, and placement of deposits, which continued for more than 1,200 years, support the theory that &#x27;at least one facet of the site&#x27; was a role as a &#x27;religious monument&#x27;.

On Northey Island many round barrows contemporary with Flag Fen were found. These seemed to be constructed over the dwellings of &#x27;chiefs&#x27;. Mike Parker Pearson refers to this as the &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. There is also evidence of farming, including sheep remains, contemporary with the site. Phosphate analysis reveals high concentrations of cremations in the barrows, in the form of satellite and secondary burials in the round barrows. This suggests that the primary burials may have been of chiefs, or socially powerful/respected people, and that some people may have paid to be buried close to the person they respected or followed.

===Destruction and preservation===
Because of its waterlogged condition the Flag Fen Basin was an area where peat deposits developed around 2000 BC, and they survive there today. The anaerobic conditions generated by silt deposits from the fens protected the wooden posts and rafters of the collapsed structures from rotting away under the influence of air and bacteria. In the 10th century BC the ground level was much lower than today, increasing around 1 mm (0.039 inches) per year as autumnal debris was added to the surface of the fens. By the early Roman period most of the structure was covered and preserved.

==Archaeological investigation==
The site was discovered in 1982 when a team led by Francis Pryor carried out a survey of dykes in the area funded by English Heritage. In 1992 Pryor told &quot;National Geographic&quot; that he &quot;stumbled – literally – upon&#x27; Flag Fen &#x27;when he tripped on a piece of wood lying in the bottom of a drainage ditch.&quot; Excavation commenced in the Summer of 1984 and by 1990 had revealed vertical and horizontal timbers, animal bones, a bronze dagger and other metal items and fragments, flint implements and 400 potsherds. Further finds included items imported from continental Europe and the oldest surviving wooden wheel found in England.

In 2012 DigVentures ran the world&#x27;s first crowdfunded excavation, raising £30,000 to enable a three-week excavation at Flag Fen. The site had experienced a 50% decline in visitors since the large-scale English Heritage-funded excavations had finished in 1995. The project&#x27;s remit was to help revitalise the heritage attraction whilst providing detailed scientific information on the preservation of the waterlogged timbers. The project involved around 250 members of the public from 11 countries, supported by a specialist team including partners from the British Museum, Durham University, Birmingham University, York Archaeological Trust, University College London and English Heritage to assist in the scientific investigations. 130 members of public received hands-on training in archaeological techniques on site and visitor numbers increased by 29% from the previous year. Francis Pryor was supportive of the initiative and wrote afterwards: &quot;happily, it was an experiment that worked: the participants had a good time, and the archaeology was professionally excavated, to a very high standard.&quot;

===Preservation===
Archaeological work at Flag Fen is ongoing. Extensive drainage of the surrounding area, which benefits agriculture, means that many of the timbers are drying out and are threatened with destruction by such exposure. One section of poles is being preserved by replacing the cellulose in the wood with water-carried wax, impregnating the wood over the years. This technique is also being used to preserve Seahenge and the Hassholme Boat. Another preservation technique used for timbers found at the site is freeze drying.

A well-organised visitor centre, the Flag Fen Bronze and Iron Age Centre, has been constructed there with a museum and exhibitions. In the preservation hall one section of the timbers is preserved in situ and prevented from drying out by misting with water. Also at the site are reconstructions of two Bronze Age roundhouses and one from the Iron Age. A section of the Roman road known as the Fen Causeway has been exposed and crosses the site. In addition there is a reconstruction of a prehistoric droveway used for moving livestock.

===Related books===
In 1991, Pryor published his first book about Flag Fen, entitled &quot;Flag Fen: Prehistoric Fenland Centre&quot;, as one of a series co-produced by English Heritage and B.T. Batsford. The final monograph on the site – entitled &quot;The Flag Fen Basin: Archaeology and environment of a Fenland Landscape&quot; – was published in 2001 as an English Heritage Archaeological Report. The report is now available online through the Archaeology Data Service. Pryor has followed this with a third book on the site, published by Tempus in 2005. Entitled &quot;Flag Fen: Life and Death of a Prehistoric Landscape&quot;, it is what he has described as a &quot;major revision&quot; of his 1991 work, for instance repudiating his earlier &quot;lake village&quot; concept.

=== Must Farm ===
Around south of Flag Fen is Must Farm Bronze Age settlement. Log boats recovered there are preserved and displayed at Flag Fen.

==Wildlife==
Flag Fen is also home to an abundance of wildlife owing to the variety of habitats on the site, which includes extensive grassland, traditionally managed hedgerows and woodland and a freshwater mere and dyke.

===&#x27;Bronze Age&#x27; BioBlitz===
On 2 August 2014, a BioBlitz organised by Vivacity found 190 species, including 53 lichens and the endangered European water vole and barn owl. The event also included a talk by the People&#x27;s Trust for Endangered Species and used a wildlife trail to highlight species that would have been present 3,000 years ago, such as the grey wolf, brown bear and Eurasian beaver.

===Meadow proposals===
In 2014, Buglife was successful in a bid to create wild-flower meadows across Peterborough, which will include a traditionally managed hay meadow at Flag Fen.

<text>José Manuel Restrepo Vélez (30 December 1781 – 1 April 1863) was an investigator of Colombian flora, political figure and historian. The orchid genus &quot;Restrepia&quot; was named in his honor.

Restrepo was born in the town of Envigado, Antioquia in the Colombian Mid-west. He graduated as a lawyer from the Colegio de San Bartolomé in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá. He later worked as Secretary for Juan del Corral and Governor Dionisio Tejada during their dictatorial government over Antioquia. 

From 1811 to 1814 he became a Deputy Representative of Antioquia during the Congress of the United Provinces of New Granada. After independence from Spain was achieved by Simon Bolivar, Restrepo became governor of Antioquia in 1819 as it came to be part of Greater Colombia.

Restrepo was profoundly interested in geography and fauna of Antioquia.

<doc id="217599" wikidata="Q127310" url="?curid=217599" title="Æon Flux">
<text>Æon Flux (), an American avant-garde science-fiction adventure animated television series, aired on MTV from November 30, 1991 until October 10, 1995, with a later film, comic-book and video-game adaptations. It premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Television&quot; experimental animation show as a six-part serial, followed in 1992 by five individual short episodes. In 1995, a season of ten half-hour episodes aired as a stand-alone series. &quot;Æon Flux&quot; was created by American animator Peter Chung. Each episode&#x27;s plot has elements of social science fiction, biopunk, dystopian fiction, spy fiction, psychological drama, postmodern and psychedelic imagery, and Gnostic symbolism.

The live-action movie &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, loosely based upon the series and starring Charlize Theron, was released in theaters on December 2, 2005, preceded in November of that year by a tie-in video game of the same name – based mostly on the movie but containing some elements of the original television series.

==Plot==
&quot;Æon Flux&quot; is set in a surreal German Expressionist-style future. The setting depicts a bizarre dystopia populated by mutant creatures, clones and robots, set within two city-states (Monica and Bregna) separated by a border wall in an otherwise barren earth-like world. The title character is a scantily clad dominatrix/secret agent from Monica — skilled in espionage, assassination and acrobatics. She infiltrates and sabotages installations in Bregna (), which is led by her sworn enemy, and sometime lover, Trevor Goodchild — the technocratic dictator of Bregna, whose citizens are called Breens. The two nations engage in a futile, never-ending war for ideological supremacy. Monica is portrayed as an anarchistic or libertarian society where there is absolute freedom and individualism. Bregna is shown as a totalitarian regime and an Orwellian police state with an oppressed society under constant surveillance, rules and regulations. Themes of tragic/forbidden love run throughout the series; Trevor has everything, but what he truly wants is Æon, and Æon can accomplish anything she wants except settling down with Trevor.

==Voice cast==
==Development==
Some authors consider the title a reference to the Gnostic notion of an Aeon, noting the influence in the use of a demiurge in one episode, and that the relationship between the main characters parallels the Valentinian notion of a syzygy. Peter Chung, the creator, says the main character&#x27;s name &quot;started out just being the name of the cartoon and then eventually it stuck, so that&#x27;s her name.&quot; The character Æon Flux was not meant to be part of the series, but MTV pushed to keep her in it, despite Æon dying at the end of the first batch of shorts. Chung intended the cartoon to be a reaction to heroic Hollywood action films, not as a spoof, but rather as a way to make the audience wonder about the wider context of these action heroes and evoke thought. &quot;Æon Flux&quot; is therefore notable as the first American adult animated series to be a drama rather than a comedy.

One peculiarity of the early shorts is the violent death of Æon Flux, which occurs in each installment. According to the commentary by Peter Chung in the 2005 DVD release, she dies in every short episode after the initial six-part pilot because he never intended to make more episodes and felt the best solution was to have her keep dying; by contrast, she only &quot;dies&quot; once in the half-hour series. Often her death is caused by fate, while other times she dies due to her own incompetence. One of the half-hour episodes, &quot;A Last Time for Everything&quot;, ends with the original Æon being killed and replaced by an identical clone. (In the episode &quot;Chronophasia&quot;, Æon is apparently killed repeatedly by a monstrous baby, but the reality of these events is ambiguous. In &quot;Ether Drift Theory&quot;, Æon is suspended indefinitely in an inanimate state, but remains technically alive.)

===Style===
Chung describes the style of the show as &quot;academic&quot;: &quot;I was interested in experimenting with visual narrative, telling a story without dialogue and also trying to create a style of telling a story with animation that wasn&#x27;t influenced by the usual kinds of things that you see.&quot; &quot;Æon Flux&quot; depicts graphic violence and sexuality, including fetishism and domination. The featurette &quot;Investigation: The History of Æon Flux&quot; (included on the 2005 DVD release) notes that Peter Chung had worked on &quot;Rugrats&quot; prior to &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, and had become extremely frustrated by the limitations of the characters. Chung says the visual style was influenced by Hergé, &quot;ligne claire&quot;, Egon Schiele, and Moebius.

With the exceptions of the exclamation &quot;No!&quot; in the pilot and the single word &quot;plop&quot; in the episode &quot;Leisure&quot;, all of the short episodes are completely devoid of intelligible speech. Instead, the sound track employs a variety of sound effects, including sounds such as laughter, grunts, and sighs. It would not be until the beginning of Season 3 that dialogue would be used much more extensively.

===Music===
The music and sound design for the original television series was created by Drew Neumann, who also created music for &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;. Peter Stone (of Xorcist) served as assistant sound editor for the original MTV series.

The music was later released on CD by Klasky Csupo&#x27;s record label, Tone Casualties, titled &quot;Eye Spy – Ears Only: Confidential&quot;. The initials &quot;AF&quot; were used on song titles and in the credits to replace the words &quot;Æon Flux&quot; due to the lack of licensing permissions from MTV. The album includes two discs worth of material from the series as well as the canceled original (1995) video game.

An abbreviated edition of the album&#x27;s first disc, titled &quot;Æon Flux: Music from the Animated Series&quot;, was included as a bonus with the 2005 DVD set at Best Buy. This edition included 11 pieces of score, with dialogue snippets featuring Æon and Trevor interspersed as standalone tracks.

Neumann self-released an expanded, remastered version of the album, retitled &quot;Eye Spy: Declassified, Freedom of Information Act&quot;, as a digital download in 2010, with new artwork by Peter Chung and a previously unreleased third volume of music. This edition was reissued by Waxwork Records on vinyl, digital download, and streaming on February 17, 2023, and on CD the following April, as &quot;Æon Flux: Original Soundtrack&quot;.

A soundtrack to the live action film was composed by Graeme Revell.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast history==
MTV was the exclusive broadcaster of the series in the United States. In Canada, the shorts aired on MuchMusic and the third season aired a year or so later on the youth-oriented network YTV, in a late-night timeslot, during a period when the network was trying to appeal to an older audience. In Australia and New Zealand, during the early to mid-1990s, the &quot;Liquid Television&quot; shorts and the first series were shown on the program &quot;Eat Carpet&quot; on SBS television. In Southeast Asia the third season was broadcast in 1996 via the MTV Southeast Asia channel, which at the time was free to anyone with a satellite dish. In the UK, MTV first showed the shorts and the 30-minute episodes from 1992. In the mid-1990s, the BBC showed the &quot;Liquid Television&quot; shorts, which included all of the &quot;Æon Flux&quot; shorts. Locomotion played the third season repeatedly, between 1998–1999 and 2002–2003, in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America. The series was also aired on Norwegian channel NRK2, a sister channel to state channel NRK, alongside &quot;The Maxx&quot;, &quot;Phantom 2040&quot;, and &quot;The Head&quot; in the late 1990s. Teletoon Detour also aired it with &quot;The Maxx&quot;.

In the lead-up to the 2006 international release of &quot;Æon Flux&quot; on DVD and the live-action movie, MTV UK replayed the third season of &quot;Æon Flux&quot; from October to November in 2005. The episodes were played at 2 a.m. on weeknights. MTV Australia followed with replays of the third season beginning in December 2005, scheduled at 1 a.m. on weeknights. The episodes were titled &quot;Æon Flux Animation,&quot; and they were not played in the original order from 1995.

As of 2009, MTV2 shows &quot;Æon Flux&quot; shorts as a part of the block &quot;MTV2 Legit.&quot; During January and February 2011, &quot;Æon Flux&quot; was aired once again in El Salvador on VH1, in English language with Spanish subtitles. The half-hour episodes once again resurfaced on MTV Classic in 2016, shortly before that station switched to an all-video format.

==Home media==
===VHS===
The series was issued across three VHS tapes between 1996 and 1998, which were later collected in a box set. Some of the shorts also appeared on a &quot;Best of Liquid Television&quot; compilation.

===DVD and UMD===
The first VHS volume was issued on DVD in 1997.

The complete series was collected in a 3-DVD set on November 22, 2005. These DVDs featured new director&#x27;s cuts of several episodes, with added special effects, and in a few cases, new dialogue intended to improve character continuity between episodes. Among the many changes to the dialogue in the DVD release, the voice of the character Clavius in the episode &quot;Utopia or Deuteranopia&quot;, originally recorded by voice actor Joseph Drelich, was re-recorded by series executive producer Japhet Asher.

The DVD set includes two featurettes and audio commentary on several episodes. It also features a promotional video for the movie&#x27;s tie-in video game, in the narrative style of the &quot;Liquid Television&quot; shorts but animated in CGI. The short sees Æon (with Theron&#x27;s likeness) on a mission, killing many Breen soldiers while pursuing some small, insect-like robots. Like the original shorts, it ends with Æon&#x27;s accidental death.

The set was released, with reduced special features, on UMD for the PlayStation Portable in January 2008.

==Reception==
Reviewing the 2005 DVD release, IGN gave the series 9 out of 10, while giving the whole package (shorts, extras and general condition included) a 7 out of 10.

CyberpunkReview.com gave the series a glowing review, saying the series was &quot;one of the really creative shows to come out of United States Television. This show validates the purpose of cable TV—we get to see talented folks like Peter Chung let loose their creative energies to produce something truly unique.&quot;

Nina Munteanu of &quot;Europa SF&quot; reviewed and compared both the movie and the series; she said that while the movie sacrificed character development in pursuit of a coherent story, the series chose the path of deep characters and themes. She summed up by saying, &quot;While the film&#x27;s moralistic tale resonated and lingered like a muse&#x27;s long forgotten poem, the subversive kick of the comic [sic] series (which I thankfully saw later) struck deep chords and left me breathless with questions.&quot;

==In other media==
===Film===

An &quot;Æon Flux&quot; Hollywood adaptation, which was released in the United States on December 2, 2005, starring Charlize Theron, provoked controversy among &quot;Æon Flux&quot; fans over initial reports that the film adaptation seemed to bear little resemblance to the original full-length animated series or the &quot;Liquid Television&quot; shorts, as no one involved with the original television series had a role in the making of the film. While it does take a number of major liberties with the character and concept of the series (such as making the character of Una into Æon&#x27;s sister and giving Trevor a previously-unmentioned brother who plays a major role), the film also incorporates characters, themes, gadgets, and even specific scenes as featured in the television version, most notably a reenactment of the television show&#x27;s most iconic image: Æon trapping a fly in her eyelashes. This minor detail was not nearly enough to avoid having the movie become a critical and box office flop.

The creator of &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, Peter Chung, gave an interview to the &quot;Monican Spies&quot; community on LiveJournal in 2006. He was asked many questions about Æon Flux and her universe, including how he really felt about the movie. Chung called the movie &quot;a &quot;, relating that its public screening made him feel &quot;helpless, humiliated, and sad&quot;. He described his primary objection to the film as being its portrayal of the Æon and Trevor characters and their re-imagined history and relationship. Chung went on to state, &quot;Ms. Flux does not actually appear in the movie.&quot;

===Comics===

A &quot;graphic novel&quot; called &quot;Æon Flux: The Herodotus File,&quot; which actually consisted of an assortment of false documents from the world of &quot;Æon Flux&quot; and a short story-board-style sequence described as &quot;security camera footage&quot; rather than a comic strip story, was published in 1995. In it, authors Mark Mars and Eric Singer provided vague explanations of some of the show&#x27;s setting and backstory, including how Trevor and Æon met. One hint suggested in the series, and confirmed by Mars and Singer in the graphic novel, is the character&#x27;s foot fetish modeling; it is suggested that she augments her income posing barefoot for magazines devoted to the fetish. The graphic novel fell out of print in the years that followed the show&#x27;s conclusion, but it was temporarily re-issued in 2005, with new cover art, to tie in with the movie.

As another tie-in to the movie, Dark Horse Comics published a four-issue comic book mini-series, collected as a trade paperback and written and drawn by Mike Kennedy and Timothy Green III, who based their work upon the film versions of the &quot;Æon Flux&quot; characters. Although the characters and situations were based on the newer movie versions, the penciling technique deliberately emulated Peter Chung&#x27;s unique style from the TV series.

===Pepsi commercial===
Though not directly connected to the series, a live-action/animated Diet Pepsi commercial titled &quot;Something Wrong?&quot; was directed by Peter Chung and starred Malcolm McDowell as a Trevor Goodchild-like character and Cindy Crawford as an Æon Flux-like character. It was made for Super Bowl XXX in 1996, but was pulled and later aired for broadcast exclusive to MTV. &quot;Something Wrong?&quot; is available online at YouTube.

===Video games===
====Released 2005 game====

To coincide with the release of the 2005 film, Majesco Entertainment and developer Terminal Reality released a video game adaptation on Xbox and PlayStation 2. While primarily based on the film, elements from both the movie and the television series are included, as the game sets out to be something of a canonical link between the two, although the Æon character in the game is modeled only after Theron and is also voiced by her.

====Unfinished 1996 game====
A game based on the original animated series was announced on April 9, 1996 for the PlayStation. The game, which was loosely based on &quot;The Demiurge&quot; episode, was being developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Viacom New Media. The game first made an appearance at E3 that same year, with &quot;Æon Flux&quot; creator Peter Chung on hand to promote it, and commercial advertising was even included in the 1996 VHS release of the animated series. A developer build of it was leaked, and pictures of this build can be found on various websites.

Viacom New Media would merge with Virgin Interactive midway through the game&#x27;s development. The merger ultimately led to the cancellation of Viacom&#x27;s in-development games, leaving Cryo without the rights to use the &quot;Æon Flux&quot; property. In mid-1997, the &quot;Æon Flux&quot; video game rights were acquired by GT Interactive. The game&#x27;s assets were then reworked into the 1997 title &quot;Pax Corpus&quot; after being stripped of all copyrighted association with &quot;Æon Flux&quot;. &quot;Pax Corpus&quot; does retain obvious similarities to the original animated series, e.g. parts of the plot are similar to the episode &quot;The Demiurge&quot; and the female protagonist wears a purple and black outfit.

====Unfinished 2000 game====
Another failed attempt would be made by The Collective some time around the year 2000, and was to be published by GT Interactive. It was using a then-current version of the Unreal Engine, and appeared to be a 3D third-person action title similar to The Collective&#x27;s previous title, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Fallen&quot;. At some point during development, the game was cancelled and the project vanished, leaving only a few work-in-progress screenshots as evidence of its existence.

===Live-action television reboot===
In June 2018, it was reported that a live-action television reboot is in works at MTV with Jeff Davis and Gale Anne Hurd as executive producers. In September 2021, it was reported that a live-action television reboot is in works at Paramount+, under a new overall deal that Davis has signed with MTV Entertainment Studios. Davis will serve as showrunner and direct the pilot. In early 2023, Davis reported the first two episodes had been written, which he planned to direct.

<doc id="217607" wikidata="Q1143386" url="?curid=217607" title="Alpha process">
<text>The alpha process, also known as alpha capture or the alpha ladder, is one of two classes of nuclear fusion reactions by which stars convert helium into heavier elements. The other class is a cycle of reactions called the triple-alpha process, which consumes only helium, and produces carbon. The alpha process most commonly occurs in massive stars and during supernovae.

Both processes are preceded by hydrogen fusion, which produces the helium that fuels both the triple-alpha process and the alpha ladder processes. After the triple-alpha process has produced enough carbon, the alpha-ladder begins and fusion reactions of increasingly heavy elements take place, in the order listed below. Each step only consumes the product of the previous reaction and helium. The later-stage reactions which are able to begin in any particular star, do so while the prior stage reactions are still under way in outer layers of the star.

:formula_1
The energy produced by each reaction, , is mainly in the form of gamma rays (), with a small amount taken by the byproduct element, as added momentum.

It is a common misconception that the above sequence ends at formula_2 (or formula_3, which is a decay product of formula_2) because it is the most tightly bound nuclide – i.e., the nuclide with the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon – and production of heavier nuclei would consume energy (be endothermic) instead of release it (exothermic). formula_5 (Nickel-62) is actually the most tightly bound nuclide in terms of binding energy (though formula_6 has a lower energy or mass per nucleon). The reaction formula_7 is actually exothermic, and indeed adding alphas continues to be exothermic all the way to formula_8, but nonetheless the sequence does effectively end at iron. The sequence stops before producing elements heavier than nickel because conditions in stellar interiors cause the competition between photodisintegration and the alpha process to favor photodisintegration around iron. This leads to more formula_2 being produced than formula_10

All these reactions have a very low rate at the temperatures and densities in stars and therefore do not contribute significant energy to a star&#x27;s total output. They occur even less easily with elements heavier than neon () due to the increasing Coulomb barrier.

== Alpha process elements ==
Alpha process elements (or alpha elements) are so-called since their most abundant isotopes are integer multiples of four – the mass of the helium nucleus (the alpha particle). These isotopes are called &quot;alpha nuclides&quot;.
* The stable alpha elements are: C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and S.
* The elements Ar and Ca are &quot;observationally stable&quot;. They are synthesized by alpha capture prior to the silicon fusing stage, that leads to 
* Si and Ca are purely alpha process elements.
* Mg can be separately consumed by proton capture reactions.

The status of oxygen (O) is contested – some authors consider it an alpha element, while others do not. O is surely an alpha element in low-metallicity Population II stars: It is produced in Type II supernovae, and its enhancement is well correlated with an enhancement of other alpha process elements.

Sometimes C and N are considered alpha process elements since, like O, they are synthesized in nuclear alpha-capture reactions, but their status is ambiguous: Each of the three elements is produced (and consumed) by the CNO cycle, which can proceed at temperatures far lower than those where the alpha-ladder processes start producing significant amounts of alpha elements (including C, N, &amp; O). So just the presence of C, N, or O in a star does not a clearly indicate that the alpha process is actually underway – hence reluctance of some astronomers to (unconditionally) call these three &quot;alpha elements&quot;.

== Production in stars ==
The alpha process generally occurs in large quantities only if the star is sufficiently massive – more massive than about 10 solar masses. These stars contract as they age, increasing core temperature and density to high enough levels to enable the alpha process. Requirements increase with atomic mass, especially in later stages – sometimes referred to as silicon burning – and thus most commonly occur in supernovae. Type II supernovae mainly synthesize oxygen and the alpha-elements (Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ti) while Type Ia supernovae mainly produce elements of the iron peak (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Sufficiently massive stars can synthesize elements up to and including the iron peak solely from the hydrogen and helium that initially comprises the star.

Typically, the first stage of the alpha process (or alpha-capture) follows from the helium-burning stage of the star once helium becomes depleted; at this point, free formula_11 capture helium to produce formula_12. This process continues after the core finishes the helium burning phase as a shell around the core will continue burning helium and convecting into the core. The second stage (neon burning) starts as helium is freed by the photodisintegration of one formula_13 atom, allowing another to continue up the alpha ladder. Silicon burning is then later initiated through the photodisintegration of formula_14 in a similar fashion; after this point, the formula_2peak discussed previously is reached. The supernova shock wave produced by stellar collapse provides ideal conditions for these processes to briefly occur. 

During this terminal heating involving photodisintegration and rearrangement, nuclear particles are converted to their most stable forms during the supernova and subsequent ejection through, in part, alpha processes. Starting at formula_16 and above, all the product elements are radioactive and will therefore decay into a more stable isotope; for instance, formula_2 is formed and decays into formula_18.

== Special notation for relative abundance ==
The abundance of total alpha elements in stars is usually expressed in terms of logarithms, with astronomers customarily using a square bracket notation:
:formula_19 
where formula_20 is the number of alpha elements per unit volume, and formula_21 is the number of iron nuclei per unit volume. It is for the purpose of calculating the number formula_20 that which elements are to be considered &quot;alpha elements&quot; becomes contentious. Theoretical galactic evolution models predict that early in the universe there were more alpha elements relative to iron.

<text>The Society of the Cincinnati is a fraternal, hereditary society founded in 1783 to commemorate the American Revolutionary War that saw the creation of the United States. Membership is largely restricted to descendants of military officers who served in the Continental Army.

The Society has thirteen constituent societies in the United States and one in France. It was founded to perpetuate &quot;the remembrance of this vast event&quot; (the achievement of American Independence), &quot;to preserve inviolate those exalted rights and liberties of human nature,&quot; and &quot;to render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among the officers&quot; of the Continental Army who served in the Revolutionary War.

Now in its third century, the Society promotes public interest in the Revolution through its library and museum collections, publications, and other activities. It is the oldest patriotic, hereditary society in the United States.

== History == 
The Society is named after Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who left his farm to accept a term as Roman Consul and served as Magister Populi (with temporary powers similar to that of a modern-era dictator). He assumed lawful dictatorial control of Rome to meet a war emergency. When the battle was won, he returned power to the Senate and went back to plowing his fields. The Society&#x27;s motto reflects that ethic of selfless service: &quot;Omnia reliquit servare rempublicam&quot; (&quot;He relinquished everything to save the Republic&quot;). The Society has had three goals: &quot;To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.&quot;

The concept of the Society of the Cincinnati was that of Major General Henry Knox. The first meeting of the Society was held in May 1783 at a dinner at the Verplanck House (present-day Mount Gulian), Fishkill, New York, before the British evacuation from New York City. The meeting was presided over by Major General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton serving as the orator. The participants agreed to stay in contact with each other after the war. Mount Gulian, von Steuben&#x27;s headquarters, is considered the birthplace of the Society of the Cincinnati, where the Institution was formally adopted on May 13, 1783.

Membership was generally limited to officers who had served at least three years in the Continental Army or Navy, or had served until the end of the War; it included officers of the French Army and Navy above certain ranks. Officers in the Continental Line who died during the War were also entitled to be recorded as members, and membership would devolve to their eldest male heir. Members of the considerably larger fighting forces comprising the Colonial Militias and Minutemen were not entitled to join the Society. Within 12 months of the founding, a constituent Society had been organized in each of the 13 states and in France. Of about 5,500 men originally eligible for membership, 2,150 had joined within a year. King Louis XVI ordained the French Society of the Cincinnati, which was organized on July 4, 1784 (Independence Day). Up to that time, the King of France had not allowed his officers to wear any foreign decorations, but he made an exception in favor of the badge of the Cincinnati.
The Society&#x27;s rules adopted a system of primogeniture, wherein membership was passed down to the eldest son after the death of the original member. Present-day hereditary members generally must be descended from an original member, an officer who died in service, or an officer who qualified for membership at the Society&#x27;s founding but did not join. Each officer may be represented by only one descendant at any given time, following the rules of primogeniture. (The rules of eligibility and admission are controlled by each of the 14 Constituent Societies to which members are admitted. They differ slightly in each society, and some allow more than one descendant of an eligible officer.) The requirement for primogeniture made the society controversial in its early years, as the new states quickly did away with laws supporting primogeniture as remnants of the English feudal system.

George Washington was elected the first President General of the Society, serving from December 1783 until he died in 1799. The second President General was Alexander Hamilton, and after he died from wounds suffered in a duel in 1804, he was succeeded by Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.

The society&#x27;s members have included notable military and political leaders, including 23 of the 39 signers of the United States Constitution.

== Insignia ==

On June 19, 1783, the General Society of the Cincinnati adopted the bald eagle, one of America&#x27;s first post-revolution symbols and an important piece of American iconography, as its insignia. (The insignia was initially called an &quot;order&quot; in the Society&#x27;s records.) It is the second official American emblem to use the bald eagle, following the Great Seal of the United States. The insignia may have been derived from the same discourse that produced the seal.

The suggestion of the bald eagle as the Cincinnati insignia was made by Major Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, a French officer who joined the American Army in 1777, served in the Corps of Engineers, and became one of the first members of the Society. He observed that &quot;[t]he Bald Eagle, which is unique to this continent, and is distinguished from those of other climates by its white head and tail, appears to me to deserve attention.&quot; In 1783, L&#x27;Enfant was commissioned to travel to France to have the first eagle badges made, based on his design).

The medallions at the center of the Cincinnati Eagle depict, on the obverse, Cincinnatus receiving his sword from Roman senators and, on the reverse, Cincinnatus at his plow being crowned by the figure of Pheme (a personification of fame). The Society&#x27;s light blue and white colors symbolize the fraternal bond between the United States and France. While all Cincinnati Eagles conform to this general design, no single specific design is official. Over 50 variations of the eagle have been produced over the years.

A unique diamond-encrusted &quot;eagle&quot;, referred to as the &quot;Diamond Eagle&quot;, was given to George Washington by Admiral Comte d&#x27;Estaing on behalf of the officers of the French Navy. Washington received it on May 11, 1784, at the meeting of the General Society in Philadelphia. Upon Washington&#x27;s death in 1799, it was given by his heirs to Alexander Hamilton, who succeeded Washington as President of the Society. Upon Hamilton&#x27;s death, it was given to Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who succeeded Hamilton as the Society&#x27;s president. It has since served as the official insignia of the Society&#x27;s president and is transferred when a new president takes office. In the late 20th century, a copy of the Diamond Eagle was made and worn by the president on occasions other than the Triennial Meeting.

A specially commissioned &quot;eagle&quot; worn by President General George Washington was presented to Marquis de Lafayette in 1824 during his grand tour of the United States. This badge remained in possession of the Lafayette family until sold at auction on December 11, 2007, for 5.3 million USD by Lafayette&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter. Together with what is believed to be the original ribbon and red leather box, the badge was purchased by the Josée and René de Chambrun Foundation for display in Lafayette&#x27;s bedroom at Chateau La Grange, his former home, thirty miles east of Paris; it may also be displayed at Mount Vernon, Washington&#x27;s former home in Virginia. This was one of three eagles known to have been owned by Washington, who most often wore the &quot;diamond eagle&quot;, a diamond-encrusted badge given him by the French &quot;matelots&quot; (sailors). That diamond eagle continues to be passed down to each President General of the Society of the Cincinnati as part of his induction into office.

The Cincinnati Eagle is displayed in various places of public importance, including Sawyer Point in Cincinnati (named for the Society), Ohio. A popular public square was built here to house a 15&#x27; bronze statue of Cincinnatus flanked by four masts flying the American, state, city, and Society flags. The flag of the Society displays blue and white stripes and a dark blue canton (containing a circle of 14 stars around the Cincinnati Eagle, representing the fourteen subsidiary societies) in the upper corner next to the hoist. Refer to the section below for the city&#x27;s historical connection to the Society.

By Federal law, Society members may wear their eagles on their American military uniforms on ceremonial occasions. In practice, however, this has been rarely done since the early 20th century.

== Criticism ==

When news of the foundation of the society spread, judge Aedanus Burke published several pamphlets under the pseudonym &quot;Cassius&quot; where he criticized the society as an attempt at reestablishing a hereditary nobility in the new republic. The pamphlets, entitled &quot;An Address to the Freemen of South Carolina&quot; (January 1783) and &quot;Considerations on the Society or Order of Cincinnati&quot; (October 1783), sparked a general outcry that included prominent names, including Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The criticism voiced concern about the apparent creation of a hereditary elite; membership eligibility is inherited through primogeniture and generally excluded enlisted men and militia officers unless they were placed under &quot;State Line&quot; or &quot;Continental Line&quot; forces for a substantial period, and their descendants.

Benjamin Franklin was among the Society&#x27;s earliest critics. He was concerned about the creation of a quasi-noble order and of the Society&#x27;s use of the eagle in its emblem, as evoking the traditions of heraldry and the English aristocracy. In a letter to his daughter Sarah Bache written on January 26, 1784, Franklin commented on the ramifications of the Cincinnati:

I only wonder that, when the united Wisdom of our Nation had, in the Articles of Confederation, manifested their Dislike of establishing Ranks of Nobility, by Authority either of the Congress or of any particular State, a Number of private persons should think proper to distinguish themselves and their Posterity, from their fellow Citizens, and form an Order of &quot;hereditary Knights&quot;, in direct Opposition to the solemnly declared Sense of their Country.

The influence of the Cincinnati members, former officers, was another concern. When delegates to the Constitutional Convention were debating the method of choosing a president, James Madison (the secretary of the convention) reported the following speech of Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts:

A popular election in this case is radically vicious. The ignorance of the people would put it in the power of some one set of men dispersed through the Union &amp; acting in Concert to delude them into any appointment. He observed that such a Society of men existed in the Order of the Cincinnati. They are respectable, United, and influential. They will in fact elect the chief Magistrate in every instance, if the election be referred to the people. [Gerry&#x27;s] respect for the characters composing this Society could not blind him to the danger &amp; impropriety of throwing such a power into their hands.

The debate spread to France because of the eligibility of French veterans from the Revolutionary War. In 1785 Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau was approached by Franklin, who was at the time stationed in Paris, and suggested to him to write something about the society directed at the French public. Mirabeau was provided with Burke&#x27;s pamphlets and Franklin&#x27;s letter to his daughter, and from this, with the help of Nicolas Chamfort, created an enlarged version entitled &quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;Ordre de Cincinnatus&quot; which was published in London in November that year. An English translation by Samuel Romilly followed, of which an American edition was published in 1786.

Following this public debate and criticism, George Washington, who had been unaware of the particulars of the charter when he agreed to become president of the society, began to doubt the benefit of the society. At its first general meeting on May 4, 1784, he had considered abolishing the society. However, in the meantime, Major L&#x27;Enfant had arrived, bringing his designs of the diplomas and medals, as well as news of the success of the society in France, which made abolition of the society impossible. Washington instead delivered at the meeting an ultimatum that if the clauses about heredity were not abandoned, he would resign from his post as president of the society. This was accepted, and an informal agreement was made not to wear the eagles in public so as not to resemble European chivalrous orders. A new charter, the so-called &quot;Institution&quot;, was printed, which omitted, among others, the disputed clauses about heredity. This was sent to the local chapters for approval, which was approved in all of them except for the chapters in New York, New Hampshire, and Delaware. However, when the public furor about the society had died down, the new &quot;Institution&quot; was rescinded, and the original was reintroduced, including the clauses about heredity. The French chapter, which had obtained official permission to form from the king Louis XVI of France, also abolished heredity but never reintroduced it. Thus the last members were approved on February 3, 1792, shortly before the French monarchy was disbanded.

== Later activities ==
=== City development by early members ===
The members of Cincinnati were among those developing many of America&#x27;s first and most prominent cities to the west of the Appalachians, most notably Cincinnati, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The first governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, was a member of the Society. He renamed a small settlement &quot;Cincinnati&quot; to honor the Society and to encourage settlement by Society members. Among them was Captain Jacob Piatt, who settled across the river from Cincinnati in northern Kentucky on land granted to him for service during the War. Captain David Ziegler was the first Mayor of Cincinnati.

Lt. Ebenezer Denny (1761–1822), an original Pennsylvanian Cincinnatus, was elected the first mayor of the incorporated city of Pittsburgh in 1816. Pittsburgh developed from Fort Pitt, which had been commanded from 1777 to 1783 by four men who were founding members of the Society.

Richard Varick was a Mayor of New York City.

=== Public awareness ===
Today&#x27;s Society supports efforts to increase public awareness and memory of the ideals and actions of the men who created the American Revolution and an understanding of American history, emphasizing the period from the outset of the Revolution to the War of 1812. At its headquarters at Anderson House in Washington, DC, the Society holds manuscript, portrait, and model collections about events of and military science during this period. Members of the Society have contributed to endow professorships, lecture series, awards, and educational materials concerning the United States representative democracy.

=== Membership rules ===
Over the years, membership rules have continued as they were first established. The definition and acceptance of membership have remained with the constituent societies rather than the General Society in Washington. An eligible officer of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War can be represented in the Society of the Cincinnati by only one male descendant at a time, successor members excepted. Collateral male heirs are accepted in some constituent societies if the direct male line dies out.

Each of the fourteen constituent societies admits honorary male members, but these men cannot designate an heir (a successor member). The only U.S. President who was a true hereditary member was Franklin Pierce. Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor were honorary members before becoming president. Other presidents became honorary members while in office and after leaving office.

== Headquarters ==

The General Society is headquartered at Anderson House, also known as the Larz Anderson House, at 2118 Massachusetts Avenue, NW in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The Anderson House also serves as a Society museum and research library. It is located on Embassy Row, near various international embassies.

Anderson House was built between 1902 and 1905 as the winter residence of Larz Anderson, an American diplomat, and his wife, Isabel Weld Perkins, an author and American Red Cross volunteer. The architects Arthur Little and Herbert Browne of Boston designed Anderson House in the Beaux-Arts style. Anderson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was further designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996.

The General Society&#x27;s museum collections include portraits, armaments, and personal artifacts of Revolutionary War soldiers; commemorative objects; objects associated with the history of the Society and its members, including Cincinnati china and insignia; portraits and personal artifacts of members of the Anderson family; and artifacts related to the history of the house, including the U.S. Navy&#x27;s occupation of it during World War II.

<text>Angraecum, also known as comet orchid, is a genus of the family Orchidaceae native to tropical and South Africa, as well as Sri Lanka. It contains 223 species.

==Etymology==
Despite the genus&#x27;s distribution being largely confined to Africa and its offshore islands, the genus name is a latinization of the Indonesian and Malay word anggrek (&quot;orchid&quot;), itself ultimately from Javanese ꦲꦔ꧀ꦒꦿꦺꦏ꧀ (anggrék, &quot;orchid&quot;).

==Description==
Angraecums are quite varied vegetatively and florally, and are adapted to dry tropical woodland habitat and have quite fleshy leaves as a consequence. Most are epiphytes, but a few are lithophytes.

The long-lasting flowers are racemose and grow from the leaf axils. They are mostly white, but a few are yellow, green or ochre. They all have a long spur at the back of the labellum (lip).

In the case of &quot;Angraecum sesquipedale&quot;, a species from Madagascar, on observing the spur in the lip, Charles Darwin made the hypothesis that, since the nectar was at the bottom of the spur, a pollinator must exist with a tongue at least that long. Otherwise the orchid could never be pollinated. At the time, he was not believed. However, in 1903, the predicted pollinator was discovered, a hawk moth then named &quot;Xanthopan morganii praedicta&quot; (&quot;praedicta&quot; meaning &quot;the predicted one&quot;). It has an appropriately long proboscis. The specific name &quot;sesquipedale&quot; means &quot;one foot and a half&quot;, referring to the length of the spur. This is an example of mutual dependence of an orchid and a specific pollinator.

==Distribution==
Tropical Africa and Madagascar contain the majority of the genus with one outlier found on Sri Lanka, and three species once thought to belong to the genus in Japan and the Philippines. But these orchids can also be found on the Comoros, the Seychelles, and the Mascarenes. They occur between sea level and in humid regions.

==Ecology==
===Pollination===
The most commonly known example of &quot;Angraecum&quot; pollination is the relationship of &quot;Angraecum sesquipedale&quot;, which is pollinated by the moth species &quot;Xanthopan morganii praedicta&quot; However, different modes of pollination are known to occur in &quot;Angraecum&quot;. Bird pollination has been reported to occur in &quot;Angraecum striatum&quot;, which is pollinated by the bird species &quot;Zosterops borbonicus&quot; Boddaert. &quot;Angraecum cadetii&quot; is pollinated by the cricket species &quot;Glomeremus orchidophilus&quot;. There have also been speculations regarding pollination of &quot;Angraecum cadetii&quot; Bosser and &quot;Angraecum bracteosum&quot; Balf. &amp; S. Moore through the lizard species &quot;Phelsuma borbonica&quot; 

==Conservation==
Many species of &quot;Angraecum&quot; orchid are considered to be at risk of extinction in the wild and are protected from international trade under CITES. The genus Angraecum is listed as one of the top conservation priorities by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Orchid Specialist Group. Many of the species, such as &quot;Angraecum sororium&quot;, are endemic to Madagascar and are threatened from over collecting, loss of hawkmoth pollinators, habitat fragmentation, and fire.

==Horticulture==
In horticulture the generic name is abbreviated as Angcm.
Like all other orchids it is best to water in the mornings to avoid fungal rot due to overnight dampness. Feeding as per other orchids and similar light conditions: in humid and hot regions (sub tropical) feed fortnightly during growing season (Summer) with a certified orchid fertiliser following directions on packet, weaker solutions are also okay if you&#x27;re worried. In summer water weekly or more depending on situation. Angraecums flower best when in a lighter position. Keep out of direct sunlight as this can damage (and eventually kill) the plant. Most Angraecums will have their leaves for a number of years so any sun burn spots are ugly for a significant period and also may expose your plant to disease. In indirect sunlight the Angraecums will reward you with blooms and attractive growth.

&quot;Angraecum&quot; Veitchii: a very rewarding orchid. In indirect light and watered/fed regularly this plant will produce blooms annually (usually in late Winter to Spring - for Australia this occurs in August). The flowers last a while if kept in a sheltered position and their strong heady fragrance is delightful. They only release their perfume at night. Flowers are large ( across), waxy, white to greenish cream in colour and borne on stems of seven to ten depending on the faithfulness of your fertilising, watering, and indirect light provision. The leaves are large, thick straps that alternately fan out from a central (monopodal) stem. Pups (keikis) form at the base of the stem and can either be divided from the parent plant once they have at least three roots of their own or alternatively, left on the plant these will make a stunning specimen as when mature will produce blooms with the parent plant - many award-winning angraecum veitchiis are grown as such. In the right conditions these orchids are healthy and require little attention. As they are epiphytes the potting mixture should be loose and free draining. Prolific roots are formed from the base and also amongst the lower half of the foliage. These can be troublesome when moving the plant. Once your angraecum is big it is best to pot it in a heavy terracotta pot or place a brick in the bottom of the pot in order to ensure the plant does not get top heavy and risk snapping when blown over in the wind, especially since they flower during the windier times of the year. When watering a good soaking with a hose or watering-can is best (not just a misting from a spray gun) as this helps to flush away any salts from fertilisers that may be present in the potting mixture and also thoroughly wets the plant. Make sure the roots halfway up the stem get a soaking too, not just the potted roots.

<text>Vascular plants with monopodial growth habits grow upward from a single point. They add leaves to the apex each year and the stem grows longer accordingly. The word &quot;Monopodial&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;mono-&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;podial&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, in reference to the fact that monopodial plants have a single trunk or stem.

Orchids with monopodial growth often produce copious aerial roots that often hang down in long drapes and have green chlorophyll underneath the grey root coverings, which are used as additional photosynthetic organs. They do not have a rhizome or pseudobulbs so species adapted to dry periods have fleshy succulent leaves instead. Flowers generally come from the stem between the leaves. With some monopodial species, the stem (the rhizome) might fork into two, but for all monopodial orchids this is not necessary for continued growth, as opposed to orchids with sympodial growth.

<text>In mathematics, the complex plane is the plane formed by the complex numbers, with a Cartesian coordinate system such that the horizontal -axis, called the real axis, is formed by the real numbers, and the vertical -axis, called the imaginary axis, is formed by the imaginary numbers.

The complex plane allows for a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed more easily in polar coordinates: the magnitude or &#x27; of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the [[angle]] or&#x27; of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

The complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane or Gauss plane.

==Notational conventions==
===Complex numbers===
In complex analysis, the complex numbers are customarily represented by the symbol , which can be separated into its real () and imaginary () parts:

formula_1

for example: , where and are real numbers, and is the imaginary unit. In this customary notation the complex number corresponds to the point in the Cartesian plane; the point can also be represented in polar coordinates with:

formula_2

In the Cartesian plane it may be assumed that the range of the arctangent function takes the values (in radians), and some care must be taken to define the more complete arctangent function for points when . In the complex plane these polar coordinates take the form

formula_3

where

formula_4

Here is the &#x27; or &#x27; of the complex number ; , the &quot;&quot; of , is usually taken on the interval ; and the last equality (to ) is taken from Euler&#x27;s formula. Without the constraint on the range of , the argument of is multi-valued, because the complex exponential function is periodic, with period . Thus, if is one value of , the other values are given by , where is any non-zero integer.

While seldom used explicitly, the geometric view of the complex numbers is implicitly based on its structure of a Euclidean vector space of dimension 2, where the inner product of complex numbers and is given by then for a complex number its absolute value coincides with its Euclidean norm, and its argument with the angle turning from 1 to .

The theory of contour integration comprises a major part of complex analysis. In this context, the direction of travel around a closed curve is important – reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by . By convention the direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when we start at the point , then travel up and to the left through the point , then down and to the left through , then down and to the right through , and finally up and to the right to , where we started.

Almost all of complex analysis is concerned with complex functions – that is, with functions that map some subset of the complex plane into some other (possibly overlapping, or even identical) subset of the complex plane. Here it is customary to speak of the domain of as lying in the -plane, while referring to the range of as a set of points in the -plane. In symbols we write

formula_5

and often think of the function as a transformation from the -plane (with coordinates ) into the -plane (with coordinates ).

===Complex plane notation===
The complex plane is denoted as 

== Argand diagram ==

Argand diagram refers to a geometric plot of complex numbers as points using the horizontal -axis as the real axis and the vertical -axis as the imaginary axis. Such plots are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian–Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745–1818). Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the zeros and poles of a function in the complex plane.
==Stereographic projections==

It can be useful to think of the complex plane as if it occupied the surface of a sphere. Given a sphere of unit radius, place its center at the origin of the complex plane, oriented so that the equator on the sphere coincides with the unit circle in the plane, and the north pole is &quot;above&quot; the plane.

We can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points on the surface of the sphere minus the north pole and the points in the complex plane as follows. Given a point in the plane, draw a straight line connecting it with the north pole on the sphere. That line will intersect the surface of the sphere in exactly one other point. The point will be projected onto the south pole of the sphere. Since the interior of the unit circle lies inside the sphere, that entire region () will be mapped onto the southern hemisphere. The unit circle itself () will be mapped onto the equator, and the exterior of the unit circle () will be mapped onto the northern hemisphere, minus the north pole. Clearly this procedure is reversible – given any point on the surface of the sphere that is not the north pole, we can draw a straight line connecting that point to the north pole and intersecting the flat plane in exactly one point.

Under this stereographic projection the north pole itself is not associated with any point in the complex plane. We perfect the one-to-one correspondence by adding one more point to the complex plane – the so-called &quot;point at infinity&quot; – and identifying it with the north pole on the sphere. This topological space, the complex plane plus the point at infinity, is known as the extended complex plane. We speak of a single &quot;point at infinity&quot; when discussing complex analysis. There are two points at infinity (positive, and negative) on the real number line, but there is only one point at infinity (the north pole) in the extended complex plane.

Imagine for a moment what will happen to the lines of latitude and longitude when they are projected from the sphere onto the flat plane. The lines of latitude are all parallel to the equator, so they will become perfect circles centered on the origin . And the lines of longitude will become straight lines passing through the origin (and also through the &quot;point at infinity&quot;, since they pass through both the north and south poles on the sphere).

This is not the only possible yet plausible stereographic situation of the projection of a sphere onto a plane consisting of two or more values. For instance, the north pole of the sphere might be placed on top of the origin in a plane that is tangent to the circle. The details don&#x27;t really matter. Any stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane will produce one &quot;point at infinity&quot;, and it will map the lines of latitude and longitude on the sphere into circles and straight lines, respectively, in the plane.

==Cutting the plane==
When discussing functions of a complex variable it is often convenient to think of a cut in the complex plane. This idea arises naturally in several different contexts.

===Multi-valued relationships and branch points===
Consider the simple two-valued relationship

formula_6

Before we can treat this relationship as a single-valued function, the range of the resulting value must be restricted somehow. When dealing with the square roots of non-negative real numbers this is easily done. For instance, we can just define

formula_7

to be the non-negative real number such that . This idea doesn&#x27;t work so well in the two-dimensional complex plane. To see why, let&#x27;s think about the way the value of varies as the point moves around the unit circle. We can write formula_8 and take
formula_9

Evidently, as moves all the way around the circle, only traces out one-half of the circle. So one continuous motion in the complex plane has transformed the positive square root into the negative square root .

This problem arises because the point has just one square root, while every other complex number has exactly two square roots. On the real number line we could circumvent this problem by erecting a &quot;barrier&quot; at the single point . A bigger barrier is needed in the complex plane, to prevent any closed contour from completely encircling the branch point . This is commonly done by introducing a branch cut; in this case the &quot;cut&quot; might extend from the point along the positive real axis to the point at infinity, so that the argument of the variable in the cut plane is restricted to the range .

We can now give a complete description of . To do so we need two copies of the -plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be , and on the other we define the square root of 1 to be . We call these two copies of the complete cut plane &quot;&quot;. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function maps the first sheet into the upper half of the -plane, where , while mapping the second sheet into the lower half of the -plane (where ).

The branch cut in this example does not have to lie along the real axis; it does not even have to be a straight line. Any continuous curve connecting the origin with the point at infinity would work. In some cases the branch cut doesn&#x27;t even have to pass through the point at infinity. For example, consider the relationship

formula_10

Here the polynomial vanishes when , so evidently has two branch points. We can &quot;cut&quot; the plane along the real axis, from to , and obtain a sheet on which is a single-valued function. Alternatively, the cut can run from along the positive real axis through the point at infinity, then continue &quot;up&quot; the negative real axis to the other branch point, .

This situation is most easily visualized by using the stereographic projection described above. On the sphere one of these cuts runs longitudinally through the southern hemisphere, connecting a point on the equator () with another point on the equator (), and passing through the south pole (the origin, ) on the way. The second version of the cut runs longitudinally through the northern hemisphere and connects the same two equatorial points by passing through the north pole (that is, the point at infinity).

===Restricting the domain of meromorphic functions===
A meromorphic function is a complex function that is holomorphic and therefore analytic everywhere in its domain except at a finite, or countably infinite, number of points. The points at which such a function cannot be defined are called the poles of the meromorphic function. Sometimes all of these poles lie in a straight line. In that case mathematicians may say that the function is &quot;holomorphic on the cut plane&quot;. By example:

The gamma function, defined by

formula_11

where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, and has simple poles at because exactly one denominator in the infinite product vanishes when , or a negative integer. Since all its poles lie on the negative real axis, from to the point at infinity, this function might be described as &quot;holomorphic on the cut plane, the cut extending along the negative real axis, from 0 (inclusive) to the point at infinity.&quot;

Alternatively, might be described as &quot;holomorphic in the cut plane with and excluding the point .&quot;

This cut is slightly different from the we&#x27;ve already encountered, because it actually the negative real axis from the cut plane. The branch cut left the real axis connected with the cut plane on one side , but severed it from the cut plane along the other side .

Of course, it&#x27;s not actually necessary to exclude the entire line segment from to to construct a domain in which is holomorphic. All we really have to do is the plane at a countably infinite set of points . But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle one or more of the poles of , giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. Cutting the complex plane ensures not only that is holomorphic in this restricted domain – but also that the contour integral of the gamma function over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.

===Specifying convergence regions===
Many complex functions are defined by infinite series, or by continued fractions. A fundamental consideration in the analysis of these infinitely long expressions is identifying the portion of the complex plane in which they converge to a finite value. A cut in the plane may facilitate this process, as the following examples show.

Consider the function defined by the infinite series

formula_12

Because for every complex number , it&#x27;s clear that is an even function of , so the analysis can be restricted to one half of the complex plane. And since the series is undefined when

formula_13

it makes sense to cut the plane along the entire imaginary axis and establish the convergence of this series where the real part of is not zero before undertaking the more arduous task of examining when is a pure imaginary number.

In this example the cut is a mere convenience, because the points at which the infinite sum is undefined are isolated, and the plane can be replaced with a suitably plane. In some contexts the cut is necessary, and not just convenient. Consider the infinite periodic continued fraction

formula_14

It can be shown that converges to a finite value if is not a negative real number such that . In other words, the convergence region for this continued fraction is the cut plane, where the cut runs along the negative real axis, from − to the point at infinity.

==Gluing the cut plane back together==
We have already seen how the relationship

formula_15

can be made into a single-valued function by splitting the domain of into two disconnected sheets. It is also possible to &quot;glue&quot; those two sheets back together to form a single Riemann surface on which can be defined as a holomorphic function whose image is the entire -plane (except for the point ). Here&#x27;s how that works.

Imagine two copies of the cut complex plane, the cuts extending along the positive real axis from to the point at infinity. On one sheet define , so that , by definition. On the second sheet define , so that , again by definition. Now flip the second sheet upside down, so the imaginary axis points in the opposite direction of the imaginary axis on the first sheet, with both real axes pointing in the same direction, and &quot;glue&quot; the two sheets together (so that the edge on the first sheet labeled &quot; is connected to the edge labeled &quot; on the second sheet, and the edge on the second sheet labeled &quot; is connected to the edge labeled &quot; on the first sheet). The result is the Riemann surface domain on which is single-valued and holomorphic (except when ).

To understand why is single-valued in this domain, imagine a circuit around the unit circle, starting with on the first sheet. When we are still on the first sheet. When we have crossed over onto the second sheet, and are obliged to make a second complete circuit around the branch point before returning to our starting point, where is equivalent to , because of the way we glued the two sheets together. In other words, as the variable makes two complete turns around the branch point, the image of in the -plane traces out just one complete circle.

Formal differentiation shows that

formula_16

from which we can conclude that the derivative of exists and is finite everywhere on the Riemann surface, except when (that is, is holomorphic, except when ).

How can the Riemann surface for the function

formula_17

also discussed above, be constructed? Once again we begin with two copies of the -plane, but this time each one is cut along the real line segment extending from to – these are the two branch points of . We flip one of these upside down, so the two imaginary axes point in opposite directions, and glue the corresponding edges of the two cut sheets together. We can verify that is a single-valued function on this surface by tracing a circuit around a circle of unit radius centered at . Commencing at the point on the first sheet we turn halfway around the circle before encountering the cut at . The cut forces us onto the second sheet, so that when has traced out one full turn around the branch point , has taken just one-half of a full turn, the sign of has been reversed (because ), and our path has taken us to the point on the sheet of the surface. Continuing on through another half turn we encounter the other side of the cut, where , and finally reach our starting point ( on the sheet) after making two full turns around the branch point.

The natural way to label in this example is to set on the first sheet, with on the second. The imaginary axes on the two sheets point in opposite directions so that the counterclockwise sense of positive rotation is preserved as a closed contour moves from one sheet to the other (remember, the second sheet is ). Imagine this surface embedded in a three-dimensional space, with both sheets parallel to the -plane. Then there appears to be a vertical hole in the surface, where the two cuts are joined. What if the cut is made from down the real axis to the point at infinity, and from , up the real axis until the cut meets itself? Again a Riemann surface can be constructed, but this time the &quot;hole&quot; is horizontal. Topologically speaking, both versions of this Riemann surface are equivalent – they are orientable two-dimensional surfaces of genus one.

==Use in control theory==
In control theory, one use of the complex plane is known as the &quot;s-plane&quot;. It is used to visualise the roots of the equation describing a system&#x27;s behaviour (the characteristic equation) graphically. The equation is normally expressed as a polynomial in the parameter of the Laplace transform, hence the name -plane. Points in the s-plane take the form , where &quot; is used instead of the usual &quot; to represent the imaginary component (the variable &quot; is often used to denote electrical current in engineering contexts).

Another related use of the complex plane is with the Nyquist stability criterion. This is a geometric principle which allows the stability of a closed-loop feedback system to be determined by inspecting a Nyquist plot of its open-loop magnitude and phase response as a function of frequency (or loop transfer function) in the complex plane.

The -plane is a discrete-time version of the -plane, where -transforms are used instead of the Laplace transformation.

==Quadratic spaces==
The complex plane is associated with two distinct quadratic spaces. For a point in the complex plane, the squaring function and the norm-squared are both quadratic forms. The former is frequently neglected in the wake of the latter&#x27;s use in setting a metric on the complex plane. These distinct faces of the complex plane as a quadratic space arise in the construction of algebras over a field with the Cayley–Dickson process. That procedure can be applied to any field, and different results occur for the fields R and C: when R is the take-off field, then C is constructed with the quadratic form , but the process can also begin with C and , and that case generates algebras that differ from those derived from R. In any case, the algebras generated are composition algebras; in this case the complex plane is the point set for two distinct composition algebras.

==Other meanings of &quot;complex plane&quot;==
The preceding sections of this article deal with the complex plane in terms of a geometric representation of the complex numbers. Although this usage of the term &quot;complex plane&quot; has a long and mathematically rich history, it is by no means the only mathematical concept that can be characterized as &quot;the complex plane&quot;. There are at least three additional possibilities.
#Two-dimensional complex vector space, a &quot;complex plane&quot; in the sense that it is a two-dimensional vector space whose coordinates are &quot;complex numbers&quot;. See also: .
#-dimensional Minkowski space, also known as the split-complex plane, is a &quot;complex plane&quot; in the sense that the algebraic split-complex numbers can be separated into two real components that are easily associated with the point in the Cartesian plane.
#The set of dual numbers over the reals can also be placed into one-to-one correspondence with the points of the Cartesian plane, and represent another example of a &quot;complex plane&quot;.

<doc id="217631" wikidata="Q1414874" url="?curid=217631" title="Comorbidity">
<text>In medicine, comorbidity refers to the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions in a patient; often (that is, or ) with a primary condition. It originates from the Latin term (meaning &quot;sickness&quot;) prefixed with (&quot;together&quot;) and suffixed with &quot;-ity&quot; (to indicate a state or condition). Comorbidity includes all additional ailments a patient may experience alongside their primary diagnosis, which can be either physiological or psychological in nature. In the context of mental health, comorbidity frequently refers to the concurrent existence of mental disorders, for example, the co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders. The concept of multimorbidity is related to comorbidity but is different in its definition and approach, focusing on the presence of multiple diseases or conditions in a patient without the need to specify one as primary.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;comorbid&quot; has three definitions:
# to indicate a medical condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition in a patient.
# to indicate a medical condition in a patient that causes, is caused by, or is otherwise related to another condition in the same patient.
# to indicate two or more medical conditions existing simultaneously regardless of their causal relationship.
Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy. In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this &quot;&#x27;use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking&#x27;, [and] this usage of the term &#x27;comorbidity&#x27; should probably be avoided.&quot; However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.

=== Difference from multimorbidity ===
Comorbidity is often referred to as multimorbidity even though the two are considered distinct clinical scenarios.

Comorbidity means that one &#x27;index&#x27; condition is the focus of attention, and others are viewed in relation to this. In contrast, multimorbidity describes someone having two or more long-term (chronic) conditions without any of them holding priority over the others. This distinction is important in how the healthcare system treats people and helps making clear the specific settings in which the use of one or the other term can be preferred. Multimorbidity offers a more general and person-centered concept that allows focusing on all of the patient&#x27;s symptoms and providing a more holistic care. In other settings, for example in pharmaceutical research, comorbidity might often be the more useful term to use.

== Mental health ==

In psychiatry, psychology, and mental health counseling, comorbidity refers to the presence of more than one diagnosis occurring in an individual at the same time. However, in psychiatric classification, comorbidity does not necessarily imply the presence of multiple diseases, but instead can reflect current inability to supply a single diagnosis accounting for all symptoms. On the DSM Axis I, major depressive disorder is a very common comorbid disorder. The Axis II personality disorders are often criticized because their comorbidity rates are excessively high, approaching 60% in some cases. Critics assert this indicates these categories of mental illness are too imprecisely distinguished to be usefully valid for diagnostic purposes, impacting treatment and resource allocation. Symptom overlap is a key component against DSM classification and serves as a note towards redefining criteria in disorders that the root cause may not be understood thoroughly. Regardless of criticisms, it stands that, annually, up to 45% of mental health patients fit the criteria for a comorbid diagnosis. A comorbid diagnosis is associated with more severe symptomatic expression and greater chance of dismal prognosis. Certain diagnoses such as ADHD, autism, OCD, and mood disorders have higher rates of co-occurring or being prevalent in separate diagnoses. &quot;Comorbidity in OCD is the rule rather than the exception&quot; with OCD diagnoses facing a lifetime rate of 90%. With overlapping symptoms comes overlap in treatment as well, CBT for example is common for both ADHD and OCD with pediatric onset and can be effective for both in a comorbid diagnosis. OCD and eating disorders have a high rate of occurrence, it is estimated that 20-60% of patients with an eating disorder have OCD. More often, comorbidity complicates and can prevent treatment efficacy on a varying scale depending on the circumstances.

The term &#x27;comorbidity&#x27; was introduced in medicine by Feinstein (1970) to describe cases in which a &#x27;distinct additional clinical entity&#x27; occurred before or during treatment for the &#x27;index disease&#x27;, the original or primary diagnosis. Since the terms were coined, meta studies have shown that criteria used to determine the index disease were flawed and subjective, and moreover, trying to identify an index disease as the cause of the others can be counterproductive to understanding and treating interdependent conditions. In response, &#x27;multimorbidity&#x27; was introduced to describe concurrent conditions without relativity to or implied dependency on another disease, so that the complex interactions to emerge naturally under analysis of the system as a whole.

Although the term &#x27;comorbidity&#x27; has recently become very fashionable in psychiatry, its use to indicate the concomitance of two or more psychiatric diagnoses is said to be incorrect because in most cases it is unclear whether the concomitant diagnoses actually reflect the presence of distinct clinical entities or refer to multiple manifestations of a single clinical entity. It has been argued that because &quot;&#x27;the use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking&#x27;, this usage of the term &#x27;comorbidity&#x27; should probably be avoided&quot;.

Due to its artifactual nature, psychiatric comorbidity has been considered as a Kuhnian anomaly leading the DSM to a scientific crisis and a comprehensive review on the matter considers comorbidity as an epistemological challenge to modern psychiatry. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology is a leading alternative classification system that addresses these concerns about comorbidity.

== History ==

Widespread study of physical and mental pathology found its place in psychiatry. I. Jensen (1975), J.H. Boyd (1984), W.C. Sanderson (1990), Yuri Nuller (1993), D.L. Robins (1994), A. B. Smulevich (1997), C.R. Cloninger (2002) and other psychiatrists discovered a number of comorbid conditions in those with psychiatric disorders.

The influence of comorbidity on the clinical progression of the primary (basic) physical disorder, effectiveness of the medicinal therapy and immediate and long-term prognosis of the patients was researched by physicians and scientists of various medical fields in many countries across the globe. These scientists and physicians included: M. H. Kaplan (1974), T. Pincus (1986), M. E. Charlson (1987), F. G. Schellevis (1993), H. C. Kraemer (1995), M. van den Akker (1996), A. Grimby (1997), S. Greenfield (1999), M. Fortin (2004) &amp; A. Vanasse (2004), C. Hudon (2005), L. B. Lazebnik (2005), A. L. Vertkin (2008), G. E. Caughey (2008), F. I. Belyalov (2009), L. A. Luchikhin (2010) and many others.

=== Inception of the term ===
Many centuries ago the doctors propagated the viability of a complex approach in the diagnosis of disease and the treatment of the patient, however, modern medicine, which boasts a wide range of diagnostic methods and a variety of therapeutic procedures, stresses specification. This brought up a question: How to wholly evaluate the state of a patient who has a number of diseases simultaneously, where to start from and which disease(s) require(s) primary and subsequent treatment? For many years this question stood out unanswered, until 1970, when a renowned American doctor epidemiologist and researcher, A.R. Feinstein, who had greatly influenced the methods of clinical diagnosis and particularly methods used in the field of clinical epidemiology, came out with the term of &quot;comorbidity&quot;. The appearance of comorbidity was demonstrated by Feinstein using the example of patients physically affected by rheumatic fever, discovering the worst state of the patients, who simultaneously had multiple diseases. In due course of time after its discovery, comorbidity was distinguished as a separate scientific-research discipline in many branches of medicine.

=== Evolution of the term ===
Presently there is no agreed-upon terminology of comorbidity. Some authors bring forward different meanings of comorbidity and multi-morbidity, defining the former, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, connected to each other through proven pathogenetic mechanisms and the latter, as the presence of a number of diseases in a patient, not having any connection to each other through any of the proven to date pathogenetic mechanisms. Others affirm that multi-morbidity is the combination of a number of chronic or acute diseases and clinical symptoms in a person and do not stress the similarities or differences in their pathogenesis. However the principle clarification of the term was given by H. C. Kraemer and M. van den Akker, determining comorbidity as the combination in a patient of 2 or more chronic diseases (disorders), pathogenetically related to each other or coexisting in a single patient independent of each disease&#x27;s activity in the patient.

== Synonyms ==
* Polymorbidity
* Multifactorial diseases
* Polypathy
* Dual diagnosis, used for mental health issues
* Pluralpathology

== Epidemiology ==
Comorbidity is widespread among the patients admitted at multidiscipline hospitals. During the phase of initial medical help, the patients having multiple diseases simultaneously are a norm rather than an exception. Prevention and treatment of chronic diseases declared by the World Health Organization, as a priority project for the second decade of the 20th century, are meant to better the quality of the global population. This is the reason for an overall tendency of large-scale epidemiological researches in different medical fields, carried-out using serious statistical data. In most of the carried-out, randomized, clinical researches the authors study patients with single refined pathology, making comorbidity an exclusive criterion. This is why it is hard to relate researches, directed towards the evaluation of the combination of ones or the other separate disorders, to works regarding the sole research of comorbidity. The absence of a single scientific approach to the evaluation of comorbidity leads to omissions in clinical practice. It is hard not to notice the absence of comorbidity in the taxonomy (systematics) of disease, presented in ICD-10.

=== Clinico-pathological comparisons ===
All the fundamental researches of medical documentation, directed towards the study of the spread of comorbidity and influence of its structure, were conducted until the 1990s. The sources of information, used by the researchers and scientists, working on the matter of comorbidity, were case histories, hospital records of patients and other medical documentation, kept by family doctors, insurance companies and even in the archives of patients in old houses.

The listed methods of obtaining medical information are mainly based on clinical experience and qualification of the physicians, carrying out clinically, instrumentally and laboratorially confirmed diagnosis. This is why despite their competence, they are highly subjective. No analysis of the results of postmortem of deceased patients was carried out for any of the comorbidity researches.

&quot;It is the duty of the doctor to carry out autopsy of the patients they treat&quot;, said once professor M. Y. Mudrov. Autopsy allows you to exactly determine the structure of comorbidity and the direct cause of death of each patient independent of his/her age, gender and gender specific characteristics. Statistical data of comorbid pathology, based on these sections, are mainly devoid of subjectivism.

=== Research ===
The analysis of a decade long Australian research based on the study of patients having 6 widespread chronic diseases demonstrated that nearly half of the elderly patients with arthritis also had hypertension, 20% had cardiac disorders and 14% had type 2 diabetes. More than 60% of asthmatic patients complained of concurrent arthritis, 20% complained of cardiac problems and 16% had type 2 diabetes.

In patients with chronic kidney disease (renal insufficiency) the frequency of coronary heart disease is 22% higher and new coronary events 3.4 times higher compared to patients without kidney function disorders. Progression of CKD towards end stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy is accompanied by increasing prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease and sudden death from cardiac arrest.

A Canadian research conducted upon 483 obesity patients, it was determined that spread of obesity related accompanying diseases was higher among females than males. The researchers discovered that nearly 75% of obesity patients had accompanying diseases, which mostly included dyslipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Among the young obesity patients (from 18 to 29) more than two chronic diseases were found in 22% males and 43% females.

Fibromyalgia is a condition which is comorbid with several others, including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, and panic disorder.

The number of comorbid diseases increases with age. Comorbidity increases by 10% in ages up to 19 years, up to 80% in people of ages 80 and older. According to data by M. Fortin, based on the analysis of 980 case histories, taken from daily practice of a family doctor, the spread of comorbidity is from 69% in young patients, up to 93% among middle aged people and up to 98% patients of older age groups. At the same time the number of chronic diseases varies from 2.8 in young patients and 6.4 among older patients.

According to Russian data, based on the study of more than three thousand postmortem reports (n=3239) of patients of physical pathologies, admitted at multidisciplinary hospitals for the treatment of chronic disorders (average age 67.8 ± 11.6 years), the frequency of comorbidity is 94.2%. Doctors mostly come across a combination of two to three disorders, but in rare cases (up to 2.7%) a single patient carried a combination of 6–8 diseases simultaneously.

The fourteen-year research conducted on 883 patients of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Werlhof disease), conducted in Great Britain, shows that the given disease is related to a wide range of physical pathologies. In the comorbid structure of these patients, most frequently present are malignant neoplasms, locomotorium disorders, skin and genitourinary system disorders, as well as haemorrhagic complications and other autoimmune diseases, the risk of whose progression during the first five years of the primary disease exceeds the limit of 5%.

In a research conducted on 196 larynx cancer patients, it was determined that the survival rate of patients at various stages of cancer differs depending upon the presence or absence of comorbidity. At the first stage of cancer the survival rate in the presence of comorbidity is 17% and in its absence it is 83%, in the second stage of cancer the rate of survivability is 14% and 76%, in the third stage it is 28% and 66% and in the fourth stage of cancer it is 0% and 50% respectively. Overall the survivability rate of comorbid larynx cancer patients is 59% lower than the survivability rate of patients without comorbidity.

Except for therapists and general physicians, the problem of comorbidity is also often faced by specialists. Regretfully they seldom pay attention to the coexistence of a whole range of disorders in a single patient and mostly conduct the treatment of specific to their specialization diseases. In current practice urologists, gynecologists, ENT specialists, eye specialists, surgeons and other specialists all too often mention only the diseases related to &quot;own&quot; field of specialization, passing on the discovery of other accompanying pathologies &quot;under the control&quot; of other specialists. It has become an unspoken rule for any specialized department to carry out consultations of the therapist, who feels obliged to carry out symptomatic analysis of the patient, as well as to the form the diagnostic and therapeutic concept, taking in view the potential risks for the patient and his long-term prognosis.

Based on the available clinical and scientific data it is possible to conclude that comorbidity has a range of undoubted properties, which characterize it as a heterogeneous and often encountered event, which enhances the seriousness of the condition and worsens the patient&#x27;s prospects. The heterogeneous character of comorbidity is due to the wide range of reasons causing it.

== Causes ==
* Anatomic proximity of diseased organs
* Singular pathogenetic mechanism of a number of diseases
* Terminable cause-effect relation between the diseases
* One disease resulting from complications of another
* Pleiotropy

The factors responsible for the development of comorbidity can be chronic infections, inflammations, involutional and systematic metabolic changes, iatrogenesis, social status, ecology and genetic susceptibility.

== Types ==
* Trans-syndromal comorbidity: coexistence, in a single patient, of two and/or more syndromes, pathogenetically related to each other.
* Trans-nosological comorbidity: coexistence, in a single patient, of two and/or more syndromes, pathogenetically not related to each other.
The division of comorbidity as per syndromal and nosological principles is mainly preliminary and inaccurate, however it allows us to understand that comorbidity can be connected to a singular cause or common mechanisms of pathogenesis of the conditions, which sometimes explains the similarity in their clinical aspects, which makes it difficult to differentiate between nosologies.
* Etiological comorbidity: It is caused by concurrent damage to different organs and systems, which is caused by a singular pathological agent (for example due to alcoholism in patients with chronic alcohol intoxication; pathologies associated with smoking; systematic damage due to collagenoses).
* Complicated comorbidity: It is the result of the primary disease and often subsequent after sometime after its destabilization appears in the shape of target lesions (for example chronic nephratony resulting from diabetic nephropathy (Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease) in patients with type 2 diabetes; development of brain infarction resulting from complications due to hypertensive crisis in patients with hypertension).
* Iatrogenic comorbidity: It appears as a result of necessitated negative effect of the doctor on the patient, under the conditions of pre determine danger of one or the other medical procedure (for example, glucocorticosteroid osteoporosis in patients treated for a long time using systematic hormonal agents (preparations); drug-induced hepatitis resulting from chemotherapy against TB, prescribed due to the conversion of tubercular tests).
* Unspecified (NOS) comorbidity: This type assumes the presence of singular pathogenetic mechanisms of development of diseases, comprising this combination, but require a number of tests, proving the hypothesis of the researcher or physician (for example, erectile dysfunction as an early sign of general atherosclerosis (ASVD); occurrence of erosive-ulcerative lesions in the mucous membrane of the upper gastrointestinal tract in &quot;vascular&quot; patients).
* &quot;Arbitrary&quot; comorbidity: initial alogism of the combination of diseases is not proven, but soon can be explained with clinical and scientific point of view (for example, combination of coronary heart disease (CHD) and choledocholithiasis; combination of acquired heart valvular disease and psoriasis).

== Structure ==
There are a number of rules for the formulation of clinical diagnosis for comorbid patients, which must be followed by a practitioner. The main principle is to distinguish in diagnosis the primary and background diseases, as well as their complications and accompanying pathologies.
* Primary disease: This is the nosological form, which itself or as a result of complications calls for the foremost necessity for treatment at the time due to threat to the patient&#x27;s life and danger of disability. Primary is the disease, which becomes the cause of seeking medical help or the reason for the patient&#x27;s death. If the patient has several primary diseases it is important to first of all understand the combined primary diseases (rival or concomitant).
* Rival diseases: These are the concurrent nosological forms in a patient, interdependent in etiologies and pathogenesis, but equally sharing the criterion of a primary disease (for example, transmural myocardial infarction and massive thromboembolism of pulmonary artery, caused by phlebemphraxis of lower limbs). For practicing pathologist rival are two or more diseases, exhibited in a single patient, each of which by itself or through its complications could cause the patient&#x27;s death.
* Polypathia: Diseases with different etiologies and pathogenesis, each of which separately could not cause death, but, concurring during development and reciprocally exacerbating each other, they cause the patient&#x27;s death (for example, osteoporotic fracture of the surgical neck of the femur and hypostatic pneumonia).
* Background disease: This helps in the occurrence of or adverse development of the primary disease increases its dangers and helps in the development of complications. This disease as well as the primary one requires immediate treatment (for example, type 2 diabetes).
* Complications: Nosologies having pathogenetic relation to the primary disease, supporting the adverse progression of the disorder, causing acute worsening of the patient&#x27;s conditions (are a part of the complicated comorbidity). In a number of cases the complications of the primary disease and related to it etiological and pathogenetic factors, are indicated as conjugated disease. In this case they must be identified as the cause of comorbidity. Complications are listed in a descending order of prognostic or disabling significance.
* Associating diseases: Nosological units not connected etiologically and pathogenetically with the primary disease (Listed in the order of significance).

== Diagnosis ==
Many tests attempt to standardize the &quot;weight&quot; or value of comorbid conditions, whether they are secondary or tertiary illnesses. Each test attempts to consolidate each individual comorbid condition into a single, predictive variable that measures mortality or other outcomes. Researchers have validated such tests because of their predictive value, but no one test is as yet recognized as a standard.

=== Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ===

The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts the mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer (a total of 17 conditions). Each condition is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of dying associated with each one. Scores are summed to provide a total score to predict mortality. Many variations of the Charlson comorbidity index have been presented, including the Charlson/Deyo, Charlson/Romano, Charlson/Manitoba, and Charlson/D&#x27;Hoores comorbidity indices.

For a physician, this score is helpful in deciding how aggressively to treat a condition. For example, a patient may have cancer with comorbid heart disease and diabetes. These comorbidities may be so severe that the costs and risks of cancer treatment would outweigh its short-term benefit.

Since patients often do not know how severe their conditions are, nurses were originally supposed to review a patient&#x27;s chart and determine whether a particular condition was present in order to calculate the index. Subsequent studies have adapted the comorbidity index into a questionnaire for patients.

The Charlson index, especially the Charlson/Deyo, followed by the Elixhauser have been most commonly referred by the comparative studies of comorbidity and multimorbidity measures.

=== Comorbidity–Polypharmacy Score (CPS) ===
The comorbidity–polypharmacy score (CPS) is a simple measure that consists of the sum of all known comorbid conditions and all associated medications. There is no specific matching between comorbid conditions and corresponding medications. Instead, the number of medications is assumed to be a reflection of the &quot;intensity&quot; of the associated comorbid conditions. This score has been tested and validated extensively in the trauma population, demonstrating good correlation with mortality, morbidity, triage, and hospital readmissions. Of interest, increasing levels of CPS were associated with significantly lower 90-day survival in the original study of the score in trauma population.

=== Elixhauser Comorbidity Index ===
The Elixhauser comorbidity measure was developed using administrative data from a statewide California inpatient database from all non-federal inpatient community hospital stays in California (&quot;n&quot; = 1,779,167). The Elixhauser comorbidity measure developed a list of 30 comorbidities relying on the ICD-9-CM coding manual. The comorbidities were not simplified as an index because each comorbidity affected outcomes (length of hospital stay, hospital changes, and mortality) differently among different patients groups. The comorbidities identified by the Elixhauser comorbidity measure are significantly associated with in-hospital mortality and include both acute and chronic conditions. van Walraven et al. have derived and validated an Elixhauser comorbidity index that summarizes disease burden and can discriminate for in-hospital mortality. In addition, a systematic review and comparative analysis shows that among various comorbidities indices, Elixhauser index is a better predictor of the risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalization.

=== Diagnosis-related group ===
Patients who are more seriously ill tend to require more hospital resources than patients who are less seriously ill, even though they are admitted to the hospital for the same reason. Recognizing this, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) manually splits certain DRGs based on the presence of secondary diagnoses for specific complications or comorbidities (CC). The same applies to Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) in the UK.

=== Clinical example of evaluation ===
Patient S., 73 years, called an ambulance because of a sudden pressing pain in the chest. It was known from the case history that the patient had CHD for many years. Such chest pains were experienced by her earlier as well, but they always disappeared after a few minutes of sublingual administration of organic nitrates. This time taking three tablets of nitroglycerine did not kill the pain. It was also known from the case history that the patient had twice had myocardial infarctions during the last ten years, as well as had an Acute Cerebrovascular Event with sinistral hemiplegia more than 15 years ago. Apart from that the patient had hypertension, type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy, hysteromyoma, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis and varicose pedi-vein disease. It was also learned that the patient regularly takes a number of antihypertensive drugs, urinatives and oral antihyperglycemic remedies, as well as statins, antiplatelet and nootropics. In the past the patient had undergone cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis more than 20 years ago, as well as the extraction of a cataract of the right eye 4 years ago. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at a general hospital diagnosed for acute transmural myocardial infarction. During the check-up moderate azotemia, mild erythronormoblastic anemia, proteinuria and lowering of left vascular ejection fraction were also identified.

=== Methods of evaluation ===
There are currently several generally accepted methods of evaluating (measuring) comorbidity:

# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS): Developed in 1968 by B. S. Linn, it became a revolutionary discovery, because it gave the practicing doctors a chance to calculate the number and severity of chronic illnesses in the structure of the comorbid state of their patients. The proper use of CIRS means separate cumulative evaluation of each of the biological systems: &quot;0&quot; The selected system corresponds to the absence of disorders, &quot;1&quot;: Slight (mild) abnormalities or previously had disorders, &quot;2&quot;: Illness requiring the prescription of medicinal therapy, &quot;3&quot;: Disease, which caused disability and &quot;4&quot;: Acute organ insufficiency requiring emergency therapy. The CIRS system evaluates comorbidity in cumulative score, which can be from 0 to 56. As per its developers, the maximum score is not compatible with the patient&#x27;s life.
# Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G): This system is similar to CIRS, but for aged patients, offered by M. D. Miller in 1991. This system takes into account the age of the patient and the peculiarities of the old age disorders.
# The Kaplan–Feinstein Index: This index was created in 1973 based on the study of the effect of the associated diseases on patients with type 2 diabetes during a period of 5 years. In this system of comorbidity evaluation all the present (in a patient) diseases and their complications, depending on the level of their damaging effect on body organs, are classified as mild, moderate and severe. In this case the conclusion about cumulative comorbidity is drawn on the basis of the most decompensated biological system. This index gives cumulative, but less detailed as compared to CIRS, assessment of the condition of each of the biological systems: &quot;0&quot;: Absence of disease, &quot;1&quot;: Mild course of the disease, &quot;2&quot;: Moderate disease, &quot;3&quot;: Severe disease. The Kaplan–Feinstein Index evaluates comorbidity by cumulative score, which can vary from 0 to 36. Apart from that the notable deficiency of this method of evaluating comorbidity is the excessive generalization of diseases (nosologies) and the absence of a large number of illnesses in the scale, which, probably, should be noted in the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; column, which undermines (decreases) this method&#x27;s objectivity and productivity of this method. However the indisputable advantage of the Kaplan–Feinstein Index as compared to CIRS is in the capability of independent analysis of malignant neoplasms and their severities. &quot;Using this method patient S&#x27;s, age 73, comorbidity can be evaluated as of moderate severity (16 out of 36 points), however its prognostic value is unclear, because of the absence of the interpretation of the overall score, resulting from the accumulation of the patient&#x27;s diseases&quot;.
# Charlson Index: This index is meant for the long-term prognosis of comorbid patients and was developed by M. E. Charlson in 1987. This index is based on a point scoring system (from 0 to 40) for the presence of specific associated diseases and is used for prognosis of lethality. For its calculation the points are accumulated, according to associated diseases, as well as the addition of a single point for each 10 years of age for patients of ages above forty years (in 50 years 1 point, 60 years 2 points etc.). The distinguishing feature and undisputed advantage of the Charlson Index is the capability of evaluating the patient&#x27;s age and determination of the patient&#x27;s mortality rate, which in the absence of comorbidity is 12%, at 1–2 points it is 26%; at 3–4 points it is 52% and with the accumulation of more than 5 points it is 85%. Regretfully this method has some deficiencies: Evaluating comorbidity severity of many diseases is not considered, as well as the absence of many important for prognosis disorders. Apart from that it is doubtful that possible prognosis for a patient with bronchial asthma and chronic leukemia is comparable to the prognosis for the patient ailing from myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. &quot;In this case comorbidity of patient S, 73 years of age according to this method, is equivalent to mild state (9 out of 40 points)&quot;.
# Modified Charlson Index: R. A. Deyo, D. C. Cherkin, and Marcia Ciol added chronic forms of ischemic cardiac disorder and the stages of chronic cardiac insufficiency to this index in 1992.
# Elixhauser Index: The Elixhauser comorbidity measure include 30 comorbidities, which are not simplified as an index. Elixhauser shows a better predictive performance for mortality risk especially beyond 30 days of hospitalization.
# Index of Co-Existent Disease (ICED): This Index was first developed in 1993 by S. Greenfield to evaluate comorbidity in patients with malignant neoplasms, later it also became useful for other categories of patients. This method helps in calculating the duration of a patient&#x27;s stay at a hospital and the risks of repeated admittance of the same at a hospital after going through surgical procedures. For the evaluation of comorbidity the ICED index suggests to evaluate the patient&#x27;s condition separately as per two different components: Physiological functional characteristics. The first component comprises 19 associated disorders, each of which is assessed on a 4-point scale, where &quot;0&quot; indicates the absence of disease and &quot;3&quot; indicates the disease&#x27;s severe form. The second component evaluates the effect of associated diseases on the physical condition of the patient. It assesses 11 physical functions using a 3-point scale, where &quot;0&quot; means normal functionality and &quot;2&quot; means the impossibility of functionality.
# Geriatric Index of Comorbidity (GIC): Developed in 2002
# Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI): Developed in 2005.
# Total Illness Burden Index (TIBI): Developed in 2007.
Analyzing the comorbid state of patient S, 73 years of age, using the most used international comorbidity assessment scales, a doctor would come across totally different evaluation. The uncertainty of these results would somewhat complicate the doctors judgment about the factual level of severity of the patient&#x27;s condition and would complicate the process of prescribing rational medicinal therapy for the identified disorders. Such problems are faced by doctors on everyday basis, despite all their knowledge about medical science. The main hurdle in the way of inducting comorbidity evaluation systems in broad based diagnostic-therapeutic process is their inconsistency and narrow focus. Despite the variety of methods of evaluation of comorbidity, the absence of a singular generally accepted method, devoid of the deficiencies of the available methods of its evaluation, causes disturbance. The absence of a unified instrument, developed on the basis of colossal international experience, as well as the methodology of its use does not allow comorbidity to become doctor &quot;friendly&quot;. At the same time due to the inconsistency in approach to the analysis of comorbid state and absence of components of comorbidity in medical university courses, the practitioner is unclear about its prognostic effect, which makes the generally available systems of associated pathology evaluation unreasoned and therefore un-needed as well.

== Treatment of comorbid patient ==
The effect of comorbid pathologies on clinical implications, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of many diseases is polyhedral and patient-specific. The interrelation of the disease, age and drug pathomorphism greatly affect the clinical presentation and progress of the primary nosology, character and severity of the complications, worsens the patient&#x27;s life quality and limit or make difficult the remedial-diagnostic process. Comorbidity affects life prognosis and increases the chances of fatality. The presence of comorbid disorders increases bed days, disability, hinders rehabilitation, increases the number of complications after surgical procedures, and increases the chances of decline in aged people.

The presence of comorbidity must be taken into account when selecting the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment plans for any given disease. It is important to enquire comorbid patients about the level of functional disorders and anatomic status of all the identified nosological forms (diseases). Whenever a new, as well as mildly notable symptom appears, it is necessary to conduct a deep examination to uncover its causes. It is also necessary to be remembered that comorbidity leads to polypragmasy (polypharmacy), i.e. simultaneous prescription of a large number of medicines, which renders impossible the control over the effectiveness of the therapy, increases monetary expenses and therefore reduces compliance. At the same time, polypragmasy, especially in aged patients, renders possible the sudden development of local and systematic, unwanted medicinal side-effects. These side-effects are not always considered by the doctors, because they are considered as the appearance of comorbidity and as a result become the reason for the prescription of even more drugs, sealing-in the vicious circle. Simultaneous treatment of multiple disorders requires strict consideration of compatibility of drugs and detailed adherence of rules of rational drug therapy, based on E. M. Tareev&#x27;s principles, which state: &quot;Each non-indicated drug is contraindicated&quot; and B. E. Votchal said: &quot;If the drug does not have any side-effects, one must think if there is any effect at all&quot;.

A study of inpatient hospital data in the United States in 2011 showed that the presence of a major complication or comorbidity was associated with a great risk of intensive-care unit utilization, ranging from a negligible change for acute myocardial infarction with major complication or comorbidity to nearly nine times more likely for a major joint replacement with major complication or comorbidity.

<text>In the botanical classification of plants, Aeridinae Pfitzer is a subtribe of the tribe [[Vandeae]] (Family Orchidaceae) whose representatives all have a monopodial growth habit and do not possess pseudobulbs.

This subtribe is a monophyletic group within Vandeae, and it contains more than 1,300 species in 103 genera, including about 208 (38%) hybrid genera. They occur mostly in Asia with a few in Africa. They are distinguished from the other subtribes of Vandeae by having an entire rostellum, a relatively small spur formed by the lip, and four (or two) pollinia.

Some of the genera it contains have some of the largest and most spectacular flowers in the whole of the orchid family. Also included in this subtribe are some of the most economically important genera in the horticultural trade, such as &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; and &quot;Vanda&quot;.

== Leaflessness ==
Aeridinae contains the largest diversity of leafless taxa within the tribe Vandeae. These leafless species of the genera &quot;Chiloschista&quot;, &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, and &quot;Taeniophyllum&quot; (syn. &quot;Microtatorchis&quot;), which is the most species rich genus of Aeridinae with 245 accepted species, exhibit reduced stems and enhanced importance and photosynthetic function of the root system. This extreme reduction of leaves has likely evolved in three to four separate instances within Aeridinae. These leafless genera have a tight relationship with fungi of the &quot;Ceratobasidiaceae &quot; family. The roots of leafless epiphytic orchids are also heavily colonized by nitrogen-fixating cyanobacteria, which are thought to supply the plants with nitrogen.


==Taxonomy==
It was published by Pfitzer in 1887 with &quot;Aerides&quot; Lour. as the type genus.It has multiple synonyms:

*Deceptorinae Szlach.
*Diplocentrinae Szlach.
*Gastrochilinae Szlach.
*Pelatantheriinae Szlach.
*Phalaenopsidinae Szlach.
*Sarcanthinae Benth.
*Taeniophyllinae Szlach.
*Vandinae Rchb. f.

== Phylogeny ==
The subtribe Aeridinae is the sister group to the subtribe Angraecinae (incl. Aerangidinae):

<text>Length of stay (LOS) is the duration of a single episode of hospitalization. Inpatient days are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge.

==Analysis==
A common statistic associated with length of stay is the average length of stay (ALOS), a mean calculated by dividing the sum of inpatient days by the number of patients admissions with the same diagnosis-related group classification. A variation in the calculation of ALOS can be to consider only length of stay during the period under analysis.

Length of stay is typically highly skewed and so statistical approaches taking that into account are recommended. While the mean length of stay is useful from the point of view of costs, it may be a poor statistic in terms of representing a typical length of stay, and the median may be preferred.

It is useful to be able to predict an individual&#x27;s expected length of stay or to model length of stay to determine factors that affect it. Various analyses have sought to model length of stay in different condition contexts. This has usually been done with regression models, but Markov chain methods have also been applied. Within regression approaches, linear, log-normal and logistic regression approaches have been applied, but have been criticised by other researchers. Carter &amp; Potts (2014) instead recommend use of negative binomial regression.

==Quality metric==
Length of stay is commonly used as a quality metric. The prospective payment system in U.S. Medicare for reimbursing hospital care promotes shorter length of stay by paying the same amount for procedures, regardless of days spent in the hospital.

Additionally, length of stay in hospital can be linked to additional quality metrics such as patient satisfaction with health professionals, reduction in hospital readmissions, and even mortality. Discharge planning processes can be effective in reducing a patient&#x27;s length of stay in hospital. For example, for older people admitted with a medical condition, discharge planning has been shown to improve satisfaction, reduce the overall length of stay, and within 3-month period reduce the likelihood of readmission. This phenomenon reflects the principles of Goodhart&#x27;s Law, which states that &quot;when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot; In the context of healthcare, overemphasis on LOS as a target metric can compromise the quality of patient care.

==Non-health usages==
The term &quot;average length of stay&quot; (ALOS) is also applicable to other industries, e.g. entertainment, event marketing, trade show and leisure. ALOS is used to determine the length of time an attendee is expected to spend on a site or in a venue and is part of the calculation used to determine the gross sales potential for selling space to vendors etc. and affects everything from parking to sanitation, staffing and food and beverage. Almost all operational aspects can be altered by an attendee&#x27;s ALOS.

<text>At Trinity College Dublin and the University of Cambridge, a sizar is an undergraduate who receives some form of assistance such as meals, lower fees or lodging during his or her period of study, in some cases in return for doing a defined job.

==Etymology==
The word is thought to derive from the &quot;sizes&quot; or &quot;sizings&quot; (in turn a shortened form of &quot;assize&quot;), which were the specified portions of food and drink made available at a fixed price at the college. One of the sizar&#x27;s duties was, historically, to fetch the &quot;sizes&quot; for his colleagues.

==History==

=== University of Cambridge ===
At Cambridge, a sizar was originally an undergraduate student who financed his studies by undertaking more or less menial tasks within his college but, as time went on, was increasingly likely to receive small grants from the college. Certain colleges, including St John&#x27;s and Trinity, distinguished between two categories of sizar: there were specific endowments for specific numbers of sizars who were called &quot;proper sizars&quot;; those who were not so endowed, but who were maintained by fellow-commoners and fellows were called subsizars. Isaac Newton matriculated as subsizar at Trinity College.

Richard S. Westfall noted that sizars were considerably more successful in gaining degrees than the gentlemen who entered Cambridge in the seventeenth century. Whereas only 30% of the latter (and 68% of the sons of professionals) continued to the degree, around 80% of the sons of tradesmen and yeomen, who made up most of the sizars, took their degree.

Churchill College, Cambridge offers three sizarships per year, with the recipients being expected to promote music, theatre and the visual arts in the life of the college.

=== Trinity College Dublin ===

According to &quot;Alumni Dublinenses&quot; from 1935, most students entered Trinity College Dublin as &quot;pensioners&quot;; in other words, they paid a fixed sum annually. The other two categories were &quot;sizars&quot; and &quot;fellow commoners&quot; (&quot;Socii Comitates&quot;). Sizars were &quot;allowed free education in consideration of performing certain, at one time menial, duties&quot;; fellow commoners paid double fees and enjoyed several privileges, including that of finishing the college course in three years instead of four; &quot;sizars were sons of poor parents, frequently the clergy&quot;. According to William Howitt, writing in 1847 with reference to Oliver Goldsmith:
Sizarships are still awarded at Dublin, to new entrants of limited means who have shown merit in their school-leaving examinations. They receive their evening meal () free of charge, normally for the first two years of an undergraduate course. The word &quot;sizarship&quot; is also still used elsewhere to refer to monetary awards made to members of a student body willing to take on defined jobs with responsibility; according to John Stillwell, &quot;Sizars had to earn their keep as servants to the wealthier students [...]&quot;.

<doc id="217647" wikidata="Q2165944" url="?curid=217647" title="Self-modifying code">
<text>In computer science, self-modifying code (SMC or SMoC) is code that alters its own instructions while it is executing – usually to reduce the instruction path length and improve performance or simply to reduce otherwise repetitively similar code, thus simplifying maintenance. The term is usually only applied to code where the self-modification is intentional, not in situations where code accidentally modifies itself due to an error such as a buffer overflow.

Self-modifying code can involve overwriting existing instructions or generating new code at run time and transferring control to that code.

Self-modification can be used as an alternative to the method of &quot;flag setting&quot; and conditional program branching, used primarily to reduce the number of times a condition needs to be tested.

The method is frequently used for conditionally invoking test/debugging code without requiring additional computational overhead for every input/output cycle.

The modifications may be performed:
* only during initialization – based on input parameters (when the process is more commonly described as software &#x27;configuration&#x27; and is somewhat analogous, in hardware terms, to setting jumpers for printed circuit boards). Alteration of program entry pointers is an equivalent indirect method of self-modification, but requiring the co-existence of one or more alternative instruction paths, increasing the program size.
* throughout execution (&quot;on the fly&quot;) – based on particular program states that have been reached during the execution

In either case, the modifications may be performed directly to the machine code instructions themselves, by overlaying new instructions over the existing ones (for example: altering a compare and branch to an unconditional branch or alternatively a &#x27;NOP&#x27;).

In the IBM System/360 architecture, and its successors up to z/Architecture, an EXECUTE (EX) instruction &quot;logically&quot; overlays the second byte of its target instruction with the low-order 8 bits of register 1. This provides the effect of self-modification although the actual instruction in storage is not altered.

==Application in low and high level languages==
Self-modification can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending upon the programming language and its support for pointers and/or access to dynamic compiler or interpreter &#x27;engines&#x27;:
* overlay of existing instructions (or parts of instructions such as opcode, register, flags or addresses) or
* direct creation of whole instructions or sequences of instructions in memory
* creating or modification of source code statements followed by a &#x27;mini compile&#x27; or a dynamic interpretation (see eval statement)
* creating an entire program dynamically and then executing it

===Assembly language===
Self-modifying code is quite straightforward to implement when using assembly language. Instructions can be dynamically created in memory (or else overlaid over existing code in non-protected program storage), in a sequence equivalent to the ones that a standard compiler may generate as the object code. With modern processors, there can be unintended side effects on the CPU cache that must be considered. The method was frequently used for testing &#x27;first time&#x27; conditions, as in this suitably commented IBM/360 assembler example. It uses instruction overlay to reduce the instruction path length by (N×1)−1 where N is the number of records on the file (−1 being the overhead to perform the overlay).

 SUBRTN NOP OPENED FIRST TIME HERE?
 * The NOP is x&#x27;4700&#x27;&lt;Address_of_opened&gt;
 OI SUBRTN+1,X&#x27;F0&#x27; YES, CHANGE NOP TO UNCONDITIONAL BRANCH (47F0...)
 OPEN INPUT AND OPEN THE INPUT FILE SINCE IT&#x27;S THE FIRST TIME THRU
 OPENED GET INPUT NORMAL PROCESSING RESUMES HERE

Alternative code might involve testing a &quot;flag&quot; each time through. The unconditional branch is slightly faster than a compare instruction, as well as reducing the overall path length. In later operating systems for programs residing in protected storage this technique could not be used and so changing the pointer to the subroutine would be used instead. The pointer would reside in dynamic storage and could be altered at will after the first pass to bypass the OPEN (having to load a pointer first instead of a direct branch &amp; link to the subroutine would add N instructions to the path length – but there would be a corresponding reduction of N for the unconditional branch that would no longer be required).

Below is an example in Zilog Z80 assembly language. The code increments register &quot;B&quot; in range [0,5]. The &quot;CP&quot; compare instruction is modified on each loop.
ORG 0H
CALL FUNC00
HALT
FUNC00:
LD A,6
LD HL,label01+1
LD B,(HL)
label00:
INC B
LD (HL),B
label01:
CP $0
JP NZ,label00
RET

Self-modifying code is sometimes used to overcome limitations in a machine&#x27;s instruction set. For example, in the Intel 8080 instruction set, one cannot input a byte from an input port that is specified in a register. The input port is statically encoded in the instruction itself, as the second byte of a two byte instruction. Using self-modifying code, it is possible to store a register&#x27;s contents into the second byte of the instruction, then execute the modified instruction in order to achieve the desired effect.

===High-level languages===
Some compiled languages explicitly permit self-modifying code. For example, the ALTER verb in COBOL may be implemented as a branch instruction that is modified during execution. Some batch programming techniques involve the use of self-modifying code. Clipper and SPITBOL also provide facilities for explicit self-modification. The Algol compiler on B6700 systems offered an interface to the operating system whereby executing code could pass a text string or a named disc file to the Algol compiler and was then able to invoke the new version of a procedure.

With interpreted languages, the &quot;machine code&quot; is the source text and may be susceptible to editing on-the-fly: in SNOBOL the source statements being executed are elements of a text array. Other languages, such as Perl and Python, allow programs to create new code at run-time and execute it using an eval function, but do not allow existing code to be mutated. The illusion of modification (even though no machine code is really being overwritten) is achieved by modifying function pointers, as in this JavaScript example:

 var f = function (x) {return x + 1};

 // assign a new definition to f:
 f = new Function(&#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;return x + 2&#x27;);

Lisp macros also allow runtime code generation without parsing a string containing program code.

The Push programming language is a genetic programming system that is explicitly designed for creating self-modifying programs. While not a high level language, it is not as low level as assembly language.

====Compound modification====
Prior to the advent of multiple windows, command-line systems might offer a menu system involving the modification of a running command script. Suppose a DOS script (or &quot;batch&quot;) file MENU.BAT contains the following: 
 :start
 SHOWMENU.EXE
Upon initiation of MENU.BAT from the command line, SHOWMENU presents an on-screen menu, with possible help information, example usages and so forth. Eventually the user makes a selection that requires a command &quot;SOMENAME&quot; to be performed: SHOWMENU exits after rewriting the file MENU.BAT to contain
 :start
 SHOWMENU.EXE
 CALL &quot;SOMENAME&quot;.BAT
 GOTO start
Because the DOS command interpreter does not compile a script file and then execute it, nor does it read the entire file into memory before starting execution, nor yet rely on the content of a record buffer, when SHOWMENU exits, the command interpreter finds a new command to execute (it is to invoke the script file &quot;SOMENAME&quot;, in a directory location and via a protocol known to SHOWMENU), and after that command completes, it goes back to the start of the script file and reactivates SHOWMENU ready for the next selection. Should the menu choice be to quit, the file would be rewritten back to its original state. Although this starting state has no use for the label, it, or an equivalent amount of text is required, because the DOS command interpreter recalls the byte position of the next command when it is to start the next command, thus the re-written file must maintain alignment for the next command start point to indeed be the start of the next command.

Aside from the convenience of a menu system (and possible auxiliary features), this scheme means that the SHOWMENU.EXE system is not in memory when the selected command is activated, a significant advantage when memory is limited.

===Control tables===
Control table interpreters can be considered to be, in one sense, &#x27;self-modified&#x27; by data values extracted from the table entries (rather than specifically hand coded in conditional statements of the form &quot;IF inputx = &#x27;yyy&#x27;&quot;).

===Channel programs===
Some IBM access methods traditionally used self-modifying channel programs, where a value, such as a disk address, is read into an area referenced by a channel program, where it is used by a later channel command to access the disk.

==History==
The IBM SSEC, demonstrated in January 1948, had the ability to modify its instructions or otherwise treat them exactly like data. However, the capability was rarely used in practice. In the early days of computers, self-modifying code was often used to reduce use of limited memory, or improve performance, or both. It was also sometimes used to implement subroutine calls and returns when the instruction set only provided simple branching or skipping instructions to vary the control flow. This use is still relevant in certain ultra-RISC architectures, at least theoretically; see for example one-instruction set computer. Donald Knuth&#x27;s MIX architecture also used self-modifying code to implement subroutine calls.

==Usage==
Self-modifying code can be used for various purposes:

* Semi-automatic optimizing of a state-dependent loop.
* Dynamic in-place code optimization for speed depending on load environment.
* Run-time code generation, or specialization of an algorithm in runtime or loadtime (which is popular, for example, in the domain of real-time graphics) such as a general sort utility – preparing code to perform the key comparison described in a specific invocation.
* Altering of inlined state of an object, or simulating the high-level construction of closures.
* Patching of subroutine (pointer) address calling, usually as performed at load/initialization time of dynamic libraries, or else on each invocation, patching the subroutine&#x27;s internal references to its parameters so as to use their actual addresses (i.e. indirect self-modification).
* Evolutionary computing systems such as neuroevolution, genetic programming and other evolutionary algorithms.
* Hiding of code to prevent reverse engineering (by use of a disassembler or debugger) or to evade detection by virus/spyware scanning software and the like.
* Filling 100% of memory (in some architectures) with a rolling pattern of repeating opcodes, to erase all programs and data, or to burn-in hardware or perform RAM tests.
* Compressing code to be decompressed and executed at runtime, e.g., when memory or disk space is limited.
* Some very limited instruction sets leave no option but to use self-modifying code to perform certain functions. For example, a one-instruction set computer (OISC) machine that uses only the subtract-and-branch-if-negative &quot;instruction&quot; cannot do an indirect copy (something like the equivalent of &quot;*a = **b&quot; in the C language) without using self-modifying code.
* Booting. Early microcomputers often used self-modifying code in their bootloaders. Since the bootloader was keyed in via the front panel at every power-on, it did not matter if the bootloader modified itself. However, even today many bootstrap loaders are self-relocating, and a few are even self-modifying.
* Altering instructions for fault-tolerance.

===Optimizing a state-dependent loop===
Pseudocode example:

 repeat &quot;N&quot; times {
 if STATE is 1
 increase A by one
 else
 decrease A by one
 do something with A

Self-modifying code, in this case, would simply be a matter of rewriting the loop like this:

 repeat &quot;N&quot; times {
 &quot;increase&quot; A by one
 do something with A
 when STATE has to switch {
 replace the opcode &quot;increase&quot; above with the opcode to decrease, or vice versa
 }

Note that two-state replacement of the opcode can be easily written as &#x27;xor var at address with the value &quot;opcodeOf(Inc) xor opcodeOf(dec)&quot;&#x27;.

Choosing this solution must depend on the value of and the frequency of state changing.

===Specialization===
Suppose a set of statistics such as average, extrema, location of extrema, standard deviation, etc. are to be calculated for some large data set. In a general situation, there may be an option of associating weights with the data, so each xi is associated with a wi and rather than test for the presence of weights at every index value, there could be two versions of the calculation, one for use with weights and one not, with one test at the start. Now consider a further option, that each value may have associated with it a Boolean to signify whether that value is to be skipped or not. This could be handled by producing four batches of code, one for each permutation and code bloat results. Alternatively, the weight and the skip arrays could be merged into a temporary array (with zero weights for values to be skipped), at the cost of processing and still there is bloat. However, with code modification, to the template for calculating the statistics could be added as appropriate the code for skipping unwanted values, and for applying weights. There would be no repeated testing of the options and the data array would be accessed once, as also would the weight and skip arrays, if involved.

===Use as camouflage===
Self-modifying code is more complex to analyze than standard code and can therefore be used as a protection against reverse engineering and software cracking. Self-modifying code was used to hide copy protection instructions in 1980s disk-based programs for systems such as IBM PC compatibles and Apple II. For example, on an IBM PC, the floppy disk drive access instruction codice_1 would not appear in the executable program&#x27;s image but it would be written into the executable&#x27;s memory image after the program started executing.

Self-modifying code is also sometimes used by programs that do not want to reveal their presence, such as computer viruses and some shellcodes. Viruses and shellcodes that use self-modifying code mostly do this in combination with polymorphic code. Modifying a piece of running code is also used in certain attacks, such as buffer overflows.

===Self-referential machine learning systems===
Traditional machine learning systems have a fixed, pre-programmed learning algorithm to adjust their parameters. However, since the 1980s Jürgen Schmidhuber has published several self-modifying systems with the ability to change their own learning algorithm. They avoid the danger of catastrophic self-rewrites by making sure that self-modifications will survive only if they are useful according to a user-given fitness, error or reward function.

===Operating systems===
The Linux kernel notably makes wide use of self-modifying code; it does so to be able to distribute a single binary image for each major architecture (e.g. IA-32, x86-64, 32-bit ARM, ARM64...) while adapting the kernel code in memory during boot depending on the specific CPU model detected, e.g. to be able to take advantage of new CPU instructions or to work around hardware bugs. To a lesser extent, the DR-DOS kernel also optimizes speed-critical sections of itself at loadtime depending on the underlying processor generation.

Regardless, at a meta-level, programs can still modify their own behavior by changing data stored elsewhere (see metaprogramming) or via use of polymorphism.

===Massalin&#x27;s Synthesis kernel===
The Synthesis kernel presented in Alexia Massalin&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis is a tiny Unix kernel that takes a structured, or even object oriented, approach to self-modifying code, where code is created for individual quajects, like filehandles. Generating code for specific tasks allows the Synthesis kernel to (as a JIT interpreter might) apply a number of optimizations such as constant folding or common subexpression elimination.

The Synthesis kernel was very fast, but was written entirely in assembly. The resulting lack of portability has prevented Massalin&#x27;s optimization ideas from being adopted by any production kernel. However, the structure of the techniques suggests that they could be captured by a higher level language, albeit one more complex than existing mid-level languages. Such a language and compiler could allow development of faster operating systems and applications.

Paul Haeberli and Bruce Karsh have objected to the &quot;marginalization&quot; of self-modifying code, and optimization in general, in favor of reduced development costs.

==Interaction of cache and self-modifying code==
On architectures without coupled data and instruction cache (for example, some SPARC, ARM, and MIPS cores) the cache synchronization must be explicitly performed by the modifying code (flush data cache and invalidate instruction cache for the modified memory area).

In some cases short sections of self-modifying code execute more slowly on modern processors. This is because a modern processor will usually try to keep blocks of code in its cache memory. Each time the program rewrites a part of itself, the rewritten part must be loaded into the cache again, which results in a slight delay, if the modified codelet shares the same cache line with the modifying code, as is the case when the modified memory address is located within a few bytes to the one of the modifying code.

The cache invalidation issue on modern processors usually means that self-modifying code would still be faster only when the modification will occur rarely, such as in the case of a state switching inside an inner loop.

Most modern processors load the machine code before they execute it, which means that if an instruction that is too near the instruction pointer is modified, the processor will not notice, but instead execute the code as it was &quot;before&quot; it was modified. See prefetch input queue (PIQ). PC processors must handle self-modifying code correctly for backwards compatibility reasons but they are far from efficient at doing so.

==Security issues==
Because of the security implications of self-modifying code, all of the major operating systems are careful to remove such vulnerabilities as they become known. The concern is typically not that programs will intentionally modify themselves, but that they could be maliciously changed by an exploit.

One mechanism for preventing malicious code modification is an operating system feature called W^X (for &quot;write xor execute&quot;). This mechanism prohibits a program from making any page of memory both writable and executable. Some systems prevent a writable page from ever being changed to be executable, even if write permission is removed. Other systems provide a &#x27;back door&#x27; of sorts, allowing multiple mappings of a page of memory to have different permissions. A relatively portable way to bypass W^X is to create a file with all permissions, then map the file into memory twice. On Linux, one may use an undocumented SysV shared memory flag to get executable shared memory without needing to create a file.

==Advantages==
* Fast paths can be established for a program&#x27;s execution, reducing some otherwise repetitive conditional branches.
* Self-modifying code can improve algorithmic efficiency.

==Disadvantages==
Self-modifying code is harder to read and maintain because the instructions in the source program listing are not necessarily the instructions that will be executed. Self-modification that consists of substitution of function pointers might not be as cryptic, if it is clear that the names of functions to be called are placeholders for functions to be identified later.

Self-modifying code can be rewritten as code that tests a flag and branches to alternative sequences based on the outcome of the test, but self-modifying code typically runs faster.

Self-modifying code conflicts with authentication of the code and may require exceptions to policies requiring that all code running on a system be signed.

Modified code must be stored separately from its original form, conflicting with memory management solutions that normally discard the code in RAM and reload it from the executable file as needed.

On modern processors with an instruction pipeline, code that modifies itself frequently may run more slowly, if it modifies instructions that the processor has already read from memory into the pipeline. On some such processors, the only way to ensure that the modified instructions are executed correctly is to flush the pipeline and reread many instructions.

Self-modifying code cannot be used at all in some environments, such as the following:
* Application software running under an operating system with strict W^X security cannot execute instructions in pages it is allowed to write to—only the operating system is allowed to both write instructions to memory and later execute those instructions.
* Many Harvard architecture microcontrollers cannot execute instructions in read-write memory, but only instructions in memory that it cannot write to, ROM or non-self-programmable flash memory.
* A multithreaded application may have several threads executing the same section of self-modifying code, possibly resulting in computation errors and application failures.

<text>The bamboo curtain was a political demarcation between the communist states of East Asia, particularly the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the capitalist states of East, South and Southeast Asia. To the north and northwest lay the communist states of: China, Russia (the Soviet Union before A.D. 1991), North Vietnam, North Korea and the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. To the south and east lay the capitalist countries of India, Pakistan, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau.
Before the Indochina Wars, the non-communist bloc included French Indochina and its successor states: South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, after the wars, the new countries of Vietnam, Laos, and Democratic Kampuchea became communist states. In particular, following the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone became an important symbol of this Asian division (though the term &quot;bamboo curtain&quot; itself is rarely used in that specific context).

== Cold War (1947 – 1991) ==
The colorful term &quot;bamboo curtain&quot; was derived from &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, a term used widely in Europe from the mid 1940s to the late 1980s to refer to that region&#x27;s communist boundaries. It was used less often than &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; in part because while the latter remained relatively static for over 40 years, the &quot;bamboo curtain&quot; shifted frequently and was somewhat less precise. The &quot;bamboo curtain&quot; was also located mostly in regions where terrain made the extensive border fortifications that characterized the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; impractical. It was also a less accurate description of the political situation in Asia because of the lack of cohesion within the East Asian communist bloc, which resulted in the Sino-Soviet split. During the First Cold War, communist governments in Mongolia, Vietnam, and Laos were allies of the Soviet Union, though they sometimes cooperated with China, while Pol Pot&#x27;s Cambodian regime was loyal to China. After the Korean War, North Korea avoided taking sides between the Soviets and China. (Since the end of a communist bloc in Asia, North Korea remains on good terms with both Russia and China, although relations between the countries have been strained in modern times.)

During the Cultural Revolution in China, the Chinese authorities put sections of the &quot;curtain&quot; under a lock-down of sorts, forbidding entry into or passage out of the country without permission from the Chinese government. Many would-be refugees attempting to flee to capitalist countries were prevented from escaping. Occasional relaxations led to several waves of refugees into the British crown colony of Hong Kong.

Improved relations between China and the United States during the later years of the Cold War rendered the term more or less obsolete, except when it referred to the Korean Peninsula and the divide between allies of the US and allies of the USSR in Southeast Asia. Even today, the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea is typically described as the DMZ. Until recently, &quot;bamboo curtain&quot; was used most often to refer to the enclosed borders and economy of Burma (though this began to open in 2010). The bamboo curtain has since given way to the business model called the &quot;bamboo network&quot;.

<text>Vanda, abbreviated in the horticultural trade as &quot;V.,&quot; is a genus in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. There are 90 species, and the genus is commonly cultivated for the marketplace. This genus and its allies are considered to be among the most specifically adapted of all orchids within the Orchidaceae. The genus is highly prized in horticulture for its showy, fragrant, long-lasting, and intensely colorful flowers. &quot;Vanda&quot; species are widespread across East Asia, Southeast Asia, and New Guinea, with a few species extending into Queensland and some of the islands of the western Pacific.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Vanda&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit (वन्दाका) name for the species &quot;Vanda roxburghii&quot; (a synonym of &quot;Vanda tessellata&quot;).

==Distribution==
These mostly epiphytic, but sometimes lithophytic or terrestrial orchids, are distributed in India, Himalaya, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, southern China, and northern Australia.

==Description==
The genus has a monopodial growth habit with flat, typically broad, ovoid leaves (strap-leaves). Species with cylindrical (terete), fleshy leaves, which are adapted to dry periods were transferred to the genus Papilionanthe. The stems of these orchids vary considerably in size; some are miniature plants and some have a length of several meters. The plants can become quite massive in habitat and in cultivation, and epiphytic species possess very large, rambling aerial root systems. The roots have pneumatodes.

The few to many flattened flowers grow on a lateral inflorescence. Most show a yellow-brown color with brown markings, but they also appear in white, green, orange, red, and burgundy shades. The lip has a small spur. &quot;Vanda&quot; species usually bloom every few months and the flowers last for two to three weeks.

==Ecology==
===Pollination===
&quot;Vanda falcata&quot; has been reported to be pollinated by several hawkmoth species of the genus &quot;Theretra&quot;, namely &quot;Theretra japonica&quot; and &quot;Theretra nessus&quot;.

==Conservation==
Many &quot;Vanda&quot; orchids (especially &quot;V. coerulea&quot;) are endangered, and have never been common because they are usually only infrequently encountered in habitat and grow only in disturbed forest areas with high light levels, and are severely threatened and vulnerable to habitat destruction. The export of wild-collected specimens of the blue orchid (&quot;V. coerulea&quot;) and other wild &quot;Vanda&quot; species is prohibited worldwide, as all orchids are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

== Cultivation ==
This genus is one of the five most horticulturally important orchid genera, because it has some of the most magnificent flowers to be found in the orchid family. This has contributed much to the work of hybridists producing flowers for the cut flower market. &quot;V. coerulea&quot; is one of the few botanical orchids which can produce varieties with blue flowers (actually a very bluish purple), a property much appreciated for producing interspecific and intergeneric hybrids.

The color blue is rare among orchids, and only certain species of &quot;Thelymitra&quot;, a terrestrial species from Australia, produces flowers that are truly &quot;blue&quot; among the orchids. These species, much like &quot;Vanda&quot;, also have a bluish-purple tint towards the inner petals of the flowers.

&quot;Vanda dearei&quot; is one of the chief sources of yellow color in &quot;Vanda&quot; hybrids.

The plants do not possess pseudobulbs, but do possess leathery, drought-resistant leaves. Almost all of the species in this genus are very large epiphytes found in disturbed areas in habitat and prefer very high light levels, the plants having large root systems. Some of these species have a monopodial vine-like growth habit, and the plants can quickly become quite massive.

These plants prefer consistent conditions day-to-day in cultivation to avoid dropping their bottom leaves. The epiphytic species are best accommodated in large wooden baskets, bare rooted, which allows for the large aerial root systems. Disturbing or damaging the roots of large, mature vandaceous orchid plants, and in particular, &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Aerides&quot; species, can result in the plants failing to flower and going into decline for a season or more. These plants do not tolerate disturbance or damage of their root systems in cultivation when they become mature. The terete-leaved terrestrial species are very easy to cultivate.

When grown bare-rooted, the epiphytic species require daily watering and weekly feeding and are very heavy feeders in cultivation. They can be grown out-of-doors in Hawaii and the like provided they are given some shade.

===Fungal infections===

Unfortunately fungal infections are not uncommon in cultivated plants. A variety of phytopathogens may infect &quot;Vanda&quot; orchids. Vandas may be affected by &quot;Fusarium&quot; wilt. This disease is characterized by purple discolouration in the vascular tissue, which results in the loss of their function. The hyphae and spores block the conductor vessels. Affected plants may superficially appear healthy, as they continue to grow, the oldest parts of the plants can be affected and the disease will eventually progress throughout the entire plant. If cutting tools are not sterilized the infection may spread to other plants.

== Systematics ==
In a recent molecular study of the genus &quot;Vanda&quot; , several Genera including the former Genus &quot;Ascocentrum&quot;, &quot;Neofinetia&quot; and &quot;Euanthe&quot; were brought into synonym with &quot;Vanda&quot;.

<text>Music therapy, an allied health profession, &quot;is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.&quot; It is also a vocation, involving a deep commitment to music and the desire to use it as a medium to help others. Although music therapy has only been established as a profession relatively recently, the connection between music and therapy is not new.

Music therapy is a broad field. Music therapists use music-based experiences to address client needs in one or more domains of human functioning: cognitive, academic, emotional/psychological; behavioral; communication; social; physiological (sensory, motor, pain, neurological and other physical systems), spiritual, aesthetics. Music experiences are strategically designed to use the elements of music for therapeutic effects, including melody, harmony, key, mode, meter, rhythm, pitch/range, duration, timbre, form, texture, and instrumentation.

Some common music therapy practices include developmental work (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs, songwriting and listening in reminiscence, orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic entrainment for physical rehabilitation in stroke survivors. Music therapy is used in medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, and correctional facilities.

Music therapy is distinctive from musopathy, which relies on a more generic and non-cultural approach based on neural, physical, and other responses to the fundamental aspects of sound.

Music therapy might also be described as Sound Healing. Extensive studies have been made with this description.

Music therapy aims to provide physical and mental benefit. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Studies on people diagnosed with mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have associated some improvements in mental health after music therapy. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have claimed that music therapy is an effective method in helping people experiencing mental health issues, and more should be done to offer those in need this type of help.

== Uses ==

=== Children and adolescents ===
Music therapy may be suggested for adolescent populations to help manage disorders usually diagnosed in adolescence, such as mood/anxiety disorders and eating disorders, or inappropriate behaviors, including suicide attempts, withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers, aggression, running away, and substance abuse. Goals in treating adolescents with music therapy, especially for those at high risk, often include increased recognition and awareness of emotions and moods, improved decision-making skills, opportunities for creative self expression, decreased anxiety, increased self-confidence, improved self-esteem, and better listening skills.

There is some evidence that, when combined with other types of rehabilitation, music therapy may contribute to the success rate of sensorimotor, cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation. For children and adolescents with major depressive or anxiety disorders, there is moderate to low quality evidence that music therapy added to the standard treatment may reduce internalizing symptoms and may be more effective than treatment as usual (without music therapy).

==== Methods ====
Among adolescents, group meetings and individual sessions are the main methods for music therapy. Both methods may include listening to music, discussing concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, analyzing the meanings of specific songs, writing lyrics, composing or performing music, and musical improvisation.

Private individual sessions can provide personal attention and are most effective when using music preferred by the patient. Using music that adolescents can relate to or connect with can help adolescent patients view the therapist as safe and trustworthy, and to engage in therapy with less resistance. Music therapy conducted in groups allows adolescent individuals to feel a sense of belonging, express their opinions, learn how to socialize and verbalize appropriately with peers, improve compromising skills, and develop tolerance and empathy. Group sessions that emphasize cooperation and cohesion can be effective in working with adolescents.

Music therapy intervention programs typically include about 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child&#x27;s existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, the condition of the client, and the environmental resources available. Both techniques use systematic processes where the therapists assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.

==== Assessment ====
Assessment includes obtaining a full medical history, current non-musical functioning (social, physical/motor, emotional, etc.) and goals, musical (ability to duplicate a melody or identify changes in rhythm, etc.) and a determination of the potential for music therapy to be effective in addressing goals.

=== Premature infants ===
Premature infants are those born at 37 weeks after conception or earlier. They are subject to numerous health risks, such as abnormal breathing patterns, decreased body fat and muscle tissue, as well as feeding issues. The coordination for sucking and breathing is often not fully developed, making feeding a challenge. Offering musical therapy to premature infants while they are in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) aims to both mask unwanted auditory stimuli, stimulate infant development, and promote a calm environment for families. While there are no reported adverse effects from music therapy, the evidence supporting music therapy&#x27;s beneficial effects for infants is weak as many of the clinical trials that have been performed either had mixed results or were poorly designed. There is no strong evidence to suggest that music therapy improves an infant&#x27;s oxygen therapy, improves sucking, or improves development when compared to usual care. There is some weaker evidence that music therapy may decrease an infants&#x27; heart rate. There is no evidence to indicate that music therapy reduces anxiety in parents of preterm infants in the NICU or information to understand what type of music therapy may be more beneficial or how for how long.

=== Medical disorders ===
Music may both motivate and provide a sense of distraction. Rhythmic stimuli has been found to help balance training for those with a brain injury.

Singing is a form of rehabilitation for neurological impairments. Neurological impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of apraxia – loss to perform purposeful movements, dysarthria, muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central nervous system), aphasia (defect in expression causing distorted speech), or language comprehension. It is shown that patients with schizophrenia have altered feeling on major and minor chord. Singing training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For example, melodic intonation therapy is the practice of communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or increase speech production by promoting socialization, and emotional expression.

==== Autism ====
Music may help people with autism hone their motor and attention skills as well as healthy neurodevelopment of socio-communication and interaction skills. Music therapy may also contribute to improved selective attention, speech production, and language processing and acquisition in people with autism.

Music therapy may benefit the family as a whole. Some family members of children with autism claim that music therapy sessions have allowed their child to interact more with the family and the world. Music therapy is also beneficial in that it gives children an outlet to use outside of the sessions. Some children after participating in music therapy may want to keep making music long after the sessions end.

==== Heart disease ====
Listening to music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in those with coronary heart disease (CHD). 

==== Stroke ====
Music may be a useful tool in the recovery of motor skills.

==== Dementia ====


Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects of the disorder can be seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. A study of over 330 subjects showed that music therapy produces highly significant improvements in social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient and the quality and length of treatment.

A group of adults with dementia participated in group music therapy. In the group, these adults engaged in singing, drumming, improvisation, and movement. Each of these activities engaged the adults in different ways. The singing aided with memory, as these adults improved memorization skills in by taking out specific words in the chorus of a song and by repeating phrases back to the music therapist when the therapist sang a phrase of a song to them. Drumming led to increased socialization of the group, as it allowed the patients collaborate to create particular rhythms. Improvisation allowed the patients to get out of their comfort zone and taught them how to better deal with anxiety. Lastly, movement with either one arm or two increased social interaction between the patients.

Another meta-study examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy&#x27;s effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect on the patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves as a sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.

==== Aphasia ====
Broca&#x27;s aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a language disorder caused by damage to Broca&#x27;s area and surrounding regions in the left frontal lobe. Those with non-fluent aphasia are able to understand language fairly well, but they struggle with language production and syntax.

Neurologist Oliver Sacks studied neurological oddities in people, trying to understand how the brain works. He concluded that people with some type of frontal lobe damage often &quot;produced not only severe difficulties with expressive language (aphasia) but a strange access of musicality with incessant whistling, singing and a passionate interest in music. For him, this was an example of normally suppressed brain functions being released by damage to others&quot;. Sacks had a genuine interest in trying to help people affected with neurological disorders and other phenomena associated with music, and how it can provide access to otherwise unreachable emotional states, revivify neurological avenues that have been frozen, evoke memories of earlier, lost events or states of being and attempts to bring those with neurological disorders back to a time when the world was much richer for them. He was a firm believer that music has the power to heal.

Melodic intonation therapy (MIT), developed in 1973 by neurological researchers Sparks, Helm and Albert, is a method used by music therapists and speech–language pathologists to help people with communication disorders caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain by engaging the singing abilities and possibly engaging language-capable regions in the undamaged right hemisphere.

While unable to speak fluently, patients with non-fluent aphasia are often able to sing words, phrases, and even sentences they cannot express otherwise. MIT harnesses the singing ability of patients with non-fluent aphasia as a means to improve their communication. Although its exact nature depends on the therapist, in general MIT relies on the use of intonation (the rising and falling of the voice) and rhythm (beat/speed) to train patients to produce phrases verbally. In MIT, common words and phrases are turned into melodic phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song patterns and eventually emulating typical speech intonation and rhythmic patterns. A therapist will usually begin by introducing an intonation to their patient through humming. They will accompany this humming with a rhythm produced by the tapping of the left hand. At the same time, the therapist will introduce a visual stimuli of the written phrase to be learned. The therapist then sings the phrase with the patient, and ideally the patient is eventually able to sing the phrase on their own. With much repetition and through a process of &quot;inner-rehearsal&quot; (practicing internally hearing one&#x27;s voice singing), a patient may eventually be able to produce the phrase verbally without singing. As the patient advances in therapy, the procedure can be adapted to give them more autonomy and to teach them more complex phrases. Through the use of MIT, a non-fluent aphasic patient can be taught numerous phrases which aid them to communicate and function during daily life.

The mechanisms of this success are yet to be fully understood. It is commonly agreed that while speech is lateralized mostly to the left hemisphere (for right-handed and most left-handed individuals), some speech functionality is also distributed in the right hemisphere. MIT is thought to stimulate these right language areas through the activation of music processing areas also in the right hemisphere Similarly, the rhythmic tapping of the left hand stimulates the right sensorimotor cortex to further engage the right hemisphere in language production. Overall, by stimulating the right hemisphere during language tasks, therapists hope to decrease dependence on the left hemisphere for language production.

While results are somewhat contradictory, studies have in fact found increased right hemispheric activation in non-fluent aphasic patients after MIT. This change in activation has been interpreted as evidence of decreased dependence on the left hemisphere. There is debate, however, as to whether changes in right hemispheric activation are part of the therapeutic process during/after MIT, or are simply a side effect of non-fluent aphasia. In hopes of making MIT more effective, researchers are continually studying the mechanisms of MIT and non-fluent aphasia.

==== Cancer ====
There is tentative evidence that music interventions led by a trained music therapist may have positive effects on psychological and physical outcomes in adults with cancer. The effectiveness of music therapy for children with cancer is not known.

=== Mental health ===
There is weak evidence to suggest that people with schizophrenia may benefit from the addition of music therapy along with their other standard treatment regieme. Potential improvements include decreased aggression, fewer hallucinations and delusions, social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. In addition, moderate-to-low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms). Further research using standardized music therapy programs and consistent monitoring protocols are necessary to understand the effectiveness of this approach for adults with schizophrenia. Music therapy may be a useful tool for helping treat people with post-traumatic stress disorder however more rigorous empirical study is required.

For adults with depressive symptoms, there is some weak evidence to suggest that music therapy may help reduce symptoms and recreative music therapy and guided imagery and music being superior to other methods in reducing depressive symptoms.

In the use of music therapy for adults, there is &quot;music medicine&quot; which is called for listening to prerecorded music as treated like a medicine. Music Therapy also uses &quot;Receptive music therapy&quot; using &quot;music-assisted relaxation&quot; and using images connecting to the music.

There is some discussion on the process of change facilitated by musical activities on mental wellness. Scholars proposed a six-dimensional framework, which contains emotional, psychological, social, cognitive, behavioral and spiritual aspects. Through conducting interview sessions with mental health service users (with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders), their study showed the relevance of the six-dimensional framework.

==== Impact on general mental health ====
Music therapy has been used to help bring improvements to mental health among people of all age groups. It has been used as far back as the 1830s. One example of a mental hospital that used music therapy to aid in the healing process of their patients includes the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum. This mental hospital provided &quot;music and movement sessions and musical performances&quot; as well as &quot;group and individual music therapy for patients with serious mental illness or emotional problems.&quot; Two main categories of music therapy were used in this study; analytic music therapy and Nordoff-Robbins music therapy. Analytic music therapy involves both words and music, while Nordoff-Robbins music therapy places great emphasis on assessing how clients react to music therapy and how the use of this type of therapy can be constantly altered and shifted to allow it to benefit the client the most.

=== Bereavement ===
The DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) lists bereavement as a mental health diagnosis when the focus of clinical attention is related to the loss of a loved one and when symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder are present for up to two months. Music therapy models have been found to be successful in treating grief and bereavement (Rosner, Kruse &amp; Hagl, 2010).In many countries, including the United States, music therapists do not diagnose, therefore diagnosing a bereavement-related disorder would not be within their scope of practice.

==== Grief treatment for adolescents ====
Grief treatment is very valuable within the adolescent age group. Just as adults and the elderly struggle with grief from loss, relationship issues, job-related stress, and financial issues, so do adolescents also experience grief from disappointments that occur early on in life, however different these disappointing life events may be. For example, many people of adolescent age experience life-altering events such as parental divorce, trauma from emotional or physical abuse, struggles within school, and loss. If this grief is not acted upon early on through the use of some kind of therapy, it can alter the entire course of an adolescent&#x27;s life. In one particular study on the impact of music therapy on grief management within adolescents used songwriting to allow these adolescents to express what they were feeling through lyrics and instrumentals. In the article &quot;Development of the Grief Process Scale through music therapy songwriting with bereaved adolescents,&quot; the results of the study demonstrate that in all of the treatment groups combined, the mean GPS (grief process scale) score decreased by 43%. The use of music therapy songwriting allowed these adolescents to become less overwhelmed with grief and better able to process it as demonstrated by the decrease in mean GPS score.

=== Empirical evidence ===
Since 2017, providing evidence-based practice is becoming more and more important and music therapy has been continuously critiqued and regulated to provide that desired evidence-based practice. A number of research studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on, or included, music therapy and all have found that music therapy has at least some promising effects, especially when used for the treatment of grief and bereavement. The AMTA has largely supported the advancement of music therapy through research that would promote evidenced-based practice. With the definition of evidence-based health care as &quot;the conscientious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients or the delivery of health services, current best evidence is up-to-date information from relevant, valid research about the effects of different forms of health care, the potential for harm from exposure to particular agents, the accuracy of diagnostic tests, and the predictive power of prognostic factors&quot;.

Both qualitative and quantitative studies have been completed and both have provided evidence to support music therapy in the use of bereavement treatment. One study that evaluated a number of treatment approaches found that only music therapy had significant positive outcomes where the others showed little improvement in participants (Rosner, Kruse &amp; Hagl, 2010). Furthermore, a pilot study, which consisted of an experimental and control group, examined the effects of music therapy on mood and behaviors in the home and school communities. It was found that there was a significant change in grief symptoms and behaviors with the experimental group in the home, but conversely found that there was no significant change in the experimental group in the school community, despite the fact that mean scores on the Depression Self-Rating Index and the Behavior Rating Index decreased (Hilliard, 2001). Yet another study completed by Russel Hilliard (2007), looked at the effects of Orff-based music therapy and social work groups on childhood grief symptoms and behaviors. Using a control group that consisted of wait-listed clients, and employing the Behavior Rating Index for Children and the bereavement Group Questionnaire for Parents and Guardians as measurement tools, it was found that children who were in the music therapy group showed significant improvement in grief symptoms and also showed some improvement in behaviors compared to the control group, whereas the social work group also showed significant improvement in both grief and behaviors compared to the control group. The study concludes with support for music therapy as a medium from bereavement groups for children (Hilliard, 2007).

Though there has been research done on music therapy, and though the use of it has been evaluated, there remain a number of limitations in these studies and further research should be completed before absolute conclusions are made, though the results of using music therapy in the treatment have consistently shown to be positive.

Music therapy practice is working together with clients, through music, to promote healthy change (Bruscia, 1998). The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) has defined the practice of music therapy as &quot;a behavioral science concerned with changing unhealthy behaviors and replacing them with more adaptive ones through the use of musical stimuli&quot;.

=== Interventions ===
Though music therapy practice employs a large number of intervention techniques, some of the most commonly used interventions include improvisation, therapeutic singing, therapeutic instrumental music playing, music-facilitated reminiscence and life review, songwriting, music-facilitated relaxation, and lyric analysis. While there has been no conclusive research done on the comparison of interventions (Jones, 2005; Silverman, 2008; Silverman &amp; Marcionetti, 2004), the use of particular interventions is individualized to each client based upon thorough assessment of needs, and the effectiveness of treatment may not rely on the type of intervention (Silverman, 2009).

Improvisation in music therapy allows for clients to make up, or alter, music as they see fit. While improvisation is an intervention in a methodical practice, it does allow for some freedom of expression, which is what it is often used for. Improvisation has several other clinical goals as well, which can also be found on the Improvisation in music therapy page, such as: facilitating verbal and nonverbal communication, self-exploration, creating intimacy, teamwork, developing creativity, and improving cognitive skills. Building on these goals, Botello and Krout designed a cognitive behavioral application to assess and improve communication in couples. Further research is needed before the use of improvisation is conclusively proven to be effective in this application, but there were positive signs in this study of its use.

Singing or playing an instrument is often used to help clients express their thoughts and feelings in a more structured manner than improvisation and can also allow participation with only limited knowledge of music. Singing in a group can facilitate a sense of community and can also be used as group ritual to structure a theme of the group or of treatment (Krout, 2005).

Research that compares types of music therapy intervention has been inconclusive. Music Therapists use lyric analysis in a variety of ways, but typically lyric analysis is used to facilitate dialogue with clients based on the lyrics, which can then lead to discussion that addresses the goals of therapy.

==Types of music therapy==
Two fundamental types of music therapy are receptive music therapy and active music therapy (also known as expressive music therapy). Active music therapy engages clients or patients in the act of making music, whereas receptive music therapy guides patients or clients in listening or responding to live or recorded music. Either or both can lead to verbal discussions, depending on client needs and the therapist&#x27;s orientation.

=== Receptive ===
Receptive music therapy involves listening to recorded or live genres of music such as classical, rock, jazz, and/or country music. In Receptive music therapy, patients are the recipient of the music experience, meaning that they are actively listening and responding to the music rather than creating it. During music sessions, patients participate in song discussion, music relaxation, and are given the ability to listen to their preferred music genre. It can improve mood, decrease stress, decrease pain, enhance relaxation, and decrease anxiety; this can help with coping skills. There is also evidence 
of biochemical changes (e.g., lowered cortisol levels).

=== Active ===
In active music therapy, patients engage in some form of music-making (e.g., vocalizing, rapping, chanting, singing, playing instruments, improvising, song writing, composing, or conducting). Researchers at Baylor, Scott, and White Universities are studying the effect of harmonica playing on patients with COPD to determine if it helps improve lung function. Another example of active music therapy takes place in a nursing home in Japan: therapists teach the elderly how to play easy-to-use instruments so they can overcome physical difficulties.

== Models and approaches ==
Music therapist Kenneth Bruscia stated: &quot;A &quot;model&quot; is a comprehensive approach to assessment, treatment, and evaluation that includes theoretical principles, clinical indications and contraindications, goals, methodological guidelines and specifications, and the characteristic use of certain procedural sequences and techniques.&quot; In the literature, the terms model, orientation, or approach might be encountered and may have slightly different meanings. Regardless, music therapists use both psychology models and models specific to music therapy. The theories these models are based on include beliefs about human needs, causes of distress, and how humans grow or heal.

Models developed specifically for music therapy include analytical music therapy, Benenzon, the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM), community music therapy, Nordoff-Robbins music therapy (creative music therapy), neurologic music therapy, and vocal psychotherapy.

Psychological orientations used in music therapy include psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, humanistic, existential, and the biomedical model.

=== The Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music ===

To be trained in this method, students are required to be healthcare professionals. Some courses are only open to music therapists and mental health professionals.

Music educator and therapist Helen Lindquist Bonny (1921–2010) developed an approach influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychological views, known as the Bonny Method of guided imagery in music (BGIM or GIM). Guided imagery refers to a technique used in natural and alternative medicine that involves using mental imagery to help with the physiological and psychological ailments of patients.

The practitioner often suggests a relaxing and focusing image, and through the use of imagination and discussion, they aim to find constructive solutions to manage their problems. Bonny applied this psychotherapeutic method to the field of music therapy by using music as the means of guiding the patient to a higher state of consciousness where healing and constructive self-awareness can take place. Music is considered a &quot;co-therapist&quot; because of its importance. GIM with children can be used in one-on-one or group settings, and involves relaxation techniques, identification and sharing of personal feeling states, and improvisation to discover the self, and foster growth. The choice of music is carefully selected for the client based on their musical preferences and the goals of the session. The piece is usually classical, and it must reflect the age and attention abilities of the child in length and genre. A full explanation of the exercises must be offered at their level of understanding.

=== Nordoff-Robbins ===
Paul Nordoff, a Juilliard School graduate and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, gave up his academic career to further investigate the possibility of music as a means for therapy. Clive Robbins, a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for more than 17 years in the exploration and research of music&#x27;s effects on disabled children—first in the UK, and then in the United States in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, emotional disturbances, developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with children with cognitive impairments at the University of Pennsylvania gave rise to the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study &quot;Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at the day care unit&quot; involved research, publication, training and treatment. Several publications, including &quot;Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children&quot;, &quot;Creative Music Therapy&quot;, &quot;Music Therapy in Special Education&quot;, as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins&#x27;s success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989

Today, Nordoff-Robbins is a music therapy &quot;Theoretical Model / Approach&quot;. The Nordoff-Robbins approach, based on the belief that everyone is capable of finding meaning in and benefiting from musical experience, is now practiced by hundreds of therapists internationally. This approach focuses on treatment through the creation of music by both therapist and client together. The therapist uses various techniques so that even the most low functioning individuals can actively participate.

=== Orff ===

Gertrude Orff developed Orff Music Therapy at the Kinderzentrum München. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics and the Orff Schulwerk (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer Carl Orff) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays, and disabilities. Theodor Hellbrügge developed the area of social pediatrics in Germany after the Second World War. He understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of developmentally disabled children. Hellbrügge consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement, the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus for the child to investigate and explore, Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting, and the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.

Corresponding with the attitudes of humanistic psychology, the developmental potential of the child, as in the acknowledgement of their strengths as well as their handicaps, and the importance of the therapist-child relationship, are central factors in Orff music therapy. The strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social pediatrics also influence theoretical foundations. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as &quot;responsive interaction&quot;, in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction by having them participate directly or observe the therapist&#x27;s techniques equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.

=== Liberation Music Therapy ===

Liberation Music Therapy (LMT) is an emancipatory approach to music-making that integrates healing, social justice, and revolutionary change. Rooted in the principles of liberation psychology and influenced by the global history of music&#x27;s role in communal and spiritual practices, LMT challenges traditional, colonialist frameworks of mental health care. It emphasizes addressing systemic oppression and transgenerational trauma through culturally relevant music practices, particularly within marginalized communities. LMT practitioners view music not only as a therapeutic tool but as a form of activism and resistance, fostering solidarity, critical consciousness (concientización), and community empowerment.

This approach combines music&#x27;s therapeutic qualities with its capacity for social and political transformation, drawing on a variety of influences, including folk traditions, hip-hop, drumming, and chanting, alongside modern and classical genres. Through methods such as lyric analysis, improvisation, and collective musicking, LMT bridges personal emotional experiences with broader societal struggles, engaging individuals and communities in processes of healing and liberation. Practitioners work collaboratively, meeting communities where they are and respecting their cultural genius, with the ultimate aim of fostering both individual well-being and collective resilience.

== Cultural aspects ==
Through the ages music has been an integral component of rituals, ceremonies, healing practices, and spiritual and cultural traditions. Further, Michael Bakan, author of &quot;World Music: Traditions and Transformations&quot;, states that &quot;Music is a mode of cultural production and can reveal much about how the culture works,&quot; something ethnomusicologists study.

=== Cultural considerations in music therapy services, education, and research ===
The 21st century is a culturally pluralistic world. In some countries, such as the United States, an individual may have multiple cultural identities that are quite different from the music therapist&#x27;s. These include race; ethnicity, culture, and/or heritage; religion; sex; ability/disability; education; or socioeconomic status. Music therapists strive to achieve &quot;multicultural competence&quot; through a lifelong journey of formal and informal education and self-reflection. Multicultural therapy &quot;uses modalities and defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients&quot; rather than basing therapy on the therapist&#x27;s worldview or the dominant culture&#x27;s norms.

Empathy in general is an important aspect of any mental health practitioner and the same is true for music therapists, as is multicultural awareness. It is the added complexity to cultural empathy that comes from adding music that provides both the greater risk and potential to provide exceptional culturally sensitive therapy (Valentino, 2006). An extensive knowledge of a culture is really needed to provide this effective treatment as providing culturally sensitive music therapy goes beyond knowing the language of speech, the country, or even some background about the culture. Simply choosing music that is from the same country of origin or that has the same spoken language is not effective for providing music therapy as music genres vary as do the messages each piece of music sends. Also, different cultures view and use music in various ways and may not always be the same as how the therapist views and uses music. Melody Schwantes and her colleagues wrote an article that describes the effective use of the Mexican &quot;corrido&quot; in a bereavement group of Mexican migrant farm workers (Schwantes, Wigram, Lipscomb &amp; Richards, 2011). This support group was dealing with the loss of two of their coworkers after an accident they were in and so the corrido, a song form traditionally used for telling stories of the deceased. An important element that was also mentioned was that songwriting has shown to be a large cultural artifact in many cultures, and that there are many subtle messages and thoughts provided in songs that would otherwise be hard to identify. Lastly, the authors of this study stated that &quot;Given the position and importance of songs in all cultures, the example in this therapeutic process demonstrates the powerful nature of lyrics and music to contain and express difficult and often unspoken feelings&quot; (Schwantes &quot;et al.&quot;, 2011).

== Usage by region ==

=== African continent ===
In 1999, the first program for music therapy in Africa opened in Pretoria, South Africa. Research has shown that in Tanzania patients can receive palliative care for life-threatening illnesses directly after the diagnosis of these illnesses. This is different from many Western countries, because they reserve palliative care for patients who have an incurable illness. Music is also viewed differently between Africa and Western countries. In Western countries and a majority of other countries throughout the world, music is traditionally seen as entertainment whereas in many African cultures, music is used in recounting stories, celebrating life events, or sending messages.

=== Australia ===

==== Music for healing in ancient times ====
One of the first groups known to heal with sound were the aboriginal people of Australia. The modern name of their healing tool is the didgeridoo, but it was originally called the yidaki. The yidaki produced sounds that are similar to the sound healing techniques used in modern day. The sound of the didgeridoo produces a low, bass frequency. For at least 40,000 years, the healing tool was believed to assist in healing &quot;broken bones, muscle tears and illnesses of every kind&quot;.
However, here are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo&#x27;s exact age. Archaeological studies of rock art in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the Arnhem Land plateau, from the freshwater period (that had begun 1500 years ago) shows a didgeridoo player and two songmen participating in an Ubarr ceremony.

==== In modern times – an allied health profession ====
1949 in Australia, music therapy (not clinical music therapy as understood today) was started through concerts organized by the Australian Red Cross along with a Red Cross Music Therapy Committee. The key Australian body, the Australian Music Therapy Association (AMTA), was founded in 1975.

=== Canada ===

==== History: c. 1940 – present ====
For earlier history related to Western traditions, see sub-section.

In 1956, Fran Herman, one of Canada&#x27;s music therapy pioneers, began a &#x27;remedial music&#x27; program at the Home For Incurable Children, now known as the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, in Toronto. Her group &#x27;The Wheelchair Players&#x27; continued until 1964, and is considered to be the first music therapy group project in Canada. Its production &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Nightingale&quot; was the subject of a documentary film.

Composer/pianist Alfred Rosé, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, also pioneered the use of music therapy in London, Ontario, at Westminster Hospital in 1952 and at the London Psychiatric Hospital in 1956.

Two other music therapy programs were initiated during the 1950s; one by Norma Sharpe at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in St. Thomas, Ontario, and the other by Thérèse Pageau at the Hôpital St-Jean-de-Dieu (now Hôpital Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine) in Montreal.

A conference in August 1974, organized by Norma Sharpe and six other music therapists, led to the founding of the Canadian Music Therapy Association, which was later renamed the Canadian Association for Music Therapy (CAMT). As of 2009, the organization had more than 500 members.

Canada&#x27;s first music therapy training program was founded in 1976, at Capilano College (now Capilano University) in North Vancouver, by Nancy McMaster and Carolyn Kenny.

=== China ===
The relationship between music therapy and health has long been documented in ancient China.

It is said that in ancient times, really good traditional Chinese medicine did not use acupuncture or traditional Chinese medicine, but music: at the end of a song, people were safe when they were discharged. As early as before the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Canon of internal medicine believed that the five tones (Palace, Shang, horn, emblem and feather) belonged to the five elements (gold, wood, water, fire and earth), and were associated with five basic emotions (joy, anger, worry, thought and fear), that is, the five chronicles. Different music such as palace, Shang, horn, micro and feather were used to target different diseases.

More than 2000 years ago, the book Yue Ji also talked about the important role of music in regulating life harmony and improving health; &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; recorded the famous doctors of the state of Qin and the discussion that music can prevent and treat diseases: &quot;there are six or seven days, the hair is colorless, the emblem is five colors, and sex produces six diseases.&quot; It is emphasized that silence should be controlled and appropriate in order to have a beneficial regulating effect on the human body; The book &quot;the soul and the body flow, the spirit also flows&quot;; Zhang Jingyue and Xu Lingtai, famous medical experts in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, also specially discussed phonology and medicine in the &quot;classics with wings&quot; and &quot;Yuefu Chuansheng&quot;.

For example, Liu Xueyu, one of the emperors of the Tang Dynasty, cured some stubborn diseases through the records of music in the Tang Dynasty.

Chinese contemporary music therapy began in the 1980s. In 1984, Professor Zhang Boyuan of the Department of psychology of Peking University published the experimental report on the research of physical and mental defense of music, which was the first published scientific research article on music therapy in China. In 1986, Professor Gao Tian of Beijing Conservatory of music published his paper &quot;Research on the relieving effect of music on pain&quot;;

In 1989, the Chinese society of therapeutics was officially established. In 1994, pukaiyuan published his monograph music therapy. In 1995, he Huajun and Lu Tingzhu published a monograph music therapy. In 2000, Zhang Hongyi edited and published fundamentals of music therapy. In 2002, fan Xinsheng edited and published music therapy. In 2007, Gao Tian edited and published the basic theory of music therapy.

In short, Chinese music therapy has made rapid progress in theoretical research, literature review and clinical research. In addition, the music therapy methods under the guidance of ancient Chinese music therapy theory and traditional Chinese medicine theory with a long history have attracted worldwide attention. The prospect of Chinese music therapy is broad.

=== Germany ===
The Germany Music Therapy Society defines music therapy as the &quot;targeted use of music as part of a therapeutic relationship to restore, maintain and promote mental, physical and cognitive health [].&quot;

=== India ===
The roots of musical therapy in India can be traced back to ancient Hindu mythology, Vedic texts, and local folk traditions. It is very possible that music therapy has been used for hundreds of years in Indian culture. In the 1990s, another dimension to this, known as Musopathy, was postulated by Indian musician Chitravina Ravikiran based on fundamental criteria derived from acoustic physics.

The Indian Association of Music Therapy was established in 2010 by Dr. Dinesh C. Sharma with a motto &quot;to use pleasant sounds in a specific manner like drug in due course of time as green medicine&quot;. He also published the &quot;International Journal of Music Therapy&quot; (ISSN 2249-8664) to popularize and promote music therapy research on an international platform.

Suvarna Nalapat has studied music therapy in the Indian context. Her books &quot;Nadalayasindhu-Ragachikitsamrutam&quot; (2008), &quot;Music Therapy in Management Education and Administration&quot; (2008) and &quot;Ragachikitsa&quot; (2008) are accepted textbooks on music therapy and Indian arts.

The Music Therapy Trust of India is another venture in the country. It was started by Margaret Lobo. She is the founder and director of the Otakar Kraus Music Trust and her work began in 2004.

=== Lebanon ===
In 2006, Hamda Farhat introduced music therapy to Lebanon, developing and inventing therapeutic methods such as the triple method to treat hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, addiction, and post traumatic stress disorder. She has met with great success in working with many international organizations, and in the training of therapists, educators, and doctors. The Lebanese Association Of Music Therapy L.A.M.T ref number 65 is the only reference at Lebanon, the president Dr Hamda farhat, members administer Dr Antoine chartouni, Dr Elia Francis Safi 
TRAINING and Formation

=== Norway ===
Norway is recognized as an important country for music therapy research. Its two major research centers are the Center for Music and Health with the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, and the Grieg Academy Centre for Music Therapy (GAMUT), at University of Bergen. The former was mostly developed by professor Even Ruud, while professor Brynjulf Stige is largely responsible for cultivating the latter. The center in Bergen has 18 staff, including 2 professors and 4 associate professors, as well as lecturers and PhD students. Two of the field&#x27;s major international research journals are based in Bergen: &quot;Nordic Journal for Music Therapy&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Norway&#x27;s main contribution to the field is mostly in the area of &quot;community music therapy&quot;, which tends to be as much oriented toward social work as individual psychotherapy, and music therapy research from this country uses a wide variety of methods to examine diverse methods across an array of social contexts, including community centers, medical clinics, retirement homes, and prisons.

=== Nigeria ===
The origins of Musical therapy practices in Nigeria is unknown, however the country is identified to have a lengthy lineage and history of musical therapy being utilized throughout the culture. The most common people associated with music therapy are herbalists, Witch doctors, and faith healers according to Professor Charles O. Aluede of Ambrose Alli University (Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria). Applying music and thematic sounds to the healing process is believed to help the patient overcome true sickness in his/her mind which then will seemingly cure the disease. Another practice involving music is called &quot;Igbeuku&quot;, a religious practice performed by faith healers. In the practice of Igbeuku, patients are persuaded to confess their sins which cause themselves serve discomfort. Following a confession, patients feel emotionally relieved because the priest has announced them clean and subjected them to a rigorous dancing exercise. The dancing exercise is a &quot;thank you&quot; for the healing and tribute to the spiritual greater beings. The dance is accompanied by music and can be included among the unorthodox medical practices of Nigerian culture. While most of the music therapy practices come in the medical field, musical therapy is often used in the passing of a loved one. The use of song and dance in a funeral setting is very common across the continent but especially in Nigeria. Songs allude to the idea the finally resting place is Hades (hell). The music helps alleviate the sorrows felt by the family members and friends of the lost loved one. Along with music therapy being a practice for funeral events, it is also implemented to those dying as a last resort tactic of healing. The Esan of Edo State of Nigeria, in particular, herbalists perform practices with an Oko – a small aerophone made of elephant tusk which is blown into dying patients&#x27; ears to resuscitate them. Nigeria is full of interesting cultural practices in which contribute a lot to the music therapy world.

=== South Africa ===
There are longstanding traditions of music healing, which in some ways may be very different than music therapy.

Mercédès Pavlicevic (1955–2018), an international music therapist, along with Kobie Temmingh, pioneered the music therapy program at the University of Pretoria, which debuted with a master&#x27;s degree program in 1999. She noted the differences in longstanding traditions and other ways of viewing healing or music. A Nigerian colleague felt &quot;that music in Africa is healing, and what is music therapy other than some colonial import?&quot; Pavlicevic noted that &quot;in Africa there is a long tradition of music healing&quot; and asked &quot;Can there be a synthesis of these two music-based practices towards something new?... &quot;I&quot; &quot;am not altogether convinced that African music healing and music therapy are especially closely related&quot; [emphasis added]. But I am utterly convinced that music therapy can learn an enormous amount from the African worldview and from music-making in Africa – rather than from African music-healing as such.&quot;

The South African Music Therapy Association can provide information to the public about music therapy or educational programs in South Africa.

South Africa was selected to host the 16th World Congress of Music Therapy in July 2020, a triennial World Federation of Music Therapy event. Due to the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) the congress was moved to an online event.

The states of California and Connecticut have title protection for music therapists, meaning only those with the MT-BC credential can use the title &quot;Board Certified Music Therapist&quot;.

==== Professional association ====
The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA).

==== Education ====

Publication on music therapy education and training has been detailed in both single author (Goodman, 2011) and edited (Goodman, 2015, 2023) volumes. The register of the European Music Therapy Confederation lists all educational training programs throughout Europe.

A music therapy degree candidate can earn an undergraduate, master&#x27;s or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs in the United States offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed a degree in a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held PhDs either in music therapy or in fields related to music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered within the context of a social service, educational, or health care agency are often reimbursable by insurance or other sources of funding for individuals with certain needs.

A degree in music therapy requires proficiency in guitar, piano, voice, music theory, music history, reading music, improvisation, as well as varying levels of skill in assessment, documentation, and other counseling and health care skills depending on the focus of the particular university&#x27;s program. 1200 hours of clinical experience are required, some of which are gained during an approximately six-month internship that takes place after all other degree requirements are met.

After successful completion of educational requirements, including internship, music therapists can apply to take, take, and pass the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy.

==== Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy ====
The current national credential is MT-BC (Music Therapist-Board Certified). It is not required in all states. To be eligible to apply to take the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy, an individual must successfully complete a music therapy degree from a program accredited by AMTA at a college or university (or have a bachelor&#x27;s degree and complete all of the music therapy course requirements from an accredited program), which includes successfully completing a music therapy internship. To maintain the credential, 100 units of continuing education must be completed every five years. The board exam is created by and administered through The Certification Board for Music Therapists.

==== History: –present ====
For earlier history related to Western traditions, see sub-section.

From a western viewpoint, music therapy in the 20th and 21st centuries (as of 2021), as an evidence-based, allied healthcare profession, grew out of the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers suffering from with war-related emotional and physical trauma. Using music to treat the mental and physical ailments of active duty military and veterans was not new. Its use was recorded during the U.S. Civil War and Florence Nightingale used it a decade earlier in the Crimean War. Despite research data, observations by doctors and nurses, praise from patients, and willing musicians, it was difficult to vastly increase music therapy services or establish lasting music therapy education programs or organizations in the early 20th century. However, many of the music therapy leaders of this time period provided music therapy during WWI or to its veterans. These were pioneers in the field such as &quot;Eva Vescelius&quot;, musician, author, 1903 founder of the short-lived National Therapeutic Society of New York and the 1913 &quot;Music and Health&quot; journal, and creator/teacher of a musicotherapy course; &quot;Margaret Anderton&quot;, pianist, WWI music therapy provider for Canadian soldiers, a strong believer in training for music therapists, and 1919 Columbia University musicotherapy teacher; &quot;Isa Maud Ilsen&quot;, a nurse and musician who was the American Red Cross Director of Hospital Music in WWI reconstruction hospitals, 1919 Columbia University musicotherapy teacher, 1926 founder of the National Association for Music in Hospitals, and author; and &quot;Harriet Ayer Seymour&quot;, music therapist to WWI veterans, author, researcher, lecturer/teacher, founder of the &quot;National Foundation for Music Therapy&quot; in 1941, author of the first music therapy textbook published in the US. Several physicians also promoted music as a therapeutic agent during this time period.

In the 1940s, changes in philosophy regarding care of psychiatric patients as well as the influx of WWII veterans in Veterans Administration hospitals renewed interest in music programs for patients. Many musicians volunteered to provide entertainment and were primarily assigned to perform on psychiatric wards. Positive changes in patients&#x27; mental and physical health were noted by nurses. The volunteer musicians, many of whom had degrees in music education, becoming aware of the powerful effects music could have on patients realized that specialized training was necessary. The first music therapy bachelor&#x27;s degree program was established in 1944 with three others and one master&#x27;s degree program quickly following: &quot;Michigan State College [now a University] (1944), the University of Kansas [master&#x27;s degree only] (1946), the College of the Pacific (1947), The Chicago Musical College (1948) and Alverno College (1948).&quot; The &quot;National Association for Music Therapy&quot; (NAMT), a professional association, was formed in 1950. In 1956, the first music therapy credential in the US, Registered Music Therapist (RMT), was instituted by the NAMT.

The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) was founded in 1998 as a merger between the National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT, founded in 1950) and the American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT, founded in 1971).

=== United Kingdom ===
Live music was used in hospitals after both World Wars as part of the treatment program for recovering soldiers. Clinical music therapy in Britain as it is understood today was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by French cellist Juliette Alvin whose influence on the current generation of British music therapy lecturers remains strong. Mary Priestley, one of Juliette Alvin&#x27;s students, created &quot;analytical music therapy&quot;. The Nordoff-Robbins approach to music therapy developed from the work of Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins in the 1950/60s.

Practitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council and, starting from 2007, new registrants must normally hold a master&#x27;s degree in music therapy. There are master&#x27;s level programs in music therapy in Manchester, Bristol, Cambridge, South Wales, Edinburgh and London, and there are therapists throughout the UK. The professional body in the UK is the British Association for Music Therapy In 2002, the World Congress of Music Therapy, coordinated and promoted by the World Federation of Music Therapy, was held in Oxford on the theme of Dialogue and Debate. In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues again found that music therapy helped the outcomes of schizophrenic patients.

== Military: active duty, veterans, family members ==

=== History ===
Music therapy finds its roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which described the use of music in the recovery of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal of the study was to understand whether &quot;music presented according to a specific plan&quot; influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.

The first university sponsored music therapy course was taught by Margaret Anderton in 1919 at Columbia University. Anderton&#x27;s clinical specialty was working with wounded Canadian soldiers during World War II, using music-based services to aid in their recovery process.

Today, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have both presented an array of injuries; however, the two signature injuries are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). These two signature injuries are increasingly common among millennial military service members and in music therapy programs.

A person diagnosed with PTSD can associate a memory or experience with a song they have heard. This can result in either good or bad experiences. If it is a bad experience, the song&#x27;s rhythm or lyrics can bring out the person&#x27;s anxiety or fear response. If it is a good experience, the song can bring feelings of happiness or peace which could bring back positive emotions. Either way, music can be used as a tool to bring emotions forward and help the person cope with them.

=== Methods ===
Music therapists work with active duty military personnel, veterans, service members in transition, and their families. Music therapists strive to engage clients in music experiences that foster trust and complete participation over the course of their treatment process. Music therapists use an array of music-centered tools, techniques, and activities when working with military-associated clients, many of which are similar to the techniques used in other music therapy settings. These methods include, but are not limited to: group drumming, listening, singing, and songwriting. Songwriting is a particularly effective tool with military veterans struggling with PTSD and TBI as it creates a safe space to, &quot;... work through traumatic experiences, and transform traumatic memories into healthier associations&quot;.
=== Programs ===
Music therapy in the military is seen in programs on military bases, VA healthcare facilities, military treatment facilities, and military communities. Music therapy programs have a large outreach because they exist for all phases of military life: pre-mobilization, deployment, post-deployment, recovery (in the case of injury), and among families of fallen military service personnel.

The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) also exists to provide music therapy services to active duty military families who have a family member with a developmental, physical, emotional, or intellectual disorder. Currently, programs at the Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, Resounding Joy, Inc., and the Music Institute of Chicago partner with EFMP services to provide music therapy services to eligible military family members.

Music therapy programs primarily target active duty military members and their treatment facility to provide reconditioning among members convalescing in Army hospitals. Although, music therapy programs not only benefit the military but rather a wide range of clients including the U.S. Air Force, American Navy, and U.S. Marines Corp. Individuals exposed to trauma benefit from their essential rehabilitative tools to follow the course of recovery from stress disorders. Music therapists are certified professionals who possess the abilities to determine appropriate interventions to support one recovering from a physically, emotionally, or mentally traumatic experience. In addition to their skills, they play an integral part throughout the treatment process of service members diagnosed with post-traumatic stress or brain injuries. In many cases, self-expression through songwriting or using instruments help restore emotions that can be lost following trauma. Music has a significant effect on troops traveling overseas or between bases because many soldiers view music to be an escape from war, a connection to their homeland and families, or as motivation. By working with a certified music therapist, marines undergo sessions re-instituting concepts of cognition, memory attention, and emotional processing. Although programs primarily focus on phases of military life, other service members such as the U.S. Air Force are eligible for treatment as well. For instance, during a music therapy session, a man begins to play a song to a wounded Airmen. The Airmen says &quot;[music] allows me to talk about something that happened without talking about it&quot;. Music allows the active duty airmen to open up about previous experiences while reducing his anxiety level.

== History ==
The use of music to soothe grief has been used since the time of David and King Saul. In I Samuel, David plays the lyre to make King Saul feel relieved and better. It has since been used all over the world for treatment of various issues, though the first recorded use of official &quot;music therapy&quot; was in 1789 – an article titled &quot;Music Physically Considered&quot; by an unknown author was found in &quot;Columbian Magazine&quot;. The creation and expansion of music therapy as a treatment modality thrived in the early to mid 1900s and while a number of organizations were created, none survived for long. It was not until 1950 that the National Association for Music Therapy was founded in New York that clinical training and certification requirements were created. In 1971, the American Association for Music Therapy was created, though at that time called the Urban Federation of Music Therapists. The Certification Board for Music Therapists was created in 1983 which strengthened the practice of music therapy and the trust that it was given. In 1998, the American Music Therapy Association was formed out of a merger between National and American Associations and as of 2017 is the single largest music therapy organization in the world (American music therapy, 1998–2011).

Ancient flutes, carved from ivory and bone, were found by archaeologists, that were determined to be from as far back as 43,000 years ago. He also states that &quot;The earliest fragment of musical notation is found on a 4,000-year-old Sumerian clay tablet, which includes instructions and tuning for a hymn honoring the ruler Lipit-Ishtar. But for the title of oldest extant song, most historians point to &quot;Hurrian Hymn No. 6,&quot; an ode to the goddess Nikkal that was composed in cuneiform by the ancient Hurrian&#x27;s sometime around the 14th century B.C.&quot;.

=== Western cultures ===
==== Music and healing ====
Music has been used as a healing implement for centuries. Apollo is the ancient Greek god of music and of medicine and his son Aesculapius was said to cure diseases of the mind by using song and music. By 5000 BC, music was used for healing by Egyptian priest-physicians. Plato said that music affected the emotions and could influence the character of an individual. Aristotle taught that music affects the soul and described music as a force that purified the emotions. Aulus Cornelius Celsus advocated the sound of cymbals and running water for the treatment of mental disorders. Music as therapy was practiced in the Bible when David played the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit (1 Sam 16:23). As early as 400 B.C., Hippocrates played music for mental patients. In the 13th century, Arab hospitals contained music-rooms for the benefit of the patients. In the United States, Native American medicine men often employed chants and dances as a method of healing patients. The Turco-Persian psychologist and music theorist al-Farabi (872–950), known as Alpharabius in Europe, dealt with music for healing in his treatise &quot;Meanings of the Intellect&quot;, in which he discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul. In his &quot;De vita libri tres&quot; published in 1489, Platonist Marsilio Ficino gives a lengthy account of how music and songs can be used to draw celestial benefits for staying healthy. Robert Burton wrote in the 17th century in his classic work, &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia.

The rise of an understanding of the body and mind in terms of the nervous system led to the emergence of a new wave of music for healing in the 18th century. Earlier works on the subject, such as Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot; of 1650 and even early 18th-century books such as Michael Ernst Ettmüller&#x27;s 1714 &quot;Disputatio effectus musicae in hominem&quot; (Disputation on the Effect of Music on Man) or Friedrich Erhardt Niedten&#x27;s 1717 &quot;Veritophili&quot;, still tended to discuss the medical effects of music in terms of bringing the soul and body into harmony. But from the mid-18th century works on the subject such as Richard Brocklesby&#x27;s 1749 &quot;Reflections of Antient and Modern Musick&quot;, the 1737 &quot;Memoires&quot; of the French Academy of Sciences, or Ernst Anton Nicolai&#x27;s 1745 (The Connection of Music to Medicine), stressed the power of music over the nerves.

==== Music therapy: 19th century ====
After 1800, some books on music and medicine drew on the Brunonian system of medicine, arguing that the stimulation of the nerves caused by music could directly improve or harm health. Throughout the 19th century, an impressive number of books and articles were authored by physicians in Europe and the United States discussing use of music as a therapeutic agent to treat both mental and physical illness.

==== Music therapy: 1900 – ====
From a western viewpoint, music therapy in the 20th and 21st centuries (as of 2021), as an evidence-based, allied healthcare profession, grew out of the aftermath of World Wars I and II. Particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers with war-related emotional and physical trauma. Using music to treat the mental and physical ailments of active duty military and veterans was not new. Its use was recorded during the US Civil War and Florence Nightingale used it a decade earlier in the Crimean War. Despite research data, observations by doctors and nurses, praise from patients, and willing musicians, it was difficult to vastly increase music therapy services or establish lasting music therapy education programs or organizations in the early 20th century. However, many of the music therapy leaders of this time period provided music therapy during WWI or to its veterans.

Several physicians also promoted music as a therapeutic agent during this time period.

In the United States, the first music therapy bachelor&#x27;s degree program was established in 1944 at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University).

<text>Susannah of the Mounties is a children&#x27;s novel by Canadian author Muriel Denison, first published in 1936. In the book 9-year-old Susannah is sent to Regina, Saskatchewan to spend the summer with her uncle who is a Mountie. There are several sequels to the book: &quot;Susannah at Boarding School&quot;, &quot;Susannah of the Yukon&quot; and &quot;Susannah Rides Again&quot;. 

==Film adaptation==

In 1939 it was adapted into the film &quot;Susannah of the Mounties&quot; starring Shirley Temple as Susannah. The movie plot differs significantly from the book: it is set twenty years earlier at a much smaller Mounted Police fort and Susannah&#x27;s parents are dead rather than in India, while the character of the uncle is omitted. The film is a U.S. version of the West rather than the Canadian West of the book.

<text>Eugen Weidmann (5 February 1908 – 17 June 1939) was a German criminal and serial killer who was executed by guillotine in France in June 1939, the last public execution in France.

==Early life==
Weidmann was born in Frankfurt am Main to the family of an export businessman and went to school there. He was sent to live with his grandparents at the outbreak of World War I. During this time he started stealing. Later in his twenties, he served five years in Saarbrücken jail for robbery.

During his time in jail, Weidmann met two men who would later become his partners in crime: Roger Million and Jean Blanc. After their release from jail, they decided to work together to kidnap rich tourists visiting France and steal their money. They rented a villa in Saint-Cloud near Paris for this purpose.

==Murders==
Their first kidnapping attempt ended in failure because their victim struggled too hard, forcing them to let him go. In July 1937, they made a second attempt, Weidmann having made the acquaintance of Jean De Koven, a 22-year-old New York City dancer visiting her aunt Ida Sackheim in Paris. Impressed by the tall, handsome German, De Koven wrote to a friend: &quot;I have just met a charming German of keen intelligence who calls himself Siegfried. Perhaps I am going to another Wagnerian role – who knows? I am going to visit him tomorrow at his villa in a beautiful place near a famous mansion that Napoleon gave Josephine.&quot; During their meeting they smoked, and &quot;Siegfried&quot; gave her a glass of milk. De Koven took photos of Weidmann with her new camera (later found beside her body; the developed film showed her killer). Weidmann then strangled and buried her in the villa&#x27;s garden. She had 300 francs in cash and $430 in traveller&#x27;s cheques, which the group sent Million&#x27;s mistress, Colette Tricot, to cash. Sackheim received a letter demanding $500 for the return of her niece. De Koven&#x27;s brother Henry later came to France offering a 10,000-franc reward from his father, Abraham, for information about the young woman.

On 1 September that year, Weidmann hired a chauffeur named Joseph Couffy to drive him to the French Riviera where, in a forest outside Tours, he shot Couffy in the back of his neck and stole his car and 2,500 francs. The next murder came on 3 September, after Weidmann and Million lured Janine Keller, a private nurse, into a cave in the forest of Fontainebleau with a job offer. Weidmann killed Keller with another fatal shot to the back of the neck, before robbing her body of 1,400 francs and a diamond ring. On 16 October, Million and Weidmann arranged a meeting with a young theatrical producer named Roger LeBlond, promising to invest money in one of his shows. Instead, Weidmann shot him in the back of his head and took his wallet containing 5,000 francs. On 22 November, Weidmann murdered and robbed Fritz Frommer, a young German he had met in jail. Frommer, a Jew, had been held there for his anti-Nazi views. Once again, the victim was shot in the back of his neck. His body was buried in the basement of the Saint-Cloud house where De Koven&#x27;s body was interred. Five days later, Weidmann committed his final murder. Raymond Lesobre, a real estate agent, was shot in the killer&#x27;s preferred fashion while showing him around a house in Saint-Cloud. Five thousand francs were taken from him.

==Arrest==
Officers from the Sûreté, led by a young inspector named Primborgne, eventually tracked Weidmann to the villa from a business card left at Lesobre&#x27;s office. Arriving at his home, Weidmann found two officers waiting for him. Inviting them in, he then turned and fired three times at them with a pistol. Although they were unarmed, the wounded Sûreté men managed to wrestle Weidmann down and knocked him unconscious with a hammer, which happened to be nearby.

Weidmann, a highly cooperative prisoner, confessed to all his murders, including that of de Koven, the only one for which he expressed regret. He is reported to have said tearfully: &quot;She was gentle and unsuspecting... When I reached for her throat, she went down like a doll.&quot;

The murder trial of Weidmann, Million, Blanc and Tricot in Versailles in March 1939 was the biggest since that of Henri Désiré Landru, the modern-day &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, 18 years earlier. One of Weidmann&#x27;s lawyers, Vincent de Moro-Giafferi, had defended Landru. Also present was the French novelist Colette, who was engaged by &quot;Paris-Soir&quot; to write an essay on Weidmann.

Weidmann and Million received the death sentence, Blanc received a prison sentence of twenty months and Tricot was acquitted. Million&#x27;s sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.

==Execution==
On 17 June 1939, Weidmann was beheaded outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles. The &quot;hysterical behaviour&quot; by spectators was so scandalous that French President Albert Lebrun immediately banned all future public executions. (Executions by guillotine continued out of public view until the last such execution, of Hamida Djandoubi on 10 September 1977.)

Christopher Lee, who was then seventeen years old, witnessed the event. Footage of the execution with him in the frame was eventually restored and used in &quot;Faces of Death 3&quot;. Nearly half a century later, he portrayed headsman Charles-Henri Sanson in a 1989 French TV drama about the French Revolution, in which his character made frequent use of the device.

<text>Heather Marie Mercer (born 1976) is an American who was one of 24 aid workers arrested in August 2001 by the Taliban in Afghanistan in connection with the Antioch International Movement of Churches and Germany-based Christian aid organization Shelter Now International. She, along with seven other Western aid workers and their sixteen Afghan coworkers, was arrested on August 3, 2001, and put on trial for violating the Taliban prohibition against proselytism. She was held captive in Kabul until anti-Taliban forces freed her in November 2001. She co-authored a book with her fellow captive, Dayna Curry, published in 2002 and entitled &quot;Prisoners of hope: the story of our captivity and freedom in Afghanistan.&quot;

== Afghan trial ==
Mercer arrived in Afghanistan in March 2001. She and another American, Dayna Curry, were sent by Antioch Community Church and working for a Germany-based aid group called Shelter Now International.

On August 3, 2001, the Taliban arrested the two women. After their arrest, the Taliban raided the group&#x27;s offices and arrested the six other aid workers that Mercer and Curry were teamed up with.

Their trial began on September 1, 2001. On September 13, the trial was suspended and relatives of the detained aid workers were ordered to leave the country. The trial resumed on September 30. On October 6, the Taliban made an offer to release Mercer and Curry if the United States stopped its military action in Afghanistan. During her captivity, she met the British journalist Yvonne Ridley, who was arrested near the Pakistan border and brought to the same prison in Kabul. Ridley informed her about the September 11 attacks and the subsequent military actions against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. On November 15, the women, along with the six other imprisoned aid workers, were freed from prison by anti-Taliban forces and flown to safety in Islamabad, Pakistan.

After their release, and upon their return to the U.S., Mercer and Curry met with President George W. Bush at the White House on November 26, 2001.

<text>William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, (5 March 1879 – 16 March 1963) was a British economist and Liberal politician who was a progressive, social reformer, and eugenicist who played a central role in designing the British welfare state. His 1942 report &quot;Social Insurance and Allied Services&quot; (known as the Beveridge Report) served as the basis for the welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945.

He built his career as an expert on unemployment insurance. He served on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges, and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford.

Beveridge published widely on unemployment and social security, his most notable works being: &quot;Unemployment: A Problem of Industry&quot; (1909), &quot;Planning Under Socialism&quot; (1936), &quot;Full Employment in a Free Society&quot; (1944), &quot;Pillars of Security&quot; (1943), &quot;Power and Influence&quot; (1953) and &quot;A Defence of Free Learning&quot; (1959). He was elected in the 1944 Berwick-upon-Tweed by-election as a Liberal MP; following his defeat in the 1945 general election, he was elevated to the House of Lords where he served as the leader of the Liberal peers.

==Early life and education==

Beveridge, the eldest son of Henry Beveridge, an Indian Civil Service officer and District Judge, and scholar Annette Ackroyd, was born in Rangpur, India (now in Bangladesh), on 5 March 1879.

Beveridge&#x27;s mother had, with Elizabeth Malleson, founded the Working Women&#x27;s College in Queen Square, London in 1864. She met and married Henry Beveridge in Calcutta where she had gone in 1873 to open a school for Indian girls. William Beveridge was educated at Charterhouse, a leading public school near the market town of Godalming in Surrey, followed by Balliol College at the University of Oxford, where he studied Mathematics and Classics, obtaining a first class degree in both. He later studied law.

While Beveridge&#x27;s mother had been a member of the Stourbridge Unitarian community, his father was an early humanist and positivist activist and &quot;an ardent disciple&quot; of the French philosopher Auguste Comte. Comte&#x27;s ideas of a secular religion of humanity were a prominent influence in the household and would exert a lasting influence on Beveridge&#x27;s thinking. Beveridge himself became a &quot;materialist agnostic&quot;, in his words.

==Life and career==

After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the &quot;Morning Post&quot; newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges.

In 1908, now considered to be Britain&#x27;s leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food.

In 1919, he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists – in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 &quot;Poor Laws&quot; report – that he could be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909). The Fabians made him director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots. From 1929 he led the International scientific committee on price history, contributing a large historical study, &quot;Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1939).

In 1933, he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council, which helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford.

==Wartime work==
Three years later, Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labour in the wartime National government, invited Beveridge to take charge of the Welfare department of his Ministry. Beveridge refused, but declared an interest in organising British manpower in wartime (Beveridge had come to favour a strong system of centralised planning). Bevin was reluctant to let Beveridge have his way but did commission him to work on a relatively unimportant manpower survey from June 1940, and so Beveridge became a temporary civil servant. Neither Bevin nor the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry Sir Thomas Phillips liked working with Beveridge as both found him conceited.

His work on manpower culminated in his chairmanship of the Committee on Skilled Men in the Services which reported to the War Cabinet in August and October 1941. Two recommendations of the committee were implemented: Army recruits were enlisted for their first six weeks into the General Service Corps, so that their subsequent posting could take account of their skills and the Army&#x27;s needs; and the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers was created.

===Report on social insurance and views on full employment===
An opportunity for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health Ernest Brown announced the formation of a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio Arthur Greenwood, and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested and seeing the committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.

The report to Parliament on &quot;Social Insurance and Allied Services&quot; was published in November 1942. It proposed that all people of working age should pay a weekly national insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed. Beveridge argued that this system would provide a minimum standard of living &quot;below which no one should be allowed to fall&quot;. It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the &quot;five giants on the road of reconstruction&quot; of Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Beveridge included as one of three fundamental assumptions the fact that there would be a National Health Service of some sort, a policy already being worked on in the Ministry of Health.

Beveridge&#x27;s arguments were widely accepted. He appealed to conservatives and other sceptics by arguing that welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.

Beveridge saw full employment (defined as unemployment of no more than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. &quot;Full Employment in a Free Society&quot;, written in 1944 expressed the view that it was &quot;absurd&quot; to &quot;look to individual employers for maintenance of demand and full employment.&quot; These things must be &quot;undertaken by the State under the supervision and pressure of democracy.&quot; Measures for achieving full-employment might include Keynesian-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge&#x27;s thinking was social justice, and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.

== Global policy ==
Along with Albert Einstein, Beveridge was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

He was also one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Later career==

Later in 1944, Beveridge, who had recently joined the Liberal Party, was elected to the Commons in a by-election for the Berwick-upon-Tweed seat to succeed George Charles Grey, who had died on the battlefield in Normandy, France, on the first day of Operation Bluecoat on 30 July 1944. During his time as a Member of Parliament he was prominent in the Radical Action group, which called for the party to withdraw from the war-time electoral pact and adopt more radical policies. He lost his seat at the 1945 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative candidate, Robert Thorp, by a majority of 1,962 votes.

Clement Attlee and the Labour Party defeated Winston Churchill&#x27;s Conservative Party in that election and the new Labour Government began the process of implementing Beveridge&#x27;s proposals that provided the basis of the modern Welfare State. Attlee announced he would introduce the Welfare State outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a National Health Service in 1948 with taxpayer funded medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide &quot;social security&quot; so that the population would be protected from the &quot;cradle to the grave&quot;. The new system was partly built upon the National Insurance scheme set up by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1911.

In 1946, Beveridge was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Beveridge, of Tuggal in the County of Northumberland, and eventually became leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords. He was the author of &quot;Power and Influence&quot; (1953). He was the President of the charity Attend (then the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1952 to 1962.

==Eugenics==

Beveridge was a member of the Eugenics Society, which promoted the study of methods to &#x27;improve&#x27; the human race by controlling reproduction. In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state &quot;but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood.&quot; Whilst director of the London School of Economics, Beveridge attempted to create a Department of Social Biology. Though never fully established, Lancelot Hogben, a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its chair. Former LSE director John Ashworth speculated that discord between those in favour and those against the serious study of eugenics led to Beveridge&#x27;s departure from the school in 1937.

In the 1940s, Beveridge credited the Eugenics Society with promoting the children&#x27;s allowance, which was incorporated into his 1942 report. However, whilst he held views in support of eugenics, he did not believe the report had any overall &quot;eugenic value&quot;. Professor Danny Dorling said that &quot;there is not even the faintest hint&quot; of eugenic thought in the report.

Dennis Sewell states that &quot;On the day the House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author slipped out of the gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House. ... His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect. ... The idea of child allowances had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, to limit the number of children born to poor households. For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents. ... The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a flat rate of child allowance. But Beveridge, alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the flat rate would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists.&quot; &#x27;Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that graded family allowance schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his flat rate scheme,&#x27; reported the &quot;Eugenics Review&quot;.

==Personal life==

Beveridge married the mathematician Janet Philip, daughter of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942. They had worked together in the civil service and at LSE, and she was instrumental in the drafting and publicising of the Beveridge Report.

He died at his home on 16 March 1963, aged 84, and was buried in Thockrington churchyard, on the Northumbrian moors. His barony became extinct upon his death. His last words were &quot;I have a thousand things to do&quot;.

==Commemoration==
Beveridge Street in the Christchurch Central City was named for William Beveridge. It was one of 120 streets that were renamed in 1948 by Peter Fraser&#x27;s Labour Government of New Zealand.

In November 2018, English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque commemorating Beveridge at 27 Bedford Gardens in Campden Hill, London W8 7EF where he lived from 1914 until 1921.

University College, Oxford&#x27;s society for students studying and tutors involved in the study of Philosophy, Politics and Economics was renamed the Beveridge Society in his honour.

<doc id="217677" wikidata="Q225509" url="?curid=217677" title="Susannah York">
<text>Susannah Yolande Fletcher (9 January 1939 – 15 January 2011), known professionally as Susannah York, was an English actress. Her appearances in various films of the 1960s, including &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963) and &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), formed the basis of her international reputation. An obituary in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; characterised her as &quot;the blue-eyed English rose with the china-white skin and cupid lips who epitomised the sensuality of the swinging sixties&quot;, who later &quot;proved that she was a real actor of extraordinary emotional range&quot;.

York&#x27;s early films included &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1961) and &quot;&quot; (1962). She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; She also won the 1972 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for &quot;Images&quot;. Her other film appearances included &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot; (1965), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; (1968), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1970), &quot;X Y &amp; Zee&quot; (1972), &quot;Gold&quot; (1974), &quot;The Maids&quot; (1975), &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; (1975), &quot;Eliza Fraser&quot; (1976), &quot;The Shout&quot; (1978), &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). She was appointed an Officier de L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1991.

==Early life==
York was born in Chelsea, London, in 1939, the younger daughter of Simon William Peel Vickers Fletcher (1910–2002), a merchant banker and steel magnate, and his first wife, the former Joan Nita Mary Bowring. They married in 1935, and divorced prior to 1943. Her maternal grandfather was Walter Andrew Bowring, CBE, a British diplomat who served as Administrator of Dominica (1933–1935); she was a great-great-granddaughter of political economist Sir John Bowring. York had an elder sister, as well as a half-brother, Eugene Xavier Charles William Peel Fletcher, from her father&#x27;s second marriage to Pauline de Bearnez de Morton de La Chapelle.

In early 1943, York&#x27;s mother married a Scottish businessman, Adam M. Hamilton, and moved, with her daughter, to Scotland. At the age of 11, York entered Marr College in Troon, Ayrshire. Later, she became a boarder at Wispers School in Midhurst, Sussex. At 13, she was removed, effectively expelled, from Wispers after admitting to a nude midnight swim in the school pool, and she transferred to East Haddon Hall School in Northamptonshire.

Enthusiastic about her experiences of acting at school (she had played an ugly sister in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the age of nine), York first decided to apply to the Glasgow College of Dramatic Art, but after her mother had separated from her stepfather and moved to London, she instead auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At RADA, where her classmates included Peter O&#x27;Toole, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and future Beatles manager Brian Epstein, she won the Ronson award for most promising student before graduating in 1958.

==Career==

===Film===

Her film career began with &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960), co-starring with Alec Guinness and John Mills. In 1961, she played the leading role in &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot;, which co-starred Kenneth More and Danielle Darrieux. In 1962, she performed in &quot;&quot; with Montgomery Clift in the title role.

York played Sophie Western opposite Albert Finney in the Oscar-winning Best Film &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963). She had turned the part down three times and only agreed to participate because she felt guilty over cooking a disastrous meal for the director Tony Richardson, who was determined not to accept her refusal. She also appeared in &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964) with William Holden, &quot;Kaleidescope&quot; (1966), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; (1968) and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969). In 1970 she co-starred with George C. Scott (as Edward Rochester), playing the title role in an American television movie of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, and played opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Country Dance&quot;.

York was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969). She snubbed the Academy when, regarding her nomination, she declared it offended her to be nominated without being asked. She was highly praised for her performance, though she said &quot;I don&#x27;t think much of the film, or of myself in it.&quot; She did attend the ceremony but lost to Goldie Hawn for her role in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;.

In 1972, she won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in &quot;Images&quot;. She played Superman&#x27;s mother Lara on the doomed planet Krypton in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and its sequels, &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980) and &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987, voice role). York made extensive appearances in British television series, including &quot;Prince Regent&quot; (1979), as Maria Fitzherbert, the clandestine wife of the future George IV, and &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot; (1982).

In 1984, York starred as Mrs. Cratchit in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1984), based on the novel by Charles Dickens. She again co-starred with George C. Scott (as Ebenezer Scrooge), David Warner (Bob Cratchit), Frank Finlay (Jacob Marley), Angela Pleasence (The Ghost of Christmas Past) and Anthony Walters (Tiny Tim).

In 1992, she was a member of the jury at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1997, York starred as Olivia in the British comedy &quot;Loop&quot; co-starring with Andy Serkis, based on the script by Tim Pears.

In 2003, York had a recurring role as hospital manager Helen Grant in the BBC1 television drama series &quot;Holby City&quot;. She reprised this role in two episodes of &quot;Holby City&quot;&#x27;s sister series &quot;Casualty&quot; in May 2004. Her last film was &quot;The Calling&quot;, released in 2010 in the UK.

She was a patron of the Children&#x27;s Film Unit and appeared in several of their films.

===Stage===

In 1978, York appeared on stage at the New End Theatre in London in &quot;The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs&quot; with Lucinda Childs, directed by French director Simone Benmussa. This was the first of 10 projects she completed with the producer Richard Jackson. The following year, she appeared in Paris, speaking French in a play by Henry James: &quot;Appearances&quot;, with Sami Frey. The play was again directed by Benmussa.

In the 1980s, again with Benmussa, York played in &quot;For No Good Reason&quot;, an adaptation of George Moore&#x27;s short story, with Susan Hampshire. In 1985, she appeared in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; by Bernard Slade at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. In 1986-87, York starred as Mary in Claire Boothe&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot; at the Old Vic, a production that included Maria Aitken, Diana Quick and Georgina Hale.

In 2007, she appeared in the UK tour of &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, and continued performing her internationally well-received solo show, &quot;The Loves of Shakespeare&#x27;s Women&quot;. Also in 2007, she guest starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;Valhalla&quot;. In 2008, she played the part of Nelly in an adaptation by April De Angelis of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

According to the website of Italian symphonic metal band Rhapsody of Fire (previously known as Rhapsody), York had been recruited for a narrated part on the band&#x27;s next full-length album &quot;Triumph or Agony&quot;. In 2009, she starred alongside Jos Vantyler in the Tennessee Williams season at the New End Theatre, London for which she received critical acclaim.

York&#x27;s last stage performance was as Jean in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s &quot;Quartet&quot;, at the Oxford Playhouse in August 2010.

===Writing and personal appearances===
In the 1970s, York wrote two children&#x27;s fantasy novels, &quot;In Search of Unicorns&quot; (1973, revised 1984) which was excerpted in the film &quot;Images&quot;, and &quot;Lark&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1976, revised 1986).

She was a guest, along with David Puttnam on the BBC Radio 4 documentary &quot;I Had The Misery Thursday&quot;, a tribute programme to film actor Montgomery Clift, which was aired in 1986, on the 20th anniversary of Clift&#x27;s death. York had co-starred with him in &quot;Freud: The Secret Passion&quot;, John Huston&#x27;s 1962 film biography of the psychoanalyst.

==Personal life==
In 1959, York married Michael Wells, with whom she had two children: daughter Sasha (born May 1972), and son Orlando (born June 1973). They divorced in 1976. In the 1984 TV adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, she played Mrs. Cratchit and both of her children co-starred as Cratchit offspring. York&#x27;s first grandchild by way of Orlando was born in 2007.

Politically, York was left-leaning, and publicly supported Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli dissident who revealed Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme. While performing &quot;The Loves of Shakespeare&#x27;s Women&quot; at the Cameri Theatre in Tel Aviv in June 2007, York dedicated the performance to Vanunu, evoking both cheers and jeers from the audience.

==Death==
Diagnosed with cancer late in 2010, York refused chemotherapy and honoured a contractual obligation to appear in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s &quot;Quartet&quot;. She died at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London from multiple myeloma on 15 January 2011, aged 72.

<text>The Airspeed AS.57 Ambassador is a British twin piston-engined airliner that was designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Airspeed Ltd. It was one of the first postwar airliners to be produced.

The Ambassador was developed in response to a requirement identified by the Brabazon Committee for a twin-engined short-to-medium-haul airliner as a replacement for the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3. Airspeed assembled a dispersed design team at Fairmile Manor, Cobham, Surrey, in 1943, which initially worked on a smaller proposal powered by Bristol Hercules radial engines; this was quickly superseded by a larger-capacity design aimed at better fulfilling the expansion in postwar civil air travel, although several entities doubted Airspeed&#x27;s projected growth in air travel. Fitted with the new but conventional Bristol Centaurus radial engines, the Ambassador was designed to accommodate four Napier Nomad turbo-compound engines, a then-recent innovation. Its fuselage was compatible with pressurisation, this being an optional feature offered to customers.

On 10 July 1947, the first prototype Ambassador conducted its maiden flight at Christchurch with chief test pilot George Errington at the controls; a total of three prototypes were built. Early on, British European Airways (BEA) emerged as a key customer for the type, having placed a £3 million order for 20 aircraft in September 1948. Introducing the Ambassador to service in 1951, BEA often referred to the aircraft as the &quot;Elizabethans&quot;, as the aircraft were used for the airline&#x27;s &quot;Elizabethan Class&quot; passenger service. However, the type was quickly outperformed by the turboprop-powered Vickers Viscount, with BEA opting to withdraw its Ambassadors in 1958.

Secondhand aircraft were operated by several other airlines, including Dan-Air and Northeast Airlines. Despite being produced in relatively small numbers, the Ambassador was operational for longer than had been anticipated by planners.

==Development==
===Background===
The origins of the Ambassador can be traced to 1943 and the work of the Brabazon Committee, which sought to define what types of aircraft would be desired by the postwar civil aviation sector. One of the committee&#x27;s recommendations was a twin-engined short-to-medium-haul replacement for the Douglas DC-3, known as the &quot;Type 2&quot;. The British manufacturer Airspeed Ltd. was interested in this requirement and established a small design team to work on the project from a dispersed office in Fairmile Manor at Cobham in Surrey in 1943. This effort was headed by ex-de Havilland aeronautical engineer Arthur Hagg, who had joined the company earlier that year.

Early concepts included an unpressurised aircraft in the 14.5-ton gross weight class to be powered by a pair of Bristol Hercules radial engines. Work on the endeavour was taken as far as possible without impacting Airspeed&#x27;s wartime production activity, as the Second World War was still raging. In response to changes in planner&#x27;s preferences, dictating that the interim aircraft be procured so that airliners such as the in-development Ambassador had more development time, thus the design was revised substantially to expand its capacity. By 1944, it was a considerably larger design than the DC-3, with improved comfort and space.

While Airspeed&#x27;s management believed that postwar demands would demand greater passenger capacities, several figures, including those within the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and the Air Ministry, were less enthusiastic with their projections. The company also promoted the economics of higher utilisation rates and elevated cruise speeds, whereas conventional wisdom amongst airlines was to avoid increasing speeds to reduce fuel consumption. For the Ambassador, Airspeed opted to pursue a cruising altitude of 20,000 ft, relatively high for the era. A comprehensive mockup was completed by November 1944, largely for promotional purposes, while the projected operating cost figures were released during early 1945.

Immediately following the end of the conflict, the British Ministry of Aircraft Production placed an order with the company to produce a pair of prototypes. While the first prototype was to be unpressurised and powered by a pair of Bristol Centaurus radial engines, it was envisioned that the second prototype would feature a reinforced fuselage compatible with pressurisation and a wing that could accommodate four Napier Nomad turbo-compound engines. Several officials, including company chairman Alan Samuel Butler, favored the adoption of the new turbopropeller engines. By the end of 1945, work had commenced on building structural test sections and jigs.

===Into flight===
On 10 July 1947, the first prototype, registered &quot;G-AGUA&quot;, conducted the type&#x27;s maiden flight, flown by chief test pilot George B.S. Errington. After the generally successful first flight, the prototype underwent a month of alterations, including deleting the spring tab and replacing it with geared tabs fitted to the outer rudders and locking the inner rudder; reversible propellers were also installed. During September 1947, the prototype made its first public display alongside elements of the second prototype, including its cockpit and control system, at the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) show at Radlett.

On 22 November 1947, the programme received a setback when the prototype was forced to perform a belly landing after the port undercarriage leg failed to deploy due to a loss of hydraulic pressure. This did not seemingly deter customer confidence, as the newly created operator British European Airways (BEA) continued to openly express their preference for the type, and in September they placed a £3 million order for 20 Ambassadors. This support was so impactful that, according to aviation author H. A. Taylor, rival aircraft manufacturer Vickers was close to cancelling development of the Viscount over fears that airlines held a preference for advanced piston-powered airliners over the unfamiliar turboprop.

During flight testing, it was found that the aircraft possessed particularly favourable low speed characteristics. Having been explored in depth beforehand, this was dramatically displayed at the 1948 Farnborough Airshow, becoming the only aircraft in history to perform such an aerial display with one engine out throughout. This was a deliberate choice, with the inactive engine&#x27;s propeller being feathered prior to taking off and remaining so until after landing. The first prototype performed the majority of flight testing through late 1948.

A total of three prototypes were constructed for the test programme. The second Ambassador, &quot;G-AKRD&quot;, was the first to feature pressurisation and was equipped with a full passenger cabin configuration for demonstration flights. This second prototype was subsequently used by the Bristol Aeroplane Company from 1953 for flight-testing the Bristol Proteus 705 turbine engine. From March 1958, it was used by Rolls-Royce for testing the Dart and Tyne turboprops. The third prototype and first Ambassador 2 &quot;G-ALFR&quot; was initially used for BEA proving trials, and in 1955 it also supported the development trials of the Napier Eland turbine engine. During 1958, intensive simulated airline flying, to pave the way for BEA Vanguards, was performed using two Tyne-powered Ambassadors.

During the latter stage of development, some issues were uncovered. The wing, which had been designed to induce laminar flow characteristics, was relatively unconventional in its design; testing revealed that it lacked sufficient strength, and redesigning the wing was not straightforward. Technical assistance was provided by de Havilland and the issue was proven to be resolved in December 1949. Three minor accidents during demonstration flights, while causing no serious damage, often delayed testing and did not inspire confidence amongst potential customers. Quantity production of the Ambassador commenced during 1950, leading to the first production standard aircraft, destined for BEA, performing its first flight on 12 January 1951.

==Design==
The Airspeed Ambassador was an all-metal twin-engine airliner, designed to serve short-to-medium haul routes. It was relatively advanced for the era, being relatively aerodynamically clean, having a high aspect–ratio wing with hoped-for near-Laminar flow characteristics, a tricycle undercarriage, a steerable nosewheel, integral fuel tanks, and other recent innovations. Distinctive external features of the Ambassador included its three low tailfins and a long pointed nose, giving it a resemblance to the larger transcontinental Lockheed Constellation. Its tricycle gear gave it a more modern appearance than contemporaries such as the DC-3, Curtiss Commando, Avro Lancastrian and Vickers Vikings that were common on Europe&#x27;s shorter airline routes.

In a standard configuration, the Ambassador could accommodate up to 47 passengers; somewhat unusually, its passenger cabin could be either pressurised or not as the customer preferred. To reduce cabin noise levels, considerable effort went into soundproofing and general furnishings; Taylor described the Ambassador as being particularly quiet for a piston engine airliner, although also noting it could not equal the lower noise levels of turboprop-powered airliners such as the Vickers Viscount. It was typically powered by conventional Bristol Centaurus radial engines, although individual aircraft were reengined with various powerplants, including turboprops.

To increase cruise performance, designers made great efforts to minimise drag, using a NACA laminar-flow wing section. The predicted low-drag performance was not completely realized, however, due to structural features for wing construction, propeller slipstream over the inner wing, and increased skin roughness in actual service conditions. The engine nacelles were initially designed with inwardly-opening louvres for exhaust gases and cooling air rather than the usual outwardly opening &quot;gills&quot;. However, these proved inadequate for cooling the engine, thus the gills were reinstated. Engine-out climb performance was enhanced by being able to feather the propeller using a zero-torque signal from the engine.

==Operational history==
During 1952, British European Airways (BEA) introduced the first of its 20 strong fleet of Ambassadors to revenue service, the airline referred to them as the &quot;Elizabethan Class&quot; in honour of the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II. The planned 1951 introduction date had been pushed to 1952 to address development issues. By May 1951, intense proving trials of the Ambassador were being conducted by a joint team of Airspeed and BEA employees, while official BEA training commenced in August of that year. The flagship of BEA&#x27;s fleet was &quot;G-ALZN&quot;, appropriately named &quot;RMA Elizabethan&quot;. The first &quot;Elizabethan&quot; scheduled flight was from Heathrow Airport to Paris Le Bourget on 13 March 1952, soon the type was used across BEA&#x27;s main UK routes.

According to Taylor, the Ambassador&#x27;s performance gave BEA a competitive edge over its rivals. By December 1955, the &quot;Elizabethan Class&quot; had reached 2,230 flying hours annually, per aircraft, the highest in BEA&#x27;s fleet. However, the rival Vickers Viscount, which was introduced in 1953, was even more popular with BEA&#x27;s passengers than the Ambassador. Rival airlines, such as Air France, had also quickly introduced the Viscount, and thus held an advantage over BEA&#x27;s Elizabethan service. Accordingly, the airline decided to withdraw the type despite its relative youth, with BEA&#x27;s final scheduled Ambassador flight on 30 July 1958.

There were no further sales of the Ambassador. Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Masefield laid this lack of success largely upon attitudes within de Havilland&#x27;s management following its takeover of Airspeed in 1951; they allegedly preferred to use Airspeed&#x27;s factory at Christchurch Airfield to produce military jets designed by de Havilland. One example of de Havilland&#x27;s undermining of potential sales was the recall of the Sales Director to de Havilland&#x27;s headquarters at Hatfield Aerodrome (Hertfordshire, England) from Australia, despite his reportedly being near to finalizing an order from Trans-Australia Airlines for 12 Ambassadors. Taylor observed that prospective customers were often sceptical that Airspeed, being a relatively small company, could be relied upon for technical support and components.
Following the type&#x27;s disposal by BEA, secondhand Ambassadors helped to establish the scheduled and charter flight operations of Dan-Air, an important airline in the development of the package holiday. The type was also used in the UK by Autair and BKS Air Transport. Secondhand Ambassadors were also flown for short periods by other airlines including Butler Air Transport (Australia), Globe Air (Switzerland) and Norrønafly (Norway). Multiple entities, such as Royal Dutch Shell and the Royal Jordanian Air Force, also procured Ambassadors for private purposes.

The initial popularity of the Ambassador, with its pressurised cabin and good soundproofing, was soon eclipsed by the arrival of turboprop-powered aircraft such as the Vickers Viscount and, some years later, the Lockheed Electra, which featured more reliable engines and faster speeds.

==Variants==

;AS.57 Ambassador 1
:Prototype aircraft with Bristol Centaurus 130 engines, two built.
;AS.57 Ambassador 2
:Production version with Bristol Centaurus 661 engines, 21 built including the production prototype.

===Projects===
;AS.59 Ambassador II
:Project for either a twin-engined variant with Bristol Proteus or Bristol Theseus engines or a four-engined variant with Napier Naiads or Rolls-Royce Darts. From the first prototypes, the Ambassador&#x27;s wing had been stressed for four Naiad turboprops, but no four-engined variant flew.
;AS.60 Ayrshire C.1
:Proposed variant to meet Air Ministry Specification C.13/45 for a medium-range military transport with a rear-fuselage loading ramp. Ten were ordered in October 1946 but were not built, after a review of the design&#x27;s projected performance produced figures lower than the Air Ministry&#x27;s requirements.
;AS.64

==Accidents and incidents==
* 8 April 1955: &quot;G-AMAB&quot;, &quot;Sir Francis Bacon&quot; of British European Airways was damaged beyond repair in a forced landing south-west of Düsseldorf, Germany. This aircraft had often been used by the Queen and Prince Philip when travelling to Europe in the early 1950s.
* 6 February 1958: &quot;G-ALZU&quot;, &quot;Lord Burghley&quot;, also of BEA, in what became known as the Munich air disaster, crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop at Munich while operating a charter flight from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to Manchester, England. This crash received tremendous public attention in the UK as it involved team members and staff of Manchester United Football Club, together with representatives of the national press. Of the 44 people on the plane, 21 died in the crash and 2 died later, including eight Manchester United players. The investigation eventually focused on runway slush adversely affecting the speed of the plane as it attempted to take off.
* 14 April 1966: &quot;G-ALZX&quot; of Dan-Air was damaged beyond repair when its undercarriage collapsed on landing at Beauvais, France.
* 14 September 1967 &quot;G-ALZS&quot; of Autair was damaged beyond repair on landing at Luton Airport, UK. The aircraft overran the runway and ended up in soft clay.
* 3 July 1968: &quot;G-AMAD&quot; of BKS Air Transport crashed at London Heathrow Airport. All but two of its crew as well as several horses which were being transported and their grooms, were killed. A parked Trident airliner was damaged beyond repair (&quot;G-ARPT&quot;) and another Trident had its tail torn off before the airliner hit terminal buildings and came to rest. The accident was caused by a failed flap actuating rod in the left wing. The Trident which suffered the damaged tail (&quot;G-ARPI&quot;) was subsequently repaired and later involved in an unconnected fatal accident in June 1972.
* 30 September 1968: &quot;G-AMAG&quot; of Dan-Air was damaged beyond repair in a wheels-up landing at Manston, United Kingdom.

<doc id="217680" wikidata="Q5289831" url="?curid=217680" title="Domain relational calculus">
<text>In computer science, domain relational calculus (DRC) is a calculus that was introduced by Michel Lacroix and Alain Pirotte as a declarative database query language for the relational data model.

In DRC, &quot;queries&quot; have the form:

:formula_1

where each Xi is either a domain variable or constant, and formula_2 denotes a DRC &quot;formula&quot;. The result of the query is the set of tuples X1 to Xn that make the DRC formula true.

This language uses the same operators as tuple calculus,
the logical connectives ∧ (and), ∨ (or) and ¬ (not). The existential quantifier (∃) and the universal quantifier (∀) can be used to bind the variables.

Its computational expressiveness is equivalent to that of relational algebra.

==Examples==
Let (A, B, C) mean (Rank, Name, ID) in the Enterprise relation

and let (D, E, F) mean (Name, DeptName, ID) in the Department relation

All captains of the starship USS Enterprise:
formula_3

In this example, A, B, C denotes both the result set and a set in the table Enterprise.

Names of Enterprise crew members who are in Stellar Cartography:
formula_4

In this example, we&#x27;re only looking for the name, and that&#x27;s B. The condition F = C is a requirement that describes the intersection of Enterprise crew members AND members of the Stellar Cartography Department.

An alternate representation of the previous example would be:
formula_5

In this example, the value of the requested F domain is directly placed in the formula and the C domain variable is re-used in the query for the existence of a department, since it already holds a crew member&#x27;s ID.

Both of them written in SQL will be like:
SELECT B
FROM Enterprise
JOIN Department
 ON F = C
 AND E = &#x27;Stellar Cartography&#x27;;

<doc id="217682" wikidata="Q157103" url="?curid=217682" title="Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans">
<text>Ferdinand IV (8 September 1633 – 9 July 1654) was made and crowned King of Bohemia in 1646, King of Hungary and Croatia in 1647, and King of the Romans on 31 May 1653. He also served as Duke of Cieszyn.

== Early life ==
Born in Vienna on 8 September 1633, and baptised as &quot;Ferdinand Franz&quot;, Ferdinand IV was the eldest son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. 

== Biography ==
At a young age, Ferdinand IV took his father&#x27;s place as Archduke of Austria. In 1646, Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia, sharing the role and that of Duke of Cieszyn with his father Emperor Ferdinand III. He was crowned on 5 August 1646. Ferdinand IV also shared the role of King of Hungary and Croatia with his father; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg, present-day Slovakia.

After the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans, Emperor Ferdinand III took advantage of a recent decline in the prestige of France, and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans, and &quot;de facto&quot; heir to the Holy Roman Empire in the 1653 imperial election. He was crowned in Ratisbon (Regensburg, present-day south-east Germany) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653. However, Ferdinand IV unexpectedly died of smallpox in Vienna on 9 July 1654. Prior to his death, it was planned that he would marry Philip IV of Spain&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa of Spain, his cousin. Upon the death of Ferdinand III, Leopold was elected as Holy Roman Emperor.

<text>Dyan Cannon (born Samille Diane Friesen; January 4, 1937) is an American actress, filmmaker and editor. Her accolades include a Saturn Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Academy Award nominations and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was named Female Star of the Year by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 1973 and the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Press Club in 1979.

A former beauty queen who held the title of Miss West Seattle, Cannon made her television debut in 1958. Over the next decade, she became a common sight on episodic shows while appearing occasionally on Broadway and in B-movies. In 1969, she had her breakthrough film role in the sex comedy &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Cannon was nominated in that category again for &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), earning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her lead role in &quot;Such Good Friends&quot; (1971). She also was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film as the producer of &quot;Number One&quot; (1976).

Other films in which Cannon has performed include &quot;The Love Machine&quot; (1971), &quot;Shamus&quot; (1973), &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973), &quot;Child Under a Leaf&quot; (1974), &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; (1978), &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (1980), &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (1980), &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1982), &quot;Author!

Cannon made her feature directorial debut with 1990&#x27;s semi-autobiographical drama &quot;The End of Innocence&quot;, which she also wrote and starred in. From 1997 to 2000 she played a recurring role on the legal series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;.

Before her career took off, Cannon was married to Cary Grant for three years and gave birth to his only child, daughter Jennifer. Reluctant to discuss the marriage since their 1968 divorce, Cannon initially turned down publishing deals following Grant&#x27;s death in 1986. Her memoir &quot;Dear Cary&quot; was published in 2011 and became a New York Times Best Seller. In 2023, the book was adapted into a miniseries called &quot;Archie&quot; with Cannon executive producing.

==Early life==
Cannon was born Samille Diane Friesen in Tacoma, Washington, on January 4, 1937, the daughter of housewife Claire (née Portnoy) and life insurance salesman Ben Friesen. She was raised in the Jewish faith of her mother, who was an immigrant from Ukraine; her father was an Anabaptist of Canadian Mennonite ancestry. Her younger brother is jazz musician David Friesen. Cannon attended West Seattle High School and was crowned Miss West Seattle in 1954. She spent two and a half semesters at the University of Washington, majoring in anthropology.

In 1956, Cannon dropped out of college and went to live with her aunt Sally in Phoenix, Arizona, where she took a job at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Courted by nightclub owner Sonny Orling, then 32, she got engaged and followed him to Beverly Hills, California. They soon parted, but she decided to stay in the area and enroll at UCLA. A part-time modeling job led to an interview with producer Jerry Wald, who suggested she change her last name to Cannon. She signed to MGM, doing promotional work for the film &quot;Les Girls&quot;, and studied with acting teacher Sanford Meisner.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Cannon made her film debut in 1960 in &quot;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&quot;; she had appeared on television since the late 1950s, including a guest appearance on &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; as Mary Lowery in the 1959 episode &quot;Lady Luck&quot; and again in a 1961 episode as Diane Jansen in &quot;The Price of Paradise&quot;. She appeared in 1959 on CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, in episode 52, &quot;Vanishing Act&quot;, as Nicole McCready. About this time, she was on the CBS western &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, starring Don Durant, and on Jack Lord&#x27;s western &quot;Stoney Burke&quot; on ABC. She also appeared on &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; in 1961, opposite Tracey Steele, Robert Conrad, and Connie Stevens.

In 1962, Cannon acted on Broadway with Jane Fonda and Bradford Dillman in &quot;The Fun Couple&quot;. Next came the national touring company of the musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, in which she played Rosemary.

In 1964 she guest-starred on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing Ivy Norton, an abused daughter looking to marry the man she loves in the episode &quot;Aunt Thede&quot;. She portrayed Mona Elliott in the episode &quot;The Man Behind the Man&quot; of the 1964 CBS drama series &quot;The Reporter&quot; and had a regular role on the short-lived daytime soap opera &quot;Full Circle&quot;. Cannon also made guest appearances on &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, the 1960 episode &quot;Sheriff of the Town&quot; of the first-run syndicated western series &quot;Two Faces West&quot; with Walter Coy as Cauter and the 1962 &quot;Ripcord&quot; episode &quot;The Helicopter Race&quot; as Ripcord Inc.&#x27;s secretary and receptionist Marion Hines. She landed another role in a feature with &quot;The Murder Game&quot; (1965), then took four years off.

===Stardom===

Cannon&#x27;s first major film role came in 1969&#x27;s &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;, which earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. In 1971 she starred in four films: &quot;The Love Machine&quot;, from the novel by Jacqueline Susann; &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; with Sean Connery and Christopher Walken; &quot;The Burglars&quot; with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Omar Sharif; and Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Her name was used to market a fifth release that year, &quot;Doctors&#x27; Wives&quot;, in which she had top billing despite only making a cameo appearance.

Cannon was slated to appear in &quot;The Traveling Executioner&quot; (1970) and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1973), but bowed out and was replaced by Marianna Hill and Samantha Eggar, respectively.

In 1973, Cannon starred opposite Burt Reynolds in &quot;Shamus&quot; and played an agent based on Sue Mengers in &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;, and was named Actress of the Year by the National Association of Theatre Owners. In 1974, she gave a critically acclaimed performance in &quot;Child Under a Leaf&quot; and starred in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Virginia Hill&quot; with Harvey Keitel. Following this she took a four-year absence from acting in feature films. Among the offers she turned down was Jacqueline Bisset&#x27;s role in &quot;St. Ives&quot; (1976).

Cannon starred in her own musical stage act at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas and Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe during the mid-1970s. She then enrolled in the Women&#x27;s Directing Workshop of the American Film Institute. She became the first Oscar-nominated actress to be nominated in the Best Short Film, Live Action category for &quot;Number One&quot; (1976), a project which Cannon produced, directed, wrote and edited. It was a story about adolescent sexual curiosity. In 1978, Cannon co-starred in &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;. That same year, she appeared in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, for which she received another Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Cannon hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during its first season and guest-starred in the fourth season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. She co-starred with then-boyfriend Armand Assante in the TV movie &quot;Lady of the House&quot; (1978), a dramatization of the life of Sally Stanford. In 1979, the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Press Club voted Cannon as Female Star of the Year.

In the early 1980s, Cannon, who is also a singer/songwriter, appeared in &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (1980) with Willie Nelson, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (1980) with Robert Blake, &quot;Author! Author!&quot; (1982) with Al Pacino, and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1982) with Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve. She starred in the TV movie &quot;Having It All&quot; (1982) as well as a miniseries, &quot;Master of the Game&quot; (1984), then had the title role in &quot;Jenny&#x27;s War&quot; (1985). After making &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Mom&quot; (1988) for Disney, she appeared with an ensemble cast in &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988). In addition, she co-wrote the title track for Chaka Khan&#x27;s album, &quot;The Woman I Am&quot;, with Brenda Russell.

For her contributions to the film industry, Cannon was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983 with a motion pictures star located at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Later work===
Cannon wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-autobiographical film &quot;The End of Innocence&quot; (1990). She subsequently appeared opposite Phylicia Rashad in &quot;Jailbirds&quot; (1991) and Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis in &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot; (1992), the latter of which was directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, before reuniting with &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; director Paul Mazursky for &quot;The Pickle&quot; (1993), alongside Danny Aiello.

Cannon had guest roles on the popular television shows &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot;, as well as being a semi-regular on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. In 1997 she could be seen in three major studio film releases: &quot;8 Heads in a Duffel Bag&quot; with Joe Pesci; a remake of &quot;That Darn Cat&quot;; and &quot;Out to Sea&quot; with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Also that year, she worked with Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV movie &quot;Beverly Hills Family Robinson&quot;. In 2001 and 2002, she had a regular part in the TV series &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Cannon and Christopher Walken were reunited for &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; (2003), but her performance was cut down to a walk-on in the final version of the film.

In 2005, she appeared in &quot;Boynton Beach Club&quot;, a movie about aging Floridians who have just lost their spouses; Cannon&#x27;s real-life ex Michael Nouri played her love interest. Her later roles included &quot;A Kiss at Midnight&quot; (2008) for Hallmark and the unaired pilot &quot;Women Without Men&quot; (2010) with Lorraine Bracco and Penny Marshall. She wrote and directed another short, &quot;Unleashed&quot; (2010). Cannon returned to the stage to star in a 2013 production of Ken Ludwig&#x27;s &quot;The Fox on the Fairway&quot; in Overland Park, Kansas. After a hiatus from the screen, she acted in the equestrian themed family film &quot;Hope&#x27;s Legacy&quot; (2021). Forgoing its scheduled opening at Baltimore&#x27;s Senator Theatre due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was instead released to streaming platforms.

Cannon published a bestselling memoir, &quot;Dear Cary: My Life with Cary Grant&quot;, in 2011. She had previously been approached by Swifty Lazar to write about her late ex-husband in 1986, turning down &quot;millions,&quot; and declined another publishing offer some years later from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, stating that there was still healing that needed to happen. Cannon serves as executive producer of a four-part miniseries based on her book, entitled &quot;Archie&quot;, which premiered on BritBox in 2023 and stars Jason Isaacs as Grant and Laura Aikman as Cannon.

==Personal life==
In 1961, Cannon began dating actor Cary Grant, who was 33 years her senior. They married on July 22, 1965, and had one daughter, Jennifer (b. February 26, 1966). Cannon filed for divorce in September 1967, and it was concluded on March 21, 1968.

Cannon married a second time on April 18, 1985, to lawyer-turned-real estate investor Stanley Fimberg. They divorced in 1991. In 2024, Cannon said she and Fimberg are still friends.

Cannon has also been in relationships with comedian Mort Sahl, talent agent Ron Weisner and sculptor Carl Hartman, as well as producers Murray Shostak and Leonard Rabinowitz, directors Hal Ashby and Jerry Schatzberg, and actors Armand Assante, Hy Chase, Ron Ely and Michael Nouri. She remains friendly with Nouri and accompanied him to a premiere four decades after their breakup.

Cannon has often collaborated with her significant others on film and TV projects. Shostak and Rabinowitz produced her starring vehicles &quot;Child Under a Leaf&quot; and &quot;The End of Innocence&quot; respectively; Schatzberg directed her in &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;; Assante and Nouri were her leading men in &quot;Lady of the House&quot; and &quot;Boynton Beach Club&quot; respectively; and she guest-starred on Ely&#x27;s series &quot;Malibu Run&quot;.

In 1972, Cannon revealed that she engaged in primal therapy. She also dabbled in metaphysics and got kicked out of Esalen.

A longtime fixture at Los Angeles Lakers games, she is considered the team&#x27;s second-most-famous fan behind Jack Nicholson.

She is a born-again Christian.

==Philanthropy==
Cannon&#x27;s experience as a single mother led to her becoming national spokeswoman for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, which provides emotional support and companionship for children of one-parent homes. She paid for the tombstone of slain runaway Alyssa Margie &quot;Raven&quot; Gomez, whom she&#x27;d met while making a documentary about homelessness. Cannon has used her celebrity to benefit other charitable organizations, such as Special Olympics, for mentally and physically disabled athletes. For 12 years, she hosted God&#x27;s Party, a bi-weekly Bible study held at Radford Studio Center.

<doc id="217686" wikidata="Q467409" url="?curid=217686" title="Tommy Morrison">
<text>Tommy Morrison (January 2, 1969 – September 1, 2013) was an American professional boxer and mixed martial artist who competed from 1988 to 2009. Best known for his left hook and formidable punching power, Morrison won the WBO heavyweight title in 1993 with a unanimous decision victory over George Foreman. He lost the title in his second defense to Michael Bentt that same year. Morrison&#x27;s other boxing highlights include his fight with Ray Mercer in 1991. In 1995, he won the minor IBC heavyweight title when he defeated Donovan Ruddock by technical knockout (TKO). He retired from boxing in 1996 after testing positive for HIV. Morrison is also known for his acting career, having starred alongside Sylvester Stallone in the 1990 film &quot;Rocky V&quot; as Tommy Gunn.

Morrison made a brief comeback to boxing from 2007 to 2008 when the Nevada commission lifted the indefinite worldwide suspension in July 2006, and briefly dabbled in the world of MMA. As a mixed martial artist, he scored a notable first-round knockout win over Wyoming state heavyweight champion Corey Williams in 2009, which ultimately became the last fight Morrison ever had in combat sports before his final retirement due to his declining health that began in 2011.

On September 1, 2013, Morrison died at the age of 44 from sepsis, septic shock, multi-system organ failure and, ultimately, cardiac arrest.

==Early life and amateur career==
Morrison was born in Gravette, Arkansas. His mother, Diana, was Native American (half Ponca and half Otoe) and his father Tim was of Scottish ancestry. Morrison was raised in Delaware County, Oklahoma, spending most of his teenage years in Jay. His nickname, &quot;The Duke&quot;, is based on the claim that he was a grand-nephew (or otherwise distant relative) of the Hollywood star John Wayne (né Marion Morrison), nicknamed &quot;Duke&quot;. Tommy&#x27;s father urged him to take up boxing in the 1970s. When Tommy was 15 years old, his mother used a fake ID and entered her son into a &quot;toughman&quot; contest (the minimum age for contestants was 18). He later told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he lost only one of these matches.

After graduating from high school in 1988, Morrison received a football scholarship to Emporia State University. In the same year, Morrison won the Regional Heavyweight Title – Kansas City Golden Gloves from Donald Ellis and advanced to the National Golden Gloves in Omaha, Nebraska, where he decisioned Javier Alvarez in the preliminaries, decisioned Warren Williams in the quarterfinals, but lost a split decision to Derek Isaman in the semifinals. Two weeks later, Morrison took part in the Western Olympic trials in Houston, Texas, defeating Robert Hargrove by a 4–1 majority decision in the semifinals, and John Bray by a 5–0 unanimous decision in the finals, and qualifying for the nationals, and garnering the &quot;Outstanding Fighter&quot; award of the tournament. Two weeks after that, fighting out of Republic, Missouri, at the National Olympic Trials in Concord, California, July 6, 1988, Morrison lost a 0–5 unanimous decision to Ray Mercer, who went on to win the gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. (They also had a prior match-up scheduled to be held June 16, 1988, at the Felt Forum, New York City, but it is not known why it did not take place.)

As an amateur, Morrison claimed 222 fights (most of which were local match-ups), with the 1988 Olympic Trials being the top of his amateur career. His amateur record is 202 wins, 20 losses.

==Professional career==
=== Early career ===
Morrison started his professional boxing career on November 10, 1988, with a first-round knockout of William Muhammad in New York City. Three weeks later, he scored another first-round knockout. In 1989, Morrison had 19 wins and 0 losses, 15 by knockout. That same year, actor Sylvester Stallone, after watching one of Morrison&#x27;s bouts, arranged a script reading, and cast Morrison in the movie &quot;Rocky V&quot; as Tommy &quot;The Machine&quot; Gunn, a young and talented protege of the retired Rocky Balboa. Morrison took a six-month break from boxing to work on the movie in 1990. From December 8, 1989, until June 8, 1990, Morrison did not compete in a boxing match, due both to injuries and his involvement in &quot;Rocky V&quot;. In 1991, Morrison won four bouts, including notable victories against opponents James Tillis, the first man to take Mike Tyson the distance, and former WBC heavyweight champion Pinklon Thomas.

==== Morrison vs. Mercer ====
Morrison was then given an opportunity to face fellow undefeated fighter Ray Mercer, the WBO title holder in a Pay Per View card held on October 18, 1991. The fight was a matchup between two undefeated, up-and-coming heavyweights. The bout had been scheduled for August 9, but Morrison withdrew due to an injury.

Morrison got off to a great start, outboxing a sluggish Mercer through the first three rounds en route to taking all three rounds on all three of the judge&#x27;s scorecards. Mercer would end the fight only 28 seconds into the fifth round. With Morrison backed up into the corner, Mercer was able to land a 15–punch combination. Clearly hurt from the exchange, Morrison slumped against the ropes, but the referee allowed Mercer to land several more punishing blows to a now defenseless Morrison before finally ending the fight. Morrison suffered the first loss of his career, losing by 5th-round knockout.

=== Career from 1991–1993 ===
He had six wins in 1992, including fights with Art Tucker and Joe Hipp, who later became the first Native American to challenge for the world heavyweight title. In the Hipp fight, held June 19, 1992, Morrison was suffering from what was later discovered to be a broken hand and broken jaw, but rallied to score a knockout in the ninth round.

=== WBO heavyweight champion ===

==== Morrison vs. Foreman ====
After two wins in 1993, including one over two-time world title challenger Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams, Morrison found himself fighting for the WBO title again, against heavyweight boxing legend George Foreman. Though the bout was promoted as a match between two of boxing&#x27;s hardest punchers, neither fighter scored a knockdown nor had their opponent in any real danger. Morrison chose to avoid brawling with Foreman and spent the fight boxing from long range. He was able to hit and move effectively in this manner. Morrison won the bout in a lopsided unanimous decision with two scores of 117–110 and one score of 118–109, which resulted in him becoming the new WBO Heavyweight champion in the process.

==== Morrison vs. Tomashek ====

Originally, Morrison&#x27;s first title defense was scheduled against his Rocky V co-star Mike Williams in August 1993. Williams ultimately withdrew on the night of the fight, so Tim Tomashek stood in as a replacement. Tomashek had been selected as an alternate. Tomashek had been drinking before the bout, not believing Williams to have really backed out. Though Tomashek gave a good account of himself, reeling off a combination en route to winning the first round on the judges cards, Morrison fought conservatively but dropped his opponent with a multi-punch combination, and the fight was stopped by Tomashek&#x27;s corner after only four rounds due to him walking to the wrong corner after his brutal punishment by Morrison. The WBO was later said to have rescinded their sanctioning of this fight due to Tomashek&#x27;s lack of experience, but this was later confirmed to have been a rumor as fight records show the fight remained a bonafide title bout.

==== Morrison vs. Bentt ====
Almost immediately, talks of a fight with WBC champion Lennox Lewis began for reestablishing him as one of the top heavyweight contenders. Morrison then agreed to the lucrative WBC title shot against Lewis, that would see Lewis make the fourth defense of his title against Morrison, with both men evenly splitting a $16 million purse. However, Morrison first chose to take a tuneup bout against the virtually unknown Michael Bentt before facing Lewis. The decision would prove to be unwise as Bentt brutalized Morrison during their fight, knocking him down three times 97 seconds into the first round in front of a live HBO Boxing audience, after which the fight was stopped and Bentt was named the winner. The loss cost Morrison his title shot against Lewis, as well as a reported $7.5 million that he was to earn in the Lewis fight.

=== Career from 1994–1996 ===
Morrison recovered by winning three bouts in a row in 1994, but his last fight of the year, against Ross Puritty, ended with a draw, before he landed a WBO heavyweight title fight against Herbie Hide on the infamous &quot;High Noon in Hong Kong&quot; card, but the event was cancelled at the last minute due to financial issues. Morrison won three fights in 1995 before meeting former #1 contender Razor Ruddock for the minor IBC heavyweight title.

==== Morrison vs. Ruddock ====
Ruddock dropped Morrison to his knees in the first round, but Morrison recovered to force a standing count in round two and compete on even terms for five rounds. Both fighters continued to trade power punches in rounds three and four, but Ruddock took control in round five, hurting Morrison with several left hooks and keeping him at bay with his jab. In the sixth round, Ruddock hurt Morrison with a quick combination, but just as it seemed Morrison was in trouble, he countered with a tremendous hook that put Ruddock on the canvas. Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.

==== Morrison vs. Lewis ====
Following his victory over Ruddock, Morrison was scheduled to meet former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Riddick Bowe for Bowe&#x27;s WBO Heavyweight title, but Bowe pulled out after obtaining a more lucrative fight with Evander Holyfield. Shortly after the cancellation of the Bowe–Morrison fight, Lewis and Morrison were able to reach an agreement to face one another during the fall of 1995 in Atlantic City, New Jersey which would see Morrison defending the IBC belt he won from his fight with Ruddock. The much-anticipated fight with Lewis, who had also lost his world championship, was finally about to take place. In it, Morrison was knocked out in the sixth round. Both fighters fought a conservative first round with neither man establishing much power-wise, but Lewis was able to effectively and efficiently use his signature left-jab to keep Morrison on the defensive and had little trouble with Morrison from the second round onwards.

=== Retirement ===
In February 1996, in the hours before a scheduled bout against Arthur Weathers, the Nevada Athletic Commission determined that Morrison had tested positive for HIV, suspending Morrison from boxing in Nevada. Several days later, Morrison&#x27;s physician administered a test, which was also positive. At a news conference on February 15, 1996, Morrison said he had contracted HIV because of a &quot;permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle.&quot; Morrison stated that he would &quot;absolutely&quot; never fight again.

At another news conference on September 19, 1996, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Morrison announced he wished to fight &quot;one last time&quot; when he could find an opponent, the proceeds of which would benefit his KnockOut AIDS Foundation. A spokesman for the Oklahoma Professional Boxing Advisory Board said Morrison would probably not be permitted to fight in Oklahoma because of his Nevada suspension. Morrison was given an opportunity for a final bout. By invitation of George Foreman, Morrison traveled to Japan in November 1996, to fight on the undercard, headlined by Foreman himself of his title defense of his Lineal/WBU championship against Crawford Grimsley. Morrison was allowed to fight as anyone who was HIV positive was not prohibited from fighting in the boxing sport within Japan. However the bout was agreed to be stopped if Morrison received a cut. Morrison won against Marcus Rhode by TKO, at less than two minutes of the first round.

=== Comeback ===
In 2007, Morrison began fighting again having tested negative for HIV several times that year, after a decade away from the ring. After passing medical tests in Texas, West Virginia licensed Morrison to fight in that state, so in February of that year he fought and beat John Castle by a second round TKO, knocking him down in round two with his signature left hook.

==== Morrison vs Weisharr ====
In February 2008, Morrison was cleared to fight a young and undefeated fighter, Matt Weishaar, 3-0-2 (1 KO), in Leon, Mexico on the undercard of Marco Antonio Rubio vs. Jose Luis Zertuche. Morrison&#x27;s age and ring rust were very prominent in the bout, as he nearly stumbled over in round 2, but defended well and retained sharp powerful punches that shook his junior opponent. Weisharr took the first round on the cards with his jab keeping Tommy off the attack, but Morrison defeated Weisharr by third round TKO, after Weishaar was beginning to be overwhelmed by Morrison&#x27;s powerful punches and accurately placed blows to the head beginning in the third, leading to the ref waiving off the fight after a hard left hook and right cross.

==== Cancelled bouts in Texas and Montreal ====
Following his win over Castle, in April 2007, Morrison passed an additional medical test to be cleared to fight and licensed to fight in the state of Texas. He was scheduled to fight 28 year old Dale Ortiz (3-1) at Grand Plaza Hotel in Houston. Due to a paper work issue, not arriving before the date of the fight, Morrison was pulled from the event card.

In January 2011, the RACJ, the boxing commission for the province of Quebec, required that Morrison take a supervised HIV test in advance of a scheduled 2011 fight against Erik Barrak (3-0). Morrison invited the Quebec commission to attend a public test, but the commission did not come. Morrison stated that if Quebec refused to license him, he would &quot;take the dog and pony show somewhere else.&quot; Following this Tommy confirmed he was retired for good in an interview of August 2011 as he discussed his career and health.

== Mixed martial arts career ==
Morrison announced he would make his MMA debut after he began a comeback in his boxing career. Despite not intending to make a full career out of MMA, Morrison would be one of the few genuine examples of a former heavyweight boxing champion, alongside Ray Mercer, to dabble as a mixed martial artist to amount to any measure of success in the world of MMA.

On June 9, 2007, Morrison got into the cage with John Stover, a 340 pound fighter with a 7–2 record on the undercard fights of World Fighting Championships: Rumble in the Red Rocks. He did not need a license to fight as the location was outside the Arizona state jurisdiction, and Stover agreed to the match when it was shown to him that his opponent was allegedly HIV negative. Stover was under restrictions not able to knee, kick, or grapple, and bout was reduced to modified striking match, with boxing and elbows the only types remaining, and Muay Thai practices not involving the lower body remaining. After being pushed into the cage twice and some struggling with Stover throwing a number of ineffectual right hands and a left elbow, Morrison won in the first round by TKO after breaking Stover&#x27;s nose with an overhand right at just over two minutes into the round. Due to the modified stand-up rules, the fight was to be &quot;not considered a mixed martial arts contest,&quot; so instead was billed an exhibition fight and did not count towards Morrison&#x27;s professional MMA record.

Morrison fought a bout against professional Corey &quot;WizKid&quot; Williams as the main event of the Ultimate Explosion 12: The Last Stand MMA and Boxing fight card on January 31, 2009 for the Wyoming state heavyweight title. The bout was unsanctioned as the state of Wyoming did not possess an athletic commission at the time. As Williams utilized knees and boxing whilst Morrison clinched and boxed, he defeated his opponent by KO at one minute and fifty-eight seconds in the first round. The fight was sanctioned by the Warrior Rage Kickboxing Federation.

Morrison ended his brief career as a mixed martial artist with an official professional record of 1–0 (1 KO). In 2009, Morrison stated in an interview on MMANews.com that his debut in 2007 was more or less just a favor to his friend, who happened to be the promoter for the event, thus why his MMA career was short lived. He voiced respect for the sport and those that participated in it, but he decided to stick with boxing as it was what he knew best, stating he never did or ever intended to make a full transition despite popular belief.

== Personal life ==
At one point in 1996, Morrison was married to two women at the same time: Dawn Freeman and Dawn Gilbert. Morrison had two children by age 19. Tommy and Trisha Morrison were engaged in 2009 and married in 2011. Morrison is the father of professional boxers Trey Lippe Morrison and Kenzie Morrison.

=== Health ===
In 2006, Morrison said his HIV tests had been false positives. The Nevada commission&#x27;s medical advisory board reviewed Morrison&#x27;s 1996 test results and concluded they were &quot;ironclad and unequivocal.&quot; Morrison said he tried to get a copy of the original test result but was unable to do so, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it ever existed.&quot; The commission said Morrison could &quot;contact the laboratory, and they would immediately release the results to him.&quot;

Morrison tested negative for HIV four times in January 2007. On July 22, 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Morrison took two HIV tests in 2007 and a third specifically for the &quot;Times&quot;. Ringside doctors, including Nevada&#x27;s chief ringside physician, implied that the negative results were not based on Morrison&#x27;s blood.

===Legal issues===
In December 1993, Morrison was charged with assault and public intoxication when he allegedly punched a University of Iowa student. Morrison said that the student had been staring at him. Morrison pleaded guilty and paid a $310 fine, but said he was innocent. In October 1996, Morrison pleaded guilty to transporting a loaded firearm in Jay, Oklahoma; he received a 6-month suspended sentence and a $100 fine. In 1997, an Oklahoma jury convicted him of DUI in an accident that left three people injured; the court ordered Morrison to spend time in treatment.

In September 1999, an Oklahoma court gave a two-year suspended sentence for a DUI elevated to felony level by his previous DUI conviction. On September 16, 1999, the police stopped Morrison for driving erratically and found drugs and weapons in his car, which resulted in various drugs and firearms charges. While awaiting trial on the September 16 charges, Morrison was again arrested on charges of intoxication and weapon possession while a felon in November 1999. On January 14, 2000, Morrison was sentenced to two years in prison on the September 16 charges. On April 3, 2002, he was sentenced to another year in prison after violating parole in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but was given credit for time previously served.

==Death==
In August 2013, Morrison&#x27;s mother, Diana, said that Tommy had &quot;full-blown AIDS&quot; and was &quot;in his final days.&quot; She also stated that Morrison had been bedridden for over a year. Morrison&#x27;s wife, Trisha, allegedly did not believe Morrison had AIDS.

On September 1, 2013, Morrison died at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, at the age of 44. According to the Nebraska Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Morrison&#x27;s cause of death was cardiac arrest, resulting from multiorgan failure due to septic shock caused by a &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infection.

== Legacy ==
The World Boxing Organization said people would remember Morrison best for his dangerous punching power and especially his left hook. After his death, the International Boxing Hall of Fame said Morrison brought &quot;so much excitement and energy to the heavyweight division in the 1990s&quot;.

Two-time heavyweight champion Pinklon Thomas said Morrison hit like a baseball bat and rated him ahead of Mike Tyson as the hardest puncher he had faced. Boxing writer Lee Groves ranked Morrison third on his list of &quot;10: Best Left Hookers&quot;. He also featured on a list of &quot;100 Best Punchers of the Past 100 years&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s biography is in the Amazon paperback book Everipedia Boxing Archives, which is authored by Matthew E. O&#x27;Neil. The book is in multiple libraries, including Grant Library, New Hamphire State Library, and Clinton Fowler Library on the campus of Colorado Christian University.

On the 23rd of May, 2023, Morrison was added to the boxing video game Undisputed, In the Heavyweight Division.

<text>John Taylor (May 4, 1770April 16, 1832) was the 51st Governor of South Carolina from 1826 to 1828.
==Career==
He was born May 4, 1770, in Granby in the Province of South Carolina. He attended Mount Zion Institute in Winnsboro, South Carolina, and graduated in 1790 from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and became a lawyer. He opened his practice in Columbia but also had farming interests.

After school, Taylor served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1796 to 1802 and again from 1804 to 1805. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1807, and served there until he became a U.S. Senator in 1810 filling the vacancy left by Thomas Sumter. He was elected to serve a full term beginning in 1811. As senator, he was known for his especially persuasive personality. While also serving the senate, he developed the first version of what is now known as the Taylor foundation. This foundation is a gathering of aspiring politicians to come together and talk and help each other. But soon afterwards he left federal service in 1816 and returned to his home state to become a South Carolina state senator from 1818 to 1826.

Taylor was elected to state governor in 1826. He also served as a trustee of South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) and as director of the Columbia Theological Seminary. His term in office was primarily known for rallying the state to oppose federal tariffs. He died in 1832 in Camden, South Carolina.

<doc id="217693" wikidata="Q722674" url="?curid=217693" title="Brewster F2A Buffalo">
<text>The Brewster F2A Buffalo is an American fighter aircraft which saw service early in World War II. Designed and built by the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation, it was one of the first U.S. monoplanes with an arrestor hook and other modifications for aircraft carriers. The Buffalo won a competition against the Grumman F4F Wildcat in 1939 to become the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first monoplane fighter aircraft. Although superior to the Grumman F3F biplane it replaced, and the early F4Fs, the Buffalo was largely obsolete when the United States entered the war, being unstable and overweight, especially when compared to the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero.

Several nations, including Finland, Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands, ordered the Buffalo. The Finns were the most successful with their Buffalos, flying them in combat against early Soviet fighters with excellent results. During the Continuation War of 1941–1944, the B-239s (de-navalized F2A-1s) operated by the Finnish Air Force proved capable of engaging and destroying most types of Soviet fighter aircraft operating against Finland at that time, and claimed in the first phase of that conflict 32 Soviet aircraft shot down for every B-239 lost, producing 36 Buffalo &quot;aces&quot;.

In December 1941, Buffalos operated by both British Commonwealth (B-339E) and Dutch (B-339C/D) air forces in South East Asia suffered severe losses in combat against the Japanese Navy&#x27;s A6M Zero and the Japanese Army&#x27;s Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot;. The British attempted to lighten their Buffalos by removing ammunition and fuel and installing lighter guns to improve performance, but it made little difference. After the first few engagements, the Dutch halved the fuel and ammunition load in the wings, which allowed their Buffalos (and their Hurricanes) to stay with the Oscars in turns.

The Buffalo was built in three variants for the U.S. Navy: the F2A-1, F2A-2 and F2A-3. (In foreign service, with lower horsepower engines, these types were designated B-239, B-339, and B-339-23 respectively.) The F2A-3 variant saw action with United States Marine Corps (USMC) squadrons at the Battle of Midway. Shown by the experience of Midway to be no match for the Zero, the F2A-3 was derided by USMC pilots as a &quot;flying coffin&quot;. Indeed, the F2A-3s performance was substantially inferior to the F2A-2 variant used by the Navy before the outbreak of the war despite detail improvements.

==Design and development==

===United States Navy===
In 1935, the U.S. Navy issued a requirement for a carrier-based fighter intended to replace the Grumman F3F biplane. The Brewster XF2A-1 monoplane, designed by a team led by Dayton T. Brown, was one of two aircraft designs that were initially considered. The XF4F-1 with a double-row radial engine was a &quot;classic&quot; biplane. The U.S. Navy competition was re-opened to allow another competitor, the NF-1, a navalized Seversky P-35 eliminated early on when the prototype could not reach more than . The XF2A-1 first flew on 2 December 1937 and early test results showed it was far in advance of the Grumman biplane entry. While the XF4F-1 did not enter production, it later re-emerged as a monoplane, the Wildcat.
The Buffalo was manufactured at the Brewster Building in Long Island City, New York. The new Brewster fighter had a modern look with a stubby fuselage, mid-set monoplane wings and a host of advanced features. It was all-metal, with flush-riveted, stressed aluminum construction, although control surfaces were still fabric-covered. The XF2A-1 also featured split flaps, a hydraulically operated retractable main undercarriage (and partially retractable tailwheel), and a streamlined framed canopy. As was common at this time, the aircraft lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and pilot armor. Fuel capacity was only , stored in the fuselage. Powered by a single-row Wright R-1820-22 Cyclone radial engine, it had a good initial climb rate of and a top speed of . The aircraft was then tested in 1938 in the Langley Research Center full-scale wind tunnel, where it was determined that certain factors were contributing to parasitic drag. Based on the tests, improvements were made to the cowling streamlining and carburetor and oil cooler intakes, and the Buffalo&#x27;s speed rose to at without any increase in power. Other manufacturers took notice of this 10 percent increase in speed and efficiency, and wind tunnel tests became standard procedure in the US. With only a single-stage supercharger, high-altitude performance fell off rapidly. Fuselage armament was one fixed M2 Browning machine gun with 200 rounds and one fixed AN Browning machine gun with 600 rounds, both in the nose. The Navy awarded Brewster Aeronautical Corporation a production contract for 54 aircraft, the &quot;F2A-1s&quot;.

Service testing of the XF2A-1 prototype began in January 1938 and in June, production started on the F2A-1. They were powered by Wright R-1820-34 engines and had larger fins. The added weight of two additional Browning wing guns and other equipment specified by the Navy for combat operations reduced the initial rate of climb to . Plagued by production difficulties, Brewster delivered only 11 F2A-1 aircraft to the Navy; the remainder of the order was later diverted to the Finnish Air Force in modified form under the export designation Model 239.


A later variant, the &quot;F2A-2&quot;, of which 43 were ordered by the U.S. Navy, included a more powerful R-1820-40 engine, a better propeller, and integral flotation gear, while still lacking pilot armor and self-sealing tanks. The increase in engine power was welcomed, but to some extent offset by the increased loaded weight () of the aircraft; while top speed was increased to a respectable at , initial climb rates dropped to . Both the F2A-1 and the F2A-2 variants of the Brewster were liked by early Navy and Marine pilots, including Pappy Boyington, who praised the good turning and maneuvering abilities of the aircraft: &quot;the early models, before they weighed it all down with armor plate, radios, and other [equipment] ... were pretty sweet little ships. Not real fast, but the [early F2As] ... could turn and roll in a phone booth&quot;. This might reasonably have been expected with the low wing loading in earlier variants, which was comparable with the Mitsubishi A6M Zero&#x27;s lb/sq ft.

The &quot;F2A-3&quot; was the last version of the Buffalo to enter service with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. A total of 108 examples were ordered in January 1941. By this time, the Navy had become disenchanted with the Buffalo, and had become especially annoyed at Brewster Aeronautical Corporation&#x27;s frequent production delays and its frequent management difficulties. This order was seen more as a way of keeping Brewster&#x27;s production lines running; they would eventually build Corsair fighters for the Navy as well as Buccaneer/Bermuda dive bombers.

The F2A-3s were conceived as long range reconnaissance fighters with new wet wings with self-sealing features and larger fuselage tanks which provided increased fuel capacity and protection, but this also increased the aircraft weight by more than . The wing and enlarged fuselage tank carried an additional of fuel; at , the fuel alone weighed nearly . The addition of armor plating for the pilot and increased ammunition capacity further increased the aircraft&#x27;s weight, resulting in a reduced top speed and rate of climb, while substantially degrading the Brewster&#x27;s turning and maneuvering capability. The Navy found that the added weight of the F2A-3 also aggravated the problem of landing gear failure during carrier landings. However, the −40 two-speed supercharged Cyclone engine in the F2A-3 was an excellent &quot;cruising&quot; engine, and as such the F2A-3 had some value and saw initial service on the carriers &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot;.

Even in late 1940 it was apparent that the Buffalo was rapidly becoming obsolete. It badly needed a more powerful engine and an enlarged wing (to offset the increased weight), but the limits of the airframe had been reached, making installation of a larger engine impossible. Soon after deliveries of the F2A-3 began, the Navy decided to eliminate the type altogether. However, a project was begun to replace the wing-mounted .50 M2 machine guns with two M2 20mm cannons. At least eight sets of wings were completed, and at least one F2A-3 was fitted with them. By then considered a second line aircraft, some were transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps, which deployed two F2A-3 squadrons to the Pacific, one at Palmyra Atoll, and another at Midway Island. Those which still remained on board aircraft carriers narrowly missed a combat opportunity when a relief mission was dispatched to Wake Island, but the relief force was withdrawn before completing the mission. Shortly thereafter, F2A-3s still in naval service were transferred to training squadrons for use as advanced trainers.

==Operational history==
The first unit to be equipped with the F2A-1 was Lt. Cdr. Warren Harvey&#x27;s VF-3, assigned to air group. On 8 December 1939, VF-3 received 10 of the 11 Buffalos delivered to the U.S. Navy. The remaining 43 F2A-1s were declared surplus (to be replaced with an equal number of the improved F2A-2s) and sold to Finland. Ralph Ingersoll wrote in late 1940 after visiting Britain that the Buffalo and other American aircraft &quot;cannot compete with either the existing British or German fighters&quot;, so Britain used them &quot;either as advanced trainers --or for fighting equally obsolete Italian planes in the Middle East. That is all they are good for&quot;. Even the Eagle Squadrons&#x27; American pilots used Hawker Hurricanes instead of the Buffalo. Early in the war all modern monoplane fighter types were in high demand, however. Consequently, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands East Indies purchased several hundred export models.

===Finland===
In April 1939, the Finnish government contacted the Roosevelt administration, requesting the supply of modern combat aircraft as quickly as possible. On 17 October, the Finnish Embassy in Washington, D.C., received a telegram clearing the purchase of fighter aircraft. The only strict requirements laid down by Finnish authorities were that the aircraft be already operational and able to use 87-octane fuel. Part of an F2A-1 shipment – 44 aircraft originally intended for the US Navy – was diverted to Finland, by the US State Department, after the USN agreed to instead accept a later shipment of F2A-2 variants.

On 16 December, the Finnish government signed a contract to purchase 44 aircraft: a F2A-1 variant designated Model &quot;B-239E&quot; by Brewster. Unlike other fighters already in service, the F2A-1 and B-239E lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and cockpit armor. However, the B-239E was built with a more powerful engine than the F2A-1, in the form of the Wright R-1820-G5, producing , and the capacity to carry four machine guns (rather than the two carried by the F2A-1). The B-239E was also &quot;de-navalized&quot; before shipment: equipment such as tailhooks and life raft containers were removed. The upgraded engine and slightly reduced net weight (i.e. from the omitted armor and de-navalization) resulted in an improved power-to-weight ratio and better general performance.

In four batches the B-239E was shipped initially to Bergen, in Norway, in January and February 1940 from New York City. The crated fighters were then sent by railway to Sweden and assembled by SAAB at Trollhättan, northeast of Gothenburg.

After delivery of the B-239E, the Finnish Air Force added armored backrests, metric flight instruments, the Väisälä T.h.m.40 gunsight, and four machine guns. The top speed of the Finnish B-239s, as modified, was at , and their loaded weight was .

In February 1940, pilot Lieutenant Jorma &quot;Joppe&quot; Karhunen flight-tested the first B-239 to become operational in Finland. Unfamiliar with the aircraft, he burned out the engine while flying very low at high speed; crashing on a snow-covered field, damaging the propeller and some belly panels. Initially unimpressed, the Finns later witnessed a demonstration by a Brewster test pilot, who was able to stay on the tail of a Finnish Fiat G.50 &quot;Freccia&quot; fighter from Italy; although the Fiat fighter was faster in level flight, the Brewster could out-turn it.

None of the B-239E fighters saw combat in the Winter War (1939–1940). However, five of the six delivered during the war became combat-ready before it ended.

The B-239E was never referred to by the name Buffalo in Finland; it was known simply as the Brewster, or by the nicknames &quot;Taivaan helmi&quot; (&quot;sky pearl&quot;) or &quot;Pohjoisten taivaiden helmi&quot; (&quot;pearl of the northern skies&quot;). Other nicknames were &quot;Pylly-Valtteri&quot; (lit. &quot;butt-walter&quot;), &quot;Amerikanrauta&quot; (&quot;American hardware&quot; or &quot;American car&quot;) and &quot;Lentävä kaljapullo&quot; (&quot;flying beer-bottle&quot;). The total of 44 examples of the B-239E fighters used by the FAF received serial numbers &quot;BW-351&quot; to &quot;BW-394&quot;.
Finnish pilots regarded the B-239E as being easy to fly, or in the words of ace Ilmari Juutilainen, a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s travelling [or touring] plane&quot;. The Buffalo was also popular within the FAF because of its relatively long range and good maintenance record. This was in part due to the efforts of the Finnish mechanics, who solved a problem that plagued the Wright Cyclone engine by inverting one of the piston rings in each cylinder, which had a positive effect on reliability. The cooler weather of Finland also helped, because the engine was prone to overheating as noted in tropical Pacific use. The Brewster Buffalo earned a reputation in Finnish Air Force service as one of its more successful fighter aircraft, along with the Fiat G.50, which scored an unprecedented kill-loss ratio of 33-1.

In service from 1941 to 1945, Buffalos of &quot;Lentolaivue&quot; 24 (Fighter Squadron 24) claimed 477 Soviet Air Force warplanes destroyed, with the combat loss of just 19 Buffalos, an outstanding victory ratio of 26:1.

During the Continuation War, &quot;Lentolaivue&quot; 24 (Fighter Squadron 24) was equipped with the B-239s until May 1944, when the Buffalos were transferred to &quot;Hävittäjälentolaivue&quot; 26 (Fighter Squadron 26). Most of the pilots of &quot;Lentolaivue&quot; 24 were Winter War combat veterans. This squadron claimed a total of 459 Soviet aircraft with B-239s, while losing 15 Buffalos in combat.

The Brewsters had their baptism by fire in Finland on 25 June 1941, when a pair of Buffalos from 2/LLv24, operating from Selänpää airfield (ICAO:EFSE) intercepted 27 Soviet Tupolev SBs from 201st SBAP near Heinola. Five SBs were claimed as downed. Subsequent attacks were repelled by LLv24 pilots who, by dusk, had flown 77 sorties.

Many Finnish pilots racked up enormous scores by using basic tactics against Soviet aircraft. The default tactic was the four-plane &quot;parvi&quot; (swarm), with a pair flying lower as bait, and a higher pair to dive on enemy interceptors. The Soviet Air Force was never able to counter this tactic. The top-scoring B-239 pilot was Hans Wind, with 39 kills. Lt Hans Wind, with six other Buffalos of LeLv 24, intercepted some 60 Soviet aircraft near Kronstad. Two Soviet Pe-2 bombers, one Soviet Hawker Hurricane fighter, and 12 I-16s were claimed for the loss of just one B-239 (BW-378). After evaluation of claims against actual Soviet losses, aircraft &quot;BW-364&quot; was found to have been used to achieve 42½ kills in total by all pilots operating it, possibly making it the highest-scoring fighter airframe in the history of air warfare. The top scoring Finnish ace, Ilmari Juutilainen, scored 34 of his 94½ kills in B-239s, including 28 in BW-364.

During the Continuation War, a lack of replacements led the Finns to develop a copy of the Buffalo built from non-strategic materials such as plywood, however the &quot;Humu&quot;, as they called it, was already obsolete and only a single prototype was built. By late 1943, the lack of spares, wear-and-tear, and better Soviet fighters and training greatly reduced the effectiveness of Finnish B-239s, though LeLv 26 pilots would still claim some 35 victories against Soviet aircraft in mid-1944. The last victory by a Buffalo against Soviet aircraft was claimed over the Karelian Isthmus on 17 June 1944.

From 1943, Finland&#x27;s air force received Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs from Germany, and this much-superior fighter re-equipped most Finnish Air Force fighter squadrons.

After Finland signed an armistice with the Soviet Union in September, 1944, they had to drive Finland&#x27;s former ally, Nazi Germany out of the country during the &quot;Lapland War&quot;. The only clash with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took place on 3 October 1944 when HLeLV 26 intercepted Junkers Ju 87s, claiming two, the last victories to be made by Brewster pilots in World War II. By the end of the war in Lapland, only eight B-239s were left.

Five B-239s continued to fly until 1948, with last flights of Brewsters by the Finnish Air Force on 14 September 1948, when they were stored until scrapped in 1953.

===Belgium===
Just before the start of the war, Belgium sought more modern aircraft to expand and modernize its air force. Belgium ordered 40 Brewster B-339 aircraft, a de-navalized F2A-2, fitted with the Wright R-1820-G-105 engine approved for export use. The G-105 engine had a power output of (peak) on takeoff, some less than the engine fitted to the U.S. Navy F2A-2. The arrestor hook and liferaft container were removed, and the aircraft was modified with a slightly longer tail.

Only one aircraft reached France by the time Germany launched its &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; in the West on 10 May 1940. The Buffalo was later captured intact by the Germans, and it was partially rediscovered near Darmstadt in 1945.

Six more Belgian Brewsters were offloaded at the French Caribbean island of Martinique and languished on a coastal hillside, never to be flown. The rest of the order went to the RAF.

===British Commonwealth (Malaya)===

Facing a shortage of combat aircraft in January 1940, the British Purchasing Commission was established to acquire U.S. aircraft that would help supplement domestic production. Among the U.S. fighter aircraft that caught the Commission&#x27;s attention was the Brewster. The remaining 32 B-339 aircraft ordered by the Belgians, suspended at the fall of France, were passed on to the United Kingdom. Appraisal by Royal Air Force acceptance personnel criticized it on numerous points including inadequate armament and lack of pilot armor, poor high-altitude performance, engine overheating, maintenance issues, and cockpit controls, while it was praised for its handling, roomy cockpit, and visibility. With a top speed of about at , but with fuel starvation issues over , it was considered unfit for duty in western Europe. Still desperately in need of fighter aircraft in the Pacific and Asia for British and Commonwealth air forces, the UK ordered an additional 170 aircraft under the type specification &quot;B-339E&quot;.

Delivery and assembly of the Buffalos in Singapore took place in the spring of 1941. The first Buffalo units (Nos 67 and 243 Squadron RAF) were formed at RAF Kallang in March 1941.

The B-339E, or Brewster Buffalo Mk I as it was designated in British service, was initially intended to be fitted with an export-approved Wright R-1820-G-105 Cyclone engine with a (peak takeoff) engine. The Brewster aircraft delivered to British and Commonwealth air forces were significantly altered from the B-339 type sold to the Belgium and French forces in accordance with their purchase order. The Brewster factory removed the Navy life raft container and arrestor hook, while adding many new items of equipment, including a British Mk III reflector gun sight, a gun camera, a larger fixed pneumatic tire tail wheel, fire extinguisher, engine shutters, a larger battery, and reinforced armor plating and armored glass behind the canopy windshield.

The Brewster Model B-339E, as modified and supplied to Great Britain was distinctly inferior in performance to the F2A-2 (Model B-339) from the original order. It had a less powerful () engine compared to the F2A-2&#x27;s Cyclone, yet was substantially heavier due to all of the additional modifications by some . The semi-retractable tail wheel had been exchanged for a larger fixed model, which was also less aerodynamic. Top speed was reduced from at combat altitudes.

In its original form, the B-339 had a theoretical maximum speed of at a rather unrealistic , but fuel starvation problems and poor supercharger performance at higher altitudes meant that this figure was never achieved in combat; the B-339E was no different in this regard. Its maneuverability was severely impaired (the aircraft was unable to perform loops), and initial rate of climb was reduced to . The Wright Cyclone 1890-G-105 engine designated for use in the Buffalo Mk I was in short supply; many aircraft were fitted with secondhand Wright engines sourced from Douglas DC-3 airliners and rebuilt to G105 or G102A specifications by Wright. In service, some effort was made by at least one Brewster squadron to improve the type&#x27;s sluggish performance; a few aircraft were lightened by some by removing armor plate, armored windshields, radios, gun camera, and all other unnecessary equipment, and by replacing the machine guns with machine guns. The fuselage tanks were filled with a minimum of fuel, and run on high-octane aviation petrol where available. At Alor Star airfield in Malaya, the Japanese captured over of high-octane aviation petrol from British forces, which they promptly used in their own fighter aircraft.
Many of the pilots assigned the Buffalo lacked adequate training and experience in the type. A total of 20 of the original 169 Buffalos were lost in training accidents during 1941. By December 1941, approximately 150 Buffalo B-339E aircraft made up the bulk of the British fighter defenses of Burma, Malaya and Singapore. The two RAAF, two RAF, and one RNZAF squadrons, during December 1941 – January 1942, were beset with numerous problems, including poorly built and ill-equipped aircraft. Aviation historian Dan Ford characterized it as, &quot;The performance... was pathetic.&quot; Inadequate spare parts and support staff, airfields that were difficult to defend against air attack, lack of a clear and coherent command structure, a Japanese spy in the Army air liaison staff, antagonism between RAF and RAAF squadrons and personnel, and inexperienced pilots lacking appropriate training would lead to disaster. Although the Mk I had .50-inch guns, many aircraft were equipped with .303 Browning mounts and electric firing solenoids, which tended to fail in service. Moreover, according to Flight Lieutenant Mowbray Garden of 243 Squadron RAF, the Buffalos were supplied with only armour-piercing ammunition and no incendiary; Japanese aircraft lacked armor and self-sealing fuel tanks in the early years of the war, a fact unknown to the Allies at the time.
When the Japanese invaded northern Malaya on 8 December 1941, the B-339E initially performed adequately. Against the Nakajima Ki-27 &quot;Nate&quot;, the overloaded Brewsters could at least hold their own if given time to get to altitude, and at first achieved a respectable number of kills. However, the appearance of ever greater numbers of Japanese fighters, including markedly superior types such as the Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot; soon overwhelmed the Buffalo pilots, both in the air and on the ground. Another significant factor was the Brewster engine&#x27;s tendency to overheat in the tropical climate, which caused oil to spray over the windscreen, usually forcing an aborted mission and greatly complicating attempts to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft. In the end, more than 60 Buffalo Mk I (B-339E) aircraft were shot down in combat, 40 destroyed on the ground, and approximately 20 more destroyed in accidents. Only about 20 Buffalos survived to reach India or the Dutch East Indies. The last airworthy Buffalo in Singapore flew out on 10 February, five days before the island fell.

It is not entirely clear how many Japanese aircraft the Buffalo squadrons shot down, although RAAF pilots alone managed to shoot down at least 20. Eighty were claimed in total, a ratio of kills to losses of just 1.3 to 1. Additionally, most of the Japanese aircraft shot down by the Buffalos were bombers. The Hawker Hurricane, which fought in Singapore alongside the Buffalo from 20 January, also suffered severe losses from ground attack; most were destroyed. The Fleet Air Arm also used the Buffalo in the Mediterranean in the Battle of Crete in early 1941.

The Brewster Mark I produced four Commonwealth aces: Geoff Fisken, Maurice Holder, A. W. B. (Alf) Clare and R. D. (Doug) Vanderfield. New Zealander Fisken, the top-scoring pilot, later flew RNZAF P-40s and became the highest-scoring Commonwealth pilot within the Pacific theatre.

==== Japanese invasion of Burma ====
No. 67 Squadron RAF was originally formed in Singapore before their redeployment to Burma in October 1941. They were equipped with thirty Buffalos inherited from 60 Squadron RAF at Mingaladon; the aircraft they received in Singapore were passed on to 488 Squadron RNZAF. They were joined by Curtiss P-40 fighters of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers). AVG crews were initially impressed with the Buffalo, some even urging General Claire Chennault to trade a squadron of P-40s for Buffalos. In response, Chennault arranged a mock dogfight between both fighters, with 1st Lieutenant Erik Shilling flying the P-40 and Squadron Leader Jack Brandt flying the Buffalo. Over their training base in Toungoo, the P-40 proved to be superior to the Buffalo. When Shilling and Brandt met again fifty years later, the RAF pilot said, &quot;how I wish I could have swapped my aircraft for yours&quot;.

The squadron first saw action on 23 December 1941, when 15 Buffalos intercepted a formation of 42 Ki-21 heavy bombers, 27 Ki-30 light bombers and 30 Ki-27 fighters during a daylight raid on Rangoon. Together with twelve P-40s, they claimed 13 bombers destroyed and seven probable; four P-40s including two pilots were lost while all the Buffalos returned safely. Nevertheless, the Japanese succeeded in bombing Rangoon, its port facilities and RAF Mingaladon, inflicting extensive damage and casualties.

The Buffalos and P-40s carried out air defenses over Rangoon and Mingaladon as well as strafing missions on Japanese airfields. Like Malaya and Singapore, lack of effective early warning systems greatly hampered British and AVG efforts to defend Burma from air raids. Reports of Japanese aircraft performance from the Malayan Campaign prompted Buffalo pilots in Burma to employ different tactics; according to Flight Sergeant Vic Bargh, &quot;come in from above, or at the same level at the very least, then dive away before they got onto you, because if they did get onto you, well, you were shot down&quot;. One of the Buffalo&#x27;s final victories of the Burma Campaign was claimed by Bargh; he found the wreckage of the bomber and had his picture taken with it as proof.

The IJAAF secured air superiority over Rangoon by early February 1942, and with the situation on the ground rapidly deteriorating, No. 67 Squadron withdrew north to Toungoo. On 13 February, the squadron moved further north to Magwe with only eight Buffalos, where they continued to carry out reconnaissance flights as well as escorting Westland Lysanders on ground attack missions. The Buffalo flew its last combat sortie with the RAF on 5 March, escorting Hawker Hurricanes and Bristol Blenheims for an attack on a Japanese airbase in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Only six Buffalos remained when the squadron withdrew to Calcutta, India on 11 March to re-equip with Hurricanes. They were swiftly relegated to training duties, though two were briefly acquired by No. 146 Squadron RAF in early April, one of which was regularly flown by Squadron Leader Count Manfred Czernin. No. 67 Squadron claimed 27 Japanese aircraft destroyed; eight Buffalos were shot down and eight pilots were killed. For their actions, Squadron Leader Jack Brandt and Flight Lieutenant Colin Pinckney were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (the latter posthumously), while Sergeant Gordon Williams received the Distinguished Flying Medal.

===Netherlands East Indies===

The &quot;Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger&quot; (&quot;Military Air Service of the Royal Netherlands East Indian Army&quot;, ML-KNIL) had ordered 144 Brewster B-339C and D and B-439 models, the former with rebuilt Wright G-105 engines supplied by the Dutch and the latter two with new Wright R-1820-40 engines purchased from Wright by Brewster. By the time the Pacific War broke out, only about 30 Buffalos had entered service in the Dutch East Indies. In total, 72 Buffalos were delivered to the Netherlands East Indies before deliveries were diverted to the RAAF. A small number served briefly at Singapore before being withdrawn for the defense of Borneo and Java.

As the Brewster B-339 aircraft used by the ML-KNIL were lighter than the modified B-339E Brewster Mark Is used by British, Australian, and New Zealand air forces, they were able to successfully engage the Japanese Army Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot;, although both the &quot;Oscar&quot; and the Japanese Navy&#x27;s A6M Zero still out-climbed the B-339 at combat altitudes (the Zero was faster as well). After the first few engagements, the Dutch halved the fuel and ammo load in the wing, which allowed their Buffalos (and their Hurricanes) to stay with the Oscars in turns. In February 1942 they received new model gunsights. Around the same time the Dutch started to use tracer ammunition as well. These two improved their hit ratio. Still, their lack of heavy machine guns (.50&quot;) meant their success rate wasn&#x27;t as high as it could have been.

Apart from their role as fighters, the Brewster fighters were also used as dive bombers against Japanese troopships. Although reinforced by British Commonwealth Buffalo Mk I (B-339E) aircraft retreating from Malaya, the Dutch squadrons faced superior numbers in the air, usually odds of one against two or three. Timely early warning from British radar would have countered this deficit, especially in avoiding unnecessary losses from raids on airfields, but the British government had decided too late to send these: the first British radar stations became operational only towards the end of February.

In a major engagement above Semplak on 19 February 1942, eight Dutch Brewster fighters intercepted a formation of about 35 Japanese bombers with an escort of about 20 Zeros. The Brewster pilots destroyed 11 Japanese aircraft and lost four Brewsters; two Dutch pilots died.

Only four airworthy Buffalos remained on 7 March. Capt. Jacob van Helsdingen led this flight on its final sortie that day, and was credited with a Zero before he was killed. This made him and Lt. August Deibel the most successful Dutch pilots on the Buffalo with three victories each. Altogether, 17 ML-KNIL pilots were killed, and 30 aircraft shot down; 15 were destroyed on the ground, and several were lost to misadventure. Dutch pilots claimed 55 enemy aircraft destroyed.

===USAAF/RAAF in Australia===
Following the surrender of the Netherlands East Indies on 8 March 1942, a shipment of 17 Brewster B339-23 fighters ordered for the ML-KNIL was diverted to the US Fifth Air Force in Australia.

All of these Buffalos were subsequently lent to the RAAF, which gave them the serial number prefix &quot;A51–&quot;. They were used mainly for air defence duties outside frontline areas, photo-reconnaissance and as mock targets in gunnery training. They served with 1 PRU, 24 Sqn, 25 Sqn, 85 Sqn and the Air Gunnery Training School, at RAAF Williamtown.

Between August 1942 and November 1943, 10 of these Buffalos constituted the air defense force for Perth, Western Australia, while assigned to 25 and 85 Sqns at RAAF Pearce and RAAF Guildford.
In 1944, all of the surviving aircraft were transferred to the USAAF.

===U.S. Marine Corps===

At Midway Island, United States Marine Corps fighter squadron VMF-221 operated a mixed group of 20 Brewster F2A-3 Buffalos and seven Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats. They were originally assigned to as part of a relief force bound for Wake Island, but were diverted to Midway instead after the force was controversially recalled on 22 December 1941. Wake Island fell on the following day. The squadron first saw action on 10 March 1942 when a Kawanishi H8K &quot;Emily&quot; flying boat was shot down by Captain James L. Neefus near Midway, the Buffalo&#x27;s first kill in U.S. service.

From February - April 1942 the rebuilt squadron VMF-211 (most of which had been lost in the Battle of Wake Island) was re-equipped with F2A-3s and was ferried by the escort carrier Long Island to Palmyra Atoll, where it remained until recalled in July of that year, ferrying their aircraft to land on Long Island to return to Hawaii to re-equip with F4F-4s.

During the Battle of Midway in 1942, VMF-221 was destined to participate in one of the few aerial combats involving the Buffalo in U.S. military service. The initial Buffalo interception of the first Japanese air raid was led by Major Floyd B. Parks, whose 13-aircraft division did not fly in paired flights of mutually supporting aircraft. After attacking a formation of 30–40 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers escorted by 36 Zeros, the Marines, flying in two divisions of aircraft, downed several Japanese bombers before the escorting Zeros reacted; a furious dogfight developed. Thirteen out of 20 Buffalos were lost; of the six Wildcats, only two remained flyable at the end of the mission. The losses included the Marine air commander, Major Parks, who bailed out of his burning Buffalo, only to be strafed by Zeros after parachuting into the sea.

The Marine pilots who managed to shake off the Zeros used high speed split-s turns or very steep dives. These maneuvers were later found to be the best means to evade pursuit by the highly maneuverable Japanese fighters. One F2A-3 pilot, Marine Captain William Humberd, dove away from his pursuers, then attacked a Zero in a head-on pass, shooting his opponent down. In the battle, some F2A-3s suffered from inoperative guns. The nose-mounted guns&#x27; occasional failure to fire was noticed by other users as well; the phenomenon may have been caused by frayed electrical wires in the mechanism that synchronized the nose guns with the propeller. Other Buffalos had not been fitted with plate armor behind the pilot, making them vulnerable to even a single bullet or shell. Losses were aggravated due to the Japanese practice of strafing pilots who had bailed out. Second Lt. Charles S. Hughes, whose Buffalo was forced to retire at the start of the raid due to engine trouble, had a ringside view of the aerial combat:

The Zeros came in strafing immediately afterward. I saw two Brewsters trying to fight the Zeros. One was shot down and the other was saved by ground fires covering his tail. Both looked like they were tied to a string while the Zeros made passes at them.

Second Lt. Charles M. Kunz reported that after successfully downing two Val bombers, he was attacked by Japanese fighters:
I was at an altitude of about 9,000 ft, and shoved over in a dive trying to shake the plane on my tail until I was about 20 feet from the water. I was making radical turns hoping the pilot couldn&#x27;t get steadied on me. I glanced out of the rear and saw that it was a Zero fighter. I continued flying on a rapid turning course at full throttle when I was hit in the head by a glancing bullet. After he fired a few short bursts he left as I had been in a general direction of 205 degrees heading away from the island. My plane was badly shot up... In my opinion, the Zero fighter has been far underestimated. I think it is probably one of the finest fighters in the present war. As for the F2A-3, (or Brewster trainer), it should be in Miami as a training plane, rather than used as a first-line fighter.

Claire Chennault&#x27;s report on the Zero and air combat reached Washington in 1941, where it was disseminated to aviation forces of the U.S. Army and Navy. This information, along with the development of two-plane mutual defensive formations and tactics, were incorporated into U.S. and Marine Corps air combat training doctrine by some prescient U.S. commanders, including Lieutenant Commander &quot;Jimmy&quot; Thach. The Thach Weave was developed for use by Wildcat pilots against the Zero and was later adopted by other Wildcat squadrons in the Pacific.

With the emergence of new tactics for the F4F-3 and F4F-4 Wildcat, the Battle of Midway marked the end of the Buffalo in both U.S. Navy and Marine Corps fighting squadrons. Surviving F2A-3 aircraft were transported to the U.S. mainland, where they were used as advanced trainers. The introduction in late 1943 of vastly superior American carrier-borne fighters such as the F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair soon relegated the Brewster F2A-3 to a distant memory.

==Buffalo aces==
The Finnish Air Force produced 36 Buffalo aces. The top three were Capt. Hans Wind, with 39 Buffalo air victories (out of 75), WO Eino Ilmari Juutilainen, with 34 (out of 94) and Capt. Jorma Karhunen, with 25.5 (out of 31.5). First Lt Lauri Nissinen also had victories in the type (22.5 out of 32.5).

The non-Finnish Buffalo aces were: Geoff Fisken (RNZAF), with six air victories, and Doug Vanderfield (RAAF) with five individual kills, plus one shared. Alf Clare (RAAF) and Maurice Holder (RAF) had five victories each.

==Surviving aircraft and replicas==

Only export models of the Buffalo are preserved. There is currently a complete Finnish B-239 (BW-372), a VL Humu variant (HM-671 at the Central Finland Aviation museum), and two replicas – one in ML-KNIL markings and the other in U.S. Navy markings.

Finnish B-239 (serial no. BW-372) flown by Lt. Lauri Pekuri was damaged by a Soviet Hawker Hurricane and crashed in 1942 on Lake Big Kolejärvi, about from Segezha, Russia and was rediscovered in 1998 and is now on display at the Keski-Suomen Ilmailumuseo (Aviation Museum of Central Finland). The Finnish museum also has components from FAF BW-393.

In June 2012, divers discovered the partial wreckage of a Buffalo in shallow water just off Midway Atoll. The aircraft had been ditched during February 1942, after an aborted landing attempt in bad weather by 1st Lt Charles W. Somers Jr., USMC (later Colonel, USMC Ret). Officials at the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, where the wreckage was found, have not decided whether to recover any of the parts or leave them in place.

In July 2008, a static full-scale replica B-339C was completed by the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Long Island, New York. The aircraft carries the markings of an ML-KNIL fighter flown by Lt. Gerard Bruggink (two kills). It was built for the &quot;Militaire-Luchtvaartmuseum&quot; (Military Aviation Museum) at Soesterberg, the Netherlands. The Cradle of Aviation Museum houses a static full-scale replica/model F2A-2, carrying the markings of unit &quot;201-S-13&quot; from VS-201, aboard USS &quot;Long Island&quot;.
