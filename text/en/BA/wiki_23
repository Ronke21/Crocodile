<text>Otitis media is a group of inflammatory diseases of the middle ear. One of the two main types is acute otitis media (AOM), an infection of rapid onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. 

The other main type is otitis media with effusion (OME), typically not associated with symptoms, although occasionally a feeling of fullness is described; it is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear which may persist for weeks or months often after an episode of acute otitis media. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation that results in a perforated tympanic membrane with discharge from the ear for more than six weeks. It may be a complication of acute otitis media. Pain is rarely present. 

All three types of otitis media may be associated with hearing loss. If children with hearing loss due to OME do not learn sign language, it may affect their ability to learn.

The cause of AOM is related to childhood anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among indigenous Australians and those who have cleft lip and palate or Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the tympanic membrane from a puff of air. New discharge not related to otitis externa also indicates the diagnosis.

A number of measures decrease the risk of otitis media including pneumococcal and influenza vaccination, breastfeeding, and avoiding tobacco smoke. The use of pain medications for AOM is important. This may include paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, benzocaine ear drops, or opioids. In AOM, antibiotics may speed recovery but may result in side effects. Antibiotics are often recommended in those with severe disease or under two years old. In those with less severe disease they may only be recommended in those who do not improve after two or three days. The initial antibiotic of choice is typically amoxicillin. In those with frequent infections, surgical placement of tympanostomy tubes may decrease recurrence. In children with otitis media with effusion antibiotics may increase resolution of symptoms, but may cause diarrhoea, vomiting and skin rash.

Worldwide AOM affects about 11% of people a year (about 325 to 710 million cases). Half the cases involve children less than five years of age and it is more common among males. Of those affected about 4.8% or 31 million develop chronic suppurative otitis media. The total number of people with CSOM is estimated at 65–330 million people. Before the age of ten OME affects about 80% of children at some point. Otitis media resulted in 3,200 deaths in 2015 – down from 4,900 deaths in 1990.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The primary symptom of acute otitis media is ear pain; other possible symptoms include fever, reduced hearing during periods of illness, tenderness on touch of the skin above the ear, purulent discharge from the ears, irritability, ear blocking sensation and diarrhea (in infants). Since an episode of otitis media is usually precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), there are often accompanying symptoms like a cough and nasal discharge. One might also experience a feeling of fullness in the ear.

Discharge from the ear can be caused by acute otitis media with perforation of the eardrum, chronic suppurative otitis media, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, or acute otitis externa. Trauma, such as a basilar skull fracture, can also lead to cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea (discharge of CSF from the ear) due to cerebral spinal drainage from the brain and its covering (meninges).

==Causes==
The common cause of all forms of otitis media is dysfunction of the Eustachian tube. This is usually due to inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nasopharynx, which can be caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), strep throat, or possibly by allergies.

By reflux or aspiration of unwanted secretions from the nasopharynx into the normally sterile middle-ear space, the fluid may then become infected – usually with bacteria. The virus that caused the initial upper respiratory infection can itself be identified as the pathogen causing the infection.

==Diagnosis==

As its typical symptoms overlap with other conditions, such as acute external otitis, symptoms alone are not sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the tympanic membrane. Examiners may use a pneumatic otoscope with a rubber bulb attached to assess the mobility of the tympanic membrane. Other methods to diagnose otitis media is with a tympanometry, reflectometry, or hearing test.

In more severe cases, such as those with associated hearing loss or high fever, audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI can be used to assess for associated complications, such as mastoid effusion, subperiosteal abscess formation, bony destruction, venous thrombosis or meningitis. 

Acute otitis media in children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new onset of otorrhea (drainage) is not due to external otitis. Also, the diagnosis may be made in children who have mild bulging of the ear drum and recent onset of ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema (redness) of the ear drum. To confirm the diagnosis, middle-ear effusion and inflammation of the eardrum (called or tympanitis) have to be identified; signs of these are fullness, bulging, cloudiness and redness of the eardrum. It is important to attempt to differentiate between acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME), as antibiotics are not recommended for OME. It has been suggested that bulging of the tympanic membrane is the best sign to differentiate AOM from OME, with a bulging of the membrane suggesting AOM rather than OME.

Viral otitis may result in blisters on the external side of the tympanic membrane, which is called &quot;bullous myringitis&quot; (&quot;myringa&quot; being Latin for &quot;eardrum&quot;). However, sometimes even examination of the eardrum may not be able to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the canal is small. If wax in the ear canal obscures a clear view of the eardrum it should be removed using a blunt cerumen curette or a wire loop. An upset young child&#x27;s crying can cause the eardrum to look inflamed due to distension of the small blood vessels on it, mimicking the redness associated with otitis media.

===Acute otitis media===
The most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear in AOM are &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis,&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

===Otitis media with effusion===
Otitis media with effusion (OME), also known as serous otitis media (SOM) or secretory otitis media (SOM), and colloquially referred to as &#x27;glue ear&#x27;, is fluid accumulation that can occur in the middle ear and mastoid air cells due to negative pressure produced by dysfunction of the Eustachian tube. This can be associated with a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or bacterial infection such as otitis media. An effusion can cause conductive hearing loss if it interferes with the transmission of vibrations of middle ear bones to the vestibulocochlear nerve complex that are created by sound waves.

Early-onset OME is associated with feeding of infants while lying down, early entry into group child care, parental smoking, lack or too short a period of breastfeeding, and greater amounts of time spent in group child care, particularly those with a large number of children. These risk factors increase the incidence and duration of OME during the first two years of life.

===Chronic suppurative otitis media===

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term middle ear inflammation causing persistent ear discharge due to a perforated eardrum. It often follows an unresolved upper respiratory infection leading to acute otitis media. Prolonged inflammation leads to middle ear swelling, ulceration, perforation, and attempts at repair with granulation tissue and polyps. This can worsen discharge and inflammation, potentially developing into CSOM, often associated with cholesteatoma. Symptoms may include ear discharge or pus seen only on examination. Hearing loss is common. Risk factors include poor eustachian tube function, recurrent ear infections, crowded living, daycare attendance, and certain craniofacial malformations.

Worldwide approximately 11% of the human population is affected by AOM every year, or 709 million cases. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.

According to the World Health Organization, CSOM is a primary cause of hearing loss in children. Adults with recurrent episodes of CSOM have a higher risk of developing permanent conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

In Britain, 0.9% of children and 0.5% of adults have CSOM, with no difference between the sexes. The incidence of CSOM across the world varies dramatically where high income countries have a relatively low prevalence while in low income countries the prevalence may be up to three times as great. Each year 21,000 people worldwide die due to complications of CSOM.

===Adhesive otitis media===
Adhesive otitis media occurs when a thin retracted ear drum becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the ossicles and other bones of the middle ear.

==Prevention==

AOM is far less common in breastfed infants than in formula-fed infants, and the greatest protection is associated with exclusive breastfeeding (no formula use) for the first six months of life. A longer duration of breastfeeding is correlated with a longer protective effect.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in early infancy decrease the risk of acute otitis media in healthy infants. PCV is recommended for all children, and, if implemented broadly, PCV would have a significant public health benefit. Influenza vaccination in children appears to reduce rates of AOM by 4% and the use of antibiotics by 11% over 6 months. However, the vaccine resulted in increased adverse-effects such as fever and runny nose. The small reduction in AOM may not justify the side effects and inconvenience of influenza vaccination every year for this purpose alone. PCV does not appear to decrease the risk of otitis media when given to high-risk infants or for older children who have previously experienced otitis media.

Risk factors such as season, allergy predisposition and presence of older siblings are known to be determinants of recurrent otitis media and persistent middle-ear effusions (MEE). History of recurrence, environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, use of daycare, and lack of breastfeeding have all been associated with increased risk of development, recurrence, and persistent MEE. Pacifier use has been associated with more frequent episodes of AOM.

Long-term antibiotics, while they decrease rates of infection during treatment, have an unknown effect on long-term outcomes such as hearing loss. This method of prevention has been associated with emergence of undesirable antibiotic-resistant otitic bacteria.

There is moderate evidence that the sugar substitute xylitol may reduce infection rates in healthy children who go to daycare.

Evidence does not support zinc supplementation as an effort to reduce otitis rates except maybe in those with severe malnutrition such as marasmus.

Probiotics do not show evidence of preventing acute otitis media in children.

==Management==
Oral and topical pain killers are the mainstay for the treatment of pain caused by otitis media. Oral agents include ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opiates. A 2023 review found evidence for the effectiveness of single or combinations of oral pain relief in acute otitis media is limited. Topical agents shown to be effective include antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops. 

A 2008 review found reason to not recommend decongestants and antihistamines, either nasal or oral, due to the lack of benefit and concerns regarding side effects, but this review was withdrawn from publication for being outdated. Half of cases of ear pain in children resolve without treatment in three days and 90% resolve in seven or eight days. The use of steroids is not supported by the evidence for acute otitis media.

===Antibiotics===

Use of antibiotics for acute otitis media has benefits and harms. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of vomiting, diarrhea or a rash. Analgesics may relieve pain, if present. For people requiring surgery to treat otitis media with effusion, preventative antibiotics may not help reduce the risk of post-surgical complications.

For bilateral acute otitis media in infants younger than 24 months, there is evidence that the benefits of antibiotics outweigh the harms. A 2015 Cochrane review concluded that watchful waiting is the preferred approach for children over six months with non severe acute otitis media.

Most children older than 6 months of age who have acute otitis media do not benefit from treatment with antibiotics. If antibiotics are used, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic like amoxicillin is generally recommended, as broad-spectrum antibiotics may be associated with more adverse events. If there is resistance or use of amoxicillin in the last 30 days then amoxicillin-clavulanate or another penicillin derivative plus beta lactamase inhibitor is recommended. Taking amoxicillin once a day may be as effective as twice or three times a day. While less than 7 days of antibiotics have fewer side effects, more than seven days appear to be more effective. If there is no improvement after 2–3 days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered. Azithromycin appears to have less side effects than either high dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate.

===Tympanostomy tube===
Tympanostomy tubes (also called &quot;grommets&quot;) are recommended with three or more episodes of acute otitis media in 6 months or four or more in a year, with at least one episode or more attacks in the preceding 6 months. There is tentative evidence that children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who receive tubes have a modest improvement in the number of further AOM episodes (around one fewer episode at six months and less of an improvement at 12 months following the tubes being inserted). 

Evidence does not support an effect on long-term hearing or language development. A common complication of having a tympanostomy tube is otorrhea, which is a discharge from the ear. The risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after children have grommets inserted may be low. It is still uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than a course of antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics should not be used to treat uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. They are not sufficient for the bacteria that cause this condition and have side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection. In contrast, topical antibiotic eardrops are useful.

===Otitis media with effusion===
The decision to treat is usually made after a combination of physical exam and laboratory diagnosis, with additional testing including audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. Moreover, it is recommended against using antihistamines and decongestants in children with OME. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion can resolve spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant adenoidectomy as it shows a significant benefit as far as the resolution of middle ear effusion in children with OME is concerned.

=== Chronic suppurative otitis media ===
Topical antibiotics are of uncertain benefit as of 2020. Some evidence suggests that topical antibiotics may be useful either alone or with antibiotics by mouth. Antiseptics are of unclear effect. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) are probably better at resolving ear discharge than antiseptics.

===Alternative medicine===
Complementary and alternative medicine is not recommended for otitis media with effusion because there is no evidence of benefit. Homeopathic treatments have not been proven to be effective for acute otitis media in a study with children. An osteopathic manipulation technique called the Galbreath technique was evaluated in one randomized controlled clinical trial; one reviewer concluded that it was promising, but a 2010 evidence report found the evidence inconclusive.

==Outcomes==

Complications of acute otitis media consists of perforation of the ear drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear (mastoiditis), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as bacterial meningitis, brain abscess, or dural sinus thrombosis. It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of otitis media.

===Membrane rupture===
In severe or untreated cases, the tympanic membrane may perforate, allowing the pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of the tympanic membrane suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body&#x27;s defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.
An option for severe acute otitis media in which analgesics are not controlling ear pain is to perform a tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the tympanic membrane to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).

===Hearing loss===
Children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic suppurative otitis media have higher risks of developing conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Globally approximately 141 million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population). This is more common in males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).

This hearing loss is mainly due to fluid in the middle ear or rupture of the tympanic membrane. Prolonged duration of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation, contributes to the severity of the disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.

Periods of conductive hearing loss from otitis media may have a detrimental effect on speech development in children. Some studies have linked otitis media to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that individuals with otitis media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing. Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood otitis media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea. More research on the importance of screening all children under 4 years old for otitis media with effusion needs to be performed.

==Epidemiology==
Acute otitis media is very common in childhood. It is the most common condition for which medical care is provided in children under five years of age in the US. Acute otitis media affects 11% of people each year (709 million cases) with half occurring in those below five years. Chronic suppurative otitis media affects about 5% or 31 million of these cases with 22.6% of cases occurring annually under the age of five years. Otitis media resulted in 2,400 deaths in 2013down from 4,900 deaths in 1990.

Australian Aboriginals experience a high level of conductive hearing loss largely due to the massive incidence of middle ear disease among the young in Aboriginal communities. Aboriginal children experience middle ear disease for two and a half years on average during childhood compared with three months for non indigenous children. If untreated it can leave a permanent legacy of hearing loss. The higher incidence of deafness in turn contributes to poor social, educational and emotional outcomes for the children concerned. Such children as they grow into adults are also more likely to experience employment difficulties and find themselves caught up in the criminal justice system. Research in 2012 revealed that nine out of ten Aboriginal prison inmates in the Northern Territory suffer from significant hearing loss.
Andrew Butcher speculates that the lack of fricatives and the unusual segmental inventories of Australian languages may be due to the very high presence of otitis media ear infections and resulting hearing loss in their populations. People with hearing loss often have trouble distinguishing different vowels and hearing fricatives and voicing contrasts. Australian Aboriginal languages thus seem to show similarities to the speech of people with hearing loss, and avoid those sounds and distinctions which are difficult for people with early childhood hearing loss to perceive. At the same time, Australian languages make full use of those distinctions, namely place of articulation distinctions, which people with otitis media-caused hearing loss can perceive more easily. This hypothesis has been challenged on historical, comparative, statistical, and medical grounds.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;otitis media&quot; is composed of &quot;otitis&quot;, Ancient Greek for &quot;inflammation of the ear&quot;, and &quot;media&quot;, Latin for &quot;middle&quot;.

<text>The is a magnetic floppy disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64 game console developed by Nintendo. It was announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 1996 launch, and after numerous delays was released in Japan on December 11, 1999. The &quot;64&quot; references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks, and &quot;DD&quot; is short for &quot;disk drive&quot; or &quot;dynamic drive&quot;.

Plugging into the extension port on the underside of the console, the 64DD allows the Nintendo 64 to use proprietary 64 MB magnetic disks for expanded and rewritable data storage, a real-time clock for persistent game world design, and a standard font and audio library for further storage efficiency. Its games and hardware accessories let the user create movies, characters, and animations to use within various other games and shared online. The system could connect to the Internet through a dedicated online service, Randnet, for e-commerce, online gaming, and media sharing. Describing it as &quot;the first writable bulk data storage device for a modern video game console&quot;, Nintendo designed the 64DD as an enabling technology platform for the development of new genres of games and applications, several of which were in development for several years.

Only ten disks had been released and Randnet had 15,000 subscribers when the 64DD was discontinued in February 2001. It was a commercial failure, with at least 15,000 total units sold, and was never released outside Japan. Most games once planned for 64DD were released as standard Nintendo 64 games, ported to other consoles such as the GameCube, or canceled.

&quot;IGN&quot; lamented the &quot;broken promises&quot; and &quot;vaporware&quot;, summarizing the 64DD as &quot;an appealing creativity package&quot; for &quot;a certain type of user&quot; that &quot;delivered a well-designed user-driven experience&quot;and as a &quot;limited online experiment at the same time&quot;, which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s &quot;longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation&quot;.

== History ==
=== Development ===
With the 1993 announcement of its new Project Reality console, Nintendo explored options for data storage. A Nintendo spokesperson said in 1993 that &quot;it could be a cartridge system, a CD system, or both, or something not ever used before.&quot; In 1994, Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America said, &quot;Right now, cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs. So, we&#x27;ll introduce our new hardware with cartridges. But eventually, these problems with CDs will be overcome. When that happens, you&#x27;ll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our 64-bit system.&quot;

In consideration of the 64DD&#x27;s actual launch price equivalent of about , Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick warned, &quot;We&#x27;re very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off.&quot; Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, &quot;CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres.&quot;

The company also explored the forging of an early online strategy with Netscape, whose founding management had recently come directly from SGI, the company which had designed the core Nintendo 64 hardware. Within its budding online strategy, Nintendo reportedly considered multiplayer online gaming to be of the highest priority, even above that of web browsing. Several third party game developers were developing prominent online gaming features based on 64DD, including Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; deathmatches and Seta&#x27;s competitive four-player &quot;Ultimate War&quot; and online racing game. Nintendo would ultimately retain the core impetus of these ideas, but would drastically alter both plans over the following years, in favor of a floppy-based storage technology and the Randnet online software and service partner—although with no online multiplayer gaming support whatsoever.

=== Announcement ===

Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi announced the dual-storage strategy of the &quot;bulky drive&quot; at Nintendo&#x27;s Shoshinkai 1995 trade show. He intended the product to be revealed at Shoshinkai 1996 and launched sometime in 1997, although giving virtually no technical specifications. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reported unconfirmed specifications, far above what would be actually launched: 4&quot; disk caddy, 150 MB floppy disks, 2.44 Mbit/s speed, 13 ms access, 2-4 MB RAM upgrade, and costing about (US$200).

The 64DD was fully revealed at Nintendo&#x27;s Shoshinkai 1996 show of November 22–24, 1996, where IGN reported that it was one of the biggest items of the show. There, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the hardware specifications had been finalized and had its own show booth. Nintendo&#x27;s Director of Corporate Communications, Perrin Kaplan, made the company&#x27;s first official launch window announcement for the peripheral, scheduled for late 1997 in Japan. &quot;Core Magazine&quot; said, &quot;Nintendo representatives insisted the system would be aggressively supported by third parties and Nintendo&#x27;s internal development teams&quot; with sequels for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Zelda 64&quot;, and 64DD originals &quot;Cabbage&quot; and &quot;Emperor of the Jungle&quot;. Nintendo&#x27;s list of 64DD developers included Konami, Capcom, Enix, and Rare. Rare officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral&#x27;s impending pre-release cancellation.

Reportedly, several developers attended the show to learn 64DD development, some having traveled from the US for the 64DD presentation and some having received 64DD development kits. A 64DD prototype was in a glass case, not visibly operational, but with a makeshift demonstration of &quot;Zelda 64&quot; which was said to be running from disk. An improvised disk conversion of the familiar &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; game demonstrated the drive&#x27;s operation and performance, and a graphics application mapping the audience&#x27;s photographical portraits onto live 3D animated avatars—a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in 2000 as &quot;Mario Artist: Talent Studio&quot; and the Capture Cassette.

The event featured &quot;Creator&quot;, a music and animation game by Software Creations, the same UK company that had made &quot;Sound Tool&quot; for the Nintendo Ultra 64 development kit. They touted the game&#x27;s ability to be integrated into other games, allowing a player to replace any such game&#x27;s textures and possibly create new levels and characters. There was no playable version of &quot;Creator&quot; available there, but the project was later absorbed into &quot;Mario Artist: Paint Studio&quot;. Nintendo announced 64DD would be bundled with a RAM expansion cartridge.

Much of the gaming press said the 64DD reveal at Shoshinkai 1996 was not as significant as Nintendo had promised, leaving the public still unaware of the system&#x27;s software lineup, practical capabilities, and release date. &quot;Zelda 64&quot; (eventually released as the cartridge game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;) was seen as the 64DD&#x27;s potential killer app in the months following the system&#x27;s unveiling.

On April 3–4, 1997, Nintendo of America hosted a Developer&#x27;s Conference in Seattle, Washington, where a surprise overview was delivered by Nintendo Developer Support staff Mark DeLoura about the 64DD.

=== Delays ===
The 64DD is notable in part for two years of many launch delays, which created an interdependent cascade of delays and complications of many other business processes and product launches for Nintendo and its partners, and the cancellation of Space World 1998 due to lack of completed 64DD software. IGN reported in June 1999 that many called it &quot;the most elusive piece of vaporware to date&quot;.

On May 30, 1997, Nintendo issued a press conference announcing the first 64DD launch delay, rescheduled to March 1998 with no comment on an American release schedule. This was reportedly attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies. On June 9, 1997, Nintendo and Alps Electric announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled 64DD.
On June 18, 1997, at the E3 pre-show press conference, the company lacked even a prototype unit to display, while Howard Lincoln stated that the company wouldn&#x27;t release the device until sufficient numbers of software releases support it. Reportedly featuring at least twenty games in development including &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and the sequel to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, the device retained its projected Japanese launch window of &quot;at least&quot; March 1998, and received its first American launch window of early 1998. Also at the show, Nintendo confirmed that the 64DD would have Internet capability, and Nintendo&#x27;s main game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, speculated that its launch games could be &quot;SimCity 64&quot;, &quot;Mario Artist&quot;, &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;, and &quot;Mother 3&quot;.

At Space World from November 21–24, 1997, the 64DD was shown prominently but its delay was extended from March 1998 to June 1998, with no mention of an international launch. &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine observed the attendees and the demonstrations, finding no appeal to the US market from any current 64DD software, which was mainly &quot;Mario Artist&quot; and &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;. The magazine said &quot;64DD&#x27;s future does not look good. And whether or not it was ever a serious mainstream contender is now open for debate&quot;, and wondered if 64DD would become &quot;just an interesting footnote to the Nintendo 64 story&quot;. The magazine, and Argonaut Software founder Jez San, found Nintendo&#x27;s third-party relations, and the third-parties&#x27; products, to be poor with no sign of improving; San said &quot;Rumors have been circulating for a while that recently within Nintendo the main priority has been [...] taking development staff off other games and projects [at the expense of Nintendo 64 and 64DD] to make sure that &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; was done on time.&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s presentation focused mainly on first party Nintendo 64 cartridges and the top selling game of 1997, &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; for Game Boy. &quot;Zelda 64&quot; had always been a killer app for the 64DD, but was now announced as lost to cartridge (Nintendo&#x27;s largest ever, at or ) because Nintendo said the 64DD userbase probably couldn&#x27;t support a blockbuster even if launched in June 1998 and because 64DD floppy disk speed cannot continuously stream 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay as only a cartridge can.

George Harrison, vice president of Nintendo of America, described the logistics of the 64DD launch delays:

In a December 1997 interview with Shigeru Miyamoto and Shigesato Itoi, Miyamoto confessed the difficulty of repeatedly attempting to describe and justify the long-promised potential of the mysterious peripheral to a curious public. He said that it &quot;would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It&#x27;s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs)&quot; To illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, Itoi said, &quot;I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to come up with if we didn&#x27;t have the 64DD.&quot; Miyamoto concluded, &quot;Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we&#x27;ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we&#x27;ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game.&quot; By 1998, IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo 64 cartridge games to have software support for an impending expansion disk. Known third-party 64DD developers included Konami, Culture Brain, Seta, Japan System Supply, Titus, Infogrames, Rare, Paradigm Entertainment, Ocean, and Factor 5.
More delays were subsequently announced. The American launch was delayed to late 1998. The Japanese launch was delayed to June 1998, later adjusted by the apologetic announcement on April 3, 1998, that it would launch &quot;within the year&quot;. The 64DD was conspicuously absent from E3 1998, having been briefly described the prior day as &quot;definitely not&quot; launching in 1998 and &quot;questionable&quot; in 1999, which &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine interpreted as being &quot;as close to &#x27;dead&#x27; as we can imagine&quot;. IGN pessimistically explained that the peripheral&#x27;s launch delays were so significant, and Nintendo&#x27;s software library was so dependent upon the 64DD, that this lack of launchable software also caused Nintendo to entirely cancel Space World for 1998.

On April 8, 1999, IGN announced Nintendo&#x27;s latest delayed launch date of 64DD and the nearly complete &quot;Mario Artist&quot;, as June 1999. Demonstrated at the May 1999 E3 as what IGN called an &quot;almost forgotten visitor&quot;, there was no longer a plan for release outside Japan, and its launch in Japan was still withheld by the lack of completed launch games. In June 1999, IGN reported that month&#x27;s completion of Randnet and the modem, as having &quot;breathed new life into what many have called the most elusive piece of vaporware to date&quot;. IGN said Nintendo &quot;is surprisingly confident about the 64DD and is predicting to sell the full initial shipment of 500,000 before year&#x27;s end&quot;.

As of Space World 1999 in August, Nintendo had set Randnet&#x27;s launch date at December 1, 1999, but reportedly had not yet set a launch date for the 64DD. The 64DD pre-order program had been recently announced for mid-September, and was now delayed to November or December. &quot;Earthbound 64&quot;, which IGN cynically called &quot;in development for nearly 1,000 years&quot;, had been heavily anticipated inside the company and globally as a crucial 64DD launch game, but the sudden announcement of its release being retargeted from disk to cartridge plus expansion disk was interpreted by IGN as unsurprising and as a sign of possible further delay or cancellation of the 64DD. Nintendo&#x27;s 64DD booth demonstrated eight launch games, including &quot;DT Bloodmasters&quot; with a data transfer (DT) cable from Game Boy Color to 64DD. Nintendo listed many more 64DD games in development. Randnet had recently been announced and was being tested in Japan.

=== Launch ===
The 64DD was launched on December 13, 1999, exclusively in Japan, as a package called the Randnet Starter Kit including six games bimonthly through the mail, and one year of Internet service. &quot;Core Magazine&quot; and IGN reported Nintendo&#x27;s stated initial retail shipment of 500,000 units.

Anticipating that its long-planned peripheral would become a commercial failure, Nintendo initially sold the Randnet Starter Kit via mail order. Later, very limited quantities of the individual 64DD and games were released to stores.

=== Discontinuation ===
On August 25, 2000, Space World was signified by the launches of the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, and by what IGN considered to be the unofficial discontinuation of the 64DD, jokingly calling it &quot;DeaDD&quot;. According to IGN, &quot;Nintendo did not speak about 64DD during its opening speech, nor did the hardware itself have any booth presence. In fact, the unofficial &#x27;No 64DD!&#x27; policy seemed to be enforced by Nintendo so brutally that had we even muttered the name of the hardware, we would have probably been tossed out of the show.&quot;

In October 2000, Nintendo announced the impending discontinuation of the 64DD and Randnet, with 15,000 active subscribers. They were discontinued in February 2001. Only ten 64DD disks were ever released, including three third-party games and one Internet application suite. Most planned 64DD games were either released on increasingly larger Nintendo 64 Game Pak, ported to other consoles like the PlayStation or GameCube, or canceled entirely.

== Hardware ==


Nintendo designed the 64DD as an enabling technology for the development of new genres of games, which was principally accomplished by its three main design features: its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks; its new real-time clock (RTC); and its Internet connectivity. The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo 64 plus the 64DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges, which are low-capacity, non-writable, and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks, which are large-capacity, rewritable, and cheap but only moderately fast.

Though incompatible in every way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD&#x27;s magnetic storage format is a proprietary floppy disk, resembling the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary Zip disk for personal computers. Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being magneto-optical technology, Nintendo&#x27;s own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic. Complementing its proprietary and copy-protected cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64 MB disk format was Nintendo&#x27;s faster, more flexible, and copy-protected answer to the commodity Compact Disc format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to copy on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles can hold at least 650 megabytes (MB) of information with a peak 300 kB/s throughput and more than 200 ms seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64&#x27;s cartridge&#x27;s 4 to 64 MB size and 5 to 50 MB/s of low latency and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD&#x27;s 64 MB disk size and 1 MB/s peak throughput with 75 ms average seek latency. The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many games, in addition to a much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.

As an example of variable storage strategies, Nintendo determined that the development of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; would be retargeted from 64DD disk format alone, to the much faster cartridge format plus expansions on the cheaper floppy disk, to optimize performance and cost.

Similar in proportion of the historical comparison of Famicom Disk System floppy disks to early Famicom cartridges, this disk format&#x27;s initial design specifications had been set during a time frame when the initial Nintendo 64 cartridge size was 4 MB, later expanded to 8 MB as with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and a 32 MB size eventually became popular over the years. Nonetheless, the 64DD disk format would serve as significant storage size expansion upon its 1999 launch when 32 MB cartridges were the norm and on into future years when only three 64 MB cartridges would ever be released for Nintendo 64. The writability of up to 38 MB per disk, would yield enduring benefits to emerging game genres and social gaming like that of the Famicom Disk System.

Many Game Paks retain vestigial detection of 64DD and optional expansion disk, most of which were never released, and proceed as a standalone game. Expansions can provide sequels, extra levels, minigames, or store user-generated content. Other storage options include a few kilobytes on the Controller Pak or on a battery-backed Game Pak, for storing basic game status.

In addition to writable storage, the 64DD&#x27;s real-time clock (RTC) enables persistent worlds according to a battery-backed clock and calendar. Shigeru Miyamoto, said this of the canceled four-year development of the pet breeding game &quot;Cabbage&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;re doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, can still raise the creature.&quot;

The system includes a modem cartridge for Randnet, which connected to the Internet and to members-only portal sites.

The 64DD has an enhanced font and audio library, potentially saving space of cartridges and disks. A 32-bit coprocessor operates disks and transfers data to the console, where the RCP and CPU process data. Like nearly all disc-based consoles, the 64DD has a boot menu to operate without a cartridge. The 64DD is packaged with the 4 MB RAM Expansion Pak, totaling 8 MB. The 64DD software development kit works with the Nintendo 64 development kit.

=== Accessories ===

The 64DD Randnet bundle includes a modem for connecting to the Randnet network and the 4MB RAM Expansion Pak. Other accessories include a keyboard, a mouse, and an audio-video capture port (female RCA jack, and line in) called the Capture Cassette (or cartridge).

The CPU-powered software modem cartridge was developed in partnership between Nexus Telocation Systems, Ltd. and Surf Communications. It is housed on a special cartridge with a port for the included modular cable, which then connects to the network. It is the Nintendo 64&#x27;s only officially licensed Internet connectivity product, and the early discussions between Surf and Nintendo to have built a modem directly into the console did not materialize.

Coincidentally, an unlicensed third party alternative was produced for America by InterAct in the form of the SharkWire Online system.

== Randnet ==

In April 1999, Nintendo ended the partnership with St.GIGA which had created the Super Famicom&#x27;s proprietary Satellaview online service in Japan, broadcasting from April 23, 1995, to June 30, 2000. The company then partnered with Japanese media company Recruit to develop the 64DD&#x27;s completely new proprietary online service called Randnet (a portmanteau of &quot;Recruit and Nintendo network&quot;). The resulting equity-owned joint Japanese corporation was announced on June 30, 1999, as RandnetDD Co., Ltd. Operating only in Japan, from December 13, 1999, to February 28, 2001, the Randnet service allowed gamers to surf the Internet including a members-only portal, and to share user-generated data including artwork. The subscription fee included the dialup Internet account, 64DD system hardware, and a delivery schedule of game disks by mail. Reportedly, Nintendo and several third-party game developers had originally planned multiplayer online gaming as being more important than even a web browser.

The Randnet Starter Kit comes packaged with the 64DD peripheral and everything needed to have accessed the service.
*64DD: The writable 64 MB disk drive system.
*Nintendo 64 Modem
*Expansion Pak: This 4 MB RAM expansion upgrades the Nintendo 64&#x27;s system RAM to a total of 8 MB.
*Randnet Browser Disk: This let users of the former online service access the &quot;members only&quot; information exchange page as well as the Internet. Once logged on to the service, players could choose from the following options:
**Editing Tool: Create custom avatars to interact with other users.
**Information Exchange: Use online message boards and share email with other users.
**Community: Swap messages with the game programmers and producers.
**Internet Surfing: Surf the Internet with the custom web browser, formatted for viewing on a television set.
**Postcards: &quot;Mario Artist&quot; was intended to allow the design and printing of postcards to be sent via postal mail.
**E-commerce: The GET Mall service sold CDs, books, 64DD games, and peripherals.
**Digital Magazine: The ability to check online sports scores, weather, and news was planned, but only features related to horse racing were released.

Nintendo had originally promised these canceled features:
*NES games: The emulator was completed for downloadable NES games.
*Battle Mode: Play against other gamers and swap scores. &quot;Mah-jongg&quot; was announced with online multiplayer mode, &quot;DT Bloodmasters&quot; with online card trading, &quot;Ultimate War&quot; with online multiplayer mode, and &quot;Wall Street&quot; with daily online stock price updates.
*Observation Mode: Watch other players&#x27; game sessions like ghost data.
*Beta Test: Download sample levels from upcoming games.
*Music Distribution: Listen to music, some of which was yet to be released in stores.

From November 11, 1999, to January 11, 2000, the first round of membership registration for Randnet&#x27;s Internet service opened to a maximum of 100,000 subscribers on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis. The Randnet service was accessible only via a Nintendo 64 and 64DD setup, and the 64DD hardware and games were only purchasable by mail order along with a Randnet subscription; the peripheral was not stocked in any retail stores. It was all purchased at one time by filling out a mail order request form at select retail stores throughout Japan: convenience stores, toy stores, and video game retailers. The hardware was delivered soon and the games delivered as monthly nationwide releases across the following year.

The plan was available in two tiers: a purchase plan for users who want to buy only the 64DD to add to their existing Nintendo 64 system, or a lease-to-own plan for those who want both the 64DD and a special edition translucent black Nintendo 64 console. Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle: (approximately ) per month for the purchase plan and () per month for rent-to-own for the first year and () per month for Randnet service thereafter. The service was accessed at an additional dialup fee of up to per minute, initially local only to Tokyo. The service later eliminated the monthly payment model in favor of an annual prepaid model, at () for one year for outright purchase and () for the first year of lease-to-own. The 64DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail.

As part of the subscription, the game disks were delivered not in the initial package but by mail on a schedule: December 1999 had &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; and &quot;Mario Artist: Paint Studio&quot;; February 2000 had &quot;Randnet Disk&quot;, &quot;SimCity 64&quot;, and &quot;Mario Artist: Talent Studio&quot;; and April 2000 had &quot;F-Zero X Expansion Kit&quot; and &quot;Mario Artist: Polygon Studio&quot;. The final Starter Kit subscription title &quot;Polygon Studio&quot; was suddenly delayed and then released on August 29, 2000.
One of the most substantial series of games to include Randnet support is the &quot;Mario Artist&quot; series, which allowed online users to swap their artwork creations with others. Contests and other special events occurred periodically. Papercraft was implemented by way of modelling the characters in &quot;Mario Artist: Polygon Studio&quot; and utilizing &quot;Mario Artist: Communication Kit&quot; to upload the model data to Randnet&#x27;s online printing service. The user can then cut, fold, and adhere the resulting colored paper into a full-bodied 3D papercraft figure.

Because the 64DD hardware package was primarily sold with a mandatory subscription to Randnet, the service was fairly popular among the limited 64DD user base. Overall, the service didn&#x27;t garner enough subscribers to justify its continued existence, and in October 2000, the service&#x27;s impending closure was announced. &quot;The 64 Dream&quot; magazine relayed a Nintendo public relations statement that there had been approximately 15,000 Randnet subscribers at the time of this announcement, indicating that there had been at least that many hardware units sold to customers. Nintendo offered to buy back all the Randnet-purchased consumer hardware and to give free service to all users from the announcement of closure, until the day it actually went offline. The Randnet service closed on February 28, 2001 and Nintendo&#x27;s equity partnership with RandnetDD Co., Ltd. was liquidated from June 30, 2001 to January 31, 2002.

== Reception ==
Rating the overall system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN&#x27;s Peer Schneider finds the industrial design language of the 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate with that of the Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical eject button, sharing the N64&#x27;s power button, and child-friendly usability. Installation is said to be &quot;quick and painless&quot;, operation is &quot;even simpler&quot;, and the whole system &quot;couldn&#x27;t be easier to use&quot;. Software load times are described as &quot;minimal&quot;, where the most complex possible point of the system&#x27;s library reaches about five seconds. The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of dialup Internet connectivity.

Schneider found the combination of the Randnet&#x27;s web browser and the mouse to provide a &quot;passable surfing experience&quot;. He described the portal&#x27;s private content as &quot;much too limited&quot;, where &quot;[a]nyone who has used the Internet would snicker at the lack of up-to-date contents or tools offered on Randnet&quot;. He was disappointed in the companies&#x27; failure to have ever delivered certain promised online features, such as game beta testing and music distribution. But it provides new users with a &quot;simple network [which] functions as first baby steps into the vast world of the Internet&quot;.

Schneider liked the overall product value provided by the Randnet Starter Kit, including hardware, games, accessories, and Internet subscription. However, the platform&#x27;s abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis rather than as a whole. Because these items were sold only as a soon-discontinued bundle, all with such ultimately limited application, he found the disks&#x27; cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges.

He found the &quot;Mario Artist&quot; series (especially the 64DD&#x27;s &quot;killer app&quot;, &quot;Talent Studio&quot;) to be uniquely compelling in creative ways that &quot;couldn&#x27;t be done on any other gaming console on the market&quot;, utilizing the disks&#x27; writability and &quot;[leaving] CD systems behind&quot;. As a flagship 64DD game, IGN found &quot;Paint Studio&quot;″s well-made art creation functionality to be both a low-cost paint program, and edutainment akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids. Knowing Nintendo&#x27;s stated plans, he supposed that if the platform hadn&#x27;t been abruptly canceled, Nintendo would have utilized &quot;Paint Studio&quot; as a source of user-generated art content for a substantial library of customizable games. IGN also called &quot;Wall Street&quot; a 64DD killer app, though canceled.

Schneider acknowledges Nintendo&#x27;s vision, attributing the system&#x27;s downfall generally upon the drastically changing marketplace during the several years of delays. He summarized the 64DD as &quot;an appealing creativity package&quot; &quot;targeted at a certain type of user&quot; &quot;that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience&quot;—and a &quot;limited online experiment at the same time&quot;, which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s &quot;longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation&quot;.

&quot;Core Magazine&quot; honored the 64DD: &quot;In Japanese culture, there is a concept known as &quot;mono no aware&quot;. While this term completely defies English translation, one of its connotations is that there is nobility in things that soon perish.&quot;

Nintendo reported 15,000 active Randnet subscribers as of the October 2000 announcement of the service&#x27;s impending closure, implying the sale of at least as many requisite 64DD units.

=== Legacy ===
New genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD&#x27;s rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and Internet appliance functionality. However, the system&#x27;s commercial failure required many 64DD games to be released on traditional Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or canceled.

Some of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD&#x27;s RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan&#x27;s &quot;Animal Forest&quot;. The RAM Expansion Pak became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games. All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.

The concept of the popular multiplatform &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series originated with the 64DD&#x27;s rewritable storage and RTC. The eventual initial release of the series was adapted to utilize only the Nintendo 64 cartridge format with an embedded RTC, in the form of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Animal Forest&quot;. That game was cosmetically adapted for GameCube (with the console&#x27;s built-in RTC and its removable and rewritable memory cards) with the new name of &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;. All games in the series are played in real time persistent game world, with the passage of time being recorded on writable media. The realtime effect reflects real seasons, real holidays, virtual plant growth, development of virtual relationships, and other events. Interactivity between real human players on different subsequent console generations has been enabled through the swapping of various Nintendo consoles&#x27; writable mass storage cards or through online communications.

The legacy of what is now the &quot;Nintendogs&quot; series originated because of 64DD, in the form of a pet creature breeding prototype called &quot;Cabbage&quot;. Never released, it had been codeveloped by Shigesato Itoi (designer of &quot;EarthBound&quot;), Tsunekazu Ishihara (designer of &quot;Pokémon&quot;), and Shigeru Miyamoto. Its publicized four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the real-time clock and mass writability, where Miyamoto explained, &quot;We&#x27;re doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature&quot; and with optionally purchasable enhancement data. A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the Transfer Pak, to be synchronized back to the 64DD disk. In 2006, Miyamoto concluded that &quot;the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making &quot;Cabbage&quot; are, of course, connected to &quot;Nintendogs&quot; and other things that we&#x27;re doing now.&quot;

The concept of a personal avatar creator app which had begun with prototypes for the Famicom was solidified in &quot;Mario Artist: Talent Studio&quot; and then has been seen on all subsequent Nintendo consoles. Those &quot;Talent Studio&quot; avatars can be imported into select 64DD games including the &quot;SimCity 64&quot; game. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki credits his work on &quot;Talent Studio&quot; as having been foundational to his conception and development of the entire Mii component of the Wii platform a decade later. The game&#x27;s concepts were reportedly specifically foundational to the characters in &quot;Wii Tennis&quot;.

The concept of graphical stamps that are seen in various Miiverse-supported games is found in &quot;Mario Artist: Paint Studio&quot; and &quot;Mario Paint&quot;.

The user-creation of graphics, animations, levels, and minigames which are in the &quot;Mario Artist&quot; series and &quot;F-Zero X Expansion Kit&quot; are revisited in later console generations. The idea of minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64&#x27;s fifth generation of video game consoles. Some early minigames can actually be created in &quot;Mario Artist: Polygon Studio&quot; in the style that would later be used in the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series of games. Certain minigames directly originated there, as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R&amp;D1&#x27;s so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: &quot;In &quot;Polygon Studio&quot; you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game, you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for &quot;Wario Ware&quot; came from.&quot;

In 2018, historian Chris Kohler said that as one of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;oddest&quot; products, the 64DD is &quot;now a sought-after collectible and a unique piece of the company&#x27;s long, long history of bold experimentation&quot;.

<text>William John Bennett (born July 31, 1943) is an American conservative politician and political commentator who served as Secretary of Education from 1985 to 1988 under President Ronald Reagan. He also held the post of director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under George H. W. Bush.

==Early life and education==
Bennett was born July 31, 1943 to a Catholic family in Brooklyn, the son of Nancy (&quot;née&quot; Walsh), a medical secretary, and F. Robert Bennett, a banker. His family moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended Gonzaga College High School. He graduated from Williams College in 1965, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in political philosophy in 1970. He also has a J.D. from Harvard Law School, graduating in 1971.

== Career ==
=== Educational institutions ===
Bennett was an associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Boston University from 1971 to 1972 and then became an assistant professor of philosophy and an assistant to John Silber, the president of the college, from 1972 to 1976. In May 1979, Bennett became the director of the National Humanities Center, an independent institute in North Carolina, after the death of its founder Charles Frankel.

=== Federal offices ===
In 1981 President Reagan appointed Bennett to chair the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), where he served until Reagan appointed him Secretary of Education in 1985. Reagan initially nominated Mel Bradford to the position, but due to Bradford&#x27;s pro-Confederate views, Bennett was appointed. This event was later marked as the watershed in the divergence between paleoconservatives, who backed Bradford, and neoconservatives, led by Irving Kristol, who supported Bennett.

While at NEH, Bennett published &quot;To Reclaim a Legacy: A Report on the Humanities in Higher Education&quot;, a 63-page report. It was based on an assessment of the teaching and learning of the humanities at the baccalaureate level, conducted by a blue-ribbon study group of 31 nationally prominent authorities on higher education convened by NEH.

In May 1986, Bennett switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party. In September 1988, Bennett resigned as Sectetary of Education, to join the Washington law firm of Dunnels, Duvall, Bennett, and Porter. In March 1989, he returned to the federal government, becoming the first Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, appointed by President George H. W. Bush. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 97–2 vote. He left that position in December 1990.

===Radio and television===
In April 2004, Bennett began hosting &quot;Morning in America (radio show)&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio program produced and distributed by Dallas, Texas-based Salem Communications. The show aired live weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and was one of the only syndicated conservative talk shows in the morning drive time slot. However, and the show got most of its clearances on Salem-owned outlets. &quot;Morning in America&quot; was also carried on Sirius Satellite Radio, on Channel 144, also known as the Patriot Channel. Bennett retired from full-time radio on March 31, 2016.

In 2008, Bennett became the host of a CNN weekly talk show, &quot;Beyond the Politics&quot;. The show did not have a long run, but Bennett remained a CNN contributor until he was fired in 2013 by then-new CNN president Jeff Zucker.

Bennett has been moderating &quot;The Wise Guys&quot;, a Sunday night show on Fox News, since January 2018. Carried on Fox Nation as well, participants include Tyrus, Byron York, Ari Fleischer, Victor Davis Hanson, and others.

=== Author, speaker, and pundit ===
Bennett writes for National Review Online, &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Commentary&quot;, and is a former senior editor of &quot;National Review.&quot;

Bennett is a member of the National Security Advisory Council of the Center for Security Policy (CSP). He was co-director of Empower America and was a Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation. Long active in United States Republican Party politics, he is now an author and speaker.

Bennett was the Washington Fellow of the Claremont Institute. He was also a commentator for CNN until 2013.

He is an advisor to Project Lead The Way and Beanstalk Innovation. He is on the advisory board of Udacity, Inc., Viridis Learning, Inc. and the board of directors of Vocefy, Inc. and Webtab, Inc.

In 2017, Bennett launched a podcast, &quot;The Bill Bennett Show&quot;.

According to internal White House records from January 6, 2021, Bennett spoke on the phone with then-President Donald Trump just before Trump went to the &quot;Save America&quot; rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol.

==Political views==

Bennett tends to take a conservative position on affirmative action, school vouchers, curriculum reform, and religion in education. As education secretary, he asked colleges for stronger enforcement of drug laws and supported a classical education. He frequently criticized schools for low standards. In 1987 he called the Chicago Public Schools system &quot;the worst in the nation.&quot; He coined the term &quot;the blob&quot; to describe the state education bureaucracy, a derogation which was later taken up in Britain by Michael Gove.

Bennett is a staunch supporter of the War on Drugs and has been criticized by some for his views. On &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, he said that a viewer&#x27;s suggestion of beheading drug dealers would be &quot;morally plausible.&quot; He also &quot;lamented that we still grant them [drug dealers] habeas corpus rights.&quot;

Bennett is a member of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) and was one of the signers of the January 26, 1998 PNAC Letter sent to President Bill Clinton, which urged Clinton to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from power.

Bennett is a neoconservative, and was an advocate for the Iraq War.

In 2016, Bennett vigorously supported Donald Trump in his presidential campaign, writing that saying that conservatives who objected to Trump &quot;suffer from a terrible case of moral superiority and put their own vanity and taste above the interest of the country&quot; and that &quot;our country can survive the occasional infelicities and improprieties of Donald Trump. But it cannot survive losing the Supreme Court to liberals.&quot;

== Controversies ==
===Gambling===
In 2003, it became publicly known that Bennett - who had spent years preaching about family values and personal responsibility - was a high-stakes gambler who lost millions of dollars in Las Vegas. Criticism increased in the wake of Bennett&#x27;s publication, &quot;The Book of Virtues&quot;, a compilation of moral stories about courage, responsibility, friendship and other examples of virtue. Joshua Green of the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; said that Bennett failed to denounce gambling because of his own tendency to gamble. Also, Bennett and Empower America, the organization he co-founded and headed at the time, opposed an extension of casino gambling in the United States.

Bennett said that his habit had not jeopardized himself or his family financially. After Bennett&#x27;s gambling problem became public, he said he did not believe his habit set a good example, that he had &quot;done too much gambling&quot; over the years, and his &quot;gambling days are over&quot;. &quot;We are financially solvent,&quot; his wife Elayne told &quot;USA Today&quot;. &quot;All our bills are paid.&quot; She added that his gambling days are over. &quot;He&#x27;s never going again,&quot; she said.

Several months later, Bennett qualified his position, saying, &quot;So, in this case, the excessive gambling is over.&quot; He explained, &quot;Since there will be people doing the micrometer on me, I just want to be clear: I do want to be able to bet the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.&quot;

On September 28, 2005, in a discussion on Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Morning in America&quot; radio show, a caller to the show proposed that &quot;lost revenue from the people who have been aborted in the last 30 years&quot; could preserve Social Security if abortion had not been permitted since &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Bennett responded by hypothesizing, &quot;If you wanted to reduce crime, you could—if that were the sole purpose—you could abort every black baby in this country and the crime rate would go down. That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.&quot;

Bennett responded to critics of his statement by saying, in part:

:A thought experiment about public policy, on national radio, should not have received the condemnations it has. Anyone paying attention to this debate should be offended by those who have selectively quoted me, distorted my meaning, and taken out of context the dialogue I engaged in this week. Such distortions from &#x27;leaders&#x27; of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.

<doc id="215211" wikidata="Q506558" url="?curid=215211" title="Brett Gurewitz">
<text>Brett W. Gurewitz (born May 12, 1962), nicknamed Mr. Brett, is an American musician and record producer best known as the co-founder and guitarist of the rock band Bad Religion. He is also the owner of the music label Epitaph Records and a number of sister labels. He has produced albums for Bad Religion as well as Epitaph Records labelmates NOFX, Rancid, and Pennywise, among others. Gurewitz also had a project called Error, which also featured Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross, and Greg Puciato. He is also the co-founder of comic book and graphic novel publisher, Black Mask Studios.

Gurewitz founded Bad Religion in 1980 with Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley and Jay Ziskrout. After releasing two albums and one EP, Gurewitz left Bad Religion in 1983, but rejoined three years later, and recorded five more albums with the band before they signed to Atlantic Records in 1993. The success of his record label Epitaph prompted Gurewitz to leave Bad Religion once again in 1994, and run the label on a full-time basis. During his hiatus from Bad Religion, he released the &quot;Hate You&quot; single in 1996 with his one-off project Daredevils, and entered a period of drug addiction. By 1999, Gurewitz had successfully completed drug rehabilitation, and two years later he rejoined Bad Religion, appearing on six more studio albums with them.

== Career ==

=== Bad Religion ===
Then-18-year-old Brett Gurewitz formed Bad Religion in Woodland Hills in 1980 with Greg Graffin (vocals), Jay Ziskrout (drums) and Jay Bentley (bass). All four attended El Camino Real High School. Soon after, they began writing songs and played their first ever concert, as warm-up for Social Distortion. In 1981, Bad Religion recorded a six-song self-titled EP, which was initially released in a 7&quot; format, and soon afterward re-issued as a 12&quot;. Compact cassettes were also produced, but they are rare.

Bad Religion&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, was released in 1982. When recording sessions commenced, Ziskrout soon left the band and was replaced by Pete Finestone. Cited as one of Bad Religion&#x27;s most important works, &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; was financed by a $3,000 loan from Gurewitz&#x27;s father. Its success surprised the band when it sold 10,000 copies in under a year. The sound of the record was vastly improved from the self-titled EP. Although not yet credited as a member of the band, Greg Hetson (of Circle Jerks fame) did a guitar solo on &quot;Part III&quot;.

Bad Religion released their second full-length, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, in 1983, but were less successful, due to the album&#x27;s poor production. It was a major change from their previous style, delving into progressive rock heavy in keyboards. While recording one song, Bentley and Finestone left the band and were replaced by Paul Dedona on bass and Davy Goldman on drums. The album, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; is out of print, but is included in their 30th anniversary box set.

After the release of &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;, Bad Religion broke up, but reformed (without Gurewitz) to produce the 1985 EP &quot;Back to the Known&quot;. The EP features the return of the band&#x27;s punk rock roots, although also reflecting influences of then current acts such as Hüsker Dü and The Descendents. Soon after, Bad Religion went on hiatus again.

After the &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; line-up (also including Hetson) reunited in 1986, Bad Religion released their highly acclaimed album &quot;Suffer&quot; in 1988. The album was a comeback for Bad Religion as well as a watershed for the Southern California punk sound popularized by their label Epitaph Records, owned by Gurewitz. The reunion line-up recorded two more highly acclaimed albums, &quot;No Control&quot; (1989) and &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1990), before Finestone left the group in early 1991.

Bad Religion replaced Finestone with Bobby Schayer, then recorded their next album, &quot;Generator&quot;, which was already completed in the spring of 1991, but was forced to delay its release until a year later. For the album, Bad Religion also filmed their first music video &quot;Atomic Garden&quot;, which was also their first song to be released as a single. In 1993, the band left their original label Epitaph Records and signed to Atlantic Records, who released their next album &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;. While moderately successful, this was the first Bad Religion album to reach any Billboard charts and two videos for the album, &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot;, were made.

Bad Religion rose to fame with their next album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, including their well-known hits &quot;Infected&quot; and &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, which are also often considered concert staples. After the album was completed, Gurewitz soon left Bad Religion to concentrate on the future of Epitaph, citing the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph&#x27;s offices as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker during the &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; tour and Bad Religion recorded two albums without him.

In 1999, after a five-year hiatus from the band, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin and co-wrote the song &quot;Believe It&quot;, which appeared on Bad Religion&#x27;s 11th album &quot;The New America&quot; (2000). Two years later, after parting ways with Atlantic Records, Gurewitz was officially back in the band and Bad Religion resigned to Epitaph. Schayer also left the band during the time and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman. Now as a six piece, Bad Religion recorded and released the albums &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; (2002), &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot; (2004), &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; (2007), &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot; (2010), and &quot;True North&quot; (2013), the latter featuring his only contribution as a lead vocalist on the track &quot;Dharma and the Bomb&quot;. Due to his commitments with Epitaph Records, Gurewitz rarely performs live with the band and restricts his input to songwriting and recording. He does perform occasional live appearances with the band at shows close to his hometown Los Angeles (e.g. he appears on the band&#x27;s DVD Live at the Palladium).

=== Error ===
In 2003, Gurewitz was recruited by 12 Rounds member and Nine Inch Nails collaborator Atticus Ross and his younger brother Leopold to play guitar and bass in an electro-hardcore project called Error. Their only release to date is a self-titled EP, which was in 2004. Following the release of the EP, Error was reported to be looking for a full-time vocalist for touring and a full-length debut; however, the future of the project has been a topic for discussion on many internet message boards. In 2005, Error recorded one new song, &quot;Wild World&quot;, that appears on a tribute album to The Birthday Party called &quot;Release the Bats: The Birthday Party as Heard Through the Meat Grinder of Three One G&quot;, which was released on April 4, 2006. Error has been on hiatus since and it is unclear whether the project will return anytime in the future.

== Personal life ==
Gurewitz grew up in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, where he was brought up Jewish.

In 1997, Gurewitz temporarily left Epitaph to undergo treatment for addiction.
He is married to Gina Davis, who had worked at Epitaph, and they live in California. He is a deist.

<text>The Mandate of Heaven () is a Chinese political ideology that was used in Ancient China and Imperial China to legitimize the rule of the king or emperor of China. According to this doctrine, Heaven (, &quot;Tian&quot;) bestows its mandate on a virtuous ruler. This ruler, the Son of Heaven, was the supreme universal monarch, who ruled &quot;Tianxia&quot; (; &quot;all under heaven&quot;, the world). If a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were divine retributions bearing signs of Heaven&#x27;s displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as the people saw these calamities as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.

The Mandate of Heaven does not require a legitimate ruler to be of noble birth, depending instead on how well that person can rule. Chinese dynasties such as the Han and Ming were founded by men of common origins, but they were seen as having succeeded because they had gained the Mandate of Heaven. Retaining the mandate is contingent on the just and able performance of the rulers and their heirs.

Corollary to the concept of the Mandate of Heaven was the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler. The Mandate of Heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in China as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler, in a system that had few other checks. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler. Throughout Chinese history, times of poverty and natural disasters were often taken as signs that heaven considered the incumbent ruler unjust and thus in need of replacement.

The concept of the Mandate of Heaven also extends to the ruler&#x27;s family having divine rights and was first used to support the rule of the kings of the Zhou dynasty to legitimize their overthrow of the earlier Shang dynasty. It was used throughout the history of China to legitimize the successful overthrow and installation of new emperors, including by non-Han dynasties such as the Qing dynasty. The Mandate of Heaven has been called the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s most important contribution to Chinese political thought, but it coexisted and interfaced with other theories of sovereign legitimacy, including abdication to the worthy and five phases theory.

==History==

=== Transition between the Shang and the Zhou ===
The prosperous Shang dynasty saw its rule filled with multiple outstanding accomplishments. Notably, the dynasty lasted for a considerable time during which 31 kings ruled over an extended period of 17 generations. The rule of the Shang kings has been described as hegemonic. Royal authority flowed from the person of the king, enforced by his military. Neighbouring clans were allied through marriage and adopted into the Shang ancestral temple. 

A poem about the last years of the Shang dynasty reads &quot;Heaven sends down death and disorder; famine comes repeatedly.&quot; Paleoclimatic data show a long-term period of cooling in the northern hemisphere, which reached its maximum right around the fall of the Shang. 

In 1059 BCE, two unusual celestial phenomena took place: in May, the densest clustering in five hundred years&#x27; time of the five planets visible to the naked eye could be seen in the constellation of Cancer, and a few seasons later Halley&#x27;s Comet appeared. One or more of these was interpreted by the powerful Lord of Zhou as a visible sign indicating supernatural approval. Early records, such as the inscription on the &quot;Da Yu ding&quot;, employ language more descriptive than theoretical: &quot;the great command in the sky&quot; ().

Although both the Shang and Zhou claimed divine ancestry, the Zhou were the first to use the concept of the Mandate of Heaven to explain their right to assume rule and presumed that the only way to hold the mandate was to rule well in the eyes of Heaven. They also stated that the Shang came into power because the Xia had lost their mandate, which had then been bestowed upon the Shang, leading to the fall of the Xia and the rise of the Shang. The Xia gave precedent and legitimacy to the Zhou&#x27;s own rebellion. No Western Zhou bronze inscriptions mention the Xia, or any other dynasty preceding the Shang. The Zhou believed that the Shang ruling house had become morally corrupt and that the Shang leaders&#x27; loss of virtue entitled their own house to take over. The overthrow of the Shang Dynasty, they said, was in accordance with the mandate given by Heaven. Even at the time of the inauguration ritual of third-generation King Kang of Zhou, the royal command read out to the new king explicitly stated the belief that Heaven had changed its mandate.

In the political theory of the Zhou, legitimate authority flowed directly from Heaven to their founding , King Wen. Although he did not live to see the Zhou conquest of Shang, his legitimacy passed to his heirs. Early on in the dynasty, there was some debate as to whether Heaven&#x27;s mandate had fallen to the senior sons of King Wen&#x27;s line, or to the house of Zhou as a group, as exemplified by an exchange surviving in the classic &quot;Book of Documents&quot;.

=== Eastern Zhou ===
The Zhou dynasty was marked by early success and expansion until the death on campaign of King Kang&#x27;s successor, King Zhao of Zhou. During the ensuing centuries, central authority waned overall, driven by socioeconomic pressures. This culminated in a succession crisis which saw the aristocracy split between two competing candidates for a number of years. When the crisis resolved, the royal house retained only a tiny amount of land and no real military power. This marked the beginning of the Eastern Zhou. During the decline of the royal house, although real power was wrested from their grasp, their divine legitimacy was not brought into question, and even with the king reduced to something of a figurehead, his prestige remained supreme as Heaven&#x27;s eldest son.

However, there is epigraphic evidence that, in private, the rulers of the state of Qin (which would go on to conquer everyone else and become the first dynasty of the imperial era) held that their ancestors had received Heaven&#x27;s mandate. As early as the 600s BCE, multiple inscriptions attest to this idea. It is unclear whether the Qin rulers meant they believed they had celestial approval to replace the Zhou kings, whether they believed themselves the appointed heirs of the Zhou should the royal line come to an end, or whether their receipt of Heaven&#x27;s mandate was construed as issuing through the Zhou king to give them legitimate authority over their own lands.

=== Qin and Han dynasties ===
When the Zhou dynasty did come to an end, Qin absorbed the remainder of their lands, as well as those of all their competitors. The Mandate of Heaven did not play a direct part in their public relations, going unmentioned in all surviving material. The Qin dynasty was not long-lived: after the death of first emperor Qin Shihuang, widespread revolts by prisoners, peasants, unhappy soldiers, ambitious minor officials, and remnants of the recently defeated aristocracy rapidly downfell the central government. The ensuing Chu–Han contention ended with the success of Liu Bang and establishment of the Han dynasty.

Surviving historical documents from the Han dynasty paint the preceding Qin in a deeply unfavourable light, emphasising tyrannical policies, the incompetence of the second emperor, and giving an account of illegitimate birth for the first emperor. In this portrayal, it is clear the Qin had lost the Mandate, if they had ever possessed it to begin with. It was an uncomfortable fact that Han founder Liu Bang rose to power from a background outside the aristocracy, and achieved victory through military accomplishments. To accommodate this, Liu Bang was ascribed a magical birth, and later a divine ancestry.

When Wang Mang took power at the end of the western Han, he used the acceptance of the theory of Heaven&#x27;s Mandate to his advantage. Auspicious unusual events were said to portend Heaven&#x27;s choosing a new heir, so Wang fabricated omens indicating that Heaven had changed its mandate, and that it had chosen him.

Following the restoration of the Han house to power, the Mandate of Heaven stood on uncertain grounds. Some theorists decoupled judgements of virtue from the mandate, seeing it primarily as inherited through ancestry, while others abandoned the concept altogether in favour of five phases theories.

=== Era of disunity ===
The final Han emperor abdicated to the powerful minister in and in this transfer of power the idea of Heaven&#x27;s mandate played a large role. The court prognosticator Xu Zhi (許芝) enumerated in a lengthy memorandum the signs he had located in divinatory and historical texts showing that Cao Pi&#x27;s Wei should succeed the Han. A sequence of written statements by various officials followed, culminating in Emperor Xian of Han&#x27;s formal announcement of abdication and Cao Pi&#x27;s accession. The announcement of abdication explicitly mentioned that the mandate of Heaven was not permanent, and no one argued that the virtue of the house of Han had not been in decline for some time. In the eyes of these authors, Heaven&#x27;s mandate followed virtue. While the idea that Cao Wei was Heaven&#x27;s legitimate successor predominated for several centuries, the alternate theory that Heaven&#x27;s mandate instead fell to the rival state of Shu Han was first articulated by Xi Zuochi in the 300s, and was universally accepted by the much later Song dynasty.

The last Wei emperor abdicated in turn to the Western Jin. This dynasty soon lost control of northern China to non-Han ethnic groups, and in the literature of the southern dynasties that followed there began to appear an object called the State-Transmitting Seal. This magical talisman was the physical manifestation of Heaven&#x27;s mandate, tied up in the fortunes of ruling families, allowing the exiled southern aristocracy to retain their sense of cultural superiority and maintain the validity of Heaven&#x27;s mandate in the face of counterfactual political reality.

=== Five Dynasties period ===

During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, there was no dominant Chinese dynasty that ruled all of China. This created a problem for the Song dynasty that followed, as they wanted to legitimize their rule by establishing a clear transmission of the Mandate from the Tang through to the Song. The scholar-official Xue Juzheng compiled the &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties&quot; (五代史) during the 960s and 970s, after the Song dynasty had taken northern China from the last of the Five Dynasties, the Later Zhou. A major purpose of the book was to establish justification for the transference of the Mandate of Heaven through these five dynasties and thus to the Song dynasty. He argued that these dynasties met certain vital criteria to be considered as having attained the Mandate of Heaven despite never having ruled all of China. One is that they all ruled the traditional Chinese heartland.

However, there were certain other areas where these dynasties all clearly fell short. The brutal behavior of Zhu Wen and his Later Liang was a source of considerable embarrassment, and thus there was pressure to exclude them from the Mandate. The following three dynasties, the Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Han were all non-Han Chinese dynasties with rulers from the Shatuo ethnic minority. Additionally, none of them were able to defeat the powerful states to the south and unify the entire Chinese realm. However, Xue Juzheng concluded that the Mandate had indeed passed through each of the Five Dynasties, and thus onto the Song Dynasty when it conquered the last of those dynasties.

The Mandate of Heaven was thought to emanate from the Dao, especially in the Song dynasty.

=== Qing dynasty ===

The Qing dynasty was established by the Manchus who conquered the China proper. Nurhaci, who was regarded the founding father of the Qing dynasty, was originally a vassalage to the Ming dynasty and later rebelled against the Ming with the Seven Grievances. But according to the Qing rulers it was the peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng who overthrew the Ming, and so the Qing were not responsible for the destruction of the Ming dynasty. Instead, the Qing argued, they had obtained the Mandate of Heaven by defeating the many rebels and bandits that the Ming had failed to control and restoring stability to the empire.
Just as stability was a sign of Heaven&#x27;s favor, difficulties were a sign of Heaven&#x27;s displeasure. Thus, emperors in the Qing and earlier dynasties often interpreted natural disasters during their reigns as reasons to reflect on their failures to act and govern correctly.

== The right to rule and the right of rebellion ==
Mencius stated that:

Thus, the Mandate of Heaven does not confer an unconditional right to rule. To retain the Mandate of Heaven, a ruler&#x27;s performance had to be just and effective and not excessively expand and maintain power outside the nation&#x27;s borders. The people retained a right to rebel. Of the political philosophers of the Warring States period, Mencius was perhaps the most radically revolutionary, deliberately eliding any distinction between overthrowing a wicked ruler and punishing a common criminal. The more conservative Xunzi, writing not much later, regarded rebellion as the apical manifestation of an unfit ruler&#x27;s ineptitude, only justified if already inevitable. Meanwhile, the authoritarian Han Feizi rejected entirely the concept of a just rebellion, going as far as denouncing such culture heroes as Tang of Shang and Wu of Zhou, rebels who founded successful empires. By the time of the Han dynasty, the right to rebellion was a politically sensitive topic, as the Han rulers could neither deny their own history as being birthed in rebellion nor embrace the idea that they should themselves be overthrown.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Confucianist elements of student rebellions often claimed the Mandate of Heaven has been forfeited, as demonstrated by their large-scale activism, with notable instances including the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan and the 2014 and 2019 Hong Kong protests.

In imperial times, Chinese emperors invoked &quot;de&quot; by striving to be good influences and performing rituals to benefit their status and keep the Mandate of Heaven. Also, the Mandate could not be given to several emperors or rulers at once.

==Influence==
Because of China&#x27;s influence in medieval times, the concept of the Mandate of Heaven spread to other East Asian countries as a justification for rule by divine political legitimacy. In Korea, the kingdom of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, adopted the Chinese concept of tianxia which was based on Mandate of Heaven, however in Goguryeo it was changed to be based on divine ancestry. In the Goguryeo story, Jumong was born to Hye Moss, the son of the Emperor, and Yu Hwa, the daughter of Habaek, the god of water. When Yuhwa was pregnant, she entrusted her body to the king of Buyeo and laid an egg, and the person who came out of the egg was Jumong. When Jumong, who was born of eggs, grew up and performed various strange tricks, the sons of King Buyeo became jealous, and Jumong eventually fled Buyeo and built a country called Goguryeo. This is a case in which Goguryeo claimed the legitimacy of expelling Buyeo under the command of heaven by setting him as the son of God. Silla is similar to Goguryeo. According to Silla&#x27;s founding story, there was no king in the area where Silla was located, but the sixth degree and its sixth degree held a meeting of painters and ruled. They wanted a monarchy in which a king existed rather than the current political system, but one day they found an egg near a well and one was born out of it. It is said that the village chiefs named him Park Hyuk-geose and appointed him king to create the present Silla. the earliest records are from Joseon Dynasty, which made the Mandate of Heaven an enduring state ideology.

The ideology was also adopted in Vietnam, known in Vietnamese as &quot;Thiên mệnh&quot; (Chữ Hán: 天命). A divine mandate gave the Vietnamese emperor the right to rule, based not on his lineage but on his competence to govern. The later and more centralized Vietnamese dynasties adopted Confucianism as the state ideology, which led to the creation of a Vietnamese tributary system in Southeast Asia that was modeled after the Chinese Sinocentric system in East Asia.

In Japan, the title &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; was interpreted literally where the monarch was referred to as a demigod, deity, or &quot;living god&quot;, chosen by the gods and goddesses of heaven. Eventually, the Japanese government found the concept ideologically problematic, preferring not to have divine political legitimacy that was conditional and that could be withdrawn. The Japanese Taihō Code, formulated in 703, was largely an adaptation of the governmental system of the Tang dynasty, but the Mandate of Heaven was specifically omitted.

<doc id="215217" wikidata="Q187166" url="?curid=215217" title="Antonin Artaud">
<text>Antoine Marie Joseph Paul Artaud, better known as Antonin Artaud (; ; 4 September 1896 – 4 March 1948), was a French artist who worked across a variety of media. He is best known for his writings, as well as his work in the theatre and cinema. Widely recognized as a major figure of the European avant-garde, he had a particularly strong influence on twentieth-century theatre through his conceptualization of the Theatre of Cruelty. Known for his raw, surreal and transgressive work, his texts explored themes from the cosmologies of ancient cultures, philosophy, the occult, mysticism and indigenous Mexican and Balinese practices.

== Early life ==
Antonin Artaud was born in Marseille, to Euphrasie Nalpas and Antoine-Roi Artaud. His parents were first cousins: his grandmothers were sisters from Smyrna (modern day İzmir, Turkey). His paternal grandmother, Catherine Chilé, was raised in Marseille, where she married Marius Artaud, a Frenchman. His maternal grandmother, Mariette Chilé, grew up in Smyrna, where she married Louis Nalpas, a local ship chandler. Euphrasie gave birth to nine children, but four were stillborn and two others died in childhood.

At age five, Artaud was diagnosed with meningitis, which had no cure at the time. Biographer David Shafer argues, however, that given the frequency of such misdiagnoses, coupled with the absence of a treatment (and consequent near-minimal survival rate) and the symptoms he had, it&#x27;s unlikely that Artaud actually contracted it.Artaud attended the Collège Sacré-Coeur, a Catholic middle and high school, from 1907 to 1914. At school he began reading works by Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Edgar Allan Poe and founded a private literary magazine in collaboration with his friends.

Towards the end of his tenure at the Collège, Artaud noticeably withdrew from social life and &quot;destroyed most of his written work and gave away his books&quot;.:3 Distressed, his parents arranged for him to see a psychiatrist.:25 Over the next five years Artaud was admitted to a series of sanatoria.:163

In 1916, there was a pause in Artaud&#x27;s treatment when he was conscripted into the French Army.:26 He was discharged early due to &quot;an unspecified health reason&quot; (Artaud later claimed it was &quot;due to sleepwalking&quot;, while his mother ascribed it to his &quot;nervous condition&quot;).:4

In May 1919, the director of the sanatorium prescribed Artaud laudanum, precipitating a lifelong addiction to that and other opiates.:162 In March 1921, he moved to Paris where he was put under the psychiatric care of Dr Édouard Toulouse who took him in as a boarder.:29

== Career ==

=== Theatrical apprenticeships ===
In Paris, Artaud worked with a number of celebrated French &quot;teacher-directors&quot;, including Jacques Copeau, André Antoine, Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff, Charles Dullin, Firmin Gémier and Lugné-Poe. Lugné-Poe, who gave Artaud his first work in a professional theatre, later described him as &quot;a painter lost in the midst of actors&quot;.

His core theatrical training was as part of Dullin&#x27;s troupe, &quot;Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier&quot;, which he joined in 1921.:345 As a member of Dullin&#x27;s troupe, Artaud trained for 10 to 12 hours a day. He was originally a strong proponent of Dullin&#x27;s teaching and they shared a strong interest in east Asian theater, specifically performance traditions from Bali and Japan.:10 He stated, &quot;Hearing Dullin teach I feel that I&#x27;m rediscovering ancient secrets and a whole forgotten mystique of production.&quot;:351 However, their disagreements increased over time, particularly in relation to the differing logics of Eastern and Western theatre traditions.:351-2 Their final disagreement was over his performance as the Emperor Charlemagne in Alexandre Arnoux&#x27;s &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot;; he left the troupe in 1923 after eighteen months as a member.:22;:345

Shortly thereafter he joined the troupe of Georges and Ludmilla Pitoëff. He remained with them through the next year, when he shifted his focus to work in the cinema.:15-16

=== Literary career ===
In 1923, Artaud submitted poems to &quot;La Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; (NRF), a prominent French literary journal. The poems were rejected, but Jacques Rivière, the journal&#x27;s editor, found Artaud intriguing and invited him for a meeting. This initiated a written correspondence, which resulted in Artaud&#x27;s first major publication, the epistolary work &quot;Correspondance avec Jacques Rivière&quot;.:45 Artaud continued to publish some of his most influential works in the &quot;NRF&quot;. Later, he would revise many of these texts for inclusion i&quot;n The Theatre and Its Double,&quot; including the &quot;First Manifesto for a Theatre of Cruelty&quot; (1932) and &quot;Theatre and the plague&quot; (1933).:105

=== Work in cinema ===
Artaud had an active career in the cinema as a critic, actor, and writer. This included his performance as Jean-Paul Marat in Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927) and the monk Massieu in Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928).:17

Artaud also wrote a number of film scenarios, ten of which have survived.:23 Only one of the scenarios was produced during his lifetime, &quot;The Seashell and the Clergyman&quot; (1928). Directed by Germaine Dulac, many critics and scholars consider it to be the first surrealist film, though Artaud&#x27;s relationship to the resulting film was conflicted.

=== Association with surrealists ===
Artaud was briefly associated with the surrealists, before André Breton expelled him from the movement in 1927.:21 This was in part due to the Surrealists increasing affiliation with the Communist Party in France.: 274 As Ros Murray notes, &quot;Artaud was not into politics at all, writing things like: ″&quot;I shit on Marxism&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Breton was becoming very anti-theatre because he saw theatre as being bourgeois and anti-revolutionary.&quot;

In &quot;The Manifesto for an Abortive Theatre&quot; (1926/27), written for the Theatre Alfred Jarry, Artaud makes a direct attack on the surrealists, whom he calls &quot;bog-paper revolutionaries&quot; that would &quot;make us believe that to produce theatre today is a counter-revolutionary endeavour&quot;.:24 He declares they are &quot;bowing down to Communism&quot;,:25 which is &quot;a lazy man&#x27;s revolution&quot;,:24 and calls for a more &quot;essential metamorphosis&quot; of society.:25

=== Théâtre Alfred Jarry (1926–1929) ===
In 1926, Artaud, Robert Aron and the expelled surrealist Roger Vitrac founded the Théâtre Alfred Jarry (TAJ). They staged four productions between June 1927 and January 1929. The Theatre was extremely short-lived, but was attended by an enormous range of European artists, including Arthur Adamov, André Gide, and Paul Valéry.:249

(For more details, including a full list of productions, see Théâtre Alfred Jarry)

=== At the Paris Colonial Exposition (1931) ===
In 1931, Artaud saw Balinese dance performed at the Paris Colonial Exposition. Although he misunderstood much of what he saw, it influenced his ideas for theatre.:26 Adrian Curtin has noted the significance of the Balinese use of music and sound for Artaud, and particularlythe &#x27;hypnotic&#x27; rhythms of the gamelan ensemble, its range of percussive effects, the variety of timbres that the musicians produced, and – most importantly, perhaps – the way in which the dancers&#x27; movements interacted dynamically with the musical elements instead of simply functioning as a type of background accompaniment.

=== &quot;The Cenci&quot; (1935) ===
In 1935, Artaud staged an original adaptation of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Cenci&quot; at the Théâtre des Folies-Wagram in Paris. The drama was Artaud&#x27;s first and only chance to stage a production following his manifestos for a Theatre of Cruelty.:250 It had a set designed by Balthus and employed innovative sound effects—including the first theatrical use of the electronic instrument the Ondes Martenot. It was, however, a commercial failure.

While Shelley&#x27;s version of &quot;The Cenci&quot; conveyed the motivations and anguish of the Cenci&#x27;s daughter Beatrice with her father through monologues, Artaud&#x27;s adaptation emphasized the play&#x27;s cruelty and violence, in particular &quot;its themes of incest, revenge and familial murder&quot;.:21 Artaud was concerned with conveying the menacing nature of the Cenci&#x27;s presence and the reverberations of their incest relationship though physical discordance, as if an invisible &quot;force-field&quot; surrounded them.

Artaud&#x27;s opening stage directions demonstrate his approach. He describes the opening scene as &quot;suggestive of extreme atmospheric turbulence, with wind-blown drapes, waves of suddenly amplified sound, and crowds of figures engaged in &quot;furious orgy&quot;, accompanied by &quot;a chorus of church bells&quot;, as well as the presence of numerous large mannequins.

Scholar Jane Goodall writes of &quot;The Cenci,&quot;Scholar Adrian Curtin has argued for the importance of the &quot;sonic aspects of the production, which did not merely support the action but motivated it obliquely&quot;.:251

=== The Theatre and its Double (1938) ===
In 1938, Artaud published &quot;The Theatre and Its Double&quot;, one of his most important texts&quot;.&quot;:34 In it, he proposed a theatre that was in effect a return to magic and ritual and he sought to create a new theatrical language of totem and gesture – a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses.The Theatre of Cruelty he theorized in the text abandoned the formal proscenium arch and dominance of the playwright, which he considered &quot;a hindrance to the magic of genuine ritual&quot;, in favor of &quot;violent physical images&quot;, which would &quot;crush and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator&quot;, who would be &quot;seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of higher forces&quot;.:6

== Travels and institutionalization ==

=== Journey to Mexico ===
In 1935, Artaud decided to go to Mexico, where he was convinced there was &quot;a sort of deep movement in favour of a return to civilisation before Cortez&quot;.:11 The Mexican Legation in Paris gave him a travel grant, and he left for Mexico in January 1936. After arriving the following month, he &quot;became something of a &#x27;fixture&#x27; in the Mexican art scene&quot;, though he was often under the influence of opiates, and spent much of his time &quot;seated and immobile, &quot;&#x27;cual momia&quot;″ [like a mummy]&quot;.;:73

Artaud also lived in Norogachi, a Rarámuri village in the Sierra Tarahumara.:77 He claimed to have participated in peyote rites, though scholars have questioned this. During this time he stopped using opiates and suffered withdrawal.:77

=== Ireland and repatriation to France ===
In 1937, Artaud returned to France, where his friend René Thomas gave him a walking-stick of knotted wood that Artaud believed was the &quot;most sacred relic of the Irish church, the &quot;Bachall Ísu&quot;, or &#x27;Staff of Jesus&#x27;&quot; and contained magical powers.:32 Artaud traveled to Ireland, landing at Cobh and travelling to Galway, possibly in an effort to return the staff. Speaking very little English and no Gaelic whatsoever, he was unable to make himself understood.:33 In Dublin, Artaud found himself penniless and spent most of his trip in &quot;hostels for the homeless&quot;.:34 After &quot;several violent alteractions with the Dublin police&quot; he was finally arrested after an incident at a Jesuit college.:34 Before deportation he was briefly confined in the notorious Mountjoy Prison.:152 According to Irish Government papers he was deported as &quot;a destitute and undesirable alien&quot;. On his return voyage, Artaud believed he was being attacked by two of the ship&#x27;s crew members. He retaliated and was put in a straitjacket; upon his return to France he was involuntarily retained by the police and transferred to a psychiatric hospital.:34

Artaud spent the rest of his life moving between different institutions, depending on his condition and world circumstances.

=== In Rodez ===
In 1943, when France was occupied by the Germans and Italians, Robert Desnos arranged to have Artaud transferred to the psychiatric hospital in Rodez, which was well inside Vichy territory. There he was put under the charge of Dr. Gaston Ferdière. At Rodez, Artaud underwent treatments including electroshock and art therapy.:194 The doctor believed that Artaud&#x27;s habits of crafting magic spells, creating astrology charts, and drawing disturbing images were symptoms of mental illness. Artaud denounced the electroshock treatments and consistently pleaded to have them suspended, while also ascribing to them &quot;the benefit of having returned him to his name and to his self mastery&quot;.:196 Scholar Alexandra Lukes points out that &quot;the &#x27;recovery&#x27; of his name&quot; might have been &quot;a gesture to appease his doctors&#x27; conception of what constitutes health&quot;.:196 It was during this time that Artaud began writing and drawing again, after a long dormant period. In 1946, Ferdière released Artaud to his friends, who placed him in the psychiatric clinic at Ivry-sur-Seine.

== Final years ==
At Ivry-sur-Seine Artaud&#x27;s friends encouraged him to write. He visited a Vincent van Gogh exhibition at the Orangerie in Paris and wrote the study &quot;Van Gogh le suicidé de la société&quot; [&quot;Van Gogh, The Man Suicided by Society&quot;]; in 1947, the French magazine K published it.:8 In 1949, the essay was the first of Artaud&#x27;s to be translated in a United States–based publication, the influential literary magazine &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Eye&quot;.:8 This rekindled interest in his work.
=== &quot;&quot; ===
He recorded &quot; (To Have Done With the Judgment of God)&quot; on 22–29 November 1947. The work remained true to his vision for the theatre of cruelty, using &quot;screams, rants and vocal shudders&quot; to forward his vision.:1 Wladimir Porché, the Director of French Radio, shelved the work the day before its scheduled airing on 2 February 1948.:62 This was partly for its scatological, anti-American, and anti-religious references and pronouncements, but also because of its general randomness, with a cacophony of xylophonic sounds mixed with various percussion elements, as well as cries, screams, grunts, onomatopoeia, and glossolalia.

As a result, Fernand Pouey, the director of dramatic and literary broadcasts for French radio, assembled a panel to consider the broadcast of &#x27;:62 Among approximately 50 artists, writers, musicians, and journalists present for a private listening on 5 February 1948 were Jean Cocteau, Paul Éluard, Raymond Queneau, Jean-Louis Barrault, René Clair, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Nadeau, Georges Auric, Claude Mauriac, and René Char. Porché refused to broadcast it even though the panel were almost unanimously in favor of Artaud&#x27;s work being broadcast.:62 Pouey left his job and the show was not heard again until 23 February 1948, at a private performance at Théâtre Washington. The work&#x27;s first public broadcast did not take place until 8 July 1964 when the Los Angeles–based public radio station KPFK played an illegal copy provided by the artist Jean-Jacques Lebel.:1 The first French radio broadcast of &#x27; occurred 20 years after its original production.

=== Death ===
In January 1948, Artaud was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He died on 4 March 1948 in a psychiatric clinic in Ivry-sur-Seine, a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris. He was found by the gardener of the estate seated alone at the foot of his bed holding a shoe, and it was suspected that he died from a lethal dose of the drug chloral hydrate, although it is unknown whether he was aware of its lethality.

== Legacy and influence ==
Artaud has had a profound influence on theatre, avant-garde art, literature, psychiatry and other disciplines.

=== Theatre and performance ===
Though many of his works were not produced for the public until after his death—for instance, &quot;Spurt of Blood&quot; (1925) was first produced in 1964, when Peter Brook and Charles Marowitz staged it as part of their &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot; season at the Royal Shakespeare Company—he has exerted a strong influence on the development of experimental theatre and performance art. In the introduction to his Selected Works, Susan Sontag asserts that his impact is &quot;so profound&quot; that Western theatre traditions can be divided into two periods – before Artaud and after Artaud&quot;.:xxxviii

Artists such as Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, Elizabeth LeCompte, Richard Foreman, Charles Marowitz, Sam Shepard, Joseph Chaikin, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, and more all named Artaud as one of their influences.

His influence can be seen in:

* Barrault&#x27;s adaptation of Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; (1947). 
* The Theatre of the Absurd, particularly the works of Jean Genet and Samuel Beckett. 
* Peter Brook&#x27;s production of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; in 1964, which was performed in New York and Paris, as well as London. 
* The Living Theatre.
* In the winter of 1968, Williams College offered a dedicated intersession class in Artaudian theatre, resulting in a week-long &quot;Festival of Cruelty&quot;, under the direction of Keith Fowler. The Festival included productions of &quot;The Jet of Blood, All Writing is Pig Shit&quot;, and several original ritualized performances, one based on the Texas Tower killings and another created as an ensemble catharsis called &quot;The Resurrection of Pig Man&quot;. 
* In Canada, playwright Gary Botting created a series of Artaudian &quot;happenings&quot; from &quot;The Aeolian Stringer&quot; to &quot;Zen Rock Festival&quot;, and produced a dozen plays with an Artaudian theme, including &quot;Prometheus Re-Bound&quot;. 
* Charles Marowitz&#x27;s play &quot;Artaud at Rodez&quot; is about the relationship between Artaud and Dr. Ferdière during Artaud&#x27;s confinement at the psychiatric hospital in Rodez; the play was first performed in 1976 at the Teatro a Trastavere in Rome.

=== Philosophy ===
Artaud also had a significant influence on philosophers.:22 Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, borrowed Artaud&#x27;s phrase &quot;the body without organs&quot; to describe their conception of the virtual dimension of the body and, ultimately, the basic substratum of reality in their &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot;. Philosopher Jacques Derrida provided one of the key philosophical treatments of Artaud&#x27;s work through his concept of &quot;parole soufflée&quot;. Feminist scholar Julia Kristeva drew on Artaud for her theorisation of &quot;subject in process&quot;.:22-3

=== Literature ===
Poet Allen Ginsberg claimed Artaud&#x27;s work, specifically &quot;To Have Done with the Judgement of God&quot;, had a tremendous influence on his most famous poem &quot;Howl&quot;. The Latin American dramatic novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; by Giannina Braschi includes a debate between artists and poets concerning the merits of Artaud&#x27;s &quot;multiple talents&quot; in comparison to the singular talents of other French writers.
A novel, &quot;Traitor Comet&quot;, was published in June 2023 as the first in a series on Artaud&#x27;s life and his friendship with the poet Robert Desnos. The sequel, &quot;L&#x27;Etoile de Mer (The Starfish)&quot;, was published in November 2024, and continues the story of Artaud as he defies André Breton and forms the Theater Alfred Jarry with Roger Vitrac.

=== Music ===
The band Bauhaus included a song about the playwright, called &quot;Antonin Artaud&quot;, on their album &quot;Burning from the Inside&quot;. Influential Argentine hard rock band Pescado Rabioso recorded an album titled &quot;Artaud&quot;. Their leader Luis Alberto Spinetta wrote the lyrics partly basing them on Artaud&#x27;s writings.

Venezuelan rock band Zapato 3 included a song named &quot;Antonin Artaud&quot; on their album &quot;Ecos punzantes del ayer&quot; (1999).

Composer John Zorn has written many works inspired by and dedicated to Artaud, including seven CDs: &quot;Astronome&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Six Litanies for Heliogabalus&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;Ipsissimus&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, a monodrama for voice and orchestra inspired by Artaud&#x27;s late drawings &quot;La Machine de l&#x27;être&quot; (2000), &quot;Le Momo&quot; (1999) for violin and piano, and &quot;Suppots et Suppliciations&quot; (2012) for full orchestra.

=== Film ===
Filmmaker E. Elias Merhige, during an interview by writer Scott Nicolay, cited Artaud as a key influence for the experimental film &quot;Begotten&quot;.

<text>Brandt&#x27;s cormorant (Urile penicillatus) is a strictly marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabits the Pacific coast of North America. It ranges, in the summer, from Alaska to the Gulf of California, but the population north of Vancouver Island migrates south during the winter. Its specific name, &quot;penicillatus&quot; is Latin for a painter&#x27;s brush (pencil of hairs), in reference to white plumes on its neck and back during the early breeding season. The common name honors the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt of the Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, who described the species from specimens collected on expeditions to the Pacific during the early 19th century.

==Taxonomy==
It was formerly classified in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but a 2014 study supported reclassifying it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus &quot;Urile&quot;. The IOU followed this classification in 2021.

==Description==
The average size of a Brandt&#x27;s cormorant is 4.6 pounds. They have a length of about 34 inches and their wingspan is 4 feet. During the breeding season, adults have a blue throat patch.

==Distribution and habitat==
Brandt&#x27;s cormorants live on the Pacific coast of North America, in habitats such as bays, estuaries, and lagoons. This species nests on the ground or on rocky outcroppings. Año Nuevo Island is an important seabird breeding colony in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, hosting Brandt&#x27;s cormorants among other species of seabirds.

==Behavior==

They typically live in groups. They breed between March and August, and usually have four eggs. Young birds are cared for by both parents.

==Diet==
Brandt&#x27;s cormorants mostly eat fish such as herring and rockfish, but their diet can include other fish as well as shrimp and crabs. To hunt, they dive beneath the surface of the ocean to catch fish. They can dive over 200 feet deep. They can hunt either in groups or alone.

Brandt&#x27;s cormorants feed either singly or in flocks, and are adaptable in prey choice and undersea habitat. It feeds on small fish from the surface to sea floor, obtaining them, like all cormorants, by pursuit diving using its feet for propulsion. Prey is often what is most common: in central California, rockfish from the genus &quot;Sebastes&quot; is the most commonly taken, but off British Columbia, it is Pacific herring. Brandt&#x27;s cormorants have been observed foraging at depths of over .

<text>Thermionic emission is the liberation of charged particles from a hot electrode whose thermal energy gives some particles enough kinetic energy to escape the material&#x27;s surface. The particles, sometimes called &quot;thermions&quot; in early literature, are now known to be ions or electrons. Thermal electron emission specifically refers to emission of electrons and occurs when thermal energy overcomes the material&#x27;s work function.

After emission, an opposite charge of equal magnitude to the emitted charge is initially left behind in the emitting region. But if the emitter is connected to a battery, that remaining charge is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as particles are emitted, so the emitter will have the same charge it had before emission. This facilitates additional emission to sustain an electric current. Thomas Edison in 1880 while inventing his light bulb noticed this current, so subsequent scientists referred to the current as the Edison effect, though it wasn&#x27;t until after the 1897 discovery of the electron that scientists understood that electrons were emitted and why.

Thermionic emission is crucial to the operation of a variety of electronic devices and can be used for electricity generation (such as thermionic converters and electrodynamic tethers) or cooling. Thermionic vacuum tubes emit electrons from a hot cathode into an enclosed vacuum and may steer those emitted electrons with applied voltage. The hot cathode can be a metal filament, a coated metal filament, or a separate structure of metal or carbides or borides of transition metals. Vacuum emission from metals tends to become significant only for temperatures over . Charge flow increases dramatically with temperature.

The term &quot;thermionic emission&quot; is now also used to refer to any thermally-excited charge emission process, even when the charge is emitted from one solid-state region into another.

== History ==
Because the electron was not identified as a separate physical particle until the work of J. J. Thomson in 1897, the word &quot;electron&quot; was not used when discussing experiments that took place before this date.

The phenomenon was initially reported in 1853 by Edmond Becquerel. It was observed again in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. While doing work on charged objects, Guthrie discovered that a red-hot iron sphere with a negative charge would lose its charge (by somehow discharging it into air). He also found that this did not happen if the sphere had a positive charge. Other early contributors included Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (1869–1883), Eugen Goldstein (1885), and Julius Elster and Hans Friedrich Geitel (1882–1889).

=== Edison effect ===
Thermionic emission was observed again by Thomas Edison in 1880 while his team was trying to discover the reason for breakage of carbonized bamboo filaments and undesired blackening of the interior surface of the bulbs in his incandescent lamps. This blackening was carbon deposited from the filament and was darkest near the positive end of the filament loop, which &quot;apparently&quot; cast a light shadow on the glass, as if negatively-charged carbon emanated from the negative end and was attracted towards and sometimes absorbed by the positive end of the filament loop. This projected carbon was deemed &quot;electrical carrying&quot; and initially ascribed to an effect in Crookes tubes where negatively-charged cathode rays from ionized gas move from a negative to a positive electrode. To try to redirect the charged carbon particles to a separate electrode instead of the glass, Edison did a series of experiments (a first inconclusive one is in his notebook on 13 February 1880) such as the following successful one:


This effect had many applications. Edison found that the current emitted by the hot filament increased rapidly with voltage, and filed a patent for a voltage-regulating device using the effect on 15 November 1883, notably the first US patent for an electronic device. He found that sufficient current would pass through the device to operate a telegraph sounder, which was exhibited at the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884 in Philadelphia. Visiting British scientist William Preece received several bulbs from Edison to investigate. Preece&#x27;s 1885 paper on them referred to the one-way current through the partial vacuum as the &quot;Edison effect,&quot; although that term is occasionally used to refer to thermionic emission itself. British physicist John Ambrose Fleming, working for the British Wireless Telegraphy Company, discovered that the Edison effect could be used to detect radio waves. Fleming went on to develop a two-element thermionic vacuum tube diode called the Fleming valve (patented 16 November 1904). Thermionic diodes can also be configured to convert a heat difference to electric power directly without moving parts as a device called a thermionic converter, a type of heat engine.

== Richardson&#x27;s law ==

Following J. J. Thomson&#x27;s identification of the electron in 1897, the British physicist Owen Willans Richardson began work on the topic that he later called &quot;thermionic emission&quot;. He received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928 &quot;for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him&quot;.

From band theory, there are one or two electrons per atom in a solid that are free to move from atom to atom. This is sometimes collectively referred to as a &quot;sea of electrons&quot;. Their velocities follow a statistical distribution, rather than being uniform, and occasionally an electron will have enough velocity to exit the metal without being pulled back in. The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to leave a surface is called the work function. The work function is characteristic of the material and for most metals is on the order of several electronvolts (eV). Thermionic currents can be increased by decreasing the work function. This often-desired goal can be achieved by applying various oxide coatings to the wire.

In 1901 Richardson published the results of his experiments: the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the modified Arrhenius equation, formula_1. Later, he proposed that the emission law should have the mathematical form
: formula_2
where &quot;J&quot; is the emission current density, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the metal, &quot;W&quot; is the work function of the metal, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, and &quot;A&quot;G is a parameter discussed next.

In the period 1911 to 1930, as physical understanding of the behaviour of electrons in metals increased, various theoretical expressions (based on different physical assumptions) were put forward for &quot;A&quot;G, by Richardson, Saul Dushman, Ralph H. Fowler, Arnold Sommerfeld and Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim. Over 60 years later, there is still no consensus among interested theoreticians as to the exact expression of &quot;A&quot;G, but there is agreement that &quot;A&quot;G must be written in the form:
: formula_3
where &quot;λ&quot;R is a material-specific correction factor that is typically of order 0.5, and &quot;A&quot;0 is a universal constant given by
: formula_4
where formula_5 and formula_6 are the mass and charge of an electron, respectively, and formula_7 is the Planck constant.

In fact, by about 1930 there was agreement that, due to the wave-like nature of electrons, some proportion &quot;r&quot;av of the outgoing electrons would be reflected as they reached the emitter surface, so the emission current density would be reduced, and &quot;λ&quot;R would have the value . Thus, one sometimes sees the thermionic emission equation written in the form:
: formula_8.

However, a modern theoretical treatment by Modinos assumes that the band-structure of the emitting material must also be taken into account. This would introduce a second correction factor &quot;λ&quot;B into &quot;λ&quot;R, giving formula_9. Experimental values for the &quot;generalized&quot; coefficient &quot;A&quot;G are generally of the order of magnitude of &quot;A&quot;0, but do differ significantly as between different emitting materials, and can differ as between different crystallographic faces of the same material. At least qualitatively, these experimental differences can be explained as due to differences in the value of &quot;λ&quot;R.

Considerable confusion exists in the literature of this area because: (1) many sources do not distinguish between &quot;A&quot;G and &quot;A&quot;0, but just use the symbol &quot;A&quot; (and sometimes the name &quot;Richardson constant&quot;) indiscriminately; (2) equations with and without the correction factor here denoted by &quot;λ&quot;R are both given the same name; and (3) a variety of names exist for these equations, including &quot;Richardson equation&quot;, &quot;Dushman&#x27;s equation&quot;, &quot;Richardson–Dushman equation&quot; and &quot;Richardson–Laue–Dushman equation&quot;. In the literature, the elementary equation is sometimes given in circumstances where the generalized equation would be more appropriate, and this in itself can cause confusion. To avoid misunderstandings, the meaning of any &quot;A-like&quot; symbol should always be explicitly defined in terms of the more fundamental quantities involved.

Because of the exponential function, the current increases rapidly with temperature when &quot;kT&quot; is less than &quot;W&quot;. (For essentially every material, melting occurs well before .)

The thermionic emission law has been recently revised for 2D materials in various models.

== Schottky emission ==

In electron emission devices, especially electron guns, the thermionic electron emitter will be biased negative relative to its surroundings. This creates an electric field of magnitude &quot;E&quot; at the emitter surface. Without the field, the surface barrier seen by an escaping Fermi-level electron has height &quot;W&quot; equal to the local work-function. The electric field lowers the surface barrier by an amount Δ&quot;W&quot;, and increases the emission current. This is known as the &quot;Schottky effect&quot; (named for Walter H. Schottky) or field enhanced thermionic emission. It can be modeled by a simple modification of the Richardson equation, by replacing &quot;W&quot; by (&quot;W&quot; − Δ&quot;W&quot;). This gives the equation
: formula_10
: formula_11
where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant (also called the vacuum permittivity).

Electron emission that takes place in the field-and-temperature-regime where this modified equation applies is often called Schottky emission. This equation is relatively accurate for electric field strengths lower than about . For electric field strengths higher than , so-called Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling begins to contribute significant emission current. In this regime, the combined effects of field-enhanced thermionic and field emission can be modeled by the Murphy-Good equation for thermo-field (T-F) emission. At even higher fields, FN tunneling becomes the dominant electron emission mechanism, and the emitter operates in the so-called &quot;cold field electron emission (CFE)&quot; regime.

Thermionic emission can also be enhanced by interaction with other forms of excitation such as light. For example, excited Cesium (Cs) vapors in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs-Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0–0.7 eV. Due to long-lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low which essentially increases the low-temperature converter&#x27;s efficiency.

== Photon-enhanced thermionic emission ==

Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) is a process developed by scientists at Stanford University that harnesses both the light and heat of the sun to generate electricity and increases the efficiency of solar power production by more than twice the current levels. The device developed for the process reaches peak efficiency above 200 °C, while most silicon solar cells become inert after reaching 100 °C. Such devices work best in parabolic dish collectors, which reach temperatures up to 800 °C. Although the team used a gallium nitride semiconductor in its proof-of-concept device, it claims that the use of gallium arsenide can increase the device&#x27;s efficiency to 55–60 percent, nearly triple that of existing systems, and 12–17 percent more than existing 43 percent multi-junction solar cells.

<text>The double-crested cormorant (Nannopterum auritum) is a member of the cormorant family of water birds. It is found near rivers and lakes and in coastal areas and is widely distributed across North America, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska down to Florida and Mexico. Measuring in length, it is entirely black except for a bare patch of orange-yellow facial skin and some extra plumage that it exhibits in the breeding season when it grows a double crest in which black feathers are mingled with white. Five subspecies are recognized. It mainly eats fish and hunts by swimming and diving. Its feathers, like all cormorants, are not waterproof, and it must dry them out after spending time in the water. Once threatened by the use of DDT, the numbers of this bird have increased markedly in recent years.

==Taxonomy==
The double-crested cormorant was described by René Primevère Lesson in 1831. It was formerly classified in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but a 2014 study supported reclassifying it and several other American cormorant species into the genus &quot;Nannopterum&quot;. The IOC followed this classification in 2021.

Its scientific genus name is derived from the Greek words : &quot;nános&quot;, &quot;small&quot; and : &quot;pterón&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;. This genus name was originally coined for the flightless cormorant (&quot;N. harrisi&quot;), which does have very small wings; although the double-crested cormorant has normal-sized wings, it (along with the neotropic cormorant, &quot;N. brasilianum&quot;) was still reclassified into the genus &quot;Nannopterum&quot; when the relationship between it and the flightless cormorant became apparent. The species name is from the Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;eared&quot;, referring to its nuptial crests. Its common name refers to the same nuptial crests.

Five subspecies are recognized:
*&quot;N. a. albociliatum&quot; (Ridgway 1884), Farallon cormorant, breeds along the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to Bird Island in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico and possibly even further south. Significant colonies of these birds may also be found further inland including areas around the Salton Sea. According to currently available information, this subspecies is the third largest among the subspecies of the double-crested cormorant. Historical records indicate that this species was far more abundant in the past, but due to human persecution and development in their breeding range, the population of this subspecies has declined. The largest colony of cormorants in North America consisted of members of this subspecies at San Martin Island, Baja California Territory, Mexico, and was recorded in 1913. Physically, this subspecies is fairly large and has white to partially white nuptial crests.
*&quot;N. a. auritum&quot; (Lesson, 1831), the nominate subspecies, has the largest and most widespread breeding population. It ranges from the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains east into central and eastern North America. This region includes the Canadian prairies and the Great Lakes. Historically, this subspecies has bred in abundance across most of this region, though there are questions as to whether this bird has always bred in the Great Lakes region. Some evidence indicates that the bird has only begun breeding in the region since the early 20th century while other evidence suggests that it has been breeding in the region much longer. Physically, this subspecies is moderately large and has black nuptial crests.
*&quot;N. a. cincinnatum&quot; (Brandt 1837), white-crested cormorant, currently this is the most geographically restricted subspecies with the smallest population. It is found along the southern coast of Alaska and on the Aleutian Islands, ranging west from Kodiak to Chuginidak in the Aleutians. Historically, the range extended west to the Near Islands, but possibly due to nest predation by introduced foxes, the birds were no longer breeding in the area by the mid-1930s. Physically, this subspecies is the largest and it bears straight, white nuptial crests.
*&quot;N. a. floridanum&quot; (Audubon 1835), Florida cormorant, the smallest of the five subspecies, it is found from southern and central Texas east to the Atlantic and from North Carolina south to Florida. Records indicate that this subspecies was abundant throughout its range before the 20th century, but now is only abundant in Florida. This bird has dark nuptial crests.
*&quot;N. a. heuretum&quot; This subspecies bears straight, white nuptial crests. Physically, it is the smallest. It has bare lores and a greenish gloss on the head and neck. It breeds only in the mangroves surrounding interior lakes of San Salvador in the Bahamas. It may also be resident on other Bahamian islands.

==Description==
The double-crested cormorant is a large waterbird with a stocky body, long neck, medium-sized tail, webbed feet, and a medium-sized hooked bill. It has a body length of between long, with a wingspan of between . Double-crested cormorants weigh between . Males and females do not display sexual dimorphism.

This species has dark-colored plumage with bare supra-loreal skin and gular skin that is yellow or orange. An adult in breeding plumage will be mostly black with the back and coverts being a dark grayish towards the center. Nuptial crests, for which the species is named, are either white, black or a mix of the two. These are located just above the eyes with the bare skin on the face of a breeding adult being orange. A non-breeding adult will lack the crests and have more yellowish skin around the face. The bill of the adult is dark-colored. The double-crested cormorant is very similar in appearance to the larger great cormorant, which has a more restricted distribution in North America, mainly on the Canadian maritime provinces; it can, however, be separated by having more yellow on the throat and the bill. The neotropic cormorant also looks very similar, and the two species can sometimes be found together where their ranges meet.

The plumage of juvenile double-crested cormorants is more dark gray or brownish. The underparts of a juvenile are lighter than the back with a pale throat and breast that darkens towards the belly. As a bird ages, its plumage will grow darker. The bill of a juvenile will be mostly orange or yellowish.

==Distribution and habitat==
A very common and widespread species, it winters anywhere that is ice-free along both coasts, as far north as southern Alaska (on the west coast) and southern New England (on the east coast). It can be found as far south as Mexico and the Bahamas. It migrates from the coldest parts of its breeding range, such as eastern Canada, and has occurred in Europe as a very rare vagrant, for example in Great Britain, Ireland, and the Azores.

It is resident on Pacific Coast from Aleutian Islands south to Nayarit, Mexico (but excluding parts of British Columbia and the Southern California Bight) and inland to the Colorado River, resident on Atlantic Coast in Long Island and surrounding areas, southern New England, Florida, Cuba, and Yucatán Peninsula. Its breeding range extends north throughout most of north-central North America, from Utah north to Alberta east through the Great Lakes states to Nova Scotia, and south to northern Massachusetts, along with parts of Alaska adjoining Bristol and Kuskokwim Bays. Its nonbreeding range extends throughout all coastal plains in the US, including the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains south to Campeche, as well as the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Cayman Islands, along with all areas previously stated to be resident. On the Pacific Coast, range includes all areas previously mentioned to be resident, along with British Columbia and the Southern California Bight.

==Behavior==

The double-crested cormorant swims low in the water, often with just its neck and head visible, and dives from the surface. It uses its feet for propulsion and is able to dive to a depth of for 30–70 seconds. After diving, it spends long periods standing with its wings outstretched to allow them to dry, since they are not fully waterproofed. This species flies low over the water, with its bill tilted slightly upward, sometimes leaving the colony in long, single-file lines.

===Diet===

Food can be found in the sea, freshwater lakes, and rivers. Like all cormorants, the double-crested dives to find its prey. It mainly eats fish, but will sometimes also eat amphibians, crustaceans and insects. Fish are caught by diving under water. Smaller fish may be eaten while the bird is still beneath the surface but bigger prey is often brought to the surface before it is eaten. Double-crested cormorants are also considered pests to aquaculturists because of their intense predation on fish ponds which can cause thousands of dollars in losses to farmers. 
Cormorants regurgitate pellets containing undigested parts of their meals such as bones. These pellets can be dissected by biologists in order to discover what the birds ate.

===Breeding===
Breeding occurs in coastal areas as well as near inland rivers and lakes. They build stick nests in trees, on cliff edges, or on the ground on suitable islands. They are gregarious birds usually found in colonies, often with other aquatic birds, and have a deep, guttural grunt call.

==Recovery==
The double-crested cormorant&#x27;s numbers decreased in the 1960s due to the effects of DDT. Colonies have also been persecuted from time to time in areas where they are thought to compete with human fishing.

Recently the population of double-crested cormorants has increased. Some studies have concluded that the recovery was allowed by the decrease of contaminants, particularly the discontinued use of DDT. The population may have also increased because of aquaculture ponds in its southern wintering grounds. The ponds favor good over-winter survival and growth.

In 1894, Thomas McIlwraith in his book, &quot;Birds of Ontario&quot;, concludes his section on double-crested cormorants by saying: &quot;When the young are sufficiently grown, they gather into immense flocks in unfrequented sections, and remain until the ice-lid has closed over their food supply, when they go away, not to return till the cover is lifted up in the spring.&quot;

For populations nesting in the Great Lakes region, it is believed that the colonization of the lakes by the non-native alewife (a small prey fish) has provided optimal feeding conditions and hence good breeding success. Double-crested cormorants eat other species of fish besides alewives and have been suspected of contributing to the decline of some sport-fish populations in the Great Lakes and other areas.

In light of this belief, and because of calls for action by the public, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (the U.S. federal government agency charged with their protection) has recently extended control options to some other government entities. This includes culling of populations and measures to thwart reproduction, in an effort to control their growing numbers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service retains oversight and the control measures are not extended to the general public (no hunting season).

In May 2008, the Canadian government reduced significantly the number of nests of the birds on Middle Island, a small island in Lake Erie and part of Point Pelee National Park. This is an attempt to keep the small island in balance and preserve its vegetation but opponents to the plan have argued that it is based on faulty information, provided in part by anglers who view cormorants as competitors. As of 2021, the cormorant culling program continues.

<text>A bashi-bazouk ( , , , roughly &quot;leaderless&quot; or &quot;disorderly&quot;) was an irregular soldier of the Ottoman army, raised in times of war. The army primarily enlisted Albanians and sometimes Circassians as bashi-bazouks, but recruits came from all ethnic groups of the Ottoman Empire, including slaves from Europe or Africa. Bashi-bazouks had a reputation for being undisciplined and brutal, notorious for looting and preying on civilians as a result of a lack of regulation and of the expectation that they would support themselves off the land.

==Origin and history==
Although the Ottoman armies always contained irregular troops such as mercenaries as well as regular soldiers, the strain on the Ottoman feudal system, caused mainly by the Empire&#x27;s wide expanse, required a heavier reliance on irregular soldiers. They were armed and maintained by the government, but did not receive pay and did not wear uniforms or distinctive badges. They were motivated to fight mostly by expectations of plunder. Though the majority of troops fought on foot, some troops (called &quot;aḳıncı&quot;) rode on horseback. Because of their lack of discipline, they were not capable of undertaking major military operations, but were useful for other tasks such as reconnaissance and outpost duty. However, their uncertain temper occasionally made it necessary for the Ottoman regular troops to disarm them by force.

The Ottoman army consisted of the following:
* The Sultan&#x27;s household troops, called &quot;Kapıkulu&quot;, which were salaried, most notable being Janissary corps.
* Provincial soldiers, which were fiefed (Turkish &quot;Tımarlı&quot;), the most important being &quot;Timarli Sipahi&quot; (lit. &quot;fiefed cavalry&quot;) and their retainers (called &quot;cebelu&quot; lit. armed, man-at-arms), but other kinds were also present
* Soldiers of subject, protectorate, or allied states (the most important being the Crimean Khans)
* Bashi-bazouks, who usually did not receive regular salaries and lived off loot
Many Afro-Turks, Albanians, Crimean Tatars, Muslim Roma, and Pomaks were bashi-bazouks in Rumelia.

An attempt by Koca Hüsrev Mehmed Pasha to disband his Albanian bashi-bazouks in favor of his regular forces began the rioting which led to the establishment of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Khedivate of Egypt. The use of bashi-bazouks was abandoned by the end of the 19th century. However, self-organized bashi-bazouk troops still appeared later.

The term &quot;bashibozouk&quot; has also been used for a mounted force, existing in peacetime in various provinces of the Ottoman Empire, which performed the duties of gendarmerie.

==Reputation and atrocities==

The bashi-bazouks were notorious for being violently brutal and undisciplined, thus giving the term its second, colloquial meaning of &quot;undisciplined bandit&quot; in many languages. The term was popularised in the 20th century by the comic series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, where the word is frequently used as an insult by Captain Haddock.

The Batak massacre (1876) was carried out by thousands of bashi-bazouks sent to quell a local rebellion. Likewise, bashi-bazouks perpetrated the massacres of Candia in 1898 and Phocaea in 1914. During the 1903 Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising in Ottoman Macedonia, these troops burned 119 villages and destroyed 8400 houses, and over 50,000 Bulgarian refugees had to flee into the mountains.

<text>Phalacrocorax is a genus of fish-eating birds in the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. Members of this genus are also known as the Old World cormorants.

== Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the great cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;) as the type species. &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; is the Latin word for a cormorant.

Formerly, many other species of cormorant were classified in &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but most of these have been split out into different genera. A 2014 study found &quot;Phalacrocrax&quot; to be the sister genus to &quot;Urile&quot;, which are thought to have split from each other between 8.9 - 10.3 million years ago.

=== Current taxonomy ===
A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; contains 12 species. This taxonomy was adopted by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International, and later by the IOC.









=== Alternative taxonomies ===
Formerly, the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; often included all members of the family Phalacrocoracidae. More recently, some authorities, such as the Clements checklist, recognized &quot;Microcarbo&quot; as distinct (due to its morphological distinctiveness and the old age of its split from the remaining cormorants), while retaining all other cormorants in a still-broad &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;. The IOC checklist went a step further in recognizing &quot;Leucocarbo&quot; as well as &quot;Microcarbo&quot; as distinct (while retaining the rest in &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;), but this treatment rendered &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; paraphyletic (with some members much more closely related to &quot;Leucocarbo&quot; than others). Nowadays, due to the age of the splits between different cormorant clades, most authorities, including the aforementioned two checklists, now recognize seven cormorant genera: &quot;Microcarbo&quot;, &quot;Poikilocarbo&quot;, &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, &quot;Urile&quot;, &quot;Gulosus&quot;, &quot;Nannopterum&quot;, and &quot;Leucocarbo&quot;.

<doc id="215236" wikidata="Q1091433" url="?curid=215236" title="Pisces Iscariot">
<text>Pisces Iscariot is a compilation album by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released in 1994 through Virgin Records, consisting of B-sides and outtakes. Reaching number 4 in the US upon its 1994 release, &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA on November 23, 1994. The album was initially to be called &quot;Neptulius&quot;.

The album was re-released by EMI as a deluxe edition CD and LP on July 17, 2012.

== Packaging ==
The CD, LP, and cassette issues were each released with unique cover artwork. The US vinyl release was pressed on amber vinyl, and the first 2,000 copies included a bonus 7-inch single with &quot;Not Worth Asking&quot; from the original &quot;I Am One&quot; 7-inch, backed with &quot;Honeyspider II&quot;. The UK LP has identical artwork to its US counterpart, although the printing is much lighter and the inner sleeve is a heavier stock.

== Reception ==
According to a December 1, 1994, review by Al Weisel, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; doesn&#x27;t really sound like the compilation of rejects it actually is. In fact, it&#x27;s better than a lot of albums that bands labored hard to put together. Although definitely not the Pumpkins&#x27; best album, it&#x27;s more varied, if less cohesive, than &quot;Gish&quot; or &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave 3 out of 5 stars to the album.

==Deluxe release==
In 2012, EMI released a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; that included a cassette tape with the first Smashing Pumpkins demo tape on it. The deluxe version of &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; is listed by Spotify under the band&#x27;s main &quot;album&quot; section (along with its studio albums), rather than in the &quot;compilations&quot; section. According to Ian Cohen, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Pisces Iscariot is painstakingly sequenced to maintain a concept record&#x27;s sonic peaks and valleys, favoring stylistic cohesion over protracted diversity. Its ratio of sweet acoustic strummers, barnstorming riff-rockers, and expansive guitar freakouts is balanced almost exactly akin to that of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; or &quot;Gish&quot;. It still works as an album if you want it to, meaning it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;Incesticide&quot; or &quot;Masterplan&quot; as far as alt-rock cash-ins go.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; among its &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. For the 20th anniversary of the album, Ryan Leas, writing for &quot;Stereogum&quot;, commented that &quot;[e]very now and then, a band releases a collection of B-sides and outtakes and otherwise semi-available material that transcends the notion of an artist emptying the vaults to buy a bit of time between full-fledged albums, or simply trying to cash in a bit... Of the already anomalous nature of these odds-and-ends turned important touchstones in an artist’s catalog, &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; is amongst an even rarer category: the very early vault emptying that results in a shockingly strong collection of lesser or entirely unknown songs. So shockingly strong, in fact, that an album like &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; is often placed head and shoulders above almost anything Billy Corgan did after, save the following year&#x27;s monolithic &quot;Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness&quot;.&quot;

<text>Lull is an EP by American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released in 1991.

== Background ==

&quot;Rhinoceros&quot; was taken from &quot;Gish&quot; (but the feedback ending is cut here), &quot;Blue&quot; later appeared on &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; and an acoustic version later appeared on the bonus disc for the 2011 reissue of &quot;Gish.&quot; A live version of &quot;Slunk&quot; later appeared on &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; and its soundtrack album &quot;Earphoria&quot; with alternate lyrics (the line &quot;Sister above&quot; is changed to &quot;You talk shit like a chump&quot;). As well, a demo version of &quot;Slunk&quot; exists with Jimmy Chamberlin on vocals with alternate lyrics called &quot;Chump&quot;, (the line &quot;Sister above&quot; is changed to &quot;You suck dick like a chump&quot;). &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Slunk&quot; were outtakes from the &quot;Gish&quot; sessions.

&quot;Bye June&quot; is a 1989 recording from the &quot;Reel Time Studio Sessions&quot;, originally released on the &quot;Moon&quot; demo.

The liner notes include partial lyrics for the song &quot;Obscured&quot;, written in cake frosting like the album cover. The song would eventually be released as a B-side on the single for &quot;Today&quot; in 1993 and then on the B-side collection &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; in 1994. &quot;Obscured&quot; was originally intended by Billy Corgan to be on &quot;Lull&quot; but was dropped for reasons that are unclear.

In the liner notes for &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;, Corgan wrote:

<text>In computer programming, Base64 (also known as tetrasexagesimal) is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that transforms binary data into a sequence of printable characters, limited to a set of 64 unique characters. More specifically, the source binary data is taken 6 bits at a time, then this group of 6 bits is mapped to one of 64 unique characters.

As with all binary-to-text encoding schemes, Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary formats across channels that only reliably support text content. Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web where one of its uses is the ability to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.

Base64 is also widely used for sending e-mail attachments, because SMTP – in its original form – was designed to transport 7-bit ASCII characters only. Encoding an attachment as Base64 before sending, and then decoding when received, assures older SMTP servers will not interfere with the attachment. 

Base64 encoding causes an overhead of 33–37% relative to the size of the original binary data (33% by the encoding itself; up to 4% more by the inserted line breaks).

==Design==
The particular set of 64 characters chosen to represent the 64-digit values for the base varies between implementations. The general strategy is to choose 64 characters that are common to most encodings and that are also printable. This combination leaves the data unlikely to be modified in transit through information systems, such as email, that were traditionally not 8-bit clean. For example, MIME&#x27;s Base64 implementation uses codice_1–codice_2, codice_3–codice_4, and codice_5–codice_6 for the first 62 values. Other variations share this property but differ in the symbols chosen for the last two values; an example is UTF-7.

The earliest instances of this type of encoding were created for dial-up communication between systems running the same OS – for example, uuencode for UNIX and BinHex for the TRS-80 (later adapted for the Macintosh) – and could therefore make more assumptions about what characters were safe to use. For instance, uuencode uses uppercase letters, digits, and many punctuation characters, but no lowercase.

==Base64 table from RFC 4648==
This is the Base64 alphabet defined in RFC 4648 §4 . See also .

==Examples==
The example below uses ASCII text for simplicity, but this is not a typical use case, as it can already be safely transferred across all systems that can handle Base64. The more typical use is to encode binary data (such as an image); the resulting Base64 data will only contain 64 different ASCII characters, all of which can reliably be transferred across systems that may corrupt the raw source bytes.

Here is a well-known idiom from distributed computing:

When the quote (without trailing whitespace) is encoded into Base64, it is represented as a byte sequence of 8-bit-padded ASCII characters encoded in MIME&#x27;s Base64 scheme as follows (newlines and white spaces may be present anywhere but are to be ignored on decoding):

In the above quote, the encoded value of &quot;Man&quot; is &quot;TWFu&quot;. Encoded in ASCII, the characters &quot;M&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; are stored as the byte values codice_7, codice_8, and codice_9, which are the 8-bit binary values codice_10, codice_11, and codice_12. These three values are joined together into a 24-bit string, producing codice_13. Groups of 6 bits (6 bits have a maximum of 26 = 64 different binary values) are converted into individual numbers from start to end (in this case, there are four numbers in a 24-bit string), which are then converted into their corresponding Base64 character values.

As this example illustrates, Base64 encoding converts three octets into four encoded characters.

codice_14 padding characters might be added to make the last encoded block contain four Base64 characters.

Hexadecimal to octal transformation is useful to convert between binary and Base64. Such conversion is available for both advanced calculators and programming languages. For example, the hexadecimal representation of the 24 bits above is 4D616E. The octal representation is 23260556. Those 8 octal digits can be split into pairs (), and each pair is converted to decimal to yield . Using those four decimal numbers as indices for the Base64 alphabet, the corresponding ASCII characters are &quot;TWFu&quot;.

If there are only two significant input octets (e.g., &#x27;Ma&#x27;), or when the last input group contains only two octets, all 16 bits will be captured in the first three Base64 digits (18 bits); the two least significant bits of the last content-bearing 6-bit block will turn out to be zero, and discarded on decoding (along with the succeeding codice_14 padding character):

If there is only one significant input octet (e.g., &#x27;M&#x27;), or when the last input group contains only one octet, all 8 bits will be captured in the first two Base64 digits (12 bits); the four least significant bits of the last content-bearing 6-bit block will turn out to be zero, and discarded on decoding (along with the succeeding two codice_14 padding characters):

===Output padding===
Because Base64 is a six-bit encoding, and because the decoded values are divided into 8-bit octets, every four characters of Base64-encoded text (4 sextets = = 24 bits) represents three octets of unencoded text or data (3 octets = = 24 bits). This means that when the length of the unencoded input is not a multiple of three, the encoded output must have padding added so that its length is a multiple of four. The padding character is codice_14, which indicates that no further bits are needed to fully encode the input. (This is different from codice_1, which means that the remaining bits are all zeros.) The example below illustrates how truncating the input of the above quote changes the output padding:


The padding character is not essential for decoding, since the number of missing bytes can be inferred from the length of the encoded text. In some implementations, the padding character is mandatory, while for others it is not used. An exception in which padding characters are required is when multiple Base64 encoded files have been concatenated.

===Decoding Base64 with padding===
When decoding Base64 text, four characters are typically converted back to three bytes. The only exceptions are when padding characters exist. A single codice_14 indicates that the four characters will decode to only two bytes, while codice_20 indicates that the four characters will decode to only a single byte. For example:
Another way to interpret the padding character is to consider it as an instruction to discard 2 trailing bits from the bit string each time a codice_14 is encountered. For example, when `` is decoded, we convert each character (except the trailing occurrences of codice_14) into their corresponding 6-bit representation, and then discard 2 trailing bits for the first codice_14 and another 2 trailing bits for the other codice_14. In this instance, we would get 6 bits from the codice_25, and another 6 bits from the codice_26 for a bit string of length 12, but since we remove 2 bits for each codice_14 (for a total of 4 bits), the codice_28 ends up producing 8 bits (1 byte) when decoded.

===Decoding Base64 without padding===
Without padding, after normal decoding of four characters to three bytes over and over again, fewer than four encoded characters may remain. In this situation, only two or three characters can remain. A single remaining encoded character is not possible, because a single Base64 character only contains 6 bits, and 8 bits are required to create a byte, so a minimum of two Base64 characters are required: The first character contributes 6 bits, and the second character contributes its first 2 bits. For example:

Decoding without padding is not performed consistently among decoders. In addition, allowing padless decoding by definition allows multiple strings to decode into the same set of bytes, which can be a security risk.

==Implementations and history==
===Variants summary table===
Implementations may have some constraints on the alphabet used for representing some bit patterns. This notably concerns the last two characters used in the alphabet at positions 62 and 63, and the character used for padding (which may be mandatory in some protocols or removed in others). The table below summarizes these known variants and provides links to the subsections below.

===Privacy-enhanced mail===
The first known standardized use of the encoding now called MIME Base64 was in the Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) protocol, proposed by in 1987. PEM defines a &quot;printable encoding&quot; scheme that uses Base64 encoding to transform an arbitrary sequence of octets to a format that can be expressed in short lines of 6-bit characters, as required by transfer protocols such as SMTP.

The current version of PEM (specified in ) uses a 64-character alphabet consisting of upper- and lower-case Roman letters (codice_1–codice_2, codice_3–codice_4), the numerals (codice_5–codice_6), and the codice_35 and codice_36 symbols. The codice_14 symbol is also used as a padding suffix. The original specification, , additionally used the codice_38 symbol to delimit encoded but unencrypted data within the output stream.

To convert data to PEM printable encoding, the first byte is placed in the most significant eight bits of a 24-bit buffer, the next in the middle eight, and the third in the least significant eight bits. If there are fewer than three bytes left to encode (or in total), the remaining buffer bits will be zero. The buffer is then used, six bits at a time, most significant first, as indices into the string: &quot;codice_39&quot;, and the indicated character is output.

The process is repeated on the remaining data until fewer than four octets remain. If three octets remain, they are processed normally. If fewer than three octets (24 bits) are remaining to encode, the input data is right-padded with zero bits to form an integral multiple of six bits.

After encoding the non-padded data, if two octets of the 24-bit buffer are padded-zeros, two codice_14 characters are appended to the output; if one octet of the 24-bit buffer is filled with padded-zeros, one codice_14 character is appended. This signals the decoder that the zero bits added due to padding should be excluded from the reconstructed data. This also guarantees that the encoded output length is a multiple of 4 bytes.

PEM requires that all encoded lines consist of exactly 64 printable characters, with the exception of the last line, which may contain fewer printable characters. Lines are delimited by whitespace characters according to local (platform-specific) conventions.

===MIME===
The MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) specification lists Base64 as one of two binary-to-text encoding schemes (the other being quoted-printable). MIME&#x27;s Base64 encoding is based on that of the version of PEM: it uses the same 64-character alphabet and encoding mechanism as PEM and uses the codice_14 symbol for output padding in the same way, as described at .

MIME does not specify a fixed length for Base64-encoded lines, but it does specify a maximum line length of 76 characters. Additionally, it specifies that any character outside the standard set of 64 encoding characters (For example CRLF sequences), must be ignored by a compliant decoder, although most implementations use a CR/LF newline pair to delimit encoded lines.

Thus, the actual length of MIME-compliant Base64-encoded binary data is usually about 137% of the original data length (×), though for very short messages the overhead can be much higher due to the overhead of the headers. Very roughly, the final size of Base64-encoded binary data is equal to 1.37 times the original data size + 814 bytes (for headers). The size of the decoded data can be approximated with this formula:
 bytes = (string_length(encoded_string) − 814) / 1.37

===UTF-7===

UTF-7, described first in , which was later superseded by , introduced a system called &quot;modified Base64&quot;. This data encoding scheme is used to encode UTF-16 as ASCII characters for use in 7-bit transports such as SMTP. It is a variant of the Base64 encoding used in MIME.

The &quot;Modified Base64&quot; alphabet consists of the MIME Base64 alphabet, but does not use the &quot;codice_14&quot; padding character. UTF-7 is intended for use in mail headers (defined in ), and the &quot;codice_14&quot; character is reserved in that context as the escape character for &quot;quoted-printable&quot; encoding. Modified Base64 simply omits the padding and ends immediately after the last Base64 digit containing useful bits leaving up to three unused bits in the last Base64 digit.

===OpenPGP===

OpenPGP, described in , specifies &quot;ASCII armor&quot;, which is identical to the &quot;Base64&quot; encoding described by MIME, with the addition of an optional 24-bit CRC. The checksum is calculated on the input data before encoding; the checksum is then encoded with the same Base64 algorithm and, prefixed by the &quot;codice_14&quot; symbol as the separator, appended to the encoded output data.

===RFC 3548===
, entitled &quot;The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings&quot;, is an informational (non-normative) memo that attempts to unify the and specifications of Base64 encodings, alternative-alphabet encodings, and the Base32 (which is seldom used) and Base16 encodings.

Unless implementations are written to a specification that refers to and specifically requires otherwise, RFC 3548 forbids implementations from generating messages containing characters outside the encoding alphabet or without padding, and it also declares that decoder implementations must reject data that contain characters outside the encoding alphabet.

===RFC 4648===
 obsoletes and focuses on Base64/32/16:

: &quot;This document describes the commonly used Base64, Base32, and Base16 encoding schemes. It also discusses the use of line feeds in encoded data, the use of padding in encoded data, the use of non-alphabet characters in encoded data, use of different encoding alphabets, and canonical encodings.&quot;

===URL applications===
Base64 encoding can be helpful when fairly lengthy identifying information is used in an HTTP environment. For example, a database persistence framework for Java objects might use Base64 encoding to encode a relatively large unique id (generally 128-bit UUIDs) into a string for use as an HTTP parameter in HTTP forms or HTTP GET URLs. Also, many applications need to encode binary data in a way that is convenient for inclusion in URLs, including in hidden web form fields, and Base64 is a convenient encoding to render them in a compact way.

Using standard Base64 in URL requires encoding of &#x27;codice_35&#x27;, &#x27;codice_36&#x27; and &#x27;codice_14&#x27; characters into special percent-encoded hexadecimal sequences (&#x27;codice_35&#x27; becomes &#x27;codice_50&#x27;, &#x27;codice_36&#x27; becomes &#x27;codice_52&#x27; and &#x27;codice_14&#x27; becomes &#x27;codice_54&#x27;), which makes the string unnecessarily longer.

For this reason, modified Base64 for URL variants exist (such as base64url in ), where the &#x27;codice_35&#x27; and &#x27;codice_36&#x27; characters of standard Base64 are respectively replaced by &#x27;codice_57&#x27; and &#x27;codice_58&#x27;, so that using URL encoders/decoders is no longer necessary and has no effect on the length of the encoded value, leaving the same encoded form intact for use in relational databases, web forms, and object identifiers in general. A popular site to make use of such is YouTube. Some variants allow or require omitting the padding &#x27;codice_14&#x27; signs to avoid them being confused with field separators, or require that any such padding be percent-encoded. Some libraries will encode &#x27;codice_14&#x27; to &#x27;codice_61&#x27;, potentially exposing applications to relative path attacks when a folder name is encoded from user data.

===Javascript (DOM Web API) ===
The codice_62 and codice_63 JavaScript methods, defined in the HTML5 draft specification, provide Base64 encoding and decoding functionality to web pages. The codice_63 method outputs padding characters, but these are optional in the input of the codice_62 method.

===Other applications===

Base64 can be used in a variety of contexts:

* Base64 can be used to transmit and store text that might otherwise cause delimiter collision
* Base64 is used to encode character strings in LDAP Data Interchange Format files
* Base64 is often used to embed binary data in an XML file, using a syntax similar to codice_66 e.g. favicons in Firefox&#x27;s exported codice_67.
* Base64 is used to encode binary files such as images within scripts, to avoid depending on external files.
* Base64 can be used to embed PDF files in HTML pages.
* The data URI scheme can use Base64 to represent file contents. For instance, background images and fonts can be specified in a CSS stylesheet file as codice_68 URIs, instead of being supplied in separate files.
* Although not part of the official specification for the SVG format, some viewers can interpret Base64 when used for embedded elements, such as raster images inside SVG files.
* Base64 can be used to store/transmit relatively small amounts of binary data via a computer&#x27;s text clipboard functionality, especially in cases where the information doesn&#x27;t warrant being permanently saved or when information must be quickly sent between a wide variety of different, potentially incompatible programs. An example is the representation of the public keys of cryptocurrency recipients as Base64 encoded text strings, which can be easily copied and pasted into users&#x27; wallet software. 
* Binary data that must be quickly verified by humans as a safety mechanism, such as file checksums or key fingerprints, is often represented in Base64 for easy checking, sometimes with additional formattings, such as separating each group of four characters in the representation of a PGP key fingerprint with a space. 
* QR codes which contain binary data will sometimes store it encoded in Base64 rather than simply storing the raw binary data, as there is a stronger guarantee that all QR code readers will accurately decode text, as well as the fact that some devices will more readily save text from a QR code than potentially malicious binary data.

=== Applications not compatible with RFC 4648 Base64 ===
Some applications use a Base64 alphabet that is significantly different from the alphabets used in the most common Base64 variants (see Variants summary table above).

* The Uuencoding alphabet includes no lowercase characters, instead using ASCII codes 32 (&quot;codice_69&quot; (space)) through 95 (&quot;codice_58&quot;), consecutively. Uuencoding uses the alphabet &quot;codice_71&quot;. Avoiding all lower-case letters was helpful, because many older printers only printed uppercase. Using consecutive ASCII characters saved computing power, because it was only necessary to add 32, without requiring a lookup table. Its use of most punctuation characters and the space character may limit its usefulness in some applications, such as those that use these characters as syntax.
* BinHex 4 (HQX), which was used within the classic Mac OS, excludes some visually confusable characters like &#x27;codice_72&#x27;, &#x27;codice_73&#x27;, &#x27;codice_74&#x27; and &#x27;codice_75&#x27;. Its alphabet includes additional punctuation characters. It uses the alphabet &quot;codice_76&quot;.
* A UTF-8 environment can use non-synchronized continuation bytes as base64: codice_77. See UTF-8#Self-synchronization.
* Several other applications use alphabets similar to the common variations, but in a different order:
** Unix stores password hashes computed with crypt in the codice_78 file using an encoding called B64. crypt&#x27;s alphabet puts the punctuation codice_61 and codice_36 before the alphanumeric characters. crypt uses the alphabet &quot;codice_81&quot; without padding. An advantage over RFC 4648 is that sorting encoded ASCII data results in the same order as sorting the plain ASCII data.
** The GEDCOM 5.5 standard for genealogical data interchange encodes multimedia files in its text-line hierarchical file format. GEDCOM uses the same alphabet as crypt, which is &quot;codice_81&quot;.
** bcrypt hashes are designed to be used in the same way as traditional crypt(3) hashes, but bcrypt&#x27;s alphabet is in a different order than crypt&#x27;s. bcrypt uses the alphabet &quot;codice_83&quot;.
** Xxencoding uses a mostly-alphanumeric character set similar to crypt, but using codice_35 and codice_57 rather than codice_61 and codice_36. Xxencoding uses the alphabet &quot;codice_88&quot;.
** 6PACK, used with some terminal node controllers, uses an alphabet from 0x00 to 0x3f.
** Bash supports numeric literals in Base64. Bash uses the alphabet &quot;codice_89&quot;.

<text>Siamese Dream is the second studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on July 27, 1993, by Virgin Records. The album was produced by Butch Vig and frontman Billy Corgan. Despite its recording sessions being fraught with difficulties and tensions, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; debuted at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was eventually certified 4× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the album selling over six million copies worldwide, catapulting the Smashing Pumpkins to mainstream success and cementing them as a significant group in alternative music.

Four singles were released in support of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;: &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Disarm&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&quot;, and a fifth single, &quot;Mayonaise&quot;, was released in 2023 for the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The album received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, with its diverse musical influences and lyrical material considered unique compared to other releases during the alternative rock and grunge movements of its time. The album has since been considered &quot;one of the finest alternative rock albums&quot;, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and of all time.

== Background ==

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Gish&quot;, was released on Caroline Records in 1991 to unexpected success and acclaim. After the release of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; later that year, the Smashing Pumpkins were hyped as &quot;the next Nirvana&quot;. The band was signed to Caroline Records parent Virgin Records and began recording a follow-up album. Frontman Billy Corgan felt &quot;this great pressure to make the next album to set the world on fire&quot;. The immense pressure to succeed intensified an already problematic situation: drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was addicted to heroin, guitarist James Iha and bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky had recently ended their romantic relationship, and Corgan, aside from battles with weight gain and suicidal depression, was struggling with writer&#x27;s block.

== Recording and production ==

&quot;Siamese Dream&quot; was recorded mainly between December 1992 and March 1993. The band relocated to Triclops Studios in Marietta, Georgia for the album sessions, so they could avoid local friends and distractions, and to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. Butch Vig reprised his role as producer after working on their debut album &quot;Gish&quot;. Butch Vig stated &quot;Billy [Corgan] and I raised the bar really high. We wanted to make a very ambitious sounding record. It was all done on analogue tape so it was time consuming. We were working 12 hours a day, six times a week for about three months, and for the last two months we worked seven days a week, 14 or 15 hours a day because we were behind schedule.&quot;

After he suffered a nervous breakdown, Corgan began visiting a therapist. Consequently, his lyrics became more explicit about his troubled past and his insecurities. &quot;Today&quot; was one of the first songs written by Corgan for &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. He played the self-recorded demo to Vig, and received a positive reaction. Soon afterward, executives from Virgin Records came to observe the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo and did not soon return to the studio. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan. Corgan worked overtime, practically living in the studio for the recording of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;—he and Vig would sometimes work on a 45-second section of music for two days, working 16-hour days for weeks at a time to achieve the sound Corgan wanted.

Corgan&#x27;s desire for musical perfection put further strain on the already-frayed relationships between the band members. Vig later recalled, &quot;D&#x27;arcy would lock herself in the bathroom, James wouldn&#x27;t say anything, or Billy would lock himself in the control room&quot;. Corgan often overdubbed Iha&#x27;s and Wretzky&#x27;s parts with his own playing. Wretzky stated that Corgan only performed most of the guitar and bass parts because he could lay them down more easily in recording and with far fewer takes. Stories of the album&#x27;s recording had circulated in the music press. Corgan admitted there was some truth to accusations of tyrannical behavior, though he felt the press misunderstood the situation.

While Chamberlin performed all drum parts on the album, he would disappear for days on drug benders that caused everyone to fear for his life. After one incident where the drummer had disappeared for two or three days, Corgan &quot;put the hammer down&quot;, according to Vig, and had Chamberlin perform the drum part for &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; until his hands bled. Due to Corgan&#x27;s urging, Chamberlin checked into a rehab clinic. Corgan told &quot;Spin&quot; later that year, &quot;You know, I gave them a year and a half to prepare for this record... I&#x27;m surrounded by these people who I care about very much, yet they continue to keep failing me.&quot; Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, &quot;If you really think about it, of course, someone doesn&#x27;t do the job because they&#x27;re lazy, or they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s important. But I took it as, &#x27;You&#x27;re not worth going home and working on the song.&#x27;&quot;

Meanwhile, Corgan was also going through his own problems. He would admit in 2011 that throughout the recording process he had been planning his own suicide. Stating that he had gotten rid of most of his things and was &quot;fantasizing about my own death, I started thinking what my funeral would be like and what music would be played.&quot;

Virgin began to grow impatient with the album&#x27;s recording as it went over budget and became behind schedule. The band, however, would not let the label cut corners if it meant compromising the sound. By the time recording was completed, Corgan and Vig felt too emotionally exhausted to mix the record. Corgan suggested that engineer Alan Moulder mix the album, due to his work on &quot;Loveless&quot; by My Bloody Valentine. Moulder booked two weeks in a studio to mix the album; the mix ended up taking 36 days to complete. Eventually, the album was finished after four months and $250,000 over budget.

== Composition and lyrics ==

The album boasts relatively high production values and ornate arrangements compared to other early-1990s alternative albums. Vig said, &quot;Billy wanted to make a record that people would put on and say, &#x27;What the fuck was that?&#x27; [...] We wanted to have things going on in the left ear and right ear all the time&quot;. One of Corgan&#x27;s main goals was to create a sense of sonic depth, but, as Corgan said, &quot;without necessarily using delays or reverbs—to use tonalities instead.&quot; For the album, the guitars were layered multiple times. Corgan has stated that &quot;Soma&quot; alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts. Vig stated that as many as 100 guitar parts were compressed into a single song.

The album, generally considered alternative rock, has many different musical influences, including shoegaze, dream pop, and heavy metal, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noting that the album was &quot;closer to progressive rock than to punk or grunge.&quot;

The subjects of Corgan&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; varied. Corgan noted that most of his lyrics for the album were about his girlfriend and future ex-wife Chris Fabian, with whom he had briefly broken up at the time he wrote the songs. Corgan occasionally wrote about other subjects. In &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, Corgan attacked the American music industry, and &quot;Today&quot; is about a day that he was experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts. &quot;Spaceboy&quot; was written as a tribute to his half-brother, Jesse.

== Artwork and packaging ==

The artwork for the album was initially going to be created by an outsider artist, but after a series of disagreements with the label, Corgan was forced to step in at the last minute. The album booklet, composed of old photographs of both strangers and Corgan&#x27;s family members with lyrics handwritten on top, was assembled by Corgan and his wife the day after their wedding. Corgan was not satisfied with the results. The first pressing of the CD contained a 20-page booklet, with a separate page devoted to each song&#x27;s lyrics and accompanying photograph; later pressings contained a four-panel fold-out liner with thumbnails of each picture. In 1999, Virgin Records reissued the album with the original 20-page booklet.

Shortly after the Pumpkins reformed in 2007, Corgan posted a message to the band&#x27;s blog saying that they were &quot;[l]ooking for girls from &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; album cover... As you all know, they were quite young when the photo was taken. They are not conjoined anymore, as far as we know.&quot; The band&#x27;s intentions for the search were never made clear. In February 2011, Billy Corgan announced via Twitter that not only had one of the girls been found, she was the current bassist for the Pumpkins, Nicole Fiorentino. According to Corgan, &quot;Just found out the weirdest news: our bass player Nicole just admitted she is one of the girls on the cover of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;.&quot; However, according to the assistant photographer for &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, the cover photo was probably shot specifically for the album. Given Fiorentino&#x27;s age at the time of the album, this would make her too old to be on the cover of the album. It was later confirmed that the information was false, and both girls were located in 2008, though Corgan has not commented on this. Pictures exist of Corgan standing with Ali Laenger, the girl on the right side of the photograph.

The album was also released as a shaped wooden box set (aka &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; Collectors Edition) with metal hinges, limited to only 1,000 copies and containing the UK HUT CD album housed in a recess with individually numbered silver metal embossed plate at the side and a 20-page booklet housed in a similar recess in the lid. Though the CD itself and the booklet are official and genuine, the wooden box is not an official Virgin (US) or HUT (UK) release.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;Siamese Dream&quot; was released on July 27, 1993, and debuted at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the following week. The album was almost universally lauded by music critics. &quot;Select&quot;″s Andrew Perry praised it as &quot;the most grand-scale, expansively-passionate blasts of music you&#x27;ll hear this year&quot; and remarked that it would be &quot;hard for anyone to top this one&quot;. John Harris of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;for all its air of non-committal blankness and exercise-book psychoanalysis, is a startling, deeply satisfying record&quot;. Steve Hochman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; predicted that &quot;the scale of its success will likely be tied to how many fans are willing to stop moshing and enter into some rather contemplative, even tender territory&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the songs tend to drift in places, and some get a bit long-winded, but the overall balance between the harsh and the sweet makes for a strong and distinctive package&quot;. Lorraine Ali of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;a strong, multidimensional extension of &quot;Gish&quot; that confirms that Smashing Pumpkins are neither sellouts nor one-offs.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic David Browne praised the band for living up to industry expectations of being the &quot;next Nirvana&quot; and compared &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; favorably to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, concluding: &quot;In aiming for more than just another alternative guitar record, Smashing Pumpkins may have stumbled upon a whole new stance: slackers with a vision.&quot; Critic Simon Reynolds disagreed; he wrote in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;fuzzed-up riffs and angst-wracked vocals are quite the norm these days, and Smashing Pumpkins lacks the zeitgeist-defining edge that made Nirvana&#x27;s breakthrough so thrilling and resonant.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; as highlights while noting the record&#x27;s strength is &quot;the sonics&quot;; he later rated the album with a three-star honorable mention. &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; earned the Smashing Pumpkins their first Grammy Award nominations. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance, and the group was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Siamese Dream&quot; continues to receive critical praise and has been frequently included in lists of the best albums of the 1990s—the &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked it fourth, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it 18th, and &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it 23rd. In 2003, the album was ranked number 360 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, with the album&#x27;s ranking dropping to number 362 and rising to number 341 in the 2012 and 2020 updates of the list, respectively. In a retrospective review of the album, Greg Prato of AllMusic called &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; &quot;one of the finest alt-rock albums of all time&quot; and remarked that it &quot;stands alongside &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;Superunknown&quot; as one of the decade&#x27;s finest (and most influential) rock albums.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot wrote that it &quot;became a soundtrack for a significant portion of [Corgan&#x27;s] generation&quot; and &quot;did so by tempering some of the first album&#x27;s extremes; sticky melodies and pretty production can make almost anything radio-friendly, even a desperately sad song like &#x27;Today.&#x27;&quot; In a review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Ned Raggett remarked that while initial reviews of the album singled out Corgan&#x27;s lyrics for criticism, they were actually &quot;exactly what made the band click even further&quot;, commending Corgan&#x27;s &quot;ear for hooks, metaphors, and deft summaries.&quot; The deluxe edition of the album holds a score of 96 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In April 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Siamese Dream as the 12th greatest grunge album of all time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="215245" wikidata="Q1122846" url="?curid=215245" title="Districts of Japan">
<text>In Japan, a is composed of one or more rural municipalities (towns or villages) within a prefecture. Districts have no governing function, and are only used for geographic or statistical purposes such as mailing addresses. Cities are not part of districts.

Historically, districts have at times functioned as an administrative unit. From 1878 to 1921 district governments were roughly equivalent to a county of the United States, ranking below prefecture and above town or village, on the same level as a city. District governments were entirely abolished by 1926.

== History ==
The bureaucratic administration of Japan is divided into three basic levels: national, prefectural, and municipal. Below the national government there are 47 prefectures, six of which are further subdivided into subprefectures to better service large geographical areas or remote islands. The municipalities (cities, towns and villages) are the lowest level of government; the twenty most-populated cities outside Tokyo Metropolis are known as designated cities and are subdivided into wards. The district was initially called &quot;kōri&quot; and has ancient roots in Japan. Although the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; says they were established during the Taika Reforms, &quot;kōri&quot; was originally written . It was not until the Taihō Code that &quot;kōri&quot; came to be written as (imitating the Chinese division). Under the Taihō Code, the administrative unit of was above district, and the village ( or &quot;sato&quot;) was below.

As the power of the central government decayed (and in some periods revived) over the centuries, the provinces and districts, although never formally abolished and still connected to administrative positions handed out by the Imperial court (or whoever controlled it), largely lost their relevance as administrative units and were superseded by a hierarchy of feudal holdings. In the Edo period, the primary subdivisions were the shogunate cities, governed by urban administrators &quot;(machi-bugyō)&quot;, the shogunate domain (&quot;bakuryō&quot;, usually meant to include the smaller holdings of Hatamoto, etc.), major holdings (&quot;han&quot;/domains), and there was also a number of minor territories such as spiritual (shrine/temple) holdings; while the shogunate domain comprised vast, contiguous territories, domains consisted of generally only one castle and castle town, usually a compact territory in the surrounding area, but beyond that sometimes a string of disconnected exclaves and enclaves, in some cases distributed over several districts in several provinces. For this reason alone, they were impractical as geographical units, and in addition, Edo period feudalism was tied to the nominal income of a territory, not the territory itself, so the shogunate could and did redistribute territories between domains, their borders were generally subject to change, even if in some places holdings remained unchanged for centuries. Provinces and districts remained the most important geographical frame of reference throughout the middle and early modern ages up to the restoration and beyond – initially, the prefectures were created in direct succession to the shogunate era feudal divisions and their borders kept shifting through mergers, splits and territorial transfers until they reached largely their present state in the 1890s.Cities &quot;(-shi)&quot;, since their introduction in 1889, have always belonged directly to prefectures and are independent from districts. Before 1878, districts had subdivided the whole country with only few exceptions (Edo/Tokyo as shogunate capital and some island groups). In 1878, the districts were reactivated as administrative units, but the major cities were separated from the districts. All prefectures (at that time only &quot;-fu&quot; and &quot;-ken&quot;) were – except for some remote islands – contiguously subdivided into [rural] districts/counties (&quot;-gun&quot;) and urban districts/cites (&quot;-ku&quot;), the precursors to the 1889 &quot;shi&quot;. Geographically, the rural districts were mainly based on the ancient districts, but in many places they were merged, split up or renamed, in some areas, prefectural borders went through ancient districts and the districts were reorganized to match; urban districts were completely separated from the rural districts, most of them covered one city at large, but the largest and most important cities, the Edo period &quot;three capitals&quot; Edo/Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka comprised several urban districts. (This refers only to the city areas which were not organized as a single administrative unit before 1889, not the prefectures Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka which had initially been created in 1868 as successor to the shogunate city administrations, but were soon expanded to surrounding shogunate rural domain and feudal holdings and by 1878 also contained rural districts and in the case of Osaka, one other urban district/city from 1881.)

District administrations were set up in 1878, but district assemblies were only created in 1890 with the introduction of the district code &quot;(gunsei)&quot; as part of the Prussian-influenced local government reforms of 1888–90. From the 1890s, district governments were run by a collective executive council (&quot;gun-sanjikai&quot;, 郡参事会), headed by the appointed district chief (&quot;gunchō&quot;) and consisting of 3 additional members elected by the district assembly and one appointed by the prefectural governor – similar to cities (&quot;shi-sanjikai&quot;, headed by the mayor) and prefectures (&quot;fu-/ken-sanjikai&quot;, headed by the governor).

In 1921, Hara Takashi, the first non-oligarchic prime minister (although actually from a Morioka domain samurai family himself, but in a career as commoner-politician in the House of Representatives), managed to get his long-sought abolition of the districts passed – unlike the municipal and prefectural assemblies which had been an early platform for the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement before the Imperial Diet was established and became bases of party power, the district governments were considered to be a stronghold of anti-liberal Yamagata Aritomo&#x27;s followers and the centralist-bureaucratic Home Ministry tradition. The district assemblies and governments were abolished a few years later.

== Districts today ==
As of today, towns and villages also belong directly to prefectures; the districts no longer possess any administrations or assemblies since the 1920s, and therefore also no administrative authority – although there was a brief de facto reactivation of the districts during the Pacific War in the form of prefectural branch offices (called &quot;chihō jimusho&quot;, 地方事務所, &quot;local offices/bureaus&quot;) which generally had one district in their jurisdiction. However, for geographical and statistical purposes, districts continue to be used and are updated for municipal mergers or status changes: if a town or village (countrywide: &gt;15,000 in 1889, &lt;1,000 today) is merged into or promoted to a [by definition: district-independent] city (countrywide: 39 in 1889, 791 in 2017), the territory is no longer counted as part of the district. In this way, many districts have become extinct, and many of those that still exist contain only a handful of or often only one remaining municipality as many of today&#x27;s towns and villages are also much larger than in the Meiji era. The districts are used primarily in the Japanese addressing system and to identify the relevant geographical areas and collections of nearby towns and villages.

==Confusing cases in Hokkaidō==
Because district names had been unique within a single province and as of 2008 prefecture boundaries are roughly aligned to provincial boundaries, most district names are unique within their prefectures.

Hokkaidō Prefecture, however, came much later to the provincial system, only a few years before the prefectural system was introduced, so its eleven provinces included several districts with the same names:

*Three Kamikawa Districts and two Nakagawa Districts in the Hokkaidō Prefecture. Each jurisdiction refers to its geographical position along the river from which the former province, and subsequent subprefecture, takes its name. &quot;Kamikawa&quot; means upper course of the river; &quot;Nakagawa&quot; means middle course.
**Kamikawa Dist. (Ishikari), managed by the Kamikawa Subprefecture
**Kamikawa Dist. (Teshio), managed by the Kamikawa Subprefecture
**Kamikawa Dist. (Tokachi), managed by the Tokachi Subprefecture
**Nakagawa Dist. (Teshio), managed by the Kamikawa Subprefecture
**Nakagawa Dist. (Tokachi), managed by the Tokachi Subprefecture
*Abuta District, Rumoi District, Sorachi District, and Yufutsu District are similar, but each of them is a single district allotted to two subprefectures.
**Abuta District, managed by Iburi and Shiribeshi Subprefectures
**Sorachi District, managed by Kamikawa and Sorachi Subprefectures
**Teshio District, managed by Rumoi and Sōya Subprefectures
**Yūfutsu District, managed by Iburi and Kamikawa Subprefectures

<doc id="215246" wikidata="Q655602" url="?curid=215246" title="Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness">
<text>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the third studio album and first double album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on October 23, 1995, in the United Kingdom and on October 24 in the United States by Virgin Records. It was produced by the singer and guitarist Billy Corgan, alongside the producers Flood and Alan Moulder. The 28-track album was released as a two-disc CD and a triple LP. It features a wide array of musical styles, including art rock, grunge, alternative pop, and heavy metal.

Propelled by its lead single &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, the album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 246,500 units. It remains the band&#x27;s only album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned five more singles—&quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, the promotional &quot;Muzzle&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;—over the course of 1996, and was certified diamond by the RIAA, signifying over ten million units sold in the US. Recording sessions saw a wealth of productivity: dozens of fully completed songs were cut from the album and resurfaced on later releases. A box set released in November 1996 titled &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot; compiled its promotional singles and around 30 fully completed songs from the &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; sessions that had not made the final cut (including &quot;Pastichio Medley&quot;, a pastiche or medley of about 70 short pieces). Both albums were reissued years later with even more session tracks.

Lauded by critics for its ambition and scope, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; earned the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 1997, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year (&quot;1979&quot;), as well as nine MTV Music Video Awards nominations, eight of which were for &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, including Video of the Year. The singles became hits on mainstream rock and modern rock stations, and &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Three&quot; became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 hits, crossing over to pop radio stations. It has since been regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and of all time.

== Recording and production ==
After the 13-month tour in support of the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; second album &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; (1993), Billy Corgan immediately began writing songs for the band&#x27;s next record. From the outset, the band intended the new record to be a double album, partly inspired by the Beatles&#x27; self-titled album. Corgan said, &quot;We almost had enough material to make &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; a double album. With this new album, I really liked the notion that we would create a wider scope in which to put other kinds of material we were writing.&quot; Corgan felt that the band&#x27;s musical approach was running its course, and wanted the band to approach the album as if it were its last. Corgan described the album at the time to the music press as &quot;&quot;The Wall&quot; for Generation X&quot;, a comparison with Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 album, one of the highest-selling and best-known concept albums of all time.

The band decided against working with Butch Vig, who had produced the group&#x27;s previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as coproducers. Corgan explained, &quot;To be completely honest, I think it was a situation where we&#x27;d become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn&#x27;t want to repeat past Pumpkin work.&quot;

Flood immediately pushed the band to change its recording practices. Corgan later said, &quot;Flood felt like the band he would see live wasn&#x27;t really captured on record&quot;. In April 1995, the band began recording in a rehearsal space instead of entering the studio straight away. At these sessions, the band recorded rough rhythm tracks with Flood. Although originally designed to create a rough draft for the record, the rehearsal-space sessions yielded much of the new album&#x27;s rhythm-section parts. Flood also insisted that the band set aside time each day devoted to jamming or songwriting, practices in which the band had never before engaged during recording sessions. Corgan said, &quot;Working like that kept the whole process very interesting—kept it from becoming a grind.&quot;

Corgan sought to eliminate the tension, long hours, and emotional strain that permeated the &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; recording sessions, about which he said, &quot;[T]o me, the biggest offender was the insidious amounts of time that everyone spends waiting for guitar parts to be overdubbed. There were literally weeks where no one had anything to do but sit and wait.&quot; The band countered idleness by using two recording rooms at the same time. This tactic allowed Corgan to develop vocals and song arrangements in one room while recording occurred in the other. During these sessions, Flood and Corgan would work in one room as Moulder, guitarist James Iha and bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky worked in a second. Iha and Wretzky had much greater roles in the recording sessions of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; compared to previous albums. This was, in large part, to counter rumours from the &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; sessions that Corgan was recording all of the bass and guitar parts by himself. Iha commented about how the recording sessions for &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; improved from that of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, noting:
The big change is that Billy is not being the big &#x27;I do this—I do that&#x27;. It&#x27;s much better. The band arranged a lot of songs for this record, and the song writing process was organic. The circumstances of the last record and the way that we worked was really bad.
Following the rehearsal-space sessions, the band recorded overdubs at the Chicago Recording Company. Pro Tools was used for recording guitar overdubs as well as for post-production electronic looping and sampling. Wretzky also recorded numerous backup vocal parts, but all were cut except that which was recorded for &quot;Beautiful&quot;. When the recording sessions concluded, the band had 57 potential songs for inclusion on &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;. The album was originally planned to have 31 songs, but the count was reduced to 28.

== Music ==
The songs on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; are intended to work together conceptually, with the two halves of the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more &quot;loose&quot; and &quot;vague&quot; than were the band&#x27;s previous records. He also said it is based on &quot;the human condition of mortal sorrow&quot;. Corgan aimed the album&#x27;s message at people between 14 and 24 years of age, hoping &quot;to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately. ... I&#x27;m waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed.&quot;

Musically, the album has been described as featuring alternative rock, grunge, alternative metal, art rock and heavy metal. Its sprawling nature resulted in diverse music styles from song to song, contrasting what some critics felt was the &quot;one dimensional flavor&quot; of the previous two albums. A much wider variety of instrumentation is used, such as piano (&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;), synthesizers and drum loops (&quot;1979&quot;), a live orchestra (&quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;) and even salt shakers and scissors (&quot;Cupid de Locke&quot;).

All guitars on the album were tuned down a half-step in order to &quot;make the music a little lower,&quot; according to Corgan. On some songs, such as &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, the sixth string was tuned down an additional whole step to C (referred to by Corgan as &quot;the &#x27;grunge tuning&#x27;&quot;). There was a greater variety to the number of guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, &quot;[I]n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn&#x27;t really the train of thought this time, although we did that too.&quot; &quot;To Forgive&quot; consists of only one live guitar take, while &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby&quot; contains approximately 70 guitar tracks. The various sections of &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot; were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools. Corgan and Iha shared soloing duties; Iha estimated that the guitar solo duties were divided &quot;half and half&quot; on the record.

Corgan has said that &quot;For the solo in &#x27;Fuck You (An Ode to No One),&#x27; I played until my fingers saw blood, You can&#x27;t play a weak guitar solo in such a propulsive song. It&#x27;s got to be attack-style.&quot; He explains this method by saying &quot;... I put on the headphones and stand one foot away from the amp. I turn the amp up so loud that I literally have to play harder than the feedback, because if I stop playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes.&quot;

All but two songs on the album were written by Corgan. The closing track from the first disc, &quot;Take Me Down&quot;, was written and sung by Iha, while the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot;, features lead vocals by all four band members and, according to the BMI database, was written solely by Iha, despite being credited on the album liner notes as being written by both Iha and Corgan. Iha wrote additional songs during the making of the album that did not make the final cut. Corgan said in a 1995 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, &quot;[T]here are some B sides that James did that are really good. They just don&#x27;t fit in the context of the album. And part of me feels bad. But over the seven years we&#x27;ve been together, the least uptight part of the band has been the music.&quot;

==Packaging and artwork==

The artwork and visual design were conceived by Wisconsin-based illustrator and collage artist John Craig, who had spent most of his career taking editorial commissions for magazines. Craig worked from Corgan&#x27;s scribbled notes and crude sketches, most of which arrived via fax. Craig made other illustrations that appear throughout the album&#x27;s packaging—animals smoking pipes, celestial bodies with faces, wayward children walking eerie dreamscapes—all with a vaguely antique quality. The woman on the front cover on top of a star is actually a collage made from two paintings: the face was taken from a painting entitled &quot;The Souvenir (Fidelity)&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, while the rest of the body was taken from Raphael&#x27;s portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria.

==Release, reception and legacy==
&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; was released on October 24, 1995. The night before, the band played a release-party show at the Riviera Theater in Chicago and took part in a live FM broadcast across the United States. The following week, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, an unusual feat for a double-disc album that cost more than US$20. The album was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. 

===Critical reception===
The album received critical acclaim. Christopher John Farley of &quot;Time&quot; called the album &quot;the group&#x27;s most ambitious and accomplished work yet&quot;. Farley wrote, &quot;One gets the feeling that the band [...] charged ahead on gut instincts; the sheer scope of the album (28 songs) didn&#x27;t allow for second-guessing or contrivance.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; selected &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; as the best album of the year in its year-end &quot;Best of 1995&quot; list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group&#x27;s ambition and wrote, &quot;&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; is more than just the work of a tortured, finicky pop obsessive. Corgan presents himself as one of the last true believers: someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for the ages. He doesn&#x27;t seem concerned with persistent alterna-rock questions of &#x27;selling out&#x27;, and good for him: He&#x27;s aiming for something bigger and all-conquering.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; gave the album a score of 9.5 out of 10 and said, &quot;As the band&#x27;s magnum opus it single-handedly changed the face of Alternative Rock. That said, it&#x27;s not just music, but a work of art.&quot; &quot;The Music Box&quot; gave it all five stars and said, &quot;Indeed, for all its melodramatic self-indulgence, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; is one of the best double albums of new material to be released by anyone in a long time.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as &quot;one of the rare epic rock releases whose bulk is justified in the grooves&quot;. DeRogatis noted that &quot;the 28 songs on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; aren&#x27;t linked by a libretto. They&#x27;re only connected conceptually through the broad theme of being part of a day in the life of a typical, alienated teen.&quot; The writer stated that the album&#x27;s main flaw was Corgan&#x27;s lyrics, describing the songwriter as &quot;wallowing in his own misery and grousing about everyone and everything not meeting his expectations.&quot; DeRogatis contended that while &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; &quot;may even match &quot;The Wall&quot; in its sonic accomplishments&quot;, Corgan&#x27;s lyrics lacked in comparison. &quot;Mojo&quot; reviewer Ben Edmunds also praised the music while criticizing Corgan&#x27;s lyrics. Edmunds wrote, &quot;[Corgan&#x27;s] lyrics appear to be the repository for the worst aspects of his most treasured influences. He writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog-rock conviction of its worth, a deadening combination. But there&#x27;s a sliver of distance in his rage-mongering now that comments as well as expresses.&quot; In his Consumer Guide, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau picked &quot;1979&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;.

===Singles===
The album spawned five singles. While Corgan considered issuing &quot;Jellybelly&quot; as the album&#x27;s first single, he told &quot;Chart&quot; it was passed over in favor of &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; because &quot;&#x27;Bullet&#x27;s one of those songs where, you know, it&#x27;s easy to sing along to and [he affects a drawl] ya gotta sell them records.&quot; &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; was the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; first single to reach the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, debuting at number 28 and peaking at number 22. &quot;1979&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, charted at number 12, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting American hit. The &quot;Zero&quot; single was released as an EP with six B-sides. All three of these singles were certified gold by the RIAA. &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;, the album&#x27;s final singles, reached number 36 and number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, respectively. While it was not commercially released as a single, the song &quot;Muzzle&quot; reached number eight on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number ten on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

===Accolades===
&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; earned the Smashing Pumpkins nominations in seven categories at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the second-highest number of nominations that year. The group was nominated for Album of the Year, Record of the Year (&quot;1979&quot;), Best Alternative Music Performance, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (&quot;1979&quot;), Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal (&quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;), Best Pop Instrumental Performance (&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;), and Best Music Video, Short Form (&quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;). The band won a single award, for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal for &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;; it was the group&#x27;s first. In 2000 it was voted number 76 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; also ranked at number 14 on the 1995 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, and 487 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. On April 1, 2019 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it 26th greatest Grunge album of all time. In 2015, &quot;Spin&quot; included it in their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===Triple LP Vinyl Release===
A limited-edition triple LP was released in the United Kingdom on April 29, 1996. The first pressing featured 23,000 numbered copies made in England. This edition has two additional tracks (&quot;Tonite Reprise&quot; and &quot;Infinite Sadness&quot;) that are not included in CD and cassette releases. The triple LP was re-pressed with a blank white box where first-run copies were numbered.

=== 2012 reissue ===
As part of EMI Music&#x27;s extensive reissue campaign, a special edition of the album was released on December 4, 2012. The 5-CD disc set consists of 64 bonus tracks of previously unreleased material, demos and alternate versions of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; era songs—including full versions of tracks notably featured as parts of the &quot;Pastichio Medley&quot; from the &quot;Zero&quot; EP—as well as six new mixes of original album songs.

The package also includes a DVD consisting of footage from two live shows: Tracks 1–11 taken from the group&#x27;s concert of May 15, 1996, at the Brixton Academy in London, England, originally filmed by MTV Europe, and tracks 12–15 from their show of April 7, 1996, at the Philipshalle in Düsseldorf, Germany that was filmed by the German TV show &quot;Rockpalast&quot;. The bonus content and special features were curated from the band&#x27;s archives by Corgan and were remastered from the original master tapes by Bob Ludwig.

==Track listing==
&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; was intended as a two-record set. The CD and cassette versions of the album are divided into two discs, entitled &quot;Dawn to Dusk&quot; and &quot;Twilight to Starlight&quot;. The vinyl version is divided into three records with six sides, entitled &quot;Dawn/Tea Time&quot;, &quot;Dusk/Twilight&quot;, and &quot;Midnight/Starlight&quot;. The vinyl release also features two bonus songs (&quot;Tonite Reprise&quot; and &quot;Infinite Sadness&quot;), and a completely rearranged track order. In 2012 the album was remastered and rereleased as a six-disc edition, with three bonus CDs and a DVD. A four-LP release that year retained the CD track order instead of the original LP order.

<text>The nephron is the minute or microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney. It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and a cup-shaped structure called Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The renal tubule extends from the capsule. The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen. A healthy adult has 1 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney. Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers: the endothelial cells of the capillary wall, its basement membrane, and between the podocyte foot processes of the lining of the capsule. The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule. As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule, it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule: water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged (some are added, others are removed); first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules, and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary. This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances. At the end of the tubule, the remaining fluid—urine—exits: it is composed of water, metabolic waste, and toxins.

The interior of Bowman&#x27;s capsule, called Bowman&#x27;s space, collects the filtrate from the filtering capillaries of the glomerular tuft, which also contains mesangial cells supporting these capillaries. These components function as the filtration unit and make up the renal corpuscle. The filtering structure (glomerular filtration barrier) has three layers composed of endothelial cells, a basement membrane, and podocyte foot processes. The tubule has five anatomically and functionally different parts: the proximal tubule, which has a convoluted section called the proximal convoluted tubule followed by a straight section (proximal straight tubule); the loop of Henle, which has two parts, the descending loop of Henle (&quot;descending loop&quot;) and the ascending loop of Henle (&quot;ascending loop&quot;); the distal convoluted tubule (&quot;distal loop&quot;); the connecting tubule, and the last part of nephron the collecting ducts. Nephrons have two lengths with different urine-concentrating capacities: long juxtamedullary nephrons and short cortical nephrons.

The four mechanisms used to create and process the filtrate (the result of which is to convert blood to urine) are filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion. Filtration or ultrafiltration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive: it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure. About one-fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries; four-fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries. Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman&#x27;s capsule are blood proteins, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day: 99% of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed. Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive, due to diffusion, or active, due to pumping against a concentration gradient. Secretion also occurs in the tubules and collecting duct and is active. Substances reabsorbed include: water, sodium chloride, glucose, amino acids, lactate, magnesium, calcium phosphate, uric acid, and bicarbonate. Substances secreted include urea, creatinine, potassium, hydrogen, and uric acid. Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate, and thereby maintain homeostasis, include (along with the substance affected) antidiuretic hormone (water), aldosterone (sodium, potassium), parathyroid hormone (calcium, phosphate), atrial natriuretic peptide (sodium) and brain natriuretic peptide (sodium). A countercurrent system in the renal medulla provides the mechanism for generating a hypertonic interstitium, which allows the recovery of solute-free water from within the nephron and returning it to the venous vasculature when appropriate.

Some diseases of the nephron predominantly affect either the glomeruli or the tubules. Glomerular diseases include diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy; renal tubular diseases include acute tubular necrosis and polycystic kidney disease.

== Structure ==

The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. This means that each separate nephron is where the main work of the kidney is performed.

A nephron is made of two parts:
* a renal corpuscle, which is the initial filtering component, and
* a renal tubule that processes and carries away the filtered fluid.

=== Renal corpuscle ===

The renal corpuscle is the site of the filtration of blood plasma. The renal corpuscle consists of the glomerulus, and the glomerular capsule or Bowman&#x27;s capsule.

The renal corpuscle has two poles: a vascular pole and a tubular pole. The arterioles from the renal circulation enter and leave the glomerulus at the vascular pole. The glomerular filtrate leaves the Bowman&#x27;s capsule at the renal tubule at the urinary pole.

===Glomerulus===
The glomerulus is the network, known as a &quot;tuft&quot;, of filtering capillaries located at the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle in Bowman&#x27;s capsule. Each glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal circulation. The glomerular blood pressure provides the driving force for water and solutes to be filtered out of the blood plasma, and into the interior of Bowman&#x27;s capsule, called Bowman&#x27;s space.

Only about a fifth of the plasma is filtered in the glomerulus. The rest passes into an efferent arteriole. The diameter of the efferent arteriole is smaller than that of the afferent, and this difference increases the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.

===Bowman&#x27;s capsule===
The Bowman&#x27;s capsule, also called the glomerular capsule, surrounds the glomerulus. It is composed of a visceral inner layer formed by specialized cells called podocytes, and a parietal outer layer composed of simple squamous epithelium. Fluids from blood in the glomerulus are ultrafiltered through several layers, resulting in what is known as the filtrate.

The filtrate next moves to the renal tubule, where it is further processed to form urine. The different stages of this fluid are collectively known as the tubular fluid.

===Renal tubule=== 
The renal tubule is a continuous and long pipe-like structure containing the tubular fluid filtered through the glomerulus. The filtrate passing through the renal tubule ultimately ends at the collecting duct system.

The components of the renal tubule are:

# Proximal convoluted tubule: lies in the cortex and is lined by &#x27;simple cuboidal epithelium with brush borders&#x27; which greatly increase surface area for absorption.
# Loop of Henle: lies in the medulla and is U-shaped (similar to a hair-pin)
#* Descending limb of loop of Henle: one segment of equal thickness
#* Ascending limb of loop of Henle: two segments of differing thickness (proximal portion lined by simple squamous epithelium is called the thin ascending limb of loop of Henle, distal portion lined by simple cuboidal epithelium is called the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle).
# Distal convoluted tubule: lies in the cortex 
# Collecting tubule

The epithelial cells that form these nephron segments can be distinguished by the shapes of their actin cytoskeleton visualized by confocal microscopy of fluorescent phalloidin.

Blood from the efferent arteriole, containing everything that was not filtered out in the glomerulus, moves into the peritubular capillaries, tiny blood vessels that surround the loop of Henle and the proximal and distal tubules, where the tubular fluid flows. Substances then reabsorb from the latter back to the blood stream.

The peritubular capillaries then recombine to form an efferent venule, which combines with efferent venules from other nephrons into the renal vein, and rejoins the main bloodstream.

=== Length difference ===
Cortical nephrons (the majority of nephrons) start high in the cortex and have a short loop of Henle which does not penetrate deeply into the medulla. Cortical nephrons can be subdivided into &quot;superficial cortical nephrons&quot; and &quot;midcortical nephrons&quot;.
Juxtamedullary nephrons start low in the cortex near the medulla and have a long loop of Henle which penetrates deeply into the renal medulla: only they have their loop of Henle surrounded by the vasa recta. These long loops of Henle and their associated vasa recta create a hyperosmolar gradient that allows for the generation of concentrated urine. Also the hairpin bend penetrates up to the inner zone of medulla.

Juxtamedullary nephrons are found only in birds and mammals, and have a specific location: &quot;medullary&quot; refers to the renal medulla, while &quot;juxta&quot; (Latin: near) refers to the relative position of the renal corpuscle of this nephron - &quot;near the medulla&quot;, but still in the cortex. In other words, a &quot;juxtamedullary nephron&quot; is a nephron whose renal corpuscle is near the medulla, and whose proximal convoluted tubule and its associated loop of Henle occur deeper in the medulla than the other type of nephron, the cortical nephron.

The juxtamedullary nephrons comprise only about 15% of the nephrons in the human kidney. However, it is this type of nephron which is most often depicted in illustrations of nephrons.

In humans, cortical nephrons have their renal corpuscles in the outer two thirds of the cortex, whereas juxtamedullary nephrons have their corpuscles in the inner third of the cortex.

== Functions ==

The nephron uses four mechanisms to convert blood into urine: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. These apply to numerous substances. The structure and function of the epithelial cells lining the lumen change during the course of the nephron, and have segments named by their location and which reflects their different functions.


===Proximal tubule===
The proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into an initial convoluted portion and a following straight (descending) portion. Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries, including 80% of glucose, more than half of the filtered salt, water and all filtered organic solutes (primarily glucose and amino acids).

===Loop of Henle===
The loop of Henle is a U-shaped tube that extends from the proximal tubule. It consists of a descending limb and an ascending limb. It begins in the cortex, receiving filtrate from the proximal convoluted tubule, extends into the medulla as the descending limb, and then returns to the cortex as the ascending limb to empty into the distal convoluted tubule. The primary role of the loop of Henle is to enable an organism to produce concentrated urine, not by increasing the tubular concentration, but by rendering the interstitial fluid hypertonic.

Considerable differences aid in distinguishing the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle. The descending limb is permeable to water and noticeably less permeable to salt, and thus only indirectly contributes to the concentration of the interstitium. As the filtrate descends deeper into the hypertonic interstitium of the renal medulla, water flows freely out of the descending limb by osmosis until the tonicity of the filtrate and interstitium equilibrate. The hypertonicity of the medulla (and therefore concentration of urine) is determined in part by the size of the loops of Henle.

Unlike the descending limb, the thick ascending limb is impermeable to water, a critical feature of the countercurrent exchange mechanism employed by the loop. The ascending limb actively pumps sodium out of the filtrate, generating the hypertonic interstitium that drives countercurrent exchange. In passing through the ascending limb, the filtrate grows hypotonic since it has lost much of its sodium content. This hypotonic filtrate is passed to the distal convoluted tubule in the renal cortex.

===Distal convoluted tubule===
The distal convoluted tubule has a different structure and function to that of the proximal convoluted tubule. Cells lining the tubule have numerous mitochondria to produce enough energy (ATP) for active transport to take place. Much of the ion transport taking place in the distal convoluted tubule is regulated by the endocrine system. In the presence of parathyroid hormone, the distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs more calcium and secretes more phosphate. When aldosterone is present, more sodium is reabsorbed and more potassium secreted. Ammonia is also absorbed during the selective reabsorption. Atrial natriuretic peptide causes the distal convoluted tubule to secrete more sodium.

=== Connecting tubule ===
A part of Distal nephron. This is the final segment of the tubule before it enters the collecting duct system. Water, some salts and nitrogenous waste like urea and creatinine are passed out to collecting tubule.

=== Collecting duct system ===

Each distal convoluted tubule delivers its filtrate to a system of collecting ducts, the first segment of which is the connecting tubule. The collecting duct system begins in the renal cortex and extends deep into the medulla. As the urine travels down the collecting duct system, it passes by the medullary interstitium which has a high sodium concentration as a result of the loop of Henle&#x27;s countercurrent multiplier system.

Because it has a different origin during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs than the rest of the nephron, the collecting duct is sometimes not considered a part of the nephron. Instead of originating from the metanephrogenic blastema, the collecting duct originates from the ureteric bud.

Though the collecting duct is normally impermeable to water, it becomes permeable in the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH affects the function of aquaporins, resulting in the reabsorption of water molecules as it passes through the collecting duct. Aquaporins are membrane proteins that selectively conduct water molecules while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. As much as three-quarters of the water from urine can be reabsorbed as it leaves the collecting duct by osmosis. Thus the levels of ADH determine whether urine will be concentrated or diluted. An increase in ADH is an indication of dehydration, while water sufficiency results in a decrease in ADH allowing for diluted urine.

Lower portions of the collecting organ are also permeable to urea, allowing some of it to enter the medulla, thus maintaining its high concentration (which is very important for the nephron).

Urine leaves the medullary collecting ducts through the renal papillae, emptying into the renal calyces, the renal pelvis, and finally into the urinary bladder via the ureter.

=== Juxtaglomerular apparatus ===

The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) is a specialized region associated with the nephron, but separate from it. It produces and secretes into the circulation the enzyme renin (angiotensinogenase), which cleaves angiotensinogen and results in the ten amino acid substance angiotensin-1 (A-1). A-1 is then converted to angiotensin-2, a potent vasoconstrictor, by removing two amino acids: this is accomplished by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This sequence of events is referred to as the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The JGA is located between the thick ascending limb and the afferent arteriole. It contains three components: the macula densa, juxtaglomerular cells, and extraglomerular mesangial cells.

==Clinical significance==
Patients in early stages of chronic kidney disease show an approximate 50% reduction in the number of nephrons, comparable to the nephron loss that occurs with aging (between ages 18–29 and 70–75).

Diseases of the nephron predominantly affect either the glomeruli or the tubules. Glomerular diseases include diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy; renal tubular diseases include acute tubular necrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and polycystic kidney disease.

<doc id="215250" wikidata="Q210257" url="?curid=215250" title="MacGyver (1985 TV series)">
<text>MacGyver is an American action-adventure television series created by Lee David Zlotoff and starring Richard Dean Anderson as the title character. Henry Winkler and John Rich were the executive producers. The series follows the adventures of Angus MacGyver, a secret agent armed with remarkable scientific resourcefulness to solve any problem out in the field using any materials at hand.

The show ran for seven seasons on ABC in the United States and various other networks abroad from 1985 to 1992. The series was filmed in Los Angeles during seasons one, two and seven, and in Vancouver during seasons three through six. The show&#x27;s final episode aired on April 25, 1992, on ABC (the network aired a previously unseen episode for the first time on May 21, 1992, but it was originally intended to air before the series finale).

The series was a ratings success and gained a loyal following. It was popular in the United States and around the world. Two television films, &quot;Lost Treasure of Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Trail to Doomsday&quot;, aired on ABC in 1994. A spin-off series, &quot;Young MacGyver,&quot; was planned in 2003, but only the pilot was made. Merchandise for &quot;MacGyver&quot; includes games, toys, print media and an original audio series. A reboot series was broadcast on CBS from 2016 to 2021, which today owns the rights to the original series through its acquisition of the original Paramount Television.

==Plot==
The show follows secret agent Angus MacGyver, played by Richard Dean Anderson, who works as a troubleshooter for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States government agency, the &quot;Department of External Services&quot; (DXS). Educated as a scientist in Physics at Western Tech (&quot;Hell Week&quot;), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a Bomb Team Technician/EOD during the Vietnam War (&quot;Countdown&quot;). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the physical sciences, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife, duct tape, and occasionally matches. He favors non-violent resolutions and prefers not to handle firearms due to the accidental shooting death of one of his friends when he was 12.

His main asset is his practical application of scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problemsoften in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices in a matter of minuteswere a major attraction of the show, which helped generate interest in the applied sciences, including engineering, and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver&#x27;s exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show&#x27;s writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles. In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.

The show often dealt with social issues, though more so in seasons 4–7 than 1–3, which were mostly about MacGyver&#x27;s adventures working for the United States government and later for the Phoenix Foundation.

==Episodes==

Several episodes, including the pilot, begin with a cold open, finding MacGyver already on a mission. MacGyver often narrates a story from his childhood relating to his current situation. He resolves this situation quickly, and the main story commences after the opening credits. The credits refer to such an opening sequence as the &quot;Opening Gambit&quot;it occurs far more commonly in earlier episodes than in later ones. This segment is often written and directed by a different team than the main story of the episode. After the credits, the main story plays out in standard three-act structure. In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission but rather in a situation used for character development. In the same manner as the &quot;Opening Gambit&quot; sequences, these opening segments often do not directly relate to the main story.

==Cast==

* Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver, a secret agent who prefers not to carry or use a firearm, due to a childhood accident with a revolver that resulted in the death of a friend. However, MacGyver is willing to use an acquired gun, its parts, or its bullets in non-standard ways, such as a substitute for a wrench. There are three exceptions when he uses a gun for its original intended purpose: in the pilot episode, MacGyver is seen firing an AK-47 on a mission in the opening gambit (7:51 into the episode); he holds two kidnappers at gunpoint in the opening scene of episode 10, season one; and, is seen using a gun in the TV movie &quot;Trail to Doomsday&quot;. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees the Los Angeles-based Phoenix Foundation, his employer, as an alternative to more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.
* Dana Elcar as Pete Thornton, MacGyver&#x27;s boss and best friend. He was an operative at the &quot;Department of External Services&quot; (DXS), which is where he is impressed by Mac&#x27;s ingenuity while tracking down Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), an international assassin and master of disguise. When Thornton becomes director of operations at the &quot;Phoenix Foundation&quot; several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various tasks for the foundation, Thornton is many times forced to bail MacGyver out of the trouble he gets into, while at the same time being clueless and lacking street-smarts while In the field. Thornton has a son named Michael. Late in the show, it is learned that Pete has glaucoma, an element written in because of Elcar developing glaucoma in real life. Dana Elcar is first cast in the pilot episode as Andy Colson, the Chief of Operations at the KIVA Laboratories.
* Bruce McGill as Jack Dalton, MacGyver&#x27;s comical best friend. He is a soldier of fortune/bush pilot who periodically gets everyone into a heap of trouble with various get rich quick schemes out of which only MacGyver can rescue them. His left eye twitches when he is lying. Dalton often attempts to romance the women he is introduced to.

==Production==
===Development===
While creating the series &quot;MacGyver&quot;, John Rich was working on the sitcom &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot; for ABC, which was short-lived and cancelled quickly. Henry Winkler had just finished off his eleven-year run on &quot;Happy Days&quot; and was looking for another project. Lee David Zlotoff was working as a producer for &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, which was airing on NBC. The three got together to form the basis for &quot;MacGyver&quot; and sold the idea to Paramount, and ABC became interested in the series. Vin DiBona, the producer of America&#x27;s Funniest Videos, was also in the mix during early production of the show.
===Filming===
The series was filmed in Southern California for its first two seasons and again in its final season. From seasons 3 to 6, it was filmed in various locations around Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. Los Angeles remained as the setting of the show for the entire duration. The move to Vancouver was due to the threat of the series being cancelled due to the high production cost. In seasons 1 and 2, MacGyver was portrayed living in a waterfront apartment in Venice Beach. In season 3, he moved onto a houseboat at an unspecified location, though implied still to be in Los Angeles (the actual shooting took place at Coal Harbour, near downtown Vancouver). Filming returned to Los Angeles for the final season.

===Casting===
When the series was in pre-production, Winkler and Rich were looking for a suitable actor for the lead. After Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s appearance in the American television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Winkler got Anderson to audition for the part. According to Rich, every auditioning actor &quot;hulked&quot; his way through his audition. When Anderson eventually auditioned for the role, Winkler and Rich felt that he gave the character a human touch which the other actors could not. Both believed that Anderson would become one of the new &quot;breakout&quot; stars on American television.

Anderson is known for having done many of the stunts in the series, though in later seasons he reduced his participation because of accumulating injuries. He injured his back and required foot surgery because of accidents working as a stuntman.

==Broadcast history==
After a slow start in its first season, &quot;MacGyver&quot; became a sleeper hit for ABC in its second season, during which it began a six-year run as the lead-in to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (the longest such run in history). During the show&#x27;s fourth season, Richard Dean Anderson complained that ABC was not marketing the series enough. Saying that the series is &quot;just another action show&quot; for ABC, he further stated that ABC didn&#x27;t give the series enough promotion.

&quot;MacGyver&#x27;s&quot; seventh season was abbreviated. After the twelfth episode of the season aired on December 30, 1991, &quot;MacGyver&quot; disappeared from the ABC schedule and did not return until April 25, 1992, by which point the series had been canceled. The finale aired that night, with a previously unaired episode following on May 21, 1992. When asked why the series was canceled, Anderson replied: &quot;The only reason it went off the air was that everybody was ready to move on. I was physically exhausted and had no life.&quot;

===Ratings===
===TV films===
In 1994, the series was released in over 70 different worldwide markets. Because of popular demand, two TV-movies were created, both released in 1994. The first movie &quot;&quot; premiered in the United States in May. The film was shot in England and Greece. The second movie was entitled &quot;&quot;, and shot in England. Anderson served as executive producer for both films, which were filmed in Europe.

==Syndication and home media==
Reruns of the series still air in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Costa Rica and Ethiopia. Alongside local syndication, reruns aired on the USA Network from 1990 to 1997, on WGN America from 1998 to 2002, on TV Land from January 2003 to 2006, on Spike for a brief time in 2005. It is formerly aired on Cloo (2011–2017) with marathon blocks shown on the weekends and on May 13, 2015, Esquire Network started airing reruns of the series. MeTV Network had acquired the rights to air the series as of December 2, 2015. It aired weekday afternoons &amp; weeknights on MeTV from 12/19/16-5/26/17.

On June 15, 2010, Paramount released the two TV movies on DVD in Region1 in a separate single-disc release entitled &quot;MacGyver – The TV Movies.&quot;

On January 13, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment announced they would release a repackaged version of the complete series set on DVD in Region1, at a lower price, on April 7.

===High definition remaster===
In June 2018, CBS announced that the original camera negatives, thought to be lost, had been located and a high definition remaster of the series was underway. The June 21 press release confirmed that the first three seasons had been completed, with the remaining four to be remastered before the end of 2018. The press release also included a teaser showcasing the notable improvement in quality.

==Impact==
The series is referenced in episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, primarily detailing the obsession Marge Simpson&#x27;s sisters (Patty and Selma) have with the show and their crush on the MacGyver character. The sisters&#x27; regular viewing of the show is an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode &quot;Black Widower&quot;. The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. (&quot;Don&#x27;t thank me. Thank the moon&#x27;s gravitational pull.&quot;)

In the first episode of Anderson&#x27;s later show, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Amanda Tapping ad-libbed that the Air Force had to &quot;MacGyver&quot; a Dial Home Device for the Stargate, and a split-second shot following this shows Anderson &quot;flashing an understated wry smile&quot; in response; the producers, including Anderson, &quot;loved it&quot; and Anderson later stated &quot;I thought it was brilliant&quot;. (However, this line was removed when this episode was re-released in 2009.)

In 2006, Anderson appeared in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.

In an August 2007 survey commissioned by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, Americans polled voted MacGyver as the favorite fictional hero they would want to have if they were ever caught in an emergency.

In 2008, the phrase &quot;What would MacGyver do?&quot; was used in a New Zealand television commercial for Gregg&#x27;s &quot;freestyle cooking&quot; range of herbs and spices. The commercial featured the word MacGyver unfolding like a puzzle with a potato peeler and chopping knife opening out like the blades of a Swiss Army knife.

===&quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;MacGyverism&quot;===
MacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his science, technology, and outdoorsmanship technology, and sportsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to solve these problems, relying on only a Swiss Army knife and duct tape, instead of high-tech weapons and equipment like typical secret-agent show characters. These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called &quot;MacGyverisms&quot; by fans. The writers of the show based the inventions on ideas from scientific advisers, real events, items found on-location, and ideas submitted by fans in a contest with prize money. &quot;MacGyverism&quot; was first said on the show by the character Joanne Remmings in &quot;Twice Stung&quot; (season 2, episode 3).

&quot;MacGyverism&quot; led to the verb &quot;to MacGyver&quot;. In 1989, Richard Dean Anderson discussed this term on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;; Hall had heard it used to mean &#x27;to do the impossible&#x27;, and suggested it belonged in a dictionary. &quot;MacGyver&quot; entered the &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot; website in 2015 as a verb meaning &quot;make or repair (an object) in an improvised or inventive way, making use of whatever items are at hand&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===

==Failed reboot==
Jared Padalecki was part of a failed pilot for a &quot;MacGyver&quot; show.

==2016 CBS reboot series==

In October 2015, the original series&#x27; executive producer, Henry Winkler, signed on to produce a reboot series with James Wan and R. Scott Gemmill for CBS. The following May, the network picked up the series, with co-creator/exec producer Peter Lenkov to serve as showrunner, and indicated that the new series would air later that year. That June, however, the network scrapped the pilot episode and ordered a new pilot be directed by Wan with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. Justin Hires was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver&#x27;s roommate. In June, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Sandrine Holt was cast as Patricia Thornton, an ex-field agent who is now director of operations for the Department of External Services, and that Tristin Mays was cast as Riley Davis, a highly unpredictable computer hacker with a chip on her shoulder.

The rebooted show ran until 2021, when it was cancelled.

==In other media==
===Mobile game===
A 3D puzzle game based on the TV series titled &quot;MacGyver: Deadly Descent&quot; was released on iOS and Android.

===&quot;MacGyver and the New Citan&quot;===
Anderson reprised his role as MacGyver in September 2012 in a new series of short films, created by Mercedes-Benz for the launch of their new MPV Citan in Europe.

===Comic book===
The comic book was very well received around the world with the first issue selling out within the first two weeks and received mostly favorable reviews through major comic book sites. However, the series&#x27; lead author, Tony Lee, confirmed in September 2014 that the series in total did not sell well enough to warrant a second series.

===Audiobook===
Macgyver: Meltdown is an audiobook on Audible. Published 8-8-2022 the audio is 12 hours and 36 minutes, and involves Macgyver trying to find a billionaire thief who has skills similar to Macgyver&#x27;s own.

<doc id="215251" wikidata="Q1184244" url="?curid=215251" title="Delict">
<text>Delict (from Latin &quot;dēlictum&quot;, past participle of &quot;dēlinquere&quot; ‘to be at fault, offend’) is a term in civil and mixed law jurisdictions whose exact meaning varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but is always centered on the notion of wrongful conduct.

In Scots and Roman Dutch law, it always refers to a tort, which can be defined as a civil wrong consisting of an intentional or negligent breach of duty of care that inflicts loss or harm and which triggers legal liability for the wrongdoer. Other civil wrongs include breach of contract and breach of trust. Liability is imposed on the basis of moral responsibility, i.e. a duty of care or to act, and fault (&quot;culpa&quot;) is the main element of liability. The term is similarly used in a handful of other English speaking jurisdictions which derive their private law from French or Spanish law, such as Louisiana and the Philippines, but &quot;tort&quot; is the equivalent legal term used in common law jurisdictions and in general discussions of non-contractual liability.

In Spanish law, &quot;delito &quot; is any breach of criminal law, i.e. a criminal offence. In Italian law, &quot;delitto penale&quot; is the same concept, but &quot;illecito civile extracontrattuale&quot; (or &quot;delitto civile&quot;), like delict in Scots law, is an intentional or negligent act which gives rise to a legal obligation between parties even though there has been no contract between them, akin to common-law tort. German-speaking countries use the word &quot;Delikt&quot; for crime and &quot;unerlaubte Handlung&quot; for delict, but &quot;Deliktsrecht&quot; is a branch of civil law (similar to tort law). In French law, &quot;délit penal&quot; is a misdemeanor (between &quot;contravention&quot; ‘petty offence’ and &quot;crime&quot; ‘felony; major indictable offence’), while &quot;délit civil&quot;, again, is a tort. Because of this, French law prefers to speak in terms of &quot;responsabilité civile&quot; (‘civil liability’). In the canon law of the Catholic Church, a delict is a crime.

== Scots law: delict as a willful wrong ==

In the most narrowly construed sense, delict is a Latin word (&quot;delictum&quot; ‘offence, wrong’) and a legal term, which, in some civil law systems, signifies a willful wrong, similar to the common law concept of tort though differing in many substantive ways. The law of delict in civil law countries is usually a general statute passed by the legislature whereas tort law in common law countries arises from case law. In addition, a delict is defined abstractly in terms of infringement of rights whereas in common law, there are many specific types of torts (English terminology).

Delict deals with the righting of legal wrongs in civil law. In modern times much of the literature on delict, and most case law heard before the courts, deals with issues arising from negligence. Insofar as liability for negligent wrongdoing is concerned, the principle of liability is based on reparation for &quot;damnum injuria&quot;, or loss caused by wrongful conduct. When considering pursuing such a claim, one must prove, in addition to the existence of some recognised form of loss, that three additional criteria have been met: &quot;firstly&quot; one must demonstrate that the pursuer was owed a duty of care, &quot;secondly&quot; one must prove that the defender breached this duty of care and &quot;lastly&quot; one must show a causal link between the defender&#x27;s breach of the duty of care and the loss complained of by the pursuer.

In addition to comprising rules pertaining to reparation for loss caused by negligent conduct, discussed above, the Scots law of delict is also concerned with affording remedy in cases which concern non-patrimonial injury, wilful interference with property rights and the commission of nominate delicts (such as, e.g., defamation). The rules for establishing liability in such cases differ from the &#x27;duty of care&#x27; analysis discussed above, although the principles of reparation for property damage remain based on the general principle that reparation should be afforded where there has been loss caused by wrongful conduct. The requirements to establish liability for nominate delicts will depend on bespoke rules, while reparation for non-patrimonial injury (e.g., affront caused by intentional wrongdoing) is afforded in line with the principles of the Roman &quot;actio injuriarum&quot;. 

==German-speaking countries==
By contrast, the civil law of German-speaking countries does not differentiate between delict (&quot;Delikt&quot;) and quasi-delict (&quot;Quasidelikt&quot;) as do French and Roman law. Under German &quot;Deliktsrecht&quot;, or ‘law of delict’, claims for damages can arise from either fault-based liability (&quot;Verschuldenshaftung&quot;), i.e. with intention (&quot;Vorsatz&quot;) or through negligence (&quot;Fahrlässigkeit&quot;), or strict liability (&quot;Gefährdungshaftung&quot;). Under § 823 BGB, damages can be based on harm inflicted either on an &quot;erga omnes&quot; right (&quot;absolute Rechtgut&quot;) such as life, bodily autonomy, health, freedom and ownership, or on the violation of a law protecting a certain legal interest.

However, § 826 BGB (and the similar Austrian § 1295(2) ABGB) compare closely to delict. Under this provision, someone who intentionally inflicts harm on another person &quot;contra bonos mores&quot; (&quot;gegen die gute Sitten&quot;) is liable for damages. This widens the scope of delictual liability not just to the infringement of rights (as in French law) but also to pure economic loss (&quot;echter/reiner Vermögensschaden&quot;).

==South Africa and Sri Lanka==

South African law and Sri Lanka also use the law of delict as opposed to torts. The South African common law elaborates a set of general principles in terms of which liability for loss is allocated. This should be seen in contrast to the Anglo-American common law approach which has distinct tort actions, each with their own peculiar elements which require satisfaction before an action is founded. The delictual elements that have to be satisfied before a claimant can be successful are:

#Conduct – which may consist of either a commission (positive action) or an omission (the failure to take required action), though liability for an omission will arise only where there is a duty to act.
#Unlawfulness – the conduct complained of must be legally reprehensible. This is usually assessed with reference to the legal convictions of the community.
#Fault – save in limited cases where liability is &#x27;strict&#x27; (i.e. where neither intention nor negligence is required for liability) once the wrongfulness of the conduct is established, it is necessary to establish whether the person being sued acted intentionally or negligently, either of which is sufficient for liability to attach.
#Damage – finally the conduct must have resulted in some form of loss or harm to the claimant in order for them to have a claim. This damage can take the form of patrimonial loss (a reduction in a person&#x27;s financial position, such as is the case where the claimant incurred medical expenses) or non-patrimonial damages (damages that cannot be related to a person&#x27;s financial estate, but compensation for something like pain and suffering).
#Causation – the conduct that the claimant complains of must have caused damage, in this regard both factual causation and legal causation are assessed. The purpose of legal causation is to limit the scope of factual causation, if the consequence of the action is too remote to have been foreseen by an objective, reasonable person the defendant will escape liability.

It is possible that a single set of facts may give rise to both a contractual and a delictual claim. The definition of &quot;animus contrahendi&quot; states an intention to contract.

Public policy considerations are evident in the setting of the limits to each of the requirements.

In the Canon law of the Catholic Church, a delict is the canonical equivalent of a crime. A delict is distinct from a sin, even a mortal sin. One can be legally guilty of a delict and not be morally culpable for a sin, while one can be culpable for a sin and not legally guilty of a delict.

<doc id="215255" wikidata="Q318773" url="?curid=215255" title="Abducens nerve">
<text>The abducens nerve or abducent nerve, also known as the sixth cranial nerve, cranial nerve VI, or simply CN VI, is a cranial nerve in humans and various other animals that controls the movement of the lateral rectus muscle, one of the extraocular muscles responsible for outward gaze. It is a somatic efferent nerve.

==Structure==
===Nucleus===

The abducens nucleus is located in the pons, on the floor of the fourth ventricle, at the level of the facial colliculus. Axons from the facial nerve loop around the abducens nucleus, creating a slight bulge (the facial colliculus) that is visible on the dorsal surface of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The abducens nucleus is close to the midline, like the other motor nuclei that control eye movements (the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei).

Motor axons leaving the abducens nucleus run ventrally and caudally through the pons. They pass lateral to the corticospinal tract (which runs longitudinally through the pons at this level) before exiting the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction.

=== Course ===
The abducens nerve emerges from the brainstem at the junction of the pons and the medulla, superior to the medullary pyramid, and medial to the facial nerve. It runs upwards and forwards from this position to reach the eye.

The nerve enters the subarachnoid space (more precisely, the pontine cistern) when it emerges from the brainstem. It runs upward between the pons and the clivus, and then pierces the dura mater to run between the dura and the skull through Dorello&#x27;s canal. At the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone, it makes a sharp turn forward to enter the cavernous sinus. In the cavernous sinus, it runs anterior-ward alongside (inferolateral to) the internal carotid artery. It enters the orbit through (medial end of) the superior orbital fissure, passing through the common tendinous ring to reach and innervate the lateral rectus muscle of the eye.

===Development===
The human abducens nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic pons.

==Function==
The abducens nerve supplies the lateral rectus muscle of the human eye. This muscle is responsible for outward gaze. The abducens nerve carries axons of type GSE, general somatic efferent.

==Clinical significance==

===Damage===
Damage to the peripheral part of the abducens nerve will cause double vision (diplopia), due to the unopposed muscle tone of the medial rectus muscle. The affected eye is pulled to look towards the midline. In order to see without double vision, patients will rotate their heads so that both eyes are toward the temple. Partial damage to the abducens nerve causes weak or incomplete abduction of the affected eye. The diplopia is worse on attempts at looking laterally.

The long course of the abducens nerve between the brainstem and the eye makes it vulnerable to injury at many levels. For example, fractures of the petrous temporal bone can selectively damage the nerve, as can aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery. Mass lesions that push the brainstem downward can damage the nerve by stretching it between the point where it emerges from the pons and the point where it hooks over the petrous temporal bone.

The central anatomy of the sixth nerve predicts (correctly) that infarcts affecting the dorsal pons at the level of the abducens nucleus can also affect the facial nerve, producing an ipsilateral facial palsy together with a lateral rectus palsy. The anatomy also predicts (correctly) that infarcts involving the ventral pons can affect the sixth nerve and the corticospinal tract simultaneously, producing a lateral rectus palsy associated with a contralateral hemiparesis. These rare syndromes are of interest primarily as useful summaries of the anatomy of the brainstem.

===Peripheral lesions===
Complete interruption of the peripheral sixth nerve causes diplopia (double vision), due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle. The affected eye is pulled medially. In order to see without double vision, patients will turn their heads sideways so that both eyes are looking sideways. On formal testing, the affected eye cannot abduct past the midline – it cannot look sideways, toward the temple. Partial damage to the sixth nerve causes weak or incomplete abduction of the affected eye. The diplopia is worse on attempted lateral gaze, as would be expected (since the lateral gaze muscle is impaired).

Peripheral sixth nerve damage can be caused by tumors, aneurysms, or fractures – anything that directly compresses or stretches the nerve. Other processes that can damage the sixth nerve include strokes (infarctions), demyelination, infections (e.g. meningitis), cavernous sinus diseases and various neuropathies. Perhaps the most common overall cause of sixth nerve impairment is diabetic neuropathy. Iatrogenic injury is also known to occur, with the abducens nerve being the most commonly injured cranial nerve in halo orthosis placement. The resultant palsy is identified through loss of lateral gaze after application of the orthosis.

Rare causes of isolated sixth nerve damage include Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome and Tolosa–Hunt syndrome. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome is caused by thiamine deficiency, classically due to alcoholism. The characteristic ocular abnormalities are nystagmus and lateral rectus weakness. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that causes painful oculomotor (especially sixth nerve) palsies.

Indirect damage to the sixth nerve can be caused by any process (brain tumor, hydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri, hemorrhage, edema) that exerts downward pressure on the brainstem, causing the nerve to stretch along the clivus. This type of traction injury can affect either side first. A right-sided brain tumor can produce either a right-sided or a left-sided sixth nerve palsy as an initial sign. Thus a right-sided sixth nerve palsy does not necessarily imply a right-sided cause. Sixth nerve palsies are infamous as &quot;false localizing signs.&quot; Neurological signs are described as &quot;false localizing&quot; if they reflect dysfunction distant or remote from the expected anatomical location of pathology. Isolated sixth nerve palsies in children are assumed to be due to brain tumors until proven otherwise.

===Nuclear lesions===

Damage to the abducens nucleus does not produce an isolated sixth nerve palsy, but rather a horizontal gaze palsy that affects both eyes simultaneously. The abducens nucleus contains two types of cells: motor neurons that control the lateral rectus muscle on the same side, and interneurons that cross the midline and connect to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (which controls the medial rectus muscle of the opposite eye). In normal vision, lateral movement of one eye (lateral rectus muscle) is precisely coupled to medial movement of the other eye (medial rectus muscle), so that both eyes remain fixed on the same object.

The control of conjugate gaze is mediated in the brainstem by the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), a nerve tract that connects the three extraocular motor nuclei (abducens, trochlear and oculomotor) into a single functional unit. Lesions of the abducens nucleus and the MLF produce observable sixth nerve problems, most notably internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).

===Supranuclear lesions===

The sixth nerve is one of the final common pathways for numerous cortical systems that control eye movement in general. Cortical control of eye movement (saccades, smooth pursuit, accommodation) involves conjugate gaze, not unilateral eye movement.

===Tuberculosis===
15–40% of people with tuberculosis have some resulting cranial nerve deficit. The sixth nerve is the most commonly affected cranial nerve in immunocompetent people with tuberculosis.

==History==

===Etymology===
The Latin name for the sixth cranial nerve is &quot;nervus abducens&quot;. The Terminologia Anatomica officially recognizes two different English translations: &quot;abducent nerve&quot; and &quot;abducens nerve&quot;.

&quot;Abducens&quot; is more common in recent literature, while &quot;abducent&quot; predominates in the older literature. The United States National Library of Medicine uses &quot;abducens nerve&quot; in its Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) vocabulary to index the vast MEDLINE and PubMed biomedical databases. The 39th edition of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2005) also prefers &quot;abducens nerve.&quot;

==Other animals==
The abducens nerve controls the movement of a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye. In most other mammals it also innervates the musculus retractor bulbi, which can retract the eye for protection. Homologous abducens nerves are found in all vertebrates except lampreys and hagfishes.

<text>Victory in Europe Day is the day celebrating the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender of its armed forces on Tuesday, 8 May 1945; it marked the official end of World War II in Europe in the Eastern Front, with the last known shots fired on 11 May.

Russia and some former Soviet countries celebrate on 9 May, as Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender entered into force at 23:01 on 8 May Central European Summer Time; this corresponded with 00:01 on 9 May in Moscow Time.

Several countries observe public holidays on the day each year, also called Victory Over Fascism Day, Liberation Day, or Victory Day. In the UK it is often abbreviated to VE Day, a term which existed as early as September 1944, in anticipation of victory.

==History==

Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, had committed suicide on 30 April during the Battle of Berlin, and Germany&#x27;s surrender was authorised by his successor, &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was first signed at 02:41 on 7 May in SHAEF HQ at Reims, and a slightly modified document, considered the definitive German Instrument of Surrender, was signed on 8 May 1945 in Karlshorst, Berlin at 22:43 local time.

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the Western world, especially in the United Kingdom, in North America and in USSR. More than one million people celebrated in the streets throughout the UK to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by their daughters and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Churchill went from the palace to Whitehall, where he addressed another large crowd:


Churchill asked Ernest Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said, &quot;No, Winston, this is your day&quot;, and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;. Later, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. The 2015 film &quot;A Royal Night Out&quot; was inspired by Elizabeth and Margaret mingling with the public that night.

In the United States, the event coincided with President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April. Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt&#x27;s memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was &quot;that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day&quot;. Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. Great celebrations took place in many American cities, especially in New York&#x27;s Times Square.

Tempering the jubilation somewhat, both Churchill and Truman pointed out that the war against Japan had not yet been won. In his radio broadcast at 15:00 on 8 May, Churchill told the British people, &quot;We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing (as Japan) remains unsubdued&quot;. In America, Truman broadcast at 09:00 and said it was &quot;a victory only half won&quot;.

On the same day in 1945, Muslims in French Algeria celebrating the end of the war (of which some were also peacefully protesting for independence) became the targets of violence and massacres by colonial authorities and &quot;pied-noir&quot; settler militias, which would last until 26 June 1945. While details of the killings were largely overlooked in metropolitan France, the impact on the Algerian Muslim population was traumatic, especially on the large numbers of Muslim soldiers in the French Army who were then returning from the war in Europe. Nine years later, the Algerian War began, leading to independence from France in March 1962. In February 2005, Hubert Colin de Verdière, France&#x27;s ambassador to Algeria, formally apologized for the massacre, calling it an &quot;inexcusable tragedy&quot;.

== National celebrations ==
VE Day is celebrated across European nations as public holidays and national observances.

=== Austria ===
The Festival of Joy is an Austrian event held in honor of VE Day. The Austrian Mauthausen Committee (MKÖ) has organised the Festival of Joy since 2013, in cooperation with the Austrian Government and the City of Vienna. The festival is held annually on Heldenplatz.

On the eve of the diamond jubilee in 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the request of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, gave a live address broadcast on Austrian TV channel ORF.

=== France ===
France celebrates VE Day on 8 May, being a national and public holiday. Orléans simultaneously celebrates both VE Day and the anniversary of the Siege of Orléans being lifted on this date by French forces led by Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years War.

=== Germany ===
Events in Berlin occur on 8 May to commemorate those who fought against Nazism in the German Resistance and died in World War II. In 2020, a regional holiday in Berlin occurred on 8 May to mark the 75th anniversary of surrender. East Germany celebrated 8 May as its &quot;Tag der Befreiung&quot; (Liberation Day), first celebrated under Walter Ulbricht&#x27;s government in 1950 and repeated annually until the fall of communism. Between 1975 and 1990, it was &quot;Tag des Sieges&quot; (Victory Day).

=== Poland ===
8 May is known in Poland as &quot;Narodowy Dzień Zwycięstwa&quot; (National Victory Day). Poland officially recognised 9 May from 1945 until 2014, and on 24 April 2015, Poland officially recognised National Victory Day. On 8 May 1945, a meeting of the Council of Ministers was held, debating whether to establish the holiday on 8 May (proposed by Marshal Michał Rola-Żymierski) or 10 May (proposed by the government). Finally, in Poland, the National Day of Victory and Freedom was established on 9 May by decree. 

From 1946 to 1989, it was celebrated with Russian traditions, as Poland was a socialist state at the time. The main celebrations were carried out at Plac Zwycięstwa or Plac Defilad in Warsaw (most notably in 1985). 

After 1990 and the fall of the Soviet Union, no official ceremonies were organized; however, many cities and military units together with local governments organized their own festivities. The Russian minority in Poland continues to celebrate 9 May traditions to this date. At the end of March 2015, due to the upcoming 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, the President of the Institute of National Remembrance Łukasz Kamiński sent a letter to the Marshal of the Sejm requesting a change from 9 to 8 May. On 24 April, the Sejm adopted the Act on National Victory Day to be celebrated on 8 May, at the same time abolishing the National Day of Victory and Freedom celebrated on 9 May.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, VE Day is not an annual public holiday. In 1995 and 2020, the bank holiday was moved from the preceding Monday to 8 May to commemorate the 50th and 75th anniversaries of VE Day, respectively.

=== Commemorative events ===
*: In Belgium, the commemoration of the termination of World War II since 1974 has been part of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 (Dutch: Wapenstilstandsdag), an annual national holiday. Every year on this day, a truce-ceremony is held in the presence of the king at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Congress Column in Brussels. It was first intended to commemorate the victims of the First World War and subsequently those of World War II and all other wars worldwide.
*: Since the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic has officially recognized 8 May as Victory Day (&quot;Den vítězství&quot;) Liberation Day (&quot;Den osvobození&quot;). In recent years the liberation of Plzeň by American forces has been commemorated on 5 May. From 1948 to 1993, the Czechoslovak Republic celebrated 9 May, which was marked with a military parade of the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army (ČSLA) on Letná every five years. 
*: 9 May is Europe Day which celebrates &quot;peace and unity in Europe&quot;, on the anniversary of the 1950 Schuman Declaration.
* Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania officially commemorate 8 May, but do not commemorate 9 May since it marked the Soviet occupation in 1944 for these states. Despite this, the local Russian communities still informally celebrate 9 May. Russian diplomats, other representatives from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and local politicians of Russian origin usually take part.

==List of associated holidays==
===Soviet Victory Day===

The instrument of surrender signed 7 May 1945 stipulated that all hostilities must cease at 23:01 (CET), 8 May 1945. Since that point in time would be on 9 May in local time in the Soviet Union, most Soviet states including Russia celebrated Victory Day on 9 May.

Helmet initially signed to Amphetamine Reptile Records, releasing a number of 7&quot; singles and one album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Strap It On&quot;. The band then signed to Interscope Records, releasing &quot;Meantime&quot; (1992), &quot;Betty&quot; (1994) and &quot;Aftertaste&quot; (1997). After a seven-year hiatus, the band returned with &quot;Size Matters&quot; (2004). A year after the release of &quot;Size Matters&quot;, they left Interscope, and the band released the albums &quot;Monochrome&quot; (2006), &quot;Seeing Eye Dog&quot; (2010), &quot;Dead to the World&quot; (2016) and &quot;Left&quot; (2023).

&quot;Meantime&quot; was the band&#x27;s principal commercial success, being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album was well received by music critics and is seen as an influential metal record and earning a Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category for 1993.

Since 2004, Hamilton has been the only founding member left in Helmet, and after the departure of guitarist Chris Traynor in 2006, he has been the only member to have been involved with Helmet during its original run in the 1990s. Hamilton has said that he hopes to keep playing with Helmet until he is &quot;physically incapable&quot;.

===Gandhi===
Following Helmet&#x27;s temporary dissolution in the late 1990s, Hamilton formed another rock band, Gandhi, with former Liege Lord guitarist Anthony Truglio, John Andrews (guitar), Christian Bongers (bass), and Matt Flynn (later the drummer for Maroon 5). Though the band did not release any music officially, several demo songs were leaked. Many of these were later recorded for the &quot;Size Matters&quot; and &quot;Monochrome&quot; releases by Helmet.

=== Movie soundtracks ===
While still active with Helmet, Hamilton embarked on a career composing and performing music for film, working on movies including &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;In Dreams&quot;, &quot;Catwoman&quot;, and &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;. Helmet also contributed to a number of movie soundtracks, including &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, &quot;Judgment Night&quot;, &quot;Saw 3&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, and appearing in &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot; (performing a cover of the Black Sabbath song &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;).

=== Production ===
Hamilton has also worked as a record producer, most notably producing the album &quot;Distort Yourself&quot; by former Bush singer Gavin Rossdale&#x27;s band Institute. He has also produced albums for the bands Bullets and Octane (&quot;In the Mouth of the Young&quot;), Classic Case (&quot;Losing at Life&quot;), and Totimoshi.

=== David Bowie, collaborations, other work ===
During Helmet&#x27;s hiatus, Hamilton performed as lead guitarist for David Bowie&#x27;s band on the singer&#x27;s Hours Tour.

He has collaborated with German avant-garde guitarist Caspar Brötzmann on the live improvisational album &quot;Zulutime&quot; and performed on a number of other artists&#x27; works, including trumpeter Ben Neill&#x27;s &quot;Goldbug&quot;, alt-country songwriter Joe Henry&#x27;s &quot;Trampoline&quot;, Northern Irish rock band Therapy?&#x27;s &quot;Troublegum&quot; and British post-punk group Wire&#x27;s &quot;Object 47&quot;.

As a jazz musician, he has performed with his own groups, the Page Hamilton Quintet and the Jazz Wannabes, and with fellow guitarist and mentor John Stowell.

He has also produced a guitar instruction DVD, &quot;Sonic Shapes: Expanding Rock Guitar Vocabulary&quot;, published by Hal Leonard Corporation.

During the spring of 2008, Page provided guest vocals on post-hardcore band Norma Jean&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;The Anti Mother&quot; as well as contributed to the writing of track 8, &quot;Opposite of Left and Wrong&quot;.

In 2014, Hamilton appeared on Linkin Park&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, which he provided additional vocals (on the chorus) and guitars on the album&#x27;s second track &quot;All for Nothing&quot;. The song was self-produced by Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson.

==Personal life==
Hamilton was married during the 1990s, but later divorced. At the beginning of 2002, he moved to Los Angeles, citing the rising cost of living in New York as a reason for the move. The following year he entered a year long relationship with American actress Winona Ryder. According to Hamilton, she was a listener of the band, and many of the lyrics on Helmet&#x27;s 2004 comeback &quot;Size Matters&quot; were reportedly inspired by their relationship. Hamilton has mentioned that he has been mistaken for a woman at times because of his name, which is pronounced the same way as the female name &quot;Paige&quot;.

==Equipment==
Hamilton endorsed ESP Guitars in the 1990s, and is best known for playing ESP Horizon guitars with either a Floyd Rose or Wilkinson tremolo, and DiMarzio Airzone pickups. In 2006 ESP announced a Page Hamilton signature model, featuring a single DiMarzio Airzone pickup and Wilkinson tremolo. In 2009, ESP announced a further signature model guitar, this time modeled after Page&#x27;s own ESP Horizon Custom, featuring a distressed magenta finish emulating the original guitar&#x27;s road wear and character and, again, a single DiMarzio Air Zone pickup. He has also used guitars by PRS and G&amp;L.

For live performances, Page Hamilton uses a Fryette Pittbull Ultra-Lead into a Fryette Fatbottom 4x12 cabinet. In the 1990s, Hamilton used a Harry Kolbe preamp into a Marshall 2204S (small-box head) with its gain all the way up, then into a dummy load, then into a noise gate, then finally into a Mesa Boogie Simul-class 290 power amplifier that fed four Harry Kolbe 4x12 cabinets.

<text>The Civil Justice Fairness Act (, ) was proposed to limit the amount of monetary compensation awardable in civil case to a maximum of either $250,000 or 300% of the economic damage caused by the defendant; whichever was greater. Opponents of this act argued that federal restrictions of this sort would illegally preempt state authority.

The bill was a combination of two preceding bills. First, the &quot;Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995&quot; (), was passed by the US Congress, but was vetoed by President Clinton. Second, the &quot;Attorney Accountability Act of 1995&quot; () passed the house.

<doc id="215260" wikidata="Q242160" url="?curid=215260" title="Facial nerve">
<text>The facial nerve, also known as the seventh cranial nerve, cranial nerve VII, or simply CN VII, is a cranial nerve that emerges from the pons of the brainstem, controls the muscles of facial expression, and functions in the conveyance of taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The nerve typically travels from the pons through the facial canal in the temporal bone and exits the skull at the stylomastoid foramen. It arises from the brainstem from an area posterior to the cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) and anterior to cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve).

The facial nerve also supplies preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to several head and neck ganglia.

The facial and intermediate nerves can be collectively referred to as the nervus intermediofacialis.

==Structure==
The path of the facial nerve can be divided into six segments:
# intracranial (cisternal) segment (from brainstem pons to internal auditory canal)
# meatal (canalicular) segment (within the internal auditory canal)
# labyrinthine segment (internal auditory canal to geniculate ganglion)
# tympanic (or horizontal) segment (from geniculate ganglion to pyramidal eminence)
# mastoid (or vertical) segment (from pyramidal eminence to stylomastoid foramen)
# extratemporal segment (from stylomastoid foramen to post parotid branches)
The motor part of the facial nerve arises from the facial nerve nucleus in the pons, while the sensory and parasympathetic parts of the facial nerve arise from the intermediate nerve.

From the brain stem, the motor and sensory parts of the facial nerve join and traverse the posterior cranial fossa before entering the petrous temporal bone via the internal auditory meatus. Upon exiting the internal auditory meatus, the nerve then runs a tortuous course through the facial canal, which is divided into the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments.

The labyrinthine segment is the shortest and narrowest segment of the facial nerve and ends where the facial nerve forms a bend known as the geniculum of the facial nerve (&quot;genu&quot; meaning knee), which contains the geniculate ganglion for sensory nerve bodies. The first branch of the facial nerve, the greater petrosal nerve, arises here from the geniculate ganglion. The greater petrosal nerve runs through the pterygoid canal and synapses at the pterygopalatine ganglion. Postsynaptic fibers of the greater petrosal nerve innervate the lacrimal gland.

In the tympanic segment, the facial nerve runs through the tympanic cavity, medial to the incus.

The pyramidal eminence is the second bend in the facial nerve, where the nerve runs downward as the mastoid segment, the longest segment of the facial nerve. In the temporal part of the facial canal, the nerve gives branch to the stapedius muscle and chorda tympani. The chorda tympani supplies taste fibers to the anterior two thirds of the tongue, and also synapses with the submandibular ganglion. Postsynaptic fibers from the submandibular ganglion supply the sublingual and submandibular glands.

Upon emerging from the stylomastoid foramen, the facial nerve gives rise to the posterior auricular branch. It then gives rise to the branch to the posterior belly of the digastric, and then the branch to the stylohyoid. The facial nerve then passes through the parotid gland, which it does not innervate, to form the parotid plexus. The nerve then bifurcates at the pes anserinus to become the upper and lower divisions of the facial nerve. It then splits into five branches (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical), innervating the muscles of facial expression.

===Intracranial branches===
The greater petrosal nerve arises at the superior salivatory nucleus of the pons and provides parasympathetic innervation to several glands, including the nasal glands, the palatine glands, the lacrimal gland, and the pharyngeal gland. It also provides parasympathetic innervation to the sphenoid sinus, frontal sinus, maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, and nasal cavity. This nerve also includes taste fibers for the palate via the lesser palatine nerve and greater palatine nerve.

The communicating branch to the otic ganglion arises at the geniculate ganglion and joins the lesser petrosal nerve to reach the otic ganglion.

The nerve to stapedius provides motor innervation for the stapedius muscle in middle ear

The chorda tympani provides parasympathetic innervation to the sublingual and submandibular glands, as well as special sensory taste fibers for the anterior two thirds of the tongue.

===Extracranial branches===
Distal to stylomastoid foramen, the following nerves branch off the facial nerve: 
* Posterior auricular nerve which controls movements of some of the scalp muscles around the ear
* Branch to posterior belly of digastric muscle
* Branch of the stylohyoid muscle
* Five major facial branches (at parotid plexus) – from superior to inferior:
** Temporal branch
** Zygomatic branch
** Buccal branch
** Marginal mandibular branch
** Cervical branch

# At the tip of tragus where the nerve is 1 cm deep and inferior
# At the posterior belly of digastric by tracing this backwards to the tympanic plate, the nerve can be found between these two structures
# By locating the posterior facial vein at the inferior aspect of the gland where the marginal branch would be seen crossing it.
#Lateral semicircular canal
# Foot of incus

===Nucleus===
The cell bodies for the facial nerve are grouped in anatomical areas called nuclei or ganglia. The cell bodies for the afferent nerves are found in the geniculate ganglion for taste sensation. The cell bodies for muscular efferent nerves are found in the facial motor nucleus whereas the cell bodies for the parasympathetic efferent nerves are found in the superior salivatory nucleus.

===Development===
The facial nerve is developmentally derived from the second pharyngeal arch, or branchial arch. The second arch is called the hyoid arch because it contributes to the formation of the lesser horn and upper body of the hyoid bone (the rest of the hyoid is formed by the third arch). The facial nerve supplies motor and sensory innervation to the muscles formed by the second pharyngeal arch, including the muscles of facial expression, the posterior belly of the digastric, stylohyoid, and stapedius. The motor division of the facial nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, while the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest.

Although the anterior two thirds of the tongue are derived from the first pharyngeal arch, which gives rise to the trigeminal nerve, not all innervation of the tongue is supplied by it. The lingual branch of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve supplies non-taste sensation (pressure, heat, texture) to the anterior part of the tongue via general somatic afferent fibers. Nerve fibers for taste are supplied by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve via special visceral afferent fibers.

== Function ==

===Facial expression===
The main function of the facial nerve is motor control of all the muscles of facial expression. It also innervates the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, the stylohyoid muscle, and the stapedius muscle of the middle ear. These skeletal muscles are developed from the second pharyngeal arch.

===Facial sensation===
In addition, the facial nerve receives taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani. Taste sensation is sent to the gustatory portion (superior part) of the solitary nucleus. General sensation from the anterior two-thirds of tongue are supplied by afferent fibers of the third division of the fifth cranial nerve (CN V-3). These sensory (CN V3) and taste (VII) fibers travel together as the lingual nerve briefly before the chorda tympani leaves the lingual nerve to enter the tympanic cavity (middle ear) via the petrotympanic fissure. It joins the rest of the facial nerve via the canaliculus for chorda tympani. The facial nerve then forms the geniculate ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of the taste fibers of chorda tympani and other taste and sensory pathways. From the geniculate ganglion, the taste fibers continue as the intermediate nerve which goes to the upper anterior quadrant of the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus along with the motor root of the facial nerve. The intermediate nerve reaches the posterior cranial fossa via the internal acoustic meatus before synapsing in the solitary nucleus.

The facial nerve also supplies a small amount of afferent innervation to the oropharynx below the palatine tonsil. There is also a small amount of cutaneous sensation carried by the nervus intermedius from the skin in and around the auricle (outer ear).

===Other===

The facial nerve also supplies parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular gland and sublingual glands via chorda tympani. Parasympathetic innervation serves to increase the flow of saliva from these glands. It also supplies parasympathetic innervation to the nasal mucosa and the lacrimal gland via the pterygopalatine ganglion. The parasympathetic fibers that travel in the facial nerve originate in the superior salivatory nucleus.

The facial nerve also functions as the efferent limb of the corneal reflex.

===Functional components===
The facial nerve carries axons of type GSA, general somatic afferent, to skin of the posterior ear.

The facial nerve also carries axons of type GVE, general visceral efferent, which innervate the sublingual, submandibular, and lacrimal glands, also mucosa of nasal cavity.

Axons of type SVE, special visceral efferent, innervate muscles of facial expression, stapedius, the posterior belly of digastric, and the stylohyoid.

The axons of type SVA, special visceral afferent, provide taste to the anterior two-thirds of tongue via chorda tympani.

==Clinical significance==

===Palsy===

People may suffer from acute facial nerve paralysis, which is usually manifested by facial paralysis. Bell&#x27;s palsy is one type of idiopathic acute facial nerve paralysis, which is more accurately described as a multiple cranial nerve ganglionitis that involves the facial nerve, and most likely results from viral infection and also sometimes as a result of Lyme disease. Iatrogenic Bell&#x27;s palsy may also be as a result of an incorrectly placed dental local-anesthetic (inferior alveolar nerve block). Although giving the appearance of a hemiplegic stroke, effects dissipate with the drug. When the facial nerve is permanently damaged due to a birth defect, trauma, or other disorder, surgery including a cross facial nerve graft or masseteric facial nerve transfer may be performed to help regain facial movement. Facial nerve decompression surgery is also sometimes carried out in certain cases of facial nerve compression.

===Examination===
Voluntary facial movements, such as wrinkling the brow, showing teeth, frowning, closing the eyes tightly (inability to do so is called lagophthalmos), pursing the lips and puffing out the cheeks, all test the facial nerve. There should be no noticeable asymmetry.

In an upper motor neuron lesion, called central seven, only the lower part of the face on the contralateral side will be affected, due to the bilateral control to the upper facial muscles (frontalis and orbicularis oculi).

Lower motor neuron lesions can result in a CN VII palsy (Bell&#x27;s palsy is the idiopathic form of facial nerve palsy), manifested as both upper and lower facial weakness on the same side of the lesion.

Taste can be tested on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This can be tested with a swab dipped in a flavored solution, or with electronic stimulation (similar to putting your tongue on a battery).

Corneal reflex. The afferent arc is mediated by the general sensory afferents of the trigeminal nerve. The efferent arc occurs via the facial nerve. The reflex involves consensual blinking of both eyes in response to stimulation of one eye. This is due to the facial nerves&#x27; innervation of the muscles of facial expression, namely orbicularis oculi, responsible for blinking. Thus, the corneal reflex effectively tests the proper functioning of both cranial nerves V and VII.

<doc id="215261" wikidata="Q2975523" url="?curid=215261" title="Civil Code of Quebec">
<text>The Civil Code of Quebec (CCQ, , ) is the civil code in force in the Canadian province of Quebec, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. It replaced the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot; () enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1865, which had been in force since August 1, 1866.

The &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot; governs a number of areas affecting relations between individuals under Quebec law. It deals with the main rules governing the law of persons, the family, succession, property and civil liability. It also contains rules of evidence in civil matters and Quebec private international law. 

==Scope==
The Code&#x27;s scope is summarized in its preliminary provision:

The Civil Code is in essence a body of rules and regulations that, in all matters treated by or in the spirit or vein of its provisions, sets forth the &quot;jus commune&quot;, or the law that applies to all of Quebec, either in express or implied terms. For the matters handled by the Code, it acts as the foundation of all other adjacent laws, although other laws may supplement the Code or make exceptions to it.&quot;

As the cornerstone of Quebec&#x27;s legal system, the Civil Code is frequently amended in order to keep in step with the demands of modern society.

===Layout and significant changes===
The &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot; comprises over 3,000 articles and is structured into major divisions and subdivisions called books, titles, chapters and subsections. The Code is made up of ten books:

#Persons
#The Family
#Successions
#Property
#Obligations
#Prior Claims and Hypothecs
#Evidence
#Prescription
#Publication of Rights
#Private International Law

The &quot;Code&quot; restatement of the civil law in Quebec as of the date of its adoption, including judicial interpretation of codal provisions, that included several significant changes from the former Code:

:* broad privacy and personality rights protection,
:* the adoption of rules on patrimonies by appropriation (analogous to, but conceptually different from, the law of trusts in common law jurisdictions),
:* the introduction of a requirement for parties to conduct themselves in good faith
:* the ability to create unincorporated associations with the ability to sue and be sued
:* the ability to create hypothecs on movable property
:* the introduction of a central register for personal and movable real rights
:* the codification of the rules relating to private international law

==History ==

===Adoption of the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot;===

The substantive law of the 1866 &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot; was derived primarily from the judicial interpretations of the law that had been in force to that date in Lower Canada. The work of the Commission on codification was also inspired by some of the modernizations found in the 1804 Napoleonic code. At the time of Canadian Confederation, the Civil Code of Lower Canada replaced most of the laws inherited from the Custom of Paris and incorporated some English law as it had been applied in Lower Canada such as the English law of trusts. The former Civil Code was also inspired by the Louisiana Civil Code, the Field Code movement in New York, and the Civil Code of the Canton of Vaud (1819).

===Revision process (1955–1991)===
In 1955, the Government of Quebec embarked on a reform of the Civil Code. The Civil Code Revision Office was established, headed by Thibaudeau Rinfret, a former Chief Justice of Canada. In 1960, the role of the Office was expanded to include the appointment of four codifiers to work on a definitive draft for the new Code.

In 1961, Rinfret stepped down from the Office, and was replaced by André Nadeau who served until his appointment to the Superior Court of Quebec in 1964. Paul-André Crépeau was subsequently appointed to head the Office, where he served until 1977.

The reform process that led to the replacement of the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot; by the &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot; was one of the largest legislative recodification undertakings in any civil law jurisdiction. The Office produced reports, held consultations, and presented a Draft Civil Code with commentaries to the Quebec National Assembly on 15 August 1977. After further consultations during the 1980s, portions of the Book on the Law of the Family were adopted. The consultation process continued through to the early 1990s.

===Implementation (1991–1994)===
The bill to enact the new Code was introduced into the National Assembly of Quebec on 18 December 1990 by Gil Rémillard, who was then Quebec&#x27;s Minister of Justice. It received royal assent on 8 December 1991. It did not come into force until 1 January 1994, as the necessary legislation to provide transitional rules determining what matters would be subject to the new Code was not passed until 1992.

===Harmonization with federal law===
The Government of Canada has been undertaking a review of all federal laws that deal with private law to ensure that they take into consideration the terminology, concepts and institutions of Quebec civil law. In that regard, the following Acts have been passed:
:* &quot;Income Tax Amendments Act, 2000&quot;
:* &quot;Federal Law—Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1&quot;
:* &quot;Federal Law—Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 2&quot;
:* &quot;Federal Law—Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 3&quot;

As part of the first Harmonization Act, the &quot;Federal Law and Civil Law of the Province of Quebec Act&quot; was passed, which came into effect on 1 June 2001, which:
:* repealed the provisions of the &quot;CCLC&quot; relating to areas under federal jurisdiction (insofar as they had not been already displaced by other federal Acts)
:* standardized the rules relating to marriage that are to apply in Quebec as though they formed part of the &quot;Civil Code&quot;

It is estimated that, as of 2011, the federal harmonization project was 46% complete.

<text>Helmet is an American alternative metal band from New York City formed in 1989 by vocalist and lead guitarist Page Hamilton. Helmet has had numerous lineup changes with Hamilton as the only constant member. Since 2010, the band has consisted of Hamilton, drummer Kyle Stevenson, guitarist Dan Beeman and bassist Dave Case.

Helmet has released nine studio albums and two compilation albums. After releasing their debut album, &quot;Strap It On&quot; (1990), on Amphetamine Reptile, Helmet signed to Interscope Records and released three albums for the label, including the highly successful &quot;Meantime&quot; (1992). Their next two albums ― &quot;Betty&quot; (1994) and &quot;Aftertaste&quot; (1997) ― were also successful, but did not match the critical or popular acclaim of &quot;Meantime&quot;. Helmet broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2004, and has since released five more albums ― &quot;Size Matters&quot; (2004), &quot;Monochrome&quot; (2006), &quot;Seeing Eye Dog&quot; (2010), &quot;Dead to the World&quot; (2016), and their latest, &quot;Left&quot; (2023).

==History==
===Formation and early years (1989–1991)===
Hamilton formed Helmet in early 1989 after leaving the alternative rock group Band of Susans, with whom he had recorded two albums. Having originally moved to New York to study jazz guitar at the Manhattan School of Music, the Oregon born guitarist recruited bassist Henry Bogdan who was also from Oregon, Australian guitarist Peter Mengede and Floridian drummer John Stanier as the group&#x27;s first official line-up. Before Hamilton had settled on a name, the guitarist Peter Mengede&#x27;s then-wife Reyne Cuccuro suggested the Germanic name &quot;Helmuth&quot;. Hamilton misinterpreted her and mistakenly believed that she was referring to the form of protective gear. Hamilton then thought excitedly that Helmet had &quot;sounded like a pretty cool name for a band&quot; and opted for the Anglicized spelling. Other names taken in consideration were &quot;Cry Ruth&quot; and &quot;Poly Orchids&quot;, along with the more esoteric and obscure &quot;Tuna Lorenzo&quot; and &quot;Froth Albumen&quot;.

They were spotted by Tom Hazelmyer, guitarist of the band Halo of Flies, and signed to Hazelmyer&#x27;s label Amphetamine Reptile Records, releasing their first 7 inch single, &quot;Born Annoying&quot;, later that year(Released in album form with more tracks in 1995). Amphetamine Reptile released Helmet&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Strap It On&quot; in 1990, selling over 40,000 copies soon thereafter. Hazelmyer once stated that the album kept the label going through the 1990s.

===Commercial successes (1992–1998)===
Although &quot;Strap It On&quot; had achieved significant local success, major record labels were not interested in signing Helmet until after Nirvana achieved mainstream success in 1991, bringing the alternative music scene into the mainstream. Sometime thereafter, the band began receiving major label record deals from Relativity, Warner Bros. and Interscope Records. In January 1992, Helmet signed to Interscope, receiving a $1.2 million dollar advance split between three albums ($400,000 per record), $50,000 worth of tour support, and an unprecedented amount of control over their work. Their first album for Interscope, &quot;Meantime&quot;, was released in 1992 and certified gold in 1994. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide and remains Helmet&#x27;s top-selling album. Helmet toured the United States, Brazil, Europe, and Asia relentlessly, generally with other AmRep recording artists. Internal tensions rose high at times.

In early 1993, Peter Mengede left Helmet due to a contractual dispute. He would later join the supergroup Handsome in 1995, which released one album on Epic Records in 1997 before disbanding. Mengede was replaced by Rob Echeverria, guitarist from the hardcore band Rest in Pieces. Helmet collaborated with House of Pain on the song &quot;Just Another Victim&quot; for the Judgment Night soundtrack. Helmet&#x27;s third album, &quot;Betty&quot;, was released in 1994. Despite managing the band&#x27;s highest-ever chart position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 45, the album did not sell as many copies as &quot;Meantime&quot;. In 1995, the band appeared in &quot;The Jerky Boys: The Movie&quot;, covering Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; with Ozzy Osbourne making a cameo appearance as the band&#x27;s manager. Later, after recording and touring in support of &quot;Betty&quot;, Echeverria made an amicable departure from the band to join Biohazard.

Helmet pushed on to record 1997&#x27;s &quot;Aftertaste&quot; as a three-piece. A first version of the album had been withdrawn at the last minute in the fall of 1996 when promotional activities had already begun, delaying the disc&#x27;s release to March of the following year with a new audio mix. Guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the tour to support the album. While the song &quot;Exactly What You Wanted&quot; became a moderate radio hit, the album did not fare as well as Helmet&#x27;s prior major label releases, spending a few weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling 132,000 copies over the next decade. The &quot;Aftertaste Tour&quot; in 1997 would prove to be the band&#x27;s last for nearly a decade.

Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits, with Helmet&#x27;s original final performance occurring in Italy on December 10, 1997. The band officially broke up in November 1998. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, &quot;9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and we found it hard to look at each other anymore&quot;. Bogdan formed the Moonlighters in New York with Bliss Blood, for whom he played steel guitar, before returning home to Oregon to play for the Midnight Serenaders. Stanier took a break from drumming, but returned to play drums for Tomahawk, The Mark of Cain, Battles and Primer 55.

===Reunion (2003–present)===

Following Helmet&#x27;s disbandment, Hamilton relocated from New York to Los Angeles and became involved in a variety of projects. This included playing guitar for David Bowie, doing sessions for film scores, working with composer Elliot Goldenthal on the 1999 soundtracks to &quot;In Dreams&quot; and &quot;Titus.&quot; It was Hamilton&#x27;s second time working with Goldenthal, the first being the 1995 soundtrack to the movie &quot;Heat&quot;. When working on film scores, he was part of a &quot;guitar orchestra&quot; called &quot;Deaf Elk&quot; with other guitarists. He periodically returned to New York to work with his band Gandhi, which is where several of the songs appearing on &quot;Size Matters&quot; began.

In August 2003, Hamilton began working on a new musical project with Chris Traynor and drummer John Tempesta (formerly of Testament and White Zombie). Around this time, Interscope Records announced the release of the greatest hits compilation &quot;&quot; (2004), sparking speculation about a Helmet reunion and tour that was quickly denied by a spokesperson for Hamilton. In December 2003, Hamilton signed a new contract with Interscope; he was later urged by Interscope head Jimmy Iovine to record a new album for the label under the Helmet moniker. Having found it difficult to maintain Gandhi financially, Hamilton agreed to do so as &quot;it meant I&#x27;d have money to make a record rather than it coming out of my pocket. So it was easier to put a band together.&quot; As his relationships with Stanier and Bogdan had not improved since 1998, and his previous offers to reunite had been rebuffed or ignored, Hamilton decided to move on and release more music as Helmet without them.

With Tempesta on drums and Hamilton covering vocals and guitar, the three recorded &quot;Size Matters&quot; in early 2004. Traynor recorded both the album&#x27;s guitar and bass parts. The album featured lyrics which were inspired by Hamilton&#x27;s brief 2003 relationship with Hollywood actress Winona Ryder, and has been cited by critics as a departure from Helmet&#x27;s earlier, more experimental sound. Frank Bello was later recruited to play bass on the supporting tour; however, he left before its conclusion to reunite with his original band, Anthrax. Jeremy Chatelain replaced Bello for the duration of the tour. John Tempesta left in early 2006 to join The Cult.

In November 2005, Helmet were dropped by Interscope following lackluster sales for &quot;Size Matters&quot;. Helmet then signed with Warcon Enterprises in March 2006 and announced that a new album was in the works. Helmet performed at the 2006 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with a temporary lineup consisting of Charlie Walker on drums, Chris Traynor on bass, and Anthony Truglio (formerly of Gandhi) on guitar. The new album, &quot;Monochrome&quot;, was recorded and co-produced by Wharton Tiers, who recorded Helmet&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Strap It On&quot; and &quot;Meantime&quot;. For the album, Hamilton and Traynor returned to the studio with newly recruited drummer, Mike Jost (formerly of Adair). Helmet headlined the 2006 Warped Tour in support of &quot;Monochrome&quot;, with Jeremy Chatelain reprising his role from the 2005 &quot;Size Matters&quot; tour. The band later split with Warcon due to a variety of financial disputes between Hamilton and the label&#x27;s owners. Hamilton stated &quot;Amphetamine Reptile and Interscope were both fantastic experiences for us, and Warcon was the first time that I&#x27;d actually run into any problems with a label. I trusted somebody and got screwed. I&#x27;m not bitter about it, but I lost a lot of money. They never paid me tour support that they were contractually obligated to pay. There were a lot of things. I&#x27;ve never seen one penny of royalties from them, but I own the record [&quot;Monochrome&quot;] now, so it&#x27;s my record.&quot;

In September 2006, Chris Traynor announced that he had left the band after nearly a decade of working with Page Hamilton. A few days later, Mike Jost also left the band to attend to his duties as a new father. Jeremy Chatelain also made other commitments. Hamilton announced in early October 2006 that drum and bass duties would be filled by Kyle Stevenson and Jon Fuller, respectively, both from Milwaukee, and both previously members of Big Collapse. Australian Jimmy Thompson (formerly of Full Scale) also joined the band on guitar in 2006, but was replaced by Dan Beeman by late 2008. Due to line-up changes, Hamilton was forced to cancel many shows scheduled for late 2006 in the U.S. and Europe. Helmet opened up for Guns N&#x27; Roses for the remaining dates of their tour in December 2006. The band toured Australia in April and May 2008, playing shows throughout the eastern and southern coasts. Helmet&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Seeing Eye Dog&quot;, was released on September 7, 2010.
On November 20, 2011, Helmet announced the European &quot;Meantime&quot; Anniversary Tour running from March 5 to April 8, 2012, encompassing 28 shows in Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium and the UK during which they played the whole of the &quot;Meantime&quot; in its entirety&quot;.&quot; Mengede briefly reunited with Hamilton and Helmet during one of the anniversary shows in Brisbane, Australia.&quot;&quot;

On October 28, 2016, Helmet released their eighth studio album, &quot;Dead to the World&quot; after the release of the single &quot;Bad News&quot;.

The band announced tour dates for May 2018 in the U.S. and July-August in Europe on their official website. Helmet also celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2019 with a European and North American tour.

In November 2019, &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; reported that Helmet had been working on new material for their ninth studio album. On August 23, 2023, the band released &quot;Holiday&quot; as the lead single for their ninth album &quot;Left&quot;, which was released on November 10, 2023.

==Musical style and image==
Many critics cite Helmet as an alternative metal band; however, the band has been categorized under many genres, including post-hardcore, noise rock, experimental metal, post-metal and groove metal. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News jokingly labeled Helmet as &quot;smart rock&quot;.
Their music is characterized by repetitive, syncopated, staccato guitar riffs, often in unconventional time signatures, and almost always in a minor key with drop-D or drop-C tuning. The guitar sound is heavily distorted and dissonant, with choruses that often involve guitar feedback waves. Helmet has been described as a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s metal band&quot;; according to Hamilton, the term came from original drummer John Stanier because he once heard an interviewer say it.

Helmet have generally resisted the association with heavy metal, however. Hamilton has stated, &quot;People would say [to him], &#x27;You’re not metal!&#x27; and I’d say, &#x27;I know, I never said I was!&#x27; I dunno why people give a shit about what you’re meant to call yourselves.&quot;

Eschewing the traditional metal image of long hair and black clothing, the band stood out with their preference for simple T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers, and short haircuts. Their atypical look was referenced in an episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, in which the pair&#x27;s commentary on the video for &quot;Unsung&quot; included the lines &quot;That drummer looks like a regular guy&quot; and &quot;If you, like, saw these guys on the street, you wouldn&#x27;t even know they were cool.&quot;

==Legacy and influences==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Helmet &quot;a band that made important connections between indie-rock and metal.&quot; Helmet have been cited as an influence by a number of key nu metal and industrial metal bands, including Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and Fear Factory. Musician Mike Patton has also cited Helmet as having a significant influence on his solo career; with original drummer John Stanier and Patton having played together in Tomahawk. Helmet is considered a major influence on nu-metal, with the band&#x27;s use of Drop tuning influencing many in the genre. Hamilton, displeased with this connection, responded &quot;it&#x27;s frustrating that people write [us] off because we&#x27;re affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating nu-metal and rap metal or whatever the fuck it is, which we sound nothing like.&quot; Though Hamilton would eventually go on to work with bands Linkin Park and P.O.D.

Helmet has also been cited as an influence by post-hardcore acts Quicksand, Snapcase, and Orange 9mm. Regarding Helmet&#x27;s influence on rock, Hamilton remarked &quot;I hear it all over the place. I&#x27;ve heard Helmet riffs in Evanescence. Kids today have no idea at this point, because they [first] got into, say, Korn or System of a Down. Bands like Mastodon and Norma Jean tell me, &#x27;Oh, we ripped you guys off with this,&#x27; or &#x27;We got turned on by that.&#x27; Some bands do cool things with it, and there&#x27;s a bunch of shitty bands that have imitated us too.&quot;

In 2016, a tribute album titled &quot;Meantime Redux&quot; was released. It featured covers of 1990s Helmet songs (including all 10 songs from the &quot;Meantime&quot; album) by various underground hardcore bands. Deftones bassist Chi Cheng remarked &quot;Every band should wish to aspire to the originality and genius of Helmet. An inspiration to fans and musicians-alike&quot;. Norma Jean guitarist Chris Day recalled in 2006 &quot;The first song I ever learned to play on the guitar was a Helmet song. I pretty much just tried to figure the songs out and that&#x27;s how I learned to play basically. Helmet is a band that I have listened to for years and will always enjoy them because they have the sweetest riffs I have ever heard. I love to air drum to them in the car also. I wouldn&#x27;t be the same without Helmet in my life.&quot;

<text>Meantime is the second studio album and major label debut by American alternative metal band Helmet. It was released on June 23, 1992, through Interscope Records.

Despite initially only achieving moderate commercial success, peaking at number 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart upon release in 1992, the album influenced multiple bands in its wake, and has been well received by music critics and is considered an influential album of the metal genre. &quot;Meantime&quot; has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, and in 1994 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide.

The lead single from &quot;Meantime&quot;, &quot;Unsung&quot;, was a charting success on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, and remains Helmet&#x27;s best-known song. Music videos were made for &quot;Unsung&quot;, &quot;Give It&quot; and &quot;In the Meantime&quot;.

==Background==
After the release of their nine-song debut album &quot;Strap It On&quot;, the band found themselves at the center of a major label bidding war, eventually signing to Interscope for a reported budget of US$1 million. In the wake of the grunge band Nirvana&#x27;s recent success, many touted Helmet as the next big thing. Regarding the band&#x27;s label as &quot;the next Nirvana&quot;, frontman Page Hamilton said &quot;They were interested in us before Nirvana even broke. And that&#x27;s good, because we&#x27;re obviously not it. I actually had an A&amp;R guy at one label tell us that we were the next U2. At a certain point it just becomes ludicrous.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reflected in 2004 that Helmet played a &quot;heavier, more metallic&quot; style of music than grunge bands coming out of the Pacific Northwest in the early 1990s. Darren Cahr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote in 1992, &quot;this is a band that, despite lacking the basic pop appeal that brought Nirvana such a huge audience, crosses all borders.&quot; Cahr pointed out that their music was getting played on both &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; (a metal program) and &quot;120 Minutes&quot; (an alternative program).
===Recording===
&quot;Meantime&quot; was recorded by Wharton Tiers on a budget of $25,000. Recording sessions lasted two weeks; Mengede recorded his parts &quot;in an hour and a half or so of a morning.&quot; The song &quot;In the Meantime&quot; was recorded by Steve Albini and later remixed by Andy Wallace. Wallace would make additional changes to the album; the contrast between his style of mixing, which involves (among other things) triggered samples and a cleaner, more polished sound (leading to the album&#x27;s distinctive half-wood, half-metal snare drum sound), irritated Albini. Later, when in negotiations to record Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot;, he stipulated a clause be added to his contract stating that Wallace would not be allowed to remix the album, after he had mixed &quot;Nevermind&quot;, which was released nine months before &quot;Meantime&quot;.

===Artwork===
The album cover features an image of a man in a white protective suit shoveling some substance on the ground. It is taken from a photograph by David Plowden, &quot;Puddler In Blast Furnace Cast House, Steel Mill, East Chicago, Indiana (1979)&quot;.

The album is available with one of two reversely-colored covers; one has a blue background with a white-on-red Helmet logo, and the other has a red background with a white-on-blue Helmet logo (pictured above).

==Touring==
To support the album in 1992, Helmet opened for Faith No More, a band which, like Helmet, would later be credited with influencing the nu metal movement. These shows came about since the members of Faith No More wanted to have Helmet on their tour. In some promotional photos from 1992, Faith No More&#x27;s bassist Billy Gould can be seen wearing a Helmet shirt. Later in 1992, Helmet toured North America with metal bands Ministry and Sepultura, where they were consistently playing in front of crowds of several thousand people. During the tour, drummer John Stanier suffered injuries in a road accident, which led to Stone Temple Pilots filling in for Helmet on some of these dates.

In early 1993, the band went on a tour of the Pacific. They played their first shows in Peter Mengede&#x27;s home country of Australia in January 1993 at the Big Day Out festival. Following this, they performed in Japan and Hawaii. The Hawaii show would be Mengede&#x27;s last with Helmet, as he departed the band in February 1993, after disagreements with Page Hamilton over their songwriting process. Their 1993 show in Melbourne, Australia was released on &quot;Live and Rare&quot; in 2021, which was Helmet&#x27;s first official live album.

==Reception==
=== Commercial performance ===
&quot;Meantime&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in April 1992, being delayed until June of that year. The vinyl release of the album was handled by Amphetamine Reptile, who negotiated with Interscope to retain the vinyl rights to the band.

It became Helmet&#x27;s breakthrough album, and upon release peaked at number 68 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 Albums chart, and at number one on the Top Heatseekers chart. It also managed to chart outside of the US in 1992, by peaking at number 88 on the Australian ARIA Charts. It is still considered their most commercially successful release and, to date, it is the only Helmet album to go gold in the United States. Their follow-up album &quot;Betty&quot; charted in Canada, New Zealand and several European countries, in addition to charting at a higher position in the United States and Australia. However, it has sold a lower number of copies overall when compared to &quot;Meantime&quot;.

Andrew Earles of &quot;Spin&quot; that while Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; largely increased major label interest in alternative rock, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Metallica&quot; (1991) &quot;pointed a fair amount of attention towards the commercial potential of heavier forms of rock, then the surprise success of Helmet&#x27;s &quot;Meantime&quot; contributed to the same concern.&quot; Earles added that while &quot;Nevermind&quot; &quot;opened the primary floodgates&quot;, the surprise success of &quot;Meantime&quot; &quot;thoroghly hypnotized Interscope&quot;, who in turn &quot;extended the long arm of illogic&quot; far enough to unmarketable albums like Claw Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Thank the Holder Uppers&quot; (1995).

=== Critical reception ===
The album received positive reviews, John Franck of AllMusic labeled &quot;Meantime&quot; &quot;arguably one of the most influential and overlooked rock records of the &#x27;90s&quot;. He praised the music &quot;colored by Teutonic riffs, with only &#x27;Unsung&#x27; hinting at a gasp of commercial accessibility.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer David Browne gave it a B− in his August 1992 review, and remarked, &quot;call Helmet alternative metal. The New York band plays tightfisted speed-thrash, but without the overblown melodrama of the metal scene. (&#x27;To die young is far too boring these days,&#x27; sings Page Hamilton at one point.) Helmet is fascinating in theory and can crank up the decibels ably enough to have landed the once independent-label band a million-dollar contract with a major record company.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s Steffan Chirazi defined the album as &quot;a wall of angry, bitter and agonised New York street cries&quot;, giving it maximum ratings. Metal publication &quot;Hard Report&quot; wrote in 1992, &quot;one thing that differentiates them from the standard pack of &#x27;next big things&#x27; is that there&#x27;s not just &#x27;buzz&#x27; that surrounds this band. It&#x27;s more like a solid wall of noise.&quot; They further noted, &quot;the alternative types have been grooving to them since their debut 1990 release &quot;Strap It On&quot;. It seems a bit odd that metal never seemed to take more than a passing interest in them until recently.&quot;

==Legacy==
The sound of &quot;Meantime&quot;, with Page Hamilton&#x27;s staccato riffs, jazz-influenced chords and solos, and dual-voice singing style, proved influential to nu metal and alternative metal bands. The album, along with &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, is considered a definitive influence in post-metal. In November 1999, &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot; ranked &quot;Unsung&quot; 50th on a list of the &quot;Top 90 Essential Songs of the 90&#x27;s&quot;, labeling it an &quot;alt-metal masterpiece&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked &quot;Meantime&quot; as 48th on their list of the &quot;50 Most Influential Albums of All Time&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 54th on their 2017 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; ranked the album at number 157 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Alex Ogg wrote in the 2003 book &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; that it is &quot;one of the great hard-ass intensity records&quot;, and that &quot;parts of it make Rollins look like a lounge singer&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot; in 2021 remarked that it featured, &quot;some of the toughest riffs ever recorded&quot;. The following year, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Meantime&quot; 10th on their list of &quot;The 30 Greatest Rock Guitar Albums of 1992&quot;, stating, &quot;If you were to boldly claim that the importance of the (repetitive) riff replaced the significance of soloing in rock by &#x27;92, you could point directly to the sophomore effort by Helmet, &quot;Meantime&quot;. [Just] listen to guitarists Page Hamilton and Peter Mengede grind it out on such standouts as &#x27;In the Meantime&#x27;, &#x27;Iron Head&#x27;, and &#x27;Unsung&#x27; – while Hamilton shouts most of his vocals a la an irate drill instructor – to hear the proof.&quot; In 2022, &quot;Revolver&quot; also included it on their list of &quot;20 Great Albums from 1992&quot;. They stated that the band &quot;did little to tone down their abrasive sound&quot;, further adding that, &quot;single &#x27;Unsung&#x27; has its poppy moments, but still culminates in a decidedly radio-unfriendly one-and-a-half minute instrumental outro.&quot;

The songs &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, &quot;Ironhead&quot;, &quot;Give It&quot;, &quot;Unsung&quot; and &quot;Better&quot; were included on the 2004 compilation album &quot;&quot;. The track listing for the compilation was chosen by Page Hamilton. Instrumental versions of &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, &quot;Ironhead&quot;, &quot;Give It&quot; and &quot;Unsung&quot; also appeared on a promotional 2003 release titled &quot;The Instrumental Music of Helmet (1992–1997)&quot;. On September 16, 2016, Magnetic Eye Records released a compilation titled &quot;Meantime (Redux)&quot; that featured song-for-song covers of the original Helmet album by various artists including KEN mode, Fuck the Facts and Rosetta. Additionally, it also included six covers of songs from the band&#x27;s other original 1990s albums (&quot;Strap It On&quot;, &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Aftertaste&quot;).

<doc id="215266" wikidata="Q1783768" url="?curid=215266" title="Pinnacles National Park">
<text>Pinnacles National Park is a national park of the United States protecting a mountainous area located east of the Salinas Valley in Central California, about east of Soledad and southeast of San Jose. The park&#x27;s namesakes are the eroded leftovers of the western half of an extinct volcano that has moved from its original location on the San Andreas Fault, embedded in a portion of the California Pacific Coast Ranges. Pinnacles is managed by the National Park Service and the majority of the park is protected as wilderness.

The national park is divided by the rock formations into East and West Divisions, connected only by foot trails. The east side has shade and water, while the west has high walls. The rock formations provide for spectacular pinnacles that attract rock climbers. The park features unusual talus caves that house at least 13 species of bats. Pinnacles is most often visited in spring or fall because of the intense heat during the summer. Park lands are prime habitat for prairie falcons and are a release site for California condors that have been hatched in captivity.

Pinnacles was originally established as a national monument in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt, and was redesignated as a national park in 2013.

==History==

Native Americans in the Pinnacles region comprised the Chalon and Mutsun groups of the Ohlone people, who left stone artifacts in the park. These native people declined with the arrival of the Spanish in the 18th century, who brought novel diseases and changes to the natives&#x27; way of life. The establishment of a Spanish mission at Soledad hastened the area&#x27;s native depopulation through disease and dispersion. Archaeological surveys have found 13 sites inhabited by Native Americans, 12 of which antedate the establishment of the missions. One site is believed to be about 2000 years old. The last Chalon had died or departed from the area by 1810. From 1810 to 1865, when the first Anglo-American settlers arrived, the Pinnacles region was a wilderness without human use or habitation.

By the 1880s the Pinnacles, then known as the Palisades, were visited by picnickers from the surrounding communities who would explore the caves and camp. The first account of the Pinnacles region appeared in print in 1881, describing the Balconies area. Between 1889 and 1891, newspaper articles shifted from describing excursions to the &quot;Palisades&quot; to calling them the &quot;Pinnacles&quot;. Interest in the area rose to the point that the &quot;Hollister Free Lance&quot; sent a reporter to the Pinnacles, followed two months later by a party of local officials. Investors came from San Francisco to consider placing a resort hotel there, but the speculation came to nothing. In 1894, a post office was established in Bear Valley. Schuyler Hain was the postmaster. Since at least one other Bear Valley was in California, the post office was named &quot;Cook&quot; after Hain&#x27;s wife&#x27;s maiden name. In 1924, the post office was renamed &quot;Pinnacles&quot;.

Hain was a homesteader who arrived in the Pinnacles area in 1891 from Michigan, following his parents and eight siblings to Bear Valley. His cousin, A. W. White, was a student at Stanford University, and White brought G. K. Gilbert, one of his professors, to see the Pinnacles in 1893. Gilbert was impressed by the scenery, and his comments inspired Hain to publicize the region. Hain led tours to Bear Valley and through the caves, advocating the preservation of the Pinnacles. Hain&#x27;s efforts resulted in a 1904 visit by Stanford president David Starr Jordan, who contacted Fresno Congressman James C. Needham. Jordan and Needham, in turn, influenced Gifford Pinchot to advocate the establishment of the Pinnacles Forest Reserve to President Theodore Roosevelt, who proclaimed the establishment on July 18, 1906. Pinchot, who was primarily interested in the management of forests for productive use rather than for preservation, advocated the use of the recently passed Antiquities Act to designate the scenic core of the area as Pinnacles National Monument, which was done by Roosevelt on January 16, 1908. This designation nominally passed control of the Pinnacles from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, but the U.S. Forest Service retained effective control of the area until &quot;circa&quot; 1911.

In his efforts to promote the Pinnacles, Hain became convinced that the Pinnacles were an &quot;extraordinary mountain&quot; described by Captain George Vancouver and pictured by John Sykes in his book &quot;Voyage of Discovery&quot;, which documented the Vancouver Expedition. Hain began to refer to the mountain as &quot;Vancouver&#x27;s Pinnacles&quot;, a term that was picked up by &quot;Sunset&quot; in a 1903 article. References to &quot;Vancouver&#x27;s Pinnacles&quot; persisted until 1955, when analysis of the Sykes picture indicated that the mountain described by Vancouver was actually located near Fort Ord, within easy reach of the day trip described by Vancouver.

===National monument===
First set aside as part of the Pinnacles Forest Reserve in 1906, Pinnacles has had several different federal management agencies, ranging from the U.S. Forest Service to the United States General Land Office and ultimately to the National Park Service. In 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt created Pinnacles National Monument with the power given him in the Antiquities Act of 1906. The initial area designated under the Antiquities Act was . The Forest Service relinquished control of the monument &quot;circa&quot; 1911, but no operating agency yet existed to receive it. No drivable roads existed into the park from communities like Hollister. Hollister boosters campaigned for federal funds for road-building. Congressman Everis A. Hayes made a trip into the Pinnacles in 1913 as part of the campaign for road funds. By 1914, primitive roads extended to Bear Valley.

The National Park Service was finally established in 1916, but Pinnacles was not considered significant enough to command any Park Service resources at that time. In the meantime, a mining claim disrupted access to the traditional picnic grounds. In 1922, following repeated pleas from local residents for Park Service action, W.B. Lewis, superintendent of Yosemite National Park, was directed to visit Pinnacles and report on the circumstances to Park Service director Stephen Mather. Lewis had a difficult trip and stayed only 45 minutes, and his report included a recommendation that the monument be abandoned, since the most scenic sections were in private hands. The General Land Office, which administered lands surrounding the national monument and what was then known as Monterey National Forest, also received complaints, and in December 1922, J.H. Favorite of the GLO made a thorough report which was copied to Mather. Favorite recommended that public-domain lands be consolidated into the monument, and that a caretaker be appointed from a local homestead. In 1923, Herman Hermansen was appointed caretaker, and on May 7, 1923, the monument was enlarged by proclamation of President Warren G. Harding.

Mather finally visited the monument on March 28, 1924. A further proclamation, this time by Calvin Coolidge, enlarged the monument on July 2, 1924, securing water sources and campsites, was followed by a directive for a complete survey of the now- monument. Following a visit by NPS assistant director Horace M. Albright, money was appropriated to build a ranger&#x27;s cabin, completed in 1929, while facilities within the caves were improved. Frank A. Kittredge, the Park Service chief of engineering, and Thomas Chalmers Vint, Park Service landscape architect, conducted a survey for a five-year improvement plan in 1927. In 1929, condemnation proceedings were filed against private landowners in and around the park, including the mining company, seeking . An expansion proclamation by President Herbert Hoover in 1931 added of land donated by San Benito County. Trail building was expanded in the early 1930s, including a tunnel for the High Peaks Trail.
In 1933, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established for about 200 men who worked on additions to the trail network. After lengthy legal proceedings, the old mining claims were incorporated into the monument in 1958. CCC laborers improved the road in Bear Gulch, built tourist cabins, and constructed the dam at the Bear Gulch reservoir. A fire lookout was built by the CCC on Chalone Peak in 1935, but was destroyed by fire in 1951 and replaced by a frame structure the following year. The park&#x27;s visitor center and headquarters were built in 1936–37 from local stone. A superintendent&#x27;s residence was started in 1941 and completed in 1949. The Mission 66 project added lands and new projects, with an emphasis on development of the previously undeveloped west side of the park.

In 1975, the park comprised , growing to the present through a series of additions including the Pinnacles Ranch. The most recent addition to the Pinnacles National Monument was president Bill Clinton&#x27;s Proclamation 7266 that increased the size of the monument by and to include more caves.

===National park status===
Legislation authored by Rep. Sam Farr (D-California) to make Pinnacles National Monument a national park passed the United States Senate on December 30, 2012, having passed the House on July 31, 2012. The bill also designates the present Pinnacles Wilderness as the Hain Wilderness in commemoration of Schuyler Hain&#x27;s efforts to establish the national monument. The legislation was signed by President Barack Obama on January 10, 2013. The change in designation did not change the park&#x27;s status, management, or purpose. The U.S. Congress specified in the 1970 General Authorities Act and the 1978 Redwood Act that all units of the National Park System are to be treated on equal status, regardless of title. Pinnacles is the ninth unit in the National Park System in California to be named a national park.
==Geography==

Pinnacles National Park lies about inland from the Pacific Ocean and about south of the San Francisco Bay Area. The park is in the southern portion of the Gabilan Range, part of California&#x27;s Coast Ranges.

Elevation within the boundaries range from at the peak of North Chalone Peak.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Pinnacles National Park has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at the Painted Desert Visitor Center (1056 ft / 322 m) is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 19.3 °F (-7.1 °C).

The Santa Lucia Mountains lie between the park and Pacific Ocean, blocking the ocean’s moderating influence on diurnal temperature swings. In comparison to the nearby coast, temperatures have a much larger daily range of depending on season. The typical rainfall is about per year. Snow can fall in small amounts at higher elevations between mid-December and January.

The National Weather Service has a cooperative weather station at the park headquarters. January temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . July temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . The record high temperature of was reached three times, most recently on September 7, 2020. The record low temperature was on January 2, 1960 and December 22 and 24, 1990. Average annual precipitation is . The wettest calendar year was 1983 with and the driest 2013 with . The most precipitation in one month was in February 1998. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on February 3, 1998. The most snowfall in one month was in January 1962.

==Geology==

The park is located near the San Andreas Fault, which had a hand in giving rise to the unique formations the park protects. The Pinnacles are part of the Neenach Volcano which erupted 23 million years ago near present-day Lancaster. The movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault split a section of rock off from the main body of the volcano and moved it to the northwest. It is believed that the pinnacles came from this particular volcano because of the unique breccias that are only found elsewhere in the Neenach Volcano formations. Differential erosion and weathering of the exposed rock formed the Pinnacles that are seen today. The rock formations are andesite and rhyolite, forming a dropped fault block embedded in the Gabilan Range.

Large-scale earth movement also formed the talus caves that can be found in the park. Deep, narrow gorges and shear fractures were transformed into caves by large chunks of rock falling from above and wedging into the cracks, leaving an open area below.

Since the Pinnacles were moved to this area, the San Andreas Fault has shifted to the east of the park. The original location of the San Andreas can be seen in the Chalone Creek fault. Two other large faults are known to run through the park, the Miner&#x27;s Gulch and Pinnacles faults. These faults parallel the San Andreas and were most likely caused by major movements of the main fault. The establishment of the relative movement between the Pinnacles and the Neenach rocks was a significant factor in the acceptance of plate tectonics in geology.

Seismic activity is frequent in the park, and United States Geological Survey maintains two seismometers within the boundaries. Evidence of past and ongoing seismic activity can be seen in offset streams where they cross faults. Valley bottoms and terraces show signs of uplift.

==Ecology==

===Wildlife===

Native animals, now locally extinct from most of central California, included tule elk and pronghorn. Grizzly and black bears were in the area until the end of the 19th century. Mammals and birds that inhabit this park include prairie falcon, coyote, skunk, great horned owl, bobcat, California quail, raccoon, wild turkey, gray fox, golden eagle, and cougar.

Prairie falcons breed in this area in some of the highest densities of anywhere in North America. Peregrine falcons have recently returned to the park to breed, also, but in far fewer numbers. A California condor re-establishment program has been in place since 2003. The first nest since reintroduction was built in 2010, and Pinnacles now manages a population of 25 free-flying condor.

Thirteen species of bats have been documented at Pinnacles, with a further three species considered likely. The talus caves provide roosting and breeding habitat for the bats.

In the 1990s, a student biologist, Olivia Messinger, did a census of bees at Pinnacles. She found that the park has more bees per unit area than known anywhere else on earth, around 450 species. Most of these bees are solitary bees, not living in colonies like European honeybees, and most live for only three to four weeks, and since flowers bloom here throughout the growing season, many niches are available for all the bee species.

Like many parks in central California, Pinnacles has had a problem with wild pigs (a mix of feral domestic pigs and imported wild boars) disturbing the landscape on a regular basis. As of spring 2006, the core of the park was pig-free. The culmination of a twenty-year, $1.6 million effort had succeeded in eradicating pigs from the main area of the park. National Park Service personnel along with IWS worked to remove pigs from inside the park, and establish and monitor an exclusionary fence that runs for approximately around the center core of the park. Outside this fence, wild pigs still roam. Monitoring for potential breaks and breaches in the fence is performed to ensure that the pigs do not return to the park.

===Vegetation===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Pinnacles National Park has a Chaparral (&quot;33&quot;) potential vegetation type with a California chaparral and woodlands (&quot;6&quot;) vegetation form. The vegetation is about 80% chaparral with woodlands, riparian, and grasslands merged into the chaparral.

In the warmer portions of the park, large areas of greasewood cover slopes, along with manzanita, gray pine, canyon live oak, and blue oak. Cooler portions of the park have higher proportions of pines and oaks, together with California buckeye, hollyleaf cherry, and coffeeberry. Willows and elderberries are found along the intermittent streams. Fire has been a dominant influence on the region&#x27;s flora, both from natural causes and from intentional intervention by people. When the region was inhabited by Native Americans, they used fire as a tool to encourage the growth of preferred food sources, and to herd small game during hunting. Since the disappearance of native peoples, the hills have become brushier.

==Hain Wilderness==
More than 80% () of the park is designated as the Hain Wilderness (known until 2013 as the Pinnacles Wilderness). Wilderness designation provides even higher protection for the rock spires that give Pinnacles its name, as well as South Chalone Peak, the second-highest peak in the park. The wilderness includes the creeks and canyons that are habitat for the endangered California red-legged frog. The United States Congress in 1976 enacted Public Law 94-567, adding Pinnacles Wilderness and several others to the National Wilderness Preservation System.

==Activities==

Although roads approach the park from the west through Soledad and from the east through empty lands south of Hollister, the roads do not connect in the park. Most of the developed areas are on the east side of the park. Portions of the park&#x27;s road network are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Several trails have been developed for day hikers, some of which are strenuous. Primarily in March and April, a wide variety of wildflowers is on display, except in years of extreme drought. The trails provide views of the surrounding hills and valleys on clear days. The San Andreas Fault is visible from some vantages along the trails. The park includes a well-known hiking portion known among enthusiasts simply as &quot;The Pig Fence&quot;. This portion of South Wilderness Trail is a challenging stretch of strenuous hiking that at times requires use of the fence, erected to prevent feral pigs from entering the park, to help oneself to climb the steeply pitched trail. Other trails include lush wildflower-accented views along flat stream beds, trails that bring one into beautiful caves, and trails that involve high vistas of the Pinnacle formations.

The caves at Pinnacles are talus caves, formed when steep, narrow canyons were filled with boulders, leaving passages between the larger rocks. Bear Gulch Cave on the east side of the park and Balconies Cave on the west side are seasonally open to visitors. Trails lead to and through both caves. These caves house breeding colonies for Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat and are closed during pupping season. The caves may be flooded at times of high water. The National Park Service maintains a webpage showing the status of the caves.

Camping facilities are available on the east side in the Pinnacles Campground.

The park is popular with advanced rock climbers because of the many difficult and challenging climbs. The park is home to a variety of bouldering, single-pitch, and multi-pitch routes. Rock quality, volcanic breccia, can break while climbing.

<text>County Wexford () is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Leinster and is part of the Southern Region. Named after the town of Wexford, it was based on the historic Gaelic territory of Hy Kinsella (&quot;Uí Ceinnsealaigh&quot;), whose capital was Ferns. Wexford County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 163,527 at the 2022 census.

==History==


The county is rich in evidence of early human habitation. &quot;Portal tombs&quot; (sometimes called dolmens) exist at Ballybrittas (on Bree Hill) and at Newbawn – and date from the Neolithic period or earlier. Remains from the Bronze Age period are far more widespread. Early Irish tribes formed the Kingdom of Uí Cheinnsealaig, an area that was slightly larger than the current County Wexford.

County Wexford was one of the earliest areas of Ireland to be Christianised, in the early 5th century. Later, from 819 onwards, the Vikings invaded and plundered many Christian sites in the county. Vikings settled at Wexford town near the end of the 9th century.

In 1169, Wexford was the site of the invasion of Ireland by Normans at the behest of Diarmuid Mac Murrough, King of Uí Cheinnsealaig and king of Leinster (Laigin). This was followed by the subsequent colonisation of the country by the Cambro-Normans.

The native Irish began to regain some of their former territories in the 14th century, especially in the north of the county, principally under Art MacMurrough Kavanagh. Under Henry VIII, the great religious houses were dissolved, 1536–41; in County Wexford this included Glascarrig Priory, Clonmines Priory, Tintern Abbey, and Dunbrody Abbey.

On 23 October 1641, a major rebellion broke out in Ireland, and County Wexford produced strong support for Confederate Ireland. Oliver Cromwell and his English Parliamentarian Army arrived in 1649 in the county and captured it. The lands of the Irish and Anglo-Normans were confiscated and given to Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers as payment for their service in the Parliamentarian Army. At Duncannon, in the south-west of the county, James II, after his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, embarked for Kinsale and then to exile in France.

County Wexford was the most important area in which the Irish Rebellion of 1798 was fought, during which significant battles occurred at The Battle of Oulart Hill during the 1798 rebellion. Vinegar Hill (Enniscorthy) and New Ross. The famous ballad &quot;Boolavogue&quot; was written in remembrance of the Wexford Rising. At Easter 1916, a small rebellion occurred at Enniscorthy town, on cue with that in Dublin. During World War II, German planes bombed Campile. In 1963 John F. Kennedy, then President of the United States, visited the county and his ancestral home at Dunganstown, near New Ross.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Wexford is the 13th-largest of Ireland&#x27;s thirty-two traditional counties in area, and 9th-largest in terms of population. It is the largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties in size, and fourth-largest in terms of population. The county is located in the south-east corner of the island of Ireland. It is bounded by the sea on two sides—on the south by the Atlantic Ocean and on the east by St. George&#x27;s Channel and the Irish Sea. The River Barrow forms its western boundary. The Blackstairs Mountains form part of the boundary to the north, as do the southern edges of the Wicklow Mountains. The adjoining counties are Waterford to the south-west, Kilkenny to the west, Carlow to the north-west and Wicklow in the north.

===Mountains and hills===

Largely low-lying fertile land is the characteristic landscape of the county. The highest point in the county is Mount Leinster at , in the Blackstairs Mountains in the north-west on the boundary with County Carlow.

Other high points:
* Black Rock Mountain, , located near the Wexford-Carlow border, within County Wexford.
* Croghan Mountain (or &quot;Croghan Kinsella&quot;) on the Wexford-Wicklow border – 
*Annagh Hill, , near the Wicklow border
* Slieveboy, 

Notable hills include: Carrigbyrne Hill; Camross (or Camaross) Hill, ; Carrigmaistia, ; Bree Hill, ; Gibbet Hill; Vinegar Hill; Slievecoiltia; Forth Mountain, ; and Tara Hill.

===Rivers and lakes===
The major rivers are the Slaney and the Barrow. At in length, the river Barrow is the second-longest river on the island of Ireland. Smaller rivers of note are the Owenduff, Pollmounty, Corrock, Urrin, Boro, Owenavorragh (also spelt Ounavarra), Sow and Bann rivers.

There are no significant fresh-water lakes in the county. Small seaside lakes or lagoons exist at two locations – one is called Lady&#x27;s Island Lake and the other Tacumshin Lake.

The &quot;Wexford Cot&quot; is a flat-bottomed boat used for fishing on the tidal mudflats in Wexford. A canoe-shaped punt fitted with a gun, called a &quot;float&quot; in Wexford, is used traditionally to shoot game birds in the North Slob mud flats.

===Islands===
The Saltee Islands lie offshore from Kilmore Quay, while the smaller Keeragh Islands are offshore from Bannow.

===Climate===

County Wexford, sometimes dubbed Ireland&#x27;s &quot;sunny southeast&quot;, has in general a higher number of hours of sunshine recorded daily than in the rest of the country.
This has resulted in Wexford becoming one of the most popular places in Ireland in which to reside. The county has a mild, but changeable, oceanic climate with few extremes. The North Atlantic Drift, a continuation of the Gulf Stream, moderates winter temperatures. There is a meteorological station located at Rosslare Harbour. January and February are generally the coldest months, with temperatures ranging from on average. July and August are generally the warmest months, with average temperatures ranging from in coastal areas and in inland areas. The prevailing winds blow from the south-west. Precipitation falls throughout the year. Mean annual rainfall is . Generally, the county receives less snow than more northerly parts of Ireland. Heavy snowfalls are relatively rare, but can occur. The one exception is Mount Leinster, visible from a large portion of the county, and frequently covered with snow during the winter months. Frost is frequent in winter months, less so in coastal areas.

===Soil===
An ice sheet covered most, but not all, of the county during the last Ice age. As the ice retreated, County Wexford would have been one of the first areas to be covered with glacial drift (a mixture of boulders, clay, sand and gravel) that blanketed the existing bedrock. This has led to high-quality soils, suitable for a wide range of agriculture. A very detailed soil survey of the county was published in 1964 as part of the &#x27;National Soil Survey of Ireland&#x27;. It classifies each area of the county according to its specific soil type.

Most of the county is covered with soils called &quot;brown earths&quot;, described as well-drained and having a wide use-range. After that, &quot;gleys&quot; (poorly to imperfectly drained with a limited use-range) are the next major soil type, primarily located in the south-east of the county and east of Gorey (along the coast). Gleys are dotted elsewhere around the county in small areas, and where they occur they generally form bogland. The last major soil type, &quot;brown podzolics&quot;, occur mainly near the edges of the Blackstairs Mountain range and around Bunclody and in the baronies of East Shelmalier and South Ballaghkeen. Though there are areas covered with other soil types, these are of limited extent.

===Flora===
Common species of tree include oak, ash, sycamore, alder, blackthorn, hawthorn, beech and birch. Less common (but plentiful) species include wild cherry and Scots pine (also called red deal). Elm is now far less common, due to the devastating effects of Dutch elm disease. Gorse (or furze) is very common. A priority habitat in Wexford is the grey dune, on which many native wild flora grow, including bee orchid and pyramidal orchid. Despite the designation of much of this habitat as a Special Area of Conservation, it remains threatened by destruction for agricultural intensification. There is very little natural forest in the county. Most natural trees and vegetation grow on hedgerows.

===Fauna===
South-eastern Wexford is an important site for wild birds—the north side of Wexford Harbour, the North Slob, is home to 10,000 Greenland white-fronted geese each winter (roughly one third of the entire world&#x27;s population), while in the summer Lady&#x27;s Island Lake is an important breeding site for terns, especially the roseate tern. The grey heron is also seen.

Throughout the county pheasant, woodpigeon and feral pigeons are widespread. Mute swan, mallard, kingfisher, and owls (the long-eared owl, the short-eared owl, and the barn owl) are less common – but plentiful. Red grouse, once common, is now extremely scarce. The species has been in decline for some decades. Threats include habitat degradation, disease, predation and over-hunting. Red grouse in Ireland are now considered threatened. The corncrake, also once very common, is now almost never seen. Smaller birds—such as crows, swallows, robins, wrens and so on—are very common. The first magpies in Ireland were recorded by Robert Leigh, of Rosegarland, County Wexford, as having appeared in the County of Wexford about 1676.
Land mammals include badger, rabbit, otter, hedgehog, red fox, mink, bats, squirrels (red and grey), rats (brown and black – both introduced species), and mice (wood (or field) and house). Two types of hare—the Irish (or mountain) hare and the less common brown (or European) hare—are found. Hare is not nearly as common as rabbit. The stoat (&quot;Mustela erminea hibernica&quot;) is also reasonably common. Locally the stoat is just as often incorrectly called a weasel.

Only two types of seal are found on County Wexford&#x27;s coast—Atlantic grey seals are very plentiful in coastal areas; the slightly smaller common (or harbour) seal is less common, yet plentiful. The &quot;small tortoiseshell butterfly&quot; (reddish-orange colour, with black markings) is the most common species of butterfly in the county. Various types of moth are also common. The common frog – the only type of frog found – is plentiful.

==Culture==

Since 1951, an opera festival, Wexford Festival Opera, takes place every year in the Theatre Royal in Wexford town and runs for several weeks. In 2008, a new Opera House replaced the old one on the same site, once called the Wexford Opera House, but in 2014 being designated as Ireland&#x27;s National Opera House. It consists of two theatres, the O&#x27;Reilly Theatre and the Jerome Hynes Theatre.

There is a renowned singing tradition in County Wexford. Having an abundance of traditional songs, many of which relate to the rebellion of 1798, the county has for many years had a strong presence in the Irish traditional singing scene. Noted singers include All-Ireland Fleadh Champions Paddy Berry, Seamus Brogan and Niall Wall. Paddy Berry has also collected and published a number of songs from Wexford.

Beaches in Curracloe, County Wexford were used to film the opening scenes of the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, which depicted the D-day assault on Omaha Beach. &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, directed by Kevin Reynolds, was partly filmed in the village of Duncannon in 2000 – Duncannon Fort being used for one of the main scenes. The movie &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was partially set and filmed in Enniscorthy and featured some of the locals as extras.

==Media==
Two radio stations are based in the county: South East Radio and Beat 102-103.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The economy is chiefly agricultural. Cattle, sheep, pig rearing and some horse breeding are the main types of husbandry practised. Poultry rearing, once popular, has very much declined. Wheat, barley, rapeseed, and oats are grown, as are potatoes. Sugar beet is no longer grown due to the withdrawal of EU subsidies. The numbers involved in farming have been declining for many years and many of the seasonal workers are now eastern Europeans. Mushrooms are also grown indoors. Tomatoes are grown under glass, for example at Campile.

Wexford strawberries are famous and can be bought in shops and wayside stalls throughout the summer. Every year, near the end of June, a &#x27;Strawberry Fair&#x27; Festival takes place in the town of Enniscorthy, and a &quot;Strawberry Queen&quot; is crowned. Dairy farming forms an important part of the agricultural industry. Locally produced milk is on sale in many supermarkets. Wexford Irish Cheddar is a brand, and Carrigbyrne, a full-flavoured soft cheese, is produced near New Ross.

===Forestry===
Evergreen tree species are extensively cultivated, especially in more recent years—Norway spruce and Sitka spruce are the most common varieties planted. These are generally sown on poorer quality soils (mainly in bogs and on hills or mountainsides). A small amount of deciduous trees are also planted, though these require better soils.

===Mining===
Silver was once mined at Clonmines—primarily in Tudor times. Lead was mined at Caim, 1818 – c. 1850—this mine also contains zinc; the two are usually found together. Copper ore (malachite) is found at Kerloge, just south of the town of Wexford. Iron is found in small quantities at Courtown Harbour. The county is not noted for mineral reserves. No significant mining activity is currently practised, with the exception of quarrying for stone. In 2007, a significant oil find was made off Hook Head in County Wexford.

===Energy===

Carnsore Point made the national headlines in the late 1970s after a proposal was made to build a nuclear energy plant there; the plans were abandoned after extensive protests from the public, due to environmental and health concerns. 
Great Island Power Station opened in 1967 and was operated by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) until it was sold to Endesa in January 2009. It is an electricity-generating station fueled by heavy fuel oil and rated at 240 MW. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Barrow and Suir, near Campile. Before its sale, the station was scheduled to close by 2010. Endesa propose building a 430 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) gas fired plant on the site. The project would need a new gas pipeline from the existing transmission network at Baunlusk, south of Kilkenny City. A wind farm has now been built on the site, featuring 14 wind turbines generating electricity. It was completed in November 2002 and was the first wind farm on the east coast of Ireland. Wind farms now exist at a few other locations in the county, such as Ballywater Wind Farm, at Cahore (near Kilmuckridge), on the county&#x27;s east coast, and Richfield wind farm, located in the southeast of the county.

==Transport==
* Bus: Wexford and Dublin are linked by Bus Éireann route 2 and Wexford Bus routes 740 and 740A. While route 5 operates Waterford-New Ross-Enniscorthy-Dublin. There are numerous local bus routes radiating from Wexford town to places such as Kilmore Quay, Lady&#x27;s Island, Kilmuckridge.
* Rail: The Rosslare–Dublin railway line runs through the county, serving Rosslare Europort, Rosslare Strand, Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey. Four trains run in each direction daily (three at weekends), with additional commuter services from Gorey. The Rosslare–Limerick railway line which traverses the southern part of the county is now mothballed but being maintained (it served stations at Bridgetown, Wellington Bridge, Ballycullane and Campile).
* Ferry: Rosslare Europort, located at Rosslare Harbour, operates a busy ferry service. There are regular sailings to Wales (Pembroke and Fishguard) and France (Cherbourg and in the summer months to Roscoff) for passengers and vehicles. There is also ferry service in operation between Ballyhack and Passage East (County Waterford), crossing the Barrow estuary.

<text>Tuolumne Meadows () is a gentle, dome-studded, sub-alpine meadow area along the Tuolumne River in the eastern section of Yosemite National Park in the United States. Its approximate location is . Its approximate elevation is . The term &quot;Tuolumne Meadows&quot; is also often used to describe a large portion of the Yosemite high country around the meadows, especially in context of rock climbing.

==Natural history==
The meadow vegetation is supported by shallow groundwater. The water comes from 1,000 mm (39 inches) of precipitation annually, predominantly in the form of snow. Water arises from snowmelt and hill-slope aquifers, and flows through the Tuolumne River, Budd Creek, Delaney Creek, and Unicorn Creek. In spring, as soon as the snow melts, it is not uncommon to see large areas of the meadows flooded and practically transformed into lakes.

While the mountains of the Sierra Nevada near the meadows have had some permanent snowfields, in the summer they are mostly free of snow. Although brief, the late spring and summer wildflower bloom in Tuolumne Meadows is host to a wide variety of California wildflowers, including the relatively rare Purple Webber, a type of lupin.

Plant species composition changes across the meadows with different landforms, landscape positions, and summer water-table depths. Areas with seasonal flooding and deep-standing water support the inflated sedge and Sierra willow. The main herbaceous wet meadow species include alpine aster, nearly-black sedge, King&#x27;s ricegrass, western bistort, Breweri&#x27;s reed grass, and dwarf bilberry. Thread-leaved sedge, pussy-toes, Sierra lodgepole pine, and Ross sedge are found in drier uplands within or on the edge of the meadows.

==Climate==
==Recreation==

Tuolumne Meadows has a good view of the Cathedral Range and Unicorn Peak (to the south), Lembert Dome, and Mount Dana (to the east). Camping is available at the Tuolumne Meadows campground (reservations recommended). Excellent hiking and rock climbing are accessible from Tuolumne Meadows, which tends to be less crowded than Yosemite Valley. Downstream (flowing to the right (western) side of the image), the Tuolumne River cascades over Waterwheel Falls near Glen Aulin, eventually pooling at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.

The road to the meadows is generally free of snow from June through October. Due to the extreme elevation, road access over Tioga Pass along Highway 120 is closed through winter season.

=== Hiking ===
Many backcountry hiking and backpacking trails start in Tuolumne Meadows including the primary route to summit Mount Lyell, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park. The John Muir and the Pacific Crest Trails are long-distance backpacking trails and follow a route through Lyell Canyon into Tuolumne Meadows. A large number of backpackers hike these trails each year. Along with these longer trails, Tuolumne Meadows feature a wide range of day trails to locations including Gaylor Lakes, Cathedral Lakes, Mono Pass, and Lembert Dome. The day hike trails are popular, and become busy during the summer high seasons. These trails are serviced by the Tuolumne Meadows shuttle bus, typically from June to September, though the dates are subject to change due to weather.
===Rock climbing===
In contrast to the big walls of Yosemite Valley, climbing at Tuolumne generally consists of short- to medium-length routes on eleven major domes and a number of minor ones, stretching from the Stately Pleasure Dome above Tenaya Lake to Lembert Dome on the east side of the Meadows. Since the area is all at a high elevation, the climbing season is mainly limited to June through September.

The rock is porphyritic granite, a very strong form of granite. It has a tendency for exfoliation, which helps produce and preserve the distinctive dome shapes. The resulting climbing includes both face and crack routes, the former often runout due to limited numbers of bolts, and the latter frequently following very thin cracks. The local ethic is to limit the placement of bolts on new routes and to forbid the addition of bolts to existing routes, resulting in distances of 40 feet (12 m) or more between bolts.
The major domes include:
* Stately Pleasure Dome
* Polly Dome
* Daff Dome
* Pothole Dome
* Lembert Dome
* Fairview Dome

See Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park for a list of granite domes in Yosemite National park, not just around Tuolumne.

In addition, the peaks of the nearby Cathedral Range, such as Cathedral Peak, Pywiack Dome, and Medlicott Dome, are traditionally considered part of the climbing area.

==Infrastructure==
The Tuolumne Meadows area is served by the Tioga Pass Road (California SR 120), which had been paved by the 1920s. Its present route through the meadows was laid out in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. A housing area for seasonal employees was relocated at that time, whose new site includes a surviving collection of fine National Park Service rustic CCC-built structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places as &quot;Tuolumne Meadows&quot; in 1978.

<doc id="215269" wikidata="Q7675648" url="?curid=215269" title="Tahquitz Peak">
<text>Tahquitz Peak (pronounced , sometimes ) is a granite, rock formation located on the high western slope of the San Jacinto mountain range in Riverside County, Southern California, United States, above the mountain town of Idyllwild. Tahquitz has a steep approach hike (approximately 800-foot elevation gain in a half mile), leading to a roughly 1000-foot face. Tahquitz, which can refer to both the rock outcrop and the outcrop&#x27;s parent peak, is a popular hiking destination to the fire lookout station and the rock climbing area.

The Yosemite Decimal System, widely used in North America to classify hiking and climbing routes, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz Peak.

==Description==
Tahquitz Peak can be reached from one of several trails, and is only a half-mile deviation from the Pacific Crest Trail. The most direct route is the South Ridge trail starting in Idyllwild, California. This trail is a direct hike to the peak and is typically used as an &quot;out and back&quot; route, four miles in length, featuring a 2400 ft. elevation gain. Tahquitz Peak can also be achieved via Devil&#x27;s Slide Trail in Idyllwild, 4.8 miles one way, with a 2350 ft. elevation gain. The peak can be reached from the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway via a ten-mile hike with rolling hills and various ascents and descents.

Tahquitz Peak is used as a fire lookout in the late spring to mid fall, using a two-man ranger station with 270-degree panoramic views.

==History==
The area was named after the legendary luminous spirit-demon of the Soboba Indian tribe. The name first appeared in print on a 1901 USGS San Jacinto topographical map.

Two nearby rock climbing locations are Tahquitz Rock and Suicide Rock.

Tahquitz Rock (also known as Lily Rock) is to the northwest of the summit of Tahquitz Peak. It is said to have a lily-white appearance, which might account for the “Lily” name. Another theory is that it was named for Lily Eastman who was the daughter of Dr. Sanford Eastman, the first Secretary and a Director of the &quot;Southern California Colony Association&quot; which later became the city of Riverside.

Suicide Rock is to the northwest. Over three hundred climbing routes have been described there.

In 2018, the Cranston Fire burned up the south face of Tahquitz Peak and threatened the fire lookout.

==Climbing history==
In the 1930s, the Rock Climbing Section (RCS) of the Sierra Club in California started a campaign to identify potential rock climbing locations in southern California. RCS member Jim Smith &quot;discovered&quot; Tahquitz in June 1935. The first fifth-class ascent of Tahquitz, &quot;The Trough&quot; (), occurred in August 1936 by Jim Smith, Bob Brinton, and Zene Jasaitis. A month later, Smith and Bill Rice quickly put up the now-classic route, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Fright&quot; (5.6). In 1937, Dick Jones and Glen Dawson led a first ascent of &quot;The Mechanic&#x27;s Route&quot;, one of the first 5.8s in the country. During the late 1930s, the movie &quot;Three on a Rope&quot; featured climbing at Tahquitz.

By 1940, about a dozen routes had been established. World War II slowed down development, but activity soon picked back up and fresh faces were seen at Tahquitz. Royal Robbins, a prominent member of the RCS, led the new surge in Tahquitz development in the 1950s. This new group of climbers eschewed some of the time-honored safety techniques of the past, which led to harder and harder climbs being developed, culminating with &quot;The Vampire&quot; in 1959. Though Robbins and Dave Rearick climbed it via aid technique (5.9 A3/4), it was free climbed in 1973 (5.11a) by John Long et al. and is now considered one of the best free climbs in southern California.

With the help of new climbing shoe designs, route development in the 1960s jumped well into 5.10 territory. Nearby Suicide Rock also started to be developed, resulting in another southern California classic, &quot;Valhalla&quot; (5.11a) in November 1970.

The Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) of classifying routes was developed at Tahquitz by members of the RCS of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club in the 1950s. Royal Robbins in 1952 established what was then one of the hardest free climbs in the United States, known as &quot;Open Book&quot;. As new routes were constantly being discovered and climbed, the old method of rating climbs as either easy, moderate, or hard was quickly becoming useless. With the help of fellow RCS members Don Wilson and Chuck Wilts, the modern system of rating fifth-class climbing was developed, with the scale running from 5.0 to 5.9. Mark Powell, a local who frequented Yosemite, passed this system on to the climbers in Yosemite. By the early 1960s, the Yosemite Decimal System was the standard in the United States.

In 1967, Bob Kamps and Mark Powell established &quot;Chingadera&quot; one of the first 5.11 in the country and setting a new standard in rock climbing.

Most climbers, after the 1970s, considered the area &quot;climbed out&quot; in terms of potential new first ascents. Still, new and quality climbs continued to be added on Tahquitz as well as the smaller rock outcrops nearby, Bob Gaines having established many of them.

The Idyllwild Area Historical Society museum contains a wealth of information about the early climbing history of Tahquitz and Suicide Rock.

==Natural history==
The plant &quot;Ivesia callida&quot; is endemic to the San Jacinto Range and is known by the common name Tahquitz mousetail.

<doc id="215270" wikidata="Q1083155" url="?curid=215270" title="Betty (Helmet album)">
<text>Betty is the third studio album by American alternative metal band Helmet, released in 1994 by Interscope Records. It is Helmet&#x27;s highest charting album in the US.

The album was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band&#x27;s success with the previous album, &quot;Meantime&quot; (1992). Rob Echeverria (guitarist of New York hardcore band Rest in Pieces) replaced Peter Mengede on guitar. After recording and touring in support of the album, Echeverria left Helmet in 1995 to join Biohazard; however, his departure was more amicable than Mengede&#x27;s.

Prior to &quot;Betty&quot;″s release in June 1994, the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Milquetoast&quot;, appeared in alternate form on &quot;The Crow soundtrack&quot; as &quot;Milktoast&quot;. Its video was in regular rotation on MTV, and videos for &quot;Wilma&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Biscuits for Smut&quot; were also released. In 2015, the band announced a &quot;Betty&quot; tour, where they performed the album in its entirety.

==Musical style==
Usually regarded as Helmet&#x27;s experimental album, it features a broader approach with forays into jazz and blues. Frontman Page Hamilton said, &quot;those things were my indulgences. I tried to force the music in different directions. I know a lot of fans were disappointed, but I think it&#x27;s important to try to grow musically.&quot; Helmet&#x27;s sonic trademarks of crunching riffs and pounding drums still define the album. &quot;Betty&quot;, along with &quot;Meantime&quot; and &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, are considered definitive influences in post-metal.

==Recording and production==
Helmet entered the studio in the fall of 1993 with producer T-Ray to record the follow-up to its 1992 record &quot;Meantime.&quot; Writing and recording sessions took place at Soundtrack, Power Station, and Sound on Sound in New York City. Rhythm guitarist Rob Echeverria claimed in 2015 that Interscope&#x27;s expectations for the album were high, stating &quot;when I joined the band [in 1993], it was right at the end of the &quot;Meantime&quot; tour, so everything was really riding high. We all got the gold records, the band was really happy about that and it was all good.&quot; He also recalls, &quot;I remember going home and sitting for months while Page wrote the record and then us getting together in the fall to rehearse.&quot;

==Touring==
At shows in 1993, Helmet performed early versions of &quot;Betty&quot;-era songs such as &quot;I Know&quot;, &quot;Thick&quot;, and &quot;Vaccination&quot;. In support of &quot;Betty&quot;, Helmet went on a 24-date American tour with Rollins Band and the Les Claypool project Sausage. According to Hamilton in 2002, the entire tour with Rollins Band and Sausage was recorded. Other artists that Helmet performed with during the &quot;Betty&quot; cycle include Beastie Boys, Girls Against Boys, Kepone, Orange 9mm, Primus, Kerbdog, Understand, Quicksand, Today Is the Day and German noise trio Caspar Brötzmann Massaker. At a Connecticut concert with Girls Against Boys and Caspar Brötzmann Massaker, the latter group received a negative reception from Helmet&#x27;s audience for opening the show with three 10-minute noisescapes. According to a 1994 article by the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, the audience&#x27;s reaction angered Hamilton, who explained, &quot;we tour with groups we like. Try to open your ears and open your minds.&quot;

Shortly after the release of &quot;Betty&quot;, Interscope&#x27;s promotional support for Helmet waned, and the band began playing to lower crowds, with Echeverria remembering, &quot;when we&#x27;d show up to play on tour, especially in Europe, there was nobody there. So we went from this big high to big lows.&quot; The touring cycle for &quot;Betty&quot; ended in January 1995, although later in 1995 the band ended up going on a small run of American shows opening for Nine Inch Nails.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Betty&quot; was released on June 21, 1994, and peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, making it Helmet&#x27;s highest ranking album so far. However, it failed to replicated the success of &quot;Meantime&quot;, and by 1997 the album had only sold 500,000 copies worldwide. In their original 1994 review, &quot;Spin&quot; commented that the album was &quot;yet more of the band’s relentless thump and grind. Guitarist Peter Mengede has been replaced by Rob Echeverria, but otherwise the Helmet machine chugs on without a glitch. This is heavy metal without the theater, head-banging music for people without hair.&quot; Lorraine Ali of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed in her June 1994 review that &quot;sludgy fuzz guitar now engulfs the precision thrashing of Helmet, a New York metal quartet that plays tight, sharp grooves with a maniacal and sometimes experimental urban edge.&quot; In his retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s John Franck gave it three out of five stars, writing &quot;label pressure notwithstanding, the album had a lot more riding on it than even perhaps Hamilton was willing to admit [...] &quot;Betty&quot; appears to be an almost too well thought out affair, and, ultimately, its songs miss out on some of the discreet melodic accents which had served to underpin even the most bludgeoning noise-fests on &quot;Meantime&quot;.&quot;

===Legacy===
Despite a lukewarm commercial reception initially, the album has since garnered praise from Helmet fans and critics alike. In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it on a list titled &quot;1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative’s Greatest Year&quot;, while in 2019 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; included it on their list of the &quot;10 essential alt-metal albums&quot;. &quot;Louder Sound&quot; state, &quot;their influence on nu-metal is massive yet never really talked about, which could be down to the fact that Helmet didn’t just create in massive concrete block riffs, they also dealt in arty, avant-garde passages of noise.&quot;

&quot;Diffuser.fm&quot; in 2015 called it the most accessible yet most challenging Helmet album. They reflect, &quot;right off the bat, with its pleasantly eerie cover of a filtered photo of a woman kneeling on a lawn in what appears to be &#x27;50s suburbia, the third album by New York City alt-metal quartet Helmet announced a departure from the spartan rigidity and single-mindedness the band made famous with their 1992 sophomore effort, &quot;Meantime&quot;&quot;, further adding that, &quot;when Helmet followed-up &quot;Betty&quot; with the decidedly more direct and stripped-down &quot;Aftertaste&quot; in 1997, Hamilton almost seemed to apologize for deigning to deviate from his usual formula. Apparently, time has afforded him with some perspective, as Helmet performed &quot;Betty&quot; in its entirety on tour in 2015. More than two decades later, the album still continues to reveal its charms.&quot;

In 2004, the songs &quot;Wilma&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;I Know&quot;, &quot;Milquetoast&quot;, &quot;Rollo&quot; and &quot;Overrated&quot; appeared on the compilation album &quot;&quot;. The track listing was chosen by Page Hamilton, and for unknown reasons omitted &quot;Biscuits for Smut&quot;, which was released as a single and had a music video. Instrumental versions of &quot;Wilma&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Milquetoast&quot;, &quot;Tic&quot; and &quot;Overrated&quot; also appeared on a promotional 2003 release titled &quot;The Instrumental Music of Helmet (1992–1997)&quot;. Covers of &quot;I Know&quot; by Fashion Week and &quot;Milquetoast&quot; by Brief Lives appeared as part of the 2016 Helmet tribute album &quot;Meantime (Redux)&quot;.

==Track listing==

=== Amphetamine Reptile track listing ===

The album was issued on vinyl (on Amphetamine Reptile Records) in two-disc 10-inch format; this version included additional tracks &quot;Flushings&quot;, &quot;Thick&quot;, and &quot;Pariah&quot; but omits &quot;Sam Hell&quot;.

A limited edition CD was released with a blue jewel case and five extra live tracks recorded July 30, 1994, in Los Angeles. The live tracks are &quot;Sinatra&quot;, &quot;FBLA II&quot;, &quot;Tic&quot;, &quot;Just Another Victim&quot;, and &quot;In the Meantime&quot;. (These tracks were released overseas on the &quot;Wilma&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; CD EP.)

In 2010, a 19-track digital only reissue of &quot;Betty&quot; was released. It included the bonus tracks &quot;Flushings&quot;, &quot;Thick&quot;, &quot;Pariah&quot;, &quot;Biscuits for Smut (Mutt Mix)&quot;, and &quot;Biscuits for Smut (Pooch Mix)&quot;.

In 2024, a 30-year anniversary edition of &quot;Betty&quot; was released, including the bonus tracks &quot;Flushings&quot;, &quot;Thick&quot;, &quot;Pariah&quot;, &quot;Biscuits for Smut (Mutt Mix)&quot;, and &quot;Biscuits for Smut (Pooch Mix)&quot; on a second LP. This edition featured new artwork based on the original, and included an insert of the original cover. As opposed to the original 10-inch Amphetamine Reptile release, &quot;Sam Hell&quot; is also included.

<doc id="215271" wikidata="Q3293507" url="?curid=215271" title="Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)">
<text>Publius Cornelius Scipio (died 211 BC) was a general and statesman of the Roman Republic and the father of Scipio Africanus.

A member of the Cornelia &quot;gens&quot;, Scipio served as consul in 218 BC, the first year of the Second Punic War. At the outbreak of the war, he was ordered to conduct the war effort in the Iberian Peninsula and confront Hannibal himself, while his fellow consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus was allocated Sicily and Africa. Scipio was given permission to recruit two Roman legions, 14,000 allied infantry, 1,600 allied cavalry and given 60 quinqueremes. He sailed with his army from Pisa with the intention of confronting Hannibal in Hispania. Stopping at Massalia (today Marseille) to replenish his supplies, he was shocked to discover that Hannibal&#x27;s army had moved from Hispania and was crossing the Rhône. Scipio disembarked his army and marched to confront Hannibal, who, by now, had moved on. Returning to the fleet, he entrusted the command of his army to his brother Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and sent him off to Hispania to carry on with the originally intended mission. Scipio returned to Italy to take command of the troops fighting in Cisalpine Gaul.

On his return to Italy, he advanced at once to meet Hannibal. In a sharp cavalry engagement near the Ticinus, a tributary of the Po river, he was defeated and severely wounded. In December of the same year, he again witnessed the complete defeat of the Roman army at the Trebia, when his fellow consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus allegedly insisted on fighting against his advice.

Despite the military defeats, he still retained the confidence of the Roman people; his term of command was extended and the following year found him in Hispania with his brother Calvus, winning victories over the Carthaginians and strengthening Rome&#x27;s position in the Iberian peninsula. He continued the Iberian campaigns until 211, when he was killed during the defeat of his army at the upper Baetis river by the Carthaginians and their Iberian allies under Indibilis and Mandonius. That same year, Calvus and his army were destroyed at Ilorci near Carthago Nova. The details of these campaigns are not completely known, but it seems that the ultimate defeat and death of the two Scipiones was due to the desertion of the Celtiberians, who were bribed by Hasdrubal Barca, Hannibal&#x27;s brother.

At his funeral, a certain Lucius Marcius was giving a speech when suddenly, his head spontaneously caught on fire. This has been interpreted as a divine message to Scipio&#x27;s soldiers for them to avenge his death.

The son of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, he was the father of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (the elder), and of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus.

<text>Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus (died 211 BC) was a Roman general and statesman during the third century BC. He played a major part in the Second Punic War, establishing Roman rule in the east of the Iberian peninsula and tying up several Carthaginian armies to keep them from reinforcing Hannibal.

==Family==
Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus was a member of the patrician family of the Cornelii Scipiones. His father was Lucius Cornelius Scipio, consul of 259 BC, the son of the patrician censor of 280, Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus. His younger brother was Publius Cornelius Scipio, consul of 218 and father of the famous Scipio Africanus (the most famous of the Scipios). Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio was nicknamed Calvus (the bald) to distinguish him from his uncle, another Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, who was nicknamed Asina (donkey) and who had been consul twice during the First Punic War.

==Consulship==
Gnaeus Cornelius was elected consul for 222 BC with Marcus Claudius Marcellus as his co-consul. Both consuls led their armies against the Insubres of Cisalpine Gaul. Scipio laid siege to Acerrae, while Marcellus engaged the Insubres at Clastidium. After Acerrae fell, Scipio marched towards Mediolanum, drawing the Gauls out and routing them. He took that city and thereby forced the Gauls to submit to the Romans.

==The Second Punic War==
Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus fought in the Second Punic War. Though he never faced Hannibal himself, he played a major part in defeating him. At the start of the Second Punic War Gnaeus served as a legate in the army of his younger brother Publius, who was consul at the outbreak of the war in 218 BC. From 218 BC until his death in 211 BC he fought against the Carthaginians in Spain.

===Marching against Hannibal===
In 218, Gnaeus and his brother sailed with Publius&#x27; consular army to the allied Greek city of Massilia in southern Gaul. From there they planned to start operations against Hannibal and the Carthaginian holdings on the Iberian peninsula. Publius was informed Hannibal was to the north in Gaul, so he sent a cavalry force north up the eastern bank of the Rhone River, which clashed with a similar force of Numidian light cavalry. After a hard-fought skirmish, they managed to drive off the Numidians. Publius then marched his entire force north intending to do battle with Hannibal in Gaul. Meanwhile, Hannibal had marched east towards the Alps. Arriving at the deserted Carthaginian camp, Scipio learned that Hannibal was three days&#x27; march away and decided to send his army to the Iberian peninsula under the command of his elder brother Gnaeus, while he himself returned to Northern Italy to organize the defences.

===Invading the Iberian peninsula===
Gnaeus, with 20,000 infantry (2 Roman legions and 2 allied alae), 2,200 cavalry and 60 quinqueremes, sailed from Massilia and landed in eastern Spain at Emporion. The Greek cities of Emporion and Tarraco welcomed the Romans, and Gnaeus began to win over the Iberian tribes north of the Ebro. Hannibal had left a certain Hanno with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry to garrison the newly conquered territory north of the Ebro, he was seriously outnumbered so Hasdrubal Barca, who had been left in command of the Carthaginian army in southern Spain, decided to reinforce him and marched north with 8,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.

===Battle of Cissa===
Hanno, afraid he would lose the Iberians and all of the Cartiginian territory north of the Ebro if he waited any longer, marched and attacked the Romans just north of Tarraco, near a place called Cissa or Kissa. He fought a pitched battle, in which there were no brilliant maneuvers or ambushes; the armies just formed up and faced off. Being outnumbered two to one, Hanno was defeated relatively easily, losing 6,000 soldiers in battle. Furthermore, the Romans managed to capture the Carthaginian camp, along with 2,000 soldiers and Hanno himself. The camp contained all the baggage left by Hannibal. The prisoners also included Indibilis, an influential Iberian chieftain. The Romans also stormed the town of Cissa, though to the frustration of the Romans it did not contain any valuable booty.

===Battle of the Ebro River===

In spring 217 BC Gnaeus commanded a fleet of 55 warships (probably quinqueremes) during a naval battle near the mouth of the Ebro River. The Carthaginian naval contingent of 40 warships facing him was totally defeated after a surprise attack by the Roman ships. The Carthaginians lost 29 ships and the control of seas around the Iberian peninsula. Furthermore, the victory enhanced Roman prestige among the warlike Iberians.

===Battle of Dertosa===

In early 215 BC the Romans, under the joined command of the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Scipio, crossed the Ebro River. Hasdrubal marched north with his field army, and after some maneuvering the two armies faced of on the south bank of the Ebro River across from the town of Dertosa. The armies were about similar in size with the Scipio brothers having 30,000 infantry and 2,800 cavalry against Hasdrubal&#x27;s 25,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 20 elephants. Hasdrubal tried to emulate his brother Hannibal&#x27;s envelopment tactic (see: Cannae) but failed because the Roman cavalry held out and he could not close the trap. The Scipio brothers continued with their policy of subjugating the Iberian tribes and raiding Carthaginian possessions. After losing most of his field army, Hasdrubal had to be reinforced with the army that was to sail to Italy and reinforce Hannibal. Thus, by winning this battle, the Scipios had indirectly prevented the situation in Italy from getting worse in addition to improving their own situation in Iberia.

===Battles of the Upper Baetis===

In 212 BC, the Scipio brothers captured Castulo, a major mining town and the home of Hannibal&#x27;s wife Imilce. They then wintered at Castulo and Ilugia.

Over the last couple of years the strength of the Scipios army had been reduced by losses and the need to garrison their recently conquered territories Therefore, the brothers had hired around 20,000 Celt-Iberian mercenaries to supplement their field army to 40,000 men. With a large army at their back and observing that the Carthaginian commanders had deployed separately from each other the Scipio brothers decided to divide their forces. Publius led an army of Roman and allied soldiers to attack Mago Barca near Castulo, while Gnaeus took one-third of the Romans and all of the mercenaries to attack Hasdrubal Barca. This stratagem would lead to two battles which took place within a few days of each other; the Battle of Castulo and the Battle of Ilorca.

====Battle of Castulo====
As Publius neared Castulo, he was harassed day and night by Numidian light cavalry under Masinissa. When informed that Indibilis was moving across his line of retreat with 7,500 Iberians, Publius decided not to face Mago but to attack the Iberian chieftain. Leaving 2,000 soldiers in his camp under the legate Tiberius Fonteus, he marched out at night, to evade Masinissa&#x27;s cavalry, and launched an attack on the Iberians in the early morning. He caught Indibilis and his men by surprise and, with a numerical superiority, began to gain the upper hand in the ensuing action. The Iberians managed to hold off the Romans just long enough for Masinissa to arrive.

With the Numidian horse attacking their flank, the Roman assault on the Iberians began to slacken. Then Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco arrived with their combined armies. The Romans, after a grim struggle, broke and fled, leaving Publius and most of their comrades dead on the field. Mago gave the Numidians enough time to loot the dead before force marching the army towards Hasdrubal Barca&#x27;s position. A handful of Roman survivors managed to reach Fonteus&#x27;s camp.

====Battle of Ilorca====
Gnaeus Scipio had arrived at his objective first. Hasdrubal Barca decided to refuse battle and stayed within his fortified camp, he then managed to bribe the Celt-Iberian mercenaries to desert Gnaeus. This led to Hasdrubal&#x27;s army outnumbering that of Gnaeus. Still Hasdrubal bided his time, avoiding any battles with the Romans.

Gnaeus, having lost his numerical advantage, decided to withdraw north after Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco arrived with their armies. The Romans moved out of their camp, leaving their camp fires burning, and made for the Ebro at night. The Numidians located them the following day; their attacks forced the Romans to take position for the night on a hilltop near Ilorca. The combined Carthaginian armies arrived during the night. As the ground was too stony for digging the Romans tried to create a defensive wall with baggage and saddles. The Carthaginians easily overran these makeshift fortification, destroying Gnaeus&#x27;s army.

==Death==
Gnaeus died in battle, fighting the Carthaginians who had overrun his makeshift camp during the battle of Ilorca. His death did not end the Scipios’ war against the Carthaginians. His nephew Publius would play an even greater part in bringing down Hannibal and in establishing Roman rule over the Iberian peninsula.

==Descendants==
His son was Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica (nicknamed Nasica for his pointed nose), who was consul in 191 BC. He was the first Scipio Nasica and founded the Nasica branch of the Scipiades. Scipio Nasica&#x27;s son, another Scipio Nasica (nicknamed Corculum, with his full name being Publius Cornelius P.f. G.n. Scipio Nasica Corculum), married his second cousin Cornelia Africana Major, the eldest daughter of Scipio Africanus, and thus united the two lines. Their descendants in the male line continued until at least 46 BC, in the person of Metellus Scipio (who was adopted into the Caecilii Metelli family).

<doc id="215274" wikidata="Q3284455" url="?curid=215274" title="Aftertaste (album)">
<text>Aftertaste is the fourth studio album by American alternative metal band Helmet, released in 1997 on Interscope. It was the band&#x27;s final album with original members John Stanier (drums) and Henry Bogdan (bass). Guitarist Rob Echeverria, who appeared on Helmet&#x27;s previous outing, &quot;Betty&quot;, left the group to join Biohazard. Subsequently, the album was recorded as a three-piece, with Page Hamilton covering all the guitar parts. Guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) came on board for the supporting tour.

&quot;Aftertaste&quot; harkens back to Helmet&#x27;s earlier sound, omitting some of the experimental/jazz tendencies of &quot;Betty&quot;. The album met with a mixed critical reaction from some critics, and a relatively poor commercial response, going out of print in 2006.

==Writing and music==
Hamilton claimed in July 1997 that his goal when writing the album was to create a greater mix between smarts and crunch:

&quot;I don&#x27;t want to say that I&#x27;m sick of the visceral animal response that we get - I&#x27;m not, But I need more than that. I need more than seeing a bunch of kids jumping around and breaking each other&#x27;s noses. I feel like I really need to communicate with an audience who will listen. I&#x27;m painted into a corner. Whatever I write in a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll context will elicit a conditioned response, unless I quit rock and make a country record or something.&quot;

In another interview from November 1997, Hamilton said that he and producer Dave Sardy initially wanted to make, &quot;the Helmet-est Helmet album&quot; and &quot;not think about the past or the future or anything, just sort of write Helmet songs.&quot; He added that he ended up discovering more about himself as a musician during the recording, and that, &quot;together we came up with this thing that&#x27;s distinctive and sounds like Helmet.&quot; John Stanier said to &quot;DRUM! Magazine&quot;, &quot;for &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, we wrote a few of the songs as a band, but as far as the arrangements go, no one tells me what to play. I have complete freedom. I pretty much can do whatever I want, and luckily, everyone seems to like it. Of course we all toss around ideas.&quot; During the recording of &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, Stanier syncopated a solo on &quot;Harmless&quot;, and he claims that he had the most trouble tracking the bridge to &quot;Birth Defect&quot;.

The penultimate track &quot;Insatiable&quot; is noted for being the heaviest on the album. There was only one known performance of the song in 1997, with its next known performance coming 22 years later in 2019. According to Hamilton, it has almost never been played live since he has difficulty hitting the vocal notes required for the screams.

==Release==
The album was close to being released in late 1996, and promotional interviews were held (such as for the &quot;Visions Magazine&quot; 09/1996 cover story), while advance tapes were also sent to journalists. A 1996 version of the track &quot;Insatiable&quot;, featuring the same intro that appeared as the final album&#x27;s intro to &quot;Pure&quot;, was released on the German &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;″s magazine CD &quot;Offroad Tracks Vol4&quot; in the fall of 1996. The album release was withdrawn and the mix duties were handed from producer Dave Sardy to Terry Date, with the recording process not being completed until a few months later. The version of &quot;Pure&quot; that appeared on the &quot;Exactly What You Wanted&quot; CD single in 1997 appears to be taken from this early version of the album. The track list of the early version would&#x27;ve held &quot;Insatiable&quot; as the opening track and &quot;Pure&quot; as the album closer. &quot;Renovation&quot; at the time was not included in the album as it was to be contributed exclusively to a soundtrack compilation album.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Aftertaste&quot; was a disappointment compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums; it debuted at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and fell off a mere five weeks later. By September 1997, it had sold 100,000 copies according to SoundScan. By 2004, it had sold 132,000 copies.

==Reception==

The album was met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics.

AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a negative review, writing &quot;Without the invention of &quot;Betty&quot; or the gut-level force of &quot;Meantime&quot;, Helmet is simply a bland alternative metal band, lacking riffs, hooks, and purpose and relying only on volume. It&#x27;s a shocking and disheartening turn of events for one of the more intriguing metal bands of the &#x27;90s.&quot; Kevin Templeton, writer for Vancouver music publication &quot;Drop-D&quot;, remarked in July 1997 that, &quot;Although I consider myself a fan of Helmet&#x27;s riffs... er, music, I can&#x27;t help feeling that they could sound a little more dangerous than this.&quot; Robert Parsons of &quot;Lollipop Magazine&quot; wrote in June 1997 that, &quot;&quot;Aftertaste&quot; brings us back to square one. After a not-so-Helmet effort with 1994’s &quot;Betty&quot;, Page Hamilton and company come back with full knuckle-busting, abrasive force&quot;, also praising the &quot;incredibly tight bass and drums on &#x27;Insatiable&#x27; and &#x27;Crisis King&#x27;&quot;. He noted Helmet&#x27;s influence on the contemporary music scene by saying, &quot;Silverchair cite the band as a major influence, while both Korn (who toured with Helmet) and Pantera borrow from Helmet’s stripped down metal, open-shut timing, and detuned guitars&quot;, and claimed, &quot;for Helmet fans, &quot;Aftertaste&quot; is a much-anticipated album that lives up to all expectations.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1997 compared it to the Rollins Band album &quot;Come In and Burn&quot;, which was released the same month, and which would also turn out to be the last album with most of their original lineup. The review remarks, &quot;Helmet&#x27;s &quot;Aftertaste&quot; and the Rollins Band&#x27;s &quot;Come In and Burn&quot; are prime examples of the &#x27;90s brand of paramilitary headbanging. With their drillsergeant demeanors and drill-press riffs, the Rollins Band and Helmet typify this Spartan approach to hard rock.&quot; Gabo Ronson of &quot;The Daily Eastern News&quot; gave &quot;Aftertaste&quot; four out of five stars in his 1997 review, labelling it a &quot;riff-heavy collection of songs that satisfies the headbanger in all of us.&quot; He observed that the album was &quot;pretty much heavy as hell all the way through&quot;, but noted that the track &quot;Renovation&quot;, &quot;strays from the hard-rocking stomp of &#x27;Pure&#x27; and attempts to delve into the world of punk/pop a la Green Day.&quot; He additionally wrote, &quot;the one thing I noticed after listening to this CD was the fact that there were a number of mainstream bands out right now that completely rip off Helmet.&quot; In April 1997, CMJ New Music Monthly writer M. Tye Comer characterized the album as having &quot;rough, masochistic guitar grooves that pummel with jackhammer intensity.&quot; Comer went on to add, &quot;while tracks like &#x27;Driving Nowhere&#x27; and &#x27;It&#x27;s Easy to Get Bored&#x27; hint at the melody-conscious outfit we saw on 1994&#x27;s &quot;Betty&quot;, &quot;Aftertaste&quot; is a more direct, more focused and less &#x27;adventurous&#x27; outing (i.e. there are fewer tracks to skip over).&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that the band, &quot;maintain a metal-machine beat as precise as their crew cuts&quot;, but criticized Hamilton&#x27;s vocals for making the songs &quot;cold and humorless&quot;.

===Legacy===
The album generally continues to divide listeners of the band, with some considering it comparable to Helmet&#x27;s earlier work, and others viewing it as the &quot;black sheep&quot; of their original 1990s discography. In a 2004 review of Helmet&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Size Matters&quot;, Blabbermouth.net labelled &quot;Aftertaste&quot; as &quot;okay but somewhat unsatisfactory&quot;, and &quot;an album that in some ways sounded as defeated as the band, wracked by inner turmoil&quot;. On the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2017, &quot;Diffuser.fm&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Aftertaste&quot; was less musically adventurous than &quot;Betty&quot;, going for more crunching, immediate riffing.&quot; They also observed that, &quot;The music scene had shifted somewhat dramatically in the nearly three years since &quot;Betty&quot;, and 1997 would ultimately be remembered for bands like Limp Bizkit and Coal Chamber creeping into the spotlight under the rise of nu metal which, incidentally, was a genre Helmet would end up credited by many to have primarily influenced.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; commented in 2019, &quot;had they stayed gone it would have made for a fine headstone.&quot; &quot;Louder Sound&quot; claimed in 2019 that &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Meantime&quot; were in a &quot;straight knife-fight&quot; for the title of the best Helmet album. Muse bassist Chris Wolstenholme has mentioned &quot;Aftertaste&quot; as his favourite album.

The songs &quot;Pure&quot;, &quot;Renovation&quot;, &quot;Like I Care&quot; and &quot;Exactly What You Wanted&quot; were included on the 2004 compilation album &quot;&quot;. The track listing for the compilation was chosen by Page Hamilton. Instrumental versions of &quot;Pure&quot;, &quot;Like I Care&quot;, &quot;Driving Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Birth Defect&quot; and &quot;Broadcast Emotion&quot; also appeared on a promotional 2003 release titled &quot;The Instrumental Music of Helmet (1992–1997)&quot;. A cover of &quot;(High) Visibility&quot; appears as a bonus track on Chevelle&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot;. &quot;Like I Care&quot; was covered by post-metal band Rosetta as part of the 2016 Helmet tribute album &quot;Meantime (Redux)&quot;.

== Touring and aftermath ==
Helmet&#x27;s first shows following the release of &quot;Aftertaste&quot; were with Korn and Limp Bizkit in North America and Europe, from March 1997 to June 1997. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s turntablist DJ Lethal had earlier worked with Helmet in 1993 on the song &quot;Just Another Victim&quot; for the &quot;Judgement Night&quot; soundtrack. Touring for &quot;Aftertaste&quot; continued through to December 1997, and other artists that Helmet performed alongside during the tour include Coal Chamber, Marilyn Manson, Melvins, Rasputina, Skeleton Key, Australian band Regurgitator and Swiss nu metal band Shovel. On June 13, 1997, they played at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, which featured Handsome (formed by ex-guitarist Peter Mengede). However, Handsome performed the day after Helmet at the festival. The run of shows with the Melvins occurred from July to October 1997, and were Helmet&#x27;s final shows in the USA before their 2004 reunion. Melvins member Buzz Osborne later recalled that his band received a hostile reception from Helmet&#x27;s fans at some shows. From October 22 to November 1, 1997, Helmet performed seven shows across Australia, and a single show in Auckland, New Zealand. After the Australia/New Zealand leg of the tour, the band went back to Europe for further shows. The band&#x27;s final performance prior to their breakup occurred in Italy on December 10, 1997. Helmet were inactive throughout 1998, with their breakup being officially confirmed towards the end of that year.

The &quot;Aftertaste&quot; tour was Helmet&#x27;s first with guitarist Chris Traynor, who had recently left Orange 9mm. In a 2018 interview, he said he believed that the original members, who were significantly older than him, had lost their enthusiasm for the band at that point. At their final show in Italy for example, Traynor claimed the audience wanted an encore, but that the other members refused. Traynor also recalled crying in a hotel room after a show in Manchester, England, since he knew it was inevitable that Helmet was going to breakup and that he would be left with no other band to play in. While the band never explicitly stated among themselves that it would be their last tour, Traynor claims, &quot;I knew it was over. It wasn&#x27;t said but you could feel that.&quot; Stanier reflected on the split in January 2004, saying, &quot;Helmet broke up and basically it was a really bad break up. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted to get into another band, but not right away. There weren&#x27;t really any [new gigs] popping up and from a combination of that and just wanting to take some time off, I accidentally turned into a DJ.&quot; Stanier along with Henry Bogdan declined Hamilton&#x27;s invitation to join Helmet&#x27;s 2004 reunion, Traynor however did join the reunion. At the time, Stanier publicly criticized Hamilton&#x27;s new Helmet in the media, and over the years has not kept in contact with him.

So far, no live recordings from the &quot;Aftertaste&quot; era have ever been officially released on B-sides or elsewhere. For the 20th anniversaries of &quot;Meantime&quot; and &quot;Betty&quot; in 2012 and 2014, the newer Helmet lineup performed those albums live in their entirety. This did not occur for the 20th anniversary of &quot;Aftertaste&quot; in 2017.

<text>MTV2 (formerly M2) is an American pay television channel owned by the Paramount Media Networks division of Paramount Global, through PMN’s MTV Entertainment Group Subdivision.

The channel launched initially as an all-music video service, once the original MTV had started to shift its programming. As with its parent network, MTV2&#x27;s focus on music programming would gradually be downplayed during the 2000s. By 2011, MTV2 would primarily target young adult men with original and acquired lifestyle and reality programming, reruns of male-targeting shows from MTV, acquired sitcoms and movies, and a daily block of hip hop and rock genre videos in the early mornings. 

Due to Viacom&#x27;s 2017 restructuring plan, MTV2&#x27;s original programs were eventually moved over to the flagship MTV network, while the former network would drop its music video blocks in November of that year.

, MTV2 is available to approximately 50,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2013 peak of 82,000,000 households.

In recent years, MTV2 has lost carriage with the growth of streaming alternatives including its parent company&#x27;s Paramount+, and has generally been depreciated by Paramount in current retransmission consent negotiations with cable and streaming providers.

==History==
===1996–1999: Early history as M2===

MTV2 began broadcasting as simply M2 on August 1, 1996 – MTV&#x27;s 15th anniversary – with Beck&#x27;s &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot; being the first video to air. A near &quot;flip side&quot; of MTV, the original format focused mostly on music and aimed at a slightly older audience (23-year-olds than MTV&#x27;s 21-year-olds), especially people who do not watch a lot of MTV.

In its first few years on the air, M2 was restricted to satellite television plus the few, small markets where digital cable was then available, limiting its audience reach to around 12 million homes by 2000. M2 also broadcast live over the internet during its early years, which meant it was similarly ahead of its time in a period when few people had broadband internet connections.

M2&#x27;s early years was known for its playful or ironic programming decisions that underscored the channel&#x27;s free-wheeling, subversive attitude; on January 1, 1999, M2 played the music video &quot;1999&quot; by Prince for 24 hours straight. M2 quickly gained favor with music insiders, and as its popularity and reputation grew within the music industry, it became common for musicians and record labels to request that their new videos premiere exclusively on M2 rather than MTV. Record companies often asked to have new artists appear on the channel in taped segments with the VJs. The Spice Girls made their first U.S. television appearance on M2, as did their video for &quot;Wannabe&quot;. At the time of their appearance on M2, the girl group was a huge success in the United Kingdom, but they were relatively unknown to U.S. audiences.

Starting on January 1, 2000, in honor of the millennium, MTV2 attempted to play every music video in the MTV library in alphabetical order. While a majority of videos were played, many were skipped over. The special ended in mid-April 2000.

===1999–2005: Relaunch as MTV2===

Due in part to the unexpectedly slow roll-out of the fledgling channel, MTV Networks decided to rebrand M2 in the first quarter of 1999, changing the name to MTV2. In 1997, MTV&#x27;s owner Viacom had bought out the rival music channel The Box. Starting on January 1, 2001, all households that had received The Box began to receive MTV2 in its place, putting the channel into millions of additional households. MTV2 also began adding television commercials to its broadcasts; beforehand, subscription providers interrupted MTV2&#x27;s feed to insert their own ads.
A new show hosted by Jancee Dunn called &quot;MTV2 Request&quot; aired every weekday between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. and again between 11 p.m. and midnight. All of the videos played on &quot;MTV2 Request&quot; were selected by online viewer requests. Another new show called &quot;Control Freak&quot; began in 2001, airing weekdays from 8 to 9 p.m. It used real-time viewer voting to select the next video to be played on the channel (out of three choices), while the current video was playing. The majority of the daytime schedule still featured a mix of rap, rock, and pop genre videos. By 2003, the network had 50 million subscribers in the United States.

During the Memorial Day weekend of 2002, MTV2 played a special called &quot;Increase The Beat&quot;. DJ Paul Oakenfold hosted the special and played videos from such artists as Fatboy Slim, Beastie Boys, and Jay-Z. The videos were arranged in order from slowest to fastest, based on the number of beats per minute of the song.

In 2003, Jesse Snider, son of Twisted Sister&#x27;s Dee Snider was selected as the new host of &quot;MTV2 Rock&quot;, replacing Abby Gennet. Another new program included &quot;Track 2&quot;, a series going &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of music videos, and &quot;Nose Dive&quot;, profiling past popular artists.

In May of that year, MTV2 relaunched the old MTV program &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, which featured a wide array of heavy metal and hard rock music videos. Metallica hosted the first episode, followed by Rob Zombie for the next few weeks.

In June, MTV2 began an eight-hour block of hip-hop programming on Sundays called &quot;Sucker Free Sunday&quot;. Each week, a different guest host served up &quot;Artist Collections&quot;, countdowns, and other hip-hop music specials. In July of that year, the channel also introduced a new advertising campaign – aimed at differentiating itself from its parent network, MTV – featuring The Talking Baby, a foul-mouthed baby doll operated by Charlotte-based comedian Sean Keenan.

Around this time, MTV2 sponsored two albums in the &quot;MTV2 Album Covers&quot; series, in which a band covers another band&#x27;s songs. The first was &quot;Dashboard Confessional/R.E.M.&quot;, and the second was &quot;Guster/Violent Femmes&quot;.

In early February 2004, MTV2 started to air Beavis and Butt-Head as a part of its regular programming and its MTV2OONS block, marking the first time the series had aired on TV in the US since around August 1999 on MTV.

===2005–2011: The two-headed dog===

In 2005, MTV2 rebranded with a new logo: a two-headed Rottweiler dog. Billboard reported that the double heads of the dog were made to represent rock and hip-hop, the two sides of music on MTV2.

From February 2007, MTV2 began scaling down music programming as a result of its production staff being archer. MTV2 would later devote Saturday evenings to rock music, usually during the primetime hours on Saturdays, but currently the block is shown on late Saturday evenings starting at 10:00 p.m. Other formats included a 30-minute block of videos that aired in the early mornings and late nights, as well as the &quot;No Break Video Hour&quot;, a music video block that excluded commercials, Tuesdays through Thursdays at 10:00 a.m.

MTV2 gave the cast of &quot;Human Giant&quot; free rein of the channel in May for an event called &quot;Human Giant: 24&quot;, allowing them to program the channel and host from MTV&#x27;s Times Square studios as they see fit for 24 hours, from 12 p.m. on May 18 to 12 p.m. on May 19. Notable guests included Fred Armisen and Bill Hader from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Bob Odenkirk, Michael Showalter, Todd Barry, Zach Galifianakis, Tapes &#x27;n Tapes, and Tegan and Sara. The live event was the successor to &quot;24 Hours of Love&quot; in 2002, &quot;24 Hours of Foo&quot; in 2005, and a subsequent Jackass special on MTV in early 2008.

Music programming was briefly expanded in June. From 4:30 p.m. on June 29 to 1:00 a.m. on July 1, 2007, MTV2 played strictly music videos, whether a general block of videos or a specific genre-based block such as &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; (heavy metal) or &quot;Sucker Free&quot; (hip-hop), for 33 hours and 30 minutes. Throughout the month of July 2007, MTV2 broadcast music video programs during primetime Mondays through Thursdays in its efforts to play more music. In February 2008, MTV2 replaced the 10 p.m. Eastern rebroadcast of &quot;Elite 8&quot; with a standard block of music videos.

2008 saw decreased availability for MTV2, as both Comcast and Cox Communications moved the channel from their widely received analog cable services to digital cable.

===2011–2017: Further success with original programming===
In 2011, MTV debuted a new original series called &quot;Guy Code&quot; on November 15. The series closed out its first season as the highest-rated program in network history, amassing significant time period increases among MTV2&#x27;s core male demographic with a 55% increase among men 12-34 and massive 188% increase in viewership among male teens, as well as a 44% increase among 12- to 34-year-olds overall. The second season of &quot;Guy Code&quot; closed out its sophomore run on September 25, 2012, as MTV2&#x27;s highest-rated and most-watched original series ever.

Music programming was seen during the &quot;AMTV2&quot; block, which aired Monday-Fridays from 4 to 9 a.m. AMTV2 was blocked in as &quot;MTV2 Jams&quot;, which runs from 4AM-8AM Eastern, and &quot;MTV2 Music Mix&quot; (known on-air as &quot;Morning Music Buzz&quot;), which runs from 8AM-9AM Eastern. &quot;Jams&quot; primarily features hip-hop music videos, while &quot;Music Mix&quot; features a mixture of hip-hop, rock, and alternative videos.

On October 28, 2012, MTV2 relaunched its &quot;Sucker Free&quot; series as &quot;The Week in Jams&quot;, followed by additional airings on MTV Jams. Where &quot;Sucker Free Countdown&quot; focused primarily on music, the expanded focus of &quot;The Week in Jams&quot; includes interviews, fashion trends, music, sports and hip-hop lifestyle. MTV recruited a stable of hip hop contributors to serve as the hosts of &quot;The Week in Jams&quot; and to provide expert commentary across MTV&#x27;s channels including: mixtape legend, radio personality and television host DJ Envy; industry insider, radio personality and cast member of &quot;MTV2&#x27;s Guy Code&quot; Charlamagne Tha God; Motown Records recording artist and songwriter Sofi Green; insider Maestro; and radio personality and nationally syndicated nighttime radio host Nessa, to join MTV hip hop expert and MTV News correspondent, Sway Calloway. The show hasn&#x27;t been seen on MTV2&#x27;s schedule since late 2013.

&quot;MTV Clubland&quot;, an EDM block on the flagship network, premiered on March 30, 2013; it continued to be seen on AMTV.

MTV2 next debuted &quot;Nitro Circus Live&quot;, an original series featuring 17-time X Games medalist Travis Pastrana and his sports-adventure troupe bridging the gap between extreme sports and unabashed daredevil antics, on March 27, 2012 . The first season of &quot;Nitro Circus Live&quot; became MTV2&#x27;s highest-rated original series among the network&#x27;s core demographic of men 12-34 since 2006, delivering an average rating of .42 and a 50% time period increase versus the year prior. In addition, the first season improved its prior year time period by 27%.

On May 22, 2012, MTV2 premiered the comedic game show &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot;, a revitalization of the iconic game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; that featured an original style and personality tailor-made for the network&#x27;s audience. The show stayed true to the tic-tac-toe format of the original game show, while infusing it with well-known personalities in hip-hop culture. A reboot of the series would premiere on VH1 in 2016. In addition, MTV2 brought back &quot;The Dub Magazine Project&quot; for a second season on October 28, 2012, to give viewers a unique and rarely seen glimpse into the lives and deepest obsessions of entertainment and sports personalities.

2013 saw MTV2 expand its original programming slate further with the premieres of &quot;Mac Miller and the Most Dope Family&quot;, the &quot;Guy Code&quot; spinoff, Guy Court; &quot;Ain&#x27;t that America&quot; and &quot;Charlamagne and Friends&quot;. After a six-year hiatus, a revival of &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out&quot; premiered on July 9, 2013. The premiere episode of season five had 1.1 million total viewers, the highest-rated telecast in the network&#x27;s history. During this time, MTV2 introduced a new version of the &quot;Two-Headed Dog&quot; logo, with the channel&#x27;s name rendered in a new font.

In 2014, MTV2 debuted &quot;Jobs That Don&#x27;t Suck&quot;, a show spotlighting young entrepreneurs, and the weekly series &quot;Off the Bat from the MLB Fan Cave&quot;, created from MTV&#x27;s partnership with Major League Baseball. On November 11, 2014, MTV2 renewed &quot;Wild n&#x27; Out&quot; &amp; &quot;Guy Code&quot; and greenlit two new series: a comedic game show, &quot;MTV2&#x27;s Joking Off&quot;, and a news satire series under the working title &quot;Number 2 News&quot;. Weeks after the announcement that the NBCUniversal-owned cable network, G4, will be shutting down, MTV2 began syndicating the &quot;Marvel Anime&quot; anthology, which previously aired on the former network.

Because of the popularity of MTV2&#x27;s original programming, the network was listed as one of Comedy Hype&#x27;s &quot;20 Game Changers of Comedy of 2015&quot;. &quot;Joking Off&quot; premiered on April 1, 2015, and &quot;Number 2 News&quot;, renamed &quot;Not Exactly News&quot;, premiered on June 17, 2015. In the Summer of 2015, MTV2 debuted the reality series, &quot;Kingin&#x27; with Tyga&quot;, and panel show, &quot;Uncommon Sense with Charlamagne&quot;.

===2017–present: Viacom restructuring===
Because of Viacom&#x27;s 2017 restructuring, in which most of the company&#x27;s resources were directed towards the flagship MTV network, MTV2 currently has no original programming. In the previous year, several of MTV2&#x27;s remaining original programs moved to MTV.

==Programming==

As of 2021, MTV2 primarily airs movies, acquired sitcoms and reality shows, as well as reruns of MTV programming and other shows from its sibling owned networks.

==Broadcast affiliates==
From 2001 until 2015, MTV2 had a small network of terrestrial television affiliates that carried the network for free as a result of MTV&#x27;s purchase of The Box in 2001. The broadcast network branch slowly thinned out as other parties purchased stations, with some leaving the air as a result of the digital transition dislocating those stations from their channel positions, and in most cases, the retransmission consent contracts for Viacom&#x27;s networks, including MTV2, precluded these stations from having any cable or satellite carriage on their own, notwithstanding existing complications involving low-power stations and cable carriage. The over-the-air stations also created a side effect of requiring MTV2&#x27;s programming to meet the FCC&#x27;s broadcast safe harbor and in some cases, educational and informational programming requirements. Eventually, Viacom let their affiliation agreements lapse with their broadcast affiliates, and those other stations have become affiliates of other networks, or ceased all operations.

==International versions==

In addition to the original MTV2 channel in the United States, there have been a number of other MTV Networks channels around the world known as MTV2.
* Europe: MTV Rocks, which focused solely on alternative rock and indie, broadcast from London. It was called MTV Two.
* Canada: MTV2 in Canada was very similar to its American counterpart; however, it had VJs who host shows such as MTV2 Videos (music videos). The original incarnation of MTV2 featured a non-stop freeform mix of music videos as well as a select number of concert performances. It was replaced by &quot;PunchMuch&quot; (now known as Juicebox) in June 2005. It was closed on March 29, 2024.
* Germany: A version of MTV2 was replaced by Nick in September 2005. Unlike the original, MTV2 Pop was a mainstream channel. However, MTV Rocks is being offered by several pay-TV services.

<doc id="215280" wikidata="Q361377" url="?curid=215280" title="Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus">
<text>Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (properly Asiagenes; 3rd century BC – after 183 BC) was a general and statesman of the Roman Republic. He was the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio and the younger brother of Scipio Africanus. He was elected consul in 190 BC, and later that year led (with his brother) the Roman forces to victory at the Battle of Magnesia.

Although his career may be eclipsed by the shadow of his elder brother, Lucius&#x27; life is noteworthy in several respects.

==Family background==
Lucius belonged to the patrician &quot;gens&quot; Cornelia, one of the most important gentes of the Republic, which counted more consulships than any other. He was the son of Publius, the consul of 218 who died against the Carthaginians at the Battle of the Upper Baetis in 211, and Pomponia, the daughter of Manius Pomponius Matho, consul in 233. Lucius also had an elder brother, Publius, better known as Scipio Africanus, who was the leading man of his generation and the vanquisher of Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 202. Lucius was very close to his brother throughout his career, but had a conflicting relationship with his cousin Scipio Nasica since both of them were born circa 228, and therefore fought for the same magistracies at each stage of their &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

Lucius&#x27; wife is not known.

==Early career==
Lucius served under his brother in Spain during the Second Punic War, defeating the Carthaginian commander Larus in a famous duel, and in 208 BC took a town on his own. In 206 BC, he was sent to the Senate with news of the victory in Spain. He was curule aedile in 195 BC, and praetor assigned to Sicily in 193 BC, helped by the influence of his brother. He was a candidate for consul in 191 BC, but lost to his first cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica.

==Consul==
He was finally elected consul in 190 BC with his co-consul being his brother&#x27;s old second-in-command Gaius Laelius. According to Smith, the senate had not much confidence in his abilities (Cic. Phil. xi. 17), and it was only through the offer of his brother Africanus to accompany him as a legate that he obtained the province of Greece and the conduct of the war against Antiochus.

He asserted himself against his brother by refusing the peace negotiated with the Aetolians by the latter. However, Publius insisted that as supreme commander at Magnesia Lucius should receive full credit for the victory over Antiochus. Upon his return to Rome, he celebrated a triumph (189 BC) and requested the title &quot;Asiaticus&quot; to signify his conquest of Western Asia Minor.

According to some biblical commentators, Asiaticus is the &quot;commander&quot; referred to in Daniel 11:18, where it says that &quot;a commander will put an end to his insolence&quot; (NIV).

==Political fall==
Towards the end of his brother&#x27;s life, Lucius was accused of misappropriating some of the funds collected from Antiochus as an indemnity. Africanus, then Princeps Senatus, was outraged, going so far as to destroy the campaign&#x27;s financial records while speaking in the Senate, as an act of defiance.

After his brother&#x27;s death (c. 183 BC), Lucius was imprisoned for this alleged theft. He was eventually pardoned by the tribune Tiberius Gracchus, although he was forced to sell his property and pay the state a lump sum. Roman historians report that he refused to accept any gifts or loans from his friends to pay the penalty.

During his brother&#x27;s lifetime in 185 BC, Lucius celebrated with great splendour the games which he had vowed in his war with Antiochus. Valerius of Antium related that he obtained the necessary money during an embassy on which he was sent after his condemnation, to settle the disputes between the kings Antiochus and Eumenes.

He was a candidate for the censorship in 184 BC, but was defeated by an old enemy of his family, M. Porcius Cato, who deprived Lucius of his Public Horse at the review of the &quot;equites&quot;.

==Descendants==
Lucius had descendants, the &quot;Cornelii Scipiones Asiatici&quot;, the last of whom was the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus who had an adoptive son. This son passed into obscurity after 82 BC.

<text>Vincent Louis Gigante ( , ; March 29, 1928 – December 19, 2005), also known as &quot;Chin&quot;, was an American mobster who was boss of the Genovese crime family in New York City from 1981 to 2005. Gigante started out as a professional boxer who fought in 25 matches between 1944 and 1947. He then started working as a Mafia enforcer for what was then the Luciano crime family, forerunner of the Genovese family. Gigante was one of five brothers. Three of them, Mario, Pasquale, and Ralph, followed him into the Mafia. Only one brother, Louis, stayed out of the crime family, instead becoming a Catholic priest. Gigante was the shooter in the failed assassination of longtime Luciano boss Frank Costello in 1957. In 1959, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for drug trafficking, and after sharing a prison cell with Costello&#x27;s rival, Vito Genovese, Gigante became a caporegime overseeing his own crew of Genovese soldiers and associates based in Greenwich Village.

Gigante quickly rose to power during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1981 he became the family&#x27;s boss, while Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno served as front boss during the first half of the 1980s. He also ordered the failed murder attempt of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti in 1986. With the arrest and conviction of Gotti and various Gambino family members in 1992, Gigante was recognized as the most powerful crime boss in the United States. For about 30 years, Gigante feigned insanity in an effort to throw law enforcement off his trail. 

Dubbed &quot;The Oddfather&quot; and &quot;The Enigma in the Bathrobe&quot; by the media, Gigante often wandered the streets of Greenwich Village in his bathrobe and slippers, mumbling incoherently to himself. He was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1990, but was determined to be mentally unfit to stand trial. In 1997, he was tried and convicted of racketeering and conspiracy, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Facing obstruction of justice charges in 2003, he pleaded guilty and admitted that his supposed insanity was an elaborate effort to avoid prosecution, as he was sentenced to an additional three years in prison. He died in the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners on December 19, 2005.

== Early life and boxing career ==
Gigante was born in New York City to Italian immigrants from Naples, Salvatore Gigante, a watchmaker, and Yolanda Gigante (née Scotto), a seamstress. He had four brothers, Mario, Pasquale, and Ralph, who followed him into a life of organized crime, and Louis, who became a Catholic priest at St. Athanasius Church in the South Bronx and city councilman. According to his brother Louis, his nickname, &quot;The Chin&quot;, stemmed from their mother affectionately calling him &quot;Chinzeeno&quot; as a boy, derived from the name Vincenzo, the Italian form of Vincent. Gigante graduated from Public School 3 in West Village, Manhattan and later attended Textile High School, but dropped out.

Gigante was a professional light heavyweight boxer between 1944 and 1947, who was known as &quot;The Chin&quot; Gigante. He fought 25 matches and lost four, boxing 117 rounds. His first professional boxing match was against Vic Chambers on July 18, 1944, in Union City, New Jersey, which he lost. He then fought Chambers a second time at the St. Nicholas Arena on October 6, 1944, and defeated him. He defeated him again on June 29, 1945, at Madison Square Garden. His last match was against Jimmy Slade on May 17, 1947, at Ridgewood Grove, Brooklyn, which he lost by technical knockout.

Gigante lived in Old Tappan, New Jersey, with his wife Olympia Grippa, whom he married in 1950, and their five children, Andrew, Salvatore, Yolanda, Roseanne, and Rita. He had a second family at a townhouse in the Upper East Side, Manhattan with his longtime mistress and common-law wife, Olympia Esposito and their three children, Vincent, Lucia and Carmella. He often stayed at his mother&#x27;s apartment in Greenwich Village.

== Criminal career ==
=== Costello murder attempt and caporegime ===

As a teenager, Gigante became the protégé of future Genovese crime family patriarch Vito Genovese, who had helped pay for Gigante&#x27;s mother&#x27;s surgery. Between the ages of 17 and 25, he was arrested seven times on charges ranging from receiving stolen goods, possession of an unlicensed handgun, and illegal gambling and bookmaking. Most were dismissed or resolved by fines, except for a 60-day jail-stay for a gambling conviction. During this time, Gigante listed his occupation as a tailor.

In the 1960s, Gigante took to walking around his neighborhood in a bathrobe, pajamas, and slippers while mumbling to himself, which law enforcement agents, prosecutors, and Mafia defectors later said was a performance intended to allow Gigante to avoid prosecution for his criminal activities. This came to be known as &quot;The Bathrobe Defense&quot;, in which those accused of criminal wrongdoing feign mental incompetence to avoid the legal consequence of such behavior.

In early 1957, Genovese decided to move on Luciano family boss Frank Costello. Genovese ordered Gigante to murder Costello, and on May 2, 1957, Gigante shot and wounded Costello outside his apartment building. Although the wound was superficial, it persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and retire. Genovese then controlled what is now called the Genovese crime family. A doorman identified Gigante as the gunman. In 1958, Costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant. Gigante was acquitted on charges of attempted murder.
In 1959, Gigante was convicted, with Vito Genovese, of heroin trafficking and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was paroled after five years. Not long afterward, he was promoted from soldier to captain, running the Greenwich Village Crew, and headquartered at the Triangle Civic Improvement Association.

In 1969, Gigante was indicted in New Jersey for conspiracy to bribe the entire five-member Old Tappan, New Jersey police force to alert him to surveillance operations by law enforcement agencies. The charge was dropped after Gigante&#x27;s lawyers presented reports from psychiatrists that he was mentally unfit to stand trial.

Since 1969, Gigante had been treated 20 times for psychiatric disorders. Gigante&#x27;s &quot;primary treating psychiatrist&quot;, Eugene D&#x27;Adamo, noted: 

Gigante&#x27;s lawyers and relatives said that Gigante had been mentally disabled since the late 1960s, with a below-normal IQ of 69 to 72.

=== Genovese crime boss ===

In 1981, Genovese&#x27;s successor, Philip &quot;Benny Squint&quot; Lombardo, stepped down as boss due to poor health. With Lombardo&#x27;s support, Gigante became boss of the Genovese family. Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno was made front boss of the Genovese family to fool law enforcement.

Gigante built a vast network of bookmaking and loansharking rings and from extortions of garbage, shipping, trucking, and construction companies seeking labor peace or contracts from carpenters&#x27;, Teamsters and laborers&#x27; unions, including those at the Javits Center, as well as protection payoffs from merchants at the Fulton Fish Market. Gigante also had influence in the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy, operating gambling games, extorting payoffs from vendors, and pocketing thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church—until a 1995 crackdown by New York City officials.

On April 13, 1986, Gambino crime family underboss Frank DeCicco was killed when his car was bombed following a visit to Paul Castellano loyalist James Failla. The bombing was carried out by Victor Amuso and Anthony Casso of the Lucchese crime family, under orders of Gigante and Lucchese boss Anthony Corallo, to avenge Castellano and Thomas Bilotti by killing their successors. John Gotti planned to visit Failla that day, but canceled, and the bomb was detonated after a soldier who rode with DeCicco was mistaken for the boss.

In January 1987, Salerno was sentenced to 100 years in prison for racketeering, along with top members of the other New York families, as part of the Mafia Commission Trial. Salerno had initially been billed as the boss of the Genovese family, but shortly after the trial, Salerno&#x27;s longtime right-hand man, Vincent &quot;The Fish&quot; Cafaro, turned informant and told the FBI that Salerno had been a front for the real boss, Gigante. Cafaro revealed that the Genovese family had been keeping up this ruse since 1969. FBI bugs had captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew &quot;Matty the Horse&quot; Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates to become made members in another family. Frustrated that the nicknames of the potential inductees had not been included, Salerno shrugged and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll leave this up to the boss.&quot;

Gigante was reclusive, and almost impossible to capture on wiretaps, speaking softly, eschewing the phone, and even at times whistling into the receiver. He almost never left his home unoccupied because he knew FBI agents would sneak in and plant a bug. Genovese members were not allowed to mention Gigante&#x27;s name in conversations or phone calls. When they had to mention him, members pointed to their chins or made the letter &quot;C&quot; with their fingers.

During Gigante&#x27;s tenure as boss of the Genovese family, after the imprisonment of John Gotti in 1992, Gigante came to be known as the figurehead &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;, the &quot;Boss of All Bosses&quot;, despite the position being abolished in 1931 with the murder of Salvatore Maranzano.

=== Trials and conviction ===

From 1978 to 1990, four of the five crime families of New York, including the Genovese family, rigged bids for 75% of $191 million, or about $142 million, of the window contracts awarded by the New York City Housing Authority. Installation companies were required to make union payoffs between $1 and $2 for each window installed.

In 1988, Gigante had open-heart surgery. On May 30, 1990, Gigante was indicted along with other members of four of the New York crime families for conspiring to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion-dollar contracts with the New York City Housing Authority to install windows. Gigante attended his arraignment in pajamas and bathrobe. Due to his defense that he was mentally and physically impaired, legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial.

In June 1993, Gigante was under indictment again, charged with sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others, including Gambino boss John Gotti. At sanity hearings in March 1996, Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, former underboss of the Gambino crime family, who became a cooperating witness in 1991, and Alphonse &quot;Little Al&quot; D&#x27;Arco, former acting boss of the Lucchese family, testified that Gigante was lucid at top-level Mafia meetings and that he had told other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense. Gigante&#x27;s lawyers got testimony and reports from psychiatrists that from 1969 to 1995 Gigante had been confined 28 times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from &quot;dementia rooted in organic brain damage&quot;.

In August 1996, senior judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York Eugene Nickerson ruled that Gigante was mentally competent to stand trial. He pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bail. Gigante had another cardiac operation in December 1996. On June 25, 1997, Gigante&#x27;s trial started. Gigante stood trial in a wheelchair. On July 25, 1997, after almost three days of deliberations, the jury convicted Gigante of conspiring in plots to kill other mobsters and of running rackets as head of the Genovese family. Prosecutors said the verdict finally established that Gigante was not mentally ill, as his lawyers and relatives had long maintained.

On December 18, 1997, Gigante was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined $1.25 million by judge Jack B. Weinstein, a lenient sentence due to Gigante&#x27;s &quot;age and frailty&quot;. Weinstein declared that Gigante had been &quot;finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny&quot;. While in prison, he maintained his role as boss of the Genovese family, while other mobsters were entrusted to run the family&#x27;s day-to-day activities. Gigante relayed orders to the crime family through his son, Andrew, who visited him in prison.

On January 23, 2002, Gigante was indicted with several other mobsters, including his son Andrew, on racketeering and obstruction of justice charges. Prosecutors accused him of continuing to rule his family from prison and using Andrew to funnel messages to the family. They also wanted him held responsible for causing a seven-year delay in his previous trial by feigning insanity. Several days later, Andrew was released on $2.5 million bail. Federal prosecutor Roslynn R. Mauskopf had planned to play tapes showing him &quot;fully coherent, careful and intelligent,&quot; running crime operations from prison. Faced with this evidence, Gigante pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice on April 7, 2003, just hours before the trial was to start. Judge I. Leo Glasser sentenced him to an additional three years in prison. Mauskopf said, &quot;The jig is up ... Vincent Gigante was a cunning faker, and those of us in law enforcement always knew that this was an act ... The act ran for decades, but today it&#x27;s over.&quot;

On July 25, 2003, Andrew Gigante was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $2.5 million for racketeering and extortion. &quot;The New York Times&quot; organized-crime reporter and mob historian Selwyn Raab described Gigante&#x27;s plea deal as an &quot;unprecedented capitulation&quot; for a Mafia boss. It was almost unheard of for a boss to even consider pleading guilty. Gigante agreed to the deal to ease the burden on his relatives. For instance, Andrew faced up to 20 years in prison had he gone to trial. Another provision of the plea agreement stipulated that any relatives who helped in his deception, including his wife, mistress, and Father Louis, would not be charged with obstruction of justice.

== Death ==
Gigante died on December 19, 2005, at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. His funeral and burial were held four days later, on December 23, at Saint Anthony of Padua Church in Greenwich Village, largely in anonymity.

Since Gigante&#x27;s death, his family has continued to live well. According to a 2011 report by Jerry Capeci, Gigante&#x27;s relatives earn nearly $2 million a year as employees of companies on the New Jersey waterfront.

<doc id="215288" wikidata="Q2092537" url="?curid=215288" title="Wardialing">
<text>Wardialing (or war dialing) is a technique to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers, usually dialing every number in a local area code to search for modems, computers, bulletin board systems (computer servers) and fax machines. Hackers use the resulting lists for various purposes: hobbyists for exploration, and crackers—malicious hackers who specialize in breaching computer security—for guessing user accounts (by capturing voicemail greetings), or locating modems that might provide an entry-point into computer or other electronic systems. It may also be used by security personnel, for example, to detect unauthorized devices, such as modems or faxes, on a company&#x27;s telephone network.

==Process==

A single wardialing call would involve calling an unknown number, and waiting for one or two rings, since answering computers usually pick up on the first ring. If the phone rings twice, the modem hangs up and tries the next number. If a modem or fax machine answers, the wardialer program makes a note of the number. If a human or answering machine answers, the wardialer program hangs up. Depending on the time of day, wardialing 10,000 numbers in a given area code might annoy dozens or hundreds of people, some who attempt and fail to answer a phone in two rings, and some who succeed, only to hear the wardialing modem&#x27;s carrier tone and hang up. The repeated incoming calls are especially annoying to businesses that have many consecutively numbered lines in the exchange, such as used with a Centrex telephone system.

Some newer wardialing software, such as WarVOX, does not require a modem to conduct wardialing. Rather, such programs can use VOIP connections, which can speed up the number of calls that a wardialer can make. Sandstorm Enterprises has a patent on a multi-line war dialer. (&quot;System and Method for Scan-Dialing Telephone Numbers and Classifying Equipment Connected to Telephone Lines Associated therewith.&quot;) The patented technology is implemented in Sandstorm&#x27;s PhoneSweep war dialer.

==Etymology==
The popular name for this technique originated in the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;. In the film, the protagonist programmed his computer to dial every telephone number in Sunnyvale, California to find other computer systems. Prior to the movie&#x27;s release, this technique was known as &quot;hammer dialing&quot; or &quot;demon dialing&quot;, but the film introduced the method to many, such as the members of The 414s. By 1985 at least one company advertised a &quot;War Games Autodialer&quot; for Commodore computers. Such programs became common on bulletin board systems of the time, with file names often truncated to wardial.exe and the like due to length restrictions of 8 characters on such systems. Eventually, the etymology of the name fell behind as &quot;war dialing&quot; gained its own currency within computing culture.

The popularity of wardialing in 1980s and 1990s prompted some states to enact legislation prohibiting the use of a device to dial telephone numbers without the intent of communicating with a person.

==Variants==

A more recent phenomenon is wardriving, the searching for wireless networks (Wi-Fi) from a moving vehicle. Wardriving was named after wardialing, since both techniques involve actively scanning to find computer networks. The aim of wardriving is to collect information about wireless access points (not to be confused with piggybacking).

Similar to war dialing is a port scan under TCP/IP, which &quot;dials&quot; every TCP port of every IP address to find out what services are available. Unlike wardialing, however, a port scan will generally not disturb a human being when it tries an IP address, regardless of whether there is a computer responding on that address or not. Related to wardriving is warchalking, the practice of drawing chalk symbols in public places to advertise the availability of wireless networks.

The term is also used today by analogy for various sorts of exhaustive brute force attack against an authentication mechanism, such as a password. While a dictionary attack might involve trying each word in a dictionary as the password, &quot;wardialing the password&quot; would involve trying every possible password. Password protection systems are usually designed to make this impractical, by making the process slow and/or locking out an account for minutes or hours after some low number of wrong password entries.

<doc id="215289" wikidata="Q434266" url="?curid=215289" title="P. D. Ouspensky">
<text>Pyotr Demyanovich Uspensky (; 5 March 1878 – 2 October 1947), known in English as P. D. Ouspensky, was a Russian philosopher and esotericist known for his expositions of the early work of the Greek-Armenian teacher of esoteric doctrine George Gurdjieff. He met Gurdjieff in Moscow in 1915, and was associated with the ideas and practices originating with Gurdjieff from then on. He taught ideas and methods based in the Gurdjieff system for 25 years in England and the United States, although he separated from Gurdjieff personally in 1924, for reasons that are explained in the last chapter of his book &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;.

Ouspensky studied the Gurdjieff system directly under Gurdjieff&#x27;s own supervision for a period of ten years, from 1915 to 1924. &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot; recounts what he learned from Gurdjieff during those years. While lecturing in London in 1924, he announced that he would continue independently the way he had begun in 1921. Some, including his close pupil Rodney Collin, say that he finally gave up the system in 1947, just before his death, but his own recorded words on the subject (&quot;A Record of Meetings&quot;, published posthumously) do not clearly endorse this judgement.

== Early life ==
Ouspensky was born in Moscow, Russian Empire in 1878. In 1890, he studied at the Second Moscow Gymnasium, a government school attended by boys aged 10 to 18. At the age of 16, he was expelled from school for painting graffiti on the wall in plain sight of a visiting inspector. From then on he was more or less on his own. In 1906, he worked in the editorial office of the Moscow daily paper &quot;The Morning&quot;. In 1907 he became interested in Theosophy. In the autumn of 1913, aged 35, he journeyed to the East in search of the miraculous. He visited Theosophists in Adyar in Tamil Nadu, India, but was forced to return to Moscow after the beginning of the Great War. In Moscow he met Gurdjieff and married Sophie Grigorievna Maximenko. He had a mistress by the name of Anna Ilinishna Butkovsky.

==Career==
During his years in Moscow, Ouspensky wrote for several newspapers and was particularly interested in the then-fashionable idea of the fourth dimension. His first work, published in 1909, was titled &quot;The Fourth Dimension&quot;. It was influenced by the ideas prevalent in the works of Charles H. Hinton, which treat the fourth dimension as an extension in space. Ouspensky treats time as a fourth dimension only indirectly in a novel he wrote titled &quot;Strange Life of Ivan Osokin&quot; where he also explores the theory of eternal recurrence.

Ouspensky&#x27;s second work, &quot;Tertium Organum&quot;, was published in 1912. In it he denies the ultimate reality of space and time, and negates Aristotle&#x27;s Logical Formula of Identification of &quot;A is A&quot;, concluding in his &quot;higher logic&quot; that A is both A and not-A. Unbeknown to Ouspensky, a Russian émigré by the name of Nicholas Bessarabof took a copy of &quot;Tertium Organum&quot; to America and placed it in the hands of the architect Claude Bragdon, who could read Russian and was interested in the fourth dimension. &quot;Tertium Organum&quot; was rendered into English by Bragdon, who had incorporated his own design of the hypercube into the Rochester Chamber of Commerce building. Bragdon also published the book, and the publication was such a success that it was finally taken up by Alfred A. Knopf. At the time, in the early 1920s, Ouspensky&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown. Bragdon located him in Constantinople and paid him back some royalties.

Ouspensky traveled in Europe and the East — India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Egypt — in his search for knowledge. After his return to Russia and his introduction to Gurdjieff in 1915, he spent the next few years studying with him, and supporting the founding of a school.

Prior to 1914, Ouspensky had written and published a number of articles. In 1917, he updated these articles to include &quot;recent developments in physics&quot; and republished them as a book in Russian entitled &quot;A New Model of the Universe&quot;. The work, as reflected in its title, shows the influence of Francis Bacon and Max Müller, and has been interpreted as an attempt to reconcile ideas from natural science and religious studies with esoteric teachings in the tradition of Gurdjieff and Theosophy. It was assumed that the book was lost to the Russian Revolution&#x27;s violence, but it was then republished in English (without Ouspensky&#x27;s knowledge) in 1931. The work has attracted the interest of a number of philosophers and has been a widely accepted authoritative basis for a study of metaphysics. Ouspensky sought to exceed the limits of metaphysics with his &quot;psychological method&quot;, which he defined as &quot;a calibration of the tools of human understanding to derive the actual meaning of the thing itself&quot; (paraphrasing p. 75.). According to Ouspensky, &quot;The idea of esotericism ... holds that the very great majority of our ideas are not the product of evolution but the product of the degeneration of ideas which existed at some time or are still existing somewhere in much higher, purer and more complete forms&quot; (p. 47). The book also provided an original discussion on the nature and expression of sexuality; among other things, he draws a distinction between erotica and pornography.

Ouspensky&#x27;s lectures in London were attended by such literary figures as Aldous Huxley, T. S. Eliot, Gerald Heard and other writers, journalists and doctors. His influence on the literary scene of the 1920s and 1930s as well as on the Russian avant-garde was immense but remains very little known. It was said of Ouspensky that, though nonreligious, he had one prayer: not to become famous during his lifetime.

==Later life==
After the Bolshevik revolution, Ouspensky travelled to London by way of Istanbul. In London, a number of eminent people became interested in his work. Lady Rothermere, wife of Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, a press magnate, was willing to promote &quot;Tertium Organum&quot;. The influential intellectual and editor A. R. Orage became deeply interested in Ouspensky&#x27;s ideas and promoted their discussion in various circles. Prominent theosophist and editor G. R. S. Mead became interested in his ideas on the fourth dimension.

By order of the British government, Gurdjieff was not allowed to settle in London. Gurdjieff eventually went to France with a considerable sum of money raised by Ouspensky and his friends, and settled down near Paris at the Prieuré in Fontainebleau-Avon. It was during this time, after Gurdjieff founded his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in France, that Ouspensky came to the conclusion that he was no longer able to understand his former teacher and made a decision to discontinue association with him. He set up his own organisation, The Society for the Study of Normal Psychology, which is now known as The Study Society.

Ouspensky wrote about Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings in a book originally entitled &quot;Fragments of an Unknown Teaching&quot;, published posthumously in 1947 under the title &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;. While this volume has been criticized by some of those who have followed Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings as only a partial representation of the totality of his ideas, it provides what is probably the most concise explanation of the material that was included. This is in sharp contrast to the writings of Gurdjieff himself, such as &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot;, where the ideas and precepts of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings are found very deeply veiled in allegory. Initially, Ouspensky had intended this book to be published only if &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; were not published. But after his death, Mme. Ouspensky showed its draft to Gurdjieff, who praised its accuracy and permitted its publication.

With the effect of the commencement of the Second World War on Britain, Ouspensky emigrated, with his wife, to the U.S. They settled on a farm in New Jersey. The Ouspenskys moved back to their former home region in the U.K. after the war was over. Ouspensky died in Lyne Place, Surrey, in 1947. Shortly after his death, &quot;The Psychology of Man&#x27;s Possible Evolution&quot; was published, together with &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;. A facsimile edition of &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot; was published in 2004 by Paul H. Crompton Ltd. London. Transcripts of some of his lectures were published under the title of &quot;The Fourth Way&quot; in 1957; largely a collection of question and answer sessions, the book details important concepts, both introductory and advanced, for students of these teachings.

Ouspensky&#x27;s papers are held at Yale University Library&#x27;s Manuscripts and Archives department.

==Teaching==

After Ouspensky broke away from Gurdjieff, he taught the &quot;Fourth Way&quot;, as he understood it, to his independent groups.

===Fourth Way===

Gurdjieff proposed that there are three ways of self-development generally known in esoteric circles. These are the Way of the Fakir, dealing exclusively with the physical body, the Way of the Monk, dealing with the emotions, and the Way of the Yogi, dealing with the mind. What is common to all three ways is that they demand complete seclusion from the world. According to Gurdjieff, there is a Fourth Way which does not demand its followers to abandon the world. The work of self-development takes place right in the midst of ordinary life. Gurdjieff called his system a school of the Fourth Way in which a person learns to work in harmony with his physical body, emotions and mind. Ouspensky picked up this idea and continued his own school along this line.

Ouspensky made the term &quot;Fourth Way&quot; and its use central to his own teaching of the ideas of Gurdjieff. He greatly focused on Fourth Way schools and their existence throughout history.

===Students===

Among his students were Rodney Collin, Maurice Nicoll, Robert S. de Ropp, Kenneth Walker, and Remedios Varo.

===Self-remembering===

Ouspensky personally confessed the difficulties he was experiencing with &#x27;self-remembering&#x27; - the practice of a deep state of mindfulness, rooting one in the present moment, whatever one is doing. (The present definition of the term in the teachings of Advaita is “to be in awareness”, or “being aware of being aware”, while in Buddhism the corresponding practice is &#x27;mindfulness&#x27;). &#x27;Self-remembering&#x27; was a technique to which Ouspensky had been introduced by Gurdjieff himself, the teacher having explained to him that self-remembering is the key to all else in ‘the Work’. While in Russia, Ouspensky experimented with the technique with a certain degree of success, and in his lectures in London and America he emphasized the importance of its practice. The technique requires a division of attention, so that a person not only pays attention to what is going on in the exterior world but also in the interior. A. L. Volinsky, an acquaintance of Ouspensky in Russia, mentioned to him that this was what Wundt meant by apperception. Ouspensky disagreed and commented on how an idea so profound to him would pass unnoticed by people whom he considered intelligent. Gurdjieff explained that in order to bring about a result or manifestation, three things are necessary. With self-remembering and self-observation two things are present. The third one is explained by Ouspensky in his tract on Conscience: it is the non-expression of negative emotions.

<text>Thomas Alexandrovich de Hartmann (; October 3 [O.S.: September 21], 1884March 28, 1956) was a Ukrainian-born composer, pianist and professor of composition.

==Life==
De Hartmann was born on his father’s estate in Khoruzhivka, Poltava Governorate, Ukraine, Russian Empire, to Alexander Fomich de Hartmann and Olga Alexandrovna de Hartmann, née de Kross. On his father’s death, when he was nine years old, he was sent by his mother to the First Cadet Corps, the same military school his father had attended, and later the Page Corps. Upon graduation from the Page Corps, de Hartmann entered into the Russian Imperial Guard.

In the fall of 1896, at the age of 11, de Hartmann began individual lessons with Anton Arensky, and continued them until Arensky’s death in 1906. At that time, de Hartmann chose Sergei Taneyev as his new musical mentor. He took lessons on counterpoint from Taneyev, and they remained friends till Taneyev’s death. De Hartmann graduated from the Imperial Conservatory of Music, where he studied musical composition with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. His piano teacher was Anna Yesipova (the second wife and former student of Theodor Leschetizky).

In 1906, de Hartmann met Olga Arkadievna de Shumacher, daughter of Arkady Alexandrovich von Schumacher (June 7, 1855 - June 8, 1938), Head of the Debt Repayment Commission in St. Petersburg, and Olga Konstantinovna von Wulffert (1860 - April 3, 1939), who both died in Paris. They married on 25 November [O.S. 12 November] 1906. In the same year, de Hartmann began composing what would prove to be the most ambitious production of his career – &quot;La Fleurette rouge&quot;, a ballet in 5 acts and 8 scenes, of 3 hours duration. It was first performed in December, 1907, at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, produced by Nikolay Legat with Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina in the cast, and later, in 1911, at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. De Hartmann dedicated &quot;La Fleurette rouge&quot; to his wife.

It was while his ballet was being performed in repertory that de Hartmann wanted to take lessons on conducting from Felix Mottl in Munich, Germany, but as he was in military service, he was barred from travelling abroad. At that time, Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sister of Tsar Nicolas II, liked to play the violin, and de Hartmann would sometimes accompany her on the piano. When the Grand Duchess learned that de Hartmann wanted to study with Mottl, she arranged for the Tsar to meet de Hartmann, and as a result, de Hartmann was put into the military reserves, allowing him to travel abroad.

In 1908, de Hartmann went to Munich to work with Mottl, and there he met Wassily Kandinsky. At this time, de Hartmann was becoming disenchanted with traditional harmonization, and Kandinsky’s avant-garde approach to art was very attractive to him. The two collaborated on various stage works, but none was performed in their lifetimes.

While in Munich, Thomas de Hartmann met the artist, former Sufi student and later stage impresario, Alexander de Salzmann; they were both friends of Rainer Maria Rilke and Wassily Kandinsky. Later, in Russia, after the beginning of World War I, de Hartmann would introduce de Salzmann to George Gurdjieff.

From 1912 to 1914, de Hartmann divided his time between Munich and his estate in Khoruzhivka, working on various compositions and stage productions. When war was declared in 1914, de Hartmann was recalled to military service and moved to Tsarskoye Selo, where his regiment was located.

In Dec. 1916 de Hartmann met G.I. Gurdjieff, who became his spiritual teacher. De Hartmann and his wife met with Gurdjieff in St. Petersburg a few times before being assigned, in late February, 1917, to the reserve forces near the Austrian front in Ukraine. He travelled to Kiev, and his wife followed him, staying with de Hartmann’s sister who was living there. In April, 1917, de Hartmann was assigned to Masslennikov and Shmyakov, members of the State Duma, and later that month he was reassigned to travel with Rodzyanko. They all travelled to Minsk to attend the first congress of representatives of the Western Front.

In August, 1917, the Main Artillery Directorate sent de Hartmann to Rostov-on-the-Don to “speed up the production of a model of [his] system of anti-airplane machines.” (He had previously invented a kind of periscope arrangement for firing guns from the trenches without the soldiers poking their heads out to aim. It had been accepted by the army and had begun production, but it was too late to save the Russian army, and was obsolete by the time of the Second World War.)

In November, 1917, while he was travelling, he fell ill with typhoid in Sochi, and was granted leave for three months, whereupon he rejoined Gurdjieff, who had moved to Yessentuki. He was released from military service in February, 1918, and continued to stay and work with Gurdjieff, later travelling with him to Tiflis (Tbilisi). In 1919, de Hartmann was appointed Professor of Music at the Tiflis Conservatory, and during this time, he wrote music for a pair of stage productions. In 1920, the de Hartmanns travelled with Gurdjieff to Constantinople, and, from there, to Berlin in 1921, Paris in 1922, then in October, 1922, moved into the Prieuré d’Avon in Fontainebleau, south of Paris. The de Hartmanns remained there with Gurdjieff until 1929.

In June, 1929, de Hartmann broke with Gurdjieff and moved to Courbevoie with his wife’s parents. His wife continued to work with Gurdjieff, splitting her time between the Prieuré and Courbevoie, finally leaving Gurdjieff for good at the beginning of 1930. At this time, to make a living, de Hartmann arranged the orchestra music of other composers for chamber music, which could be played more cheaply on the radio, and he wrote music for films.

Having established an income from the royalties of his arrangements and film music, the de Hartmanns lived first in Courbevoie, then in Garches, south of Paris until 1950. De Hartmann had his orchestral music conducted by such conductors as Bigot, Stokowski, and others, and his Concertos and Sonatas were played by such soloists as Casals, Tortelier, Rampal, and Alèz.

In 1950, at the request of Jeanne de Salzmann after Gurdjieff’s death, the de Hartmanns moved to the United States to support the Gurdjieff work there, first joining Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin, then moving to New York. De Hartmann, who had become well-known in Europe, had to start again from the beginning in the new world to build up his reputation. As he said in a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright, “…to be played on the radio – it is necessary to be famous. In order to be famous, it is necessary to be played on the radio.” He was hampered by ill health, and spent much of his time working on publications of the Gurdjieff/de Hartmann music.

De Hartmann suffered a heart attack in 1954, and was ill for some time. He gradually recovered, and his last year was very productive – he was working on his Fourth Symphony and preparing to play for a recital of his works in New York, when he suffered a fatal heart attack on 28 March 1956. After his death, his wife continued to promote his music until her death at her home near Nambé, Santa Fe County, New Mexico. Both she and her husband are buried in the Princeton Cemetery, Princeton, New Jersey.

==Association with Anton Arensky==
De Hartmann first met Anton Stepanovich Arensky in the fall of 1896. One Sunday, when he was visiting his aunt, who was a friend of Arensky’s mother and sister, she took him to Arensky’s house so that he could hear de Hartmann play piano. Arensky gave him a theme on which to improvise, and having heard the result, accepted de Hartmann as his only pupil. De Hartmann finished the Conservatory course under Arensky’s tutelage, learning harmony, strict style, fugue and free composition.

He remained Arensky’s pupil until Arensky’s death in 1906. Arensky’s influence on de Hartmann might best be summarized by a statement of Taneyev’s. One day, when de Hartmann visited Taneyev with part of his ballet &quot;La Fleurette rouge&quot;, Taneyev asked de Hartmann to play it on the piano, while he and other guests who were there listened. At the end, Taneyev said: “Your harmony can be compared only with Arensky’s harmony. This is the highest compliment that I can give you.”

==Association with Sergei Taneyev==
De Hartmann first met Sergei Ivanovich Taneyev at Arensky’s house when he was still at the conservatory. He had with him some exercises in harmony from the conservatory, and Taneyev sat at the piano and analyzed them, along with Modest Tchaikovsky and Felix Blumenfeld who were also there visiting Arensky. After this, de Hartmann did not see Taneyev for several years.

De Hartmann renewed his acquaintance with Taneyev when Arensky was unwell and living in Finland. In the fall of 1905, de Hartmann had finished the orchestration of one act of the ballet and wanted feedback about it. He decided to drop in on Taneyev to show him the ballet. Taneyev very cordially received his friend’s pupil.

After Arensky’s death in 1906, de Hartmann dropped in on Taneyev on the way to his estate, and de Hartmann invited him to come to stay at his estate in Ukraine during the summer. Taneyev visited that year and the next, Taneyev instructing de Hartmann in counterpoint and fugue during this time.

Taneyev was de Hartmann’s mentor during his years of doubt, when he felt that traditional music was at a dead end, and he wanted to find a new path. As de Hartmann wrote in his memoir about Taneyev: “I had passed Strict Style and Forms with Arensky, but I also wished to study Fugue with Taneyev. At that time, it had already started to slowly become clear to me that the time has come to look for new ways in music. Neither then or now did I stop liking the composers, particularly the Russian ones, which I had already liked as a boy. Of course, I particularly liked my teacher Arensky, The Five [Mily Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin], Glazunov, Rachmaninov and others, and I still do. But it is one thing to like them. The other was my own composition. Here it was necessary to search for something new. And so, before this search I wished to know all the previous techniques. That was the time when questions were still alive. So I began to work with Taneyev on the fugue.”

Taneyev encouraged de Hartmann to continue his composing, to work on large compositions: “First of all I wish to chastise you for not composing anything. It seems to me that you attach more significance to exercises in counterpoint than you should. More than anyone else I am inclined to recognize their usefulness. But I find that they should be written in the intervals between composing, and in any case composing must be in the forefront. It is not sufficient to develop technique in one direction – its all-rounded development is possible only in practice. Even if some compositions in the beginning turn out to be unsatisfactory. It is possible to avoid these or those deficiencies in the compositions which follow. But one should not limit oneself to “daydreams about opera or ballet.” You need to compose in large formats – sonatas and so on. Start a symphony, an overture – something of that kind. It is difficult to find better conditions for this than those you have in Khoruzhevka. When large things will have been written by you, then it can be easy to answer your question about the level of your technical skills. If there are some deficiencies in this connection, they will not be difficult to correct and in this case some technical exercises can definitely be of great use. They can be compared to technical piano exercises, which promote the development of technique and are necessary also for the finished virtuosos. But the one, who, besides these exercises, would play nothing further on the piano and for several years would not learn even one piece, would perhaps completely forget how to play. In the end, you also could lose the habit of composing. It seems to me that composition must be your chief occupation, which everything else obeys. And then both exercises in counterpoint and work with Mottl take on a definite purpose and contribute to one main goal. Otherwise all this is, if not completely aimless, then barely attaining those goals which are hardly worth pursuing – in rehearsing operas with singers, the very best that can be attained is to become a good concertmaster. And so, Thomas Alexandrovich, before everything it is necessary to compose, tirelessly and continually, and to evaluate everything else only from this point of view – in so far as it assists or hinders this goal.”

In Munich in 1908, Taneyev met with Kandinsky and his fellow painters, and later he wrote to de Hartmann in a letter: “It was very nice to learn that my quartet pleased Mr. Kandinsky, and on my next trip to Munich I will try to become acquainted with those decadent pictures which will be painted under the influence of my music.” Taneyev and de Hartmann remained in close touch up to the time of Taneyev’s death in 1915.

==Association with Wassily Kandinsky==
In 1908, de Hartmann went to Munich to work on conducting with Felix Mottl, and there he met Wassily Kandinsky. At that time, de Hartmann was beginning to feel the need to go on a new music path. When he visited Kandinsky’s studio for the first time, he was very much taken by the movement of the colours in the woodcuts he was shown, despite the static nature of the medium. Kandinsky showed de Hartmann that traditional forms were not necessary to express one’s inner intention. As de Hartmann wrote in 1912 in &quot;The Blaue Reiter Almanac&quot;: “In all the arts, and especially in music, every method that arises from an inner necessity is right. The composer wants to express what at the moment is the intention of his intuition. At this moment he might feel the need for a combination of sounds, which, according to present theory, is regarded as cacophonous. It is obvious that such a judgement of theory cannot be considered an obstacle in this case. The artist is compelled to use such a combination because its use was determined by his inner voice: the correspondence of the means of expression with inner necessity is the essence of beauty in a work.”

Kandinsky and de Hartmann were joined by Alexander Sacharoff, a young and talented dancer. They began working on a stage production based on “Daphnis and Chloe”, but when they realized that Fokine and Diaghilev were working with the same theme, they dropped this project. However, Sacharoff continued his study of ancient Greek dancing from his studies of images on pottery in museums, and in 1910 he presented his interpretations to chamber music by de Hartmann in the Tonhalle in Munich. These solo dance presentations continued into 1911.

Kandinsky and de Hartmann continued their collaboration on a stage production called “The Yellow Sound.” Its scenario was published in &quot;The Blaue Reiter Almanac,&quot; and sketches of the music were made, but war intervened and the production was never completed in their lifetime. In 1982, the Guggenheim Foundation premiere of Kandinsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Der gelbe Klang&quot; was made possible thanks to a complete rearrangement by Gunther Schuller of de Hartmann&#x27;s hitherto lost work. From this composition, which very freely adapted the sketches that de Hartmann wrote, it is clear why Konstantin Stanislavski could not understand the work when de Hartmann proposed it for the Moscow Art Theatre in 1914.

Kandinsky and de Hartmann reunited in Paris in the 1930’s, but never again collaborated on a project. Kandinsky died in 1944. De Hartmann wrote in his memoir: “I will finish my recollection of Kandinsky with the scene when I saw him for the last time, two days before his death. His wife had asked me to cheer him up, and had left the room. I was alone before Kandinsky, who was dying. He smiled at me, then went to sleep. I looked at him and at his pictures which hung on the wall, pictures he loved most. One was from the period of his first large ‘Compositions,’ the period of some imaginary catastrophes and destructions corresponding to that level which in Hindu philosophy is called the plane of suffering. They were painted during the years when no one could imagine that such catastrophes could take place, that here, on the so-called physical plane, there would be such disasters, wars and revolutions. Some people would not pay attention, but others would see in these pictures a sort of foretelling. And then I looked at another picture, one from his last period – unearthly blue space, in it, correct geometrical figures, and over the whole reigned peace, harmony, a kind of wonderful oneness in multiplicity. A quite different, very high spiritual world. In Hindu philosophy, the enlightened world of high Reason. Perhaps here also my friend Kandinsky had foreseen the coming of a spiritual awakening, when the inner sound will be heard by everyone.”

==Association with G.I. Gurdjieff==
From the time of his early days in Khoruzhevka, de Hartmann was interested in the Kabbalah. As he wrote in a memoir of his youth: &quot;My interest in Jewry began when, still in my youth, in my philosophical searches I stumbled across Hermeticism in connection with Bereshit and the philosophy of the Kabbalah. From the very first pages of the original of the Kabbalah I paid attention to its depth, and also to the ideological similarity of Ein Sof with Brahma. Further I became interested in Hasidism, its loving attitude to the suffering of the Jewish poor, with its healers so close in spirit to our Elders.&quot;

This philosophical interest would have been supported in his association with Taneyev and Kandinsky. As de Hartmann wrote in one of his memoirs: “As I learned later, in Taneyev’s library were also the Upanishads and Sutras, and other books connected with the field of Hindu Philosophy. He knew Schopenhauer and was a great admirer of Spinoza. He had made a graphic design, picturing the scheme of the logical construction of the principals expounded in Spinoza’s Ethics.” Undoubtedly there would have been conversations about these subjects during Taneyev’s stays with de Hartmann and his wife in Khoruzhevka.

After Taneyev’s death, de Hartmann continued his search for spiritual guidance, and in December, 1916, he met Georgi Ivanovich Gurdjieff in St. Petersburg. Over the next few months, Thomas and Olga de Hartmann had some opportunities to meet with Gurdjieff, and he became a big spiritual influence on them. But de Hartmann was in the army, and the war intervened. Olga de Hartmann recounts a meeting with Gurdjieff: “I told him that my husband had to go to the front and that neither of us would remain in the city much longer, as I wanted to follow my husband as far as I would be allowed to go. I also asked whether it was not possible for my husband to avoid going to the front. ‘No,’ he said, ‘when you live among wolves, you have to howl like a wolf; but you should not be taken over by the psychosis of war, and inside you should try to be far removed from all this.’”

During the time that de Hartmann was at the front, Gurdjieff travelled to the Caucasus, where the de Hartmanns were able to rejoin him in August, 1917, in Yessentuki. In the Caucasus, de Hartmann was exposed to the music of Komitas, who at that time was virtually unknown in his own country, and to genuine Eastern music ensembles. Though de Hartmann wrote music with Eastern themes in his ballet La Fleurette rouge, this was a revelation. As de Hartmann wrote: “… Mr. Gurdjieff gave us another opportunity of listening to real Eastern music and musicians, so that I could better understand how he wished his own music to be written and interpreted.”

Gurdjieff intensified work on his ballet The Struggle of the Magicians, and fragments of music for it were composed. This ballet was conceived of as far back as 1915 in Russia, but now with a composer available, Gurdjieff began to plot dances and scenes for this ballet. Though the libretto of the ballet was written, and music in various stages of composition exists, this ballet was never completed.

After the de Hartmanns followed Gurdjieff to France, settling first in Paris, then at the Prieuré des Basses-Loges in Fontainebleau-Avon, work continued on these dances, but in a new direction – a demonstration of them, now called Sacred Dances and Exercises, was planned for the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris in December of 1923, followed by demonstrations in New York, Boston and Chicago in the United States in 1924. During this time, de Hartmann transcribed and co-wrote much of the music that Gurdjieff collected and used for his movements exercises. For these dances, some of the old music was used, but more had to be composed and everything had to be orchestrated.

After returning to the Prieuré, Gurdjieff was involved in a serious car accident. After his recovery, the direction of his work changed, and he began working with de Hartmann on a new direction of music. This music consists of generally short pieces of piano music, often consisting of a melody in the right hand and a rhythmic harmonization in the left, though there are many exceptions to this. One of the aphorisms in Gurdjieff’s work is: “Take the understanding of the East with the knowledge of the West – and then seek.” The same might be said of this music – it is a combination of Eastern type melodies and themes brought by Gurdjieff, worked on with the Western knowledge of Thomas de Hartmann. The resulting pieces are quite unique in de Hartmann’s music life.

Gurdjieff and de Hartmann worked on this music from 1925 to 1927, but the need to earn money to help support the Prieuré led de Hartmann to work first on arrangements of the works of other composers, and then for scores for film music. As a result of this, his musical work with Gurdjieff came to an end. He left Gurdjieff in 1929. Some of this music was later adapted by Laurence Rosenthal for the 1979 Peter Brook film &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;.

==Music==
In Thomas de Hartmann’s earliest works, one can see the Russian Romanticism of Arensky and Taneyev. By 1908, Kandinsky’s Impressionism and Modernism are seen. From 1916 to 1929, Gurdjieff led him to study the music of the East. Starting in 1929, his work on film music led him to add world music, bitonality, jazz and ultra-modernism to his compositions. Thus, de Hartmann became a poly-stylist. He would, in a single work, use a rich combination of techniques, both compositional and expressive, to convey what he wished to say. Other influences on his works include the Russian fairy tales he had heard from childhood, which often tell the story of a quest. His ballet &quot;La Fleurette Rouge&quot; is based on one such fairy tale, written in this early Russian Romantic style, while his &quot;Twelve Russian Fairy Tales&quot; were written in his more mature style of the 1930s. De Hartmann was also influenced by poetry and other writings, and many of his pieces are based on poems or writings by prominent authors such as Shelley, Pushkin, Verlaine, Joyce and others. Shapes and colours, which Kandinsky believed had specific meanings, were also inspirations for his works. His &quot;Yellow Sound&quot; and &quot;Lumière noire&quot; communicate contrasting colours, and his &quot;Fête de la Patronne&quot; is based on a painting by Degas.

His compositional output can be summarized thus: 18 orchestral works, 15 chamber music works, music for 14 stage works, 20+ collections of piano works, 40+ song cycles, 4 volumes of music in collaboration with G.I. Gurdjieff, 50+ works for film, 12 arrangements of works by other composers.

<text>The Gurdjieff movements are a series of sacred dances that were collected or authored by G. I. Gurdjieff. He taught his students as part of the work of &quot;self observation&quot; and &quot;self study&quot;.

== Significance ==
Gurdjieff taught that the movements were not merely calisthenics, exercises in concentration, and displays of bodily coordination and aesthetic sensibility. Instead, the movements expressed knowledge that had been passed from generation to generation of initiates, each posture and gesture helping the participant to become more aware of themselves in movement.

== Origins ==
The movements are purportedly based upon traditional dances that Gurdjieff studied as he traveled throughout central Asia, India, Tibet, and Africa where he encountered various Indo-European and Sufi orders, Buddhist centers and other sources of traditional culture and learning. However, Gurdjieff insists that the main source, as well as the unique symbol of the Enneagram, was transmitted to him as an initiate in the Sarmoung Monastery. Gurdjieff collected and taught thousands of movements throughout his teaching career. According to estimates, about 40 authentic choreographies were preserved by his students. The music for the movements was written by Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann in the 1920s and are practiced by various groups of Gurdjieff followers around the world.

== In media ==
A brief glimpse of the dances appears at the very end of the motion picture about Gurdjieff, &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;, produced and directed in 1978 by Peter Brook.

<text>USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; (CVA-59) (later CV-59, then AVT-59), was a supercarrier named after the first United States Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Commissioned in 1955, she was the United States&#x27; first completed supercarrier, and was the lead ship of her class. The other carriers of her class were , and . She surpassed the World War II Japanese carrier as the largest carrier yet built, and was the first designed to support jet aircraft.

The ship was affectionately called &quot;The FID&quot;, because her namesake was the first Secretary of Defense, FID standing for &quot;First In Defense&quot;. This is also the slogan on the ship&#x27;s insignia and patch. 

&quot;Forrestal&quot; served for nearly four decades in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific. She was decommissioned in 1993, and made available as a museum. Attempts to save her were unsuccessful, and in February 2014 she was towed to Brownsville, Texas, to be scrapped. Scrapping was completed in December 2015.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Forrestal&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down at Newport News Shipbuilding on 14 July 1952. During construction, her design was adjusted several times—the original telescoping bridge, a design left over from the canceled USS &quot;United States&quot;, was replaced by a conventional island structure, and her flight deck was modified to include an angled landing deck and steam catapults, drawing on British innovations. She was launched on 11 December 1954, and commissioned into service on 1 October 1955, with Captain Roy L. Johnson in command.

==Design features==
&quot;Forrestal&quot; was the first American aircraft carrier to be constructed with an angled flight deck, steam catapult, and an optical landing system, as opposed to having them installed after launching.

The original design——provided for the island to retract flush with the deck during flight operations, but that was found to be too complicated. Another solution was considered where the two masts were to fold down, in lieu of the retractable island, to allow the carrier to pass under the Brooklyn Bridge. The larger center mast was to fold to the side and rest on the flight deck, and the smaller mast was to fold toward the stern.

==1956–1962==
From her home port, Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Forrestal&quot; spent the first year of service in intensive training operations off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean. In May of 1956, Captain Johnson was relieved by Captain William Edward Ellis. An important assignment was training aviators in the use of her advanced facilities. During this time she often operated out of Naval Station Mayport, Florida. On 7 November 1956, she put to sea from Mayport to operate in the eastern Atlantic during the Suez Crisis, ready to enter the Mediterranean Sea should it be necessary. She returned to Norfolk on 12 December to prepare for her first deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean, for which she sailed on 15 January 1957.

On this, as on her succeeding tours of duty in the Mediterranean, &quot;Forrestal&quot; visited many ports to &quot;show the flag&quot; and take on board dignitaries and the general public. For military observers, she staged underway demonstrations to illustrate her capacity to bring air power to and from the sea in military operations on any scale. She returned to Norfolk on 22 July 1957 for exercises off the North Carolina coast in preparation for her first NATO operation, Operation Strikeback in the North Sea. This deployment, between 3 September and 22 October, found her visiting Southampton, UK, as well as drilling in the highly important task of coordinating United States naval power with that of other NATO nations.

The next year found &quot;Forrestal&quot; participating in a series of major fleet exercises as well as taking part in experimental flight operations. During the Lebanon crisis of 1958, the carrier was again called upon to operate in the eastern Atlantic to back up naval operations in the Mediterranean. She sailed from Norfolk on 11 July to embark an air group at Mayport two days later, then patrolled the Atlantic until returning to Norfolk on 17 July.
On her second tour of duty in the Mediterranean, from 2 September 1958 to 12 March 1959, &quot;Forrestal&quot; again combined a program of training, patrol, and participation in major exercises with ceremonial, hospitality and public visiting. Her guest list during this cruise was headed by United States Secretary of Defense N. H. McElroy. Returning to Norfolk, she continued the never-ending task of training new aviators, constantly maintaining her readiness for instant reaction to any demand for her services brought on by international events. Visitors during the year included King Hussein of Jordan.

&quot;Forrestal&quot; again went to the 6th Fleet between 28 January 1960 and 31 August, visiting the ports typical of a Mediterranean deployment as well as Split, Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia). Again she was open for visitors at many ports, as well as taking part in the patrol and training schedule of the 6th Fleet. She completed another deployment to 6th Fleet January 1961 to August 1961, after which she entered a yard period at Norfolk Naval Shipyard where the six arresting wires were replaced with four, freed 03 level spaces were converted to berthing areas, and the right side flight deck mirror landing system was replaced with a permanent Fresnel lens in the port catwalk, among other updates. She conducted a shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay in January 1962 with port calls in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Port of Spain, Trinidad. She then acted as the defending carrier in an amphibious force landing exercise on Vieques Island; it was the largest assembled naval force since the Korean War. &quot;Forrestal&quot; with Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; with President John F. Kennedy aboard hosted many foreign ambassadors, military attaches, and other diplomats for a Naval Air Power demonstration off the Virginia Capes in June 1962, with Captain Donald M. White then in command.

&quot;Forrestal&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean again on 3 August 1962 to 2 March 1963 as flagship for Commander Carrier Division Four (ComCarDiv 4) participating in NATO exercises in the Atlantic and western Mediterranean with , British and French carriers. Cross deck operations were conducted with . Whilst a USMC Phantom was aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, it developed problems and couldn&#x27;t take off to return to the &quot;Forrestal&quot; before docking in Malta. US personnel were not allowed on Malta at the time so the Phantom was painted with Royal Navy tail markings to make the jet blend in with Royal Navy Phantoms.

==1963–1967==
&quot;Forrestal&quot;, under the command of Captain Dick H. Guinn, made history in November 1963, on the 8th, 21st and 22nd, when LT James H. Flatley III and his crew made 21 full-stop landings and takeoffs in a C-130 Hercules aboard the ship. The tests were conducted out in the North Atlantic off the coast of Massachusetts. In so doing, &quot;Forrestal&quot; and the C-130 set a record for the largest and heaviest airplane landing on a Navy aircraft carrier. The Navy was trying to determine whether the big Hercules could serve as a &quot;Super-COD&quot;, or &quot;Carrier Onboard Delivery&quot; aircraft. The problem was there was no aircraft which could replenish a carrier in mid-ocean. The Hercules was stable and reliable, and had a long cruising range and high payload.

The tests were more than successful. At , the KC-130F came to a complete stop within , and at the maximum load, the plane used only for take-off. The Navy concluded that, with the C-130 Hercules, it would be possible to lift of cargo and land it on a carrier. However, the idea was considered too risky for routine COD operations. The aircraft was also too large to fit on the carrier&#x27;s elevators or in her hangars, severely hampering operations. The C-2 Greyhound program was developed and the first of these planes became operational in 1965. For his effort, the Navy awarded LT Flatley the Distinguished Flying Cross. The Hercules used, BuNo 149798, was retired to the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in May 2003.

In 1964, in what was known as Operation Brother Sam, U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson sent &quot;Forrestal&quot; to support the military coup d&#x27;état against Brazilian president João Goulart. The coup was successful and led to a 20-year-long military dictatorship in Brazil.

On 15 March 1966, Forrestal again was a witness to history when she and various other units of the Sixth Fleet made a brief stopover at Palomares, Spain, (site of an underway nuclear disaster cleanup and H-bomb recovery effort) ostensibly to deliver personnel, material support, or both. The carrier dropped anchor at 0903, departed at 1219, and resumed flight operations.

==1967 fire==

In June 1967, &quot;Forrestal&quot;, under the command of Captain John Kingsman Beling, departed Norfolk for duty in waters off Vietnam. Once in the Gulf of Tonkin, &quot;Forrestal&quot; began four days of sorties. The planes of Attack Carrier Air Wing 17 flew about 150 missions against targets in North Vietnam from the ship. On 29 July 1967, during preparation for another strike, a Zuni rocket installed on an F-4 Phantom (#110), misfired, impacting an armed A-4 Skyhawk (#405)&#x27;s side, parked on the port side. The rocket&#x27;s impact dislodged and ruptured the Skyhawk&#x27;s external fuel tank. Fuel from the leaking tank caught fire, creating a serious conflagration that burned for hours, killing 134, injuring 161, destroying 21 aircraft and costing the Navy US$72 million. On the flight deck that day was Lieutenant Commander (later Senator) John McCain, who was wounded by an exploding bomb. In September of 1967, Captain Beling was relieved by Captain Robert B. Baldwin, who in turn was relieved in December 1968 by Captain James W. Nance.

==1968–1975==
&quot;Forrestal&quot; was deployed to Mediterranean waters four times between 1968 and 1973. She also sped to Tunisia for rescue operations in the flooded Medjerda River Valley near Tunis. The ship logged three more Mediterranean deployments between 1973 and 1975. On 22 July 1974, as a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Roger Davies requested the evacuation of U.S. citizens from that island nation. In a joint Navy-Marine Corps effort, HMM-162 from the 6th Fleet amphibious assault ship evacuated 466 people, 384 of them U.S. citizens, in only five hours. &quot;Forrestal&quot; provided air cover for that operation.

In October 1968, during the night recovery of a VAW-123 E-2A, the aircraft boltered and went off the angled deck and into the water, nose first. When it hit the water, the aircraft flipped over onto its back, breaking its radar dome off and sank within minutes. The dome floated and was recovered. Immediately, helicopters moved into the area for search and rescue operations, three crewmen were recovered, while three were lost at sea.

On 10 July 1972, while moored at Pier 12, Norfolk, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was once again the scene of a catastrophic fire. This fire, which was set by a crewmember, was in an O-3 level computer room (just under the flight deck). A hole was cut in the flight deck to reach the fire from above and hundreds of gallons of water were pumped into the space. This ruined all of the computer equipment and the ship took on an exaggerated list, prompting concern that she might capsize. The ship returned to the yards at Portsmouth and three months later was at last able to relieve , which had to serve an extended Mediterranean deployment while the &quot;Forrestal&quot; was being repaired. Electrician&#x27;s Mate Robert Horan, who was aboard at the time, recalls in a memoir &quot;[The fire did] over seven million dollars in damage. The news videos...show[ed] the flight deck glowing red. We went back to Portsmouth for repairs and I believe we got most of the CIC and electronics equipment that was supposed to go on board the , then under construction.&quot;

In June 1974, &quot;Forrestal&quot; sent a contingent of 34 sailors and two officers to represent the U.S. Navy at the 30th anniversary of D-Day at Normandy, France. The group marched in various parades at the Normandy Beaches on 6 June 1974 as well as Cherbourg, France and was well received by the locals. The group was passed in review by retired General of the Army Omar Bradley. This contingent of sailors were flown off of &quot;Forrestal&quot; by SH-3 Sea Kings of HELANTISUBRON 3 (HS-3) onto the deck of USS &quot;Milwaukee&quot; (AOR-2), then taken to Naval Station Rota, Spain. After a few days of refresher &quot;marching&quot;, they were flown to Cherbourg, France in a C-130. Following the celebrations, the group reunited with &quot;Forrestal&quot; at the island of Crete in mid June.

==1975–1980==
On 30 June 1975, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was reclassified a &quot;Multi-purpose Aircraft Carrier&quot;, CV-59. Also in 1975 &quot;Forrestal&quot; was selected to be host ship for the International Naval Review in New York City on the nation&#x27;s Bicentennial. On 4 July 1976, on &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s flight deck, President Gerald Ford rang in the Bicentennial and reviewed over 40 tall ships from countries around the world.

Shortly after the review, &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in a special shock test. It involved the detonation of high explosives near the hull to determine if a capital ship could withstand the strain of close quarter combat and still remain operational.

In September 1977, following a nine-month overhaul, &quot;Forrestal&quot; departed Norfolk and shifted her homeport to Mayport. The carrier left Mayport on Friday, 13 January 1978 for a three-week at-sea period in the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) of the Roosevelt Roads Operating Area to complete the third phase of Type Commander&#x27;s Training (TYT-3), and to undergo the Operational Readiness Evaluation (ORE). On the evening of 15 January 1978 as an A-7 Corsair II from VA-81 crashed on the flight deck, killing two deck crewmen and injuring 10 others. The pilot was operating without communication gear due to an onboard malfunction, and as he was making his approach, he saw that the &quot;ball&quot; was lit (signalling that it was permissible to land). The pilot ejected safely after seeing that the deck was covered with parked and moving aircraft, by which time it was impossible to pull up. He was recovered, suffering only minor injuries, but his Corsair struck another A-7 and an EA-6B before careening across the deck in a ball of flames. A small fire on the aft portion of the deck, caused by fuel spilled during the crash, was extinguished within seconds. At the time of the accident, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was operating about off St. Augustine, Florida. A memorial service for the dead was held on board on 19 January. The ship returned to Mayport on 3 February.

&quot;Forrestal&quot; left Mayport for the Mediterranean on 4 April 1978. At 22:00 on 8 April, just minutes after the ship had finished a general quarters drill, the crew was called to G.Q. again, but this time it was not a drill; a fire had broken out in the Number Three Main Machinery Room. Freshly painted thermal insulation in Three Main engine room had been set smoldering by hot steam lines. Watch-standers within the space activated an extinguishing system and had the fire out within seconds.

Three days later, the crew again was called to respond to another emergency G.Q. At midnight on 11 April, a fire was discovered in a catapult steam trunk in the forward part of the ship at about the 01 level, and another fire was found in an adjoining storeroom minutes later. The at-sea fire brigade, working with area repair lockers, had the fires out within the hour.

On 10 May 1978 while in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, flooding, which began in a pump room in the aft portion of the ship, rose to a height of before it was controlled. The flood spread into food storage rooms, destroying most of the ship&#x27;s stocks of fresh milk and produce. Divers from the ship&#x27;s Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team dropped into the pump room to plug the leak. Total damage from the flooding was estimated at $30,000.

From 19 to 29 May 1978, &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in Operation Dawn Patrol, the first of three NATO exercises the ship would be involved in during the deployment. Dawn Patrol involved air and ground forces and over 80 ships from six NATO countries. &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s role during the exercise included protecting a Turkish amphibious task group and working with and the French aircraft carrier &quot;Foch&quot; to defend against simulated &quot;enemy&quot; ships and aircraft.

During this sea period, two separate air crashes on successive days left one pilot dead and another injured. On 24 June 1978, LCDR T. P. Anderson, Operations Officer for Carrier Air Wing Seventeen, was killed when his A-7E Corsair II crashed into the sea during a practice bombing mission. Before the crash, the pilot ejected while the plane was inverted in less than ideal weather conditions. On 25 June, a pilot from VA-83, also flying an A-7E, ejected shortly after takeoff due to a catapult malfunction, suffering minor injuries. He could be seen swimming away from the side of the ship as it passed near him. A rescue crew aboard an SH-3D Sea King helicopter from HS-3 recovered the pilot and returned to the ship within eight minutes after the crash. Both accidents occurred as the ship was operating in the Ionian Sea, east of Sicily.

From 4 to 19 September 1978, &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in the massive NATO exercise Northern Wedding, which included over 40,000 men, 22 submarines, and 800 rotary and fixed-wing aircraft from nine NATO countries. Northern Wedding, which took place every four years, practiced NATO&#x27;s ability to reinforce and resupply Europe in times of tension or war. During the exercise &quot;Forrestal&quot; and the British aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; headed separate task groups, steaming in a two-carrier formation to gain sea control and deploying their aircraft in support of mock amphibious landings in the Shetland Islands and Jutland, Denmark.

From 28 September to 10 October, &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in Display Determination, the third and final NATO exercise of the deployment. The operation, involving ships, aircraft, and personnel from eight NATO countries, was designed to practice rapid reinforcement and resupply of the southern European region in times of tension or war. &quot;Forrestal&quot; arrived in Rota, Spain, on 11 October for the last overseas port stop of the deployment.

On 13 October 1978, the ship put to sea to conduct a one-day exercise with a task group of deploying U.S. ships headed by the aircraft carrier . Air Wing Seventeen&#x27;s planes conducted mock attacks on the task group to allow the ships to practice anti-air warfare. &quot;Forrestal&quot; returned to Rota late in the evening on the 13th.

Before dawn on 15 October, &quot;Forrestal&quot; departed Rota and outchopped from the Sixth Fleet, having been relieved by &quot;Saratoga&quot;. On the homeward transit, &quot;Forrestal&quot; took an extreme northerly course as part of a special operation code-named Windbreak. Commander Second Fleet, Vice Adm. Wesley L. McDonald, embarked in &quot;Forrestal&quot; for the exercise. Windbreak was designed to introduce U.S. sailors and equipment to relatively unfamiliar waters and conditions, and to gauge Soviet interest in U.S. ships in transit to and from the Mediterranean. During the exercise, &quot;Forrestal&quot; traveled as far north as 62 degrees latitude, south of Iceland, encountering seas to , winds in excess of , and a wind chill factor that drove the temperature as far down as . The waves were high enough to crash over the flight deck as the ship drove west. Also participating in Windbreak were the guided missile cruiser and the destroyer .

&quot;Forrestal&quot; returned to Mayport on 26 October 1978. On 13 November, &quot;Forrestal&quot; commenced a four-month period of upkeep and repair known as an Extended Selected Restricted Availability (ESRA), to be conducted as the ship was moored alongside the carrier pier in Mayport. &quot;Forrestal&quot; ended 1978 as she had started it, moored to the carrier pier in Mayport.

On 27 August 1979 &quot;Forrestal&quot; had to make an emergency deployment due to Hurricane David. It was feared the ship could be damaged and in turn damage the carrier pier as the storm surge from the hurricane thrust inland. &quot;Forrestal&quot; traveled through the main part of the storm and emerged in the eye briefly before coming out of the opposite side as the storm moved northwest along the east coast. The ship was manned with a skeleton crew and no aircraft.

After completing her 15th Mediterranean cruise from November 1979 to May 1980 she celebrated her silver anniversary in October 1980. &quot;Forrestal&quot; got underway on her 16th Mediterranean deployment in March 1981 and returned to the carrier pier in Mayport on 15 September 1981 .

==1981–1987==
On 2 March 1981, &quot;Forrestal&quot; began her 16th Mediterranean deployment and second quarter century of naval service. During the Syria/Israel missile crisis, &quot;Forrestal&quot; maintained a high state of readiness for 53 consecutive days at sea. In a Gulf of Sidra exercise, two Libyan aircraft were shot down after firing on F-14s from &quot;Nimitz&quot; over international waters. &quot;Forrestal&quot; aircraft made more than 60% of all the intercepts of Libyan planes. After departing the Mediterranean she operated above the Arctic Circle as part of NATO Ocean Venture &#x27;81.

After a repair period, &quot;Forrestal&quot; deployed for her 18th Mediterranean cruise on 8 June 1982, and operated in the eastern Mediterranean in support of the Lebanon Contingency Force of 800 U.S. Marines in Beirut. On 12 September 1982, after transiting the Suez Canal for the first time in her 28-year history, she entered the Indian Ocean. This marked the first time that &quot;Forrestal&quot; had operated with 7th Fleet since the 1967 Vietnam cruise.

&quot;Forrestal&quot; completed the five and one-half-month deployment with a nighttime arrival at Mayport on 16 November 1982 and immediately began preparing for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The ship shifted homeport to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia on 18 January 1983, and embarked on the 28-month, $550 million SLEP, designed to extend the life of U.S. aircraft carriers another 15 to 20 years.

During &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s SLEP, the ship was completely emptied and most major equipment was removed for rework or replacement. &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s successful SLEP period was completed on time when the ship left Philadelphia on 20 May 1985. After completing a four-day transit to her homeport of Mayport, &quot;Forrestal&quot; immediately began a workup cycle in preparation for her first deployment in over four years.

&quot;Forrestal&quot; departed Mayport on 2 June 1986, on her 19th deployment. During this cruise, &quot;Forrestal&quot; aircraft frequently operated in the international airspace of the Tripoli Flight region, the international air traffic control sector of Libya. &quot;Forrestal&quot; also participated in Operation Sea Wind a joint U.S.-Egyptian training exercise and Display Determination, which featured low-level coordinated strikes and air combat maneuvering training over Turkey.

In 1987, &quot;Forrestal&quot; went through yet another period of pre-deployment workups. This included refresher training, carrier qualifications, and a six-week deployment to the North Atlantic to participate in Ocean Safari &#x27;87. In this exercise, &quot;Forrestal&quot; operated with NATO forces in the fjords of Norway.

===&quot;Forrestal&quot; in New Orleans===

The ship and crew performed so well in Ocean Safari &#x27;87 that &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s commanding officer, CAPT John A. Pieno Jr., recommended that the ship be granted a special liberty call in the United States as a reward. Special liberty calls serve to reward Navy personnel with a trip to other parts of the U.S. and provides Americans who would normally never see warships and planes an up close look at life in the United States Navy. CAPT Pieno being a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, decided that New Orleans, during her Mardi Gras celebration, would be the perfect location to show off his pride and joy. During her trip to New Orleans &quot;Forrestal&quot; broke another record by becoming the largest naval warship ever to come up the Mississippi River. Also during her four days in New Orleans she accommodated tours for over 40,000 visitors. The tour included viewings and descriptions of all her aircraft, damage control demonstrations, and the crowd&#x27;s favorite, a ride on one of her four aircraft elevators.

==1988–1993==
&quot;Forrestal&quot; departed on her 20th major deployment on 25 April 1988. She steamed directly to the North Arabian Sea via the Suez Canal in support of America&#x27;s Earnest Will operations in the region. She spent 108 consecutive days at sea before her first liberty port. During the five and one-half month deployment, &quot;Forrestal&quot; operated in three ocean areas and spent only 15 days in port. She returned on 7 October 1988, and received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her superior operational performance during the deployment.

After a brief stand down period followed by local operations, &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in New York City&#x27;s Fleet Week in May 1989, and then commenced preparations for her next deployment. Also in 1989, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.
&quot;Forrestal&quot;″s departure for her 21st major deployment was delayed when a fire caused major damage to a primary command and control trunk space. Through the efforts of the ship&#x27;s crew and civilian contractors, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was able to depart for her deployment on 6 November 1989, completing the necessary repairs well ahead of projections. The 9 October 1989 fire caused around $2.5 million in damage and injured 11 sailors.

The final two months of 1989 proved exciting. Beyond the &quot;routine&quot; exercises and training initiatives, &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s crew became part of history, as they provided support to President George H. W. Bush during his Malta Summit. The support included a three-hour Presidential visit to the ship. &quot;Forrestal&quot; participated in numerous exercises during this deployment including Harmonie Sud, Tunisian Amphibious and National Week. She returned to Mayport on 12 April 1990, ending a deployment which had included nine port visits in seven different countries. After a post deployment stand down, &quot;Forrestal&quot; completed a drydocking selected restricted availability at Mayport from 14 May 1990 – 27 August 1990.

From September to November 1990, &quot;Forrestal&quot; underwent repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Repairs included work on the catapult system, hull and other changes to accommodate the F/A-18 Hornet. &quot;Forrestal&quot; returned to Mayport 21 November 1990.

In 1989, during work up cruises to prepare for the upcoming deployment, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was diverted from an 11-day carrier task force training exercise in the Atlantic. The order came in just after midnight and the &quot;Forrestal&quot; was directed to leave the task force, and proceed West at flank speed. After 20 hours, she slowed to 2 knots and took up station keeping off the North West coast of Puerto Rico. At around 12:30 the second evening, 2 helicopters arrived, delivering SEAL Team Six to the &quot;Forrestal&quot;&#x27;s deck. The crew and its &quot;visitors&quot; cruised for 3 days to the South West Caribbean sea off the Panama and Colombian coasts, where Seal Team Six departed. It is unclear if the operation was an attempt to capture Manuel Noriega, or if it was in support of Operation Pokeweed to apprehend Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.

The year of 1991 was one of anticipation and change for &quot;Forrestal&quot; and her crew, as she spent the first five months maintaining combat readiness as the east coast ready carrier. Maintaining a hectic and challenging period of at-sea operations, &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s anticipated deployment in support of Operation Desert Storm was not to be, and orders to deploy were canceled twice during the conflict. The call to deploy finally came and &quot;Forrestal&quot; commenced the 22nd and final operational deployment on 30 May 1991.

No less challenging than the months of maintaining readiness for combat, &quot;Forrestal&quot;″s deployment was repeatedly referred to as &quot;transitional.&quot; During the ensuing six months, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was called upon to provide air power presence and airborne intelligence support for Operation Provide Comfort, and to initiate, test and evaluate a wide range of innovative Sixth Fleet battle group tactics and new carrier roles.

The year ended with &quot;Forrestal&quot; making advanced preparations for a change of homeport to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and the transition into a new role as the Navy&#x27;s training carrier, replacing . &quot;Forrestal&quot; was redesignated AVT-59 and arrived in Pensacola on 4 February. The ship and crew returned to New Orleans for a visit in May, 1992. &quot;Forrestal&quot; arrived in Philadelphia on 14 September 1992 to begin a 14-month, $157 million complex overhaul prior to assuming duties as a training carrier. In early 1993, however, the Navy decided to decommission &quot;Forrestal&quot; and leave the Navy without a dedicated training carrier.

==Decommissioning and fate==
After more than 37 years of service, &quot;Forrestal&quot; was decommissioned on 11 September 1993 at Pier 6E in Philadelphia, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. After being stricken, ex-&quot;Forrestal&quot; was heavily stripped to support the rest of the carrier fleet. Two 30 ton anchors were transferred to , while the ship&#x27;s four nearly new bronze propellers were installed on , then under construction. On 16 June 1999, the Navy announced that the ship would be available for donation to an eligible organization for use as a museum or memorial. The USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; Museum Inc. began a campaign to obtain the ship from the Navy via donation, for use as a museum, to be located in Baltimore, but this plan was not successful. No other viable applications were received and the vessel was removed from donation hold in December 2003 and redesignated for disposal. According to the NVR, efforts were made to determine her viability to be &quot;donated for use as fishing reef.&quot; In 2007, the ship was environmentally prepared for sinking as an artificial reef as was USS &quot;Oriskany&quot;. Due to elements of the &quot;Forrestal&quot; design having led directly to current aircraft carrier design, it was intended that the ship be donated to a state and sunk to become a deep water reef, for fishery propagation and not be accessible to divers. That plan never materialized.

On 15 June 2010, ex-&quot;Forrestal&quot; departed Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, where she had been stored since 1998, under tow for the inactive ship storage facility in Philadelphia and tied up at Pier 4, next to ex-.
On 26 January 2012, the Navy&#x27;s Naval Sea Systems Command posted a notice of solicitation for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class aircraft carriers in the United States, to include ex-&quot;Forrestal&quot; (CV-59), ex-, ex-, and ex-. These solicitations were posted in May 2012 and subsequently awarded to three successful offerors, pending their receipt of the facility security clearance required as part of the contract award. After the initial award of one carrier to each successful offeror, this contract provides the Navy with the capability to scrap other decommissioned conventionally-powered aircraft carriers over a five-year period.

In October 2013, it was announced ex-&quot;Forrestal&quot; would be scrapped by All Star Metals in Brownsville, Texas, at a cost of 1 cent. She left the Philadelphia Naval Yard via a team of tugboats at 5:00AM on 4 February 2014. She arrived at All Star Metals in Brownsville on 18 February 2014 for final scrapping. According to the Naval Vessel Register, scrapping was completed 15 December 2015. Her stern plate was saved and restored and now is in the hands of the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. The ships anchors were preserved and installed on the USS John C. Stennis during refueling and complex overhaul in July of 2023.

<doc id="215298" wikidata="Q1382614" url="?curid=215298" title="John G. Bennett">
<text>John Godolphin Bennett (8 June 1897 – 13 December 1974) was a British academic and author. He is best known for his books on psychology and spirituality, particularly on the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff. Bennett met Gurdjieff in Istanbul in October 1920 and later helped to co-ordinate the work of Gurdjieff in England after the guru had moved to Paris. He also was active in starting the British section of the Subud movement, and co-founded its British headquarters.

Bennett was born in London, England; educated at King&#x27;s College School, London; Royal Military Academy, Woolwich; School of Military Engineering, Chatham; and the School of Oriental Studies, London. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Fuel, London, from 1938 onwards; Chairman, Conference of Research Associations, 1943–1945; Chairman, Solid Fuel Industry, British Standards Institution, 1937–1942; Chairman and Director, Institute for the comparative study of History, Philosophy, and the Sciences, Kingston upon Thames, 1946–1959.

==Early life, World War I, marriage==

Bennett&#x27;s parents met in Florence, Italy; they later married. His mother was American and his father was British. In Bennett&#x27;s infancy, his family were moderately wealthy and traveled frequently in Europe. In 1912, his father, who was a noted traveller, adventurer and linguist, lost all of his money and his wife&#x27;s in an investment that failed. Bennett later displayed an extraordinary talent for languages, which enabled him to talk with many spiritual teachers in their native tongues. He studied Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic and Christian sacred texts in their original languages.

Bennett makes little reference to his childhood in his autobiography, &quot;Witness&quot;. Elsewhere he credits his mother with instilling in him the virtues of hard work and tolerance.

At school, he excelled in sports and captained the school rugby football team. He won a scholarship in mathematics from Oxford University, but never had the chance to take advantage of this because of the outbreak of the Great War. He continued to play rugby football for the army (against such opponents as the New Zealand national team), breaking his arm once and his collar bone twice.

In the First World War, at the age of nineteen, Bennett served as a subaltern in the Royal Engineers, with responsibility for signals and telegraphy.

In France in March 1918, he was blown off his motorcycle by an exploding shell. Taken to a military hospital, operated upon, and apparently in a coma for six days, Bennett had an out-of-body experience. He became convinced that there is something in man which can exist independently of the body.
:&quot;It was perfectly clear to me that being dead is quite unlike being very ill or very weak or helpless. So far as I was concerned, there was no fear at all. And yet I have never been a brave man and was certainly still afraid of heavy gun fire. I was cognizant of my complete indifference toward my own body.&quot;

This experience set his life on a new course. He described the return to normal consciousness as the return to a body that was now in some sense a stranger.

In the closing months of the First World War, Bennett undertook an intensive course in the Turkish language at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and was posted to Constantinople. He was assigned to a sensitive position in Anglo-Turkish relations, at the time of the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and rise in Turkish nationalism. His fluency made him the confidant of many high-ranking Turkish political figures; it also helped him to develop his knowledge of Turkey and to gain insights into non-European ways of thinking. A notable piece of initiative drew the attention of General Edmund Allenby, and a mention in C-in-C&#x27;s dispatches. Bennett was recruited to be the head of Military Intelligence &quot;B&quot; Division, with responsibility for the entire Middle Eastern region.

:&quot;All day long I was dealing with different races: English, French, Italian, Greek, Armenian, Turkish, Kurdish, Russian, Arab, Jews and people so mixed up as to be no race at all. Each and every one was convinced of the superiority of his own people. How could everyone be right and all the rest wrong? It was nonsense.&quot;

Bennett&#x27;s eighteen months&#x27; tenure in this position were so eventful, that he is still regarded as a major figure in the political life of Turkey in that period. Bennett&#x27;s success resulted in some animosities among his superiors and he was recalled to London in January 1921. He resigned his commission with the rank of Captain and a pension for life. He kept an abiding love for Turkey for the rest of his life.

After the war, Bennett had married Evelyn, with whom he had a daughter, Ann, born August 1920. Evelyn had stayed in England when he was posted to Turkey. Bennett&#x27;s immersion in Turkish affairs and his relationship with Winifred Beaumont, an English woman living in Turkey, placed increasing strain on the marriage. In 1924, Evelyn Bennett sued for divorce. Bennett later married Beaumont, who was twenty years his senior; they were together until her death in 1958. He married a third time in 1958, to Elizabeth Mayall.

==Gurdjieff and Ouspensky==

After the First World War and the Russian Revolution, many displaced people passed through Constantinople en route to the West. Part of Bennett&#x27;s job was to monitor their movements. Among them were G.I. Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky, whom Bennett met through Prince Sabahaddin. This reformist thinker had introduced him to a wide range of religious and occultist systems, including Theosophy and Anthroposophy. Bennett became determined to pursue the search for a deeper reality. He had been profoundly impressed with Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas about the arrangement of the human organism and the possibility of a man&#x27;s transformation to a higher state of being, and would later dedicate much of his life to the elaboration and dissemination of those ideas.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky moved on to Europe, and Bennett remained in Turkey, committed to his work and fascinated by the political and social developments in Turkey. The sultanate fell, and on 29 October 1923 the Turkish republic was proclaimed.

Gurdjieff founded his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at the Château Le Prieuré in Fontainebleau-Avon, south of Paris, in October 1922. Bennett visited in the summer of 1923, spending three months at the institute. This experience further convinced him that Gurdjieff had profound knowledge and understanding of techniques by which man can achieve transformation. Gurdjieff encouraged Bennett to stay longer, but Bennett was short of money and so felt obliged to return to work in England. Though Bennett expected to return to the group soon, he would not meet Gurdjieff again until 1948.

Bennett served the British government as a consultant on the Middle East, and interpreter at the 1924 conference in London intended to settle disputes between Greece and Turkey. He was invited to stand for parliament, but he chose instead to give his personal studies precedence over his public life.

He joined Ouspensky&#x27;s groups, and continued to study Gurdjieff&#x27;s system with them for fifteen years. Ouspensky broke off all contact with Gurdjieff himself in the early 1920s.

==Coal industry==

During this time, Bennett became involved with various coal mining ventures in Greece and Turkey. These were ultimately unsuccessful, but in the process he acquired expertise in mining and coal chemistry. He worked for four years in Greece, where he was also involved in protracted negotiations involving land claims by members of the deposed Turkish royal family.

In 1938, Bennett was asked to head Britain&#x27;s newest industrial research organisation, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA). With the outbreak of World War II, BCURA&#x27;s research was focused on developing fuel-efficient fireplaces and finding alternatives to oil. BCURA developed cars powered by coal-gas and a coal-based plastic.

==Group work==

In 1941, Ouspensky left England to live in the United States. By now, Bennett was running his own study groups and giving talks on the subject of Gurdjieff&#x27;s system. The groups continued and expanded in London throughout the Second World War. Bennett began writing and developing his own ideas in addition to Gurdjieff&#x27;s. Ouspensky repudiated him in 1945, which proved very painful for Bennett. He had lost touch with Gurdjieff during the war and believed him to be dead.

:&quot;Ouspensky fell under the impression that Bennett was setting himself up as a teacher and plagiarising his lecture material. Instructions were sent to all members of Ouspensky&#x27;s groups to disassociate themselves from Bennett, who found himself vilified and ostracised, but still supported by a small loyal following. He decided to go ahead with his work of communicating his understanding of the System to people, and to create a society or institute to serve as its vehicle&quot;.

==Coombe Springs==

In 1946, Bennett and his wife founded the non-profit Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences:

:&quot;To promote research and other scientific work in connection with the factors which influence development and retrogression in man and their operation in individuals and communities; to investigate the origin and elaboration of scientific hypotheses and secular and religious philosophies and their bearing on general theories of Man and his place in the universe; and to study comparative methodology in history, philosophy and natural science&quot;.

The Institute bought Coombe Springs, a seven-acre estate in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, which had housed research laboratories used by BCURA. The Bennetts moved in with ten of Bennett&#x27;s closest pupils, with the intention of starting a small research community. Coombe Springs became a centre for group work. In addition to the small community who lived there permanently, hundreds of people visited Coombe Springs for meetings and summer schools.

The old laboratories were used as dormitory space; they were known as the &quot;fishbowl&quot; because of the large amount of glass they had. A &quot;new building&quot; was later built for superior accommodation. The main house was used for meetings as well as accommodation. Coombe Springs took its name from an original Elizabethan spring house in the grounds. Until the mid-19th century, it had provided water to the palace at Hampton Court.

Bennett believed that Gurdjieff&#x27;s system could be reconciled with modern science. He started work on a five-dimensional geometry which included &quot;eternity&quot; as a second time-like dimension, introducing this in his first published book, &quot;The Crisis in Human Affairs&quot; (1948).

==Reunion with Gurdjieff==

Ouspensky died in 1947. In 1948, Bennett went to the United States and met Ouspensky&#x27;s wife, through whom he learned that Gurdjieff had survived the Nazi occupation of France and was living in Paris. Though it was 25 years since they had last met (due mainly to Ouspensky&#x27;s longstanding veto against Gurdjieff to members of his groups), Bennett quickly decided to renew contact. In the 18 months before Gurdjieff&#x27;s death (in October 1949), Bennett visited him frequently. He also continued his crowded professional schedule (he was now working for the Powell Duffryn coal company) and his responsibilities towards the group work at Coombe Springs.

A month spent working very intensively with Gurdjieff&#x27;s group in the summer of 1949 laid the foundation for a significant transformation in his life and spiritual work. At that time, Gurdjieff&#x27;s apartment in Paris had become a &#x27;Mecca&#x27; to the followers of his ideas, who converged from many different countries. Bennett learnt of Gurdjieff&#x27;s writings, and read &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot; for the first time. At the beginning of 1949, Gurdjieff named Bennett as his &#x27;Representative for England&#x27;. Bennett later gave public lectures in London on Gurdjieff and his ideas.

This period was described by Bennett&#x27;s third wife, Elizabeth Bennett (1918–1991), who was part of the study group, in her book &quot;Idiots in Paris: Diaries of J.G. Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett, 1949&quot;. Her memoir was based on J.G. Bennett&#x27;s diaries and on her own memories. A third paperback edition was published posthumously in 2017.

Gurdjieff&#x27;s death in 1949 was a serious blow for all his followers. Disagreements arose within the group, partly as a result of Gurdjieff&#x27;s having allocated his closest associates with conflicting areas of authority. In Bennett&#x27;s case, the conflict was exacerbated by his own interpretation and development of Gurdieff&#x27;s ideas.

After Gurdjieff&#x27;s death, the various groups looked to Jeanne de Salzmann to give them direction and hold them together, but there was little inherent harmony among them. At this time Bennett was a member of a small group headed by Madame de Salzmann, and he put his work at Coombe Springs under her overall guidance.

In 1950, Bennett was falsely accused of harbouring communists on his staff, during a communist scare in Great Britain, and he was forced to resign from Powell Dufryn. (He later resisted several attractive offers to return to a career in industrial research and administration). He began to concentrate more fully on the group work at Coombe Springs. He lectured frequently, trying to fulfill a promise he had made to Gurdjieff to do everything in his power to propagate his ideas. Friendly relations continued with Madame de Salzmann and her groups throughout 1951 and 1952, but by then Bennett was convinced that his more senior students were not making progress. He believed that he had to learn firsthand whether there still existed an ancient tradition or source from which Gurdjieff had derived his teaching.

==Travels in the Middle East==

In 1953, Bennett undertook a long journey to the Middle East (West Asia), visiting Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. His search, chronicled in his book &quot;Journeys in Islamic Countries&quot; (reprinted in paperback in 2001), brought him into contact with Sufis of extraordinary spiritual accomplishment, such as Emin Chikou (1890–1964) (known in Syria as Mohammad Amin Sheikho) and Farhâd Dede (1882-1977), the former of whom led Bennett indirectly to a profound meeting with Shaykh Abdullah Fa&#x27;izi ad-Daghestani (1891–1973). Bennett described him as &quot;a true saint in whom one feels an immediate complete trust. With him there were no lengthy arguments or quotations from the scriptures.&quot; Their chance meeting on a mountaintop in Damascus is chronicled, albeit briefly, in his book &quot;Subud.&quot; Bennett concludes that Shaykh Daghestani was in possession of &quot;powers of a kind that I had already seen in Gurdjieff and one or two others, and prepared me to take very seriously anything that he might [have to] say.&quot;

During 1954, differences of opinion became more obvious between Bennett and Madame de Salzmann regarding the promulgation of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings. Bennett decided that an effectual working relationship with her groups was not possible. He wanted to execute Gurdjieff&#x27;s last directives literally, by disseminating his ideas and writings as widely as possible, especially &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to his Grandson&quot;, which Madame de Salzmann wanted to keep away from the public eye.

In 1955, Bennett initiated a project to build an unusual nine-sided meeting hall at Coombe Springs for the performance of Gurdjieff&#x27;s sacred dance movements. This, together with his public lectures in London, completed the rift with Madame de Salzmann. The project took two years to complete. At the opening in 1957, Bennett commented that the real value of such a project was in building a community rather than the building itself.

==Subud==

In 1956, Bennett was introduced to Subud, a spiritual movement originating in Java (an island in the Republic of Indonesia). For a number of reasons, Bennett felt that Gurdjieff had expected the arrival of a very important teaching from Indonesia. In spite of deep reservations, in November 1956 Bennett allowed himself to be &#x27;opened&#x27; by Husein Rofé, a native Englishman (1922–2008) who had studied in the East. Rofé used the latihan (the primary spiritual exercise used in Subud).

Bennett regarded the latihan as being akin to what the mystics call diffuse contemplation. He also felt that the latihan has the power to awaken a person&#x27;s conscience, the spiritual faculty that Gurdjieff regarded as necessary for salvation. Bennett sent an invitation to Subud&#x27;s founder, Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (1901–1987) (aka Pak Subuh), to come to England. Pak Subuh came to Coombe Springs, where all Bennett&#x27;s pupils were given the opportunity to be &#x27;opened&#x27;.
Soon Bennett was instrumental in spreading Subud practice all over the world. He travelled extensively to spread the Subud exercise, sometimes in the company of Pak Subuh. Bennett translated Pak Subuh&#x27;s lectures into various languages. His introductory book on Subud, titled &quot;Concerning Subud&quot; (1959), sold thousands of copies worldwide.

Bennett&#x27;s deep involvement in Subud meant less participation in the work-group activities and exercises that had been practised until he began this work. The meeting hall was left unfinished without its intended viewers&#x27; balcony and its striking pentagonal floor was filled in to allow for latihans. Its original purpose was not to be fulfilled for many years.

Some of Bennett&#x27;s pupils were dismayed. Subud&#x27;s spontaneous exercise seemed to some to be the antithesis of Gurdjieff&#x27;s methods for spiritual awakening, and Bennett&#x27;s enthusiasm for it served to deepen the divisions within the Gurdjieff groups. Many people left the Coombe Springs groups, but others came in large numbers. For several years Coombe Springs was the headquarters of the Subud movement in Europe, attracting both serious seekers and sensation seekers.

In 1958, monks from the Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille, interested in Subud, contacted Bennett. The following year he made the first of many visits to the abbey to teach the monks. These visits brought him into close contact with the Catholic Church. Dom Albert-Jacques Bescond, OSB (1920–1986) was the first monk from the abbey to be &#x27;opened&#x27;, followed by many others. At St. Wandrille, Bennett first had a deep experience of what he believed was the destined unification of Islam and Christianity. He had given this possibility philosophical expression through his concept of &#x27;essential will&#x27;, as detailed in his &quot;The Dramatic Universe&quot; (4 vols). Soon after, he formally entered the Catholic Church.

By 1960, Bennett had concluded that the practice of &#x27;latihan&#x27; alone was inadequate, and he resumed the work that he had learned from Gurdjieff. By 1962, Bennett left the Subud organization, feeling that a return to the Gurdjieff method was necessary.

Although he always said that he had derived great benefit from Subud, his departure aroused animosity and dismay from Subud members, and many turned against him.

Meanwhile, the Institute had been largely given over to Subud to the extent, at one time, of instigating a move to forbid the sale of Gurdjieff&#x27;s books at Coombe Springs. In spite of this, Bennett reinstated lecture courses on psychokinetics, an action that led to increasing conflict among the membership.

A battle of power ensued in 1962 that resulted in Subud acquiring its own organization and Bennett resigning from the Subud brotherhood and his role as leader of the Coombe Springs Community and Director of Research of the institute.

From 1963, the pattern of exercises that were subsequently followed at Coombe Springs combined the latihan with different techniques such as the Gurdjieff movements. The meeting hall was completed with the fitting of a balcony for viewers and an external access through stairs for spectators. Lectures were held on topics ranging from Sufism to Synchronicity, and Bennett resumed work on the final volumes of his &quot;personal whim&quot;, the epic &#x27;The Dramatic Universe&#x27;, which he had been working on for more than ten years, constantly writing, revising and re-writing.

==Shivapuri Baba==

Meanwhile, Bennett had made contact with the Shivapuri Baba, a Hindu sage living in Nepal. He had first heard of the Shivapuri Baba in the early 1940s, and now learned from Hugh Ripman (a fellow student of Ouspensky) that the yogi was still alive.

Bennett visited the Shivapuri Baba twice between 1961 and 1963, by which time the Shivapuri Baba was reportedly 137 years old. Bennett was impressed with the vitality and simplicity of the Shivapuri Baba&#x27;s teaching, and later referred to him as his teacher. Bennett undertook to propagate the Shivapuri Baba&#x27;s teaching, and made various attempts to incorporate it into his own work.

The Shivapuri Baba died in 1963, shortly after he had approved the draft for his biography, Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Long Pilgrimage - The Life and Teaching of the Shivapuri Baba&quot;.

==ISERG==

In 1962, Bennett gave a seminar on spiritual psychology in which the various elements he had received (particularly from Gurdjieff, Subud and the Shivapuri Baba) were integrated into a coherent psycho-cosmology. This marked a major step in his understanding of a comprehensive methodology which combined both active and receptive &quot;lines of work&quot;.

By this time Bennett was also working with a group of young scientists called ISERG (Integral Science Education Research Group) headed by Dr. Anthony Hodgson and soon joined by Anthony George Edward Blake, Kenneth Pledge, Henri Bortoft and others. This group investigated educational methods, the nature of science, and similar subjects. The group maintained a contact with physicist and philosopher David Bohm.

Research fellowships were created to enable Hodgson and Blake to concentrate their time on educational work. Out of this came the idea of structural communication which led the Institute into co-operative work with G.E.C. in the field of teaching machines.

In 1963, Bennett launched the institute&#x27;s journal, &quot;Systematics&quot;. The journal was designed to spread the ideas of the discipline of Systematics, a practical analytical method based on his own researches into the laws governing processes in the natural world. The journal ran for 11 years with major contributions from all disciplines.

==Idries Shah==

While the educational work was progressing, Bennett learned of Idries Shah, an exponent of Sufism. When they met, Shah presented Bennett with a document supporting his claim to represent the &quot;Guardians of the Tradition&quot;. Bennett and other followers of Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas were astonished to meet a man claiming to represent what Gurdjieff had called &quot;The Inner Circle of Humanity&quot;, something they had discussed for so long without hope of its concrete manifestation.

Bennett introduced &quot;teaching stories&quot; to his groups on Shah&#x27;s instructions. These are now widely published and recognized as important teaching materials containing the essence of Sufi knowledge and insight.

It remained unclear as to what the future relationship between the institute, Bennett and Shah could become. Due to extreme pressure from Shah, Bennett eventually decided to put Coombe Springs at Shah&#x27;s disposal to do with as he saw fit. In October 1965 at an extraordinary General Meeting of the institute, Bennett persuaded the membership to take this step.

Shah originally indicated that he would take Bennett&#x27;s psychological groups under his own wing. Bennett welcomed this, as it would allow him to concentrate on research and writing. However, he again found himself unpopular - not only with conservatives within the institute, but also with other followers of Idries Shah and members of his organisation SUFI (Society for the Understanding of the Foundation of Ideas).

In the spring of 1966, The Institute for Comparative Study donated Coombe Springs to Shah, who promptly sold it for a housing development. The Djamee was destroyed. About half the people who had studied under Bennett were integrated into his groups while the rest were left &#x27;in the air&#x27;. The institute was left with the educational research work as its main focus. The work with the Hirst Research Laboratories of G.E.C. bore fruit in the new teaching machine, the &#x27;Systemaster&#x27;, and Bennett organised various young people around him to write and develop teaching materials that followed the structural communication method.

Bennett and some of the Coombe Springs residents had moved into a nearby house in Kingston upon Thames, where the family (the Bennetts now had two sons and two young daughters) would live quietly for four years before Bennett embarked on his last great project - an experimental school for passing on techniques for spiritual transformation.

==International Academy for Continuous Education==

By 1969 the company which had been formed to explore structural communication – Structural Communication Systems Ltd. – was floundering and Bennett&#x27;s health, too, was in a dangerous state. After his recovery, Bennett looked afresh at the situation and the conviction came to him that he should take up the work that Gurdjieff had started at the Prieuré in 1923 and been forced to abandon. He would start a School of the Fourth Way.

Bennett became very interested in young people, especially those who surfaced from the social and cultural turmoil of the 1960s with serious questions about the significance of life but with few satisfactory answers. As part of his research, Bennett attended the rock music festival on the Isle of Wight in 1970. The outcome was the establishment of an &quot;academy&quot; to teach some of what he had learned in trying to discover the &quot;sense and aim of life, and of human life in particular.&quot;
On the twenty fifth anniversary of the institute, in April 1971, a jubilee celebration on the theme of The Whole Man was held. In a very short time, primarily in the US, Bennett recruited many students and in October 1971 the International Academy for Continuous Education was inaugurated in Sherborne, Gloucestershire.

Bennett had begun this enterprise with no programme in mind and with only a handful of helpers. Initially, his ideas had involved running a school in the midst of &#x27;life-conditions&#x27; in Kingston with two dozen students, but contact with a young representative of the New Age Movement in the USA persuaded him to think in terms of larger numbers and a relatively isolated locale in the countryside. Bennett realized that work on the land (which he considered to be an essential part of teaching the proper relationship between mankind and the rest of creation) would require a larger number. Both Hasan Shushud and Idries Shah made recommendations that, for the most part, he disregarded.

He quickly attracted one hundred pupils, and in 1971, with the support of the Institute for Comparative Study, he inaugurated the International Academy for Continuous Education, in the village of Sherborne, Gloucestershire, England.

The name was chosen &quot;to indicate on the one hand its Platonic inspiration and on the other to emphasise that it was to offer a teaching for the whole life of the men and women who came to it.&quot;

As he tells the story in his autobiography, although various spiritual leaders had urged him at various points in his life to strike out on his own path, it was not until near the end of his years that he felt fully confident to assume the mantle of the teacher. Bennett relates how Gurdjieff had told him in 1923 that one day Bennett would &quot;follow in his footsteps and take up the work he had started at Fontainebleau.&quot; In 1970, following the promptings of a still, small voice from within that said, &quot;You are to found a school&quot;,

Bennett proposed that there should be five experimental courses each of ten months duration. The courses proved fruitful, and many people have continued, as he had hoped, to work with the ideas and methods he presented.

In April 1972, the Sufi Hasan Lutfi Shushud (1901-1988) came to stay for a few months at the Academy. Shushud and Bennett had met in Turkey ten years previously, and Shushud had visited Bennett&#x27;s Surrey home in 1968, at which time he initiated Bennett into his wordless, universal zikr. Bennett concluded that Shushud&#x27;s wordless universal zikr produced results similar to those of the latihan, while omitting many of the risks attendant on &#x27;opening&#x27; people through Subud. Bennett observed that occasionally there are people &#x27;opened&#x27; through Subud who experience some harsh and/or dangerous effects (for which they are unprepared) during the operation of the latihan. This observation led him to have reservations about the supposed absolute safety of the latihan for the general public. As a result of these reservations, Bennett became increasingly attracted to the Khwajagan (Masters of Wisdom of Central Asia) as presented in the teachings of Shushud. In 1973 Bennett&#x27;s publisher Alick Bartholomew commissioned Bennett and Shushud to co-write a book whose tentative title was &quot;Gurdjieff and the Masters of Wisdom&quot;. Before the book was ready for publication Shushud pulled out of the project, telling Bennett that he did not trust the publisher, apparently on the grounds that Bartholomew had deducted state income tax from the advance payment for the book. However, eventually it became known that what Shushud was really objecting to was Bennett&#x27;s contention in the book that Gurdjieff had established personal contact with the Khwajagan, and that therefore it is very likely that at least some of Gurdjieff&#x27;s major teachings are based directly on what he had learned from the Khwajagan. Due to Shushud&#x27;s disagreements with Bennett over this issue, Bennett ended up dividing the proposed book into two separate books, titled respectively &quot;Gurdjieff: Making a New World&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Masters of Wisdom&quot; (1975) (not published until after Bennett&#x27;s death). However, in spite of Shushud&#x27;s disagreements with Bennett over this issue, it appears that Bennett nevertheless (in the end) borrowed heavily from Shushud&#x27;s teachings on the Khwajagan (probably against Shushud&#x27;s wishes), in order to bring his book on that subject (&quot;The Masters of Wisdom&quot;) to a successful conclusion.

There are a number of mysterious things about Shushud, who certainly had unusual powers. Bennett makes a brief reference to these in his book &quot;Witness&quot;, and many others have attested to them. While criticising Bennett&#x27;s methods, Shushud impressed on him that &quot;Your only home is the Absolute Void&quot;. However, Shushud eventually agreed that what Bennett was doing for young Western seekers was more suitable for them than his own strict methods of fasting and zikr.

In the same year (1973), Bennett began editing Gurdjieff&#x27;s Third Series of writings, &quot;Life is Real Only Then When I Am&quot;, undertaking its publication on behalf of the Gurdjieff family (who were having difficulties in dealing with the Gurdjieff Foundation). He also revisited Turkey, meeting with Hajji Muzaffer Özak al-Jerrahi (1916–1985), the Grand Shaykh of the Halveti-Jerrahi Sufi Order.

During the period of the second course at the Academy, a Theravada Buddhist monk and teacher from Cambodia named Bhante Dharmawara (1889–1999) came to Sherborne at Bennett&#x27;s invitation. During his visit Dharmawara introduced meditation techniques that continue to be practised by many people.

Other visitors to the Academy were Süleyman Dede (1904–1985), head of the Mevlevi Order in Konya, as well as Süleyman Dede&#x27;s disciple Reshad Feild (1934–2016). Idries Shah paid a brief visit during the first year, but soon left, with harsh views on the attitudes and disposition of the students.

Throughout the period of the institute&#x27;s existence, Bennett had been toying with the idea of founding a spiritual community. He saw the Sermon on the Mount as a document describing the true community.
His contact with Idries Shah combined this in his mind with the possibility of establishing a Power House where &#x27;enabling energies&#x27; could be concentrated. He set his sights on some kind of self-sufficient community, populated by Sherborne graduates, to evolve out of the school. He was profoundly influenced by contemporary ideas, such as those of Schumacher, about the need for alternative technology and by the argument of conservationists for intelligent, ecologically sound agriculture. He was also greatly impressed that his spiritual hero and inner teacher, Khwaja Ubaidallah Ahrar (15th century) had turned to farming after his period of training.

The soaring price of land in the UK led to Bennett&#x27;s interest in starting something in the US. In 1974, he signed an agreement whereby the institute loaned $100,000 to a newly formed society for the foundation of a psychokinetic community. He signed this document shortly before his death on 13 December 1974.

The Claymont Society was founded to attempt to carry out Bennett&#x27;s vision, but without the help of his guidance.

In the summer of 1974, he visited the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rome to question him about Transcendental Meditation and his interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita. Bennett had been initiated into TM several years before and first met the Maharishi in 1959. He disputed Maharishi&#x27;s presentation of the Gita in which he eliminated the need for sacrifice and suffering.

In the last year of his life, he gradually made it known to those working with him, that his own personal task centred on the creation of a way of religious worship that would be accessible to men and women of the West who were lacking in religious formation. During this period he made experiments with the Islamic namaz and Sufi zikr.

The teachings he developed in his last years were recorded and published in a series of books put together by Anthony Blake. He showed that at last he was independent of Gurdjieff and had his own understanding of the spiritual world, based on a radical questioning of all current assumptions.

Bennett died on Friday 13 December 1974, shortly after the start of the fourth course. That course, and the fifth, were completed by his wife, working with a few of his most experienced pupils.

With his death the institute was faced with the typical problems of a body which had been led almost single-handedly by one man since its inception. The decision was taken to continue the Academy&#x27;s work until the five-year period, originally specified by Bennett, had been completed. The setting up of the US community at Claymont Court, West Virginia, went ahead.

In the months before he died, Bennett worked to establish an experimental &quot;ideal human society&quot; embodying the methods and ideas that he had developed and derived from Gurdjieff. He made substantial efforts to overcome the rifts that had grown between different groups of Gurdjieff&#x27;s followers, and was beginning to talk about the development of new forms of worship appropriate for the modern world.
