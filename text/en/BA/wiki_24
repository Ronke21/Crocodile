<text>George Clarence &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran (; born Adelard Leo Cunin; August 21, 1893 – February 25, 1957) was an American Chicago Prohibition-era gangster. He was incarcerated three times before his 21st birthday. Seven members of his gang were gunned down and killed in a warehouse in the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre of February 14, 1929, supposedly on the orders of his rival Al Capone.

==Early life and career==
Moran was born Adelard Cunin to a French immigrant father, Jules Adelard Cunin, and a mother of Canadian descent, Marie Diana Gobeil, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He attended Cretin High School, a private Catholic school in Saint Paul, but he also joined a local juvenile gang and left school at age 18. He was later caught robbing a store and was sent to the state juvenile correctional facility, and was put in jail three times before he turned 21. He then fled to Chicago where he was caught trying to rob a warehouse, taking part in a horse-stealing ring, taking part in robbery involving the death of a police officer, and robbing a freight car, for which he received a variety of prison and jail sentences. That is when young Adelard Cunin first adopted the name George Moran; it was the first name he thought of when police asked him who he was. George Moran was a violent and unstable man who got the nickname &quot;Bugs&quot; because everyone thought he was nuts or &quot;buggy&quot;.

==Prohibition==
Prohibition was established in 1920 with the enactment of the 18th Amendment, which banned the distribution of alcoholic beverages, resulting in bootlegging. Among the involved gangs were Dean O&#x27;Banion and his mostly Irish group, including Bugs Moran, who became known as the North Side Gang and Al Capone as the leader of the Italian mob on the South Side. These two rivals fought violently, resulting in what is known as &quot;The Bootleg Battle of the Marne&quot;.

==Battling Al Capone==
The bootlegging operation of Hymie Weiss and Bugs Moran continued to pose a significant challenge to Capone&#x27;s South Side Gang. Moran and Capone then fought a turf war with each other that cost them both. Moran&#x27;s hatred of Capone was apparent even to the public. Moran was disgusted that Capone engaged in prostitution. He would not engage in prostitution rings because of his Catholic religion. Johnny Torrio&#x27;s gang killed Dean O&#x27;Banion, and in an attempt to avenge him, Bugs Moran and Earl &quot;Hymie&quot; Weiss made an attempt on Torrio&#x27;s life. Later they went on to make a failed attempt on Al Capone&#x27;s life at his headquarters, the Hawthorne Inn in Cicero, Illinois. More than one thousand shots were fired at the inn and at a nearby restaurant in their attempts to kill Capone. In retaliation, Weiss was killed by Capone&#x27;s gang, and Moran became the new boss of the North Side Gang.

According to Paul Maccabee, a historian of Twin Cities organized crime, Bugs Moran had a close friendship with St. Paul–based Irish mob boss Danny Hogan. Following Hogan&#x27;s murder by car bomb on December 4, 1928, Bugs Moran personally stood guard outside the Hogan family residence at West Seventh Street in St. Paul, &quot;apparently to protect the Hogan family from further underworld attacks.&quot;

Responding to Weiss&#x27;s death, Moran tried to kill a member of Capone&#x27;s gang, resulting in an attack, allegedly by Capone, known as the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre.

==The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre==

On February 14, 1929, seven members of Moran&#x27;s gang died in what came to be called the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. Moran was offered a truckload of whiskey at a bargain price, which he had ordered to be delivered at 10:30 a.m. to the garage of the S.M.C. Cartage Company on North Clark Street, where he kept his bootlegging trucks.

Two gunmen—dressed as Chicago police officers and two others in plain clothes—lined up Moran&#x27;s people (and two men who were not gang members and just happened to be there by chance) against the wall in the warehouse and shot them. Bugs Moran, the main target of the assassination, was not present, arriving late; when he saw the approaching police car, he turned around going to a nearby café instead. Another North Sider, Al Weinshank, was misidentified as Moran by one of the lookouts who signaled for the attack to begin.
Police response was delayed when witnesses saw the two &quot;police officers&quot; exit the scene. There were six corpses and another man near death when police arrived on the scene. The survivor, Frank Gusenberg, following the gangsters&#x27; code of silence, refused to identify the killers before dying. When Moran learned of the carnage, he broke the gangster code, accusing Capone of the murders. No one was convicted. Capone was in Florida on the day of the massacre. He denied involvement in the massacre, though he was twice summoned to court, which he avoided by claimed illness.

There is some evidence implicating Chicago police officers in the killings. Prior to the massacre, some officers were stealing bootleg liquor from the gang&#x27;s trucks and were allegedly disciplined by the chief of police, but no substantiation is available.

==After Prohibition==
Moran managed to keep control of his territory and what remained of his gang through the early 1930s, but the North Side gang never fully recovered its power or former place in Chicago&#x27;s underworld as the chief rival to Capone&#x27;s Italian mob. Moran eventually left the area, quitting the gang entirely—though not the criminal lifestyle. He reverted to committing petty crimes, such as mail fraud and robbery.

On April 30, 1939, Moran was convicted of conspiracy to cash $62,000 worth of American Express checks. He was freed on appeal when he posted a bond; he fled but was captured and not released until December 21, 1944. He was almost penniless by the 1940s, only 17 years after being one of the richest gangsters in Chicago. On July 6, 1946, he was arrested for his involvement in the robbery of a Dayton, Ohio, tavern on June 28, 1945, and received a sentence of 20 years. He was paroled in 1956, but was immediately arrested for his role in the 1945 robbery of a bank in Ansonia, Ohio. He was found guilty in 1957 and sentenced to 10 more years in prison.

==Death in prison==
Moran died of lung cancer a few months into his 10-year sentence at Leavenworth Federal Prison in Kansas on February 25, 1957, at the age of 63.

==Personal life==
Moran married Lucille Logan Bilezikdian, with whom he had a son, John George Moran. She left him because of his criminal lifestyle. In 1922, he married Evelyn Herrell.

<text>In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching is a 1949 book by Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspensky which recounts his meeting and subsequent association with George Gurdjieff.

According to Sophia Wellbeloved, the book is generally regarded as the most comprehensive account of Gurdjieff&#x27;s system of thought ever published, as it often forms the basis from which Gurdjieff and his teachings are understood.

==Contents==
&quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot; is Ouspensky&#x27;s recollection of his first meeting and subsequent association with George Gurdjieff and the esoteric teaching that Gurdjieff imparted to him. This teaching still exists today in various forms; Ouspensky himself taught it to various groups from 1921–1947. Throughout the book, Ouspensky never refers to Gurdjieff directly, only using the single initial &quot;G.&quot;, but it is common knowledge that this &quot;G.&quot; was Gurdjieff, who taught Ouspensky an ancient esoteric system of self-development commonly known as the Fourth Way.

The book begins with Ouspensky returning home to St. Petersburg from his recent excursion to the East, where he journeyed &quot;in search of the miraculous&quot;, as he put it. He soon meets a mysterious man, a certain &quot;G.&quot;, who has all the answers for which Ouspensky has been arduously searching all his life. He immediately joins Gurdjieff&#x27;s esoteric school, and begins learning a certain system of self-development which originated in the East, allegedly during the most remote antiquity, possibly millennia before recorded history.

Ouspensky recounts his trials learning this new system, which he later refers to as the Fourth Way, often recollecting entire lectures, or parts of lectures, which Gurdjieff gave to his disciples in St. Petersburg and Moscow from 1915–1917. He describes many of his experiences, particularly concerning the &quot;art of self-remembering&quot;, and he recounts some of the methods and various exercises which comprised Gurdjieff&#x27;s system.

The book concludes with his experiences during the Bolshevik Revolution and his and Gurdjieff&#x27;s eventual escape to the West, where they continued to teach Gurdjieff&#x27;s system to many followers until their respective deaths in 1947 and 1949. The latter part of the book also describes the author&#x27;s feelings and motives behind his eventual decision to teach the system independently, not under the direct supervision of his teacher, Gurdjieff, which he formally announced to his students in London in early 1924.

==Publication==
The book was published posthumously in 1949 by Ouspensky&#x27;s students, two years after his death. Ouspensky originally titled the book simply &quot;Fragments of an Unknown Teaching&quot;, reflecting his view that Gurdjieff&#x27;s system had to be &quot;assembled&quot; by the student himself, as well as his view that much of the original system was probably lost. It was also an oblique reference to a book by the well-known Theosophist and friend of Ouspensky, G.R.S. Mead called &quot;Fragments of a Faith Forgotten&quot;. Mead&#x27;s book was a collection of fragments of an almost forgotten religion: Hermetism. Ouspensky recognized this as one of Gurdjieff&#x27;s sources and used the title as an oblique reference. However, the publisher insisted on adding the prefix &quot;In Search of The Miraculous&quot;, which became the more commonly known shortened name for the book.

Originally published at the time of Gurdjieff&#x27;s death and authorized by Gurdjieff himself, it is considered one of the best expositions of the structure of Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas and is often used as a means of teaching Gurdjieff&#x27;s system, although Ouspensky himself never endorsed its use in such a broad manner. Nevertheless, this book is by far the most quoted by current disciples of Gurdjieff as they attempt to teach his system to new students, and Gurdjieff himself even had some of his students read parts of the book as part of their studies.

The 2001 edition has a foreword by writer Marianne Williamson, in which she notes the book&#x27;s reputation as being a classic, or even a primer, in the teaching of esoteric principles and ideas. The 2004 facsimile edition of the first edition is identical in every way apart from a few modifications.

<text>Grodno Region, also known as Grodno Oblast or Hrodna Voblasts, is a region of Belarus. Its administrative centre and its namesake, Grodno, is the largest city in the whole region. As of 2024, it has a population of 992,556.

Located in western Belarus, it lies on the Neman River. The region borders the Minsk region to the east, the Brest region to the south, Poland (Podlaskie Voivodeship) to the west and the Vitebsk region and Lithuania (Alytus and Vilnius counties) to the north.

==History==
This region comprised the westernmost &quot;borderlands&quot; of the early East Slavs (possibly the tribal union Dregoviches) on the lands of the Balts in the 6th–9th centuries CE. The city of Grodno is first mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; under the year 1127 as &quot;Goroden&quot;. It was located at the crossing of numerous trading routes, possibly originating as far as the late 10th century. It also became the capital of a poorly attested but separate principality. In the 12th–14th centuries, it formed part of the area sometimes known as Black Ruthenia, which was fully incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. The Baltic Yotvingians who inhabited the Grodno region became increasingly Lithuanized, especially during the formation of the State of Lithuania in the 13th century. As a result, Grodno and its surroundings were included in Ethnographic Lithuania for long thereafter. (e.g. in the 19th century the Lithuanian-inhabited areas were still nearby the present-day suburbs of Grodno city).

In 1413, the area became administratively divided between the newly established Trakai Voivodeship and the Vilnius Voivodeship. In 1507, the southern part of the current oblast became part of the newly formed Nowogródek Voivodeship. Historical cities of notable importance were Grodno (seat of Grodno County and one of the main royal residences of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), Nowogródek (provincial capital since 1507), county seats of Vawkavysk, Slonim, Lida, and Mir, (a private town of the Radziwiłł family). These cities were granted the Magdeburg Law charters in 1441, 1511, 1503, 1532, 1590, and 1579 respectively.

The strong economic development of the area continued during the reign of King Casimir&#x27;s son — Duke Alexander Jagiellon of Lithuania () — who founded the first solid bridge over the Neman River, as well as the monasteries of the Order of Saint Augustine and of the Polish Order of Friars Minor. Later, Bona Sforza, Queen-Consort of Poland and Grand Duchess-Consort of Lithuania (r. 1518–1548), established her royal residence in Grodno. According to medieval surveys, Grodno had 35 streets and 700 houses in 1558.

The golden age of Grodno came with the reign of Stephen Báthory, King of Poland (). During his reign, Grodno became a royal headquarters and began to host sessions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Senate and Parliament (Sejm). In 1580, on the king&#x27;s order, the castle of Grodno was rebuilt in Renaissance architectural style by Scoto di Parma.
At the beginning of the 17th century, Grodno, one of the most developed and important cities in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was traditionally recognized as the third capital of the commonwealth. Deterioration of the province&#x27;s status began with the Livonian War between 1558 and 1583, which pitted the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Swedish Empire in a lengthy and exhausting military conflict against the Tsardom of Russia. Between 1765 and 1780, the province regained some of its previous status when Antoni Tyzenhaus, the Treasurer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and administrator of Polish royal estates, governed the capital and the province. Tyzenhaus fostered around 50 new commercial endeavors in the region with the building of manufactures, mills and workshops.

As part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and due to subsequent Partitions of Poland, the whole of the Grodno region was annexed by the Russian Empire by the end of 1795. The city of Grodno then became a seat for the Grodno Governorate.

During World War I, the governorate was occupied by the German Empire. German troops entered Grodno city on 3 September 1915, plundering the &quot;Library of Dominicans Order&quot;. During the German occupation, Polish citizens were persecuted and had restricted civil rights. Towards the end of the war, the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic (BNR) declared its independence from Soviet Russia in March 1918 in Minsk. Grodno was the site of the last stand of the BNR&#x27;s Council (&quot;Rada&quot;). Soon, the council was forced to flee as Soviet troops invaded the region and the city in 1919 in a prelude to the Polish–Soviet War.
Under the terms of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the region and the city returned to the Second Polish Republic which claimed rights to this territory as a successor to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and as a victorious side of the Polish–Soviet War. By 1939, Grodno city had 60,000 inhabitants, with Poles and Jews accounting for 60% and 37% of the population, respectively. During Polish rule, Grodno was the center of Grodno County in Białystok Voivodeship, but some parts of present Grodno region were in the voivodeships of Nowogródek and Wilno.

After World War II started, on 17 September 1939 (Soviet Invasion of Poland), the Grodno area was invaded by the Soviet Union, and forcibly incorporated into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Over 300 captured Polish defenders of Grodno, including Polish Army officers and youth, were summarily executed by Soviet forces. Grodno was located in the newly established Belastok region. Thousands were imprisoned or deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. In the early summer of 1941, the region fell under German occupation as part of Operation Barbarossa. During the Soviet retreat, more executions of Polish prisoners of war occurred in Grodno.

In November 1941, the occupation forces established the Grodno Ghetto for Jewish citizens of Grodno and the rest of the region. In 1942, after a year of severe persecution and planned starvation of ghetto inhabitants, 10,000 Jews from Grodno were deported to the German concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau to be killed. The following year, in 1943, 17,000 of the surviving ghetto inhabitants were also deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as to the Treblinka extermination camp and the Białystok Ghetto.

As of 13 March 1943, German troops reported the completion of the extermination and declared Grodno city &quot;judenfrei&quot; (free of Jews). However, around 50 Jews had survived, some hidden by non-Jewish families. Polish and Soviet underground forces acted in the region. Villages like Dziarečyn, which originally had large Jewish populations, were greatly reduced.

As a result of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policy of expansion to the west, it was decided (during the Yalta Conference) that the Polish eastern border would be set roughly along the Curzon Line. Based on this decision, the left-bank part of Grodno town would be kept within the borders of Poland. It is not clear how the original Curzon Line near Grodno was moved by around 20 km to the west. When the so-called &quot;mistake&quot; (today regarded rather as sabotage within British ministry structures) became obvious to negotiators, Stalin refused to correct the mistaken line. Despite multiple and desperate appeals from Polish citizens of Grodno, the whole Grodno region, including the Sapotskin Triangle (ethnically Polish till today), was incorporated to the Soviet Belarus and many Poles emigrated or were expelled.

In 1944, the Belastok Region was dissolved and the Grodno region was established.

Since 1991, the Grodno region constitutes one of the six regions of independent Belarus.

==Heritage and tourism==
The main tourist attractions in the region are numerous old architectural constructions such as castles in Mir, Lida, and Novogrudok. A part of the Białowieża Forest is situated here, but the tourist excursions start from the Brest region part of the National Park. Zhyrovichy Monastery is also a destination for religious travellers.

The Mir Castle Complex and Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. There are also sites from the Belarusian cultural heritage list, such as the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua in Kamienka; St. Francis Xavier Cathedral in Grodno; St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Slonim; and the Church of the Holy Trinity in Hyervyaty. Two castles dating from the 14th to 18th centuries are located in Grodno on the steep right bank of the Neman. One of the city&#x27;s surviving masterpieces is the 12th century Orthodox Church of St Boris &amp; St Gleb (Kalozhskaya Church), which is the second oldest in Belarus. There is a museum dedicated to poet Adam Mickiewicz in his childhood home in Novogrudok.

There are about 45 travel agencies in Grodno region, half of them provide agent activity, the other half are tour operators.

==Demographics==
The province covers an area of 25,100 km2 and has a population of 1,065,100, giving a population density of 42/km2. About 63.5% live in cities and towns, while 36.5% live in rural areas. Females account for 53% of the region&#x27;s population and men 47%. There are about 310,000 children under 19, and about 240,000 people aged 60 or over as of 2025.

Nowadays, Belarusians account for 62.3% of the population. The region is a home to significant minority populations.

<doc id="215316" wikidata="Q2418926" url="?curid=215316" title="Planet of the Apes (novel)">
<text>La Planète des singes, known in English as Planet of the Apes in the US and Monkey Planet in the UK, is a 1963 science fiction novel by French author Pierre Boulle. It was adapted into the 1968 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, launching the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; media franchise.

The novel tells the tale of three human explorers from Earth who visit a planet orbiting the star Betelgeuse, in which great apes are the dominant intelligent and civilized species, whereas humans are reduced to a savage animal-like state.

==Plot==
In a frame story, a rich couple sailing in space, Jinn and Phyllis, rescue and translate a manuscript from a floating bottle.

The manuscript was written by Ulysse Mérou, a French journalist who, in 2500, was invited by Professor Antelle to accompany him and his disciple, physician Arthur Levain, to Betelgeuse. Because of time dilation, centuries pass on Earth during their two years in transit. They land their shuttle on a temperate, lushly forested planet which they name &quot;Soror&quot; (Latin for &quot;sister&quot;). Attracted by a naked &quot;golden&quot; woman whom they call Nova, they swim below a waterfall. She is frightened by their pet chimpanzee, Hector, and strangles it. Her tribe, who exhibit the behavior of dumb animals, wreck the newcomers&#x27; clothing and shuttle.

Gorillas, dressed as big-game hunters, attack the tribe with firearms. Many are killed including Arthur. Ulysse is captured and brought to a city populated by apes. The apes smoke tobacco, photograph their hunting trophies, drink through straws, and appear civilized. Their society is divided into three strata: militaristic gorillas as police and soldiers, conservative orangutans as politicians and religious authorities, and liberal chimpanzees as scientists.

In an urban biological research facility, Ulysse recognizes conditioning methods being used on captured humans. He is mated with Nova. Curious chimpanzee researcher Zira takes an interest in his geometric drawings and his ability to speak a few simian words. With help from Zira&#x27;s fiancé, Cornélius, Ulysse makes a speech in front of several thousand apes. He is granted freedom, social prestige, and tailored clothing. Antelle reverts to primitive humanity in the zoo and is moved to the laboratory for safety, where he is mated to a young female.

Cornélius, an archaeologist, excavates an ancient human city and invites Ulysse. An unconscious human lab subject recites from genetic memory the events that led to the fall of human civilization: humans tamed apes and used them as servants. As apes learned to talk, a cerebral laziness took hold of the humans. Apes took over human homes, driving the humans into camps outside of the cities. In the final memory, apes attacked the last human camp.

Nova bears Ulysse a son named Sirius who walks and talks at three months. Fearing for their lives, they take the place of the human test subjects in a space flight experiment. Because all humans look alike to apes, Ulysse and Nova escape without notice and rendezvous with the orbiting ship. Ulysse programs the ship back to Earth. As they fly over Paris, Orly Airport and the Eiffel Tower look the same. When they land, however, they are greeted by a field officer in a jeep who is a gorilla. Horrified, Ulysse and Nova take off in their ship, leaving Earth behind. Ulysse then writes his manuscript as a record of what has happened, places it in a bottle, and casts it into space.

In the frame story, it is revealed that Jinn and Phyllis are chimpanzees. They discard Ulysse&#x27;s story as fantasy because they find the idea of intelligent humans unbelievable.

==Publication history==
The novel was published in France in 1963 by Éditions Julliard.

The first English language version, with a translation by Xan Fielding, was published in the United States by Vanguard Press in June 1963 under the title &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

In January 1964, it was published in the United Kingdom as &quot;Monkey Planet&quot; by Secker &amp; Warburg of London, then re-issued as &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; in August 1973 to tie it in to the film franchise it inspired.

The first paperback edition was published in the US in March 1964 by Signet / New American Library.

In May 1964, &quot;Saga: The Magazine For Men&quot; printed an abridged version of the novel.

==Adaptations==
Following the 1968 1968 film adpatation novel was spun off into the titular [Planet of the Apes|media franchise]]. An earlier draft of the 1968 film&#x27;s screenplay, authored by &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; creator Rod Serling more closely adapted the novel in terms of the imagery of the ape society. A comics adaptation of this version appeared as &quot;Planet of the Apes: Visionaries&quot;. 

A second adaptation of the book was released in 2001. In essence, it remade the 1968 film, though the ending of this adaptation more closely reflected the ending of the original novel.

<text>Volyn Oblast () or simply Volyn (), is an oblast (province) in northwestern Ukraine. It borders Rivne Oblast to the east, Lviv Oblast to the south, Poland to the west and Belarus to the north. Its administrative centre is Lutsk. Kovel is the westernmost town and the last station in Ukraine on the rail line running from Kyiv to Warsaw. The population is 

==History==


Volyn was once part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; before becoming an independent local principality and an integral part of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, one of Kievan Rus&#x27; successor states. In the 15th century, the area came under the control of the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in 1569 passing over to Poland and then in 1795, until World War I, to the Russian Empire where it was a part of the Volynskaya Guberniya. In the interwar period, most of the territory, organized as Wołyń Voivodeship was under Polish control.

In 1939 when Poland was invaded and divided by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union following the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, Volyn was joined to Soviet Ukraine, and on December 4, 1939, the oblast was organized.

Many Ukrainians rejoiced at the &quot;reunification&quot;, but the Polish minority suffered a cruel fate. Thousands of Poles, especially retired Polish officers and intelligentsia were deported to Siberia and other areas in the depths of the Soviet Union. A high proportion of these deportees died in the extreme conditions of Soviet labour camps and most were never able to return to Volyn again.

In 1941 Volyn along with the Soviet Union was invaded by the Nazi Germany&#x27;s Barbarossa Offensive. Nazis completed their holocaust of the Jews of Volhynia in late 1942.

Partisan activity started in Volyn in 1941, soon after German occupation. Partisans were involved in the Rail War against German supply lines and were known for their efficiency in gathering intelligence and for sabotage. The region formed the basis of several networks and many members of the local population served with the partisans. The Poles in the area became part of the Polish Home Army, which often undertook operations with the partisan movement.

UPA initially supported Nazi Germany which had in turn supported them with financing and weaponry before the start of World War II. Many served in the various RONA and SS units. Once they became disillusioned with the Nazi program, they independently began to target all non-Ukrainians (Poles, Jews, Russians, among others) for extermination. Some 30,000 to 60,000 Poles, Czechs, remaining Jews, and Ukrainians who tried to help others escape (Polish sources gave even higher figures) and later, around 2,000 or more Ukrainians were killed in retaliation (see Massacres of Poles in Volhynia).

In January 1944 the Red Army recaptured the territory from the Nazis.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II the Polish-Soviet border was redrawn based on the Curzon line. Volyn, along with the neighbouring provinces became an integral part of the Ukrainian SSR. Most Poles who remained in the eastern region were forced to leave to the Recovered Territories of western Poland (the former easternmost provinces of Germany) whose German population had been expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

The area underwent rapid industrialisation including the construction of the Lutsk automobile factory (LuAZ). Nevertheless, the area remains one of the most rural throughout the former Soviet Union.

<doc id="215320" wikidata="Q5169254" url="?curid=215320" title="Copyright law of Hong Kong">
<text>[[Copyright]] law in [[Hong Kong]] to a great extent follows the English model. The Basic Law of Hong Kong, its constitutional document, guarantees a high degree of autonomy and continuation of laws previously in force after its reunification with Mainland China. Hong Kong therefore continues to maintain a separate intellectual property regime from Mainland China. 

== Background ==
Article 139 and 140 of the Basic Law specifically deal with the protection of copyright in Hong Kong.

Article 139

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, formulate policies on science and technology and protect by law achievements in scientific and technological research, patents, discoveries and inventions.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, decide on the scientific and technological standards and specifications applicable in Hong Kong. 
Article 140

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, formulate policies on culture and protect by law the achievements and the lawful rights and interests of authors in their literary and artistic creation.

== Open-qualification system ==

Apart from general substantive criteria, for Copyright to subsist in a work, the statutory requirements with respect to qualification for copyright protection in s 177 must be met (Copyright Ordinance s 2(3)).

Hong Kong has broad copyright protection thanks to its open-qualification system under Copyright Ordinance ss177(1)(a), 177(1)(b) and 178. It means that no requirements of nationality or other status of the author, or of the work&#x27;s place of first publication need to be satisfied before a work is eligible for protection. Works transmitted over Internet, radio, televisions are all under protection (ss26 and 177(1)(c)).

Nonetheless, Copyright Ordinance s 180(1) allows the Chief Executive to deny or limit copyright protection for works originating in non-reciprocating jurisdictions.

== Copyright Ordinance ==

The Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), which became effective on 27 June 1997, is Hong Kong&#x27;s first purely local copyright law. However, the Copyright Act in 1956 of the United Kingdom will continue to apply to the protection of copyright of works created before 27 June 1997.

== Categories of copyright works ==

Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528) s 2(i)(a) protects 9 categories of copyrighted works:

* literary works
* dramatic works
* musical works
* artistic works
* sound recordings
* films
* broadcasts
* cable programmes
* typographical arrangement of published editions

== Criteria of claiming copyright protection ==

In order to successfully claim for copyright protection, 3 criteria must be satisfied: (1) the subject matter must be a &#x27;work&#x27;; (2) the work must fall within 1 of the 9 categories stated in s.2(1) of the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance; and (3) the work must be original if the subject matter is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.

== Duration of copyright ==

S.17 to 21 of the Copyright Ordinance deal with the duration of copyright works. The author of the work is deemed to be the person who creates the work (with exceptions for commissioned works and employee works). S.17(1) to (5) states that the duration of copyright of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works is the life of the author plus 50 years, or 50 years from the end of the year in which the work was first created or made available to the public if the identity of the author is not known.

Except for typographical arrangement of published editions, the duration of copyright in other works is also 50 years from certain events specified in the Copyright Ordinance.

The duration of copyright in typographical arrangement of published editions is 25 years from the year of first publication, according to S.21 of the Copyright Ordinance.

== Moral rights ==

The Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance Pt II Div IV (ss 89–100) recognizes the following two types of moral rights (&quot;droit d&#x27;auteur&quot;) in favour of the author, director or commissioner of the work regardless of whether he is the owner of the copyright: (i) Right to be identified as author or director (Copyright Ordinance s 89); and (ii) Right to object to derogatory treatment of work Copyright Ordinance s 92.

== Controversies in criminalising the copying of materials ==

Controversial changes criminalising the copying of materials in the course of trade were introduced in 2000: insofar as they affect printed matter, these were quickly suspended following an outcry from educational groups and consumer groups. The suspension, provided in the Copyright (Suspension of Amendments) Ordinance 2001, will expire on 31 July 2004. Hong Kong is currently unique in the common law world for treating copying infringing materials differently between printed and non-printed materials.

== Administration of copyright laws ==

Copyright laws are administered by the Intellectual Property Department of the Hong Kong Government.

<text>The decade of the 2000s in film involved many significant developments in the filmmaking industries around the world, especially in the technologies used. Building on advancements from the 1990s, computers were widely utilized to create effects that would have previously been more expensive and time-consuming, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in &quot;Cast Away&quot; to the vast battle scenes in &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels.

== Trends ==
* The 2000s saw the resurgence of several genres. Fantasy film franchises dominated the box office with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy (beginning in 1999), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, etc. Comic book superhero films became a blockbuster subgenre following the releases of &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;; culminating in the unprecedented achievements of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; both in terms of revenue and acclaim. &quot;Gladiator&quot; sparked the revival of historical epics set in ancient times (e.g., &quot;300&quot;), and the Bollywood-inspired &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; did the same for live action musical films in the Western world (e.g., &quot;Chicago&quot;). Hong Kong fight choreographers like Yuen Woo-ping continued their influence in Hollywood with such martial arts films as &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;, even leading to the spread of wire fu into other subgenres alongside filmmaker John Woo&#x27;s gun fu from the likes of &quot;&quot;.
* Certain film categories that were generally not popular in North America became more attractive to western moviegoers. Subtitled non-English language films such as &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, and &quot;Apocalypto&quot;; as well as feature-length documentaries like &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;, and &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot;; ended up being very successful.
* Computer animation replaced traditional animation as the dominant technique for animated pictures in American cinema, especially after the release of &quot;Shrek&quot;, which is the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Further extending to the exploration of motion capture technology in such films as Robert Zemeckis&#x27; &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. However, hand-drawn anime films also gained more exposure outside of Japan with the releases of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, and &quot;Ponyo&quot;; while stop-motion films earned significant audience interest thanks to &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, and &quot;Coraline&quot;. DreamWorks Animation was the top animation studio of the decade, with Pixar and 20th Century Fox Animation following close behind (the latter after Fox Animation Studios was shut down on October 31, 2000).
* Major film studios started to focus their budgets on established titles with built-in fandoms to lower the risk of commercial failures and maximize financial profits. Increasing the productions of sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots, adaptations, spin-offs, crossovers, and so on; often as attempts to create or revive franchises. Capitalizing especially on nostalgia induced by the likes of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, &quot;TMNT&quot;, &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, and many others. Out of the 50 highest-grossing films of the decade worldwide, only nine (of which six are animated) are not based on another property, though one of these became the top-grosser of all time: late 2009&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;.

<doc id="215339" wikidata="Q20825866" url="?curid=215339" title="Concentration (card game)">
<text>Concentration is a round game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

Concentration can be played with any number of players or as a solitaire or patience game. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows (in fact, several game shows have used its name in their titles) and can be employed as an educational game.

== Names ==
Concentration is also known by a variety of other names including Memory, Matching Pairs, Match Match, Match Up, Pelmanism, Pexeso or simply Pairs.

==Rules==
Any deck of playing cards may be used, although there are also commercial sets of cards with images. The rules given here are for a standard deck of 52 cards, which are normally laid face down in four rows of 13 cards each. The two jokers may be included for a total of six rows of nine cards each.

Additional packs can be used for added interest. Standard rules need not be followed: the cards can be spread out anywhere, such as all around a room.

In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. six of hearts and six of diamonds, queen of clubs and queen of spades, or both jokers, if used) then that player wins the pair and plays again. If they are not of the same rank and color, they are turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left. Rules can be changed here too: it can be agreed before the game starts that matching pairs be any two cards of the same rank, a color-match being unnecessary, or that the match must be both rank and card suit.

The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the person with the most pairs. There may be a tie for first place.

==Solitaire==
Concentration may be played solo either as a leisurely exercise, or with the following scoring method: play as normal, but keep track of the number of non-matching pairs turned over (this may be done using poker chips, pennies or by making marks on a sheet of paper). The object is to clear the tableau in the fewest turns, or to get the lowest possible score.

With perfect memorization and using an optimal strategy, the expected number of moves needed for a game with formula_1 cards converges to formula_2, with formula_3. For a standard deck of 52 cards, the expected value is formula_4 moves.

==Strategy==

Over the course of the game, it becomes known where certain cards are located, and so upon turning up one card, players with good memory will be able to remember where they have already seen its pair.

It is common for many players to think they know where pairs are and to turn over the one they are sure of first, then be stumped finding its mate. A better strategy is to turn over a less certain card first, so that if wrong, one knows not to bother turning a more certain card over.

An ideal strategy can be developed if we assume that players have perfect memory. For the One Flip variation below, this strategy is fairly simple. Before any turn in the game, there are &quot;t&quot; cards still in play, and &quot;n&quot; cards still in play but of known value. The current player should flip over an unknown card. If this card matches one of the known cards, the match is next chosen. Less obviously, if the card does not match any known card, one of the &quot;n&quot; known cards should still be chosen to minimize the information provided to other players. The mathematics follow:

If a remaining unknown card is chosen randomly, there is a 1/(t−1−n) chance of getting a match, but also a n/(t−1−n) chance of providing opponents with the information needed to make a match.

There are some exceptions to this rule that apply on the fringe cases, where &quot;n&quot; = 0 or 1 or towards the end of the game.
==Variations==
Many of these may be played in combination with one another:
* Any Color: A version especially good for young children where matching pairs need only be of the same rank, not the same color. When playing with jokers, these count double because they are more difficult to match.
* One Flip: Players who make a successful pair win these cards but do not go again until their next turn.
* Zebra: Pairs may only be formed by cards of the same rank, but opposite in color (so 7 of diamonds would match with a 7 of clubs or spades, but not a 7 of hearts)
* Two Decks: For a much longer game, shuffle together two 52-card decks and lay them out in 8 rows of 13 cards (9 rows of 12 cards if using jokers). Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs).
* Two Decks Duel: Duel is a two-player game where the playing field is divided into two separate parts. Each player shuffles a full 52-card deck and lays it out in 4 rows of 13 cards. The players cannot access each other&#x27;s cards. Player one starts, flipping &quot;one&quot; card face-up, then player two selects &quot;one&quot; card from his/her own side. If the pair is a match, cards are removed, if not, they are flipped back. Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs). After every turn roles are exchanged, in this case: player two flips a card and player one answers.
* Double Decker Checkerboard: For a slightly easier version of the two-pack game, use decks with different backs and shuffle them separately. Deal them out in a checkerboard pattern (red, blue, red, blue, etc.) The different backs help identify the position in the grid and significantly reduce the possibility of which cards will match.
* Fancy: The cards need not be laid out in a strict rectangular grid and many players have their own special layouts that include circular, triangular, or diamond-shaped formations. Dealers may select any layout they wish.
* Spaghetti: Same rules as standard concentration, only the cards are not laid out in neat rows. They are strewn randomly about on the floor.
* Pexeso: Played with a deck of 64 cards of square shape, which are laid out into an 8×8 square. Usually cards are designed specifically for the game of Pexeso, but at the same time there is no limitation on the content of the cards (images from a cartoon shows, photographs of a historic monuments or touristic destinations, car model of a specific automobile company, etc.). Cards are not divided into any kind of value or colour system; their content consists only of 32 pairs of identical cards.
If one of the players has a particularly good memory, she could play blindfolded. In this case, her opponent must say which cards have been turned up, turn the cards back down if she doesn&#x27;t get a pair and take the cards out for her if she does get a pair.

Concentration is not limited to playing cards. Many versions of the game that are designed for children may have different themes. In some computer versions, the cards may randomly move to increase the difficulty.

<text>The Fourth Way is spiritual teacher George Gurdjieff&#x27;s approach to human spiritual growth, developed and systematised by him over years of travel in the East (c. 1890 – 1912), and taught to followers in subsequent years. Gurdjieff&#x27;s students often refer to the Fourth Way as &quot;The Work&quot;, &quot;Work on oneself&quot;, or &quot;The System&quot;. The exact origins of many of the teachings are unknown, but various sources have been suggested.

The term &quot;Fourth Way&quot; was further used by his student P. D. Ouspensky in his lectures and writings. After Ouspensky&#x27;s death, his students published a book entitled &quot;The Fourth Way&quot; based on his lectures. According to this system, the three traditional schools, or ways, &quot;are permanent forms which have survived throughout history mostly unchanged, and are based on religion. Where schools of Fakirs, Monks and Yogis exist, they are barely distinguishable from religious schools. The fourth way differs in that &quot;it is not a permanent way. It has no specific forms or institutions and comes and goes controlled by some particular laws of its own.&quot;

The Fourth Way addresses the question of humanity&#x27;s place in the Universe and the possibilities of inner development. It emphasizes that people ordinarily live in a state referred to as a semi-hypnotic &quot;waking sleep,&quot; while higher levels of consciousness, virtue, and unity of will are possible.

The Fourth Way teaches how to increase and focus attention and energy in various ways, and to minimize daydreaming and absent-mindedness. This inner development in oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, whose aim is to transform man into &quot;what he ought to be.&quot;

==Overview==
===The teaching===
Gurdjieff said, &quot;The teaching whose theory is here being set out is completely self supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time.&quot;

The Fourth Way teaches that the soul a human individual is born with gets trapped and encapsulated by personality, and stays dormant, leaving one not really conscious, despite &quot;believing&quot; one is. A person must free the soul by following a teaching which can lead to this aim or &quot;go nowhere&quot; upon death of his body. Should a person be able to receive the teaching and find a school, upon the death of the physical body they will &quot;go elsewhere.&quot; Humans are born &quot;asleep&quot;, live in &quot;sleep&quot;, and die in &quot;sleep&quot;, only &quot;imagining&quot; that they are awake with few exceptions. The ordinary waking &quot;consciousness&quot; of human beings is not consciousness at all but merely a form of sleep.&quot;

Gurdjieff taught &quot;sacred dances&quot; or &quot;movements&quot;, now known as Gurdjieff movements, which were performed together as a group. 

Ouspensky documented Gurdjieff as saying that &quot;two or three thousand years ago there were yet other ways which no longer exist and the ways then in existence were not so divided, they stood much closer to one another. The fourth way differs from the old and the new ways by the fact that it is never a permanent way. It has no definite forms and there are no institutions connected with it.&quot; Ouspensky quotes Gurdjieff that there are fake schools and that &quot;It is impossible to recognize a wrong way without knowing the right way. This means that it is no use troubling oneself how to recognize a wrong way. One must think of how to find the right way.&quot;

===Assessment and analysis / after Gurdjieff&#x27;s death===
Gurdjieff&#x27;s followers believed he was a spiritual master, a human being who is fully awake or enlightened. He was also seen as an esotericist or occultist. He agreed that the teaching was esoteric but claimed that none of it was veiled in secrecy but that many people lack the interest or the capability to understand it.

After Gurdjieff&#x27;s death in 1949 a variety of groups around the world have attempted to continue The Gurdjieff Work. The Gurdjieff Foundation, was established in 1953 in New York City by Jeanne de Salzmann in cooperation with other direct pupils.

He left a body of music, inspired by that which he had heard in remote monasteries and other places, which was written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, Thomas de Hartmann.

The Fourth way was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, according to Jose Tirado, and Chatral Rinpoche alleged that Gurdjieff spent several years in a Buddhist monastery in the Swat valley.

==Teachings and teaching methods==

===Basis of teachings===

* Present here now
* We do not remember ourselves
* Conscious labour – is an action where someone who is performing an act is present to what is being done; not absentminded. At the same time to strive to perform the act more efficiently.
* Intentional suffering – is the act of struggling against automatism such as daydreaming, pleasure, food (eating for reasons other than real hunger), etc. In Gurdjieff&#x27;s book &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; he states that &quot;the greatest &#x27;intentional suffering&#x27; can be obtained in our presences by compelling ourselves to endure the displeasing manifestations of others toward ourselves&quot; According to Gurdjieff, conscious labour and intentional suffering were the basis of all evolution of man.
* Self-Observation – observation of one&#x27;s behavior and habits. To observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judging or analyzing what is observed.
* The Need for Effort – Gurdjieff emphasized that awakening results from consistent, prolonged effort. Such efforts may be made as an act of will after one is already exhausted.
* The Many &#x27;I&#x27;s – this indicates fragmentation of the psyche, the different feelings and thoughts of &#x27;I&#x27;: I think, I want, I know best, I prefer, I am happy, I am hungry, I am tired, etc. These have nothing in common with one another and are unaware of each other, arising and vanishing for short periods of time. Hence someone usually has no unity in the self, wanting one thing now and another, perhaps contradictory, thing later.

===Centers===
Gurdjieff classified plants as having one center, animals two and humans three. Centers refer to apparatuses within a being that dictate specific organic functions. There are three main centers in a man: intellectual, emotional and physical, and two higher centers: higher emotional and higher intellectual.

Body, Essence and Personality

Gurdjieff divided people&#x27;s being into &quot;Essence&quot; and &quot;Personality&quot;.

*Essence – is a &quot;natural part of a person&quot; or &quot;what he is born with&quot;; this is the part of a being which is said to have the ability to evolve.
*Personality – is everything artificial that he has &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;seen&quot;.

Cosmic Laws

Gurdjieff focused on two main cosmic laws, the &quot;Law of Three&quot; and the &quot;Law of Seven&quot; .

*The Law of Seven is described by Gurdjieff as &quot;the first fundamental cosmic law&quot;. This law is used to explain processes. The basic use of the law of seven is to explain why nothing in nature and in life constantly occurs in a straight line, that is to say that there are always ups and downs in life which occur lawfully. Examples of this can be noticed in athletic performances, where a high ranked athlete always has periodic downfalls, as well as in nearly all graphs that plot topics that occur over time, such as the economic graphs, population graphs, death-rate graphs and so on. All show parabolic periods that keep rising and falling. Gurdjieff claimed that since these periods occur lawfully based on the law of seven that it is possible to keep a process in a straight line if the necessary shocks were introduced at the right time. A piano keyboard is an example of the law of seven, as the seven notes of the major scale correspond exactly to it.
*The Law of Three is described by Gurdjieff as &quot;the second fundamental cosmic law&quot;. This law states that every whole phenomenon is composed of three separate sources, which are Active, Passive and Reconciling or Neutral. This law applies to everything in the universe and humanity, as well as all the structures and processes. The Three Centers in a human, which Gurdjieff said were the Intellectual Centre, the Emotional Centre and the Moving Centre, are an expression of the law of three. Gurdjieff taught his students to think of the law of three forces as essential to transforming the energy of the human being. The process of transformation requires the three actions of , denial and . This law of three separate sources can be considered modern &quot;interpretation&quot; of early Hindu Philosophy of Gunas, We can see this as Chapters 3, 7, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of Bhagavad Gita discuss &quot;Guna in their verses.&quot;

How the &quot;Law of Seven&quot; and &quot;Law of Three&quot; function together is said to be illustrated on the Fourth Way Enneagram, a nine-pointed symbol which is the central glyph of Gurdjieff&#x27;s system.

===Use of symbols===
In his explanations Gurdjieff often used different symbols such as the Enneagram and the Ray of Creation. Gurdjieff said that &quot;the enneagram is a universal symbol. All knowledge can be included in the enneagram and with the help of the enneagram it can be interpreted... A man may be quite alone in the desert and he can trace the enneagram in the sand and in it read the eternal laws of the universe. And every time he can learn something new, something he did not know before.&quot; The Enneagram is often studied in contexts that do not include other elements of Fourth Way teaching.

==Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man==
Having migrated for four years after escaping the Russian Revolution with dozens of followers and family members, Gurdjieff settled in France and established his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at the Château Le Prieuré at Fontainebleau-Avon in October 1922. The institute was an esoteric school based on Gurdjieff&#x27;s Fourth Way teaching. After nearly dying in a car crash in 1924, he recovered and closed down the institute. He began writing &quot;All and Everything&quot;. From 1930, Gurdjieff made visits to North America where he resumed his teachings.

Ouspensky relates that in the early work with Gurdjieff in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Gurdjieff forbade students from writing down or publishing anything connected with Gurdjieff and his ideas. Gurdjieff said that students of his methods would find themselves unable to transmit correctly what was said in the groups. Later, Gurdjieff relaxed this rule, accepting students who subsequently published accounts of their experiences in the Gurdjieff work.

<doc id="215354" wikidata="Q2478280" url="?curid=215354" title="Ormus">
<text>The Kingdom of Ormus (also known as Hormoz or Hormuz; ; ) was located in the eastern side of the Persian Gulf and extended as far as Bahrain in the west at its zenith. The Kingdom was established in the 11th century initially as a dependency of the Kerman Seljuk Sultanate, and later as an autonomous tributary of the Salghurid Turkmens and the Ilkhanates. In its last phase Ormus became a client state of the Portuguese Empire in the East. Most of its territory was eventually annexed by the Safavid Empire in the 17th century. It bordered Laristan, with whom it was regularly at odds.

The island was a major economic base of economic exchanges and marine trade as an important port between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. This port was originally located on the southern coast of Iran to the east of the Strait of Hormuz, near the modern city of Minab, and was later relocated to the island of Jarun which came to be known as Hormuz Island, which is located near the modern city of Bandar-e Abbas.

==Etymology==

Popular etymology derives &quot;Hormuz&quot;, being the Middle Persian pronunciation of the Zoroastrian god Ahuramazda. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the name derives from Hur-Muz &#x27;Place of Dates&#x27;. Yet another possibility is that it comes from ὅρμος &quot;hormos&quot;, the Greek word for &#x27;cove, bay&#x27;. The name of the actual urban settlement that acted as the capital of the Old Hormoz Kingdom was also given as Naband.

==Old Hormuz==

The earliest period of the history of the kings of Hormuz starts with the emigration of Muhammad Diramku from Oman to the Iranian coast in the 11th century and lasted until the transfer of the capital to Hormuz island at the turn of the 14th century, also during this period Hormuz enjoyed a long period of autonomy under the suzerainty of kings of Iran from the foundation of the kingdom in the 11th century to the coming of the Portuguese. Notable events of this period include power struggles between the numerous emirs of Hormuz and the surrounding region and the sustaining of the economic status of Hormuz.

Hormuz was ruled by the descendants of Muhammad Diramku (Deramkub &quot;Dirham minter&quot;) who founded the kingdom as a dependency of the Kingdom of Kerman after the collapse of the Buyid kingdom, reaching its apogee under the rule of the Mongol dynasty of the Ilkhanids. In the medieval period, the kingdom was well known as an international emporium controlling both sides of the Persian Gulf and much of the coastal area of the Arabian Sea.

&quot;It was during the reign of Mir Bahrudin Ayaz Seyfin, fifteenth king of Hormoz, that the Seljuks raided Kerman and from there to Hormuz. The wealth of Hormuz attracted raids so often that the inhabitants sought refuge off the mainland and initially moved to the island of Qeshm. Mir Bahrudin then visited the island of Jerun and obtained it from Neyn (Na&#x27;im), King of Keys (Kish), to whom all the islands in the area belonged. After undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage, Mir Bahrudin became widely known as Haji Bahrudin in the lands of Hormuz.&quot;

These shifts in power marked the end of the [Persian] Gulf&#x27;s heyday, but the island ports of Qays and then the mainland port of Hormoz (at first tributary to Persia) became renowned entrepôts. The Hurmuzî rulers developed Qalhat on the Omani coast in order to control both sides of the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Later, in 1300, the Hurmuzî merchants cast off Persian overlordship, and reorganized their entrepot on the island also called Hurmuz and there amassed legendary wealth. The relationship between the Nabâhina and the Hurmuzîs is obscure&quot;.
==New Hormuz==

The start of the reign of Emir Rukn al-Din Mahmud Qalhati (r. 1249–1286) saw the beginning of a new period in the history of Ormus. This period was generally characterised as seeing Ormus cutting dependence ties with Kerman and the Salghurids (located in Fars) and instead projecting power to the direction of Bahrain and Oman.

At the time of the Ilkhanid competition with the Chaghatais, the old city of Hormuz, also known as Nabands and Dewankhana, was abandoned by its inhabitants. Instead, in 1301, the inhabitants, led by the king Baha ud-Din Ayaz and his wife Bibi Maryam, moved to the neighbouring island of Jerun.

In the early 15th century, Hormuz was one the kingdoms that was visited by the Chinese expeditionary fleet commanded by Admiral Zheng He during the Ming treasure voyages and was the final destination of the fleet during the fourth voyage. Ma Huan, an interpreter serving in the crew, described Hormuz society in a positive light in the &quot;Yingya Shenglan&quot;, writing for example about the people that &quot;the limbs and faces of the people are refined and fair [...] and they are stalwart and fine-looking; their clothing and hats are handsome, distinctive and elegant.&quot; Fei Xin, another crew member, made an account of Hormuz in the &quot;Xingcha Shenglan&quot;. It included, for instance, observations suggesting that Hormuz society had a high standard of living, writing that &quot;the lower classes are wealthy&quot;, and on local dressing habits such as the long robes worn by both men and women, the veils that women wore over their head and face when going out, and the jewels worn by the well-to-do.

Being known as an international emporium and well known in Europe as a commercial hub, its success in fact led to its fame, prompting the Portuguese to launch attacks on it and conquer it in the early 16th century.

==Decline during the Portuguese conquest==

In September 1507, the Portuguese Afonso de Albuquerque landed on the island, the Portuguese occupied Ormuz from 1515 to 1622.

As vassals of the Portuguese state, the Kingdom of Ormus jointly participated in the 1521 invasion of Bahrain that ended Jabrid rule of the Persian Gulf archipelago. The Jabrid ruler was nominally a vassal of Ormus, but the Jabrid King, Muqrin ibn Zamil had refused to pay the tribute Ormus demanded, prompting the invasion under the command of the Portuguese conqueror, António Correia. In the fighting for Bahrain, most of the combat was carried out by Portuguese troops, while the Ormusi admiral, Reis Xarafo, looked on.The Portuguese ruled Bahrain through a series of Ormusi governors. However, the Sunni Ormusi were not popular with Bahrain&#x27;s Shia population which suffered religious disadvantages, prompting rebellion. In one case, the Ormusi governor was crucified by rebels, and Portuguese rule came to an end in 1602 after the Ormusi governor, who was a relative of the Ormusi king, started executing members of Bahrain&#x27;s leading families.

The kings of Hormuz under Portuguese rule were reduced to vassals of the Portuguese empire in India, mostly controlled from Goa. The archive of correspondence between the kings and local rulers of Hormuz, and some of its governors and people, and the kings of Portugal, contain the details of the kingdom&#x27;s disintegration and the independence of its various parts. They show the attempts by rulers such as Kamal ud-Din Rashed trying to gain separate favour with the Portuguese in order to guarantee their own power. This reflects in the gradual independence of Muscat, previously a dependency of Hormuz, and its rise as one of the successor states to Hormuz.

After the Portuguese made several abortive attempts to seize control of Basra, the Safavid ruler Abbas I of Persia conquered the kingdom in 1622 with the help of the English, and expelled the Portuguese from the rest of the Persian Gulf, with the exception of Muscat. The Portuguese returned to the Persian Gulf in the following year as allies of Afrasiyab (the Pasha of Basra) against the Persians. Afrasiyab was formerly an Ottoman vassal but had been effectively independent since 1612. They never returned to Ormus.

In the mid-17th century it was captured by the Imam of Muscat, but was subsequently recaptured by Persians. Today, it is part of the Iranian province of Hormozgan.

==Accounts of Ormus society==

Situated between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, Ormus was a &quot;by-word for wealth and luxury&quot;, perhaps best captured in the Arab saying: &quot;If all the world were a golden ring, Ormus would be the jewel in it&quot;. The city was also known for its licentiousness according to accounts by Portuguese visitors; Duarte Barbosa, one of the first Portuguese to travel to Ormuz in the early 16th century found:

This theme is also strong in Henry James Coleridge&#x27;s account of Ormus in his life of the Navarrese missionary, St Francis Xavier, who visited Ormus on his way to Japan:

Abbe Guillaume Thomas François Raynal is quoted as giving the following account of Hormoz: Hormoz became the capital of an empire which comprehended a considerable part of Arabia on one side, and Persia on the other. At the time of the arrival of the foreign merchants, it afforded a more splendid and agreeable scene than any city in the East. Persons from all parts of the globe exchanged their commodities and transacted their business with an air of politeness and attention, which are seldom seen in other places of trade. The streets were covered with mats and in some places with carpet, and the linen awnings which were suspended from the tops of the houses, prevented any inconvenience from the heat of the sun. India cabinets ornamented with gilded vases, or china filled with flowering shrubs or aromatic plants adorned their apartments. Camels laden with water were stationed in the public squares. Persian wines, perfumes, and all the delicacies of the table were furnished in great abundance, and they had the music of the East in its highest perfection ... In short, universal opulence, an extensive commerce, politeness in the men and gallantry in the women, united all their attractions to make this city the seat of pleasure.

==Depiction in literature==
Ormus is mentioned in a passage from John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (Book II, lines 1–5) where Satan&#x27;s throne &quot;Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind&quot;, which Douglas Brooks states is Milton linking Ormus to the &quot;sublime but perverse orient&quot;. It is also mentioned in Andrew Marvell&#x27;s poem &#x27;Bermudas&#x27;, where pomegranates are described as &quot;jewels more rich than Ormus shows.&quot; In Hart Crane&#x27;s sonnet &quot;To Emily Dickinson&quot;, it appears in the couplet: &quot;Some reconcilement of remotest mind– / Leaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.&quot; The closet drama Alaham by Fulke Greville is set in Ormus. The kingdom of Ormus, referred to as &#x27;Ormuz&#x27;, is described in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel Wolf Hall as &quot;the driest kingdom in the world, where there are no trees and no crop but salt. Stand at its centre, and you look over thirty miles in all directions of ashy plain: beyond which lies the seashore, encrusted with pearls.&quot;

<text>Henry Maurice Dunlop Nicoll (19 July 1884 – 30 August 1953) was a Scottish neurologist, psychiatrist, author and noted Fourth Way esoteric teacher. He is best known for his &quot;Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky&quot;, a five-volume collection of more than 500 talks given and distributed to his study groups in and around London from March 1941 to August 1953.

== Life and work ==
Nicoll was born at the manse in Kelso, Scotland, the son of William Robertson Nicoll, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and renowned man of letters. From 1903 to 1906 Nicoll studied science at Gonville &amp; Caius College in Cambridge University earning First Class Honours in the Natural Science Tripos. From 1906 to 1910 he attended St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital qualifying in medicine as a surgeon and neurologist. He served as ship&#x27;s-surgeon for a brief stint to and from Buenos Aires before proceeding to tour the European hotbeds of the New Psychology, Vienna, Berlin, and finally, Zürich, where he met and became a close friend and colleague of C.G. Jung in 1912.

Jung legitimised Nicoll&#x27;s belief in the mind-body dynamic by curing him of a stammer. Nicoll spent the next decade with his father-figure even making Jung godfather of his only child, Jane, in 1921.

In 1917 Nicoll published his first non-fiction monograph, &quot;Dream Psychology&quot;, the &quot;First didactic presentation of Jung&#x27;s psychology,&quot; according to the Jungian scholar Sonu Shamdasani.

In addition to his personal friendship with Jung, from 1912 through 1921 Nicoll published a number of articles on Jung&#x27;s theories in professional journals, so it would not have been out of character for Nicole to have served as a Jungian proxy at his Harley Street, London, medical practice. Following his service as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War, where he first treated the wounded at the Gallipoli, Suvla Bay offensive, and after recovering from dysentery, he arrived with the 32nd Field Hospital of the 10th Irish division and did the same at the Siege of Kut, in Mesopotamia.

In October 1921 he met P. D. Ouspensky, a student and then a teacher of George Gurdjieff&#x27;s Fourth Way. Despite the recent birth of his only child, Jane, the following spring Nicoll sold his Harley Street medical practice within a month after meeting the “Tiger of Turkestan” (Gurdjieff’s nickname), and by that fall he, his wife Catherine, Jane, and the child&#x27;s nanny arrived at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man outside Paris. In the summer of 1923, when Gurdjieff closed down his institute, Nicoll joined Ouspensky&#x27;s group. In 1931 he followed Ouspensky&#x27;s advice and started his own study groups in England. Many of these talks were recorded verbatim and documented in a six-volume series of texts compiled in his book series &quot;Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky&quot;.

Nicoll is best known as a teacher and practitioner of the Fourth Way or esoteric Christianity of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, but as his authorised biographer Beryl Pogson notes he privately read Swedenborg and the Gospels. In fact, his synthesis of the aforementioned esoteric Christianity with the New Christianity as especially expounded by Swedenborg in his multi-volume exegetical work Arcana Coelestia resulted in what could be described as a mystical Christianity unique to the Fourth Way tradition if not all of Christian mysticism.

His early tutelage under Jung led to a lifelong interest in and self-application of dream interpretation. His associated reflections on Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Alchemy, Sufism, Greek philosophy, Jakob Böhme, William Blake, along with variety of Indian and Chinese traditions (not to mention an assortment of individuals throughout history who have commented on consciousness) are as a whole present in &quot;Living Time and the Integration of the Life&quot; (completed by WWII but not published until 1952); yet both his published works and private papers have for the most part been publicly commented upon only infrequently.

<text>In the x86 assembly language, the codice_1 instruction performs an unconditional jump. Such an instruction transfers the flow of execution by changing the program counter. There are a number of different opcodes that perform a jump; depending on whether the processor is in real mode or protected mode, and an override instruction is used, the instructions may take 16-bit, 32-bit, or segment:offset pointers. 

There are many different forms of jumps: relative, conditional, absolute and register-indirect jumps.

The following examples illustrate:
# a relative jump with a 16-bit pointer;
# a long jump (inter-segment), a relative jump with a 32-bit pointer;
# and a register-indirect absolute jump using the EAX register.
(Note that although the first and second jumps are relative, commonly the destination address is shown instead of the relative offset as encoded in the opcode.)

Example one: Load IP with the new value codice_2, then load CS with codice_3 and IP with codice_4.

JMP 0x89AB
JMP 0xACDC:0x5578
Example two: Load EIP with the value codice_5, only in protected mode or unreal mode.

JMP 0x56789AB1
Example three: Jump to the value stored in the EAX register, only in protected mode.

JMP EAX


The codice_1 (Jump) instruction transfers the program&#x27;s control to a specified location in the code. Unlike function calls, it doesn’t save return information. Instead, it directs execution to a target address, which can be:

* An immediate value,
* A general-purpose register, or
* A memory location.

== Types of Jumps ==
The codice_1 instruction supports four types of jumps:

# Short Jump
#* A jump within the range of -128 to +127 bytes relative to the current instruction pointer (codice_8).
# Near Jump
#* A jump within the current code segment (pointed to by the codice_9 register).
#* The target can be an absolute offset (address within the segment) or a relative offset (distance from the current codice_8).
# Far Jump
#* A jump to a different code segment, but at the same privilege level.
#* Typically used in intersegment jumps.
# Task Switch
#* A jump to a different task, used in protected mode.
#* The codice_1 instruction can reference a task gate or directly specify a Task State Segment (TSS).

== Short and Near Jumps ==

=== Short Jump ===

* The relative offset is an 8-bit signed value (codice_12), specifying the distance from the current codice_8.
* The codice_9 register remains unchanged.

=== Near Jump ===

* The target is within the current code segment and can be:
** An absolute offset (loaded directly into codice_8).
** A relative offset (codice_16 or codice_17), calculated from the current codice_8.

Operand Size

* For absolute offsets:
** 16-bit mode clears the upper two bytes of codice_8.
** 32-bit mode allows the full offset range.
* For relative offsets, the size (codice_20) depends on the instruction opcode and operand size attribute.

== Far Jumps ==

=== Real-Address or Virtual-8086 Mode ===

* The target address includes both:
** A segment selector (loaded into codice_9), and
** An offset (loaded into codice_8).

The target can be specified:

# Directly: Encoded as a pointer (codice_23 or codice_24) in the instruction.
# Indirectly: Stored in memory (codice_25 or codice_26) and fetched by the instruction.

=== Protected Mode ===
In protected mode, far jumps can be used for:

# Switching Code Segments
#* A jump to a conforming or non-conforming code segment.
#* The codice_9 register is updated with the target segment selector, and codice_8 is updated with the offset.
# Using a Call Gate
#* The target operand specifies a call gate descriptor, which defines the segment and offset to jump to.
#* This approach allows indirect jumps and is preferred for transitions between 16-bit and 32-bit segments.
# Performing a Task Switch
#* The target specifies a task gate or directly references a TSS.
#* The task&#x27;s segment selectors (code and stack) and the codice_8 are loaded from the TSS.

== Special Notes on Task Switching ==

* When using codice_1 for task switches:
** The Nested Task (NT) flag in the codice_31 register is not set.
** The previous task link in the new TSS is not updated.
** As a result, you cannot return to the previous task using the codice_32 instruction.
** This differs from the codice_33 instruction, which enables task returns by setting the codice_34 flag and saving task link information.

<text>Kathryn Hulme (January 6, 1900 – August 25, 1981) was an American author and memoirist most noted for her novel &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot;. The book is often misunderstood to be semi-autobiographical.

==Writing==
Her 1956 book &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; was a best-selling novel which was made into an award-winning 1959 movie starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter Finch.

Another work, &quot;The Undiscovered Country: A Spiritual Adventure&quot; published by Little, Brown &amp; Co. was a description of her years as a student of mystic G. I. Gurdjieff and her eventual conversion to Catholicism. Hulme studied with Gurdjieff as part of a group of eight women known as &quot;The Rope,&quot; which included: Solita Solano, Kathryn Hulme, Alice Rohrer, Elizabeth Gordon, Louise Davidson, Georgette Leblanc, Margaret Caroline Anderson and Jane Heap

She is also the author of &quot;The Wild Place&quot;, a vivid description of her experiences as the UNRRA Director of the Polish Displaced Persons camp at Wildflecken, Germany, after World War II. This work won the Atlantic Non-Fiction Award in 1952.

It was at Wildflecken that Hulme met a Belgian nurse and former nun Marie Louise Habets, who became her lifelong companion. &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; is a slightly fictionalized biographical account of Habets&#x27; life as a nun.

In her 1938 fictionalized autobiography &quot;We Lived as Children&quot;, Hulme describes a child&#x27;s perspective of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.

<text>Earl Edwin Pitts (born September 23, 1953) is a former FBI special agent who was convicted of espionage for selling information to Soviet and Russian intelligence services.

==History==
Pitts was arrested in 1996 for selling U.S. intelligence secrets to Soviet and Russian intelligence for payments in excess of $224,000 from 1987 to 1992. In February 1997, he pleaded guilty to conspiring and attempting to commit espionage, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence.

On June 27, 1997, Earl Pitts was sentenced by a federal judge to 27 years in prison. Prosecutors had requested only 24½ years.

The FBI learned of Pitts&#x27; spying through human intelligence. His KGB handler, Alexsandr Karpov, defected to the United States and named Pitts as a Soviet mole in the FBI during his debriefings. Pitts was snared in a 16-month FBI sting that ended with his arrest while he was stationed at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The FBI caught Pitts by convincing him that the Russian government wanted to reactivate him as a spy. Pitts offered his services to the Soviets in 1987 while he was assigned to the FBI&#x27;s New York office where he was assigned to hunt and recruit KGB officers.

While working in the FBI New York office, Pitts had access to &quot;a wide range of sensitive and highly classified operations&quot; that included &quot;recruitment operations involving Russian intelligence officers, double agent operations, operations targeting Russian intelligence officers, true identities of human assets, operations against Russian illegals, defector sources, surveillance schedules of known meet sites, internal policies, documents, and procedures concerning surveillance of Russian intelligence officers, and the identification, targeting, and reporting on known and suspected KGB intelligence officers in the New York area.&quot;

During the late 1980s, Pitts met with a KGB source in multiple locations throughout New York City, including an airport and a public library. His relationship with the Russians lasted for five years. During this time period, he turned over information that included the name of an FBI agent who was working covertly on Russian intelligence matters. According to the FBI, Pitts received more than $224,000, first from the KGB First Chief Directorate and then—after the dissolution of the Soviet Union—from its successor, the SVR RF. The FBI said Pitts also turned over a secret computerized FBI list of all Soviet officials in the United States, with their known or suspected posts in Soviet intelligence agencies.

After the sting began, Pitts&#x27; ex-wife, Mary Columbaro Pitts, also a former FBI employee, told the FBI that she suspected her husband was a spy, though he never disclosed his status as a double agent to her. When he was convicted of espionage and asked why he engaged in that act, Pitts cited numerous grievances with the FBI and said he wanted to &quot;pay them back&quot;.

Pitts&#x27; plea bargain required him to submit to FBI debriefings. During one such debriefing in 1997, Pitts stated that he was not aware of any additional spies within the FBI, but he was suspicious of Robert Hanssen. The FBI did not act on Pitts&#x27; warning, however, and Hanssen&#x27;s espionage continued until 2001.

Pitts was released on December 20, 2019.

<text>The FBI Academy is the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s law enforcement training and research center near the town of Quantico in Prince William County, Virginia. The academy occupies 547 acres (221 ha) on the US Marine Corps Base Quantico. It is located 36 miles outside Washington, D.C., and is a full service national training facility. In addition to training new FBI agents at the facility, the Training Division also instructs special agents, intelligence analysts, law enforcement officers, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, and foreign partners. 

In order to be able to attend the academy and become an FBI agent, a candidate must be aged between 23 and 37, a citizen of the United States, and possess a minimum of a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

== History ==
Operated by the bureau&#x27;s Training Division, the academy was first opened for use on May 7, 1972, on of woodland. In 1933, FBI agents were granted the power to possess a firearm and to arrest, and so the academy was opened to train agents. The Marine Corps granted them access to their firing ranges in Quantico, Virginia. After outgrowing the Marine Corps firing ranges, the FBI was granted permission to build their own firing range and classroom on the base. Additional sections were added over time, including a new wing, kitchen, and basement. 

As the FBI grew, it required a larger facility. In 1965, the FBI received approval for a new complex at Quantico and construction began in 1969. The new facility opened in 1972, with more than two dozen classrooms, eight conference rooms, a large auditorium, a gym, pool, library, and a new firing range.

== Training facilities ==
Elite units such as the Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), Evidence Response Teams (ERT), Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), and about 1,000 police leaders from across the world attend the FBI Academy and utilize its training facilities to improve their skills.

The academy provides several training programs, including Firearms, Hogan&#x27;s Alley (a training complex simulating a small town), Tactical and Emergency Vehicle Operations Center (TEVOC), Survival Skills, and Law Enforcement Executive Development. To meet the needs of these training programs, the facility has a 1.1-mile-long oval road track with a precision obstacle for conducting TEVOC. Hogan&#x27;s Alley is a mock town built with the help of Hollywood set designers in order to give realistic training to agents. It helps the agents experience realistic and stressful scenarios to better prepare them for real-life situations.

The academy&#x27;s facilities include a newly renovated aquatic training center. Aquatic classes are used to boost cardio-respiratory endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, power and speed. While new agent trainees utilize the facility to receive CPR and lifesaving skills, larger units such as HRT officers receive over 450 hours of training that include advanced scuba diving, nighttime diving, rescue diving, and rescue swimming in the facilities. The FBI and DEA trainees also have classes that are focused on physical conditioning, basic water survival skills, and team work.

<text>An inchoate offense, preliminary crime, inchoate crime or incomplete crime is a crime of preparing for or seeking to commit another crime. The most common example of an inchoate offense is &quot;attempt&quot;. &quot;Inchoate offense&quot; has been defined as the following: &quot;Conduct deemed criminal without actual harm being done, provided that the harm that would have occurred is one the law tries to prevent.&quot;

==Intent==

Every inchoate crime or offense must have the &quot;mens rea&quot; of intent or of recklessness, typically intent. Absent a specific law, an inchoate offense requires that the defendant have the specific intent to commit the underlying crime. For example, for a defendant to be guilty of the inchoate crime of solicitation of murder, he or she must have intended for a person to die.

Attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation all require &quot;mens rea&quot;.

On the other hand, committing an offense under the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act merely requires &quot;knowing&quot;, that is, recklessness. Facilitation also requires &quot;believing&quot;, yet another way of saying reckless.

Intent may be distinguished from recklessness and criminal negligence as a higher &quot;mens rea&quot;.

===Proof of intent===
Specific intent may be inferred from circumstances. It may be proven by the doctrine of &quot;dangerous proximity&quot;, while the Model Penal Code requires a &quot;substantial step in a course of conduct&quot;.

==Merger doctrine==

The doctrine of merger has been abandoned in many jurisdictions in cases involving a conspiracy, allowing an accused to be convicted of both conspiracy and the principal offense. However, an accused cannot be convicted of either attempt or solicitation and the principal offense.

==Defenses==
A number of defenses are possible to the charge of an inchoate offense, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the offense.

===Impossibility===

Impossibility is no defense to the crime of attempt where the conditions creating the impossibility are unknown to the actor.

Originally at common law, impossibility was a complete defense; as it was under French law at one point. Indeed, the ruling in &quot;Collins&#x27;s Case&quot; L. and C. 471 was that an offender cannot be guilty of an attempt to steal his own umbrella when he mistakenly believes that it belongs to another. Although the &quot;moral guilt&quot; for the attempt and the actual crime were the same, there was a distinction between the harm caused by a theft and the harmlessness of an impossible act. This principle was directly overruled in England with the rulings &quot;R v Ring&quot; and &quot;R v. Brown&quot; The example from &quot;R v Brown&quot; of an attempt to steal from an empty pocket is now a classic example of illustrating the point that impossibility is no defense to the crime of attempt when the conditions creating the impossibility are unknown to the actor. This principle has been codified in the Model Penal Code:

A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime he: purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime &quot;if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be.&quot; MPC § 5.01 (1)(a) (emphasis added).
Consequently, the principle is universal in the United States either in Model Penal Code jurisdictions (40 states) or those remaining common law jurisdictions influenced by the reasoning in &quot;R v Brown&quot;.

Other cases that illustrate the case law for impossibility defenses are &quot;People v. Lee Kong&quot; (CA, 1892), &quot;State v. Mitchell&quot; (MO, 1902), and &quot;United States v. Thomas (1962)&quot;.

===Abandonment===
A defendant may plead and prove, as an affirmative defense, that they:

* Stopped all actions in furtherance of the crime or conspiracy
* Tried to stop the crime as it was ongoing
* Tried to convince the co-conspirators to halt such actions, or reported the crime to the police or other authorities

==Disputes==
===Burglaries as inchoate crimes===

There is some scholarly treatment of burglaries in American law as inchoate crimes, but this is in dispute. According to scholar Frank Schmalleger, burglaries &quot;are actually inchoate crimes in disguise.&quot;

Other scholars warn about the consequences of such a theory:

Certainly, &quot;possession of burglary tools&quot;, in those jurisdictions that criminalize that activity, creates an inchoate crime (&quot;going equipped&quot; in the UK). It is clear that:

==Examples==
Examples of inchoate offenses include conspiracy, solicitation, facilitation, misprision of felony (and misprision generally), organized crime, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and attempt, as well as some public health crimes; see the list below.

<doc id="215377" wikidata="Q209126" url="?curid=215377" title="Wexford">
<text>Wexford ( ; archaic Yola: &quot;Weiseforthe&quot;) is the county town of County Wexford, Ireland. Wexford lies on the south side of Wexford Harbour, the estuary of the River Slaney near the southeastern corner of the island of Ireland. The town is linked to Dublin by the M11/N11 National Primary Route; and to Rosslare Europort, Cork and Waterford by the N25. The national rail network connects it to Dublin and Rosslare Europort. It had a population of 21,524 according to the 2022 census.

==History==
The town was founded by the Vikings in about 800 AD. They named it &quot;Veisafjǫrðr&quot;, meaning &quot;inlet of the mudflats&quot;. In medieval times, the town was known as &quot;Weiseforthe&quot; in the Yola dialect of Middle English. This, in turn became &quot;Wexford&quot; in modern English. According to a story recorded in the &quot;dindsenchas&quot;, the town&#x27;s Irish name, &quot;Loch Garman&quot; (lake of Garman), comes from a man named &quot;Garman mac Bomma Licce&quot; who was chased to the river mouth and drowned as a consequence of stealing the queen&#x27;s crown from Temair during the feast of Samhain.

For several hundred years (from the 9th to the early 12th century), Wexford was a Viking town, a city-state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish kings of Leinster. However, in May 1169 Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster and his Norman ally Robert Fitz-Stephen besieged Wexford. The Norse inhabitants resisted fiercely until the Bishop of Ferns persuaded them to accept a settlement with Dermot.

Wexford became an Old English settlement throughout the early to late Medieval period. An Anglo-Frisian language, known as Yola, was commonly spoken in south Wexford from the time of the Norman invasion in 1169 until it began declining in the mid-19th century. While Yola was extinct by the 1870s, its last speaker, a fisherman from Kilmore Quay named Jack Devereux, died in 1998.

Compared to other parts of Ireland, the Irish language was not as widely spoken in the baronies of Forth and Bargy, which include Wexford town, from the 9th century onwards due to heavy settlement of Norse, Norman and continental Europeans. However, Leinster Irish was the main language spoken in the more northern baronies of County Wexford, and it was spoken widely during the early to late Medieval period, until its decline in the 17th century.

Following the Crusades, the Knights Templar had a presence in Wexford town. Up to the present, their name is perpetuated in the old Knights&#x27; Templars&#x27; chapel yard of St. John&#x27;s Cemetery, on Wexford&#x27;s Upper St. John&#x27;s Street. Wexford received its first charter in 1318.

County Wexford produced strong support for Confederate Ireland during the 1640s. A fleet of Confederate privateers was based in Wexford town, consisting of sailors from Flanders and Spain as well as local men. Their vessels raided English Parliamentarian shipping, giving some of the proceeds to the Confederate government in Kilkenny. As a result, the town was sacked by the English Parliamentarians during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. Many of its inhabitants were killed and much of the town was burned. In 1659 Solomon Richards was appointed Governor, but he was dismissed and imprisoned following the Restoration the next year.

Wexford&#x27;s early- and mid- 18th-century history is less frequently remembered than later periods, however, the impact of this period is evident from the architectural fabric of the town such as the gabled Dutch Billy houses such as on Main Street.

County Wexford was the centre of the 1798 rebellion against British rule, and Wexford town was held by the United Irishmen throughout the Wexford Rebellion. Nearby Scullabogue was the scene of a notorious massacre of local loyalists by the United Irishmen, and there were also executions and reprisals at Wexford Bridge.

Redmond Square, near Wexford railway station, commemorates the elder John Edward Redmond (1806–1865) who sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the city of Wexford. The inscription reads: &quot;My heart is with the city of Wexford. Nothing can extinguish that love but the cold soil of the grave.&quot; His nephew William Archer Redmond (1825–1880) sat as an MP in Isaac Butt&#x27;s Home Rule Party from 1872 until 1880. Willie Redmond sat as an MP for Wexford from 1883 until 1885. The younger John Redmond, was a devoted follower of Charles Stewart Parnell and leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party until his death in April 1918. He is interred in the Redmond family vault, at the old Knights&#x27; Templars&#x27; chapel yard of St. John&#x27;s Cemetery, Upper St. John&#x27;s Street.

&quot;Redmond Park&quot; was formally opened in May 1931 as a memorial to Willie Redmond, who died in 1917 while serving with the 16th (Irish) Division during the Messines offensive and was buried on the Western Front.

==Culture==

Wexford hosts the Wexford Opera Festival every October. Started by Dr Tom Walsh in 1951, the festival has since grown and a fireworks display is sometimes held in conjunction with the annual festival.

Wexford has a number of music and drama venues including:
* The National Opera House (formerly the Wexford Opera House), developed on the site of the historic Theatre Royal opera house;
* the Dun Mhuire Theatre, which holds community theatre events including music events and hosting shows by Oyster Lane Theatre Group and Wexford Pantomime Society;
* Wexford Arts Centre, which hosts exhibitions, theatre, music and dance events;
* St Iberius&#x27; Church (Church of Ireland), various concerts are held here.

Wexford is the home of several youth and senior theatre groups, including the &quot;Buí Bolg&quot; Street Theatre Company, Oyster Lane Theatre Group, Wexford Pantomime Society, Wexford Light Opera Society and Wexford Drama Group. In 2024, Wexford hosted the &quot;Fleadh Cheoil&quot; festival.

The National Lottery Skyfest was held in Wexford in March 2011 and included a pyrotechnic waterfall on the town&#x27;s main bridge spanning 300m. Buí Bolg also performed on the night.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, the Yola language could be heard in Wexford, and some words, phrases and place names are still used in the locality, particularly in the baronies of southern Wexford.

==Architecture==
Notable churches within the town include the &quot;twin churches&quot;, Bride Street and Rowe Street with their distinctive spires; St Iberius&#x27; Church (Church of Ireland), which dates from the 18th Century; Saint Peter&#x27;s College, with a chapel designed by Augustus Welby Pugin; and Ann Street Presbyterian church. A former Quaker meeting hall is now a band room in High Street. The twin churches can be seen from any part of the town and in 2008, their 150th anniversary was celebrated. The larger twin, on Rowe Street, contains a peal of ten change-ringing bells, cast by Gillett &amp; Johnston in 1930.

In the early 21st century, Wexford saw the redevelopment of its quay front, and residential development at Clonard village. Also, the relocated offices of the Department of Environment were constructed near Wexford General Hospital on Newtown Road and opened in 2010.

==Economy==
Wexford&#x27;s success as a seaport declined in the first half of the 20th century because of the constantly changing sands of Wexford Harbour. By 1968 it had become unprofitable to keep dredging a channel from the harbour mouth to the quays in order to accommodate the larger ships of the era, so the port closed. The port had been extremely important to the local economy, with coal being a major import and agricultural machinery and grain being exported. The woodworks which fronted the quays and which were synonymous with Wexford were removed in the 1990s as part of a plan to claim the quay as an amenity for the town as well as retaining it as a commercially viable waterfront.

In the early 20th century, a new port was built about to the south at Rosslare Harbour, now known as Rosslare Europort. This is a deepwater harbour, unaffected by tides and currents. All major shipping now uses this port and Wexford Port is used only by fishing boats and leisure vessels.
Johnstown Castle, approximately 6 km from Wexford town, is headquarters to Teagasc, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

Major private-sector employers in and around the town include Wexford Creamery, Celtic Linen, Wexford Viking Glass, Parker Hannifin IPDE, Waters Technology, Kent Stainless, Equifax and BNY Mellon. Coca-Cola operates a research plant employing up to 160. Eishtec, which was acquired by Infosys in 2019, operates a call center in Wexford. Pamela Scott, A-wear and other retailers operate in the town. Public sector employers include Wexford County Council and Wexford General Hospital.

==Places of interest==

Curracloe Beach, approximately 10 km north of Wexford town, was the location in 1997 for the opening scenes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. A nature reserve and walking trail, at Raven Point Wood, is near Curracloe Beach.

The Irish National Heritage Park at Ferrycarrig includes various exhibits spanning 9000 years of Irish history, allowing the visitor to wander around re-creations of historic Irish dwellings including crannogs, Viking houses and Norman forts. The grounds also feature the archaeological site of Newtown, considered the first Norman fortification in Ireland.

The Wexford Wildfowl Reserve is a Ramsar site based on mudflats, (known locally as slobland), just outside Wexford. It is a migratory stop-off point for thousands of ducks, geese, swans and waders. Up to 12,000 (50% of the world&#x27;s population) of Greenland white-fronted geese spend the winter on the Wexford slobs. There is a visitor centre with exhibitions and an audio-visual show.

==Transport==
Wexford O&#x27;Hanrahan railway station opened on 17 August 1872. On 10 April 1966, the station was named after Michael O&#x27;Hanrahan, one of the executed leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. The railway line from Dublin to Rosslare Harbour runs along the quayside on the northeastern edge of the town. In 2010 the Rosslare Strand-Waterford rail services were suspended, due to budget cuts at Irish Rail.

Wexford is also served by local and national bus networks, primarily Bus Éireann, Wexford Bus and Ardcavan Bus. There are direct bus routes to Dublin, Carlow and Waterford. There are also many local taxi and hackney providers. Wexford Bus also operates a shuttle bus service which has stops at the town&#x27;s main facilities.

Rosslare Europort is south of Wexford. Car ferries run between Fishguard and Pembroke in Wales and Cherbourg and Roscoff in France. The ferry companies operating on these routes are Stena Line and Irish Ferries. Foot passengers can use the SailRail tickets from Wexford O&#x27;Hanrahan station via Rosslare Europort and Fishguard Harbour to reach Swansea, Cardiff Central and onwards including London Paddington.

The closest airport to Wexford is Waterford Airport which is approximately one hour away (70 km), but is not served by commercial flights. Dublin Airport is the closest airport to Wexford which operates commercial flights, which is approximately two hours away.

==Sport==

===Association football===
Wexford Football Club was admitted to the League of Ireland in 2007, and was the first Wexford-based club to take part in the competition. The club was the brainchild of former property developer and politician Mick Wallace, who funded the construction of a complex for the new team&#x27;s home at Newcastle, Ferrycarrig. In 2015, the team won the League of Ireland First Division. The club launched Wexford Youths WFC, a Women&#x27;s National League team, in 2011. A new team, Yola FC, was proposed in 2020 but was refused a license by the FAI.

===Gaelic football===
Wexford is also home to several Gaelic Athletic Association clubs. Though the town was traditionally associated with Gaelic football, with six teams providing ample outlets for its youngsters, it was not until 1960 that hurling took its foothold, with much due to local man Oliver &quot;Hopper&quot; McGrath&#x27;s contribution to the county&#x27;s All-Ireland Hurling Final triumph over the then-champions Tipperary. Having scored an early second-half goal to effectively kill off the opposition, McGrath went on to be the first man from the town of Wexford to receive an All-Ireland Hurling winner&#x27;s medal.

Although the team has not achieved county senior football success since 1956, St. Johns Volunteers of Wexford Town hold a record eleven county senior titles, as well as six minor titles. Other notable Gaelic football clubs in the town are Sarsfields, St. Mary&#x27;s of Maudlintown, Clonard and St. Joseph&#x27;s.

=== Hurling ===
One of the town&#x27;s local hurling clubs, Faythe Harriers, holds a record fifteen county minor championships, having dominated the minor hurling scene in the 1950s, late 1960s and early 1970s. The senior side has also won five Wexford Senior Hurling Championships.

===Other sports===
The clubhouse and course of Wexford Golf Club were finished in 2006 and 2007 respectively.

As of 2024, Wexford Wanderers RFC was playing in Division 2A of the Leinster League.

Ireland&#x27;s former boxing head coach and Olympian Billy Walsh is a native of Wexford and is associated with St. Ibars/Joseph&#x27;s boxing club in the town.

==Education==

There are five secondary schools serving the population of the town. These are Wexford CBS, Loreto Secondary School (girls&#x27; school); St Peter&#x27;s College (boys&#x27; school); Presentation Secondary School (girls&#x27; school); and The Vocational College/Selskar College (mixed school).

==Administration==

The historic borough of Wexford was abolished under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. However, by petition, it was re-established in 1846. Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the area became an urban district, while retaining the style of a borough corporation. Wexford Borough Corporation became a borough council in 2002. The boundary of the town was extended in 2008.

On 1 June 2014, the borough council was dissolved and the administration of the town was amalgamated with Wexford County Council. The local electoral area of Wexford forms the borough district of Wexford, as the town retains the right to be described as a borough. The chair of the borough district uses the title of mayor, rather than Cathaoirleach.

The parliamentary borough of Wexford returned two MPs to the Irish House of Commons until 1801. Under the Act of Union, the parliamentary borough returned one MP to the United Kingdom House of Commons, until its abolition under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. It was thereafter represented by the South Wexford from 1885 to 1922, and by the Dáil constituency of Wexford from 1921 to the present.

<doc id="215387" wikidata="Q153704" url="?curid=215387" title="History of Freemasonry">
<text>The history of Freemasonry encompasses the origins, evolution and defining events of the fraternal organisation known as Freemasonry. It covers three phases. Firstly, the emergence of organised lodges of operative masons during the Middle Ages, then the admission of lay members as &quot;accepted&quot; (a term reflecting the ceremonial &quot;acception&quot; process that made non-stone masons members of an operative lodge) or &quot;speculative&quot; masons, and finally the evolution of purely speculative lodges, and the emergence of Grand Lodges to govern them. The watershed in this process is generally taken to be the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London on the Gregorian 24 June 1717. The two difficulties facing historians are the paucity of written material, even down to the 19th century, and the misinformation generated by masons and non-masons alike from the earliest years.

Freemasonry&#x27;s long history includes its early development from organised bodies of operative stonemasons to the modern system of speculative lodges organised around regional or national &quot;Grand Lodges&quot;.

==Origin myths and theories==
===Early Masonic sources===
The earliest masonic texts each contain some sort of a history of the craft of masonry. The oldest known work of this type, The Halliwell Manuscript, also known as Regius Poem, dates from between 1390 and 1425. This document has a brief history in its introduction, stating that the &quot;craft of masonry&quot; began with Euclid in Egypt, and came to England in the reign of King Athelstan (924–939). Shortly afterwards, the Matthew Cooke Manuscript traces masonry to Jabal, son of Lamech (Genesis 4: 20–22), and tells how this knowledge came to Euclid, from him to the Children of Israel (while they were in Egypt), and so on through an elaborate path to Athelstan. This myth formed the basis for subsequent manuscript constitutions, all tracing masonry back to biblical times, and fixing its institutional establishment in England during the reign of Athelstan.

Shortly after the formation of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, James Anderson was commissioned to digest these &quot;Gothic Constitutions&quot; in a palatable, modern form. The resulting constitutions are prefaced by a history more extensive than any before, again tracing the history of what was now freemasonry back to biblical roots, again forging Euclid into the chain. True to his material, Anderson fixes the first grand assembly of English Masons at York, under Athelstan&#x27;s son, Edwin, who is otherwise unknown to history. Expanded, revised, and republished, Anderson&#x27;s 1738 constitutions listed the Grand Masters since Augustine of Canterbury, listed as &quot;Austin the Monk&quot;. William Preston&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of Freemasonry&quot; enlarged and expanded on this masonic creation myth.

In France, the 1737 lecture of Chevalier Ramsay added the crusaders to the lineage. He maintained that &quot;Crusader Masons&quot; had revived the craft with secrets recovered in the Holy Land, under the patronage of the Knights Hospitaller. At this point, the history of the craft in Continental Freemasonry diverged from that in England.

===Speculative histories===
Anderson&#x27;s histories of 1723 and 1738, Ramsay&#x27;s romanticisation, together with the internal allegory of masonic ritual, centred on King Solomon’s Temple and its architect, Hiram Abiff, have provided ample material for further speculation.

The earliest known ritual places the first masonic lodge in the porchway of King Solomon’s Temple. Following Anderson, it has also been possible to trace Freemasonry to Euclid, Pythagoras, Moses, the Essenes, and the Culdees. Preston started his history with the Druids, while Anderson&#x27;s description of masons as &quot;Noachides&quot;, extrapolated by Albert Mackey, put Noah into the equation.

Following Ramsay&#x27;s introduction of Crusader masons, the Knights Templar became involved in the myth, starting with Karl Gotthelf von Hund&#x27;s Rite of Strict Observance, which also linked in the exiled House of Stuart. The murder of Hiram Abiff was taken as an allegory for the death of Charles I of England. Oliver Cromwell emerges as the founder of Freemasonry in an anonymous anti-masonic work of 1745, commonly attributed to Abbé Larudan. Mackey states that &quot;The propositions of Larudan are distinguished for their absolute independence of all historical authority and for the bold assumptions which are presented to the reader in the place of facts.&quot; The anti-masonic writings of Christoph Friedrich Nicolai implicated Francis Bacon and the Rosicrucians, while Christopher Wren&#x27;s connection with the craft was omitted from Anderson&#x27;s first book of constitutions, but appeared in the second when Wren was dead.

The seed or the myth of Stuart Jacobite influence on Freemasonry may have been a careless and unsubstantiated remark made by John Noorthouk in the 1784 Book of Constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of London. It was stated, without support, that King Charles II (older brother and predecessor to James II) was made a Freemason in the Netherlands during the years of his exile (1649–60). However, there were no documented lodges of Freemasons on the continent during those years. The statement may have been made to flatter the fraternity by claiming a previous monarch asa member. This folly was then embellished by John Robison (1739–1805), a professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, in his 1797 work &quot;Proofs of a Conspiracy,&quot; an anti-Masonic polemic accusing Freemasonry of being infiltrated by Weishaupt&#x27;s Order of the Illuminati. The lack of scholarship exhibited by Robison in that work caused the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; to denounce it.

A German bookseller and Freemason, living in Paris, working under the assumed name of C. Lenning, embellished the story further in a manuscript titled &quot;Encyclopedia of Freemasonry&quot; probably written between 1822 and 1828 at Leipzig. This manuscript was later revised and published by another German Freemason named Friedrich Mossdorf (1757–1830). Lenning stated that King James II of England, after his flight to France in 1688, resided at the Jesuit College of Clermont, where his followers fabricated certain degrees for the purpose of carrying out their political ends.

By the mid-19th century, the story had gained currency. The well-known English Masonic writer, Dr. George Oliver (1782–1867), in his &quot;Historical Landmarks&quot;, 1846, carried the story forward and even claimed that King Charles II was active in his attendance at meetings—an obvious invention, for if it had been true, it would not have escaped the notice of the historians of the time.

Similarly, attempts to root Freemasonry in the French Compagnonnage have produced no concrete links. Connections to the Roman Collegia and Comacine masters are similarly tenuous, although some Freemasons see them as exemplars rather than ancestors. Thomas Paine traced Freemasonry to Ancient Egypt, as did Cagliostro, who went so far as to supply the ritual.

More recently, several authors have attempted to link the Templars to the timeline of Freemasonry through the imagery of the carvings in Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, where the Templars are rumoured to have sought refuge after the dissolution of the order. In &quot;The Hiram Key&quot;, Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight describe a timeline starting in ancient Egypt, and taking in Jesus, the Templars, and Rosslyn before arriving at modern Freemasonry. These claims are challenged by Robert Cooper, the curator of the Grand Lodge of Scotland&#x27;s library and museum, in his book The Rosslyn Hoax.

===Emergence of modern masonic studies===
The first rational study of masonic history was published in Germany, but Georg Kloss&#x27;s 1847 work, &quot;Geschichte der Freimaurerei in England, Irland und Schottland&quot; was never translated. When Findel&#x27;s &quot;History of Freemasonry&quot; was translated from German to English in 1866, Woodford in England and Murray-Lyon in Scotland were already active writers on the subject. Woodford was Findel&#x27;s guide when he visited York to inspect manuscripts, and would shortly collaborate with in collecting, dating and classifying the old manuscript constitutions. Albert Mackey was no less active in America. The list of his published works start in 1844 with &quot;A Lexicon of Freemasonry&quot;, and extend to his monumental &quot;Encyclopedia of Freemasonry&quot; in 1874. Increasing interest, and participation, in masonic studies led, in 1886, to the formation in London of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, the first lodge dedicated to masonic research.

==From origin to Grand Lodge Freemasonry==
===Origin of the term &quot;Freemason&quot;===
The earliest official English documents to refer to masons are written in Latin — &quot; (London 1212), &quot; (Oxford 1391) — or Norman French — &quot;&quot; (Statute of Labourers 1351). These all signify a worker in freestone, a grainless sandstone or limestone suitable for ornamental masonry. In the 17th century, building accounts of Wadham College the terms freemason and freestone mason are used interchangeably. Freemason also contrasts with &quot;Rough Mason&quot; or &quot;Layer&quot;, as a more skilled worker who worked or laid dressed stone.

The adjective &quot;free&quot; in this context may also be taken to infer that the mason is not enslaved, indentured or feudally bound. While this is difficult to reconcile with medieval English masons, it apparently became important to Scottish operative lodges.

===Master Masons in medieval England===
A medieval Master Mason would be required to undergo what passed for a liberal education in those days. In England, he would leave home at nine or ten years of age already literate in English and French, educated at home or at the petty (junior) school. From then until the age of fourteen, he would attend monastery or grammar school to learn Latin, or as a page in a knightly household would learn deportment in addition to his studies. Between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, he would learn the basic skills of choosing, shaping, and combining stone and then between the ages of 17 and 21, be required to learn by rote a large number of formal problems in geometry. Three years as a journeyman would often finish with the submission of a masterwork dealing with a set problem in construction or design. At this point, he was considered qualified, but still had a career ladder to climb before attaining the status of Master Mason on a large project.

In his function as architect, the Master Mason probably made his plans for each successive stage of a build in silverpoint on a prepared parchment or board. These would be realised on the ground by using a larger compass than the one used for drafting. Medieval architects are depicted with much larger compasses and squares where they are shown on a building site. Fine detail was transferred from the drawing board by means of wooden templates supplied to the masons.

The Master Masons who appear in record as presiding over major works, such as York Minster, became wealthy and respected. Visiting Master Masons and Master Carpenters sat at high table of monasteries, dining with the abbot.

===From the Middle Ages to the Reformation===
The historical record shows two levels of organisation in medieval masonry, the lodge and the &quot;guild&quot;. The original use of the word lodge indicates a workshop erected on the site of a major work, the first mention being Vale Royal Abbey in 1278. Later, it gained the secondary meaning of the community of masons in a particular place. The earliest surviving records of these are the laws and ordinances of the lodge at York Minster in 1352. These regulations were imposed by the Dean and Chapter of the Minster.

Nineteenth-century historians imposed the term &quot;guild&quot; on the &quot;fellowships&quot; of medieval tradesmen as an analogy with the merchant guilds. The masons were late in forming such bodies. The major employer of masons in medieval England was the crown, and the crown frequently employed masons by impressment. In other words, they were forcibly recruited when the need arose.

The Halliwell Manuscript, also called Regius Poem, is the oldest known document of masonic origin. It was published in 1840 by Shakespearean scholar and collector James Halliwell who dated it to 1390. A. F. A. Woodford, the pioneering Masonic scholar and a founder of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, agreed with this dating. More recently, historian Andrew Prescott has dated the text to the second quarter of the fifteenth century.

The poem may be seen as a response to a stream of legislation dating back to the Black Death, and the Statute of Labourers 1351, in which Edward III attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels. The earlier date follows the 1389 ordinance (13 Ric. 2. Stat. 1. c. 8) of Richard II requiring the guilds and fellowships to lay before him their charters and letters patent. In 1425, during the third Parliament of Henry VI, the (3 Hen. 6. c. 1) banned the annual assemblies of masons.

In 1356, the preamble to regulations governing the Trade of Masons specifically states that, unlike the other trades, no body existed for the regulation of masonry by masons. Finally, in 1376, four representatives of the &quot;mystery&quot; or trade are elected to the Common Council in London. This also seems to be the first use of the word &quot;freemason&quot; in English. It was immediately struck out, and replaced with the word &quot;mason&quot;.

The poem claims that these assemblies were ordained by King Athelstan and that he also linked the wages of a mason to the cost of living.

The Cooke Manuscript, dating from about 1450, set the pattern for what Anderson called the &quot;Gothic Constitutions&quot;, the older histories and regulations of the craft. After a brief blessing, these documents describe the seven Liberal Arts, assigning predominance to Geometry, which is equated with Masonry. They then proceed to a history of masonry/geometry, finishing with King Athelstan, or Edwin, his brother or son depending on source, assembling England&#x27;s masons to give them their charges. The regulations or charges follow, usually with instructions as to the manner in which a new mason should swear to them.

Also around 1450, the will of a mason from Beverley gives a tantalising glimpse into the emergence of masonic regalia. An inventory of John Cadeby&#x27;s possessions mentions several &quot;zonae&quot; (girdles). Two were silver mounted, and one of these had the letters B and I in the middle, indicating Boaz and Jachin, the twin pillars of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. He also owned a writing table and six English books, making him comfortably well-off and literate.

The following century and a half produced few new manuscripts. The Dowland manuscript, whose original is now lost, and Grand Lodge No 1, for the first time locate Edwin&#x27;s assembly of Masons at York. The Lansdowne, originally dated to this period, is now thought to date from the 17th century.

During this period, the Reformation occurred. It was at one time assumed that the church was the major employer of masons, and, with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the lodges disappeared. It was also believed that the craft &quot;guilds&quot; were abolished in England in 1547. On the death of Henry VIII, Archbishop Cranmer sought to advance the reformation by the abolition of guilds and fellowships. In 1548, &quot;The bill of conspiracies of victuallers and craftsmen&quot; was passed, revoking their monopolies. In 1549 it was repealed, presumably because they were too useful to the government. The government continued to be a major employer of masons, who in London had moved from a fellowship to a corporation. While this was not chartered until 1666, the state used it in the sixteenth century to procure and indent masons for building projects. In addition, masons were increasingly employed by private individuals. The Saints day parades by the various crafts, enacting plays about their various patron saints, were however suppressed. Robert Cooper, the archivist of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, believes that the lost mystery play of the masons may survive in the ritual of contemporary masonic lodges.

==Freemasonry in Scotland==

An early continental history quotes a 16th-century source that, by 1535, there were two Scottish masonic lodges recorded in France, one in Paris and the other in Lyon.

In Scotland, the lodges of masons were brought under the control of two crown-appointed officials, the Warden General and the Principal Master of Work to the Crown, the latter being in existence from 1539 at the latest. Towards the end of the century, William Schaw held both these posts. In 1598, in conference with the masters of lodges in south east Scotland, he produced a set of regulations for the governance of masons and their lodges now known as the Schaw Statutes. These state &quot;They shall be true to one another and live charitably together as becometh sworn brethren and companions of the Craft.&quot; They mention wardens, deacons, entered prentices and cowans. The second Schaw statutes, a year later, included in their negotiations a representative of the Lodge of Kilwinning (now Lodge Mother Kilwinning No 0) in Ayrshire, which was assigned jurisdiction over the west of Scotland. Edinburgh became the &quot;first and principal&quot; lodge and Kilwinning the &quot;second and head&quot; lodge of Scotland, attempting to appease all parties. Since neither the King nor the master of Kilwinning was present, the document was not regarded as final or binding. It was assumed that the King&#x27;s warrant for the regulations would be obtained. In 1602, Schaw wrote a Charter granting to Sir William St Clair of Rosslyn the right to purchase patronage over the masons of Scotland. Kilwinning is noticeably absent from the list of lodges appending their endorsement. The charter seems to have lapsed when St Clair fled following a scandal, and a second charter was granted to his son, also William St Clair, in 1628. This patronage was surrendered by their descendant, another William St Clair, on the formation of the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1736, in spite of the fact that it never won the royal approval that would have made it valid.

===Emergence of speculative masonry===

The lasting effect of the Schaw Statutes arose from the 1599 directive that the lodges should employ a reputable notary as secretary, and that he should record all important transactions. The Scottish lodges began to keep minutes, and therefore the appearance of &quot;accepted&quot; (non-operative) masons is better recorded than in England, where there are no known internal records of lodge proceedings.

The first recorded admission of non-masons was on 3 July 1634 at Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary&#x27;s Chapel) No. 1, in the persons of Sir Anthony Alexander, his elder brother, Lord Alexander, and Sir Alexander Strachan of Thornton. Sir Anthony was the King&#x27;s Principal Master of Work, and the man who had effectively blocked the second St Clair charter, the lodges of Scotland being his own responsibility. The reasons that his brother and their friend were also admitted are unclear.

The reasons and mechanisms for the transition of masonic lodges from operative communities to speculative fellowships remain elusive. As the responsibility for design shifted from the Master Mason to the architect in the sixteenth century, it is probable that architects started to join the lodges of the masons they worked with. It is also possible that, along with other professional bodies (including the East India Company), operative masonic lodges began to raise money by charging the gentry for admission to their &quot;mysteries&quot;. Another opinion states that masonic lodges deliberately recruited the rich and powerful in an attempt to improve their pay and working conditions.

==England versus Scotland membership==
On 20 May 1641, Sir Robert Moray was initiated into Freemasonry by several Freemasons who were members of the Lodge of Edinburgh. Although he was initiated into a Scottish lodge, the event took place south of the border: this is earliest extant record of a man being initiated into speculative Freemasonry on English soil.

While lodge records show a gradual development of mixed lodges in Scotland, it is evident that the lodge which initiated Elias Ashmole at Warrington on 16 October 1646 was mainly or entirely composed of speculative or accepted masons. In 1686, Robert Plot&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Staffordshire&quot; contains a passage about persons of quality being admitted to the society of free-masons, whose history Plot finds invented and ridiculous. At the start of the Grand Lodge period, there appears to have been a predominance of purely speculative lodges in the south of England, with operative and mixed lodges still in the majority in the north and in Scotland.

In 1716, four lodges and &quot;some old Brothers&quot; met at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden and agreed to meet again the next year to form a &quot;Grand Lodge.&quot; These were the Goose and Gridiron, the Crown, the Apple Tree, and the Rummer and Grapes. The &quot;old Brothers&quot; were probably from the Cheshire Cheese and at least one other lodge.

==Early Grand Lodge period==
===First Grand Lodge===
The early history of Grand Lodge is uncertain, since no minutes were taken until 1723. It is known that the four lodges mentioned above held an assembly at the Goose and Gridiron, in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, on, 24 June 1717 (the Feast of St John the Baptist). They agreed to restore their &quot;Quarterly Communications,&quot; four meetings a year for the transaction of masonic business, and an annual assembly to elect the next Grand Master. At this meeting, they elected Anthony Sayer, Master of the lodge at the Apple Tree, of whom little else is known, and the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster was born. At this stage, it is unlikely that they saw themselves as anything more than an association of London lodges. This perception was to change very rapidly.

The next year, George Payne became Grand Master. He was a career civil servant with the commissioners of taxes. In 1719, they elected John Theophilus Desaguliers, a clergyman, an eminent scientist, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. The last commoner to serve as Grand Master was George Payne in his second term of office in 1720/21, when he wrote &quot;The General Regulations of a Free Mason&quot; which were later incorporated in Anderson&#x27;s Constitutions. Thereafter, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to raise the profile of the organisation, all the Grand Masters have been members of the nobility.

Desaguliers is often described as the &quot;father&quot; of modern freemasonry. It was Desaguliers who inscribed the dedication to Anderson&#x27;s Constitutions, headed the committee which directed and approved them, and supplied the &quot;Gothic Constitutions&quot; from which they were formed. Although he only served one term as Grand Master, he was twice Deputy Grand Master under figurehead Grand Masters, and at other times behaved as if he was Grand Master, forming irregular lodges to conduct initiations. It seems to have been Desaguliers who insisted that ritual be remembered rather than written down, leading to a dearth of material on the development of English ritual until after the formation of United Grand Lodge.

These considerations cause many masonic historians to see him as the guiding intelligence as the new Grand Lodge embarked on an era of self-publicity, which saw the sudden expansion of speculative masonry, with a corresponding rise in anti-masonic groups and publications. Initiations began to be reported in newspapers. The noble grand masters were often fellows of the Royal Society, but the Duke of Wharton (1722–23) had just had his Hell-fire club shut down by the government, and joined, or possibly formed, an anti-masonic group called the Gormagons almost as soon as he left office. From 1721 the installation of the new Grand Master was the occasion for a parade, originally on foot, later in carriages. This became the subject of some ridicule, until starting in 1740 there were also mock processions by anti-masonic groups, leading to the discontinuation of the practice in 1747. The rapid expansion of freemasonry also led to many new lodges failing after only a year or two. In addition to attacks from outside the craft, there were now disillusioned ex-masons willing to make money out of &quot;exposures&quot; of freemasonry.

===Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Constitutions&quot;===
&quot;The Constitutions of the Free-Masons&quot;, &quot;For the Use of the Lodges&quot; in London and Westminster, was published in 1723. It was edited by the presbyterian clergyman, James Anderson, to the order of John Theophilus Desaguliers, and approved by a Grand Lodge committee under his control. This work was reprinted in Philadelphia in 1734 by Benjamin Franklin, who was that year elected Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. It was also translated into Dutch (1736), German (1741), and French (1745).

Anderson was minister of the Presbyterian church in Swallow Street, London, which had once been Huguenot church, and one of its four Deacons was Desaguliers&#x27; father. At the time of his meeting with Desaguliers, he seems to have passed himself off as a Talmudic scholar. His reward for his labours was the copyright on the work. In time, and to Anderson&#x27;s dismay, it was condensed into &quot;pocket&quot; editions over which he had no control and from which he received no income. It was expanded, updated, and re-published in 1738.

The historical section, which comprises almost half the book, has already been described. This is followed by the &quot;Charges&quot;, general rules for the conduct of Freemasons, and Payne&#x27;s Regulations, the specific rules by which Grand Lodge and the lodges under its control were to be governed. The ceremony for dedicating a new lodge was briefly outlined, and the work finished with a section of songs. For the first time, the old hand-written charges and constitutions was replaced by an accessible, printed condensation of all there was to being a Freemason, omitting only the ritual. Although the historical section was attacked at the time, and ever since, as being a work of obvious fiction, the work remains a milestone in masonic history. The &quot;Antient Charges&quot; published in the current &quot;Book of Constitutions&quot; of the United Grand Lodge of England have altered little from those originally published by Anderson.

===Degrees and rituals of Freemasonry===
In common with other trades or mysteries, medieval masonry recognised three grades of craftsman;— the apprentice, the journeyman, and the master. An apprentice who had learned his craft became a journeyman, qualified to do all manner of masonic work. The master was also qualified as a project manager, often functioning as architect as well. He would sketch the day&#x27;s work on a tracing board for execution by the journeymen and apprentices. The Schaw Statutes of 1598 show how this had evolved in the lodge system of Scottish masonry. An apprentice, after serving his term of seven years, could elect to pay to join a lodge, becoming an &quot;entered apprentice&quot;. (Alternatively, he could elect to freelance on the lower grades of building work as a &quot;Cowan&quot;.) The journeymen were referred to as &quot;fellows&quot; or &quot;fellows of the craft&quot;, which accords with the Regius poem&#x27;s injunction (line 51) that masons should &quot;calle other felows by cuthe&quot;. The members of the lodge were &quot;Brithers&quot; (brothers), a Scottish legal term for those bound to each other by oath. The Master was simply the mason in charge of the lodge, or one who had held that distinction.

While the swearing of some sort of oath goes back to the earliest records of organised masonry, the first recorded ritual is not until 1696, in the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. From this, and from other documents of the same period, such as the Trinity College, Dublin manuscript of 1711, we can form an idea of the ritual of an operative lodge at the end of the 17th century. On taking of the oath of an Entered Apprentice a mason was entrusted with appropriate signs, a &quot;Mason&#x27;s Word&quot;, and a catechism. This was accompanied by much horseplay, which was probably excised as the craft became more gentrified. The fellowcraft was made to take a further oath, and entrusted with two further words and the &quot;five points of fellowship&quot;, which in 1696 were foot to foot, knee to knee, heart to heart, hand to hand, and ear to ear. The distinction between a fellowcraft and a master is unclear, and in many documents they appear to be synonymous. As accepted masons became initiated, where the various words and signs could no longer be regarded as professional qualifications, the entered apprentice ritual and the fellowcraft/master were sometimes condensed into one ceremony.

In Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Masonry Dissected&quot;, an exposure of masonic ritual written in 1730 by a disillusioned ex-mason, we see for the first time something recognisable as the three degrees of modern Freemasonry. On being admitted to a lodge, a new mason naturally progresses through the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. There still remains the rank of Installed Master, which comprises the Master in charge of the lodge and its past masters, and involves its own ritual, words and signs, but entails being elected to take charge of the lodge for a year. These are the regular degrees and ranks of &quot;craft&quot; masonry, common to all constitutions. Other, &quot;higher&quot; degrees are optional and require a mason to join a side-order, except in lodges constituted under the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which are empowered to confer the Mark Master Mason degree on Master Masons, as an extension to the second or Fellowcraft degree. (see main article, Freemasonry)

Anderson&#x27;s 1723 constitutions seem to recognise only the grades of Entered Apprentice, and the Fellowcraft/Master. Hence the third degree emerged sometime between 1723 and 1730, and took some time to spread within the craft. The fact that it did spread seems to many scholars to indicate that the tri-gradal system was not so much innovation, as the re-organisation of pre-existing material. The Mason word, once given to the Entered Apprentice, was now conferred in the third degree with the five points of fellowship, and the two linked words formerly bestowed on a fellowcraft were split between the first two degrees. The new Master Mason degree was centred on the myth of Hiram Abiff, which itself consists of three parts. The first is the biblical story of the Tyrian artisan with a Northern Israelite mother who became a master craftsman involved in the construction of King Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The second is the story of his murder by subordinates, which is similar to one of the legends of the French Compagnonnage. Lastly, the story of the finding of his body, and the derivation therefrom of the five points of fellowship, which appears in the Graham Manuscript of 1725, where the body being sought and exhumed is that of Noah. The origin of this re-organisation is unknown. The earliest reference to the conferment of a third degree is from London, from the minutes of &quot;Philo Musicae et Architecturae Societas Apollini&quot;, a short-lived musical society composed entirely of Freemasons. These minutes record the initiation and passing to the degree of Fellowcraft of Charles Cotton. Then, on 12 May 1725, the society took it upon itself to &quot;pass&quot; Brother Cotton and Brother Papillion Ball as Master Masons. This would nowadays be regarded as highly irregular. In March 1726 Gabriel Porterfield received the same degree in lodge Dumbarton Kilwinning in Scotland. That he was not the first is attested by the minutes of the lodge&#x27;s foundation, only two months earlier, where Apprentices, Fellowcrafts, and Master Masons are recorded as attending. In December 1728, Greenock Kilwinning recorded separate fees for initiation, passing and raising.

===Spread of Grand Lodges (1725–1750)===
Even in London, there were many lodges that never affiliated with the new Grand Lodge. These unaffiliated Masons and their Lodges were referred to as &quot;Old Masons,&quot; or &quot;St John Masons&quot;, and &quot;St John Lodges&quot;. Nonetheless, the influence of the new central body spread quickly, and the 1725 minutes mention lodges in ten provincial towns as far north as Salford, with Provincial Grand Lodges in South Wales and Cheshire.

In the same year, a second Grand Lodge was founded in Ireland, which took several decades to bring all the Irish lodges under its wing. Rival Grand Lodges quickly appeared in Cork (The Grand Lodge of Munster). It was in Ireland that the practice of recognising the regularity of a lodge by the issue of a warrant began, the first known example dating from 1731. The Grand Lodge of Scotland was not formed until 1736.

Also in 1725 &quot;The Ancient and Honourable Society and Fraternity of Freemasons meeting since time immemorial in the City of York&quot; assumed the title, &quot; The Grand Lodge of All England meeting in the City of York.&quot; This should not be interpreted as rivalry, as there was no overlap in the two jurisdictions. Indeed, Anderson&#x27;s history would have produced the expectation of an older Grand Lodge at York, and the London Lodges were duly furnished with minutes going back some twenty years. Anderson&#x27;s 1738 &quot;Constitutions&quot; recognised the independence of &quot;the Old Lodge of York City. and the Lodges of Scotland, Ireland. France, Italy, etc&quot;.

However, in 1735, the Master and Wardens of an Irish lodge were refused admission to Grand Lodge because they did not have the written authority of the Grand Master of Ireland. It seems that they hoped to be recognised as a deputation from Lord Kingston, then Grand Master of Ireland, and Past Grand Master of the London Grand Lodge. They were offered, and refused, the English authorisation. This has been interpreted as evidence of a split between the two constitutions.

Responding to the popularity of Pritchard&#x27;s and other exposures of masonic ritual, Grand Lodge, about this time, made changes to ritual and passwords to make it more difficult for outsiders to pass themselves off as masons. These changes were not universally accepted by affiliated lodges. The Goose and Gridiron (now Lodge of Antiquity No. 2), one of the original and most senior lodges of the constitution, never adopted them. For the unaffiliated, the innovations simply deepened the division. At the time, London was absorbing many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already Freemasons felt that they could not work with the new ritual, and the lodges they formed swelled further the numbers of unaffiliated lodges in the capital.

In the same period, Freemasonry as practiced by the English, Irish and Scottish lodges began to spread to Europe. The establishment of the first Grand Lodge in France is particularly problematic. Freemasonry itself appears to have been established in France by exiled Jacobites. The Grand Lodge of France dates its foundation to 1728, when it claims the Grand Master was the Duke of Wharton. Some Grand Orient seals date the first Grand Lodge to 1736 (the split between the Grand Lodge and the Grand Orient occurred in 1773). French histories date the first Grand Lodge to 24 June 1738. The situation seems confused, as other histories state that the first legitimate Grand Lodge was formed on 11 December 1743 as &quot;The English Grand Lodge of France&quot; with the Count of Clermont as grand master. Although the government of the craft was in the hands of a series of deputies, the protection of the count until his death in 1771 afforded French masonry a period of stability and growth. As masonry was persecuted in other catholic states, the moral and egalitarian nature of the French lodges accorded with the spirit of the age.

Although Anderson seems to imply the existence of an Italian Grand Lodge, no such body existed until the creation of the Grand Orient of Italy in 1805. The first lodge was the English Lodge (&quot;La Loggia degli Inglesi&quot;) in Florence, founded in 1731, and Freemasonry quickly spread, in spite of a series of Papal bans.

The first appearance of the many German Grand Lodges dates from the 1740s, notably &quot;Of the Three Globes&quot;, founded in Berlin in 1744, which became the &quot;Grand National Mother Lodge&quot; in 1772. Frederick the Great became a Freemason while he was still Crown Prince and personally sanctioned the Berlin Lodge. Although a few authors cite the existence of German operative grand lodges as far back as that formed at Cologne Cathedral in 1250, continuity of tradition has been hard to prove, and most sources believe the Eighteenth-century German speculative lodges show descent from the English model.

Freemasonry was brought to the Russian Empire by foreign officers in the Russian service. For instance, James Keith is recorded as being master of a lodge in Saint Petersburg in 1732–34. Several years later his cousin John Keith, 3rd Earl of Kintore was appointed Provincial Grand Master of Russia by the Grand Lodge of England. In the early 1770s, Ivan Yelagin succeeded in reorganizing Russian Freemasonry into a far-reaching system that united some 14 lodges and about 400 government officials. He secured English authorization of the first Russian Grand Lodge and became its Provincial Grand Master. Most Russian lodges were attracted to the Swedish Rite. In 1782, Ivan Schwarz represented Russia at the masonic congress in Wilhelmsbad (a health resort in Hanau), where Russia was recognized as the 8th province of the Rite of Strict Observance. See History of Freemasonry in Russia for further details.

=== Rival Grand Lodges ===
On 17 July 1751, representatives of six Lodges gathered at the Turk&#x27;s Head Tavern, in Greek Street, Soho, London. Five were unaffiliated lodges of mainly Irish membership, and the sixth appears to have been formed shortly beforehand for the business of the evening. On that night, they established the &quot;Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions&quot;, now commonly known as the Grand Lodge of the Antients. The first Grand Secretary, John Morgan, obtained a position in the Navy, and resigned after seven months. His successor, Laurence Dermott, presided as Grand Secretary for almost twenty years, being deputy Grand Master on three occasions after that, and exercised considerable influence until his death in 1791.

Dermott&#x27;s immediate impact was in replacing the regulations that Morgan had written with those of his own lodge in Dublin. In 1756 he published the Antient&#x27;s own book of constitutions, entitled the &quot;Ahiman Rezon&quot;, for which no meaning is known. Modeled on Spratt&#x27;s Irish Constitutions, the regulations are comprehensive and well written, and are followed by an extended section devoted to songs. At the beginning, instead of Anderson&#x27;s history, is an extended introduction attacking the original Grand Lodge, now calling itself the Grand Lodge of England, but saddled by Dermott with &quot;the Moderns&quot; in contrast to the &quot;Ancient&quot; usages of the new Grand Lodge. This name remains in use to the present day. His main weapon was satire. He started with an account of how he attempted to write a history which would better the others by describing masonry before Adam, but towards the end of the first volume, he fell asleep. He dreamed of a conversation with Ahimon, one of four sojourners from Jerusalem, about the futility of masonic histories, after which an ancient in a shining breastplate perused his first volume and pronounced, &quot;Thou hast div&#x27;d deep into the water, and hast brought up a potsherd&quot;. He was woken by his neighbour&#x27;s puppy eating his manuscript. Dermott then proceeded to a reasoned explanation of why a new Mason should not join a &quot;Moderns&quot; lodge, since their amended passwords would not be recognised by any of the other Grand Lodges which at that time existed. There follows a humorous account of their &quot;unconstitutional fopperies&quot;, including Dermott&#x27;s belief that their greatest masonic symbols were the knife and fork.

Under Dermott&#x27;s influence, penmanship, and oratory, the new Grand Lodge grew to be a serious challenge to the original. The Antient&#x27;s lodges were warranted from 1752, a practice not taken up by the Moderns for another two decades. As the unaffiliated lodges increasingly saw the sense of belonging to a larger organisation, they usually found that the Antients practice was closer to their own, although it was known for lodges to change allegiance from the Antients to the Moderns. The fact that the practices eventually adopted by the United Grand Lodge largely reflect those of the Antients is attributable to Dermott&#x27;s industry.

While the emergence of the Antients simply consolidated a division in English Freemasonry, a schism occurred within the Moderns in 1777/78. While this only involved one lodge, it was the oldest and most prestigious in the constitution, and its Master the Moderns&#x27; most respected author and historian. William Preston was already in dispute with the Grand Secretary over the royalties to the new Book of Constitutions he had just written. Some members of his Lodge of Antiquity (formerly the Goose and Gridiron, or the Old Lodge of St Paul&#x27;s), having attended church as masons, walked back to the lodge in their regalia. Three brethren saw fit to report this to the Moderns Grand Lodge as an unauthorised masonic parade. Preston, the Master of Antiquity, sided with the accused, arguing that since the lodge was one of the original four, it had only subscribed to the original constitutions, and did not require any other authority to hold a parade. For this, he was promptly expelled. Antiquity responded by expelling the three who had complained. At least half of the lodge seceded to the Grand Lodge of All England at York, quoting Article 39 of Payne&#x27;s regulations, that the Landmarks of the order must be preserved in any new regulations of Grand Lodge (alluding to their own rights and privileges). Antiquity became, for the period of separation, &quot;the Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent&quot;, warranting at least two lodges in its own right. The dispute was not resolved until May 1789, when Preston and his brethren were received back into the Moderns with much feasting and fanfare.

A similar situation arose in Scotland. Seniority was assigned according to the dating of lodge minutes, and due to a fire, Kilwinning records started at 1642, somewhat later than the Lodge of St Mary&#x27;s Chapel in Edinburgh. Offended by being recognised as only the second lodge in the constitution, Lodge Mother Kilwinning withdrew from the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1743, and did not rejoin until 1807. During this period, Kilwinning functioned as yet another Grand Lodge, chartering about 70 lodges in Scotland and abroad. While the two Grand Lodges ignored each other at an official level, there does not appear to have been any real animosity, with no bar on masons visiting lodges in the competing jurisdiction. One Kilwinning member became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The Lodge at Melrose, claiming an antiquity at least as great as Kilwinning, simply ignored the Grand Lodge of Scotland, again chartering daughter lodges, with the Master being addressed as &quot;Grand Master&quot;. They finally joined the national body on 25 February 1891 as The Lodge of Melrose St John No 1 bis.

In the wake of the French Revolution, the British Government became uneasy about possible revolutionary conspiracies. Amongst other repressive measures, Pitt&#x27;s government proposed to introduce the Unlawful Societies Act in 1799, which declared that any body which administered a secret oath was illegal. Acting quickly, a delegation representing the Ancients, Moderns and the Grand Lodge of Scotland arranged a meeting with the Prime Minister. The delegation included the Duke of Atholl, Grand Master of the Ancients, and Past Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Earl of Moira, Acting Grand Master of the Moderns (the Grand Master being the Prince of Wales). As a result of this meeting, Freemasons were specifically excluded from the act, although lodges were obliged to return a list of members to the local Clerk of the Peace, a practice which continued until 1967. It also demonstrated that the two rival Grand Lodges could act together.

===Establishment of Freemasonry in North America===
In 1682, Scot John Skene came to New Jersey, and was dedicated by the Grand Lodge of New Jersey as the first Freemason resident in America. 
In 1733, Henry Price, the Provincial Grand Master over all of North America for the Grand Lodge of England, granted a charter to a group of Boston Freemasons. This lodge was later named St. John&#x27;s Lodge and was the first duly constituted lodge in America. Between 1733 and 1737 the Grand Lodge in England warranted Provincial Grand Lodges in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Benjamin Franklin re-issued Anderson&#x27;s 1723 constitutions as Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania. Franklin had written in the Pennsylvania Gazette of 8 December 1730 of the several lodges of freemasons already in the &quot;province&quot;, joined St. John&#x27;s Lodge in Philadelphia the following year, and in 1732 was Junior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Philadelphia. All this before the &quot;first&quot; lodge in North America.

Correspondence from John Moore, the collector for the port of Philadelphia and himself a Mason, indicate that Masonic Lodges were meeting in Philadelphia in 1715. The present Grand Lodge has the Carmick manuscript, a handwritten copy of the ancient charges dating from 1727, and headed &quot;The Constitutions of St. John&#x27;s Lodge&quot;. Colonel Daniel Coxe was made Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the Grand Lodge of England in 1730, with effect from 24 June (St. John the Baptist&#x27;s day) for two years. It is unclear whether he was in America or England at the time, but he was present at Grand Lodge, at the Devil Tavern in London, on 29 January 1731, where he is minuted as &quot;Provincial Grand Master of North America&quot;. There is no record of his chartering any lodges, but he arranged for St. John&#x27;s Lodge to double as a Provincial Grand Lodge, and appointed his successor in 1731, a year early. Notwithstanding the acceptance of Coxe as their first Provincial Grand Master, it has been suggested that the formation of the new Grand Lodge by consenting pre-existing lodges makes it a Grand Lodge by &quot;Immemorial right&quot;, and a sister lodge to the Grand Lodges of England Scotland and Ireland.

North America would have many independent lodges in the 18th century. Authorisation, which later would become a Warrant, took time and expense, especially in the period when the nearest Grand Lodge was on the other side of the Atlantic. Many lodges became &quot;self starters&quot;, and only applied for Grand Lodge authorisation when they were reasonably confident that the lodge would survive for more than a few years. George Washington was initiated into the Lodge of Fredericksburg in 1752. The same lodge was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1758. The first properly chartered &quot;Scottish&quot; lodge was only two years earlier, being the Lodge of St. Andrews in Boston. Members included Paul Revere and Joseph Warren, and (according to some) later lodge outings included the Boston Tea Party.

Many lodges were attached British Army regiments. The Moderns may have been wary of warranting lodges without a permanent address, so there was only one Grand Lodge of England warrant in the continental army from 1775 to 1777. The Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were slightly better represented, but the overwhelming majority of regimental lodges held warrants from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Thus it was that a group of African Americans, having been rejected by the lodges in Boston, were initiated into Lodge No 441 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was attached to the 38th Foot (later the 1st Staffordshire). These 15 men formed African Lodge No 1, as the British departed, leaving them a permit to do almost everything but admit new masons. Two of the members were seafarers, and obtained entrance to a lodge in London, being recognised as regularly initiated Masons. This enabled their master, Prince Hall, to apply to the Moderns for a charter, which was duly granted on 29 September 1784, now as African Lodge No. 459. Such was the success of the lodge that it became a Provincial Grand Lodge, and Prince Hall the Provincial Grand Master. After his death, the provincial lodges reconstituted themselves as a grand lodge (African Grand Lodge), becoming Prince Hall Grand Lodge in 1847. Around the same time, the history of Freemasonry in Mexico can be traced to at least 1806 when the first Masonic lodge was formally established in the nation.

==Royal Arch Freemasonry==
The majority of this article deals with craft, or &quot;blue lodge&quot; masonry, the three degrees that are common to all masonic lodges and jurisdictions. Further degrees are usually outside of the jurisdiction of Grand Lodges, involve separate ceremonies, and are regulated by different Masonic bodies. The number and names of the &quot;chivalric&quot; orders and degrees depend on the local tradition of Freemasonry, and have varied greatly over the years. The oldest of these, and the most universal, is the Royal Arch Chapter (the Holy Royal Arch in England).

Although some masonic writers have attempted to see Royal Arch symbolism in material from the 1720s, the earliest definite reference is to a Royal Arch in a procession in Dublin preceding the master and held aloft by two &quot;Excellent Masons&quot;. In 1744 it is mentioned as a degree in Dr Dassigny&#x27;s &quot;Serious and Impartial Inquiry&quot;.

Laurence Dermott, the guiding force behind the Ancients Grand Lodge, claimed to have been made a Royal Arch Mason in Dublin in 1746. He referred to it as the fourth degree, and campaigned to have it recognised as such. This happened just after he died, and only twenty years before the union of the Ancients and Moderns. The Moderns, on the other hand, had created a separate Grand Chapter in 1765 to deal with the degree, and wished to keep it separate from pure craft masonry. This would be a point of contention as the two jurisdictions moved towards union. The second of the articles of union stated that there were but three degrees in &quot;pure Ancient Masonry&quot;, but included the Royal Arch in the third degree. The degree continues to be administered by a separate Grand Chapter, and until a revision in 2004, English Master Masons were simply told that the degree of the Holy Royal Arch completes their third degree.

The oldest Irish records of the ritual indicate that Royal Arch Chapters originally administered three degrees. The first was based on the refurbishment of the first temple by King Josiah. The second was a short bridge to the third, which was based on the rebuilding of the temple after the exile. Most jurisdictions base the modern Royal Arch ritual on the post-exilic legend. In 1864, the Grand Chapter of Ireland decided to base their ritual on the reign of Josiah, the main practical difference being the names of the officers.

==19th century Freemasonry==
===Union of 1813===
In 1809, the Grand Lodge of England (the Moderns) set up a &quot;Lodge of Promulgation&quot;. Its purpose was to &quot;revert to the Ancient Land Marks of the Society&quot; and to promulgate those landmarks amongst the brethren. One of its members was the Duke of Sussex, the Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, No 2, and sixth son of George III. The result of their labours was a reply to the Ancients in 1811 that the Grand Lodge had resolved to &quot;return to the Ancient Landmarks...when it should be ascertained what those ancient landmarks and obligations were.&quot; Both Grand Lodges moved visibly towards union, forming committees to negotiate the precise terms. The main sticking point was the inability of the Ancients&#x27; committee to decide anything without reporting back to a quarterly meeting of their own Grand Lodge. In October 1812, the Ancients allayed the frustration of the Moderns by granting their commissioners full powers. Shortly after this, the Earl of Moira resigned as acting Grand Master of the Moderns, due to his appointment as Governor General of India. His successor was the Duke of Sussex, who became Grand Master the next January on the resignation of his brother, the Prince of Wales. On 1 December 1813, the Duke of Atholl ceded the leadership of the Ancients to the Duke of Kent, the older brother of Sussex and the father of Queen Victoria. Kent had already presided over the union of the Ancients and Moderns in Canada, accomplished by the brutally simple expedient of merging the lodges of the Moderns with the nearest lodge of the Ancients. The Moderns in Canada had simply ceased to exist. These two men oversaw the union in 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge of England, with the Duke of Sussex appointed as Grand Master of the new body.

The actual process of unification continued for some years, first with the Lodge of Reconciliation (1813–1816), made up of two lodges, one of each constitution, which ironed out some sort of ritual acceptable to the two parties. The work of this lodge was spread by the Stability Lodge of Instruction (1817) and fleshed out by the Emulation Lodge of Improvement (1823 onwards). The new Grand Lodge essentially ended up with the ritual of the Ancients and the infrastructure of the Moderns. While the &quot;Emulation Ritual&quot; became the standard, many variations still exist which, while mutually recognisable, present many flavours of Masonic ritual within the English Constitution.

===Morgan affair and decline in American Freemasonry (1826–c.1850)===
In 1826, William Morgan disappeared from Batavia, New York, after threatening to expose Freemasonry&#x27;s secrets, causing some to claim that he had been murdered by Masons. What exactly occurred has never been conclusively proven. However, Morgan&#x27;s disappearance – and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers – sparked a series of protests against Freemasons throughout the United States, especially in New York and neighboring states. The protracted backlash led to many masons quitting.

Under the leadership of Thurlow Weed, an anti-Masonic and anti-Andrew Jackson (Jackson was a Mason) movement grew to become the Anti-Masonic Party and made the ballot for the presidency in 1828 while gaining the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward. Its influence was such that other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, denounced the Masons. In 1847, Adams wrote a widely distributed book titled &quot;Letters on the Masonic Institution&quot; that was highly critical of the Masons. In 1832, the party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate. Wirt was secretly a Freemason, and even gave a speech at the Anti-Masonic convention defending the organization. The party only received seven electoral votes. Three years later, the party had disbanded in every state save Pennsylvania, as other issues such as slavery had become the focus of national attention.

===American Freemasons during the Civil War===
The fortunes of American Freemasonry declined sharply following the Morgan Affair, only to rebound as the force of the Anti-Masonic movement sputtered out in the mid-1830s. By the late 1850s, masonry in America was the subject of renewed popular interest and lodge membership, which had bottomed out during the anti-Masonic period began to rise. By the time of the American Civil War, U.S. freemasonry tripled its membership from 66,000 to 200,000 members in over 5000 lodges nationwide. This surge in membership helps explain, at least in part, the many stories of Masonic fraternisation during the American Civil War, which include accounts of Masonic soldiers and sailors rescuing enemy combatants who identified themselves as members of the fraternity. Masonic incidents are also recorded involving Freemasons burying their own with Masonic formalities during battle, as well as aid and special treatment given to Masonic POWs.

After the Civil War, American Freemasonry flourished along with other fraternal organizations during the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Fraternalism&quot; from approximately 1870 to 1920.

===France===
In France, the number of Freemasons grew from 10,000 in 1802, when Napoleon gave it semi-official status, to 20,000 in 1889, 32,000 in 1908, 40,000 in 1926, and about 60,000 in 1936. At an early stage, nearly all the lodges were affiliated with the Radical party. Zeldin argues that in 19th century France:

Rumors were rife, especially in conservative circles, that the order secretly ran the government, and was the main source of materialistic and anti-clerical propaganda. Zeldin concludes that was a &quot;vast exaggeration.&quot; The details are known because the Vichy regime in 1941 seized the archives, and failed to find significant evidence. While the order did support anti-clerical campaigns, it did not initiate them. Its primary role was to serve as a social club which the members could rise in the world, and get 10% discounts in shops owned by fellow Masons. The chapters provided some charity and life insurance. In 1904 a scandal erupted because the Grand Orient de France lodges were asked by the Radical government to secretly collect information about the religious and political affiliations of army officers, with a view to blocking the promotion of Catholics. When the news leaked out, the government was forced to resign. The concern with Radical politics gradually declined, and it disappeared after 1945.

According to Ernest Belfort Bax, Freemasons were responsible for the last serious attempt at conciliation between Versailles and the Paris Commune on 21 April 1871. They were received coldly by Adolphe Thiers, who assured them that, though Paris was given over to destruction and slaughter, the law should be enforced, and he kept his word. A few days after they decided, in a public meeting, to plant their banner on the ramparts and throw in their lot with the Commune. On the 29th, accordingly, 10,000 of the brethren met (55 lodges being represented), and marched to the Hôtel de Ville, headed by the Grand Masters in full insignia and the banners of the lodges. Amongst them the new banner of Vincennes was conspicuous, bearing the inscription in red letters on a white ground, &quot;Love one another.&quot; A balloon was then sent up, which let fall at intervals, outside Paris, a manifesto of the Freemasons. The procession then wended its way through the boulevards and the Champs Elysées to the Arc de Triomphe, where the banners were planted at various points along the ramparts. On seeing the white flag on the Porte Maillot the Versaillese ceased firing, and the commander, himself a Freemason, received a deputation of brethren, and suggested a final appeal to Versailles, which was agreed to. The &quot;chief of the executive&quot; hardly listened to the envoys, and declined to further discuss the question of peace with anyone. This last formal challenge having been made and rejected, the Freemasons definitely took their stand as combatants for the Commune.

===Great Schism===
The schism between French and English Freemasonry is popularly supposed to originate at a general assembly of the Grand Orient de France in September 1877. Accepting a recommendation in a report by a Protestant minister, Frédéric Desmons, the assembly, on a majority vote, amended its constitutions to read &quot;Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity&quot;. The words &quot;Its principles are the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and human solidarity&quot; were struck out. The United Grand Lodge of England&#x27;s (UGLE) response was a resolution in March 1878 that &quot;the Grand Lodge, whilst always anxious to receive in the most fraternal spirit the Brethren of any Foreign Grand Lodge whose proceedings are conducted according to the Ancient Landmarks of the Order, of which a belief in T. G. A. O. T. U. (the Great Architect of the Universe) is the first and most important, cannot recognise as &#x27;true and genuine&#x27; Brethren any who have been initiated in Lodges which either deny or ignore that belief&quot;. Relations between the two governing bodies effectively ceased, purportedly because the French body had removed the requirement for a belief in a supreme being. However, UGLE had just entered into fraternal relations with the Grand Orient of Belgium, which had removed the Great Architect from its constitutions in 1872, a relationship which lasted until 1921. The reasons for the split are obviously deeper and more complex than the official records suggest.

Mutual distrust between English and French Freemasons was apparent in the 1850s, when French Masonic refugees were appalled at the relationship between UGLE and the Monarchy, aristocracy, and the Anglican church. The English distrusted the mysticism of French Masonry, and its ideals of Fraternity and Universality.

Desmons&#x27; review had been prompted by the Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875. Eleven countries were represented at an attempt to unify the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. An agreement on colonial lodges would have seen the UGLE as the only recognised masonic grand lodge in British colonies, in spite of the Scottish and Irish lodges already flourishing there. The Scottish delegate, Mackersy, who also represented Greece, withdrew. His letter of withdrawal cited his jurisdiction&#x27;s disagreement with any shift from the requirement for a member to believe in a personal god. He said that he believed the congress would agree to a non-requirement, or the specification of a vague universal principle. In avoiding ratifying a treaty which would obliterate Scottish lodges in the colonies, Mackersy sparked a debate that led to the removal of a requirement for an open volume of scripture in French lodges. The English interpretation of this as a slide towards atheism was probably partly prompted by the difficult political relationship between Britain and France at that time.

The gulf between UGLE and GOdF widened due to the French body&#x27;s active engagement in politics, on a personal and organisational level. All discussion of politics and religion is expressly banned from English lodges.

====Legacy of the Schism====
During the First World War, many American lodges relaxed their opposition to the Grand Orient de France to allow servicemen to engage with other masons while in France. Many of these continue to allow their members to associate with continental Freemasons.

In December 1913, UGLE recognised a new Grand Lodge in France. The basis of this recognition was the series of obligations that the &quot;Independent and Regular National Grand Lodge of France&quot; (later the Grande Loge Nationale Française) imposed on its lodges. These were:
# While the Lodge is at work the Bible will always be open on the altar.
# The ceremonies will be conducted in strict conformity with the Ritual of the &quot;Regime Rectifié&quot; which is followed by these Lodges, a Ritual which was drawn up in 1778 and sanctioned in 1782, and with which the Duke of Kent was initiated in 1792.
# The Lodge will always be opened and closed with invocation and in the name of the Great Architect of the Universe. All the summonses of the Order and of the Lodges will be printed with the symbols of the Great Architect of the Universe.
# No religious or political discussion will be permitted in the Lodge.
# The Lodge as such will never take part officially in any political affair but every individual Brother will preserve complete liberty of opinion and action.
# Only those Brethren who are recognised as true Brethren by the Grand Lodge of England will be received in Lodge.

These &quot;basic principles&quot; were accepted by UGLE itself in 1929, and written into its constitutions.

===Freemasonry in the Middle East===
Freemasonry was introduced in Egypt as early as 1790s during the French campaigns of Syria and Egypt. In Turkey, Freemasonry was popular amongst the Levantine merchants during the same era. After the failure of the 1830 Italian revolution, a number of Italian Freemasons were forced to flee. They secretly set up an approved chapter of Scottish Rite in Alexandria, a town already inhabited by a large Italian community. Meanwhile, the French freemasons publicly organised a local chapter in Alexandria in 1845. During the 19th and 20th century Ottoman empire, Masonic lodges operated widely across all parts of the empire and numerous Sufi orders shared a close relationship with them. Many Young Turks affiliated with the Bektashi order were members and patrons of freemasonry. They were also closely allied against European imperialism. Many Ottoman intellectuals believed that Sufism and Freemasonry shared close similarities in doctrines, spiritual outlook and mysticism.

One of major Arab Muslim scholarly figures notable for promoting the cause of Freemasonry was the Algerian &#x27;Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza&#x27;iri who admitted his three sons into Masonry. He spoke highly of Masons and their universalist efforts. In his visit to Alexandria in June 1864, the Freemasons of Alexandria welcomed &#x27;Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s arrival. The Lodge of Pyramids specifically convened a ceremony in the 18th of June, to mark his arrival. In addition to being a distinguished religious scholar, &#x27;Abd al-Qadir had committed himself to promote the ideals of a society established on Universal Brotherhood. &#x27;Abd al Qadir was initiated into the Mysteries and honoured as the &quot;Fellow of the Prophet&quot;, in addition to the previous privilege of being &quot;a free and accepted Mason&quot;. After the occasion and a short stay in the city, &#x27;Abd al-Qadir left for Syria by the end of July 1864; to take possession of a large property of land in Syria presented to him by the Viceroy of Egypt.

===Taxil hoax===
Between the years 1885 and 1897, Léo Taxil maintained a hoax against both Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church, by making increasingly outlandish claims regarding Freemasonry. On 19 April 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he claimed he would introduce the &quot;author&quot; of his books to the press. He instead announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious. Nevertheless, the material is still used on some anti-Masonic websites.

==20th century Freemasonry==
===Freemasonry under totalitarian regimes (1900–present)===

Many twentieth century totalitarian regimes, both Fascist and Communist, have treated Freemasonry as a potential source of opposition due to its secret nature and international connections (not to mention its promotion of religious and political tolerance through its symbolism). It has been alleged by Masonic scholars that the language used by the totalitarian regimes is similar to that used by some modern critics of Freemasonry.

<doc id="215388" wikidata="Q705497" url="?curid=215388" title="Strict liability">
<text>In criminal and civil law, strict liability is a standard of liability under which a person is legally responsible for the consequences flowing from an activity even in the absence of fault or criminal intent on the part of the defendant.

Under the strict liability law, if the defendant possesses anything that is inherently dangerous, as specified under the &quot;ultrahazardous&quot; definition, the defendant is then strictly liable for any damages caused by such possession, no matter how careful the defendant is safeguarding them.

In the field of torts, prominent examples of strict liability may include product liability, abnormally dangerous activities (e.g., blasting), intrusion onto another&#x27;s land by livestock, and ownership of wild animals.

Other than activities specified above (like ownership of wild animals, etc), US courts have historically considered the following activities as &quot;ultrahazardous&quot;:

# storing flammable liquids in quantity in an urban area
# pile driving
# blasting
# crop dusting
# fumigation with cyanide gas
# emission of noxious fumes by a manufacturing plant located in a settled area
# locating oil wells or refineries in populated communities
# test firing solid-fuel rocket motors.

On the other hand, US courts typically rule the following activities as not &quot;ultrahazardous&quot;: parachuting, drunk driving, maintaining power lines, and letting water escape from an irrigation ditch.

In the English system, in reality, responsibility is tailored to the evidentiary system: that is, to the admissibility of defenses and excuses capable of neutralizing the punishability of the actus reus; and therefore the different forms of strict liability can be differentiated according to the defenses allowed by the individual legal systems.

==Tort law==
In tort law, strict liability is the imposition of liability on a party without a finding of fault (such as negligence or tortious intent). The claimant need only prove that the tort occurred and that the defendant was responsible. The law imputes strict liability to situations it considers to be inherently dangerous. It discourages reckless behaviour and needless loss by forcing potential defendants to take every possible precaution. It has the beneficial effect of simplifying and thereby expediting court decisions in these cases, although the application of strict liability may seem unfair or harsh, as in &quot;Re Polemis&quot;.

Under the English law of negligence and nuisance, even where tortious liability is strict, the defendant may sometimes be liable only for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his act or omission.

An early example of strict liability is the rule &quot;Rylands v Fletcher&quot;, where it was held that &quot;any person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape&quot;. If the owner of a zoo keeps lions and tigers, he is liable if the big cats escape and cause damage or injury.

In strict liability situations, although the plaintiff does not have to prove fault, the defendant can raise a defense of absence of fault, especially in cases of product liability, where the defense may argue that the defect was the result of the plaintiff&#x27;s actions and not of the product, that is, no inference of defect should be drawn solely because an accident occurs. If the plaintiff can prove that the defendant &quot;knew&quot; about the defect before the damages occurred, additional punitive damages can be awarded to the victim in some jurisdictions.

The doctrine&#x27;s most famous advocates were Learned Hand, Benjamin Cardozo, and Roger J. Traynor.

Strict liability is sometimes distinguished from absolute liability. In this context, an &quot;actus reus&quot; may be excused from strict liability if due diligence is proved. Absolute liability, however, requires only an &quot;actus reus&quot;.

===Vaccines===
In the United States courts have applied strict liability to vaccines since the Cutter incident in 1955. Some vaccines (e.g. for Lyme disease) have been removed from the market because of unacceptable liability risk to the manufacturer.

The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) was enacted in 1986 to make an exception for childhood vaccines that are required for public school attendance. The NCVIA created a no-fault compensation scheme to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits, and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing legitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too difficult and cost prohibitive.

===Bicycle–motor vehicle collisions===
A form of strict liability has been supported in law in the Netherlands since the early 1990s for bicycle-motor vehicle collisions. In a nutshell, this means that, in a collision between a car and a cyclist, the driver is deemed to be liable to pay damages and his insurer (motor vehicle insurance is mandatory in the Netherlands, while cyclist insurance is not) must pay the full damages, as long as 1) the collision was &quot;unintentional&quot; (i.e. neither party, motorist or cyclist, intentionally crashed into the other), and 2) the cyclist was not in error in some way. Even if a cyclist made an error, &quot;as long as the collision was still unintentional&quot;, the motorist&#x27;s insurance must still pay half of the damages. This does not apply if the cyclist is under 14 years of age, in which case the motorist must pay full damages. If it can be proved that a cyclist &quot;intended&quot; to collide with the car, then the cyclist must pay the damages (or their parents in the case of a minor).

===General aviation===
The trend toward strict liability in the United States during the mid to late 20th century nearly destroyed the small aircraft industry by the mid 1990s. Production had dropped from a peak of 18,000 units per year in 1978 to under only a few hundred by 1993. With a concurrent increase in the cost of liability insurance per airplane rising from $50 in 1962 to $100,000 in 1988, and many underwriters had begun to refuse all new policies.

==Criminal law==
The concept of strict liability is also found in criminal law. Strict liability often applies to vehicular traffic offenses: in a speeding case, for example, whether the defendant knew that the posted speed limit was being exceeded is irrelevant; the prosecutor need only prove that the defendant was driving the vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit.

In the United States, strict liability can be determined by looking at the intent of the legislature. If the legislature seems to have purposefully left out a mental state element (&quot;mens rea&quot;) because they felt mental state need not be proven, it is treated as a strict liability. However, when a statute is silent as to the mental state (&quot;mens rea&quot;) and it is not clear that the legislature purposely left it out, the ordinary presumption is that a mental state is required for criminal liability. When no &quot;mens rea&quot; is specified, under the Model Penal Code (MPC), the default &quot;mens rea&quot; requirement is recklessness, which the MPC defines as &quot;when a person consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk with respect to a material element&quot;.

Strict liability laws can also prevent defendants from raising diminished mental capacity defenses, since intent does not need to be proven.

In the English case of &quot;Sweet v Parsley&quot; (1970), it was held that where a statute creating a crime made no reference to intention, then &quot;mens rea&quot; would be imputed by the court, so that the crime would not be one of strict liability.

<doc id="215391" wikidata="Q885412" url="?curid=215391" title="Concurrence">
<text>In Western jurisprudence, concurrence (also contemporaneity or simultaneity) is the apparent need to prove the simultaneous occurrence of both (&quot;guilty action&quot;) and (&quot;guilty mind&quot;), to constitute a crime; except in crimes of strict liability. In theory, if the does not hold concurrence in point of time with the then no crime has been committed.

==Discussion==
Suppose for example that the accused accidentally injures a pedestrian while driving. Aware of the collision, the accused rushes from the car only to find that the victim is a hated enemy. At this point, the accused joyfully proclaims his pleasure at having caused the injury. The conventional rule is that no crime has been committed. The &quot;actus reus&quot; is complete, and no rule of ratification applies in the criminal law. Whereas in the law of agency, a principal may retrospectively adopt a transaction as if the agent had originally been authorised to conclude an agreement with a third party (&quot;ratification&quot; of the agent&#x27;s decision), and so acquires liability under that agreement, an alleged criminal cannot retrospectively adopt an &quot;actus reus&quot; and acquire guilt. To be convicted, the accused must have formed the &quot;mens rea&quot; either before or during the commission of the &quot;actus reus&quot;. In the vast majority of cases, this rule works without difficulty.

;Two types of concurrence in criminal law
#Temporal concurrence – the &quot;actus reus&quot; and &quot;mens rea&quot; occur at the same time.
#Motivational concurrence – the &quot;mens rea&quot; motivates the &quot;actus reus&quot;.

==The problem==
Not all events are limited to a particular moment in time. The normal physical rules of cause and effect may see a series of interlocking circumstances conspire to cause a particular injury. If the facts of the example above are slightly changed so that the accident occurs at night at a sharp bend on a very quiet country road; when the driver sees the victim lying in the road he simply leaves the unconscious person where he fell. Some hours later, when a second car innocently comes around the corner and kills the victim, the first driver is happily asleep in his bed. Thus, he argues that, at the time of the death, he had no &quot;mens rea&quot; and so cannot be guilty of homicide. This argument fails because of the so-called &quot;Single Transaction Principle&quot;.

==Single transaction principle==
Not all acts forming the basis of an &quot;actus reus&quot; are single, unconnected events. If a sequence of events is inevitably linked, it may be viewed as a single transaction. So long as the requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; is formed before the sequence begins, or during the sequence (before it ends), the accused will be liable.

In the previous example, the victim would not have died if the first driver had not abandoned him at a dangerous point on the road. The law will treat the &quot;actus reus&quot; as having started with the accidental injury and ended with the death. In &quot;Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner&quot; (1969) 1 QB 439, a police officer ordered the defendant to park his car and he reluctantly complied. In doing so, he accidentally drove the car on to the policeman&#x27;s foot and, when the policeman said &quot;Get off my foot&quot;, said &quot;Fuck you, you can wait&quot; and turned off the ignition. Because of the steel toe cap in his boot, the policeman&#x27;s foot was not in actual danger, but the Divisional Court held that this could constitute a common assault. Albeit accidentally, the driver had caused the car to rest on the foot. This &quot;actus reus&quot; was a continuing state of affairs for so long as the car rested on the officer&#x27;s foot and the &quot;mens rea&quot; was formed before the car was removed. Whether realistically or not, the officer apprehended the possibility of injury so the offence of common assault was complete.

A different way of justifying liability in this type of situation would be to consider an omission at the point in time that the &quot;mens rea&quot; is formed. In the first example, liability arises from the reckless omission to move the man, or willful blindness that he was in danger. In &quot;Fagan&quot;, liability arises from omitting to remove the car.

But not every factual sequence can be so conveniently recast as an omission. Suppose, for example, that A sees his enemy, B, and decides to attack him. A picks up a stick and begins to chase B who runs into a hotel, up the stairs and into a room, locking the door behind him. A hammers at the door, shouting threats. A then sees a fire axe in a glass case nearby. He tells B that he is going for the axe and will break down the door. When A walks away, B is so terrified that he jumps out of the window and breaks his legs. Even though A might not have had an immediate intention to injure B at the critical moment when B jumped, the fear was inspired with an appropriate intention and B would not have been desperate enough to jump had it not been for that fear. [It is fair to exclude liability when B&#x27;s fear is entirely unreasonable given A&#x27;s behaviour because B&#x27;s self-induced injury will break the chain of causation].

This latter example raises a separate issue which is that it is sufficient to base a conviction on the presence of &quot;mens rea&quot; at some time during the occurrence of the events comprising the single transaction. The fact that the accused might mistakenly believe they have succeeded in the crime does not prevent a conviction. For example, suppose that A begins to strangle B and, believing B to be dead, abandons the &quot;body&quot; in nearby woods where B dies of exposure. A will still be convicted of the homicide even though the relevant behaviour of abandoning the body was not accompanied by a &quot;mens rea&quot;.

And for the sake of completeness, if A commits an offence with an &quot;actus reus&quot; and a &quot;mens rea&quot;, it will not affect liability that A subsequently repents the crime and effects restitution. Thus, if A steals goods from B but then returns them together with some money to make good the damage caused during the forced entry, this cannot change the fact that there was an &quot;actus reus&quot; accompanied by an appropriate &quot;mens rea&quot;. A crime was committed although the subsequent conscience-based behaviour would be a relevant consideration during the sentencing stage of the trial.

==English case law examples==
*&quot;Thabo Meli v R&quot; (1954) 1 All ER 373 (PC) Four defendants intended to kill their victim so they induced him to consume alcohol, struck him on the head and threw the &quot;body&quot; over a cliff to make the death appear accidental. Because they thought that the blow had killed him, there was no &quot;mens rea&quot; when they abandoned him and he died from exposure. The first act did not cause death but had the appropriate &quot;mens rea&quot;. The second act caused death but had no &quot;mens rea&quot;. But the Privy Council held that it was impossible to divide up what was really one transaction. The &quot;actus reus&quot; was said to be the series of acts and omissions with &quot;mens rea&quot; covering the initial stages. 
*In &quot;R v Church&quot; (1965) 2 AER 72 during an argument, the defendant struck the victim and, mistakenly believing her to be dead, threw her into a nearby river where she drowned. He was convicted of manslaughter.
*In &quot;R v LeBrun&quot; (1991) 4 All ER 673, the defendant struck his wife during an argument outside their house leaving her unconscious. He then tried to drag her inside but, as he did so, her head struck the pavement, fracturing her skull and killing her. At first sight, this is distinguishable from &quot;R v Church&quot; because death was accidental, whereas Church was intentionally disposing of the &quot;body&quot;. But, in attempting to drag his unconscious wife indoors, LeBrun was either trying to conceal his initial assault on her, or forcing her to enter the house against her wishes (this being the original reason for the argument). The trial judge had directed the jury to acquit if they concluded that LeBrun had been trying to help his wife when he moved her, and the Court of Appeal agreed that this would have broken the essential nexus between the two halves of the incident.
*In &quot;AG&#x27;s Reference (No. 4 of 1980)&quot; (1981) 2 All ER 617 the defendant was struggling with his girlfriend and she fell over a landing rail on to the floor below. Believing her dead, he dismembered her in the bath to dispose of her &quot;body&quot;. It was impossible to prove whether she had died in the original fall or whether he killed her by his subsequent actions. The Court of Appeal held that a manslaughter conviction was only possible if each of the defendant&#x27;s acts was accompanied by the requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; for that offence. At the very least, there must be an unlawful act which was the cause of the ultimate death. It was not enough to establish criminal negligence only in the subsequent act of disposal. Hence, the prosecution had to disprove D&#x27;s claim of accident, i.e. that he had merely pushed her away in a &quot;reflex action&quot; when she dug her nails into him in the struggle on the upstairs landing.
*&quot;Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner&quot; [1968] 3 All ER 442 The defendant accidentally drove his car onto a policeman&#x27;s foot whilst the policeman was directing traffic, but then subsequently refused to move off during an argument with the policeman. It was held that the &quot;actus reus&quot; was not the single act of driving onto the foot, but continued as long as the car remained there. Once the defendant subsequently acquired the &quot;mens rea&quot; to harm the policeman, the crime was complete.

<text>Michael Anthony Jackson (born 16 February 1936) is a British computer scientist, and independent computing consultant in London, England. He is also a visiting research professor at the Open University in the UK.

==Biography==
Born in Birmingham to Montagu M. Jackson and Bertha (Green) Jackson, Jackson was educated at Harrow School in Harrow, London, England. There he was taught by Christopher Strachey and wrote his first program under Strachey&#x27;s guidance. From 1954 to 1958, he studied classics (known as &quot;Greats&quot;) at Merton College, Oxford; a fellow student, two years ahead of him, was C. A. R. Hoare. They shared an interest in logic, which was studied as part of Greats at Oxford.

After his graduation in 1961, Jackson started as computer science designer and consultant for Maxwell Stamp Associates in London. Here he designed, coded and tested his first programs for IBM and Honeywell computers, working in assembler. There Jackson found his calling, as he recollected in 2000: &quot;Although I was a careful designer — drawing meticulous flowcharts before coding — and a conscientious tester, I realised that program design was hard and the results likely to be erroneous...&quot; Information system design was in need of a structured approach. 

In 1964, Jackson joined the new consultancy firm John Hoskyns and Company in London, before founding his own company Michael Jackson Systems Limited in 1971. In the 1960s, he had started his search for a &quot;more reliable and systematic way of programming.&quot; He contributed to the emerging modular programming movement, meeting Larry Constantine, George H. Mealy and several others on a 1968 symposium. In the 1970s, Jackson developed Jackson Structured Programming (JSP). In the 1980s, with John Cameron, he developed Jackson System Development (JSD). Then, in the 1990s, he developed the Problem Frames Approach. 

As a part-time researcher at AT&amp;T Labs Research, in collaboration with Pamela Zave, Jackson created &quot;Distributed Feature Composition&quot;, a virtual architecture for specification and implementation of telecommunication services.

Jackson received the Stevens Award for Software Development Methods in 1997. and British Computer Society Lovelace Medal in 1998. He received the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award in 2001.

In 1961, Jackson married Judith Wendy Blackburn; they have four sons, one of whom, Daniel, is also a computer scientist based at MIT.

==Work==
Jackson has developed a series of methods. Each of these methods covers a wider scope than the previous one, and builds on ideas that appeared, but were not fully developed, in the previous one. Reading his books in sequence allows you to follow the evolution of his thinking.

===Jackson Structured Programming===
Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) was the first software development method that Jackson developed. It is a program design method, and was described in his book &quot;Principles of Program Design&quot;. JSP covers the design of individual programs, but not systems.

===Jackson System Development===
The Jackson System Development (JSD) was the second software development method that Jackson developed. JSD is a system development method not just for individual programs, but for entire systems. JSD is most readily applicable to information systems, but it can easily be extended to the development of real-time embedded systems. JSD was described in his book &quot;System Development&quot;.

===Problem Frames Approach===
Problem Analysis or the Problem Frames Approach was the third software development method that Jackson developed. It concerns itself with aspects of developing all kinds of software, not just information systems. It was first sketched in his book &quot;Software Requirements and Specifications&quot;, and described much more fully in his book &quot;Problem Frames&quot;. The First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames was held as part of ICSE’04 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.

==Publications==
Michael Jackson&#x27;s books include:

<doc id="215395" wikidata="Q4818193" url="?curid=215395" title="Attendant circumstance">
<text>In law, attendant circumstances (sometimes external circumstances) are the facts surrounding an event.

In criminal law in the United States, the definition of a given offense generally includes up to three kinds of &quot;elements&quot;: the , or guilty conduct; the , or guilty mental state; and the attendant (sometimes &quot;external&quot;) circumstances. The reason is given in &quot;Powell v. Texas&quot;, 392 U.S. 514, 533 (1968): ...criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in preventing.
The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove each &quot;element of the offense&quot; in order for a defendant to be found guilty. The Model Penal Code §1.13(9) offers the following definition of the phrase &quot;elements of an offense&quot;:
(i) such conduct or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of conduct as
::(a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense; or
::(b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or
::(c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or
::(d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or
::(e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;

==Discussion==

===MPC §1.13(9)(a)/(c)===
In &quot;United States v. Apfelbaum&quot;, 445 U.S. 115, 131 (1980), Justice Rehnquist states, in his opinion for the Court, the general rule that:
:In the criminal law, both a culpable &quot;mens rea&quot; and a criminal &quot;actus reus&quot; are generally required for an offense to occur.
For these purposes, the term &quot;actus reus&quot; does not have a single definition, but it represents the general principle that before an individual may be convicted of an offense, it must be shown that there was an overt act in pursuance of any intention. Otherwise, a person might be held liable for his or her thoughts alone. Model Penal Code §2.01(1):
:A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.
But there are exceptions. For example, according to &quot;United States v. Dozal&quot;, 173 F.3d 787, 797 (10th Cir. 1999) a conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. §846 consists of four elements:
#an agreement with another person to violate the law,
#knowledge of the essential objectives of the conspiracy,
#knowing and voluntary involvement, and
#interdependence among the alleged conspirators.
But, according to &quot;United States v. Johnson&quot;, 42 F.3d 1312, 1319 (10th Cir. 1994) (citing &quot;United States v. Shabani&quot;, 513 U.S. 10 (1994)) drug conspiracies under 21 U.S.C. §846 are unique because the prosecution need not prove an overt act. Instead, the government must &quot;prove that the defendant knew at least the essential objectives of the conspiracy and knowingly and voluntarily became a part of it.&quot; Consequently, withdrawal before an overt act has been committed cannot relieve a defendant of criminal responsibility. 
When analysing an offense, the normal rules of interpretation require the identification of the policies that informed the creation of the offense, an assessment of the factual context within which the offense must be committed and the consequences prohibited by the law. Thus, as the MPC §1.13(9) definition indicates, the attendant circumstances will be the evidence that must be adduced to prove all the elements required to constitute the offense and, under §1.13(9)(c) to disprove any excuse or justification. So, as in &quot;State of North Carolina v Vernon Jay Raley&quot; 155 NC App 222 (01-1004), if a citizen intentionally utters a profanity at the police, the charges would be preferred under N.C.G.S. §14-288.4 which defines &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; as:
:a public disturbance intentionally caused by a person who:
::(1) Engages in fighting or other violent conduct or in conduct creating the threat of imminent fighting or violence; or
::(2) makes or uses any utterance, gesture, display or abusive language which is intended and plainly likely to provoke violent retaliation and thereby causes a breach of the peace.
Under N.C.G.S. §14-288.4 (2001), the componential element of &quot;public disturbance&quot; is defined in G.S. §14-288.1(8) as follows:
:Any annoying, disturbing, or alarming act or condition exceeding the bounds of social toleration normal for the time and place in question which occurs in a public place or which occurs in, affects persons in, or is likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access. The places covered by this definition shall include, but not be limited to, highways, transport facilities, schools, prisons, apartment houses, places of business or amusement, or any neighborhood.
In order for a person to be found guilty of this crime, the evidence must prove that the defendant uttered a profanity (the act) in a public place (the contextual attendant circumstance) with the intention of provoking a violent reaction (the mental element demonstrating the right type of culpability) and thereby causes a breach of the peace (the result prohibited by law). There are no attendant circumstances that might invoke an excuse or other general defence. Indeed, the victim in this instance being a police officer would probably be considered an &quot;aggravating circumstance&quot; and increase the penalty for the crime. (When verification of an attendant circumstance decreases the penalty, it is known as a &quot;mitigating&quot; or &quot;extenuating circumstance&quot;.)

===MPC §1.13(9)(d)/(e)===
The elements of a crime may also require proof of attendant circumstances that bring the conduct within time for the purposes of any statute of limitation or before an appropriate venue. Such circumstances are completely independent from the &quot;actus reus&quot; or &quot;mens rea&quot; elements. In the federal system, for example, a crime may require proof of jurisdictional facts, which are not defined in the statute creating the offense. See generally LaFave &amp; Scott at 273.3. Thus, the Sixth Amendment calls for trial &quot;by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.&quot; Within the federal court system, Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifies which federal court may hear a particular criminal case:
:Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.
In &quot;United States v. Cabrales&quot;, 118 S. Ct. 1772 (1998) a jurisdiction issue on venue was invoked by the attendant circumstance that the relevant acts of money laundering occurred in Florida where the case was to be tried, but the funds were derived from the unlawful distribution of cocaine in Missouri. The offense is defined as:
:Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity—
:(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or
::(ii) with intent to engage in conduct constituting a violation of section 7201 or 7206 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
:(B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part—
::(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or
::(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,
:shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.
The attendant circumstance of a transborder exercise is not referred to in the definition, but is a critical factual circumstance which will determine whether the accused can be tried as charged. The case was held more properly within the Missouri jurisdiction. This jurisdictional problem would not arise in relation to conspiracy charges.

<text>The pipits are a cosmopolitan genus, Anthus, of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. Along with the wagtails and longclaws, the pipits make up the family Motacillidae. The genus is widespread, occurring across most of the world, except the driest deserts, rainforest and the mainland of Antarctica.

They are slender, often drab, ground-feeding insectivores of open country. Like their relatives in the family, the pipits are monogamous and territorial. Pipits are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled eggs.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The genus &quot;Anthus&quot; was introduced in 1805 by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein. The type species was later designated as the meadow pipit.
The generic name &quot;Anthus&quot; is the Latin word for a small bird of grasslands mentioned by Pliny the Elder.

Molecular studies of the pipits suggested that the genus arose in East Asia around seven million years ago (Mya), during the Miocene, and that the genus had spread to the Americas, Africa, and Europe between 5 and 6 Mya. Speciation rates were high during the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 Mya ), but slowed down during the Pleistocene. Repeated dispersal between continents seems to have been important in generating new species in Eurasia, Africa, and North America, rather than species arising by radiation once a continent was reached. In South America, however, vicariance appears to have played an important role in speciation.

===Extant species===
The genus has more than 40 species, making it the largest genus in terms of numbers in its family. The exact species limits of the genus are still a matter of some debate, with some checklists recognising only 34 species. For example, the Australasian pipit, &quot;A. novaeseelandiae&quot;, which is currently treated as nine subspecies found in New Zealand, Australia, and New Guinea, once also included Richard&#x27;s pipit and the paddyfield pipit of Asia, and the African pipit of Africa. In addition, the Australian and New Zealand populations could be split, or even that New Zealand&#x27;s subspecies found on its outlying Subantarctic Islands be split from the mainland species. In part the taxonomic difficulties arise due to the extreme similarities in appearance across the genus.

The family has an additional species, the golden pipit, &quot;Tmetothylacus tennelus&quot;, which belongs to a distinct, monotypic genus. This species is apparently intermediate in appearance between the pipits and the longclaws, and is probably more closely related to the longclaws. One species, the yellow-breasted pipit, is sometimes split out into a genus &quot;Hemimacronyx&quot;, which is considered to be intermediate between the longclaws and pipits. The split was originally proposed based on morphological features, but it has also found support based upon genetic analysis.

Formerly, some authorities placed the Kakamega greenbul (nominate) in this genus (as &quot;Anthus kakamegae&quot;).

==Description==

The pipits are generally highly conservative in appearance. They are generally in length, although the smallest species, the short-tailed pipit, is only . In weight, they range from . The largest species may be the alpine pipit. Like all members of the family, they are slender, short-necked birds with long tails and long, slender legs with elongated (in some cases very elongated) hind claws. The length of the hind claw varies with the habits of the species, more arboreal species have shorter, more curved hind claws than the more terrestrial species. The bills are generally long, slender, and pointed. In both size and plumage, few differences are seen between the sexes. One unusual feature of the pipits, which they share in common with the rest of their family, but not the rest of the passerines, is that the tertials on the wing entirely cover the primary flight feathers. This is thought to be a feature to protect the primaries, which are important to flight, from the sun, which causes the feathers to fade and become brittle if not protected.

The plumage of the pipits is generally drab and brown, buff, or faded white. The undersides are usually darker than the top, and a variable amount of barring and streaking is seen on the back, wings, and breast. The drab, mottled-brown colours provide some camouflage against the soil and stones on which they are generally found. A few species have slightly more colourful breeding plumages; for example, the rosy pipit has greenish edges on the wing feathers. The yellow-breasted pipit, if it is retained in this genus, is quite atypical in having bright yellow plumage on the throat, breast, and belly.

Pipits are morphologically similar to some larks, but the two groups are quite distantly related; the lark family Alaudidae is part of the superfamily Sylvioidea, rather than the Passeroidea, where the pipits are placed. Morphological differences between the two groups of birds are, in fact, plentiful. Anatomical differences include a differently structured syrinx, differences in the structure of the tarsi, and in many lark genera, the presence of a distinct 10th primary, a fourth tertial, and feathers at least partially covering the nostrils. Bill shape differs between larks and pipits, with larks having an evenly sloping culmen, whereas most pipits have a small hump over the nostrils, and lark bills are generally heavier, reflecting differences in diet. Differences occur in the feather tracts of the two groups; while many larks have crests, no pipit does; pipits have only one prominent row of , whereas larks have two.

==Distribution and habitat==

The pipits have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring across most of the world&#x27;s land surface. They are the only genus in their family to occur widely in the Americas (two species of wagtails marginally occur in Alaska, as well). Three species of pipits occur in North America, and seven species occur in South America. The remaining species are spread throughout Eurasia, Africa, and Australia, along with two species restricted to islands in the Atlantic. Some six species occur on more than one continent.
As might be expected from a genus with such a wide distribution, the pipits are found in an equally wide range of habitats. They occur in most types of open habitat, although they are absent from the very driest deserts. They are mostly associated with some kind of grassland, from sea-level to alpine tundra. The rock pipit and South Georgia pipit are found in the rocks and cliffs of the seashore, whereas several species are restricted (for part of the year in some cases) to alpine areas. The family also ranges from the northern tundra and the subantarctic islands of New Zealand and the South Georgia group to the tropics. They are absent from tropical rainforest, but a few species are associated with open woodland, for example the wood pipit of southern Africa, which is found in open woodland savanna and miombo woodland.

The pipits range from entirely sedentary to entirely migratory. Insular species such as Berthelot&#x27;s pipit, which is endemic to Madeira and the Canary Islands, are entirely sedentary, as are some species in warmer areas like the Nilgiri pipit. Other species are partly nomadic during the nonbreeding season, like the long-legged pipit of central Africa or the ochre-breasted pipit of South America. These seasonal movements are in response to conditions in the environment, and are poorly understood and unpredictable. Longer, more regular migrations between discrete breeding and wintering grounds are undertaken by several species. The tree pipit, which breeds in Europe and northern Asia, winters in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, a pattern of long-distance migration shared with other northerly species. Species may also be partly migratory, with northern populations being migratory but more temperate populations being resident (such as the meadow pipit in Europe). The distances involved do not have to be that long; the mountain pipit of southern Africa breeds in the Drakensberg of South Africa and migrates north only as far as Angola and Zambia. Migration is usually undertaken in groups and may happen both during the day and at night. Some variation happens in this, for example, Sprague&#x27;s pipit of North America apparently only migrates by day.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The pipits are active terrestrial birds that usually spend most of their time on the ground. They will fly in order to display during breeding, while migrating and dispersing, and also when flushed by danger. A few species make use of trees, perching in them and flying to them when disturbed. Low shrubs, rocks and termite nests may also be used as vantage points. Like their relatives the wagtails, pipits engage in tail-wagging. The way in which a pipit does this can provide clues to its identity in otherwise similar looking species. Upland pipits, for example, flick their tails quite quickly, as opposed to olive-backed pipits which wag their tails more gently. In general pipits move their tails quite slowly. The buff-bellied pipit wags its tail both up and down and from side to side. The exact function of tail-wagging is unclear; in the related wagtails it is thought to be a signal to predators of vigilance.

===Feeding===
The diet of the pipits is dominated by small invertebrates. Insects are the most important prey items; among the types taken include flies and their larvae, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets, true bugs, mantids, ants, aphids and particularly the larvae and adults of moths and butterflies. Outside of insects other invertebrates taken include spiders and, rarely, worms and scorpions. They are generally catholic in their diet, the composition of their diet apparently reflecting the abundance of their prey in the location (and varying with the season). The diet consumed by adults may vary to that of the young birds; for example adult tree pipits take large numbers of beetles but do not feed many to their chicks. Species feeding on the seashore are reported to feed on marine crustaceans and molluscs. A few species have been reported to feed on small fish, beating them in the manner of a kingfisher having caught them. Rock pipits have also been observed feeding on fish dropped by puffins. These fish, which include sand eels and rocklings, were dropped by puffins being harassed by gulls. A few species also are reported as consuming berries and seeds.

<text>Motherwell Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, which plays in the Scottish Premiership. Motherwell have not dropped out of the top flight of Scottish football since 1985, and have lifted one trophy in that time – the Scottish Cup in 1991.

Clad in their traditional claret and amber, Motherwell play their home matches at Fir Park and have done so since 1896. The club&#x27;s main rivals over the years have been Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians, due in part to their close geographical proximities. These matches are known as the Lanarkshire derby.

The club have won four major trophies in domestic football: the Scottish League title in 1931–32, the Scottish Cup in 1951–52 and 1990–91, and the Scottish League Cup in 1950–51.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has suggested Motherwell F.C.&#x27;s fans as the originators of the &quot;Viking Thunder Clap&quot;, a supporting chant eventually popularised by the fans of the Iceland national football team, where fans stay silent and let out loud synchronised claps seconds apart, gradually speeding up; the chant received wider international attention during Euro 2016.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Motherwell FC was born on 17 May 1886, when representatives of the two main Motherwell works teams Glencairn FC and Alpha F.C. met in Baillie&#x27;s pub in the town&#x27;s Merry Street, and decided to merge the two teams with the aim of creating a club to represent the town as a whole at a higher footballing level. Motherwell&#x27;s debut fixture proved to be a successful one as they overcame Hamilton Academical 3–2.

The early years proved somewhat chaotic as the club had little regular competition to play in, and matches would often start with players short, as men failed to turn up on time after their shifts in the local ironworks. On 5 August 1893 the decision was made to turn professional, and the club was consequently elected to the league, then being the only Lanarkshire side to compete at national level.

Up until 1895 the club had played at a few different venues, including a site at Roman Road, and Dalziel Park. The small pitch and muddy conditions at Dalziel Park were deemed unsuitable and Lord Hamilton granted a lease on a plot of land on his Dalzell estate. This new ground was named Fir Park and has remained the club&#x27;s home for over 120 years.

The following years saw the club grow, appointing their first and longest serving manager to date, John &#x27;Sailor&#x27; Hunter, who would go on to steer the club into its most successful period.

In 1913 the decision was made to change the club&#x27;s colours from blue to the now signature claret and amber. It is thought this was inspired by the success of Bradford City, who also sport claret and amber, although a more romantic version of events claims them to have been Lord Hamilton of Dalzell&#x27;s racing colours.

===1920s and 1930s successes===

Motherwell enjoyed a successful period in the aftermath of World War I, managed by John Hunter. The club placed third in the 1919–20 season and, although narrowly avoiding relegation in 1924–25, they steadily climbed the table and enjoyed seven successive seasons finishing in the top three.

In the summer of 1927, the club made a very successful tour of Spain, winning six out of the eight games they played and losing only one. These results included an emphatic 3–1 victory over Real Madrid and a 2–2 draw with Barcelona. Following their success in Spain, the club went on another summer tour, this time of South America. After losing only three of their previous ten games, the tour culminated in a 5–0 defeat by a Brazilian League Select side.

Motherwell&#x27;s first (and to this day, only) Scottish League championship came in 1931–32 – with 30 wins in 38 fixtures, scoring 119 goals – a record 52 of which were scored by Willie MacFadyen, who remains to this day the record holder for most goals scored in a single season and one of the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorers with 251 goals. The championship was sealed on 23 April 1932, when Rangers could only draw at home against Clyde, handing Motherwell the title without kicking a ball. Between 1904 and 1947, this was also the only League title won by a club outside the Old Firm. In the two seasons following the league title win (1933–34 and 1934–35), &#x27;Well finished runners-up, as they had also been in 1926–27 and 1929–30. They also contested three Scottish Cup finals in this period – in 1931, 1933 and 1939, but lost them all.

===Post-World War II period===

Following the break-up of the squad after World War II, the club were not instantly successful. It then captured two major trophies in as many years with victories in the 1950 Scottish League Cup final and the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The club was then relegated for the first time ever at the end of the 1952–53 season, but the club were promoted the next year.

Following their return to the First Division, Bobby Ancell took management of the club in 1955 and presided over an era in which highly regarded Scotland stars including Ian St John and Charlie Aitken played for the club. However, Motherwell were unable to keep their assets, and no trophies were won in Ancell&#x27;s era. His resignation came in 1965 amidst a downturn in form which eventually saw the club relegated back to the Second Division at the conclusion of the 1967–68 season.

===1970s recovery and the McLean era===

Motherwell were immediately promoted back to the First Division in 1969, maintaining a mid-table position. The 18-team First Division was superseded by a new 10-team Premier League for the 1975–76 season, at which time they were managed by Willie McLean and his assistant Craig Brown (who would become manager almost 35 years later). Under their management, Motherwell improved to fourth in the table with players such as Bobby Graham, Willie Pettigrew and Bobby Watson. The most notable cup run of that period was the 1975–76 Scottish Cup where they eliminated Celtic and lost out in the semi-final to Rangers.

===1980 and 90s===

Relegation down to the now-First Division and promotion back to the Premier League occurred twice in the early 1980s, before a decade under manager Tommy McLean (brother of Willie) culminated in a Scottish Cup win in 1991. However, similarly to the Ancell era, Scotland internationalist Tom Boyd was sold in the close season after the cup win. Results faded for two years before reaching another two season zenith immediately following the signing of Paul Lambert with third (1993–94) and second-placed (1994–95) Premier League finishes. The 1995 runners-up finish was the club&#x27;s highest finish since 1933–34.

With Tommy McLean&#x27;s departure to Hearts in 1994, much of his squad was broken up; a large fee in particular was paid by Celtic for Phil O&#x27;Donnell. Much of this money was reinvested in the squad, while the club cycled through managers including Alex McLeish and Harri Kampman. At this point, in August 1998, John Boyle bought the club, taking over from John Chapman. Billy Davies was appointed as manager, and large transfer fees were paid for prominent players including ex-Scotland internationals John Spencer and Andy Goram. The investment though failed to provide results on the pitch.

===2000–2009===
By the end of Davies&#x27; tenure the club were in financial trouble. Eric Black was briefly in charge with the club floating near the foot of the table before it was placed in administration in April 2002 with losses approaching GBP 2 million yearly. Black resigned, and was replaced by Terry Butcher. The club&#x27;s outlook remained bleak as they were forced to make redundant or release 19 players and replace them with younger players; Boyle also placed the club up for sale. Relegation in 2002–03 – normally automatic following a last-place finish in the league – was avoided on a technicality, as First Division winners Falkirk lacked a stadium meeting Premier League regulations.
Despite the lack of resources, a number of young talented players were found to play for the club; crucially, when many of these moved on, including Stephen Pearson and James McFadden, they brought revenue in the form of transfer fees, and with John Boyle waiving the club&#x27;s personal debt to him, its financial future was assured by the conclusion of the 2004–05 season with the club&#x27;s yearly losses falling to one of the lowest figures in the Premier League and the club coming out of administration in time to avoid a ten-point Premier League penalty which was being phased in for teams in administration. On the field, the club also managed to reach the League Cup final, although they were comprehensively defeated by Rangers. Butcher moved on to Sydney FC at the end of the 2005–06 season, and was succeeded by his assistant Maurice Malpas. Malpas&#x27; stint at the club lasted just one season before his resignation in May 2007. After a short period with Scott Leitch as caretaker manager, Mark McGhee was appointed to the position. In his first season as manager McGhee would take the club to 3rd in the league and thus qualify for the UEFA Cup for the first time in 13 years where they would be beaten by French side AS Nancy 3–0 on aggregate. Mark McGhee left Motherwell for the vacant managerial position at Aberdeen in June 2009 to be replaced by Jim Gannon. Former Scotland manager Craig Brown took over when Gannon left.

===2010–present===
Brown helped the club finish 5th in the SPL and qualify for Europe. The 2010–11 season saw the club in the Europa League and they defeated Breiðablik and Aalesunds before losing in the Play-off round to Odense preventing them from reaching the group stages of the competition. Brown left Motherwell for Aberdeen on 10 December 2010. Stuart McCall was named as his successor. This season saw the club reach the Scottish Cup Final where they were defeated 3–0 by Celtic.

The 2011–12 season saw Motherwell reach the qualifying round of the Champions League for the first time. They finished third, one place outside the normal two spots allocated to the SPL for the Champions League. However the club was awarded a place because the club that had finished above them, Rangers, went into administration and were prevented by UEFA from playing in European competitions. In the draw for the 3rd qualification round of the Champions League Motherwell were drawn against Greek heavyweights Panathanaikos. This ended in disappointment as Motherwell were knocked out after losing 2–0 at home and then 3–0 away. The 2012–13 season brought even greater success in the SPL as the club finished 2nd in the table and once again qualified for the Europa League. It also saw striker Michael Higdon win the PFA Scotland Players&#x27; Player of the Year award. Goalkeeper Darren Randolph (second year running), defender Shaun Hutchinson and midfielder Nicky Law were selected for the PFA Scotland Team of the Year.

Motherwell were granted associate membership of the European Club Association in June 2013, becoming the fifth Scottish club to join the Association. The club were invited to join after consistent qualification for European competition between 2008 and 2013. In season 2013–14 Motherwell were knocked out of the Europa League by Russian side Kuban Krasnodar 3–0 on aggregate in the third qualifying round. On 22 January 2014 Motherwell won their 40th Lanarkshire cup beating Hamilton Academical 1–0 thanks to a 54th-minute goal by 19-year-old youngster Jack Leitch. On the final day of the 2013–14 Scottish Premiership, Motherwell won 1–0 at Aberdeen with a dramatic 93rd-minute winner, leapfrogging Aberdeen in the process to seal a second successive runners-up spot in the league. Despite conceding the most goals (60) out of the top six teams, European football was delivered for the sixth time in seven seasons, with a record points total (70). It was a season that also saw a first ever competitive defeat to Lanarkshire neighbours Albion Rovers, sitting third bottom of Scottish League Two at the time, 1–0 in the Scottish Cup.

Despite three successful consecutive league campaigns, Motherwell made a poor start to the 2014–15 Scottish Premiership, which ultimately led to the resignation of manager Stuart McCall on 2 November 2014. Despite the appointment of Ian Baraclough in December 2014, Motherwell were eventually consigned to a Scottish Premiership relegation play-off spot after a defeat at St Mirren in the penultimate league match of the 2014–15 season.
In the 2014–15 relegation play-off finals, Motherwell faced Rangers. The first leg, at Rangers&#x27; home ground, Ibrox Stadium, saw Motherwell run out as winners with a score of 1–3. In the second leg, Motherwell celebrated staying in the top division by winning, 3–0. On 23 September 2015, Motherwell parted ways with manager Ian Baraclough. Mark McGhee returned in October 2015 before being sacked in March 2017 after a poor run of results.

On 28 October 2016, Motherwell became a fan-owned club when supporters club Well Society&#x27;s £1 deal with Les Hutchison was concluded. On 13 October 2017, Manager Stephen Robinson extended his contract until May 2020. On 31 December 2020, Robinson resigned as manager, with Keith Lasley taking interim charge.

In Popular Culture and Literature

In the crime novel &quot;The Greenock Murders&quot; by Kieran James (2021), a 10-year-old autistic boy, Wee Robbie, moves from Motherwell to Greenock with his family. He refuses to give up his support of Motherwell FC despite repeated abuse and bullying. In the closing stages of the novel, Motherwell defeat Rangers 2–1 in a fictional 2022 Scottish Cup Final, involving real players&#x27; names on both sides.

==Records and statistics==
The club has won four major trophies in its history: the First Division in 1931–32, the Scottish Cup in 1952 and 1991, and the Scottish League Cup in 1950. In addition, it has won the second-tier Scottish league on four occasions; as the Second Division in 1953–54 and 1968–69, and as the First Division (beneath the Premier League) in 1981–82 and 1984–85. They also won the Milk Cup in 1983, and the Scottish Summer Cup in 1944 and 1965.

Bob Ferrier holds the record for the number of Motherwell appearances, with 626 in the inter-war period. The goalscoring record is held by Hughie Ferguson, who scored 284 league goals in 10 seasons in the 1910s and 1920s. Willie MacFadyen&#x27;s 52 goals in the title-winning 1931–32 season remains a club (and country) record for goals in one season.

The club&#x27;s record European appearance holder is Steven Hammell, with 19 appearances for the club in Europe. The current record European goalscorer is Jamie Murphy, with seven goals. Also, the 8–1 win over Flamurtari on 23 July 2009 currently stands as their record victory in European competition.

Fir Park&#x27;s current safety certificate limits the capacity to 13,742, all-seated in accordance with the Taylor Report although the ground is listed as . Its average home gate for the 2018–19 season was 5,448. The club&#x27;s record attendance for a home match is 35,632, against Rangers in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay on 12 March 1952, but as season ticket holders were not counted at the time, the true attendance would be over 37,000.

Motherwell&#x27;s biggest win was a 12–1 victory over Dundee United in 1954, with the club&#x27;s heaviest defeat being the 8–0 loss to Aberdeen in 1979.

On 5 May 2010, Motherwell were involved in the highest scoring match in the SPL, drawing 6–6 with Hibernian at Fir Park, with Lukas Jutkiewicz scoring the equaliser in the 91st minute. This eclipsed another high-scoring game involving Motherwell, a 6–5 defeat by Aberdeen on 20 October 1999.
The record transfer fee paid by the club was to Everton for John Spencer in 1999 (£500,000) and the highest received was David Turnbull for his move to Celtic in 2020 (£3.25m), eclipsing the 1.75m paid for previous record holder Phil O&#x27;Donnell in 1994. O&#x27;Donnell rejoined Motherwell in 2004, but his second spell at Fir Park ended when he died after collapsing on the pitch in a game against Dundee United on 29 December 2007.

Stephen Craigan holds the record for the most-capped player at the club, with 54 caps in total, 51 as a Motherwell player – Northern Ireland.

===Player of the Year===
The Supporters Association first handed out the award in April 1956. The first winner of the award was Andy Paton, who received a silver cup from Sailor Hunter at a dinner dance in Overton Miners Welfare. Paton was further honoured in 2007 when he was declared the &quot;Greatest Ever&quot; Motherwell player.

Joe Wark and Keith Lasley are the only men to win the award three separate times. Charlie Aitken was the first of five players to win the award back-to-back, with Louis Moult being the last player to do this.

==Sponsorship==
Motherwell were sponsored in the 2019–20 season by online gambling company Paddy Power as part of their &#x27;Save our Shirt&#x27; campaign&#x27;. This followed Bet Park sponsoring the side in a deal running since the start of the 2018–19 season. Commsworld was the principal sponsor from the 2010–11 season. Due to the sponsorship deal not being agreed in time for the start of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League the team briefly featured &quot;www.chooselife.net&quot; as their main shirt sponsor. The team continue to carry suicide prevention sponsorship on the arms of the shirt. They have also been sponsored by the local IT firm Log in to Learn, which appeared on the back of the shirts. For the 2009–10 season the team were sponsored by JAXX, a German gambling company. They in turn had replaced Anglian Home Improvements, who were the club&#x27;s shirt sponsor from 2006 to 2008. Previous to this the club had been sponsored by Zoom Airlines, who were part-owned by club director John Boyle, and who retained advertising space on both the Davie Cooper Stand and the South Stand until they ceased trading in August 2008.

The sponsor from 2002 to 2004 was a local company called The Untouchables. Previously the club had enjoyed a long-term association with Motorola, but this ended after 11 years in 2002 as the sponsor started to reduce its manufacturing operations in Scotland. This had in turn followed another long-term association with local car dealer Ian Skelly, who had sponsored the club since 1984.

The club have had a number of different kit manufacturers since the 1970s. At present the official kit supplier is Macron who were newly announced for the 2014–15 season to replace Puma after their 3-year deal with the club expired. Previously the club kits were supplied by New-Zealand based sporting goods manufacturer Canterbury who were announced as the official kit supplier to Motherwell for the four years beginning with the 2009–10 season, taking over from Bukta. However, Canterbury went into administration after less than one year of the contract had been completed. Major manufacturers Adidas, Admiral, Hummel, Patrick, Pony, Umbro and Xara have all been kit providers for Motherwell.

<doc id="215399" wikidata="Q2464750" url="?curid=215399" title="Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani">
<text>Qutb-ul Aqtaab Naqib Al Ashraaf Syed Abd ar-Rahman al-Qadri al-Gillani (; 11 January 1841 – 13 June 1927) was the first prime minister of Iraq. He was an important figure during the Ottoman and the British Eras, and he had an important role in the politics of Iraq.

== Early life ==
Al-Gillani was born in Baghdad to a Sufi family. Al-Gillani was the 15th descendant of Abdul Qadir al-Gillani. His family has been known since ancient times for its scientific significance and councilmen and was known for his morality and love for his people. He was the captain of the Banu Hashim of the Quraishi tribe in Baghdad. He lived most of his life as an Ottoman and studied under Sultan Abdul Hamid II who strongly supported him on the issue of Palestine when he was young.

== Political career ==
Al-Gillani was chosen in 1920 to head the Iraqi Council of Ministers following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Due to his good relations with the British and his personality, he was one of the candidates for the throne of Iraq. He refused to take the title out of renunciation of the King but agreed to be prime minister. He used his influence to oppose the appointment of Faisal I as King of Iraq and resigned from his post when his efforts were defeated. Nevertheless, Faisal still reappointed him as prime minister in order to curb opposition. Even though Al-Gillani was reinstated, his powers were greatly diminished as the king and the British took more prominent roles in appointing ministers and other government officials. 

In 1922, al-Gillani negotiated the first Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which ensured nominal independence for the country, though Britain maintained control of the military and foreign affairs, essentially establishing a Mandate in the country. Opposed to these results, al-Gillani resigned shortly after and spent the rest of his life in seclusion.

== Death and Burial ==
Al-Gillani died on 13 June 1927 in Baghdad, aged 86. His funeral was attended by many high figures of Iraq including Prince Ghazi. He was buried inside the Mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gillani shrine near the shrine of Abdul Qadir al-Gillani.

== In pop culture ==
Al-Gillani and his role in the Ottoman Empire was briefly mentioned in the Iraqi television drama Sarah Khatoon, which aired on Al Sharqiya.

<doc id="215403" wikidata="Q11022655" url="?curid=215403" title="Case law">
<text>Case law, also used interchangeably with common law, is a law that is based on precedents, that is the judicial decisions from previous cases, rather than law based on constitutions, statutes, or regulations. Case law uses the detailed facts of a legal case that have been resolved by courts or similar tribunals. These past decisions are called &quot;case law&quot;, or precedent. &quot;Stare decisis&quot;—a Latin phrase meaning &quot;let the decision stand&quot;—is the principle by which judges are bound to such past decisions, drawing on established judicial authority to formulate their positions. 

These judicial interpretations are distinguished from statutory law, which are codes enacted by legislative bodies, and regulatory law, which are established by executive agencies based on statutes. In some jurisdictions, case law can be applied to ongoing adjudication; for example, criminal proceedings or family law.

In common law countries (including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Ireland, India, Pakistan, Bangladeshi, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Israel and Hong Kong), it is used for judicial decisions of selected appellate courts, courts of first instance, agency tribunals, and other bodies discharging adjudicatory functions.

== In common law systems ==

In the common law tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedents which record how and why prior cases have been decided. Unlike most civil law systems, common law systems follow the doctrine of stare decisis, by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases. According to stare decisis, all lower courts should make decisions consistent with the previous decisions of higher courts. For example, in England, the High Court and the Court of Appeals are each bound by their own previous decisions, however, since the Practice Statement 1966 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom can deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does. A notable example of when the court has overturned its precedent is the case of &quot;R v Jogee&quot;, where the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that it and the other courts of England and Wales had misapplied the law for nearly 30 years.

Generally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over the lower courts of record, in that they cannot reach out on their initiative (&quot;sua sponte&quot;) at any time to overrule judgments of the lower courts. Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent, and the case is not appealed, the decision will stand.

A lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if it feels that it is unjust; it may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that it should be &quot;distinguished&quot; by some material difference between the facts of the cases; some jurisdictions allow for a judge to recommend that an appeal be carried out. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. Lord Denning, first of the High Court of Justice, later of the Court of Appeal, provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of estoppel starting in the &quot;High Trees&quot; case.

== How case law is made ==
The different roles of case law in civil and common law traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often interpret the wider legal principles. The necessary analysis (called &quot;ratio decidendi&quot;), then constitutes a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, which constitute persuasive authority but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally shorter, referring only to statutes.

The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions adhere to a tradition that the reader should be able to deduce the logic from the decision and the statutes.

Some pluralist systems, such as Scots law in Scotland and types of civil law jurisdictions in Quebec and Louisiana, do not precisely fit into the dual common-civil law system classifications. These types of systems may have been heavily influenced by the Anglo-American common law tradition; however, their substantive law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as mixed systems of law.

Law professors traditionally have played a much smaller role in developing case law in common law than professors in civil law. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are historically brief and not formally amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as &quot;Recueil Dalloz&quot; in France. Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as Coke and Blackstone). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as persuasive authority; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic&#x27;s restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in case law. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long-held in civil law jurisdictions.

Judges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to decide a case. Widely cited non-binding sources include legal encyclopedias such as &quot;Corpus Juris Secundum&quot; and &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England&quot;, or the published work of the Law Commission or the American Law Institute. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the Highway Code.

In federal or multi-jurisdictional law systems there may exist conflicts between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved, and it may be necessary to distinguish how the law is applied in one district, province, division or appellate department. Usually, only an appeal accepted by the court of last resort will resolve such differences and, for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.

Any court may seek to distinguish the present case from that of a binding precedent, to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal of that judgment to a higher court. An appellate court may also decide on an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case, may distinguish them on the facts.

Where there are several members of a court deciding a case, there may be one or more judgments given (or reported). Only the reason for the decision of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in an argument. Apart from the rules of procedure for precedent, the weight given to any reported judgment may depend on the reputation of both the reporter and the judges.

==Nordic nations==
The legal systems of the Nordic countries are sometimes included among the civil law systems, but as a separate branch, and sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In Sweden, for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the Continental codified law systems. The two highest courts, the Supreme Court (&quot;Högsta domstolen&quot;) and the Supreme Administrative Court (&quot;Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen&quot;), have the right to set precedent which is in practice (however not formally) binding on all future application of the law. Courts of appeal, both general courts (&quot;hovrätter&quot;) and administrative courts (&quot;kammarrätter&quot;), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions may be overturned by higher courts. Thus &quot;case law&quot; is used to determine the actual applicability and limits of a law and not, as in common law jurisdictions, the creation of law.

<text>Trespass is an area of tort law broadly divided into three groups: trespass to the person (see below), trespass to chattels, and trespass to land.

Trespass to the person historically involved six separate trespasses: threats, assault, battery, wounding, mayhem (or maiming), and false imprisonment. Through the evolution of the common law in various jurisdictions, and the codification of common law torts, most jurisdictions now broadly recognize three trespasses to the person: assault, which is &quot;any act of such a nature as to excite an apprehension of battery&quot;; battery, &quot;any intentional and unpermitted contact with the plaintiff&#x27;s person or anything attached to it and practically identified with it&quot;; and false imprisonment, the &quot; or of freedom from restraint of movement&quot;.

Trespass to chattel does not require a showing of damages. Simply the &quot;intermeddling with or use of … the personal property&quot; of another gives cause of action for trespass. Since &quot;CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.&quot;, various courts have applied the principles of trespass to chattel to resolve cases involving unsolicited bulk e-mail and unauthorized server usage.

Trespass to land is today the tort most commonly associated with the term &quot;trespass&quot;; it takes the form of &quot;wrongful interference with one&#x27;s possessory rights in [real] property&quot;. Generally, it is not necessary to prove harm to a possessor&#x27;s legally protected interest; liability for unintentional trespass varies by jurisdiction. &quot; common law, every unauthorized entry upon the soil of another was a trespasser&quot;; however, under the tort scheme established by the Restatement of Torts, liability for unintentional intrusions arises only under circumstances evincing negligence or where the intrusion involved a highly dangerous activity.

Trespass has also been treated as a common law offense in some countries.

==Trespass to the person==
There are three types of trespass, the first of which is trespass to the person. Whether intent is a necessary element of trespass to the person varies by jurisdiction. Under English decision, &quot;Letang v Cooper&quot;, intent is required to sustain a trespass to the person cause of action; in the absence of intent, negligence is the appropriate tort. In other jurisdictions, gross negligence is sufficient to sustain a trespass to the person, such as when a defendant negligently operates an automobile and strikes the plaintiff with great force. &quot;Intent is to be presumed from the act itself.&quot; Generally, and as defined by Goff LJ in &quot;Collins v Wilcock&quot;, trespass to the person consists of three torts: assault, battery, and false imprisonment.

===Assault===
In various common law jurisdictions, assault is both a crime and a tort. Generally, a person commits criminal assault if they purposely, knowingly, or recklessly inflict bodily injury upon another; if they negligently inflict bodily injury upon another by means of dangerous weapon; or if through physical menace, they place another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury. A person commits tortious assault when they engage in &quot;any act of such a nature as to excite an apprehension of battery [bodily injury]&quot;. In some jurisdictions, there is no requirement that actual physical violence result—simply the &quot;threat of unwanted touching of the victim&quot; suffices to sustain an assault claim. Consequently, in &quot;R v Constanza&quot;, the court found a stalker&#x27;s threats could constitute assault. Similarly, silence, given certain conditions, may constitute an assault as well. However, in other jurisdictions, simple threats are insufficient; they must be accompanied by an action or condition to trigger a cause of action.

Incongruity of a defendant&#x27;s language and action, or of a plaintiff&#x27;s perception and reality may vitiate an assault claim. In &quot;Tuberville v Savage&quot;, the defendant reached for his sword and told the plaintiff that &quot; it were not assize-time, I would not take such language from you&quot;. In its American counterpart, &quot;Commonwealth v. Eyre&quot;, the defendant shouted &quot; it were not for your gray hairs, I would tear your heart out&quot;. In both cases, the courts held that despite a threatening gesture, the plaintiffs were not in immediate danger. The actions must give the plaintiff a reasonable expectation that the defendant is going to use violence; a fist raised before the plaintiff may suffice; the same fist raised behind the window of a police cruiser will not.

===Battery===
Battery is &quot;any intentional and unpermitted contact with the plaintiff&#x27;s person or anything attached to it and practically identified with it&quot;. The elements of battery common law varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, the American Law Institute&#x27;s Restatement of Torts provides a general rule to determine liability for battery:

Battery torts under Commonwealth precedent are subjected to a four point test to determine liability:

# &quot;Directness&quot;. Is the sequence of events connecting initial conduct and the harmful contact an unbroken series?
# &quot;Intentional act&quot;. Was the harmful contact the conscious object of the defendant? Did the defendant intend to cause the resulting harm? Though the necessity of intent remains an integral part of Commonwealth battery, some Commonwealth jurisdictions have moved toward the American jurisprudence of &quot;substantial certainty&quot;. If a reasonable person in the defendant&#x27;s position would apprehend the substantial certainty of the consequences of his actions, whether the defendant intended to inflict the injuries is immaterial.
# &quot;Bodily contact&quot;. Was there active (as opposed to passive) contact between the bodies of the plaintiff and the defendant?
# &quot;Consent&quot;. Did the plaintiff consent to the harmful contact? The onus is on the defendant to establish sufficient and effective consent.

===False imprisonment===
False imprisonment is defined as &quot; or of freedom from restraint of movement&quot;. In some jurisdictions, false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability: no intention on the behalf of the defendant is needed, but others require an intent to cause the confinement. Physical force, however, is not a necessary element, and confinement need not be lengthy;
the restraint must be complete, though the defendant needn&#x27;t resist.

Conveniently, the American Law Institute&#x27;s Restatement (Second) of Torts distills false imprisonment liability analysis into a four-prong test:

# The defendant intends to confine the plaintiff. (This is not necessary in Commonwealth jurisdictions.)
# The plaintiff is conscious of the confinement. (Prosser rejects this requirement.)
# The plaintiff does not consent to the confinement.
# The confinement was not otherwise privileged.

===Defenses===

====Child correction====
Depending on the jurisdiction, corporal punishment of children by parents or instructors may be a defense to trespass to the person, so long as the punishment was &quot;reasonably necessary under the circumstances to discipline a child who has misbehaved&quot; and the defendant &quot; prudence and restraint&quot;. Unreasonable punishments, such as violently grabbing a student&#x27;s arm and hair, have no defense. Many jurisdictions, however, limit corporal punishment to parents, and a few, such as New Zealand, have criminalized the practice.

====Consent====
Perhaps the most common defense for the torts of trespass to the person is that of , literally, &quot;to a willing person, no injury is done&quot;, but shortened to &quot;consensual privilege&quot; or &quot;consent&quot;. If a plaintiff participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This is not the case if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, such as the use of hand gun during a fistfight, as in &quot;Andrepont v Naquin&quot;, or where the injuries were suffered not from the plaintiff&#x27;s participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in &quot;Watson v British Boxing Board of Control Ltd&quot;. Where the plaintiff and defendant voluntarily agree to participate in a fight, some jurisdictions will deny relief in civil action, so long as the injuries caused are proportionate: &quot;in an ordinary fight with fists there is no cause of action to either of [the combatants] for any injury suffered&quot;. Other jurisdictions refuse to recognize consent as a defense to mutual combat and instead provide relief under the doctrine of comparative negligence.

Medical care gives rise to many claims of trespass to the person. A physician, &quot;treating a mentally competent adult under non-emergency circumstances, cannot properly undertake to perform surgery or administer other therapy without the prior consent of his patient&quot;. Should he do so, he commits a trespass to the person and is liable for damages. However, if the plaintiff is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure, there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused; the plaintiff&#x27;s agreement constitutes informed consent. In those cases where the patient does not possess sufficient mental capacity to consent, doctors must exercise extreme caution. In &quot;F v West Berkshire Health Authority&quot;, the House of Lords instructed British physicians that, to justify operating upon such an individual, there &quot;(1) must ... be a necessity to act when it is not practicable to communicate with the assisted person ... [and] (2) the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take, acting in the best interests of the assisted person&quot;.

====Self-defense / defense of others / defense of property====
Self-defense, or non-consensual privilege, is a valid defense to trespasses against the person, assuming that it constituted the use of &quot;reasonable force which they honestly and reasonably believe is necessary to protect themselves or someone else, or property&quot;. The force used must be proportionate to the threat, as ruled in &quot;Cockcroft v Smith&quot;.

==Trespass to chattels==
Trespass to chattels (also known as trespass to goods or trespass to personal property) is defined as &quot;an intentional interference with the possession of personal property...proximately injury&quot;. While originally a remedy for the asportation of personal property, the tort grew to incorporate any interference with the personal property of another. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, trespass to chattels has been codified to clearly define the scope of the remedy; in most jurisdictions, trespass to chattel remains a purely common law remedy, the scope of which varies by jurisdiction.

Generally, trespass to chattels possesses three elements:

# &quot;Lack of consent&quot;. The interference with the property must be non-consensual. A claim does not lie if, in acquiring the property, the purchaser consents contractually to certain access by the seller. &quot; use exceeding the consent&quot; authorized by the contract, should it cause harm, gives rise to a cause for action.
# &quot;Actual harm&quot;. The interference with the property must result in actual harm. The threshold for actual harm varies by jurisdiction. In California, for instance, an electronic message may constitute a trespass if the message interferes with the functioning of the computer hardware, but the plaintiff must prove that this interference caused actual hardware damage or actual impaired functioning.
# &quot;Intentionality&quot;. The interference must be intentional. What constitutes intention varies by jurisdiction, however, the Restatement (Second) of Torts indicates that &quot;intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise intermeddling with a chattel or with knowledge that such an intermeddling will, to a substantial certainty, result from the act&quot;, and continues: &quot; is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such intermeddling is a violation of the possessory rights of another&quot;.

Remedies for trespass to chattel include damages, liability for conversion, and injunction, depending on the nature of the interference.

===Traditional applications===
Trespass to chattels typically applies to tangible property and allows the owner of such property to seek relief when a third party intentionally interferes or intermeddles in the owner&#x27;s possession of his personal property. &quot;Interference&quot; is often interpreted as the &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;destroying&quot; of goods, but can be as minor as &quot;touching&quot; or &quot;moving&quot; them in the right circumstances. In &quot;Kirk v Gregory&quot;, the defendant moved jewelry from one room to another, where it was stolen. The deceased owner&#x27;s executor successfully sued her for trespass to chattel. Furthermore, personal property, as traditionally construed, includes living objects, except where property interests are restricted by law. Thus animals are personal property, but organs are not.

===Modern US applications===

In recent years, trespass to chattels has been expanded in the United States to cover intangible property, including combating the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email as well as virtual property interests in online worlds. In the late 1990s, American courts enlarged trespass to chattels, first to include the unauthorized use of long distance telephone lines, and later to include unsolicited bulk email. In 1998, a federal court in Virginia held that the owner of a marketing company committed trespass to chattels against an Internet service provider&#x27;s computer network by sending 60 million unauthorized email advertisements after being notified that the spam was unauthorized. In &quot;America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.&quot;, AOL successfully sued a pornographic website for spamming AOL customers and forging the AOL domain name to trick customers. By the new millennium, trespass to chattel expanded beyond bulk email. In &quot;eBay v. Bidder&#x27;s Edge&quot;, a California court ruled that Bidder&#x27;s Edge&#x27;s use of a web crawler to cull auction information from eBay&#x27;s website constituted trespass to chattel and further, that a plaintiff in such a suit need not prove that the interference was substantial. A number of similar cases followed until, in &quot;Intel v. Hamidi&quot;, the Supreme Court of California held that a plaintiff must demonstrate either actual interference with the physical functionality of the computer system or the likelihood that such interference would occur in the future. The &quot;Hamidi&quot; decision quickly found acceptance at both the federal and state level.

To date, no United States court has identified property rights in items acquired in virtual worlds; heretofore, virtual world providers have relied on end-user license agreements to govern user behavior. Nevertheless, as virtual worlds grow, incidents of property interference, a form of &quot;griefing&quot;, may make trespass to chattel an attractive remedy for deleted, stolen, or corrupted virtual property.

==Trespass to land==

Trespass to land involves the &quot;wrongful interference with one&#x27;s possessory rights in [real] property&quot;. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable &quot;per se&quot;. While most trespasses to land are intentional, British courts have held liability holds for trespass committed negligently. Similarly, some American courts will find liability for unintentional intrusions only where such intrusions arise under circumstances evincing negligence or involve a highly dangerous activity. Exceptions exist for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident), as in &quot;River Wear Commissioners v Adamson&quot;. In some jurisdictions, trespass while in possession of a firearm, which may include a low-power air weapon without ammunition, constitutes a more grave crime of armed trespass.

===Subsoil and airspace===
Aside from the surface, land includes the subsoil, airspace and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses, and other infrastructure, this is literally explained by the legal maxim quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit.

====Subsoil====
William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; articulated the common law principle , translating from Latin as &quot;for whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell&quot;. In modern times, courts have limited the right of absolute dominion over the subsurface. For instance, drilling a directional well that bottoms out beneath another&#x27;s property to access oil and gas reserves is trespass, but a subsurface invasion by hydraulic fracturing is not. Where mineral rights are severed from surface ownership, it is trespass to use another&#x27;s surface to assist in mining the minerals beneath that individual&#x27;s property, but, where an emergency responder accesses the subsurface following a blowout and fire, no trespass lies. Even the possible subsurface migration of toxic waste stored underground is not trespass, except where the plaintiff can demonstrate that the actions &quot;actually interfere with the [owner&#x27;s] reasonable and foreseeable use of the subsurface&quot;, or, in some jurisdictions, that the subsurface trespasser knows with &quot;substantial certainty&quot; that the toxic liquids will migrate to the neighboring land.

====Airspace====

Domain of landowners over their airspace is limited to the lower atmosphere.

In the United States, &quot;United States v. Causby&quot; (1946) limited landowner domain to the space below , Justice William O. Douglas reasoned that, should it find in the landowners&#x27; favor and accept the &quot;ancient doctrine that at common law ownership of land to the periphery of the universe—&quot;, &quot;every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits&quot;. Citizens have a right to fly in the &quot;navigable airspace&quot;. 

Thirty-one years later, in &quot;Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews &amp; General Ltd&quot;, an English court reached a similar conclusion, finding an action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred meters above the land: &quot;If the Latin maxim were applied literally it would lead to the absurdity of trespass being committed every time a satellite passed over a suburban garden.&quot;

===Interference===
The main element of the tort is &quot;interference&quot;. This must be both direct and physical, with indirect interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance. &quot;Interference&quot; covers any physical entry to land, as well as the abuse of a right of entry, when a person who has the right to enter the land does something not covered by the permission. If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires, this is also trespass. It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land. For the purposes of trespass, the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner; it is not, however, a trespass to use that road if the road is constructed with a public use easement, or if, by owner acquiescence or through adverse possession, the road has undergone a common law dedication to the public. In &quot;Hickman v Maisey&quot; and &quot;Adams v. Rivers&quot;, the courts established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass: &quot; a land owner&#x27;s property rights may be to the right of mere passage, the owner of the soil is still absolute master.&quot;
British courts have broadened the rights encompassed by public easements in recent years. In &quot;DPP v Jones&quot;, the court ruled that &quot;the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway.&quot; The principles established in &quot;Adams&quot; remain valid in American law.

===Defenses===
There are several defenses to trespass to land; license, justification by law, necessity and . License is express or implied permission, given by the possessor of land, to be on that land. These licenses are generally revocable unless there is contractual agreement preventing them being revoked. Once revoked, a license-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the England and Wales&#x27; Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest, or the California state constitution, which permits protests on grocery stores and strip malls, despite their presenting a general nuisance to store owners and patrons. is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the plaintiff, but by a third party, as in &quot;Doe d Carter v Barnard&quot;. This defense is unavailable if the plaintiff is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the plaintiff his lease (e.g., an illegal apartment rental, an unauthorized sublet, etc.). Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in &quot;Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation&quot;, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defense of necessity was accepted. Necessity does not, however, permit a defendant to enter another&#x27;s property when alternative, though less attractive, courses of action exist.

<text>Karin Kiefer Smith (born August 4, 1955, in Fürstenfeldbruck, Bavaria) is a retired female javelin thrower from the United States. She was born in Germany. She is a three-time Olympian. Smith qualified for a fourth, the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. She did, however, receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

Her all-time career-best mark was 212 feet, 6 inches in August 1980.

==Early life and college success==
After graduating from La Jolla High School, Smith initially attended UCLA before leaving to train in Germany in 1977.

Smith then returned to college, enrolling at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. While at Cal Poly, she won the Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation&#x27;s best female collegiate track and field competitor in 1982.

With Smith leading the way, the Mustangs won the 1981 AIAW Division II national championship and then repeated at the first NCAA D-II national finals meet in 1982. During an era when Division II winners could then also compete at the Division I meets, Smith won the NCAA Division I javelin individual national championship on June 4, 1982 with a mark of 206 feet, 9 inches, which held the all-time event record with the previous design.

<text>The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is a species of deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. It can grow to a tremendous size, offering an example of abyssal gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum size at around for females and for males, from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles. This makes it longer than the colossal squid at an estimated , but substantially lighter, as the tentacles make up most of the length. The mantle of the giant squid is about long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles (but including head and arms) rarely exceeds . Claims of specimens measuring or more have not been scientifically documented.

The number of different giant squid species has been debated, but genetic research suggests that only one species exists.

In 2004, a Japanese research team obtained the first images of a living animal in its habitat.

== Taxonomy ==
The closest relatives of the giant squid are thought to be the four obscure species of &quot;neosquid&quot; in the family Neoteuthidae, each of which belongs to its own monotypic genus, as with the giant squid. Together, both families comprise the superfamily Architeuthoidea.

== Range and habitat ==
The giant squid is widespread, occurring in all of the world&#x27;s oceans. It is usually found near continental and island slopes from the North Atlantic Ocean, especially Newfoundland, Norway, the northern British Isles, Spain and the oceanic islands of the Azores and Madeira, to the South Atlantic around southern Africa, the North Pacific around Japan, and the southwestern Pacific around New Zealand and Australia. Specimens are rare in tropical and polar latitudes.

The vertical distribution of giant squid is incompletely known, but data from trawled specimens and sperm whale diving behavior suggest it spans a large range of depths, possibly .

== Morphology and anatomy ==

Like all squid, a giant squid has a mantle (torso), eight arms, and two longer tentacles (the longest known tentacles of any cephalopod). The arms and tentacles account for much of the squid&#x27;s great length, making it much lighter than its chief predator, the sperm whale. Scientifically documented specimens have masses of hundreds, rather than thousands, of kilograms.
The inside surfaces of the arms and tentacles are lined with hundreds of subspherical suction cups, in diameter, each mounted on a stalk. The circumference of these suckers is lined with sharp, finely serrated rings of chitin. The perforation of these teeth and the suction of the cups serve to attach the squid to its prey. It is common to find circular scars from the suckers on or close to the head of sperm whales that have attacked giant squid.

Each tentacular club is divided into three regions—the carpus (&quot;wrist&quot;), manus (&quot;hand&quot;) and dactylus (&quot;finger&quot;). The carpus has a dense cluster of cups, in six or seven irregular, transverse rows. The manus is broader, closer to the end of the club, and has enlarged suckers in two medial rows. The dactylus is the tip. The bases of all the arms and tentacles are arranged in a circle surrounding the animal&#x27;s single, parrot-like beak, as in other cephalopods.
Giant squid have small fins at the rear of their mantles used for locomotion. Like other cephalopods, they are propelled by jet—by pulling water into the mantle cavity, and pushing it through the siphon, in gentle, rhythmic pulses. They can also move quickly by expanding the cavity to fill it with water, then contracting muscles to jet water through the siphon. Giant squid breathe using two large gills inside the mantle cavity. The circulatory system is closed, which is a distinct characteristic of cephalopods. Like other squid, they contain dark ink.

The giant squid has a sophisticated nervous system and complex brain, attracting great interest from scientists. It also has the largest eyes of any living creature except perhaps the colossal squid—up to at least in diameter, with a pupil (only the extinct ichthyosaurs are known to have had larger eyes). Large eyes can better detect light (including bioluminescent light), which is scarce in deep water. The giant squid probably cannot see color, but it can probably discern small differences in tone, which is important in the low-light conditions of the deep ocean.

Giant squid and some other large squid species maintain neutral buoyancy in seawater through an ammonium chloride solution which is found throughout their bodies and is lighter than seawater. This differs from the method of flotation used by most fish, which involves a gas-filled swim bladder. The solution tastes somewhat like salty liquorice/salmiak and makes giant squid unattractive for general human consumption.

Like all cephalopods, giant squid use organs called statocysts to sense their orientation and motion in water. The age of a giant squid can be determined by &quot;growth rings&quot; in the statocyst&#x27;s statolith, similar to determining the age of a tree by counting its rings. Much of what is known about giant squid age is based on estimates of the growth rings and from undigested beaks found in the stomachs of sperm whales.

== Size ==

The giant squid is the second-largest mollusc and one of the largest of all extant invertebrates. It is exceeded only by the colossal squid, &quot;Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni&quot;, which may have a mantle nearly twice as long. Several extinct cephalopods, such as the Cretaceous coleoids &quot;Yezoteuthis&quot; and &quot;Haboroteuthis&quot;, and the Ordovician nautiloid &quot;Endoceras&quot; may have grown even larger. Although the Cretaceous &quot;Tusoteuthis,&quot; with its long mantle, was once considered to grow to a size close to that of the giant squid (over including arms), this genus is likely doubtful. The largest specimen probably belonged to the genus &quot;Enchoteuthis,&quot; estimated to have short arms, with a total length of only .

Giant squid size, particularly total length, has often been exaggerated. Reports of specimens reaching and even exceeding are widespread, but no specimens approaching this size have been scientifically documented. According to giant squid expert Steve O&#x27;Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.

Based on the examination of 130 specimens and of beaks found inside sperm whales, giant squids&#x27; mantles are not known to exceed . Including the head and arms, but excluding the tentacles, the length very rarely exceeds . Maximum total length, when measured relaxed &quot;post mortem&quot;, is estimated at or for females and for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles.

Giant squid exhibit sexual dimorphism. Maximum weight is estimated at for females and for males.

== Reproductive cycle ==
Little is known about the reproductive cycle of giant squid. They are thought to reach sexual maturity at about three years old; males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than females. Females produce large quantities of eggs, sometimes more than , that average long and wide. Females have a single median ovary in the rear end of the mantle cavity and paired, convoluted oviducts, where mature eggs pass exiting through the oviducal glands, then through the nidamental glands. As in other squid, these glands produce a gelatinous material used to keep the eggs together once they are laid.

In males, as with most other cephalopods, the single, posterior testis produces sperm that move into a complex system of glands that manufacture the spermatophores. These are stored in the elongate sac, or Needham&#x27;s sac, that terminates in the penis from which they are expelled during mating. The penis is prehensile, over long, and extends from inside the mantle. The two ventral arms on a male giant squid are hectocotylized, which means they are specialized to facilitate the fertilization of the female&#x27;s eggs.

How the sperm is transferred to the egg mass is much debated, as giant squid lack the hectocotylus used for reproduction in many other cephalopods. It may be transferred in sacs of spermatophores, called spermatangia, which the male injects into the female&#x27;s arms. This is suggested by a female specimen recently found in Tasmania, having a small subsidiary tendril attached to the base of each arm.

Post-larval juveniles have been discovered in surface waters off New Zealand, with plans to capture more and maintain them in an aquarium. Young giant squid specimens were found off the coast of southern Japan in 2013 and confirmed through genetic analysis.

Another juvenile, approximately 3.7 metres long, was encountered and filmed alive in the harbour in the Japanese city of Toyama on 24 December 2015; after being filmed and viewed by a large number of spectators, including a diver who entered the water to film the squid up close, it was guided out of the harbour into Toyama Bay by the diver.

==Genetics==
Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of giant squid individuals from all over the world has found that there is little variation between individuals across the globe (just 181 differing genetic base pairs out of 20,331). This suggests that there is only a single species of giant squid in the world. Squid larvae may be dispersed by ocean currents across vast distances.

== Ecology ==
=== Feeding ===
Recent studies have shown giant squid feed on deep-sea fish, such as the orange roughy (&quot;Hoplostethus atlanticus&quot;), and other squid species. They catch prey using the two tentacles, gripping it with serrated sucker rings on the ends. Then they bring it toward the powerful beak, and shred it with the radula (tongue with small, file-like teeth) before it reaches the esophagus. They are believed to be solitary hunters, as only individual giant squid have been caught in fishing nets. Although the majority of giant squid caught by trawl in New Zealand waters have been associated with the local hoki (&quot;Macruronus novaezelandiae&quot;) fishery, hoki do not feature in the squid&#x27;s diet. This suggests giant squid and hoki prey on the same animals.

=== Predators and potential cannibalism ===
The known predators of adult giant squid include sperm whales, pilot whales, southern sleeper sharks, and in some regions killer whales. Juveniles may fall prey to other large deep sea predators. Because sperm whales are skilled at locating giant squid, scientists have tried to observe them to study the squid. Giant squid have also been recently discovered to presumably steal food from each other; in mid-to-late October 2016, a giant squid washed ashore in Galicia, Spain. The squid had been photographed alive by a tourist named Javier Ondicol shortly before its death, and examination of its corpse by the Coordinators for the Study and Protection of Marine Species (CEPESMA) indicates that the squid was attacked and mortally wounded by another giant squid, losing parts of its fins, and receiving damage to its mantle, one of its gills, and losing an eye. The intact nature of the specimen indicates that the giant squid managed to escape its rival by slowly retreating to shallow water, where it died of its wounds. The incident is the second to be documented among &quot;Architeuthis&quot; recorded in Spain, with the other occurring in Villaviciosa. Evidence in the form of giant squid stomach contents containing beak fragments from other giant squid in Tasmania also supports the theory that the species is at least occasionally cannibalistic. Alternatively, such squid-on-squid attacks may be a result of competition for prey. These traits are seen in the Humboldt squid as well, indicating that cannibalism in large squid may be more common than originally thought.

== Population ==
Scientists have been unable to determine the worldwide population of giant squid to any degree of accuracy. Estimates have been put together based on the number of giant squid beaks found in the stomachs of deceased sperm whales, a known predator of the giant squid, and the better-known population of sperm whales. Based on such observations, it has been estimated that sperm whales consume between 4.3 and 131 million giant squid annually, implying that the giant squid population is likewise well into the millions, but more precise estimates have been elusive.

== Species ==

The taxonomy of the giant squid, as with many cephalopod genera, has long been debated. Lumpers and splitters may propose as many as seventeen species or as few as one. The broadest list is:
* &quot;Architeuthis dux&quot;, Atlantic giant squid
* &quot;Architeuthis (Loligo) hartingii&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis japonica&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis kirkii&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis (Megateuthis) martensii&quot;, North Pacific giant squid
* &quot;Architeuthis physeteris&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis sanctipauli&quot;, southern giant squid
* &quot;Architeuthis (Steenstrupia) stockii&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis (Loligo) bouyeri&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis clarkei&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis (Plectoteuthis) grandis&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis (Megaloteuthis) harveyi&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis longimanus&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis monachus?&quot; 
* &quot;Architeuthis nawaji&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis princeps&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis (Dubioteuthis) physeteris&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis titan&quot;
* &quot;Architeuthis verrilli&quot;
It is unclear if these are distinct species, as no genetic or physical basis for distinguishing between them has yet been proposed.

In the 1984 &quot;FAO Species Catalogue of the Cephalopods of the World&quot;, Roper, &quot;et al.&quot; wrote:

In &quot;Cephalopods: A World Guide&quot; (2000), Mark Norman writes:

In March 2013, researchers at the University of Copenhagen suggested that, based on DNA research, there is only one species:

== Timeline ==


Aristotle, who lived in the fourth century BC, described a large squid, which he called &quot;teuthus&quot;, distinguishing it from the smaller squid, the &quot;teuthis&quot;. He mentions, &quot;of the calamaries, the so-called &quot;teuthus&quot; is much bigger than the &quot;teuthis&quot;; for &quot;teuthi&quot; [plural of &quot;teuthus&quot;] have been found as much as five ells [5.7 metres] long&quot;.

Pliny the Elder, living in the first century AD, also described a gigantic squid in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, with the head &quot;as big as a cask&quot;, arms long, and carcass weighing .

Tales of giant squid have been common among mariners since ancient times, and may have led to the Norse legend of the &quot;kraken&quot;, a tentacled sea monster as large as an island capable of engulfing and sinking any ship. Japetus Steenstrup, the describer of &quot;Architeuthis&quot;, suggested a giant squid was the species described as a sea monk to the Danish king Christian III &quot;circa&quot; 1550. The Lusca of the Caribbean and Scylla in Greek mythology may also derive from giant squid sightings. Eyewitness accounts of other sea monsters like the sea serpent are also thought to be mistaken interpretations of giant squid. Nevertheless, the historian Otto Latva, who has studied the past interactions between humans and giant squid, has pointed out that many old stories about sea monsters were not associated with giant squid until the late 19th century. Latva has proposed that the giant squid was &quot;monsterized&quot; in the 19th century by natural historians and other writers. Regarding seafarers&#x27; relationship with giant squid, he explains it as being pragmatic: they did not perceive giant squid as monsters, but as sea animals that could be utilized in various ways.

Steenstrup wrote a number of papers on giant squid in the 1850s. He first used the term &quot;Architeuthus&quot; (this was the spelling he chose) in a paper in 1857. A portion of a giant squid was secured by the French corvette &quot;Alecton&quot; in 1861, leading to wider recognition of the genus in the scientific community. From 1870 to 1880, many squid were stranded on the shores of Newfoundland. For example, a specimen washed ashore in Thimble Tickle Bay, Newfoundland, on 2 November 1878; its mantle was reported to be long, with one tentacle long, and it was estimated as weighing . Many of these specimens were not preserved, often being processed into manure or animal feed. In 1873, a squid &quot;attacked&quot; a minister and a young boy in a dory near Bell Island, Newfoundland. Many strandings also occurred in New Zealand during the late 19th century.
Although strandings continue to occur sporadically throughout the world, none have been as frequent as those at Newfoundland and New Zealand in the 19th century. It is not known why giant squid become stranded on shore, but it may be because the distribution of deep, cold water where squid live is temporarily altered. Many scientists who have studied squid mass strandings believe they are cyclical and predictable. The length of time between strandings is not known, but was proposed to be 90 years by &quot;Architeuthis&quot; specialist Frederick Aldrich. Aldrich used this value to correctly predict a relatively small stranding that occurred between 1961 and 1968.

In 2004, another giant squid, later named &quot;Archie&quot;, was caught off the coast of the Falkland Islands by a fishing trawler. It was long and was sent to the Natural History Museum in London to be studied and preserved. It was put on display on 1 March 2006 at the Darwin Centre. The find of such a large, complete specimen is very rare, as most specimens are in a poor condition, having washed up dead on beaches or been retrieved from the stomachs of dead sperm whales.

Researchers undertook a painstaking process to preserve the body. It was transported to England on ice aboard the trawler; then it was defrosted, which took about four days. The major difficulty was that thawing the thick mantle took much longer than the tentacles. To prevent the tentacles from rotting, scientists covered them in ice packs, and bathed the mantle in water. Then they injected the squid with a formol-saline solution to prevent rotting. It is now on show in a glass tank at the Darwin Centre of the Natural History Museum.


In December 2005, the Melbourne Aquarium in Australia paid A$100,000 for the intact body of a giant squid, preserved in a giant block of ice, which had been caught by fishermen off the coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island that year.

The number of known giant squid specimens was close to 700 in 2011, and new ones are reported each year. Around 30 of these specimens are exhibited at museums and aquaria worldwide. The Museo del Calamar Gigante in Luarca, Spain, had by far the largest collection on public display, but many of the museum&#x27;s specimens were destroyed during a storm in February 2014.

The search for a live &quot;Architeuthis&quot; specimen includes attempts to find live young, including larvae. The larvae closely resemble those of &quot;Nototodarus&quot; and &quot;Onykia&quot;, but are distinguished by the shape of the mantle attachment to the head, the tentacle suckers, and the beaks.

=== Images and video of live animals ===

By the turn of the 21st century, the giant squid remained one of the few extant megafauna to have never been photographed alive, either in the wild or in captivity. Marine biologist and author Richard Ellis described it as &quot;the most elusive image in natural history&quot;. In 1993, an image purporting to show a diver with a live giant squid (identified as &quot;Architeuthis dux&quot;) was published in the book &quot;European Seashells&quot;. However, the animal in this photograph was a sick or dying &quot;Onykia robusta&quot;, not a giant squid. The first footage of live (larval) giant squid ever captured on film was in 2001. The footage was shown on &quot;Chasing Giants: On the Trail of the Giant Squid&quot; on the Discovery Channel.

==== First images of live adult ====

The first image of a live mature giant squid was taken on 15 January 2002, on Goshiki beach, Amino Cho, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. The animal, which measured about in mantle length and in total length, was found near the water&#x27;s surface. It was captured and tied to a quay, where it died overnight. The specimen was identified by Koutarou Tsuchiya of the Tokyo University of Fisheries. It is on display at the National Science Museum of Japan.

==== First observations in the wild ====
The first photographs of a live giant squid in its natural habitat were taken on 30 September 2004, by Tsunemi Kubodera (National Science Museum of Japan) and Kyoichi Mori (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association). Their teams had worked together for nearly two years to accomplish this. They used a five-ton fishing boat and only two crew members. The images were created on their third trip to a known sperm whale hunting ground south of Tokyo, where they had dropped a line baited with squid and shrimp. The line also held a camera and a flash. After over twenty tries that day, an giant squid attacked the lure and snagged its tentacle. The camera took over 500 photos before the squid managed to break free after four hours. The squid&#x27;s tentacle remained attached to the lure. Later DNA tests confirmed the animal as a giant squid.

On 27 September 2005, Kubodera and Mori released the photographs to the world. The photo sequence, taken at a depth of off Japan&#x27;s Ogasawara Islands, shows the squid homing in on the baited line and enveloping it in &quot;a ball of tentacles&quot;. The researchers were able to locate the likely general location of giant squid by closely tailing the movements of sperm whales. According to Kubodera, &quot;we knew that they fed on the squid, and we knew when and how deep they dived, so we used them to lead us to the squid&quot;. Kubodera and Mori reported their observations in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;.

Among other things, the observations demonstrate actual hunting behaviors of adult &quot;Architeuthis&quot;, a subject on which there had been much speculation. The photographs showed an aggressive hunting pattern by the baited squid, leading to it impaling a tentacle on the bait ball&#x27;s hooks. This may disprove the theory that the giant squid is a drifter which eats whatever floats by, rarely moving so as to conserve energy. It seems the species has a much more aggressive feeding technique.

===== First video of live adult in natural habitat =====
In November 2006, American explorer and diver Scott Cassell led an expedition to the Gulf of California with the aim of filming a giant squid in its natural habitat. The team employed a novel filming method: using a Humboldt squid carrying a specially designed camera clipped to its fin. The camera-bearing squid caught on film what was claimed to be a giant squid, with an estimated length of , engaging in predatory behavior. The footage aired a year later on a History Channel program, &quot;MonsterQuest: Giant Squid Found&quot;. Cassell subsequently distanced himself from this documentary, claiming that it contained multiple factual and scientific errors.

In July 2012, a crew from television networks NHK and Discovery Channel captured what was described as &quot;the first-ever footage of a live giant squid in its natural habitat&quot;. The footage was revealed on a NHK Special on 13 January 2013, and was shown on Discovery Channel&#x27;s show &quot;Monster Squid: The Giant Is Real&quot; on 27 January 2013, and on &quot;Giant Squid: Filming the Impossible – Natural World Special&quot; on BBC Two. To capture the footage the team aboard OceanX&#x27;s vessel MV Alucia traveled to the Ogasawara Islands, south of Tokyo and utilized the ship&#x27;s crewed submersibles. The squid was about long and was missing its feeding tentacles, likely from a failed attack by a sperm whale. It was drawn into viewing range by both artificial bioluminescence created to mimic panicking Atolla jellyfish and by using a &quot;Thysanoteuthis rhombus&quot; (diamond squid) as bait. The giant squid was filmed feeding for about 23 minutes by Tsunemi Kubodera until it departed. The technique of using unobtrusive viewing and bioluminescence luring of the squid with quiet unobtrusive platforms was described by Edith Widder, a member of the expedition.

===== Second video of giant squid in natural habitat =====
On 19 June 2019, in an expedition run by the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Association (NOAA), known as the Journey to Midnight, biologists Nathan J. Robinson and Edith Widder captured a video of a juvenile giant squid at a depth of 759 meters (2,490 feet) in the Gulf of Mexico. Michael Vecchione, a NOAA Fisheries zoologist, confirmed that the captured footage was that of the genus &quot;Architeuthis&quot;, and that the individual filmed measured at somewhere between .

===== Other sightings =====

Videos of live giant squids have been occasionally captured near the surface since the 2012 sighting, with one of these aforementioned individuals being guided back into the open ocean after appearing in Toyama Harbor on 24 December 2015. The majority of these sightings were of sick or dying individuals that had come up to the surface.

== Aquarium keeping ==

The giant squid cannot be kept in aquariums due to its hard-to-reach habitat, body size, and special needs. In 2022, a live specimen was found off the coast of Japan, and an attempt was made to transport it to the Echizen Matsushima Aquarium in the city of Sakai.

== Cultural depictions ==
Representations of the giant squid have been known from early legends of the kraken through books such as &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; on to other novels such as Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;, Peter Benchley&#x27;s &quot;Beast&quot; (adapted as a film called &quot;The Beast&quot;), and Michael Crichton &quot;Sphere&quot; (adapted as a film).

In particular, the image of a giant squid locked in battle with a sperm whale is a common one, although the squid is the whale&#x27;s prey and not an equal combatant.

<text>An Amber alert (alternatively styled AMBER alert) or a child abduction emergency alert (SAME code: CAE) is a message distributed by a child abduction alert system to ask the public for help in finding abducted children. The system originated in the United States.

The Amber alert was created in reference to Amber Rene Hagerman, who was abducted and later found murdered on January 17, 1996. Alternative regional alert names were once used; in Georgia, &quot;Levi&#x27;s Call&quot; (in memory of Levi Frady); in Hawaii, &quot;Maile Amber Alert&quot; (in memory of Maile Gilbert); in Arkansas, &quot;Morgan Nick Amber Alert&quot; (in memory of Morgan Nick); in Utah, &quot;Rachael Alert&quot; (in memory of Rachael Runyan); and in Idaho, &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Law&quot; (in memory of Michael “Monkey” Joseph Vaughan).

In the United States, the alerts are distributed via commercial and public radio stations, Internet radio, satellite radio, television stations, text messages, and cable TV by the Emergency Alert System and NOAA Weather Radio (where they are termed &quot;Amber Alerts&quot;). The alerts are also issued via e-mail, electronic traffic-condition signs, commercial electronic billboards, or through wireless device SMS text messages.

The US Justice Department&#x27;s Amber Alert Program has also teamed up with Google and Facebook to relay information regarding an Amber alert to an ever-growing demographic: Amber alerts are automatically displayed if citizens search or use map features on Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and other search engines. With Google public alert (also called Google Amber Alert in some countries), citizens see an Amber alert if they search for related information in a particular location where a minor has recently been abducted and an alert was issued. This is a component of the Amber alert system that is already active in the US (there are also developments in Europe). Those interested in subscribing to receive Amber alerts in their area via SMS messages can visit Wireless Amber alerts, which are offered by law as free messages. In some states, the display scrollboards in front of lottery terminals are also used.

The decision to declare an Amber alert is made by each police organization (in many cases, the state police or highway patrol) investigating the abduction. Public information in an Amber alert usually includes the name and description of the abductee, a description of the suspected abductor, and a description and license plate number of the abductor&#x27;s vehicle if available.

== Activation criteria ==

The alerts are broadcast using the Emergency Alert System, which had previously been used primarily for weather bulletins, civil emergencies, or national emergencies. In Canada, alerts are broadcast via Alert Ready, a Canadian emergency warning system. Alerts usually contain a description of the child and of the likely abductor. To avoid both false alarms and having alerts ignored as a &quot;wolf cry&quot;, the criteria for issuing an alert are rather strict. Each state&#x27;s or province&#x27;s Amber alert plan sets its own criteria for activation, meaning that there are differences between alerting agencies as to which incidents are considered to justify the use of the system. However, the U.S. Department of Justice issues the following &quot;guidance&quot;, which most states are said to &quot;adhere closely to&quot; (in the U.S.):

# Law enforcement must confirm that an abduction has taken place.
# The child must be at risk of serious injury or death.
# There must be sufficient descriptive information of child, captor, or captor&#x27;s vehicle to issue an alert.
# The child must be under 18 years of age.

Many law enforcement agencies have not used #2 as a criterion, resulting in many parental abductions triggering an Amber alert, where the child is not known or assumed to be at risk of serious injury or death. In 2013, West Virginia passed Skylar&#x27;s Law to eliminate #1 as a criterion for triggering an Amber Alert.

It is recommended that Amber alert data immediately be entered into the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center. Text information describing the circumstances surrounding the abduction of the child should be entered, and the case flagged as child abduction.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s (RCMP) requirements in Canada are nearly identical to the above list, with the exception that the RCMP is notified. One organization might notify the other if there is reason to suspect that the border may be crossed.

When investigators believe that a child is in danger of being taken across the border to either Canada or Mexico, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, United States Border Patrol and the Canada Border Services Agency are notified and are expected to search every car coming through a border checkpoint. If the child is suspected to be taken to Canada, a Canadian Amber Alert can also be issued, and a pursuit by Canadian authorities usually follows.

===Incidents not meeting alert criteria===
For incidents which do not meet Amber alert criteria, the United States Department of Justice developed the Child Abduction Response Teams (CART) program to assist local agencies. This program can be used in all missing children&#x27;s cases with or without an Amber alert. CART can also be used to help recover runaway children who are under the age of 18 and in danger. , 225 response teams have been trained in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and Canada.

==Namesake==

Amber Rene Hagerman (November 25, 1986 – January 15, 1996) was a nine-year-old girl abducted while riding her bike in Arlington, Texas. Her younger brother, Ricky, had gone home without her because Amber had wanted to stay in the parking lot for a while. When he returned with his grandfather, they only found her bicycle. A neighbor who had witnessed the abduction called 911.

On hearing the news, Hagerman&#x27;s father, Richard, called Marc Klaas, whose daughter, Polly, had been kidnapped and murdered in Petaluma, California, in 1993 and Amber&#x27;s mother, Donna Whitson (now Donna Williams), called the news media and the FBI. They and their neighbors began searching for Amber.

Four days after her abduction, near midnight, a man walking his dog discovered Amber&#x27;s naked body in a creek behind an apartment complex with severe laceration wounds to her neck. The site of the discovery was less than five miles (8 km) from where she was abducted. Her murder remains unsolved.

==Texas program development==
Within days of Amber&#x27;s death, Donna Williams was &quot;calling for tougher laws governing kidnappers and sex offenders&quot;. Amber&#x27;s parents soon established People Against Sex Offenders (PASO). They collected signatures hoping to force the Texas Legislature into passing more stringent laws to protect children.

God&#x27;s Place International Church donated the first office space for the organization, and as the search for Amber&#x27;s killer continued, PASO received almost-daily coverage in local media. Companies donated various office supplies, including computer and Internet service. Congressman Martin Frost, with the help of Marc Klaas, drafted the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act. Both of Hagerman&#x27;s parents were present when President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, creating the national sex offender registry. Williams and Richard Hagerman then began collecting signatures in Texas, which they planned to present to then-Governor George W. Bush as a sign that people wanted more stringent laws for sex offenders.

In July 1996, Bruce Seybert (whose own daughter was a close friend of Amber) and Richard Hagerman attended a media symposium in Arlington. Although Hagerman had remarks prepared, on the day of the event the organizers asked Seybert to speak instead. In his 20-minute speech, he spoke about efforts that local police could take quickly to help find missing children and how the media could facilitate those efforts. C.J. Wheeler, a reporter from radio station KRLD, approached the Dallas police chief shortly afterward with Seybert&#x27;s ideas and launched the first ever Amber Alert.

Williams testified in front of the U.S. Congress in June 1996, asking legislators to create a nationwide registry of sex offenders. Representative Martin Frost, the Congressman who represents Williams&#x27; district, proposed an &quot;Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act.&quot; Among the sections of the bill was one that would create a national sex offender registry.

Diana Simone, a Texas resident who had been following the news, contacted the KDMX radio station and proposed broadcasts to engage passers-by in helping locate missing children. Her idea was picked up and for the next two years, alerts were made manually to participating radio stations. In 1998, the Child Alert Foundation created the first fully automated Alert Notification System (ANS) to notify surrounding communities when a child was reported missing or abducted. Alerts were sent to radio stations as originally requested but included television stations, surrounding law enforcement agencies, newspapers and local support organizations. These alerts were sent all at once via pagers, faxes, emails, and cell phones with the information immediately posted on the Internet for the general public to view.

Following the automation of the Amber alert with ANS technology created by the Child Alert Foundation, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) expanded its role in 2002 to promote the Amber alert.

== International adoption ==
===United States===
In October 2000, the United States House of Representatives adopted H.Res.605, which encouraged communities nationwide to implement the Amber Plan. In October 2001, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that had declined to be a part of the Amber alert program in February 1996, launched a campaign to have Amber alert systems established nationwide. In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission officially endorsed the system. In 2002, several children were abducted in cases that drew national attention. One such case, the kidnapping and murder of Samantha Runnion, prompted California to establish an Amber alert system on July 24, 2002. According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, in its first month California issued 13 Amber alerts; 12 of the children were recovered safely and the remaining alert was found to be a misunderstanding.

By September 2002, 26 states had established Amber alert systems that covered all or parts of the state. A bipartisan group of US Senators, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein, proposed legislation to name an Amber alert coordinator in the U.S. Justice Department who could help coordinate state efforts. The bill also provided $25 million in federal matching grants for states to establish Amber alert programs and necessary equipment purchases, such as electronic highway signs. A similar bill was sponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Jennifer Dunn and Martin Frost. The bill passed the Senate unanimously within a week of its proposal. At an October 2002 conference on missing, exploited, and runaway children, President George W. Bush announced changes to the Amber Alert system, including the development of a national standard for issuing Amber Alerts. A similar bill passed the House several weeks later on a 390–24 vote. A related bill finally became law in April 2003.

The alerts were offered digitally beginning in November 2002, when America Online began a service allowing people to sign up to receive notification via computer, pager, or cell phone. Users of the service enter their ZIP Code, thus allowing the alerts to be targeted to specific geographic regions.

By 2005, all fifty states had operational programs and today the program operates across state and jurisdictional boundaries. , Amber Alerts are automatically sent through the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) program.

===Canada===
Canada&#x27;s system began in December 2002, when Alberta launched the first province-wide system. At the time, Alberta Solicitor-General Heather Forsyth said &quot;We anticipate an Amber Alert will only be issued once a year in Alberta. We hope we never have to use it, but if a child is abducted Amber Alert is another tool police can use to find them and help them bring the child home safely.&quot; The Alberta government committed to spending more than CA$1 million to expanding the province&#x27;s emergency warning system so that it could be used effectively for Amber Alerts. Other provinces soon adopted the system, and by May 2004, Saskatchewan was the only province that had not established an Amber Alert system. Within the next year, the program was in use throughout the country.

Amber alerts may also be distributed via the Alert Ready emergency alert system, which disrupts programming on all radio, television stations, and television providers in the relevant region to display and play audio of Amber alert information. In 2018, Alert Ready introduced alerts on supported mobile devices. When an alert is broadcast, a distinct sound is played and a link to find more information is displayed onscreen. Currently, there is no way to deactivate Amber alerts on mobile devices in Canada, even if the device is in silent and/or Do Not Disturb modes, which has provoked controversy. These series of multiple blaring alarms going off in the middle of the night have caused residents to complain, often by calling 911. However, there are concerns that hearing repeated alarms may cause Canadians to ignore the alarm when the system is used to warn of life-threatening emergencies.

==== British Columbia ====
Translink, the corporation responsible for the regional transportation network of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, displays Amber alerts on all their buses&#x27; digital signs reading &quot;AMBER ALERT | Listen to radio | Bus #&quot;. Details of the Amber alert information are also available on screens at transit stations.

==== Quebec ====
The program was introduced in Quebec on May 26, 2003. The name AMBER alert was then adapted in French to Alerte Médiatique But Enfant Recherché, which directly translates as &quot;Media Alert Goal of Child Recovery&quot;. In order to launch an AMBER alert, police authorities need to meet four criteria simultaneously and with no exceptions:
# The missing person is a child under the age of 18.
# The police have reason to believe that the missing child has been abducted.
# The police have reason to believe that the physical safety or the life of the child is in serious danger.
# The police have information that may help locate the child, the suspect and/or the suspect&#x27;s vehicle.

Once all four conditions are met, the police service may call an AMBER alert. Simultaneously, all of Quebec&#x27;s Ministry of transport message boards will broadcast the police&#x27;s messages. The Société de l&#x27;assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) road traffic controllers also help with the search. Television and radio stations broadcast a description of the child, the abductor and/or the abductor&#x27;s car. On the radio, the information is broadcast every 20 minutes for two hours or less if the child is found. On the television, the information is broadcast on a ticker tape at the bottom of the screen for two hours with no interruptions. After this, the ticker tape is withdrawn, but the police continue to inform the public through the usual means of communication.

Over the years, the program gathered more partners in order for the alert to be communicated on different media platforms. As in Ontario, lottery crown corporation Loto-Québec puts to the disposition of the police forces their 8,500 terminals located throughout the province. Some of these terminals are equipped with a screen that faces the customer which makes it one of the largest networks of its kind to operate in Canada. The technology employed enables them to broadcast the message on the entire network in under 10 minutes. In addition, The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association (CWTA) offers to most Canadians, upon free subscription, the possibility to receive, via text message, on their mobile devices AMBER alert notices.

==== Ontario ====
Ontario furthered its reach beyond media and highway signs by offering Amber alerts on the province&#x27;s 9,000 lottery terminal screens.

After the abduction and murder of Victoria Stafford, an online petition was started by Suzie Pereira, a single mother of 2 children who gathered over 61,000 signatures, prompting a review of the Amber Alert. There was some concern regarding the strict criteria for issuing the alerts – criteria that were not met in the Stafford case – that resulted in an alert not being issued. Ontario Provincial Police have since changed their rules for issuing an alert from having to &quot;confirm&quot; an abduction and &quot;confirm&quot; threat of harm, to &quot;believe&quot; that a child has been abducted and &quot;believe&quot; is at risk of harm.

===Mexico===
Mexico joined international efforts to spread the use of the Amber alert at an official launch ceremony on April 28, 2011.

===Australia===

The Australian state of Queensland implemented a version of the Amber alerts in May 2005. Other Australian states joined Queensland in Facebook&#x27;s Amber Alert program in June 2017.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Police launched their own version of the system in November 2017. On Activation, it will insert information about the missing individual in the news feeds of Facebook users in the target area, and News Media organisations are alerted.

===Europe===
AMBER Alert Europe is a foundation that strives to improve the protection of missing children by empowering children and raising awareness on the issue of missing children and its root causes. AMBER Alert Europe advocates that one missing child is one too many and aims for zero missing children in Europe.

AMBER Alert Europe is a neutral platform for the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and best practices on the issue of missing children and its roots causes. To contribute to a safer environment for children, it connects experts from 44 non-governmental and governmental organisations, as well as business entities from 28 countries across Europe.

Its activities cover prevention and awareness-raising, training, research, and child alerting, as well as launching initiatives aimed at impacting policies and legislation in the area of children’s rights. All activities are implemented in line with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child and with respect for the privacy of children and data protection laws.

Its beginnings

As a response to missing children cases exceeding geographical borders, the AMBER Alert Europe Foundation was founded in 2013 to contribute to better cross-border coordination and cooperation in the search for missing children.

Since then, its network has expanded and now encompasses different experts from a variety of backgrounds who make their know-how and experiences available to improve existing practices and procedures for a fast and safe recovery of children gone missing. Its joint efforts with police experts in the field of missing children even paved the way for a European police expert network in this area.

With the objective to prevent children from going missing, it also develop activities in the area of prevention, awareness-raising, research, and training together with its network of experts.

====France====
In February 2006, France&#x27;s Justice ministry launched an apparatus based on the AMBER alerts named Alerte-Enlèvement (&quot;abduction alert&quot;) or Dispositif Alerte-Enlèvement (&quot;abduction alert apparatus&quot;) with the help of most media and railroad and motorway companies.

====Netherlands====

AMBER Alert Netherlands was launched in 2008. On February 14, 2009, the first Dutch AMBER alert was issued when a 4-year-old boy went missing in Rotterdam. He was found safe and sound after being recognized by a person who saw his picture on an electronic billboard in a fast food restaurant. He was recovered so quickly, that the transmission of the AMBER alert was halted before all recipients received it.

An AMBER alert is issued when a child is missing or abducted and the Dutch police fear that the life or health of the child is in imminent danger. The system enables the police to immediately alert press and public nationwide, by means of electronic highway signs, TV, radio, social media, PCs, large advertising screens (digital signage), email, text messages, apps, RSS news feeds, website banners and pop-ups. There are four key criteria in The Netherlands to be met before an AMBER Alert is issued:
# The child is (very likely) abducted by an unknown person or persons or the child is missing and its life is in imminent danger
# The victim is a minor (under 18 years of age);
# There is enough information about the victim to increase the chances of the child being found by means of an AMBER alert, such as a photo, information about the abductor or the vehicle used during the abduction;
# The AMBER alert is issued as soon as possible after the abduction or disappearance of the child.
In 2021, Dutch police authorities proposed to merge Amber alerts into the &quot;Burgernet&quot; system. Parliament blocked the initiative. Dutch police continues to send Amber alerts through Burgernet as well as its own social media.

====United Kingdom====
On April 1, 2007, the AMBER alert system became active in North West England. An implementation across the rest of Britain was planned at that time. This was realized on May 25, 2010, with the nationwide launch of the Child Rescue Alert, based on the AMBER alert system. The first system in the UK of this kind was created in Sussex on November 14, 2002. This was followed by versions in Surrey and Hampshire. By 2005, every local jurisdiction in England and Wales had its own form of alert system. The system was first used in the UK on October 3, 2012, with regard to missing 5 year-old April Jones in Wales.

====Ireland====
In April 2009, it was announced that an AMBER alert system would be set up in Ireland, In May 2012, the Child Rescue Ireland (CRI) Alert was officially introduced. Ireland&#x27;s first AMBER alert was issued upon the disappearance of two boys, Eoghan (10) and Ruairí Chada (5).

====Serbia====
The AMBER alert system, called &quot;&quot; () started operating in Serbia on October 25, 2023. It was first activated on March 26, 2024 due to the disappearance of two-year-old girl, Danka Ilić, in Banjsko Polje in Bor.

The alerts are distributed via SMS messages and TV programs.

====Slovakia====
Since April 2015, an emergency child abduction alert system &quot;AMBER Alert Slovakia&quot; is also available in Slovakia. (www.amberalert.sk)

====Ukraine====
On 22 September 2021, Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Digital Transformation, the National Police of Ukraine and Facebook announced the launch of AMBER alert in Ukraine.

===China===
On 15 May 2016, the Ministry of Public Security of the People&#x27;s Republic of China announced the Ministry of Public Security Emergency Release Platform for Children&#x27;s Missing Information in Beijing, which was soon rolled out to the rest of the country. It is run by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security and receives technical support from Alibaba Group. The platform pushes information of missing children confirmed by the police to the mobile phones of the people around the place where the children disappeared, to mobilise people in the area to find and provide feedback on clues related to abductions, trafficking, and related crimes in the area.

=== Ecuador ===
In 2018, Ecuador&#x27;s Department of Security introduced its own Amber alert called Emilia alert, named after the abducted girl Emilia Benavides in December 2017.

===Malaysia===
In September 2007, Malaysia implemented the Nurin Alert. Based on the Amber alert, it is named for a missing eight-year-old girl, Nurin Jazlin.

=== Morocco ===
In March 2023, the General Directorate of National Security of Morocco developed a system in cooperation with Meta Platforms based on the Amber Alert, named &quot;Tifli Moukhtafi&quot; (). The alerts are distributed via SMS and on platforms owned by Meta.

=== Russia ===
In 2019, Megafon developed its own alert system called MegaFon.Poisk. It is oriented for all regions of Russia where MegaFon is represented and is used for searches of children and adults as well. For less than half of a year, the service has been used for searching of more than 250 people and in more than 30% of situations people called back with information about a lost person.

==Retrieval rates==
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, of the children abducted and murdered by strangers, 75% are killed within the first three hours of their abduction. Amber alerts are designed to inform the general public quickly when a child has been kidnapped and is in danger so &quot;the public [would be] additional eyes and ears of law enforcement&quot;. , the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said 1,186 children were recovered because of the Amber alert program.

A Scripps Howard study of the 233 Amber alerts in the United States in 2004 found that most issued alerts did not meet the Department of Justice&#x27;s criteria. That is, 50% (117 alerts) were categorized as family abductions&quot;, e.g., a parent involved in a custody dispute. There were 48 alerts for children who had not been abducted at all, but were lost, ran away, involved in family misunderstandings (for example, two instances where the child was with grandparents), or as the result of hoaxes. Another 23 alerts were issued in cases where police did not know the name of the allegedly abducted child, often as the result of misunderstandings by witnesses who reported an abduction. Seventy of the 233 Amber alerts issued in 2004 (30%) were actually children taken by strangers or who were unlawfully travelling with adults other than their legal guardians.

According to the &quot;2014 Amber Alert Report&quot;, 186 Amber alerts were issued in the US, involving 239 children – 60 who were taken by strangers or people other than their legal guardians.

==Similar alerts==

Some municipalities have used the wireless emergency alert system for categories of people beyond missing children.

In 2012, California created the &quot;silver alert&quot; for missing elderly people, followed by the &quot;feather alert&quot; for missing Indigenous people in 2022, and then the &quot;ebony alert&quot; for missing Black children and young women. Supporters of the ebony alert say that this will dedicate resources to missing Black youths that may not be given sufficient attention through Amber alerts.

Since 2008, Texas has implemented the &quot;blue alert&quot; for suspected cases of serious injury to police officers.

==Controversies==
===Crime control theater===
Some outside scholars examining the system in depth disagree with the &quot;official&quot; results. A research team led by criminologist Timothy Griffin reviewed hundreds of abduction cases that occurred between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber alerts actually had little apparent role in the eventual return of abducted children. The Amber alerts tended to be &quot;successful&quot; in relatively mundane abductions, such as when the child was taken by a noncustodial parent or other family member. There was little evidence that Amber alerts routinely &quot;saved lives&quot;, although a crucial research constraint was the impossibility of knowing with certainty what would have happened if no alert had been issued in a particular case.

Griffin and coauthor Monica Miller articulated the limits to Amber alerts in a subsequent research article. They stated that alerts are inherently constrained, because to be successful in the most menacing cases there needs to be a rapid synchronization of several events (rapid discovery that the child is missing and subsequent alert, the fortuitous discovery of the child or abductor by a citizen, and so forth). Furthermore, there is a contradiction between the need for rapid recovery and the prerogative to maintain the strict issuance criteria to reduce the number of frivolous alerts, creating a dilemma for law enforcement officials and public backlash when alerts are not issued in cases ending as tragedies. Finally, the implied causal model of alert (rapid recovery can save lives) is in a sense the opposite of reality: in the worst abduction scenarios, the intentions of the perpetrator usually guarantee that anything public officials do will be &quot;too slow&quot;.

Because the system is publicly praised for saving lives despite these limitations, Griffin and Miller argue that Amber alert acts as &quot;crime control theater&quot; in that it &quot;creates the appearance but not the fact of crime control&quot;. AMBER Alert is thus a socially constructed &quot;solution&quot; to the rare but intractable crime of child-abduction murder. Griffin and Miller have subsequently applied the concept to other emotional but ineffective legislation such as safe-haven laws and polygamy raids. Griffin considers his findings preliminary, reporting his team examined only a portion of the Amber alerts issued over the three-year period they focused on, so he recommends taking a closer look at the evaluation of the program and its intended purpose, instead of simply promoting the program.

===Overuse and desensitization===
Advocates for missing children have expressed concerns that the public is gradually becoming desensitized to Amber alerts because of a large number of false or overly broad alarms, where police issue an Amber alert without strictly adhering to the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s activation guidelines.

The timing of a July 2013 New York child abduction alert sent through the Wireless Emergency Alerts system at 4 a.m. raised concerns that many cellphone users would disable WEA alerts.

In 2024, the Texas Department of Public Safety sent a blue alert at 4:50 a.m. to cell phones across the state, some as far as eight hours&#x27; drive away from the incident location. The alert prompted thousands of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission, along with public expressions of disbelief that the state government would expect private individuals to wake up in the middle of the night to search for the suspect.

===Health effects===
A family in Texas claimed their child suffered a ruptured eardrum and inner ear damage, resulting in permanent hearing loss and tinnitus, when an Amber alert was pushed through his earphones at an &quot;ear-shattering volume&quot;.

==Effects on traffic==

Amber alerts are often displayed on electronic message signs. The Federal Highway Administration has instructed states to display alerts on highway signs sparingly, citing safety concerns from distracted drivers and the negative impacts of traffic congestion.

Many states have policies in place that limit the use of Amber alerts on freeway signs. In Los Angeles, an Amber alert issued in October 2002 that was displayed on area freeway signs caused significant traffic congestion. As a result, the California Highway Patrol elected not to display the alerts during rush hour, citing safety concerns. The state of Wisconsin only displays Amber alerts on freeway signs if it is deemed appropriate by the transportation department and a public safety agency. Amber alerts do not preempt messages related to traffic safety.

==Influence==
The United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp commemorating Amber alerts in May 2006. The 39-cent stamp features a chalk pastel drawing by artist Vivienne Flesher of a reunited mother and child, with the text &quot;AMBER ALERT saves missing children&quot; across the pane. The stamp was released as part of the observance of National Missing Children&#x27;s Day.

In 2006, a TV movie, &quot;Amber&#x27;s Story&quot;, was broadcast on Lifetime. It starred Elisabeth Röhm and Sophie Hough.

A comic book entitled &quot;Amber Hagerman Deserves Justice: A Night Owl Story&quot; was published by Wham Bang Comics in 2009. Geared toward a young audience by teen author Jake Tinsley and manga artist Jason Dube, it tells Amber&#x27;s story, recounts the investigation into her murder, and touches on the effect her death has had on young children and parents everywhere. It was created to promote what was then a reopened investigation into her murder.

<doc id="215424" wikidata="Q858049" url="?curid=215424" title="Instant coffee">
<text>Instant coffee is a beverage derived from brewed coffee beans that enables people to quickly prepare hot coffee by adding hot water or milk to coffee solids in powdered or crystallized form and stirring. The product was first invented in Invercargill, the largest city in Southland, New Zealand, in 1890. Instant coffee solids (also called soluble coffee, coffee crystals, coffee powder, or powdered coffee) refers to the dehydrated and packaged solids available at retail used to make instant coffee. Instant coffee solids are commercially prepared by either freeze-drying or spray drying, after which it can be rehydrated. Instant coffee in a concentrated liquid form, as a beverage, is also manufactured. 

Advantages of instant coffee include speed of preparation (instant coffee dissolves quickly in hot water), lower shipping weight and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare the same amount of beverage), and long shelf life—though instant coffee can spoil if not kept dry. Instant coffee also reduces cleanup since there are no coffee grounds, and at least one study has found that it has a lower environmental footprint than drip filter coffee and capsule espresso coffee, on a prepared beverage basis, disregarding quality and appeal of the beverage produced.

==History==

A concentrated coffee/milk/sugar mixture was produced for the Union army during the American Civil War under the name &quot;Essence of Coffee&quot;, a teaspoonful of which was mixed with a cup of hot water. It had the consistency of axle grease, and proved so unpopular with the troops that it was soon discontinued. The brand Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, was first produced in 1876 by Paterson &amp; Sons Ltd in Scotland.

The invention for instant or soluble coffee was filed 28 January 1889 and patented in 1890, by David Strang of Invercargill, New Zealand, under patent number 3518. It was sold under the trading name Strang&#x27;s Coffee citing the patented &quot;Dry Hot-Air&quot; process. Some modern sources have credited French humorist and writer Alphonse Allais with the invention.

The invention was previously attributed to Satori Kato, a Japanese scientist working in Chicago in 1901. Kato introduced the powdered substance in Buffalo, New York, at the Pan-American Exposition. George Constant Louis Washington developed his own instant coffee process shortly thereafter, and first marketed it commercially (1910). The Nescafé brand, which introduced a more advanced coffee refining process, was launched in 1938.

High-vacuum freeze-dried coffee was developed shortly after World War II, as an indirect result of wartime research into other areas. The National Research Corporation (NRC) was formed in Massachusetts as a process-development company employing high-vacuum technology. It developed high-vacuum processes to produce penicillin, blood plasma, and streptomycin for US military use. As the war ended, NRC looked to adapt its processes for peacetime uses. It formed Florida Foods Corporation to produce concentrated orange juice powder and originally sold its product to the United States Army. That company later changed its name to Minute Maid.
==Use==

Close to 50% of the world&#x27;s green coffee is used to produce instant coffee.

===As food===

Instant coffee is available in powder or granulated form contained in glass and plastic jars, sachets, or tins. The user controls the strength of the resulting product by adding less or more powder or granules to the water.

Instant coffee is also convenient for preparing iced coffee like the Greek frappé.

In some countries, such as Portugal, Spain, and India, instant coffee is commonly mixed with hot milk instead of boiling water. In other countries, such as South Korea, instant coffee commonly comes pre-mixed with non-dairy creamer and sugar and is called &quot;coffee mix&quot;. Said to have been popularised in the UK by GIs during World War II, instant coffee still accounts for over 75 percent of coffee bought to drink in British homes, as opposed to well under 10 percent in the U.S. and France and one percent in Italy.

In the United Kingdom, instant coffee granules are sometimes used to enhance the flavour of sauces used in preparing spaghetti Bolognese.

===Non-food uses===
Instant coffee is one of the ingredients in Caffenol, a home-made, non-toxic black-and-white photographic developer. The other ingredients in the basic formula are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and anhydrous sodium carbonate; some recipes also include potassium bromide as a fog-reducing agent. The active ingredient appears to be caffeic acid. Initial experiments on Caffenol were performed in 1995 at the Rochester Institute of Technology; addition of ascorbic acid began around 2000, yielding the improved Caffenol-C, which is less likely to stain negatives than the original formulation. Experiments have shown that cheaper, less desirable brands of coffee work better for this application than more expensive brands.

In crafts, Instant coffee can be used as a dye to stain paper and give the impression of it being aged.

==Production==

As with regular coffee, the green coffee bean itself is first roasted to bring out flavour and aroma. Rotating cylinders containing the green beans and hot combustion gases are used in most roasting plants. When the bean temperature reaches the roasting begins. It takes about 8–15 minutes to complete roasting. After cooling, the beans are then ground finely. Grinding reduces the beans to pieces. Until here, the process is in general the same as for other types of coffee.

===Extraction===
To produce instant coffee, the soluble and volatile contents of the beans, which provide the coffee aroma and flavor, have to be extracted. This is done using water. Pressurized water heated to around is used for this process. The coffee concentration in the liquid is then increased by either evaporation or by freeze concentration.

===Freeze drying===

The basic principle of freeze drying is the removal of water by sublimation.

Since the mass production of instant coffee began in post-WWII America, freeze-drying has grown in popularity to become a common method. Although it is more expensive, it generally results in a higher-quality product.

# The coffee extract is rapidly frozen and is broken into small granules. (Slower freezing would lead to larger ice crystals and a porous product; it can also affect the colour of the coffee granules).
# The granules are sifted and sorted on size.
# Frozen coffee granules are placed in the drying chamber, often on metal trays.
# A vacuum is created within the chamber. The strength of the vacuum is critical in the speed of the drying and therefore the quality of the product. Care must be taken to produce a vacuum of suitable strength.
# The drying chamber is warmed, most commonly by radiation, but conduction is used in some plants and convection has been proposed in some small pilot plants. A possible problem with convection is uneven drying rates within the chamber, which would give an inferior product.
# Sublimation—the previously frozen water in the coffee granules expands to ten times its previous volume. The removal of this water vapor from the chamber is vitally important, making the condenser the most critical and expensive component in a freeze-drying plant.
# The freeze-dried granules are removed from the chamber and packaged.

===Spray drying===

Spray drying is preferred to freeze-drying in some cases because it allows larger scale economic production, shorter drying times, and because it produces fine rounded particles.

The process produces spherical particles about in size with a density of 0.22 g/cm3. To achieve this, nozzle atomization is used. Various ways of nozzle atomization can be used each having its own advantages and disadvantages. High speed rotating wheels operating at speeds of about 20,000 rpm are able to process up to of solution per hour. The use of spray wheels requires that the drying towers have a wide radius to avoid the atomized droplets collecting onto the drying chamber walls.
* Completed in 5–30 seconds (dependent on factors such as heat, size of particle, and diameter of chamber).
* Moisture content change: IN = 75–85% OUT = 3–3.5%
* Air temperature: IN = OUT = 

One drawback with spray drying is that the particles it produces are too fine to be used effectively by the consumer; they must first be either steam-fused in towers similar to spray dryers or by belt agglomeration to produce particles of suitable size.

===Decaffeination===

In commercial processes, the decaffeination of instant coffee almost always happens before the critical roasting process which will determine the coffee&#x27;s flavour and aroma processes.

The main byproduct of the instant coffee production process is spent coffee grounds. These grounds can be used as biomass, for example to produce heat used in the manufacturing process. Roughly two times the mass in spent coffee grounds is generated for each quantity of soluble coffee.

==Composition==
The caffeine content of instant coffee is generally less than that of brewed coffee. One study comparing various home-prepared samples came to the result that regular instant coffee (not decaffeinated) has a median caffeine content of 66 mg per cup (range 29–117 mg per cup), with a median cup size of 225 ml (range 170–285 ml) and a caffeine concentration of 328 μg/mL (range 102–559 μg/mL). In comparison, drip or filter coffee was estimated to have a median caffeine content of 112 mg, with a median concentration of 621 μg/mL for the same cup size.

Regarding antioxidants, the polyphenol content of a 180 ml cup of instant coffee has been estimated to be approximately 320 mg, compared to approximately 400 mg in a cup of brewed coffee of the same size.

==Malabsorption==
Instant coffee decreases intestinal iron absorption more than drip coffee. One study estimated that, when a cup of instant coffee was ingested with a meal composed of semipurified ingredients, intestinal absorption was reduced from 5.88% to 0.97%, compared to an absorption of 1.64% with drip coffee. It was also estimated that, when the strength of the instant coffee was doubled, intestinal iron absorption fell to 0.53%. However, there is no decrease in iron absorption when instant coffee is consumed 1 hour before a meal, but the same degree of inhibition as with simultaneous ingestion occurs when instant coffee is taken 1 hour after a meal.

==Regulation==
In the European Union, regulations include the species of coffee bean, geographical origin, processing detail, year of crop, solvents used in decaffeination, and caffeine level.

Various institutions govern the coffee industry and help to achieve standardization and release information to the public, including the International Coffee Organization (London), Codex Alimentarius Commission of the UN (Rome), and National Coffee Association (New York).

<text>Sir Bernard Katz, FRS (; 26 March 1911 – 20 April 2003) was a German-born British physician and biophysicist, noted for his work on nerve physiology; specifically, for his work on synaptic transmission at the nerve-muscle junction. He shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1970 with Julius Axelrod and Ulf von Euler. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1969.

==Life and career==
Katz was born in Leipzig, Germany, to a Jewish family originally from Russia, the son of Eugenie (Rabinowitz) and Max Katz, a fur merchant. He was educated at the Albert Gymnasium in that city from 1921 to 1929 and went on to study medicine at the University of Leipzig. He graduated in 1934 and fled to Britain in February 1935.

Katz went to work at University College London, initially under the tutelage of Archibald Vivian Hill. He finished his PhD in 1938 and won a Carnegie Fellowship to study with John Carew Eccles at the Kanematsu Institute of Sydney Medical School. During this time, both he and Eccles gave research lectures at the University of Sydney. He obtained British nationality in 1941 and joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942. He spent the war in the Pacific as a radar officer and in 1946 was invited back to UCL as an assistant director by Hill. For three years until 1949, the Katz family lived with Hill and his wife Margaret in the top flat of their house in Highgate.

Back in England he also worked with the 1963 Nobel prize winners Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley. Katz was made a professor at UCL in 1952 and head of the Biophysics Department; he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952. He stayed as head of Biophysics until 1978 when he became emeritus professor.

Katz married Marguerite Penly in 1945. He died in London on 20 April 2003, at the age of 92. His son Jonathan is Public Orator of The University of Oxford.

==Research==
His research uncovered fundamental properties of synapses, the junctions across which nerve cells signal to each other and to other types of cells. By the 1950s, he was studying the biochemistry and action of acetylcholine, a signalling molecule found in synapses linking motor neurons to muscles, used to stimulate contraction. Katz won the Nobel for his discovery with Paul Fatt that neurotransmitter release at synapses is &quot;quantal&quot;, meaning that at any particular synapse, the amount of neurotransmitter released is never less than a certain amount, and if more is always an integral number times this amount. Scientists now understand that this circumstance arises because, prior to their release into the synaptic gap, transmitter molecules reside in like-sized subcellular packages known as synaptic vesicles, released in a similar way to any other vesicle during exocytosis.

Katz&#x27;s work had immediate influence on the study of organophosphates and organochlorines, the basis of new post-war study for nerve agents and pesticides, as he determined that the complex enzyme cycle was easily disrupted.

<text>The wagtails, longclaws, and pipits are a family, Motacillidae, of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. Around 70 species occur in five genera. The longclaws are entirely restricted to the Afrotropics, and the wagtails are predominantly found in Europe, Africa, and Asia, with two species migrating and breeding in Alaska. The pipits have the most cosmopolitan distribution, being found mostly in the Old World, but occurring also in the Americas and oceanic islands such as New Zealand and the Falklands. Two African species, the yellow-breasted pipit and Sharpe&#x27;s longclaw, are sometimes placed in a separate seventh genus, &quot;Hemimacronyx&quot;, which is closely related to the longclaws.

Most motacillids are ground-feeding insectivores of slightly open country. They occupy almost all available habitats, from the shore to high mountains. Wagtails prefer wetter habitats than the pipits. A few species use forests, including the forest wagtail, and other species use forested mountain streams, such as the grey wagtail or the mountain wagtail.

Motacillids take a wide range of invertebrate prey: insects are the most commonly taken, but also including spiders, worms, and small aquatic molluscs and arthropods. All species seem to be fairly catholic in their diets, and the most commonly taken prey for any particular species or population usually reflects local availability.

With the exception of the forest wagtail, they nest on the ground, laying up to six speckled eggs.

==Description==
Wagtails, pipits, and longclaws are slender, small to medium-sized passerines, ranging from in length, with short necks and long tails. They have long, pale legs with long toes and claws, particularly the hind toe, which can be up to 4 cm in length in some longclaws. No sexual dimorphism in size is seen. Overall, the robust longclaws are larger than the pipits and wagtails. Longclaws can weigh as much as 64 g, as in Fülleborn&#x27;s longclaw, whereas the weight range for pipits and wagtails is 15–31 g, with the smallest species being perhaps the yellowish pipit. The plumage of most pipits is dull brown and reminiscent of the larks, although some species have brighter plumages, particularly the golden pipit of north-east Africa. The adult male longclaws have brightly coloured undersides. The wagtails often have striking plumage, including grey, black, white, and yellow.

==Phylogeny==
A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 sampled 56 of the 68 recognised species in the family Motacillidae and found that the species formed six major clades. The pipit genus &quot;Anthus&quot; was paraphyletic with respect to the longclaw genus &quot;Macronyx&quot;. The striped pipit (&quot;Anthus lineiventris&quot;) and the African rock pipit (&quot;Anthus crenatus&quot;) were nested with the longclaws in &quot;Macronyx&quot;. The type species of &quot;Anthus&quot;, the meadow pipit, was nested with the other Palearctic species in Clade 2.

<doc id="215429" wikidata="Q40606" url="?curid=215429" title="Finnish cuisine">
<text>Finnish cuisine is notable for generally combining traditional country fare and &quot;haute cuisine&quot; with contemporary continental-style cooking. Fish and meat (usually pork, beef or reindeer) play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes in some parts of the country, while the dishes elsewhere have traditionally included various vegetables and mushrooms. Evacuees from Karelia contributed to foods in other parts of Finland in the aftermath of the Continuation War.

Finnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as bilberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn). Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food, drink or in various recipes. Various turnips were common in traditional cooking, but were replaced with the potato after its introduction in the 18th century.

== Characteristics ==
The way of life and culture of Finns was mainly based on agriculture already at prehistoric times. However, in the harsh and cold environment, agriculture was neither a very effective nor secure way of life, so getting food from nature has often been an important secondary livelihood. When crops failed, it might have been the only way to survive. Also, while farms mainly produced plants like crops or turnips, and often families had only some farm animals to get milk products and meat, hunting and especially fishing were important ways to get more protein. Large-scale meat production and therefore meat as a daily food started to emerge only at the beginning of 20th century, after periods of malnutrition in the 19th century caused by failed crops.

In former times, the country&#x27;s harsh climate meant that fresh fruit and vegetables were largely unavailable for at least nine months of the year, leading to a heavy reliance on staple tubers (initially turnip, later potato), dark rye bread and fermented dairy products, occasionally enlivened with preserved fish and meat. Traditionally, very few spices other than salt were available, and fresh herbs like dill and chives were limited to the summer months. Many Finnish traditional dishes are prepared by stewing them for a long time in an oven, which produces hearty but bland fare. Forests and lakes were historically a major source of food, and produce from forests currently accounts for the distinctive traits in Finnish cuisine. The simplicity of traditional Finnish food has been turned into an advantage by shifting the emphasis to freshness. Modern Finnish restaurateurs now blend high-quality Finnish products with continental cooking techniques. This approach helped Helsinki&#x27;s Chez Dominique to receive two Michelin stars in 2003. The restaurant closed in 2013.

Internationalization brought imported goods. As pasta, pizza, kebab, and hamburgers were integrated into Finnish menus, they displaced some traditional everyday dishes like &quot;kaalilaatikko&quot; (cabbage casserole), or herring fillets, which some consider inferior. As of the 20th century, when the majority of Finnish women entered the workforce, many traditional dishes that require long preparation time are reserved for holidays.

Even with modern agriculture and transportation, food remains expensive in Finland relative to other European countries. This is notwithstanding the effect of accession to the European Union in 1995. The consequent elimination of trade barriers led prices of products like grains, meat, and milk to drop as much as 50%. Before that, heavy taxes and outright bans on imports that competed with local produce severely limited the availability of foreign or unseasonal food. Nowadays Finnish supermarkets and restaurants provide a variety of food from all over the world.

Finnish cuisine is very similar to Swedish cuisine. Swedish dishes like &quot;Janssons frestelse&quot; (), &quot;pyttipannu&quot;, and &quot;gravlax&quot; () are common in Finland. The overarching difference is the Finns&#x27; preference for unsweetened foods. For example, while traditional Swedish rye bread includes plenty of syrup and spices, Finnish rye bread is unsweetened, even bitter. Finnish cuisine also bears some resemblance to German and Russian cuisines. Sausages and buttered bread (like &quot;Butterbrot&quot;), and (kissel) and (cf. pirozhki) are similar to their respective German and Russian counterparts. Finnish recipes, however, tend to favour fresh ingredients over canned or pickled foods, as fresh vegetables, fish, and meat are available throughout the year.

==Finnish food==
===Meats from Finland===

The most popular meats in Finland are pork (33.5 kg/year/person in 2005), beef (18.6 kg), and chicken (13.3 kg). Approximately one third of this is eaten as sausage (), which is mostly made from pork but often mixes in other meats as well. Horse meat, lamb and reindeer make up a small portion of the total meat consumption, but they are widely available.

In addition to domesticated animals, there are long traditions of hunting and fishing in Finland. The hunters focus on deer, moose and bear, but small game such as hare, duck and grouse are popular. Approximately 70,000–80,000 moose are culled yearly, producing significant amounts of meat. Due to very strict food hygiene regulations, moose meat is mainly consumed within households and is rarely obtainable in restaurants.

===Berries===
Arctic wild berries are distinctively featured in Finnish cuisine with their strong flavor and high nutrient content. Traditionally, they were eaten fresh in summer and dried at other times of year. It is still quite common to go picking berries straight from the forests – in fact, wild berries are free to pick in any forest, state or private, except in close proximity to dwellings (see freedom to roam). Wild raspberries (), bilberries () and lingonberries () are found in almost every part of Finland, while cloudberries (), cranberries (), arctic brambles () and sea buckthorns () grow in more limited areas. The intensely flavored wild strawberry () is a seasonal delicacy decorating cakes, served alone, with cream, or with ice cream. Farmed strawberry () is also very common.

Today, berries are no longer dried for winter consumption but usually frozen. They may be used as ingredients, or eaten on their own, for example, with porridge and sugar. Kiisseli (a sweet soup of berry juice and berries thickened with potato starch) is a common dessert. Homemade berry juices and jams are common, especially among older people. While berries are most often used for desserts, they are also served with meat, especially the sour lingonberry relish.

Bilberry &quot;kissel|kiisseli&quot; () and pie (), made from wild bilberries (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;), are traditional Finnish desserts. Bilberries are frequently used in Finnish cuisine, both as an ingredient, such as bilberry pie, and also served with cream or ice cream. They are often used on top of &quot;viili&quot; and other yogurt-type dishes.

=== Fish ===

Lakes and rivers in Finland and the Baltic Sea provide many opportunities for fishing and fish has always been an important protein source. Numerous methods of preparing fish are used, including frying, boiling, drying, salting, fermenting, cold smoking or simply slicing sea fish and eating it raw. Salmon is a popular choice, both as : cold smoked salmon, lox, or served raw with lemon juice as &quot;graavilohi&quot; ( in Swedish). The soup called &quot;lohikeitto&quot; is also one of the most popular salmon dishes in Finland. It is common to smoke any type of fish, like salmon, zander, pike, perch and Baltic herring. A popular dish among the Swedish-speaking population is smoked herring (, ). There are many styles of pickled herring which is a common appetizer and also served around Midsummer accompanied by small potatoes called ( in Swedish) which means &#x27;new potato&#x27;, usually the first harvests of potato. Whitefish and vendace roe are Finnish delicacies served on top of a toast or with blinis. Crayfish can be found in many lakes and streams in Finland and, in August especially, the Swedish-speaking population often arranges parties centered around eating crayfish and drinking.

=== Mushrooms ===

Various species of mushrooms grow in abundance in Finnish forests and false morels start the season in spring and are used in creamy dishes. Chanterelles and ceps pop up after Midsummer and are popular in the whole country, while in eastern Finland almost all edible fungi are consumed, including milkcaps and russulas. Most of the mushroom recipes originate from Russia, since Finns used mushrooms in coloring fabrics rather than as food. Mushrooms are used in soups, sauces, stews, pie fillings, or simply fried in a pan with onions as a side dish. They are preserved for the winter by pickling or drying. Chanterelles are frequently featured in Finnish haute cuisine with their relatives winter chanterelles which often end the season. Just like berry picking, mushroom hunting is also a popular outdoor activity among Finns.

=== Bread ===
Dark and fiber-rich &quot;ruisleipä&quot;, rye bread, is a staple of the Finnish diet. Breads are made from grains like barley, oat, rye and wheat, or by mixing different grits and flours. For example, is made of a combination of rye and wheat. There is also a variety of flat breads called , like &quot;maitorieska&quot; (milk flatbread), with barley grits from Savonia, (lard flatbread) a somewhat flat barley bread with pieces of lard from Western coast, and &quot;perunarieska&quot; (potato flatbread). In Kainuu, North Finland, the flatbreads are very flat and baked on naked flame. &quot;Näkkileipä&quot;, crisp rye bread, is also common. Famines caused by crop failures in the 19th century caused Finns to improvise or bark bread, bread made from rye flour and the soft phloem layer of pine bark, which was nutritious, but rock-hard and anything but tasty. It was eaten also during the Second World War, and the tradition of making this bread has had a minor come-back with claims of health benefits.

=== Porridges ===
The Finnish breakfast traditionally includes a substantial portion of porridge. Rolled oats, rye or multi-grain porridge are most common. However, there are other options such as the milk-based (semolina-milk porridge) and &quot;helmipuuro&quot; (starch grain-milk porridge). Porridges are often eaten with milk, sugar, butter or berry &quot;kiisseli&quot;. The Christmas season introduces milk-based rice porridge (), sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and often topped with prune (). There is also a semolina-based porridge flavored with fresh or frozen lingonberries called (&quot;beaten porridge&quot;).

=== Beverages ===

Water and coffee are the most common drinks in Finland, but during meals milk and sour milk (, a fermented milk) are popular too, even among adults. Coffee is often drunk several times a day and Finland has the highest per capita consumption of coffee in the world. Tea is also available in most homes. There are several types of home-brewed alcoholic beverages, such as &quot;sima&quot; (mead) and &quot;sahti&quot; (traditional beer). Spirits brands include Koskenkorva (vodka-like clear spirit) and a &quot;salmiakki&quot; flavored shot Salmiakkikossu, Jaloviina (cut brandy), Finlandia vodka, and Marskin ryyppy (Marshal Mannerheim&#x27;s shot). Around Christmas time a type of mulled wine called &quot;glögi&quot; is served, also often as a non-alcoholic version. Many berries are used to season liqueurs, e.g. cloudberry liqueur and there are fruit wines produced from red and black currants. A national specialty would be multiple brands of flavored hard ciders (as in Sweden) and long drink mixes with the pet name &quot;lonkero&quot;, which was originally a gin and grapefruit soda long drink.

The Finnish beer scene is dominated by pale lagers. Local brands with the highest market share include Koff, Lapin Kulta, Karjala, Olvi and Karhu and their taste is rather similar to the Danish counterparts like Carlsberg and Tuborg. Non-alcoholic beer has also become a popular alternative during recent years. (similar to Slavic kvass) is the traditional small beer. Kotikalja is a malty, sugar-containing sweet beer fermented only for carbonation, thus its alcohol content is low enough (&lt;1.2%) to be served as a soft drink. Hops are often absent.

== Examples of Finnish dishes ==
The term (&quot;traditional dish&quot;) is often applied to specialties that are rarely eaten on a daily basis. These are often regional, associated with the older generations or specific holidays—for example, &quot;mämmi&quot; on Easter—and most people eat these dishes rarely, or not at all.

== Meals ==
Common meals are breakfast (&quot;aamupala&quot;), lunch (&quot;lounas&quot;), dinner (&quot;päivällinen&quot;) and supper (&quot;iltapala&quot;). Sometimes there is also an afternoon snack (&quot;välipala&quot;) or a coffee break where a light snack is served. In all primary and secondary schools, including high school, a hot free lunch is served as part of Finland&#x27;s welfare state system. Lunch, eaten around noon, is usually a warm meal, although some people may select a lighter meal such as a sandwich or a salad. Taking a lunchbox is not as common as elsewhere in Europe. Universities also provide lunch for students, but contrary to primary and secondary schools, lunch in universities is not free of charge but subsidized.

Lunch typically consists of a single course with optional side salad, bread and dessert. Many workplaces have a lunch restaurant, and if not, employers often give lunch vouchers. Restaurants often have a separate lunch menu for this purpose. In the evening, the dinner is usually a hot meal, again with sides. Meals are usually single-course, commonly consisting of meat of some sort (pork, lamb, chicken, beef) and potatoes, rice or pasta with the meat. Soups, such as pea soup or fish soup, are not considered appetizers only, but may be served as lunch or dinner, and they are correspondingly heavier and come in larger portions.

Dinner is typically the most substantial meal of the day. However, it is served rather early at 5 pm, so that there is often a separate supper at 8-9 pm. This supper (&quot;iltapala&quot;) is a light snack.

=== Breakfast ===

Breakfast is seen as a substantial meal and usually consists of open sandwiches. The sandwich is often buttered, with savoury toppings such as hard cheese or cold cuts. Sour milk products such as yoghurt or &quot;viili&quot; are also common breakfast foods, usually served in a bowl with cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, and sometimes with sugar, fruit or jam. A third food that is commonly eaten at breakfast is porridge (), often made of rolled oats, and eaten with a pat of butter (, lit. &#x27;butter eye&#x27;) or with milk, or fruit or jam, especially the sort made of raspberries or strawberries (sometimes lingonberries). Drinks are milk, juice, tea, or coffee.

=== Coffee breaks ===
Finland has the highest coffee consumption per capita in the world, averaging of coffee per person annually. It is typical for a Finn to drink coffee continuously throughout the day, often accompanied by a sweet bun or a sandwich. Most workplaces allocate time for coffee breaks and serving coffee is very likely to happen to a visitor to a private home. Finns consider it as a small courtesy.

==Criticism==

In 2005, Finnish cuisine came under heavy fire from two leaders of countries renowned for their cuisine. The Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi claimed that &quot;I&#x27;ve been to Finland and I had to endure the Finnish diet so I am in a position to make a comparison.&quot; Berlusconi started his anti-Finnish food campaign in 2001. He went on: &quot;The Finns don&#x27;t even know what prosciutto is.&quot; This followed the initial decision by the European Commission to establish the European Food Safety Authority in Helsinki. On 4 July 2005 French President Jacques Chirac claimed that &quot;After Finland, [Britain is] the country with the worst food.&quot;

After Jacques Chirac&#x27;s and Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s critiques, some international food reporters answered:
&quot;Chirac and Berlusconi are wrong! Finnish cuisine is much more international than I expected. I have eaten very good food in wonderful restaurants, visited market places and enjoyed in good cafeterias. Cheese is very good in Finland. I also love Finnish cloudberry and smoked fish.&quot; (Ute Junker, &quot;Australian Financial Review Magazine&quot;, Sydney, Australia)

&quot;Food in Finnish restaurants is extremely good. Especially I love Finnish salmon, mushroom soup and desserts. I have also got very good Finnish wines. The worldwide reputation of Finnish cuisine isn&#x27;t very good – but it should be!&quot; (Liliane Delwasse, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Paris, France)

&quot;I have eaten only good food in Finland. Food in Finland is very fresh. Bread, berries, mushrooms and desserts are very delicious. Finnish berries (especially cloudberry), salmon, cheeses and reindeer should be available in London, too.&quot; (April Hutchinson, &quot;Abta Magazine&quot;, London, England).
Finnish pizza chain Kotipizza won the 2008 America&#x27;s Plate International pizza contest in New York, while Italian-American pizza came in second. They named their award-winning smoked reindeer pizza &quot;Berlusconi&quot; as symbolic payback for the critique Finnish cuisine had received from the Italian prime minister earlier.

<doc id="215430" wikidata="Q196287" url="?curid=215430" title="Mihajlo Pupin">
<text>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin (, ; October 4, 1858 – March 12, 1935), also known as Michael Pupin, was a Serbian-American electrical engineer, physicist and inventor.

Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as &quot;pupinization&quot;). Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on 3 March 1915, which later became NASA, and he participated in the founding of American Mathematical Society and American Physical Society.

In 1924, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his autobiography. Pupin was elected president or vice-president of the highest scientific and technical institutions, such as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Radio Institute of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an honorary consul of Serbia in the United States from 1912 to 1920 and played a role in determining the borders of newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

==Early life and education==

Mihajlo Pupin was an ethnic Serb, born on 4 October (22 September, O.S.) in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in the region of Banat, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire, 1858. He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, &quot;From Immigrant to Inventor&quot; (1923):

Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.

Because of his activity in the &quot;Serbian Youth&quot; movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the twenty-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.

==Studies in America and Ph.D.==

For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin&#x27;s predicted that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.

After Pupin completed his studies, with emphasis in the fields of physics and mathematics, he returned to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling supervised by John Tyndall at the University of Cambridge. He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz with a dissertation titled &quot;Osmotic Pressure and its Relation to Free Energy”.

== Professor at Columbia University ==
In 1889 Pupin returned to Columbia University, where he was offered a position as &quot;Teacher of Mathematical Physics in the Department of Electrical Engineering&quot;. Shortly afterwards he was appointed associate professor, and in 1901 professor of electromechanics. Pupin&#x27;s research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.

He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen&#x27;s discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on 2 January 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was &quot;too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour&quot; which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient&#x27;s hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if &quot;drawn with pen and ink.&quot; Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.

==Pupin coils==
Pupin&#x27;s 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called &quot;Pupin coils&quot;, followed closely on the pioneering work of the English polymath Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin&#x27;s patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), making him wealthy. Although AT&amp;T bought Pupin&#x27;s patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell&#x27;s own patent. AT&amp;T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long-distance telephones and especially submarine ones.

==World War I research==
When the United States joined the First World War in 1917, Pupin was working at Columbia University, organizing a research group for submarine detection techniques.
Together with his colleagues, professors Wils and Morcroft, he performed numerous experiments with the aim of discovering submarines at Key West and New London. He also conducted research in the field of establishing telecommunications between places. During the war, Pupin was a member of the state council for research and state advisory board for aeronautics. For his work he received acclamation from President Warren G. Harding, which was published on page 386 of his autobiography.

==Yugoslavia borders==
By World War I, Pupin was as well-known for Serbian nationalism as science. He wrote that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 &quot;was ... prepared in Vienna&quot; when Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina began in 1878. Pan-Serb ideology was, Pupin said, &quot;a natural heritage of every true Serb&quot;. As a politically influential figure in America, Pupin participated in the final decisions of the Paris peace conference after the war, when the borders of the future kingdom (of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians) were drawn. Pupin stayed in Paris for two months during the peace talk (April–May 1919) on the insistence of the government.

According to the London agreement from 1915. it was planned that Italy should get Dalmatia. After the secret London agreement France, England and Russia asked from Serbia some territorial concessions to Romania and Bulgaria. Romania should have gotten Banat and Bulgaria should have gotten a part of Macedonia all the way to Skoplje.

In a difficult situation during the negotiations on the borders of Yugoslavia, Pupin personally wrote a memorandum on 19 March 1919 to American president Woodrow Wilson, who, based on the data received from Pupin about the historical and ethnic characteristics of the border areas of Dalmatia, Slovenia, Istria, Banat, Međimurje, Baranja and Macedonia, stated that he did not recognize the London agreement signed between the allies and Italy.

==Mihajlo Pupin foundation==

In 1914, Pupin formed &quot;Fund Olimpijada Aleksić-Pupin&quot; within the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts to commemorate his mother Olimpijada for all the support she gave him through life. Fund assets were used for helping schools in old Serbia and Macedonia, and scholarships were awarded every year on the Saint Sava day. One street in Ohrid was named after Mihajlo Pupin in 1930 to honour his efforts. He also established a separate &quot;Mihajlo Pupin fund&quot; which he funded from his own property in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which he later gave to &quot;Privrednik&quot; for schooling of young people and for prizes in &quot;exceptional achievements in agriculture&quot;, as well as for Idvor for giving prizes to pupils and to help the church district.

Thanks to Pupin&#x27;s donations, the library in Idvor got a reading room, schooling of young people for agriculture sciences was founded, as well as the electrification and waterplant in Idvor. Pupin also donated over 500 publications to Belgrade University Library. His gifts included scientific books and subscriptions in preparation of the opening of the new building in 1926, and continued with numerous volumes from his private collection in 1932 and 1933. Pupin established a foundation in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. The funds of the foundation were used to purchase works of Serbian artists (including Uroš Predić, Paja Jovanović, Konstantin Danil, among others) for the museum, and for the printing of certain publications. Pupin invested a million dollars in the funds of the foundation.

In 1909, he established one of the oldest Serbian emigrant organizations in the United States called &quot;Union of Serbs – &quot;Sloga&quot;.&quot; The organization had a mission to gather Serbs in immigration and offer help, as well as keeping ethnic and cultural values. This organization later merged with three other immigrant societies.

Other emigrant organizations in to one large Serbian national foundation, and Pupin was one of its founders and a longtime president (1909–1926).

He also organized &quot;Kolo srpskih sestara&quot; (English: Circle of Serbian sisters) who gathered help for the Serbian Red Cross, and he also helped the gathering of volunteers to travel to Serbia during the First World War with the help of the Serbian patriotic organization called the &quot;Serbian National Defense Council&quot; which he founded and led. Later, at the start of the Second World War this organization was rehabilitated by Jovan Dučić and worked with the same goal. Pupin guaranteed the delivery of food supplies to Serbia with his own resources, and he also was the head of the committee that provided help to the victims of war. He also founded the Serbian society for helping children which provided medicine, clothes and shelter for war orphans.

Pupin and his wife were married for eight years; she died from pneumonia at the age of 37.

Pupin owned an estate and farm in Norfolk, Connecticut. He wrote about it as his &quot;real American home&quot;, because he &quot;never had a desire to seek a better haven of happiness in any other place&quot;.

Pupin had a reputation not only as a great scientist but also a fine person. He was known for his manners, great knowledge, love of his homeland and availability to everyone. Pupin was a great philanthropist and patron of the arts. He was a devoted Orthodox Christian and was the chief financial benefactor of St. Sava Monastery founded in 1923.

Mihajlo Pupin died in New York City in 1935 at age 76 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.

<text>The sone () is a unit of loudness, the subjective perception of sound pressure. The study of perceived loudness is included in the topic of psychoacoustics and employs methods of psychophysics. Doubling the perceived loudness doubles the sone value. Proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens in 1936, it is not an SI unit.

==Definition and conversions==
According to Stevens&#x27; definition, a loudness of 1 sone is equivalent to 40 phons (a 1 kHz tone at 40 dB SPL). The phons scale aligns with dB, not with loudness, so the sone and phon scales are not proportional. Rather, the loudness in sones is, at least very nearly, a power law function of the signal intensity, with an exponent of 0.3. With this exponent, each 10 phon increase (or 10 dB at 1 kHz) produces almost exactly a doubling of the loudness in sones.

At frequencies other than 1 kHz, the loudness level in phons is calibrated according to the frequency response of human hearing, via a set of equal-loudness contours, and then the loudness level in phons is mapped to loudness in sones via the same power law.

Loudness &quot;N&quot; in sones (for &quot;LN&quot; &gt; 40 phon):
:formula_1

or loudness level &quot;L&quot;N in phons (for &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1 sone):
:formula_2

Corrections are needed at lower levels, near the threshold of hearing.

These formulas are for single-frequency sine waves or narrowband signals. For multi-component or broadband signals, a more elaborate loudness model is required, accounting for critical bands.

To be fully precise, a measurement in sones must be specified in terms of the optional suffix G, which means that the loudness value is calculated from frequency groups, and by one of the two suffixes D (for direct field or free field) or R (for room field or diffuse field).

<text>The phon is a logarithmic unit of loudness level for tones and complex sounds. Loudness is measured in sones, a linear unit. Human sensitivity to sound is variable across different frequencies; therefore, although two different tones may present an identical sound pressure to a human ear, they may be psychoacoustically perceived as differing in loudness. The purpose of the phon is to provide a logarithmic measurement (like decibels) for perceived sound magnitude, while the primary loudness standard methods result in a linear representation. A sound with a loudness of 1 sone is judged equally loud as a 1 kHz tone with a sound pressure level of 40 decibels above 20 micropascals. The phon is psychophysically matched to a reference frequency of 1 kHz. In other words, the phon matches the sound pressure level (SPL) in decibels of a similarly perceived 1kHz pure tone. For instance, if a sound is perceived to be equal in intensity to a 1kHz tone with an SPL of 50dB, then it has a loudness of 50phons, regardless of its physical properties. The phon was proposed in DIN 45631 and ISO 532 B by Stanley Smith Stevens.

==Definition==

By definition, the loudness level in phons of a sound is the sound pressure level (in dB SPL) of a 1 kHz pure tone that is judged as having the same loudness. The phon unit is not an SI unit in metrology. It is defined as a unit of loudness level by the American National Standards Institute in the &quot;Acoustical Terminology&quot; standard ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013. Because the phon is a unit associated with a subjective percept, it is obtained by presenting the considered sound to a group of normal-hearing human listeners and by taking the median of the loudness levels they report.

Such measurements have been performed for known sounds, such as pure tones at different frequencies and levels. The equal-loudness contours are a way of mapping the dB SPL of a pure tone to the perceived loudness level in phons (see loudness for details).

<doc id="215461" wikidata="Q1079196" url="?curid=215461" title="Command (computing)">
<text>In computing, a command is a directive to a computer program to perform a specific task. It may be issued via a command-line interface or as input to a network service as part of a network protocol, or as an event triggered in a graphical user interface.

Specifically, the term &quot;command&quot; is used in imperative programming languages. The name arises because statements in these languages are usually written in a manner similar to the imperative mood used in many natural languages. A statement in an imperative programming language would then be a sentence in a natural language, and the command would be the predicate.

Many programs allow specifically formatted arguments, known as flags or options, which modify the default behaviour of the program, while further arguments may provide objects, such as files, to act on. As an analogy to a natural language, the flags are adverbs, while the other arguments are objects.

==Distinction between &quot;command&quot; and expression, statement and function== 
The meaning of &quot;command&quot; is highly dependent on context. For example, some authors refer to conditionals as commands while they are called &quot;expressions&quot; in Python or Bash and &quot;statements&quot; in Java.
Similarly, writing to stdout is done in Bash with the builtin &quot;command&quot; printf, while it is done with the built-in &quot;function&quot; print() in Python.

==Examples==
Here are some commands given to a command-line interpreter (Unix shell).

The following command changes the user&#x27;s working position in the directory tree to the directory &quot;/home/pete&quot;. The utility program is &quot;cd&quot; and the argument is &quot;/home/pete&quot;:
 cd /home/pete

The following command prints the text &quot;Hello World&quot; on the standard output stream, which, in this case, just prints the text on the screen. The program name is echo and the argument is &quot;Hello World&quot;. The quotes are used to prevent &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World&quot; being treated as separate tokens:
 echo &quot;Hello World&quot;

The following commands are equivalent. They list files in the directory &quot;/bin&quot;. The program is &quot;ls&quot;, having three flags (&quot;l&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;), and the argument is the directory &quot;/bin&quot;:
 ls -l -t -r /bin
 ls -ltr /bin

The following command displays the contents of the files &quot;ch1.txt&quot; and &quot;ch2.txt&quot;. The program name is &quot;cat&quot;, having two file name arguments:
 cat ch1.txt ch2.txt

Here are some commands for the DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows command prompt processor. The following command displays the contents of the file &quot;readme.txt&quot;. The program name is &quot;type&quot; and the argument is &quot;readme.txt&quot;.
 type readme.txt

The following command lists the contents of the current directory. The program name is &quot;dir&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; is a flag requesting that the owner of each file also be listed.
 dir /Q

<text>Doshin the Giant is a god simulation game developed by Param and published by RandnetDD for the 64DD. It was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1999, as a launch title for the peripheral. A soundtrack by Tatsuhiko Asano was released on CD by Media Factory, early the next year. Both of these received positive reviews. An expansion pack was released five months later called &quot;Kyojin no Doshin Kaihō Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishūgou&quot;, which takes a very different perspective of the game, featuring short animated clips that the player can unlock after playing the original game. &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; was upgraded graphically for its re-release on the GameCube in Japan on March 14, 2002, and Europe on September 20, 2002. The GameCube version was published by Nintendo and received positive reviews.

==Gameplay==
As a god game, &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot;″s gameplay revolves around god-like abilities and tasks, such as altering the geography, managing natural disasters or answering prayers from simulated worshippers. Its designer Kazutoshi Iida has described it as &quot;&quot;Populous&quot; meets &quot;Mario&quot;&quot;.

The player controls the Doshin as he tries to help or hinder the island&#x27;s inhabitants. Doing so causes the villagers to release love or hate, which Doshin absorbs. The two feelings cancel each other out, but if he gets enough of one type, he will grow in size. Doshin is the Love Giant, a yellow, featureless giant with a happy face and a few strands of hair. He is a benevolent being whose helpful actions earn love from his people and cause his body to increase in size for a day and return to normal size the next day. He can pick up objects such as people and trees. Doshin can transform at will into his evil alter ego Jashin, the Hate Giant. In the GameCube version, he has wings and clawed feet and inspires Hate monuments that are slightly different from the Love monuments Doshin can earn. Jashin is known to be a destructive force to the natives, the opposite of Doshin&#x27;s nature. With his bad actions, people show him their dislike, and he increases in size. The only thing the two giants have in common is that both have an outie belly button. Although he cannot pick up things, he can send streams of fire across the land, destroying structures in their way. Doshin and Jashin can both raise and lower terrain.

The four native tribes on the island are separated with the color of their clothing (red, green, yellow, blue). The female natives are dressed in a sleeveless, uni-colored gown of their tribe&#x27;s color. The male natives wear a kilt and hat of their tribe&#x27;s color, but remain shirtless, also showing outie belly buttons. In the GameCube version the people also raise farm animals, and there are fish in the water. There are several threats that also endanger the villagers, such as tornadoes, volcanoes, fires, being crushed by Doshin, and even jealous tribe members named &quot;Naughties&quot;.

An album stores photographic snapshots of the gameplay itself, and the player can examine a monument gallery closely for more information. In the GameCube version, completing the game unlocks a &quot;New Map&quot; option with various islands and various themed layouts and textures.

Developer Kazutoshi Iida notes &quot;the sheer simplicity of the user-interface, as the game can be played without numbers or letters&quot;. He added, &quot;Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto from Nintendo has said that computer games incorporate a world-wide common language, and &quot;Doshin&quot; illustrates this very clearly.&quot;

==Story==
The game opens on an island called Barudo, with a spoken narration, by an island native. This man, named Sodoru, who wears a mask on his face, tells the legend of a giant that rises out of the sea as the morning sun rises. As he tells the player this, a yellow giant named Doshin appears from out of the water.

The player then takes control of the giant. Sodoru then tells the player what the other inhabitants of the island want such as trees or hills raised and lowered. He then suggests helping the people, for which they will reward the giant with love, and might build a monument to it. Sodoru then suggests that the giant help bring the four tribes together. It takes Doshin many days to do this, and at the end of each day as the sun sets he returns to the sea. Finally, when every possible combination of tribes has been reached, the islanders then build one final monument called the Tower of Babel, which causes the island and Doshin to sink into the sea, thus killing everyone. However, the next day, a new island appears at sunrise in the shape of Doshin himself, with two members of each of the tribes on it as before. Doshin then walks out onto the island again and the story continues. The GameCube version has an additional portion after this ending, with new islanders building a large rocket that blasts them up into space.

==Developer==

Param was a Japanese video game development company that worked in partnership with Nintendo to develop &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; and its expansion. The company was headed up by Takao Kurebayashi, Kazutoshi Iida and Yana. Param was a part of Marigul Management. Param was defunct as Marigul was liquidated in May 2003.

Kazutoshi Iida, a graduate of Tama Art University born in 1968, founded Param in 1997. Before Param, Iida lead development of &quot;Tail of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Aquanaut&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. Iida moved on to a company called Umigame Bunko, translated as Sea Turtle Library, and worked with Marvelous Entertainment on &quot;Discipline&quot; for WiiWare. Iida became a professor of Film at Ritsumeikan University.

==Reception and sales==
&quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; was first publicly displayed at Nintendo&#x27;s Space World &#x27;99 trade show on August 27–29, 1999. Developer Kazutoshi Iida recalled a &quot;continuous line of people queued to use the eight playable test units, and the &#x27;Large Screen Experience&#x27;&quot;. He said that the foreign press received the game &quot;very enthusiastically&quot;.

&quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; was a hit game in Japan, peaking at #1 and becoming the ninth best-selling game of 2002. In the UK, it peaked at #9 and is the 65th best-selling game (and 22nd best-selling GameCube game) of 2002 and hit the top of the GameCube charts. Doshin went on to appear as a trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, holding a villager in his hands; Jashin appears as a secret trophy in the lottery as Hate Giant.

Drew Mackie of the &quot;Singing Mountain&quot; podcast noted the game for its &quot;trippy tropicalia&quot; soundtrack and said it was &quot;worth a second look&quot;.

==&quot;Kyojin no Doshin: Kaihō Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishūgō&quot;==
Kyojin no Doshin Kaihō Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishūgō is a 64DD expansion to the original, released on June 30, 2000. It requires the &quot;Doshin the Giant&quot; disk to operate.

===Gameplay===
For the first time started, the game will ask for Doshin 1 disk to modify the game the way, that each of its events will be logged if encountered.
In the game, a child is told to go to sleep and is pulled out of bed and through the window, into a world of dreams. There, Doshin is now imprisoned, and the child can tinkle 2D hearts on people and the giant. The main objective of the game is to watch the 17 mini black and white movies collectively titled &quot;More Than Giant&quot;. The player must repeatedly go back and forth between the two disks to verify that monuments were built in game 1, and to complete tasks that the &quot;Queen Companions&quot; request of them.

Another objective is to free Doshin from his imprisonment, by causing him to grow larger than his cage. This will cause the game credits to begin.

The player can also gather help to free Doshin. After creating monuments in &quot;Doshin 1&quot; and their counterpart pavilions, children will appear in the Expo area. The player can tinkle on them with their hearts, and they will join the player&#x27;s team, becoming &quot;Teamers&quot; or teamsters. There are two other teams that the player can choose from at the start of the game. When enough pavilions are completed the player can battle the other teamster groups in a tinkle contest. If the player wins, the loser&#x27;s team members become neutral and can be added to their team. The team can be made of up to six other children. This gives the player six times more tinkling hearts that can be poured onto Doshin to try and free him.

The player is given a meter for love which they can use on the other people, billboards, or Doshin. However, if the heart becomes too full, or the player is beaten at a tinkle contest, it causes the player to wake up. After Doshin is released, he will start destroying the entire place, then flooding it with yellow from the belly button which finds out to be a plug, then the player&#x27;s character wakes up to find that they now have a stained blanket, which the mother lectures the child about. At this moment Doshin appears from behind the blanket, and part of the child jumps into dreamland, as a Queen Companion appears asking if the player wants to play again. From that point the credits begin as the live-action FMV of camera descending down a pipe plays.

===Reception===
Peer Schneider of IGN rated the game at 2.5 out of 10, citing the graphics, controls, and gameplay. He said it &quot;[l]ooks and plays like it was programmed in two weeks. Controls are bad&quot; and &quot;this add-on disk is a glorified movie player.&quot; The only thing he found appealing about the game was its presentation, saying that &quot;[t]he Param team definitely has a sense of humor. Both &quot;Doshin&quot; games will make you laugh because they&#x27;re so absurd.&quot; He ended his review of the game with one word: &quot;Painful&quot;.

<doc id="215468" wikidata="Q2358894" url="?curid=215468" title="Former administrative divisions of Romania">
<text>The 41 [[județ]]e () and the municipality of Bucharest comprise the official administrative divisions of Romania. They also represent the European Union&#x27; s NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania.

==Overview==
The earliest organization into &quot;județe&quot; of the Principalities of Wallachia, respectively &quot;ținuturi&quot; of Moldavia, dates back at least to the late 14th century. Each &quot;județ&quot;, respectively &quot;ținut&quot;, was ruled by a &quot;jude&quot;, respectively &quot;pârcălab&quot;, an officially appointed person who had administrative and judicial functions in a manner inspired from the organization of the late Byzantine Empire. Transylvania, when it was part of the historic Kingdom of Hungary (in the Middle Ages), an independent Principality or a Habsburg domain (in the modern era until World War I) was divided into royal counties (Latin: &quot;comitatus&quot;), headed by &quot;comes&quot; (royal counts) with administrative and judicial functions. The term &quot;județ&quot; started to be used in Romanian as a general term for all administrative divisions since the mid 19th century.

When modern Romania was formed in 1859 through the union of Wallachia and rump Moldavia, and then extended in 1918 through the union of Transylvania, as well as Bukovina and Bessarabia (parts of Moldavia temporarily acquired by respectively the Habsburgs, 1775–1918, and the Russian Tsars, 1812–1917), the administrative division was modernized using the French departments system as model. With the exception of the Communist period, this system remained in place. A &quot;prefect&quot; (from the Latin &quot;praefectus&quot;) is appointed for each &quot;județ&quot;. The prefect is the representative of the government in the county and the head of the local administration in the areas not devolved to local authorities. Until 1950, each &quot;județ&quot; was divided into a number of &quot;plăși&quot; (singular &quot;plasă&quot;), each administered by a &quot;pretor&quot; (from the Latin &quot;praetor&quot;), appointed by the &quot;prefect&quot;. Currently, Romania has no NUTS-4 units, the counties being composed directly of cities (with or without municipality status) and communes.

As in all modern democracies, the political power in Romania is divided into three independent branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The &quot;prefect&quot; and his administration have only executive prerogatives. However, the territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication. At the same time with local elections (of mayors and councilors for the cities and communes), a County Council (&quot;consiliu județean&quot;) is directly elected for each county, and, since 2008, the President of the County Council is also elected by direct vote. As of now, the legislative powers of county councils are quite reduced, but there are plans for more decentralization. (These plans, however, call for introduction of Regional Councils for the 8 development regions of the NUTS-2 level.)

==Before World War I==
As of 1872, Romania was organized into 33 counties of which 17 were in Wallachia (12 in Muntenia and 5 in Oltenia), and 16 were in Moldavia (13 in western Moldavia and 3 in Southern Bessarabia: Cahul County, Bolgrad County, Ismail County).

After Independence, Romania lost Southern Bessarabia and received Northern Dobruja. The Romanian Old Kingdom was divided into 32 counties, with the following seats:
* Argeș County – Pitești
* Bacău County – Bacău
* Botoșani County – Botoșani
* Brăila County – Brăila
* Buzău County – Buzău
* Constanța County – Constanța
** Silistra Nouă County (1878–1879, merged into Constanța County) – Rasova/Cernavodă/Medgidia
* Covurlui County – Galați
* Dâmbovița County – Târgoviște
* Dolj County – Craiova
* Dorohoi County – Dorohoi
* Fălciu County – Huși
* Gorj County – Târgu Jiu
* Ialomița County – Călărași
* Iași County – Iași
* Ilfov County – București
* Mehedinți County – Turnu Severin
* Muscel County – Câmpulung
* Neamț County – Piatra Neamț
* Olt County – Slatina
* Prahova County – Ploiești
* Putna County – Focșani
* Râmnicu Sărat County – Râmnicu Sărat
* Roman County – Roman
* Romanați County – Caracal
* Suceava County – Fălticeni
* Tecuci County – Tecuci
* Teleorman County – Turnu Măgurele
* Tulcea County – Tulcea
* Tutova County – Bârlad
* Vaslui County – Vaslui
* Vâlcea County – Râmnicu Vâlcea
* Vlașca County – Giurgiu


After the Second Balkan War, Romania was awarded the southern part of Dobrudja, between the Danube, Beli Lom River, Kamchiya River, and the Black Sea, which was divided into two counties:
* Durostor County – Silistra
* Caliacra County – Bazargic

==Interwar Romania==

Between 1919 and 1925 the specifics of the administrative organization in the new territories were kept. It consisted of about 76 counties or parts of counties. In 1923 Romania adopted a new Constitution, and it unified the traditional administrative systems of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia with that of the Romanian Old Kingdom. County borders were kept largely intact, with only a couple minor adjustments. As a result of the 1925 administrative unification law, the territory was divided into 71 counties, 489 districts (&quot;plăși&quot;) and 8,879 communes.

Some of the 71 &quot;județe&quot; still exist today, a number were lost during World War II, and some became defunct. The latter ones are:
* Baia Countydivided between Neamț, Suceava and Iași
* Caraș Countymerged with Severin to form Caraș-Severin
* Câmpulung Countymerged with Suceava
* Ciuc Countymerged with Odorhei and renamed to Harghita
* Covurlui Countymerged into Galați

* Trei Scaune Countyrenamed to Covasna
* Turda Countydivided between Cluj and Alba
* Tutova Countymerged with Vaslui
* Vlașca Countyrenamed to Giurgiu

=== Ținuturi: 1938–1940 ===
As a part of King Carol II&#x27;s administrative reform of August 14, 1938, 10 regions (&quot;ținuturi&quot;) were created, which each included several of the existing 71 counties. The counties were preserved as administrative units, but most of their responsibilities were transferred to the new regions. Each region was headed by a regional governor (&quot;Rezident Regal&quot;), who supervised the county prefects, and each region had a regional council. The regional governor was appointed directly by the King.
The aim of the new regions was to connect poorer and richer counties and to break up the historical regions (Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transylvania etc.). However, the old regionalisms continued under the new brand (e.g. Transylvanian regionalism in Ținutul Mureș and Bukovinian regionalism in Ținutul Suceava).
The new regions were short-lived: all regions but Ținutul Olt and Ținutul Timiș had lost territory in September 1940, following the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the USSR, the Second Vienna Award and the Treaty of Craiova. After the fall of Carol II&#x27;s personal regime (the so-called royal dictatorship) on September 6, 1940, the Ținuturi Timiș, Mureș, Mării, Dunărea de Jos, Prut and Suceava were restructured on September 16, 1940. All the regions were abolished only a couple of days later, on September 22, 1940.&lt;br&gt;
According to the Official Journal of August 14, 1938, the 10 regions and their capitals were the following:

Several regions had been given other names in the draft version of the Law (mentioned between brackets). All regions were named after rivers, except Ținutul Mării, i.e. the (Black) Sea Region, and Ținutul Bucegi, called after the Bucegi Mountains.

== World War II changes==
===Bessarabia===
After the recovery of Bessarabia, the Bessarabia Governorate with capital at Chișinău was established in 1941 and existed until 1944. It included the counties of Bălți, Cetatea Albă, Cahul, Chilia (newly established), Ismail, Lăpușna, Orhei, Soroca and Tighina.

===Bukovina===
Following the recapture of Northern Bukovina, the Bukovina Governorate with capital at Cernăuți (Chernivtsi) existed from 1941 to 1944. It included the counties of Câmpulung, Cernăuți, Dorohoi, Hotin, Rădăuți, Storojineț and Suceava.

===Administration of Transnistria (1941–1944)===

This territory was administered by Romania briefly in 1941–1944, when the country was governed by a military dictatorship allied with Nazi Germany. It consisted of formerly proper Soviet territory between Dniester and Southern Bug rivers. Nowadays, most of it is in Ukraine, with small parts in the Republic of Moldova (Transnistria). This territory was kept under Romanian military occupation, and was not annexed by Romania. It was divided into 13 counties:
===Lost during and after the war===
;To Bulgaria
In 1913, as a result of the Second Balkan War, Romania acquired Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria, annexing this historical region within Romania&#x27;s borders. In 1940, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy forced Romania to return it to Bulgaria (&quot;see Treaty of Craiova&quot;). Romania did not reclaim this area neither after the end of World War II nor at the fall of communism. 
* Caliacra (now Dobrich Province, Bulgaria)
* Durostor (now Silistra Province, Bulgaria)

;To the Soviet Union
In 1940, Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region (the latter part of Dorohoi County in a rump Moldavia). Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, these territories have been part of the newly independent Moldova and Ukraine.

==Communist Romania==
===People&#x27;s Republic of Romania===

In 1951, the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party changed the administrative division of Romania to the Soviet model (regions and raions), but reverted to the county system in 1968, although county borders were quite different from the interwar period. A small adjustment was performed in 1981: former counties of Ilfov and Ialomița were reorganized into the present-day counties of Giurgiu, Călărași, Ialomița and Ilfov.

A new law on the administrative division from September 6, 1950, abolished the 58 remaining counties (as well as the 424 &quot;plăși&quot; and the 6,276 urban and rural communes), replacing them with 28 regions composed of 177 raions, 148 cities and 4,052 communes. In 1952 the number of regions was reduced to 18: Arad, Bacău, Baia Mare, Bârlad, București, Cluj, Constanța, Craiova, Galați, Hunedoara, Iași, Oradea, Pitești, Ploiești, Stalin, Suceava, Timișoara, and for the first time and autonomous administrative unit based on ethnic criteria, Magyar Autonomous Region (&quot;Regiunea Autonomă Maghiară&quot;). In 1956 the regions of Arad and Bârlad were also dismantled. In 1960, the Hungarian autonomous unit was renamed to &quot;Regiunea Mureș-Autonomă Maghiară&quot; (Mureș-Hungarian Autonomous Region) along with changes in its territory. The final number of regions was 16.



===Socialist Republic of Romania===
In February 1968, the old administrative division of &quot;județ&quot; was reinstated. On January 14, 1968, the law proposal included 35 counties. The final result was substantially different from the situation existent before 1950. This included 39 counties, municipality of Bucharest, 236 cities, out of which 47 were municipalities, and 2706 communes comprising 13149 villages. There were several reasons for restoring the &quot;județe&quot;. For one, the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime wished to distance itself from the Soviet Union, and discarding the Soviet administrative model was a means of achieving that. For another, the regime had a nationalist outlook, and bringing back an old Romanian system fit with the prevailing ideology. Finally, during his first years, Ceaușescu was preoccupied with replacing functionaries named by his predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and creating his own power base; dismissing the regional administrations and naming his own county officials was a step in that process.



==Current situation==

In 1981 the Ilfov County was divided into a so-called &quot;Agricultural Sector&quot; of Ilfov (&quot;Sectorul Agricol Ilfov&quot;) and the newly created Giurgiu County, and Călărași County was created by detaching the southern part of the Ialomița County. The county borders introduced in 1968 are largely in place at present, but administrative reforms during the 1990s have devolved the functions of different authorities in line with transition from a totalitarian communist system to a modern democracy. The only territorial adjustment after 1989 occurred in 1995, when Ilfov County was formed out of the so-called &quot;agricultural sector&quot; of the Municipality of Bucharest (&quot;Sectorul Agricol Ilfov&quot;). With Romania&#x27;s integration into the European structures, its counties became NUTS level 3 divisions of the European Union. Currently, Romania is divided into 41 counties and the Municipality of Bucharest.

==Future developments==

As of 2010–2011 there have been several proposals for the administrative reorganization of Romania made by the presidential commission tasked with the analysis of the current political and constitutional system. Most of these recommendations aim for the partial reestablishment of the counties in their pre-1950 form (NUTS III level). If this reform were adopted, the counties would be grouped into several regions (9 to 15) based on common historical and economic characteristics (NUTS II level). The regions will be in their turn clustered into 4–6 macroregions (NUTS I level). Furthermore, a NUTS IV level division, called &quot;plasă&quot; or &quot;canton&quot;, would probably be added in order to meet the EU statistical and administrative requirements.

Another proposal, based on 15 autonomous euro-regions (amongst them one ethnic-based region with a consistent Hungarian majority consisting of the existing Mureș, Harghita and Covasna counties) grouped into 5 statistical macroregions (NUTS I), was made by the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania.

In 2018, a name referendum was held in the Olt County to rename it to &quot;Olt-Romanați County&quot; in memory of the former Romanați County, but it did not reach the required turnout and therefore failed.

<doc id="215478" wikidata="Q1450795" url="?curid=215478" title="Singulative number">
<text>In linguistics, singulative number and collective number (abbreviated and ) are terms used when the grammatical number for multiple items is the unmarked form of a noun, and the noun is specially marked to indicate a single item.

This is the opposite of the more common singular–plural pattern, where a noun is unmarked when 
it represents one item, and is marked to represent more than one item.

In some cases, a further distinction is made between the collective and what is known in some terminologies as the plurative, the former referencing multiple items as a class, the latter referencing them as individual units.

Greenberg&#x27;s linguistic universal #35 states that no language is purely singulative-collective in the sense that plural is always the null morpheme and singular is not.

== Examples ==
===Welsh===
Welsh has two systems of grammatical number, singular–plural and collective–singulative. Since the loss of the noun inflection system of earlier Celtic, plurals have become unpredictable and can be formed in several ways: by adding a suffix to the end of the word (most commonly ), as in &quot;father&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot;, through vowel affection, as in &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;boys&quot;, or through a combination of the two, as in &quot;sister&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;. Other nouns take the singulative suffixes (for masculine nouns) or (for feminine nouns). Most nouns which inflect according to this system designate objects that are frequently found in groups, for example &quot;birds/flock of birds&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;; &quot;a bed of strawberries&quot;, &quot;a strawberry&quot;; &quot;children&quot;, &quot;a child&quot;; and &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;a tree&quot;. Still other nouns use suffixes for both singular and plural forms (e.g. &quot;a pony&quot;, &quot;ponies&quot;, the unsuffixed * does not exist); these are similar to nouns formed from other categories of words (e.g. &quot;charity&quot; gives rise to &quot;a beggar&quot; and &quot;beggars&quot;).

When translating the Welsh collective noun into English the plural is usually used, e.g. → &#x27;strawberries&#x27;. However, the Welsh collective also has a sense of a homogenous whole which the English plural cannot convey; compare the English &#x27;foliage&#x27; vs. &#x27;leaves&#x27;.

===Other languages===
Singulatives are featured in some Semitic and Slavic languages.

In Arabic grammar, the singulative is called , &quot;noun of unity&quot;. It is formed by the suffixes:
# -&quot;a(t)&quot;, applies to animals, plants, and inanimate objects
# -&quot;ī&quot;, applies to sentient beings



In some cases, the singulative has a further plural indicating a collection of the singular units, which may be broken or regular.

In East Slavic languages, which are basically of singular–plural system, the singular suffix -ин- (&#x27;-in-&#x27;, Russian, &#x27;-yn-&#x27;, Ukrainian), resp. &#x27;-ін-&#x27; (&#x27;-in-&#x27;, Belarusian) performs the singulative function for collective nouns.

Notice the affix &#x27;-a&#x27; in all these examples, which indicates the feminine form. Notice also that plural forms may be derived from these singulatives in a regular way: &quot;goroshina&quot;-&gt;&quot;goroshiny&quot; (several peas), etc.

In both East Slavic and Arabic, the singulative form always takes on the feminine gender. 

Singulative markers are found throughout the Nilo-Saharan languages. Majang, for example, has:
In Dutch, singulative forms of collective nouns are occasionally made by diminutives:

These singulatives can be pluralized like most other nouns: &quot;snoepjes&quot; &quot;several sweets, pieces of candy&quot;.

== Comparison with mass nouns ==
A collective form such as the Welsh , &quot;pigs&quot;, is more basic than the singular form , &quot;a pig&quot;. It is generally the collective form which is used as an adjectival modifier, e.g. (&quot;pig meat&quot;, &quot;pork&quot;). The collective form is therefore similar in many respects to an English mass noun such as &quot;rice&quot;, which in fact refers to a collection of items which are logically countable. However, English has no productive process of forming singulative nouns (just phrases such as &quot;a grain of rice&quot;). Therefore, English cannot be said to have singulative number.

== Plurative ==
In some cases, in addition to the collective and singulative forms, a third form, called the &quot;plurative&quot; in the terminology of some scholars, is distinguished from the collective. The collective form, in these cases, denotes multiple items as a class while the plurative denotes them as individuals. Compare, for example, &quot;people&quot; in &quot;People are funny&quot; with &quot;people&quot; in &quot;the people in this room&quot;, though in English the same plural form is used for both purposes.

Example: In Arabic, for &quot;samak&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;:

* &quot;samak&quot;, collective form, fish in general
* &quot;samak-a(t)&quot;, &quot;samak-e,&quot; singulative, a single fish
* &quot;ʔasmaak&quot;, plurative, as in &quot;many fish&quot; or &quot;three fish&quot;

<text>Sir Abdul Muhsin al-Sa‘doun, KCMG (; 1879 – 13 November 1929) was an Iraqi politician who served as Prime Minister of Iraq on four occasions between 1922 and 1929.

==Background and early career==
Abd al-Muhsin al-Sa&#x27;doun hailed from a family descended from the Sa&#x27;douns, the most powerful tribe within the Muntafiq Confederation. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire fostered rivalries between the dominant Sa&#x27;dun chiefs by offering enticing land deals to the highest bidders among them, pursuant to a policy of tribal weakening and division. In 1871 Midhat Pasha finally split the chiefs in two between &quot;Ottomanizers&quot; and their opponents by offering some chiefs permanent ownership of once communal tribal lands, when, previously, they could only exact tribute from farmers. The tribal chiefs then grew very wealthy by converting the rest of the tribe into tenant farmers for their exploitation.

When the United Kingdom took Iraq from the Ottomans following World War I, it pursued a policy whereby it lavished political and economic favours on tribal leaders in order to encourage them to exert their influence in ways conducive to British economic designs in the country. Al-Sa&#x27;doun was one of many to consistently obtain seats in Parliament in exchange for this service. Notably, however, while many tribal leaders at the time were provincial in outlook, al-Sa&#x27;doun was distinguished by being a sayyid (a descent from the Prophet Muhammad), and by having broadened his horizons at the Military Academy in Istanbul. Al-Sa&#x27;doun served as a military officer during Ottoman control of the country, as an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid II, and as a ten-year member of the Ottoman Parliament. Afterward, he returned to Iraq and embarked on a career as an influential politician.

==Time in Parliament==

Al-Sa&#x27;dun was a shrewd politician with many tribal and British connections, as demonstrated by his control over the Parliamentary alliance known as the Progressives. This made him one of King Faisal&#x27;s most bitter rivals, as he frequently acted as an instrument of British supremacy over the Iraqi interests Faisal was trying to pursue. In 1923, he suppressed a Shi&#x27;a movement calling for election boycotts. He was President of the Constituent Assembly in 1924. Then, in 1926, he assured the application of the unequal twenty-five-year &quot;Financial and Military Agreement&quot; between Iraq and Britain in spite of its unpopularity.

He was elected as the president of the Chamber of Deputies from 1926 to 1928 and in 1929.

During his third term as prime minister, al-Sa&#x27;doun also negotiated the Treaty of Ankara in which Iraq promised to pay Turkey 10% of its revenues from the Mosul oil fields in return for Turkish recognition of Iraqi control of the area. By December 1928, popular protest over British domination of Iraq had become more fervid, and al-Sa&#x27;doun began to support King Faisal&#x27;s demands for more autonomy. He resigned in protest in January 1929.

==Death==
On 13 November 1929, during his fourth term in office, al-Sa&#x27;doun died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His actions were considered to be a consequence of the criticism he had received from the Iraqi population and, subsequently, the British and international community for his &quot;disloyalty&quot;. He left behind a letter to his son stating, &quot;I have suffered with forbearance all possible insults and contempt&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In his memory, the street where he was died became known officially as &quot;al-Sa&#x27;doun Street&quot; and a bronze statue dedicated to him was built in the street.

<text>Hiawatha ( , : ), also known as Ayenwatha or Aiionwatha, was a precolonial Native American leader and cofounder of the Iroquois Confederacy. He was a leader of the Onondaga people, the Mohawk people, or both. According to some accounts, he was born an Onondaga but adopted into the Mohawks.

==Legend==
Although Hiawatha was a real person, he was mostly known through his legend. The events in the legend have been dated to the middle 1100s through the occurrence of an eclipse coincident with the founding of the Iroquois Confederacy. This material and quotations are taken from the Mohawk version of the legend, as related by the prominent chief Seth New house (Dayodekane). For an Onondaga version of the legend, see Parker: &quot;The Hiawatha Tradition&quot;.

When the founder of the Confederacy, Dekanawidah, known as The Great Peacemaker, first came to Iroquoia, one of the first people he met was Hiawatha, not yet called by that name. At that time, Hiawatha was a wild man and a cannibal, known as &quot;the man who eats humans.&quot; When Dekanawidah came to his cabin, he climbed onto the roof, looked down through the smoke hole, where there was a large kettle of water for cooking a meal of human flesh. When Hiawatha came home, he looked into the water and saw Dekanawidah&#x27;s face reflected back to him, which he thought was his own. &quot;In that face he was aware of a beauty, a wisdom and strength, which at first filled him with astonishment and then with shame, for it was not the face of one who killed and ate his fellow men.&quot; Dekanawidah came down, sat across the fire from him, and passed on to him the Great Law of Peace. Hiawatha accepted the message, and agreed to stay and work with his own people while Dekanawidah went on to pass the message to other nations.

The principal chief of the Onondaga at that time was a cruel tyrant called Tadodaho, or Atotarho. Tadodaho is described as twisted in both body and mind. &quot;His hair was filled with living snakes. Snakes&#x27; eyes looked out from his finger ends.&quot; Dekanawidah charged Hiawatha with converting Tadodaho—to &quot;comb the snakes out of [Tadodaho&#x27;s] hair.&quot; He gave him the name Hiawatha, which means &quot;he who combs.&quot;

After Dekanawidah left, Hiawatha presented his proposals to the Onondaga in councils, but Tadodaho kept frustrating all his efforts and disrupting the councils. It was claimed he has caused the death of Hiawatha&#x27;s three daughters and his wife by magic. Grief-stricken, Hiawatha left his village and wandered, &quot;stringing wampum and seeking someone who should understand the thirteen-string ceremony of condolence and take away his grief by the spell of the wampum.&quot; Finally, he came to the territory of the Mohawk, where Dekanawidah had converted the entire nation. Dekanawidah chanted the words that have since been part of the Iroquois Requickening Ceremony: &quot;I wipe away tears from thy face, using the white fawn-skin of pity ... I make it daylight for thee ... I beautify the sky. Now shall thou do thy thinking in peace ...&quot;. Afterwards, Hiawatha joined Dekanawidah in composing the laws of the Great Peace, and the Peace Hymn.

Then Hiawatha and Dekanawidah, together with the Mohawk chiefs, visited each of the other four Nations. They had no trouble with the Oneidas and the Cayugas, but the Senecas were divided against themselves and the Onondagas were afraid of the power of Tadodaho. A solar eclipse helped convince the Senecas, and the Onondagas were brought in by the power of the other four Nations and by the offer to Tadodaho that he become principal chief. &quot;In the end the mind of [Tadodaho] was made straight, the crooks were taken out of his body, and Hiawatha combed the snakes out of his hair.&quot;

Hiawatha was noted for his speaking skills and message of peace. Dekanawidah, a Huron prophet and spiritual leader, proposed the unification of the Iroquois peoples who shared common ancestry and similar languages, but he suffered from a severe speech impediment which hindered him from spreading his proposal. Hiawatha was a skilled orator, and he was instrumental in persuading the Five Nations to accept the Great Peacemaker&#x27;s vision and band together to become members of the Iroquois confederacy. The Tuscarora joined the Confederacy in 1722 to become the Sixth Nation. Little else is known of Hiawatha. The reason and time of his death is unknown; however, his legacy is still passed on from generation to generation through oral stories, songs, and books.

== The Iroquois Confederacy ==
Within the Iroquois Confederacy, which originally included five tribes (Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca), Hiawatha was a leader from the Mohawk tribe. There, he was well known and highly thought of by all of the tribes. He was a great speaker, and would eventually become the representative for the Great Peacemaker. The Great Peacemaker was a man who hoped to spread peace throughout all of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Territory. Due to the fact that he had a severe speech impediment, the Great Peacemaker needed a spokesperson. Hiawatha was willing to speak on behalf of Dekanawidah because violence had been developing throughout the Iroquois Territory. During these times of chaos, a leader named Tadodaho, who had despised the idea of peace, targeted and killed Hiawatha&#x27;s wife and daughters. Thereafter, Hiawatha became the Peacemaker&#x27;s speaker, so he could stop the violence. Dekanawidah and Hiawatha eventually obtained peace throughout the Iroquois by promising Tadodaho that Onondaga would become the capital of the Grand Council, the main governing body of the Iroquois. Hiawatha and Dekanawidah created the Great Law of Peace, recorded in wampum belts, to solidify the bond between the original five nations of the Iroquois.

Among the names of the fifty traditional Hoyenah (sachems) of the Haudenosaunee, Hiawatha (among others) is a representative of the Mohawk, and Tadodaho of the Onondaga.

== Hiawatha Belt ==

The Hiawatha Belt is a wampum belt that symbolizes peace between the original five nations of the Iroquois. The belt depicts the nations in a specific order from left to right. The Seneca are furthest to the left, representing their position as Keepers of the Western Door. Next is the Cayuga, and in the center of the belt, depicted with a different symbol, is the Onondaga, also known as the Keepers of the Central Fire. Next is the Oneida. Finally, shown farthest to the right is the Mohawk, the Keepers of the Eastern Door. The white line connecting all of the symbols for each tribe together represents the unity of the Iroquois. It also represents the Great Law of Peace and the Iroquois Confederacy as a whole.

The wampum belt consists of black or purplish and white beads made of shells. Found in the Northeast of America, quahog clam shells are often used for the black and sometimes the white beads of these belts. Most often, the Iroquois used various types of whelk shells for the white beads.

Wampum figures in the story of Hiawatha. When Hiawatha was full of grief because his daughters were murdered, the Great Peacemaker gifted Hiawatha with the whelk shells and told him to put them on his eyes and ears and throat. These shells were a sign of healing and purity. Hiawatha used these shells to create unity. The Iroquois Nation believes that the Peacemaker was the one who gifted them the first wampum belt, which later was titled the Hiawatha Belt.

Today the image of the Hiawatha Belt is used on the Flag of the Iroquois Confederacy.

== &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; ==
The 1855 epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow tells the story of a hero of the same name but has no relationship to the historical Hiawatha.

The poem has little to do with the actual Hiawatha; Longfellow most likely took the name of Hiawatha and applied it to the Ojibway demigod Manabozho. 

Longfellow tells the story of a legendary heroic Native man starting from his birth and ending on his ascension to the clouds. It talks of many battles, losses, and moral lessons. Longfellow, along with another writer, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, hoped to combine stories of Native Americans and create a sense of pride and remembrance for the Native Americans during the 1820s and later.

<doc id="215488" wikidata="Q353464" url="?curid=215488" title="Alexandre Pétion">
<text>Alexandre Sabès Pétion (; 2 April 1770 – 29 March 1818) was the first president of the Republic of Haiti from 1807 until his death in 1818. One of Haiti&#x27;s founding fathers, Pétion belonged to the revolutionary quartet that also includes Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and his later rival Henri Christophe. Regarded as an excellent artilleryman in his early adulthood, Pétion would distinguish himself as an esteemed military commander with experience leading both French and Haitian troops. The 1802 coalition formed by him and Dessalines against French forces led by Charles Leclerc would prove to be a watershed moment in the decade-long conflict, eventually culminating in the decisive Haitian victory at the Battle of Vertières in 1803.

==Early life==
Pétion was born &quot;Anne Alexandre Sabès&quot; in Port-au-Prince to Pascal Sabès, a wealthy French father and Ursula, a free mulatto woman, which made him a &quot;quadroon&quot; (a quarter African ancestry). Like other &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color) with wealthy fathers, Pétion was sent to France in 1788 to be educated and study at the Military Academy in Paris.

In Saint-Domingue, as in other French colonies such as Louisiane, the free people of color constituted a third caste between the whites and enslaved Africans. While restricted in political rights, many received social capital from their fathers and became educated and wealthy landowners, resented by the &quot;petits blancs&quot;, who were mostly minor tradesmen. Following the French Revolution, the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; led a rebellion to gain the voting and political rights which they believed were due them as French citizens; this was before the 1791 slave rebellion. At that time, most free people of color did not support freedom or political rights for slaves.

==Haitian Revolution==

Pétion returned to Saint-Domingue as a young man to take part in the Haitian Revolution, participating in skirmishes with British forces in northern Saint-Domingue. There had long been racial and class tensions between the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; and enslaved and free blacks in Saint-Domingue, where the enslaved black population outnumbered the white and &quot;gens de couleur&quot; by ten to one. During the years of warfare against French planters (commonly referred to as &quot;grands blancs&quot;), racial tensions in Saint-Domingue were exacerbated in competition for power and political alliances.

When tensions arose between full blacks and mulattoes, Pétion frequently supported the mulatto faction. He allied with General André Rigaud and Jean-Pierre Boyer against Toussaint Louverture in a failed rebellion, the so-called &quot;War of Knives&quot;, in the South of Saint-Domingue, which began in June 1799. By November, the rebels were pushed back to the strategic southern port of Jacmel; the defence was commanded by Pétion. The town fell in March 1800 and the rebellion was effectively over. Pétion and other mulatto leaders went into exile in France.

In February 1802, General Charles Leclerc arrived with tens of warships and 32,000 French troops to bring Saint-Domingue under more control. Gens de couleur Petion, Boyer, and Rigaud returned with him in the hope of securing power in the colony.

Following the French deportation of Toussaint Louverture and the renewed struggle, Pétion joined the nationalist force in October 1802. This followed a secret conference at Arcahaie, where Pétion supported Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the general who had captured Jacmel. The rebels took the capital of Port-au-Prince on October 17, 1803. Dessalines proclaimed independence on 1 January 1804, naming the nation Haiti. On 6 October 1804, Dessalines declared himself ruler for life and was crowned Emperor of Haiti as Jacques I.

==Post-revolution==
Disaffected members of Emperor Dessalines&#x27;s administration, including Pétion and Henri Christophe, began a conspiracy to overthrow Dessalines. Following the assassination of Dessalines on 17 October 1806, Pétion championed the ideals of democracy and clashed with Henri Christophe who wanted absolute rule. Christophe was elected president, but he did not believe the position had sufficient power, as Pétion kept powers for himself. Christophe went to the north with his followers and established an autocracy, declaring the State of Haiti. The loyalties of the country divided between them, and the tensions between the blacks and mulattoes of the North and South, respectively, were reignited.

Pétion was elected President in 1807 of the southern Republic of Haiti. After the inconclusive struggle dragged on until 1810, a peace treaty was agreed to, and the country was split in two. In 1811, Christophe made himself king of the northern Kingdom of Haiti.

On 2 June 1816, Pétion modified the terms of the presidency in the constitution, making himself president for life. Initially a supporter of democracy, Pétion found the constraints imposed on him by the senate onerous and suspended the legislature in 1818.

Pétion seized commercial plantations from the rich gentry. He had the land redistributed to his supporters and the peasantry, earning him the nickname &quot;Papa Bon-Cœur&quot; (&quot;good-hearted father&quot;). The land seizures and changes in agriculture reduced the production of commodities for the export economy. Most of the population became full subsistence farmers, and exports and state revenue declined sharply, making survival difficult for the new state.

Believing in the importance of education, Pétion started the Lycée Pétion in Port-au-Prince. Petion&#x27;s virtues and ideals of freedom and democracy for the world (and especially slaves) were strong, and he often showed support for the oppressed. He gave sanctuary to the independence leader Simón Bolívar in 1815 and provided him with material and infantry support. This vital aid played a defining role in Bolivar&#x27;s success in liberating the countries of what would make up Gran Colombia. Petion was reported to be influenced by his (and his successor&#x27;s) lover, Marie-Madeleine Lachenais, who acted as his political adviser.

Pétion named General Boyer as his successor as president of the Republic of Haiti; he took control in 1818 following the death of Pétion from yellow fever. After Henri Christophe of the Kingdom of Haiti and his son died in 1820, Boyer reunited the nation under his rule.

<text>David Law (1908 – April 1971) was a Scottish cartoonist best known for creating &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and &quot;Beryl the Peril&quot; for Dundee publishers D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd .

==Life==
Law was born and raised in Edinburgh and educated at Edinburgh College of Art. He first worked for Odhams Press as an illustrator, before moving to D. C. Thomson in the early 1930s. He drew cartoons for Thomsons newspapers like the &quot;Evening Telegraph&quot;, including a strip called &quot;The Wee Fella&quot;.

His most famous creation, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, first appeared in &quot;The Beano&quot; issue 452, dated 17 March 1951. Due to British comics being printed several days before distribution to newsagents (bearing the date of the following week to give them a longer shelf life), it seems beyond dispute that the UK Dennis saw print before Hank Ketcham&#x27;s identically named &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, which began syndication in the USA on 12 March 1951. It is possible that - at the very latest - the British version could have made his public debut on the same day as his Stateside counterpart, although it seems likely that he preceded him even in that. However, it is still unknown which character was actually created first. Law&#x27;s &quot;Dennis&quot; was a juvenile anti-hero, uncontrollable and destructive, drawn in spontaneous, edgy lines, and was an immediate hit; the strip eventually displaced &quot;Biffo the Bear&quot; on the comic&#x27;s full colour front cover in 1974. Law went on to create &quot;Beryl the Peril&quot;, a similarly anarchic female character, for the &quot;Topper&quot; in 1953, and the accident-prone soldier &quot;Corporal Clott&quot; for &quot;The Dandy&quot; in 1960.

He was taken ill in 1970, and his strips were taken over by other artists, including David Sutherland on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and John Dallas on &quot;Beryl the Peril&quot;. Law returned briefly to &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1971, but died in April that year, aged 63.

<doc id="215493" wikidata="Q115868328" url="?curid=215493" title="Rasher (comics)">
<text>Rasher is a British comic strip published in the comics magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;, featuring Dennis the Menace&#x27;s pet pig Rasher. It was initially drawn by David Sutherland and published five years after the character&#x27;s first appearance. Due to &quot;The Beano&quot; 2012 continuity, Rasher&#x27;s daughter (also named Rasher) has succeeded the role, particularly in &quot;Dennis And Gnasher: Unleashed!&quot;.

== Character background ==
Rasher is a pig obsessed with food, either seen eating it (usually by stealing the food from an unsuspecting human) or daydreaming about it. A method of attack to get the food is by either butting humans or racing past them quick enough so they fail to notice their food has disappeared.

== Publication history ==
=== Introduction to &quot;The Beano&quot; ===
Rasher made his first appearance in &quot;The Beano&quot; in issue 1920 in &quot;Dennis the Menace and Gnasher&quot;. Dennis and Gnasher walk by a farm and notice the farmer&#x27;s pig used its trough to prank him. Dennis is intrigued and successfully takes the pig off the relieved farmer&#x27;s hands, naming it Rasher.

=== &quot;Rasher&quot; comic strip ===
Rasher received his eponymous comic strip in issue 2201, illustrated by Dave Sutherland. It is notable of being the last comic strip published with Harold Cramond as &quot;Beano&quot; chief-editor. Early stories also featured Rasher&#x27;s family, such his brother Hamlet, his sister Virginia Ham, Uncle Crackling and Little Piglet, who were all introduced in the first episode. The series ran for over a decade in over 500 issues, and ended in 1995.

From issue 3480, older &quot;Rasher&quot; strips were reprinted in full colour in &quot;The Beano&quot;. Lew Stringer helmed the reboot from issue 3660, which was a part of the Funsize Funnies section. This new series has appeared infrequently throughout the 2010s.

=== Subsequent appearances ===
Rasher has appeared in Dennis&#x27; comic strips sporadically, unlike Dennis&#x27; other pet, Gnasher, who stars in every issue (apart from a few issues in 1986). Rasher is absent in the &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; cartoon adaptations, notably not appearing in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Dennis and Gnasher&quot;, despite the cartoon featuring Dennis&#x27; grandmother having a pet pig named Harley. Eventually, Rasher returned in &quot;Beano&quot; 3601, featuring in &quot;Dennis and Gnasher&quot; alongside Harley.

Issue 3649 shifted &quot;Beano&quot; continuity as Gok Wan gave Dennis&#x27; parents a makeover, which was later revealed that Dennis&#x27; father turned into the original Dennis who had grown up, married and had his own children. Stringer&#x27;s &quot;Rasher&quot; reboot implies this change does not affect Rasher, but in the franchise retooling for &quot;Dennis and Gnasher: Unleashed!&quot;, the Rasher who appears in the cartoon is black and white like a cow, and revealed as the daughter of the Rasher the original Dennis owned. Unlike her father, she prefers eating turnips.

As of September 2024, Rasher&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;The Beano&quot; was in issue 4253.

==== In &quot;Beano&quot; media ====
Rasher appears in other parts of &quot;Beano&quot; franchise. In &quot;The Beano Annual&quot;s, Rasher&#x27;s stories have appeared from 1986 to 1989&#x27;s editions, but Rasher actually appeared a few annuals earlier in Rasher-themed puzzle games in 1984&#x27;s and 1985&#x27;s. The &quot;Rasher&quot; series mostly appeared in 1983&#x27;s, 1985&#x27;s and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Beano Summer Special&quot;s.

The new Rasher appeared in the 2014 annual, where she was drawn by David Sutherland.

<text>The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) is the largest of all kangaroos, the largest terrestrial mammal native to Australia, and the largest extant marsupial. It is found across mainland Australia, except for the more fertile areas, such as southern Western Australia, the eastern and southeastern coasts, and the rainforests along the northern coast.

== Taxonomy ==
The initial description of the species by A.G. Desmarest was published in 1822. The type location was given as an unknown location west of the Blue Mountains.
The author assigned the new species to the genus &quot;Kangurus&quot;. In 1842, Gould reassigned the species to the genus &quot;Osphranter&quot;,
a taxon later submerged as a subgenus of &quot;Macropus&quot;. A taxonomic restructure in 2015 in &quot;Taxonomy of Australian Mammals&quot; by Jackson and Groves
promoted &quot;Osphranter&quot; back to the genus level, redefining the red kangaroo, among others, as a species within the genus &quot;Osphranter&quot;. This was further supported by genetic analysis in 2019.

== Description ==
This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a square shaped muzzle (snout/nose). They are sexually dimorphic; males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs, while females are smaller than males and are blue-grey with a brown tinge and pale grey below, although arid zone females are coloured more like males. It has two forelimbs with small claws, two muscular hind-limbs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used to create a tripod when standing upright.

Males grow up to a head-and-body length of with a tail that adds a further to the total length. Adult males are referred to by Australians as &quot;Big Reds&quot;. Females are considerably smaller, with a head-and-body length of and tail length of . Females can weigh from , while males typically weigh about twice as much at . The average red kangaroo stands approximately tall to the top of the head in upright posture. Large mature males can stand more than tall, with the largest confirmed one having been around tall and weighed .

The red kangaroo maintains its internal temperature at a point of homeostasis about using a variety of physical, physiological, and behavioural adaptations. These include having an insulating layer of fur, being less active and staying in the shade when temperatures are high, panting, sweating, and licking its forelimbs. They have an exceptional ability to survive in extreme temperatures using a cooling mechanism where they can increase their panting and sweating rates in high temperatures to cool their bodies. To survive in harsh conditions and conserve energy, Red kangaroos can enter a state of torpor. Red kangaroos also have a high tolerance for consuming plants high in salt content, and can survive for long periods without water by reabsorbing water from their urine in the kidneys, minimizing water loss. They can go for extended periods without drinking, meeting moisture requirements from consumed vegetation.

The red kangaroo&#x27;s range of vision is approximately 300° (324° with about 25° overlap), due to the position of its eyes.

== Locomotion ==
The red kangaroo&#x27;s legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. They can reach speeds of around . The males can cover in one leap while reaching heights of , though the average is .

== Ecology and habitat ==
The red kangaroo ranges throughout western and central Australia. Its range encompasses scrubland, grassland, and desert habitats. It typically inhabits open habitats with some trees for shade. Red kangaroos are capable of conserving enough water and selecting enough fresh vegetation to survive in an arid environment. The kangaroo&#x27;s kidneys efficiently concentrate urine, particularly during summer. Red kangaroo primarily eat green vegetation, particularly fresh grasses and forbs, and can get enough even when most plants look brown and dry. One study of kangaroos in Central Australia found that green grass makes up 75–95% of the diet, with &quot;Eragrostis setifolia&quot; dominating at 54%. This grass continues to be green into the dry season. Kangaroos primarily consumed this species, along with &quot;Enneapogon avenaceus&quot; in western New South Wales, where it comprised as much as 21–69% of the red kangaroo&#x27;s diet according to one study. During dry times, kangaroos search for green plants by staying on open grassland and near watercourses. While grasses and forbs are preferred, red kangaroos will also eat certain species of chenopods, like &quot;Bassia diacantha&quot; and &quot;Maireana pyramidata&quot;, and will even browse shrubs when its favoured foods are scarce. However, some perennial chenopods, such as round-leaf chenopod &quot;Kochia&quot; are avoided even when abundant.
At times, red kangaroos congregate in large numbers; in areas with much forage, these groups can number as much as 1,500 individuals. Red kangaroos are mostly crepuscular and nocturnal, resting in the shade during the day. However, they sometimes move about during the day. Red kangaroos rely on small saltbushes or mulga bushes for shelter in extreme heat rather than rocky outcrops or caves. Grazing takes up most of their daily activities. Like most kangaroo species, they are mostly sedentary, staying within a relatively well-defined home range. However, great environmental changes can cause them to travel great distances. Kangaroos in New South Wales have weekly home ranges of , with the larger areas belonging to adult males. When forage is poor and rainfall patchy, kangaroos will travel to more favourable feeding grounds. Another study of kangaroos in central Australia found that most of them stay close to remaining vegetation but disperse to find fresh plants after it rains. The red kangaroo is too big to be subject to significant non-human predation. They can use their robust legs and clawed feet to defend themselves from attackers with kicks and blows. However, dingoes and birds of prey are potential predators of joeys and a pack of dingos or a pair of wedge-tailed eagles can occasionally kill adults. Additionally, saltwater crocodiles can prey on kangaroos. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a terrestrial predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.

== Behaviour ==

Red kangaroos live in groups of 2–4 members. The most common groups are females and their young. Larger groups can be found in densely populated areas and females are usually with a male. Membership of these groups is very flexible, and males (boomers) are not territorial, fighting only over females (flyers) that come into heat. Males develop proportionately much larger shoulders and arms than females. Most agonistic interactions occur between young males, which engage in ritualised fighting known as &quot;boxing&quot;. They usually stand up on their hind limbs and attempt to push their opponent off balance by jabbing him or locking forearms. If the fight escalates, they will begin to kick each other. Using their tail to support their weight, they deliver kicks with their powerful hind legs. Compared to other kangaroo species, fights between red kangaroo males tend to involve more wrestling. Fights establish dominance relationships among males, and determine who gets access to estrous females. Dominant males make agonistic behaviours and more sexual behaviours until they are overthrown. Displaced males live alone and avoid close contact with others.
=== Reproduction ===

The red kangaroo breeds all year round. The females have the unusual ability to delay the birth of their baby until their previous joey has left the pouch. This is known as embryonic diapause. Copulation may last 25 minutes. The red kangaroo has the typical reproductive system of a kangaroo. The neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long. Its hind legs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother&#x27;s abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the two teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother&#x27;s sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After approximately 190 days, the baby (called a joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after around 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. While the young joey will permanently leave the pouch at around 235 days old, it will continue to suckle until it reaches about 12 months of age. A doe may first reproduce as early as 18 months of age and as late as five years during drought, but normally she is two and a half years old before she begins to breed.
The female red kangaroo is usually permanently pregnant except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, red kangaroo mothers may &quot;have up to three generations of offspring simultaneously; a young-at-foot suckling from an elongated teat, a young in the pouch attached to a second teat and a blastula in arrested development in the uterus&quot;.

The red kangaroo has also been observed to engage in alloparental care, a behaviour in which a female may adopt another female&#x27;s joey. This is a common parenting behaviour seen in many other animal species like wolves, elephants and fathead minnows.

== Relationship with humans ==

The red kangaroo is an abundant species and has even benefited from the spread of agriculture and creation of man-made waterholes. However, competition with livestock and rabbits poses a threat. They are also sometimes shot by farmers as pests, although in Queensland and New South Wales a permit is required.

Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of vehicles, severely damaging or destroying smaller or unprotected vehicles. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact. As a result, &quot;kangaroo crossing&quot; signs are commonplace in Australia.

Peak times for kangaroo/vehicle crashes are between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM, in winter, and after extended dry-weather spells.

=== Commercial use ===
Like all Australian wildlife, the red kangaroo is protected by legislation, but it is so numerous that there is regulated harvest of its hide and meat. Hunting permits and commercial harvesting are controlled under nationally approved management plans, which aim to maintain red kangaroo populations and manage them as a renewable resource. In 2023, over half a million red kangaroos were harvested across all of Australia. Harvesting of kangaroos is controversial, particularly due to the animal&#x27;s popularity.

In the year 2000, 1,173,242 animals were killed. In 2009 the government put a limit of 1,611,216 for the number of red kangaroos available for commercial use. The kangaroo industry is worth about A$270 million each year, and employs over 4000 people.
The kangaroos provide meat for both humans and pet food. Kangaroo meat is very lean with only about 2% fat. Their skins are used for leather.

<doc id="215509" wikidata="Q533945" url="?curid=215509" title="Paleolithic diet">
<text>The Paleolithic diet, Paleo diet, caveman diet, or Stone Age diet is a modern fad diet consisting of foods thought by its proponents to mirror those eaten by humans during the Paleolithic era.

The diet avoids food processing and typically includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, and meat and excludes dairy products, grains, sugar, legumes, processed oils, salt, alcohol, and coffee. Historians can trace the ideas behind the diet to &quot;primitive&quot; diets advocated in the 19th century. In the 1970s, Walter L. Voegtlin popularized a meat-centric &quot;Stone Age&quot; diet; in the 21st century, the best-selling books of Loren Cordain popularized the &quot;Paleo diet&quot;. the Paleolithic diet industry was worth approximately  million.

In the 21st century, the sequencing of the human genome and DNA analysis of the remains of anatomically modern humans have found evidence that humans evolved rapidly in response to changing diet. This evidence undermines a core premise of the Paleolithic diet—that human digestion has remained essentially unchanged over time. Paleoanthropological evidence has indicated that prehistoric humans ate plant-heavy diets that regularly included grains and other starchy vegetables, in contrast to the claims made by proponents of the Paleolithic diet. 

Advocates promote the paleolithic diet as a way of improving health. There is some evidence that following it may lead to improvements in body composition and metabolism compared with the typical Western diet or compared with diets recommended by some European nutritional guidelines. On the other hand, following the diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as an inadequate calcium intake, and side effects can include weakness, diarrhea, and headaches.

==History and terminology==
Adrienne Rose Johnson writes that the idea that the primitive diet was superior to current dietary habits dates back to the 1890s with such writers as Emmet Densmore and John Harvey Kellogg. Densmore proclaimed that &quot;bread is the staff of death&quot;, while Kellogg supported a diet of starchy and grain-based foods in accord with &quot;the ways and likings of our primitive ancestors&quot;. Arnold DeVries advocated an early version of the Paleolithic diet in his 1952 book, &quot;Primitive Man and His Food&quot;. In 1958, Richard Mackarness authored &quot;Eat Fat and Grow Slim&quot;, which proposed a low-carbohydrate &quot;Stone Age&quot; diet.

In his 1975 book &quot;The Stone Age Diet&quot;, gastroenterologist Walter L. Voegtlin advocated a meat-based diet, with low proportions of vegetables and starchy foods, based on his declaration that humans were &quot;exclusively flesh-eaters&quot; until 10,000 years ago.

In 1985 Stanley Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner published a controversial article in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; proposing that modern humans were biologically very similar to their primitive ancestors and so &quot;genetically programmed&quot; to consume pre-agricultural foods. Eaton and Konner proposed a &quot;discordance hypothesis&quot; by which the mismatch between modern diet and human biology gave rise to lifestyle diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.

The diet started to become popular in the 21st century, where it attracted a largely internet-based following using web sites, forums and social media.

This diet&#x27;s ideas were further popularized by Loren Cordain, a health scientist with a Ph.D. in physical education, who trademarked the words &quot;The Paleo Diet&quot; and who wrote a 2002 book of that title.

In 2012 the paleolithic diet was described as being one of the &quot;latest trends&quot; in diets, based on the popularity of diet books about it; in 2013 and 2014 the Paleolithic diet was Google&#x27;s most searched weight-loss method.

The &quot;paleolithic&quot; or &quot;paleo&quot; diet is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;caveman&quot; or &quot;Stone Age&quot; diet.

==Foodstuffs==

The basis of the diet is a re-imagining of what Paleolithic people ate, and different proponents recommend different diet compositions. Eaton and Konner, for example, wrote a 1988 book &quot;The Paleolithic Prescription&quot; with Marjorie Shostak, and it described a diet that is 65% plant-based. This is not typical of more recently devised paleo diets; Loren Cordain&#x27;s – probably the most popular – instead emphasizes animal products and avoidance of processed food. Diet advocates concede the modern paleolithic diet cannot be a faithful recreation of what paleolithic people ate, and instead aim to &quot;translate&quot; that into a modern context, avoiding such likely historical practices as cannibalism.

Foodstuffs that have been described as permissible include:
* &quot;vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat, and organ meats&quot;;
* &quot;vegetables (including root vegetables), fruit (including fruit oils, e.g., olive oil, coconut oil, and palm oil), nuts, fish, meat, and eggs, and it excluded dairy, grain-based foods, legumes, extra sugar, and nutritional products of industry (including refined fats and refined carbohydrates)&quot;; and
* &quot;avoids processed foods, and emphasizes eating vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, eggs, and lean meats&quot;.

The diet forbids the consumption of all dairy products. This is because milking did not exist until animals were domesticated after the Paleolithic era.

===Ancestral diet===

Adopting the Paleolithic diet assumes that modern humans can reproduce the hunter-gatherer diet. Molecular biologist Marion Nestle argues that &quot;knowledge of the relative proportions of animal and plant foods in the diets of early humans is circumstantial, incomplete, and debatable and that there are insufficient data to identify the composition of a genetically determined optimal diet. The evidence related to Paleolithic diets is best interpreted as supporting the idea that diets based largely on plant foods promote health and longevity, at least under conditions of food abundance and physical activity.&quot; Ideas about Paleolithic diet and nutrition are at best hypothetical.

The data for Cordain&#x27;s book came from six contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, mainly living in marginal habitats. One of the studies was on the !Kung, whose diet was recorded for a single month, and one was on the diet of the Inuit. Due to these limitations, the book has been criticized as painting an incomplete picture of the diets of Paleolithic humans. It has been noted that the rationale for the diet does not adequately account for the fact that, due to the pressures of artificial selection, most modern domesticated plants and animals differ drastically from their Paleolithic ancestors; likewise, their nutritional profiles are very different from their ancient counterparts. For example, wild almonds produce potentially fatal levels of cyanide, but this trait has been bred out of domesticated varieties using artificial selection. Many vegetables, such as broccoli, did not exist in the Paleolithic period; broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale are modern cultivars of the ancient species &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;.

Trying to devise an ideal diet by studying contemporary hunter-gatherers is difficult because of the great disparities that exist; for example, the animal-derived calorie percentage ranges from 25% for the Gwi people of southern Africa to 99% for the Alaskan Nunamiut. Descendants of populations with different diets have different genetic adaptations to those diets, such as the ability to digest sugars from starchy foods. Modern hunter-gatherers tend to exercise considerably more than modern office workers, protecting them from heart disease and diabetes, though highly processed modern foods also contribute to diabetes when those populations move into cities.

A 2018 review of the diet of hunter-gatherer populations found that the dietary provisions of the paleolithic diet had been based on questionable research, and were &quot;difficult to reconcile with more detailed ethnographic and nutritional studies of hunter-gatherer diet&quot;.

Researchers have proposed that cooked starches met the energy demands of an increasing brain size, based on variations in the copy number of genes encoding amylase.

==Health effects==
The methodological quality of research into the paleolithic diet has been described as &quot;poor to moderate&quot;. Some of the health claims made for it by its proponents, such as its ability to reverse diabetes and cure autoimmune diseases are exaggerated, causing the diet to be controversial.

Following the paleolithic diet results in the consumption of fewer processed foods, less sugar, and less salt. Reduced consumption of these elements is consistent with mainstream advice about diet. Diets with a paleolithic nutrition pattern also share some similarities with traditional ethnic diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, which have been found to result in greater health benefits than the Western diet. Following the paleolithic diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as those of vitaminD and calcium, which can in turn lead to compromised bone health. The increased fish consumption suggested by the diet can also lead to an elevated risk of exposure to toxins.

There is some evidence that the diet can help in achieving weight loss, due to the increased satiety from the foods typically eaten. One trial of obese postmenopausal women found improvements in weight and fat loss after six months, but the benefits had ceased by 24 months. Side effects among these participants included &quot;weakness, diarrhea, and headaches&quot;. As with any other diet regime, the paleolithic diet leads to weight loss because of overall decreased caloric intake, rather than any specific feature of the diet itself.

There is no good evidence that following a paleolithic diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome, nor is there any evidence that the paleolithic diet is effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease.

The paleolithic diet is similar to the Atkins diet, in that it encourages the consumption of large amounts of red meat, especially meats high in saturated fat. Increased consumption of red meat can lead to a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.

==Proposed rationale and reception==
The stated rationale for the paleolithic diet is that human genes of modern times are unchanged from those of 10,000 years ago, and that the diet of that time is therefore the best fit with humans today. Loren Cordain has described the paleo diet as &quot;the one and only diet that ideally fits our genetic makeup&quot;.

The argument is that modern humans have not been able to adapt to the new circumstances. According to Cordain, before the agricultural revolution, hunter-gatherer diets rarely included grains, and obtaining milk from wild animals would have been &quot;nearly impossible&quot;. Advocates of the diet argue that the increase in diseases of affluence after the dawn of agriculture was caused by these changes in diet, but others have countered that it may be that pre-agricultural hunter-gatherers did not suffer from the diseases of affluence because they did not live long enough to develop them.

According to the model from the evolutionary discordance hypothesis, &quot;many chronic diseases and degenerative conditions evident in modern Western populations have arisen because of a mismatch between Stone Age genes and modern lifestyles.&quot; Advocates of the modern paleo diet have formed their dietary recommendations based on this hypothesis. They argue that modern humans should follow a diet that is nutritionally closer to that of their Paleolithic ancestors.

The evolutionary discordance is incomplete, since it is based mainly on the genetic understanding of the human diet and a unique model of human ancestral diets, without taking into account the flexibility and variability of the human dietary behaviors over time. Studies of a variety of populations around the world show that humans can live healthily with a wide variety of diets and that humans have evolved to be flexible eaters. Lactase persistence, which confers lactose tolerance into adulthood, is an example of how some humans have adapted to the introduction of dairy into their diet. While the introduction of grains, dairy, and legumes during the Neolithic Revolution may have had some adverse effects on modern humans, if humans had not been nutritionally adaptable, these technological developments would have been dropped.

Since the publication of Eaton and Konner&#x27;s paper in 1985, analysis of the DNA of primitive human remains has provided evidence that evolving humans were continually adapting to new diets, thus challenging the hypothesis underlying the paleothic diet. Evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk writes that the idea that our genetic makeup today matches that of our ancestors is misconceived, and that in debate Cordain was &quot;taken aback&quot; when told that 10,000 years was &quot;plenty of time&quot; for an evolutionary change in human digestive abilities to have taken place. On this basis Zuk dismisses Cordain&#x27;s claim that the paleo diet is &quot;the one and only diet that fits our genetic makeup&quot;.

Paleoanthropologist Peter Ungar has written that the paleo diet is a &quot;myth&quot;, on account both of its invocation of a single suitable diet when in reality humans have always been a &quot;work in progress&quot;, and because diet has always been varied because humans were spread widely over the planet.

Anthropological geneticist Anne C. Stone has said that humans have adapted in the last 10,000 years in response to radical changes in diet. In 2016, she was quoted as saying &quot;It drives me crazy when Paleo-diet people say that we&#x27;ve stopped evolving—we haven&#x27;t&quot;.

Melvin Konner has said the challenge to the hypothesis is not greatly significant since the real challenges to human non-adaptation have occurred with the rise of ever-more refined foodstuffs in the last 300 years.

==Environmental impact==
A 2019 analysis of diets in the United States ranked consumption of a paleolithic diet as more environmentally harmful than consumption of an omnivorous diet, though not so harmful as a ketogenic diet.

Elizabeth Kolbert has written the paleolithic diet&#x27;s emphasis on meat consumption is a &quot;disaster&quot; on account of meat&#x27;s comparatively high energy production costs.

==Popularity==
A lifestyle and ideology have developed around the diet. &quot;Paleolithic&quot; products include clothing, smartphone apps, and cookware. Many paleolithic cookery books have been bestsellers.

 the market for products with the word &quot;Paleo&quot; in their name was worth approximately $US500 million, with strong growth prospects despite pushback from the scientific community. Some products were taking advantage of the trend by touting themselves as &quot;paleo-approved&quot; despite having no apparent link to the movement&#x27;s tenets.

Like many other diets, the paleolithic diet is promoted by some by an appeal to nature and a narrative of conspiracy theories about how nutritional research, which does not support the supposed benefits of the paleolithic diet, is controlled by a malign food industry. Paleolithic diet advocate John Durant has blamed suppression of the truth about diet in the United States on &quot;the vegetarian lobby&quot;.

<doc id="215511" wikidata="Q7874101" url="?curid=215511" title="USS Shenandoah (1862)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was a wooden screw sloop of the United States Navy.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was built by the Philadelphia Navy Yard and launched on 8 December 1862. She was sponsored by Miss Selina Pascoe; and was commissioned on 20 June 1863, Captain Daniel B. Ridgeley in command.

==Civil War duty, 1863–1865==
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 25th, keeping a sharp lookout for Confederate raider, , as she made her trial run to Boston to fill out her complement. On 11 July, she sailed in search of Confederate raider, &quot;Florida&quot;, cruised off George&#x27;s and Nantucket shoals, thence preceded toward Block Island and Cape Sable. She returned to Boston on 27 July and spent from 4 August to 8 September in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 12 September, she arrived off New Inlet, North Carolina, to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; spent the greater part of the next fifteen months patrolling off Wilmington, North Carolina and searching on the blockade runner routes between Nassau and Wilmington. This cruising took her as far as Key West, Florida, and to the Bahamas and Bermuda. During a four-hour chase on 30 July 1864, she fired heavily into Confederate blockade runner, &quot;Lilian&quot;, which escaped in the darkness to the safety of Cape Lookout shoals. At daylight of 7 August, blockade runner, &quot;Falcon&quot;, narrowly escaped &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and by throwing cotton overboard to lighten load and then outsailing her pursuers in the direction of Cuba.

===The Battle of Fort Fisher===
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; reached Green Bay in the Bahamas on 13 December 1864 to investigate reports that Confederate privateers were being fitted out there to prey on Union commerce. Finding no trace of such activity, she hurried north to join the great Federal Fleet poised on the coast of North Carolina for the attack on Fort Fisher which protected Wilmington, North Carolina. On Christmas Eve, she closed to within 1,500 yards of the shore to bombard the works of Fort Fisher with all guns that could be brought to bear. In little more than an hour, the Confederate fort had been silenced, two of its magazines had been blown up, and the fort set afire in several places. The bombardment was kept up with good effect until after nightfall.

One shot from the Confederates carried away &quot;Shenandoah&#x27;s&quot; stern ladder. She renewed the action with other ships of the fleet on Christmas morning to cover the landing of about 3,000 Army troops. Her deliberate and well directed fire silenced a four-gun battery to the west of Fort Fisher. She then turned her attention to a two-gun casemated battery. One shell from this battery fell a few yards short, and another passed over &quot;Shenandoah&quot; which retaliated by exploding a 150-pounder rifle shell near the top of the mound.

Nevertheless, the amphibious assault failed to capture the fort and the Union troops re-embarked during the night, save for about 1,000 soldiers who found themselves stranded on the beach by heavy surf. These were safely returned to their transports during the following two days as &quot;Shenandoah&quot; patrolled off New Inlet.

The amphibious assault on Fort Fisher was renewed on 13 January 1865. &quot;Shenandoah&#x27;s&quot; boats assisted in the landing of about 8,000 Army troops under cover of a severe bombardment. The next day, she joined the fleet in a quick fire on the face of the works which lasted from 1300 till well after dark. That day, 1,600 sailors and 400 marines were detached from various ships to join the Army troops in the assault. Fifty-four sailors and fourteen marines under Lieutenant Smith W. Nichols, armed with cutlasses and revolvers, were landed from &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. The furious bombardment support continued until 1500 on 15 January 1865. By this time, the sailors and marines were entrenched within 200 yards of the fort and ready for the final assault. The ships now shifted their fire to the upper batteries as troops and sailors dashed toward the top of the parapet.

The advancing sailors and marines were swept by concentrated Confederate gunfire; but Army troops, who had gained the highest parapet to the rear, opened with a volley of musketry to save them. Now the fighting progressed through seventeen immense bomb-proof traverses until the Confederates were finally forced to the end of Federal Point. Finding themselves hopelessly surrounded, the Confederate remnants surrendered, and Fort Fisher fell to the largest amphibious operation in American history prior to World War II.

&quot;Shenandoah&#x27;s&quot; landing force returned with six wounded and five missing in action. Lt. Nichols reported: &quot;Each and all deserve the highest commendation for their coolness and courage under the most trying circumstances, and fully sustained the hard earned reputation of the American sailor...&quot;

After Fort Fisher was captured, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; spent a few days carrying wounded men from transports to shore hospitals. She then joined in the final days of the Union siege of Charleston which fell on 17 February. She returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 15 March and was decommissioned there on 15 April.

==Service in South America and Asia 1865–1869==
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; recommissioned at Philadelphia on 20 November 1865, Captain John R. Goldsborough in command. She put to sea on 8 December for the Azores. Thence, she sailed to Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for service with the South American Squadron. On 28 April 1866, she departed Rio de Janeiro to join the Asiatic Squadron. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, she visited Bombay and Calcutta; then touched at Penang before arriving at Singapore on 31 December 1866. She next proceeded to Bangkok where she received a friendly greeting from the King of Siam and his ministers before sailing via Saigon for Japan. She arrived at Yokohama on 5 April 1867.

There, on the 27th, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; embarked General Robert B. Van Valkenburgh, U.S. Minister to Japan, for transport to Osaka where he landed on 1 May for an interview with the Tycoon. There he learned that the Japanese government proposed to open additional ports to foreign trade. His mission was completed by 20 May when he returned on board &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to return to Yokohama. The ship was then placed at General Van Valkenburgh&#x27;s disposal, to assist him in examining the different ports most suitable for commercial purposes. She left Yokohama on 25 June and reached Hakodate on the 28th. The first salute that was ever fired there in honor of a foreign minister marked the occasion. The minister and officers of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; were received by the governor with cordial politeness.

On 12 July, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; entered the port of Niigata where similar courtesies were extended. Nahon was reached the following day. No American ship had ever before entered that harbor. On the 17th, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; visited Mikuni and also Tsurunga, where no foreign warship had ever previously anchored. On 20 July, she arrived at Miyadsu, the most beautiful of the bays visited. Commodore Goldsborough and officers under his command made surveys of most of these new harbors, and prepared sailing directions for their entrance.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was part of the naval force before the ports of Osaka and Hyōgo which were quietly opened to foreigners on 1 January 1868. The event was celebrated by American and British ships, their mastheads being dressed with the respective national flags and the Tycoon&#x27;s flag at the main. Each ship simultaneously fired a salute of twenty-one guns, which the Japanese promptly returned.

On the morning of 11 January, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; sent her boats to assist in the search for Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Squadron, whose boat had capsized while attempting to cross the bar on the way into Osaka from flagship . The admiral was drowned along with his flag-lieutenant and ten of the boat&#x27;s thirteen crewmen. Command of the Asiatic Squadron now devolved upon Commodore John R. Goldsborough, as senior officer, until the arrival of Rear Admiral Stephen C. Rowan. Commodore Goldsborough transferred his pennant from &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to &quot;Hartford&quot; on 31 January 1868.

===Korea===
Lieutenant Commander Chester Hartford took temporary command of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; until 22 February 1868 when Cdr. John C. Febiger assumed command at Shanghai. From there &quot;Shenandoah&quot; proceeded to Chefoo, China, where she received orders to sail for Korea to attempt to rescue the crew of the American schooner, &quot;General Sherman&quot;, which had been destroyed in the Ping Yang River some eighteen months previously. It had been rumored that some of the crew or passengers were alive and in captivity. Korea, at that time, sought to exclude all strangers or foreigners.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed Chefoo on 7 April 1868 and arrived off Chodo Island, Korea, on 9 April. After proceeding around to the southeast side, she arrived at the mouth of the Ping Yang River on the 16th. Commodore Goldsborough concluded from the information gathered that none of the passengers and crew of &quot;General Sherman&quot; had survived. He succeeded, however, in making a survey of the Ping Yang River and its approaches and in securing other useful data on that part of the Korean coast where no previous surveys had been made.

On 18 May, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed the mouth of the Ping Yang River to join the Asiatic Squadron in visiting the principal commercial ports of China and Japan to counter difficulties that arose out of opposition to contact with foreigners. Certain ships of the squadron stationed themselves in areas where roving Chinese pirates had attacked the American merchantmen. They protected foreign settlements in Yokohama as well as in the newly opened ports of Osaka and Hyōgo. They continued their service until local authorities assured the American officers that foreigners would receive respectful and peaceful treatment. The Chinese Viceroy at Canton promised Commodore Goldsborough that he would issue a proclamation prohibiting fishing junks from carrying extra men, or arms, or munitions of war which might be used to prey upon American commerce.

After calling at Chefoo, Shanghai, Yokohama, and Hong Kong, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed the latter port on 10 November. She visited Batavia, Java (1 to 8 December); thence proceeded, via the Cape of Good Hope and the island of St. Helena, to Boston where she arrived on 25 April 1869. She decommissioned there on 2 May 1869.

==The European station 1870–1874==
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was recommissioned at Boston on 15 August 1870, and sailed on 4 September for service on the European Station. After a call at Lisbon and station duty at Le Havre, she touched Southampton on her way to the Mediterranean to show the flag at such ports as Ville Franche, Toulon, Marseille, Genoa, Alexandria, and Naples. While at Ville Franche on 15 December 1871, Seaman Isaac Sapp jumped overboard and rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. On 1 June 1872, she set course north for Lisbon, Queenstown, Plymouth, and Southampton; thence proceeded to Lisbon, Cádiz, Algiers, Tunis, Malta, and Piraeus. In the last named port, Christmas Day of 1872, she was host to the King and Queen of Greece. The following months found her at such ports as Smyrna, Turkey; Syracuse, Sicily; Ville Franche, France; and Barcelona, Spain. She departed the Mediterranean on 12 December 1873 for Tangiers; thence proceeded, via Funchal, Madeira, and St. Thomas in the West Indies, to Florida. She arrived in Key West on 22 January 1874 and sailed on 4 April for New York where she decommissioned on 23 April 1874.

==The South Atlantic 1879–1882==
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was recommissioned in the New York Navy Yard on 8 September 1879. On 4 October, she sailed for Brazil, and arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 1 December 1879 to serve as flagship of Rear Admiral Andrew Bryson who commanded the South Atlantic Squadron. She watched over American interests in that quarter while cruising between Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. While at Rio de Janeiro on 19 September 1880, Seamen William Morse and John Smith rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which they were later awarded the Medal of Honor. This duty terminated on 4 February 1882 when &quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed Montevideo on a homeward-bound cruise that included calls at Barbados in the West Indies, Cartagena, Colombia and Havana, Cuba. She arrived at New York on 29 April and was decommissioned in the New York Navy Yard on 27 May 1882.

==Final days 1883–1887==
Her last cruise took &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She was recommissioned at Boston on 5 November 1883 and sailed on 29 December for the Cape Verde Islands. Thence, she steamed via Montevideo and around Cape Horn to Valparaíso, Chile, where she arrived on 5 May 1884 – one day after the Treaty of Valparaíso marked Chile&#x27;s victory in her war with Peru and Bolivia.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; cruised among parts of Peru, Chile, and Ecuador protecting American interests until 6 April 1885 when she arrived off Panama as part of the Panama crisis of 1885. Her landing party protected American property there during revolt against the Colombian Government that resulted in insurgent occupation of Panama. Aspinwall, on the Atlantic side, was attacked by insurgents who also occupied the greater portion of the isthmus, blocking the transit of the railroad. Obliged by the treaty of 1846 to guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus as well as rights of sovereignty by Colombia, the United States took immediate action. A naval force of eight ships and 2,648 sailors and marines under Rear Admiral James Edward Jouett arrived at Aspinwall and protected that town while a landing expedition proceeded across the isthmus to reestablish free passage for trains.

On 24 May 1885, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed Panama for Callao, Peru. She continued to cruise for protection of the American mercantile marine and other interests for the next seventeen months. Besides showing the flag at the principal ports of Chile and Peru, she called from time to time at San Jose, Guatemala; Corinto, Nicaragua; Panama, and Acapulco, Mexico. She arrived in Santa Barbara, California, from the Mexican coast on 30 September 1886. After a visit to Monterey, she was decommissioned in the Mare Island Navy Yard on 23 October 1886. She was sold on 30 July 1887 to W. T. Garratt &amp; Company, San Francisco, California.

<text>The longclaws are a genus, Macronyx, of small African passerine birds in the family Motacillidae.

Longclaws are slender, often colorful, ground-feeding insectivores of open country. They are ground nesters, laying up to four speckled eggs. They are named for their unusually long hind claws, which are thought to help walk on grass. There are only between 10,000 and 19,000 Sharpe&#x27;s longclaw left in Kenya.

The genus &quot;Macronyx&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827 with the Cape longclaw as the type species. The name combines the Classical Greek words &quot;long&quot; or &quot;great&quot; and &quot;claw&quot;.

==Species list==
The genus contains eight species:

<text>L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or (, ), commonly translated as The Golden Age or Age of Gold, is a 1930 French surrealist satirical comedy film directed by Luis Buñuel about the insanities of modern life, the hypocrisy of the sexual mores of bourgeois society, and the value system of the Catholic Church. Much of the story is told with title cards like a predominantly silent film. The screenplay is by Buñuel and Salvador Dalí. &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; was one of the first sound films made in France, along with &quot;Miss Europe&quot; and &quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The first scene of the film is a documentary about scorpions. After that, the film is a series of vignettes, wherein a couple&#x27;s attempts at consummating their romantic relationship are continually thwarted by the bourgeois values and sexual mores of family, church, and society.

The couple are first seen creating a disturbance by making love in the mud during a religious ceremony. The man is apprehended and led away by two men who struggle to control their captive&#x27;s sudden impulses. He momentarily breaks free long enough to kick a small dog. Later he struggles free to aggressively crush a beetle with his shoe. As he is escorted through city streets, he sees an advertisement that inspires him to fantasize a woman&#x27;s hand rubbing herself, and becomes transfixed by another advertisement showing a woman&#x27;s legs in silk stockings. He eventually escapes his handlers, inexplicably assaults a blind man standing at a curb, and gets into a taxi.

Meanwhile, the woman is at home, where she tells her mother she hurt her finger, which is wrapped in a bandage that disappears and reappears from scene to scene. The woman and her parents attend a party where the guests seem oblivious to alarming or incongruous events in their midst: a maid screams and falls to the floor after emerging from a doorway where flames are visible; a horse-drawn cart filled with rowdy men drinking from large bottles passes through the elegant company in the ballroom; the father converses with guests while ignoring several flies on his face; a small boy is shot and killed for a minor prank.

The man arrives at the party and sees his lover from across the room. He behaves brusquely toward the other guests while looking ardently in the woman&#x27;s direction, and she looks longingly at him. The woman&#x27;s mother hands the man a drink, but spills a drop on his hand. He becomes enraged and slaps her, which seems to excite the daughter. Seeking sexual release and satisfaction, the couple go into the garden and make love next to a marble statue, while the rest of the party guests assemble outdoors for an orchestral performance of &quot;Liebestod&quot;. When the man is called away to answer a telephone call, the woman sublimates her sexual passion by fellating the toe of the statue until the man returns.

The &quot;Liebestod&quot; music stops abruptly when the conductor, his hands gripping his head, walks away, and wanders into the garden where the couple are. The woman runs to comfort the elderly conductor before finally French kissing him. The man stands up, bumping his head on a hanging flower pot, and grasps his head in pain as he leaves the garden. He stumbles away to her bedroom where he throws a burning tree, a bishop, a plow, the bishop&#x27;s staff, a giraffe statue and handfuls of pillow feathers out the window.

The final vignette is an allusion to the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s 1785 novel (first published in 1904) &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot;—the intertitle reads: &quot;120 Days of Depraved Acts&quot;—and is about an orgy in a castle, wherein the surviving orgiasts are ready to emerge to the light of mainstream society. From the castle door emerges the bearded and berobed Duc de Blangis (a character from de Sade&#x27;s novel) who greatly resembles Jesus, the Christ, who comforts a young woman who has run out from the castle, before he takes her back inside. Afterwards, a woman&#x27;s scream is heard, and only the Duc re-emerges; and he is beardless. The concluding image is a Christian cross festooned with the scalps of women; to the accompaniment of jovial music, the scalps sway in the wind.

==Production==
&quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; began as the second artistic collaboration between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí, who had fallen out by the time of the film&#x27;s production. A neophyte cinéast, Buñuel overcame his ignorance of cinematic production technique by sequentially filming most of the screenplay; the 63-minute film is composed of almost every meter of film exposed and dramatic sequence photographed.

The production budget was a million francs, and was financed and produced by the Vicomte Charles de Noailles (1891–1981), a nobleman who, beginning in 1928, yearly commissioned a film as a birthday gift to his wife, the Vicomtesse Marie-Laure de Noailles (1902–1970), who was a renowned patroness of the arts and of artists, such as Dalí and Buñuel, Balthus, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, Francis Poulenc, Jean Hugo, Jean-Michel Frank and others.

&quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; included actors who were famous artists, such as Max Ernst and Josep Llorens Artigas.

==Reception==
Upon receiving a cinematic exhibition permit from the Board of Censors, &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; had its premiere presentation at Studio 28, Paris, on 29 November 1930. Later, on 3 December, the great popular success of the film provoked attacks by the right-wing &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot; (League of Patriots), whose angry viewers took umbrage at the visual statements made by Buñuel and Dalí. The reactionary French &quot;Patriots&quot; interrupted the screening by throwing ink at the cinema screen and assaulting viewers who opposed them. They then went to the lobby and destroyed art works by Dalí, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, and others. On 10 December, the Prefect of Police of Paris, Jean Chiappe, arranged to have the film banned from further public exhibition after the Board of Censors re-reviewed the film.

A contemporary right-wing Spanish newspaper published a condemnation of the film and of Buñuel and Dalí, which described the content of the film as &quot;...the most repulsive corruption of our age ... the new poison which Judaism, Masonry, and rabid, revolutionary sectarianism want to use in order to corrupt the people&quot;. In response, the de Noailles family withdrew &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; from commercial distribution and public exhibition for more than forty years; nonetheless, three years later, in 1933, the film was privately exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City. Forty-nine years later, from 1–15 November 1979, the film had its legal U.S. premiere at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco.

The film critic Robert Short said that the scalp-decorated crucifix and the scenes of socially repressive violence, wherein the love-struck protagonist is manhandled by two men, indicate that the social and psychological repression of the libido and of romantic passion and emotion, by the sexual mores of bourgeois society and by the value system of the Roman Catholic Church, breed violence in the relations among people, and violence by men against women.

==Legacy==
Today, &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; is widely regarded as one of the key works of surrealist cinema. British critic Philip French noted that the film, alongside Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929), featured &quot;bizarre sequences that assault bourgeois values and sexual oppression while making no logical sense, and they were acclaimed by the leading arbiters of surrealism as the first authentic surrealist films&quot;. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, 15 critics and six directors named &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; one of their 10 favorite films in history. Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant&quot; analyzed the film&#x27;s sound design in relation to his argument that Buñuel&#x27;s overriding message is the ability of love to &quot;conquer all sorts of moral restraints&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes reports an average rating of 8.7/10 among 28 critics, with 89% approval overall.

The band Tin Machine, fronted by David Bowie, re-enacted the toe sucking scene in their video for the 1991 song &quot;You Belong in Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

The screening of &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; is dramatized in the 2018 Spanish-Dutch animated film &quot;Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles.&quot;

In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the Cannes Film Festival.

<text>The Long Trail is a hiking trail located in Vermont, running the length of the state. It is the oldest long-distance trail in the United States, constructed between 1910 and 1930 by the Green Mountain Club. The club remains the primary organization responsible for the trail, and is recognized by the state legislature as &quot;the founder, sponsor, defender, and protector&quot; of the Long Trail System.

==History==
The Long Trail was conceived in 1909 by James P. Taylor who was at the time the assistant headmaster of Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont. Taylor lobbied other Vermont residents who shared his dream of a mission to &quot;make the Vermont mountains play a larger part in the life of the people by protecting and maintaining the Long Trail system and fostering, through education, the stewardship of Vermont&#x27;s hiking trails and mountains&quot;. On March 11, 1910, Taylor and twenty-five others met at the Van Ness House in Burlington, Vermont for the first meeting of the Green Mountain Club In 1912, work began on the construction of America&#x27;s first long-distance hiking path. The GMC completed the Long Trail in 1930.

==Geography==

The Long Trail runs 273 miles (439 km) through the state of Vermont. It starts at the Massachusetts state line (at Clarksburg, Massachusetts), and runs north to the Canada–US border (in Jay, Vermont). It runs along the main ridge of the Green Mountains, coinciding with the Appalachian Trail (for which it served as the inspiration) for roughly in the southern third of the state. Additionally, over of side trails complete the Long Trail System.

The Long Trail passes through six of the eight wilderness areas in the Green Mountain National Forest, including (from south to north) Glastenbury Wilderness, Lye Brook Wilderness, Peru Peak Wilderness, Big Branch Wilderness, Joseph Battell Wilderness, and Breadloaf Wilderness. It traverses most of the major summits in the Green Mountains, including (from south to north) Glastenbury Mountain, Stratton Mountain, Killington Peak, Mount Abraham, Mount Ellen, Camel&#x27;s Hump, Mount Mansfield, and Jay Peak.

==Maintenance==

The Long Trail is maintained primarily by the Green Mountain Club and its volunteers. Twelve club sections maintain assigned sections of the Long Trail – two other club sections maintain the trails in Vermont&#x27;s Northeast Kingdom and the Appalachian Trail from Maine Junction in Killington to the Connecticut River. Although roughly 1,000 volunteers perform most of the club&#x27;s trail work, the club also employs a staff to handle day-to-day operations and a seasonal staff of summit caretakers and the Long Trail Patrol which works on heavy duty projects on the trail. The Green Mountain Club also receives assistance from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and private landowners. During the mud season in late spring, some sections of the trail are closed to hikers, to protect the trail from both erosion and to protect nearby flora from being damaged (especially the higher peaks that possess fragile alpine tundra).
==Historical Disappearances==

The section of the Long Trail between Woodford (on Vermont State Route 9 just east of Bennington, Vt) and Glastenbury Mountain some farther north has gained notoriety because six people vanished in that area between 1945 and 1950. Only one body was found and the fates of the other missing persons remain a mystery.

The case that perhaps gained the most media attention at the time was the disappearance of 18-year-old Bennington College sophomore Paula Jean Welden, of Stamford, Connecticut, (elder daughter of industrial designer William Archibald Welden of the Revere Copper and Brass Company). On the afternoon of Sunday, December 1, 1946, she set out on a hike by herself on the Long Trail from Woodford Hollow heading northbound in the direction of Glastenbury Mountain. Despite repeated and extensive searches of the area by local police, the National Guard and many volunteers, nothing was ever found. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance.

Crime novelist Hillary Waugh based his book &quot;Last Seen Wearing&quot; on the Welden case.

<text>Microcosmodon is a mammal genus from the Paleocene of North America. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata, and lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Microcosmodontidae. The genus &quot;Microcosmodon&quot; was named by G.L. Jepsen in 1930.

== Species ==
The species Microcosmodon arcuatus was named by P.A. Johnston and R.C. Fox in 1984. Fossil remains have been found in the Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata Rav W-1 of Saskatchewan, Canada. The holotype is in the University of Alberta collection. When alive, the creature weighed about the same as a well-fed mouse (about 30 g).

The type species Microcosmodon conus was named by G.L. Jepsen in 1930. Remains have been found in the Tiffanian (Paleocene)-age strata of the Polecat Bench Formation of Wyoming (United States) and Saskatchewan, Canada. This species would have weighed around 15 g.

The species Microcosmodon harleyi was named by A. Weil in 1998. Remains have been found in the Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata of the Tullock Formation in Montana (USA). &quot;The presence of the new species suggests that microcosmodontine species richness in the Western Interior was as high at the beginning of the Paleocene as at its end,&quot; (Weil, 1998). The species would have weighed about 20 g.

The species Microcosmodon rosei was named by D.W. Krause in 1980. Remains have been found in the Clarforkian (Paleocene)-age strata of the Willwood Formation of Wyoming. This species weighed a fairly standard mouse-sized 25 g+.

The species Microcosmodon woodi was named by R.C. Holtzman and D.L. Wolberg in 1977. It is also known as &quot;Eucosmodontid woodi&quot; (Weil 1998). Remains have been found in the Middle Paleocene-age strata of Montana and North Dakota (USA) and Alberta, Canada. However, Weil A. (1998) found that this material &quot;does not belong to this genus or subfamily.&quot;

<text>The Ice Age Trail is a National Scenic Trail stretching in the state of Wisconsin in the United States. The trail is administered by the National Park Service, and is constructed and maintained by private and public agencies including the Ice Age Trail Alliance, a non-profit and member-volunteer based organization with local chapters. It became an official unit of the National Park System in 2023.

==Route==
The trail roughly follows the location of the terminal moraine from the last Ice Age. As the route traverses the moraine, it sometimes meanders into areas west of the moraine, including the Driftless Area in southwestern Wisconsin. The trail passes through 30 of Wisconsin&#x27;s 72 counties, from the northwestern part of the state to the Lake Michigan shoreline in the east. The western end of the trail is at Interstate State Park along the St. Croix River, which is the border between northwestern Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota. The eastern terminus of the Ice Age Trail lies at Potawatomi State Park, on Wisconsin&#x27;s Door Peninsula near the city of Sturgeon Bay.

Along its route, the trail crosses numerous city and county parks, state parks and forests, state wildlife and natural areas, and the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. The trail often coincides with other trails within various county and municipal parks. It passes through the land of various owners, including the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Ice Age Trail Alliance, and hundreds of private citizens.

As of 2014, the trail was long. At one point, the trail separates into two just north of Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park. The western portion of trail, in length, is referred to as the Western Bifurcation. The Western Bifurcation consists mostly of proposed trail sections (though several miles of established trail do exist). The Western Bifurcation is rejoined by its 75-mile eastern counterpart near the town of Coloma. Though the eastern portion of the trail is more readily developed than its western counterpart, both are officially recognized portions of the Ice Age Trail. As of 2008, the trail consisted of of traditional hiking paths, of multi-use trails, and of connecting roads and sidewalks. As of October 2020, is completed with over connected by connecting routes (usually roads).

The Ice Age Trail has one of a few National Side Trails, the Timms Hill National Trail. National Side Trails are national trails established by the National Trails System Act. The ten-mile Timms Hill Trail connects the Ice Age Trail with Timms Hill, Wisconsin&#x27;s highest point, which is located in Price County.

==History==
The Ice Age Trail began as conservationist Ray Zillmer&#x27;s idea for having an &quot;Ice Age National Park&quot; of 500 miles starting at St. Croix Falls, going south through Madison, northeast through the Kettle Moraine areas ending near Sturgeon Bay. The park would travel through the terminal moraine of the most recent glacier to push through Wisconsin about 10,000 years ago. He envisioned that the park would protect features like kames, drumlins, and kettle moraines. In 1958, Zillmer founded the Ice Age Park &amp; Trail Foundation (now the Ice Age Trail Alliance (IATA)). In a 1959 interview in Wisconsin Alumnus magazine, he was quoted &quot;This land must be purchased soon, before the population explosion following the opening of the St. Lawrence waterways affects Wisconsin, before the hills are pre-empted by private homes and the land becomes too expensive.&quot; Zillmer died in December 1960 and the National Park Service decided in 1961 that a long park was not feasible. In 1964, Wisconsin congressman Henry S. Reuss sponsored the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve bill; the bill was signed to establish nine units which he hoped would be connected by a trail (six were utilized). In 1968, Wisconsin U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson co-sponsored the National Trails System Act which established the Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail. During the summer of 1974, Reuss’ Legislative Assistant James H. Rathlesberger led a team of three Reuss staff routing the trail across Wisconsin. 

It was established by Act of Congress in 1980, in large part as a result of the efforts of Reuss, who in 1976 authored the book &quot;On the Trail of the Ice Age.&quot; The first person to backpack the entire length of the Ice Age Trail was 20-year-old James J. Staudacher of Shorewood, Wisconsin during the summer of 1979. He started at Potawatomi State Park in May 1979. Staudacher received maps with the proposed route and supply packages from Reuss and completed the walk at St. Croix Falls in August. Portions of the trail used existing trails in the northern unit of Kettle Moraine State Forest.

In 2023, the National Park Service recognized the trail as a unit of the National Park Service. Two other national scenic trails also became the country’s newest units of the National Park Service.

==Use==
The trail is open primarily to hiking, although other activities are allowed where the trail follows other existing routes. The trail received an estimated annual usage of 2.3 million people from a 2019 survey. The trail is divided into just over one hundred segments. These segments range in length between about one and 16 miles. Though segmented, in many places along the way, coming out of the woods at the end of one segment simply means crossing the road and re-entering the woods alongside the sign welcoming you to the next.

There are numerous opportunities for longer-distance treks, with camping opportunities including shelters in both units of the Kettle Moraine State Forest. More recently, the Trail Alliance has developed several DCAs (distributed camping areas) spaced as to encourage more overnight backpacking treks--22 such areas exist today (as of January 2023). On the northwestern third of the trail, tent camping is allowed in some areas (particularly in Lincoln and Langlade Counties) provided tents are placed at least 200 feet from the trail.

As of 2020, there are 19 local IATA chapters which are trying to turn connecting routes into permanent segments. The chapters&#x27; biggest obstacle is acquiring land from private owners and permanently protecting it. Several trail chapters offer awards for completing hikes of all segments within their jurisdiction, and the Alliance also has a &quot;cold cache&quot; program to encourage hikers to seek out glacial features along the trail using GPS receivers.

One study of trail users found that those who stay overnight are more likely to camp than use other forms of lodging.

==Sights along the trail==
Primary attractions include topography left by glaciation in the Last Ice Age. Glacial features along the trail include kettles (usually as a kettle lake), potholes, eskers, kames, and glacial erratics. Many of the best examples of glacial features in Wisconsin are exhibited in units of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve, most of which lie along the trail.

Numerous species of mammals can be seen along the trail, including red fox, American red squirrel, white-tailed deer, porcupine, black bear and grey wolf. Birds seen along the southern part of the trail include the Acadian flycatcher, Henslow&#x27;s sparrow, red-headed woodpecker or hooded warbler. In contrast, further north white-throated sparrows, ruffed grouse and bald eagles become more common.

<text>The Cohos Trail is a hiking trail running through northern New Hampshire in the United States, connecting the northern and southern ends of Coos County. It begins at Notchland, near Crawford Notch State Park, and follows a series of trails to the hamlet of Fabyans, then over Cherry Mountain to the town of Jefferson, over Mount Waumbek, along the Kilkenny Ridge Trail to Stark, through Nash Stream Forest to Dixville Notch, and north to the Connecticut Lakes and finally the Canada–US border at the southern edge of Quebec. There it connects with the Sentier Frontalier&#x27;s trail to Mount Megantic and Mount Gosford in Canada.

The final section of the trail was completed in 2011, 33 years after it was first proposed by Kim Nilsen, then a newspaper reporter, who became the trail&#x27;s chief architect.
