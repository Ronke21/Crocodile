<text>Coagulation, also known as clotting, is the process by which blood changes from a liquid to a gel, forming a blood clot. It results in hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, followed by repair. The process of coagulation involves activation, adhesion and aggregation of platelets, as well as deposition and maturation of fibrin.

Coagulation begins almost instantly after an injury to the endothelium that lines a blood vessel. Exposure of blood to the subendothelial space initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial platelet tissue factor to coagulation factor VII, which ultimately leads to cross-linked fibrin formation. Platelets immediately form a plug at the site of injury; this is called &quot;primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis&quot; occurs simultaneously: additional coagulation factors beyond factor VII (listed below) respond in a cascade to form fibrin strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.

Coagulation is highly conserved throughout biology. In all mammals, coagulation involves both cellular components (platelets) and proteinaceous components (coagulation or clotting factors). The pathway in humans has been the most extensively researched and is the best understood. Disorders of coagulation can result in problems with hemorrhage, bruising, or thrombosis.

==List of coagulation factors==
There are 13 traditional clotting factors, as named below, and other substances necessary for coagulation:

==Physiology==

Physiology of blood coagulation is based on hemostasis, the normal bodily process that stops bleeding. Coagulation is a part of an integrated series of haemostatic reactions, involving plasma, platelet, and vascular components.

Hemostasis consists of four main stages:
* Vasoconstriction (vasospasm or vascular spasm): Here, this refers to contraction of smooth muscles in the tunica media layer of endothelium (blood vessel wall).
* Activation of platelets and platelet plug formation:
** Platelet activation: Platelet activators, such as platelet activating factor and thromboxane A2, activate platelets in the bloodstream, leading to attachment of platelets&#x27; membrane receptors (e.g. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) to extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. von Willebrand factor) on cell membranes of damaged endothelial cells and exposed collagen at the site of injury.
** Platelet plug formation: The adhered platelets aggregate and form a temporary plug to stop bleeding. This process is often called &quot;primary hemostasis&quot;.
* Coagulation cascade: It is a series of enzymatic reactions that lead to the formation of a stable blood clot. The endothelial cells release substances like tissue factor, which triggers the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. This is called as &quot;secondary hemostasis&quot;.
* Fibrin clot formation: Near the end of the extrinsic pathway, after thrombin completes conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, factor XIIIa (plasma transglutaminase; activated form of fibrin-stabilizing factor) promotes fibrin cross-linking, and subsequent stabilization of fibrin, leading to the formation of a fibrin clot (final blood clot), which temporarily seals the wound to allow wound healing until its inner part is dissolved by fibrinolytic enzymes, while the clot&#x27;s outer part is shed off.

After the fibrin clot is formed, clot retraction occurs and then clot resolution starts, and these two process are together called &quot;tertiary hemostasis&quot;. Activated platelets contract their internal actin and myosin fibrils in their cytoskeleton, which leads to shrinkage of the clot volume. Plasminogen activators, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), activate plasminogen into plasmin, which promotes lysis of the fibrin clot; this restores the flow of blood in the damaged/obstructed blood vessels.

===Vasoconstriction===

When there is an injury to a blood vessel, the endothelial cells can release various vasoconstrictor substances, such as endothelin and thromboxane, to induce the constriction of the smooth muscles in the vessel wall. This helps reduce blood flow to the site of injury and limits bleeding.

===Platelet activation and platelet plug formation===
When the endothelium is damaged, the normally isolated underlying collagen is exposed to circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets&#x27; glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and A1 domain. This localization of platelets to the extracellular matrix promotes collagen interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI. Binding of collagen to glycoprotein VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate tight binding of platelets to the extracellular matrix. This process adheres platelets to the site of injury.

Activated platelets release the contents of stored granules into the blood plasma. The granules include ADP, serotonin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), vWF, platelet factor 4, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which, in turn, activate additional platelets. The granules&#x27; contents activate a Gq-linked protein receptor cascade, resulting in increased calcium concentration in the platelets&#x27; cytosol. The calcium activates protein kinase C, which, in turn, activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2). PLA2 then modifies the integrin membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, increasing its affinity to bind fibrinogen. The activated platelets change shape from spherical to stellate, and the fibrinogen cross-links with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aid in aggregation of adjacent platelets, forming a platelet plug and thereby completing primary hemostasis).

===Coagulation cascade===


The coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis has two initial pathways which lead to &quot;fibrin&quot; formation. These are the &quot;contact activation pathway&quot; (also known as the intrinsic pathway), and the &quot;tissue factor pathway&quot; (also known as the extrinsic pathway), which both lead to the same fundamental reactions that produce fibrin. It was previously thought that the two pathways of coagulation cascade were of equal importance, but it is now known that the primary pathway for the initiation of blood coagulation is the &quot;tissue factor&quot; (extrinsic) pathway. The pathways are a series of reactions, in which a zymogen (inactive enzyme precursor) of a serine protease and its glycoprotein co-factor are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin. Coagulation factors are generally indicated by Roman numerals, with a lowercase &quot;a&quot; appended to indicate an active form.

The coagulation factors are generally enzymes called serine proteases, which act by cleaving downstream proteins. The exceptions are tissue factor, FV, FVIII, FXIII. Tissue factor, FV and FVIII are glycoproteins, and Factor XIII is a transglutaminase. The coagulation factors circulate as inactive zymogens.
The coagulation cascade is therefore classically divided into three pathways. The &quot;tissue factor&quot; and &quot;contact activation&quot; pathways both activate the &quot;final common pathway&quot; of factor X, thrombin and fibrin.

====Tissue factor pathway (extrinsic)====

The main role of the tissue factor (TF) pathway is to generate a &quot;thrombin burst&quot;, a process by which thrombin, the most important constituent of the coagulation cascade in terms of its feedback activation roles, is released very rapidly. FVIIa circulates in a higher amount than any other activated coagulation factor. The process includes the following steps:

# Following damage to the blood vessel, FVII leaves the circulation and comes into contact with tissue factor expressed on tissue-factor-bearing cells (stromal fibroblasts and leukocytes), forming an activated complex (TF-FVIIa).
# TF-FVIIa activates FIX and FX.
# FVII is itself activated by thrombin, FXIa, FXII, and FXa.
# The activation of FX (to form FXa) by TF-FVIIa is almost immediately inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
# FXa and its co-factor FVa form the prothrombinase complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin.
# Thrombin then activates other components of the coagulation cascade, including FV and FVIII (which forms a complex with FIX), and activates and releases FVIII from being bound to vWF.
# FVIIIa is the co-factor of FIXa, and together they form the &quot;tenase&quot; complex, which activates FX; and so the cycle continues. (&quot;Tenase&quot; is a contraction of &quot;ten&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ase&quot; used for enzymes.)

====Contact activation pathway (intrinsic)====

The contact activation pathway begins with formation of the primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (Hageman factor). Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating blood clot formation (or more specifically, physiological hemostasis) can be illustrated by the fact that individuals with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a bleeding disorder. Instead, contact activation system seems to be more involved in inflammation, and innate immunity. Interference with the pathway may confer protection against thrombosis without a significant bleeding risk.

Inhibition of factor XII and PK interferes with innate immunity in animal models. More promising is inhibition of factor XI, which in early clinical trials have shown the expected effect.

====Final common pathway====

The division of coagulation in two pathways is arbitrary, originating from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured either after the clotting was initiated by glass, the intrinsic pathway; or clotting was initiated by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids), the extrinsic pathway.

Further, the final common pathway scheme implies that prothrombin is converted to thrombin only when acted upon by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, which is an oversimplification. In fact, thrombin is generated by activated platelets at the initiation of the platelet plug, which in turn promotes more platelet activation.

Thrombin functions not only to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, it also activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin). By activating Factor XIII, covalent bonds are formed that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers. This stabilizes the fibrin network.

The coagulation cascade is maintained in a prothrombotic state by the continued activation of FVIII and FIX to form the tenase complex until it is down-regulated by the anticoagulant pathways.

====Cell-based scheme of coagulation====
A newer model of coagulation mechanism explains the intricate combination of cellular and biochemical events that occur during the coagulation process &quot;in vivo&quot;. Along with the procoagulant and anticoagulant plasma proteins, normal physiologic coagulation requires the presence of two cell types for formation of coagulation complexes: cells that express tissue factor (usually extravascular) and platelets.

The coagulation process occurs in two phases. First is the initiation phase, which occurs in tissue-factor-expressing cells. This is followed by the propagation phase, which occurs on activated platelets. The initiation phase, mediated by the tissue factor exposure, proceeds via the classic extrinsic pathway and contributes to about 5% of thrombin production. The amplified production of thrombin occurs via the classic intrinsic pathway in the propagation phase; about 95% of thrombin generated will be during this second phase.

===Fibrinolysis===

Eventually, blood clots are reorganized and resorbed by a process termed &quot;fibrinolysis&quot;. The main enzyme responsible for this process is plasmin, which is regulated by plasmin activators and plasmin inhibitors.

===Role in immune system===
The coagulation system overlaps with the immune system. Coagulation can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some products of the coagulation system can contribute to the innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, an amino acid produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the coagulation system, e.g. coagulase and streptokinase.

Immunohemostasis is the integration of immune activation into adaptive clot formation. Immunothrombosis is the pathological result of crosstalk between immunity, inflammation, and coagulation. Mediators of this process include damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are recognized by toll-like receptors, triggering procoagulant and proinflammatory responses such as formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

===Cofactors===
Various substances are required for the proper functioning of the coagulation cascade:

====Calcium and phospholipids====
Calcium and phospholipids (constituents of platelet membrane) are required for the tenase and prothrombinase complexes to function. Calcium mediates the binding of the complexes via the terminal gamma-carboxy residues on Factor Xa and Factor IXa to the phospholipid surfaces expressed by platelets, as well as procoagulant microparticles or microvesicles shed from them. Calcium is also required at other points in the coagulation cascade. Calcium ions play a major role in the regulation of coagulation cascade that is paramount in the maintenance of hemostasis. Other than platelet activation, calcium ions are responsible for complete activation of several coagulation factors, including coagulation Factor XIII.

====Vitamin K====
Vitamin K is an essential factor to the hepatic gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as Protein S, Protein C and Protein Z. In adding the gamma-carboxyl group to glutamate residues on the immature clotting factors, Vitamin K is itself oxidized. Another enzyme, &quot;Vitamin K epoxide reductase&quot; (VKORC), reduces vitamin K back to its active form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase is pharmacologically important as a target of anticoagulant drugs warfarin and related coumarins such as acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and dicumarol. These drugs create a deficiency of reduced vitamin K by blocking VKORC, thereby inhibiting maturation of clotting factors. Vitamin K deficiency from other causes (e.g., in malabsorption) or impaired vitamin K metabolism in disease (e.g., in liver failure) lead to the formation of PIVKAs (proteins formed in vitamin K absence), which are partially or totally non-gamma carboxylated, affecting the coagulation factors&#x27; ability to bind to phospholipid.

===Regulators===

Several mechanisms keep platelet activation and the coagulation cascade in check. Abnormalities can lead to an increased tendency toward thrombosis:

====Protein C and Protein S====
Protein C is a major physiological anticoagulant. It is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease enzyme that is activated by thrombin into activated protein C (APC). Protein C is activated in a sequence that starts with Protein C and thrombin binding to a cell surface protein thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin binds these proteins in such a way that it activates Protein C. The activated form, along with protein S and a phospholipid as cofactors, degrades FVa and FVIIIa. Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of either (protein C or protein S) may lead to thrombophilia (a tendency to develop thrombosis). Impaired action of Protein C (activated Protein C resistance), for example by having the &quot;Leiden&quot; variant of Factor V or high levels of FVIII, also may lead to a thrombotic tendency.

====Antithrombin====
Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the serine proteases: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased by the presence of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g., in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia.

====Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)====
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) limits the action of tissue factor (TF). It also inhibits excessive TF-mediated activation of FVII and FX.

====Plasmin====
Plasmin is generated by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.

====Prostacyclin====
Prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by endothelium and activates platelet Gs protein-linked receptors. This, in turn, activates adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP. cAMP inhibits platelet activation by decreasing cytosolic levels of calcium and, by doing so, inhibits the release of granules that would lead to activation of additional platelets and the coagulation cascade.

== Medical assessment ==
Numerous medical tests are used to assess the function of the coagulation system:
* Common: aPTT, PT (also used to determine INR), fibrinogen testing (often by the &quot;Clauss fibrinogen assay&quot;), platelet count, platelet function testing (often by PFA-100), thrombodynamics test.
* Other: TCT, bleeding time, mixing test (whether an abnormality corrects if the patient&#x27;s plasma is mixed with normal plasma), coagulation factor assays, antiphospholipid antibodies, D-dimer, genetic tests (e.g. factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A), dilute Russell&#x27;s viper venom time (dRVVT), miscellaneous platelet function tests, thromboelastography (TEG or Sonoclot), euglobulin lysis time (ELT).

The contact activation (intrinsic) pathway is initiated by activation of the contact activation system, and can be measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test.

The tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway is initiated by release of tissue factor (a specific cellular lipoprotein), and can be measured by the prothrombin time (PT) test. PT results are often reported as ratio (INR value) to monitor dosing of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin.

The quantitative and qualitative screening of fibrinogen is measured by the thrombin clotting time (TCT). Measurement of the exact amount of fibrinogen present in the blood is generally done using the &quot;Clauss fibrinogen assay&quot;. Many analysers are capable of measuring a &quot;derived fibrinogen&quot; level from the graph of the Prothrombin time clot.

If a coagulation factor is part of the contact activation or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus hemophilia A, a deficiency of factor VIII, which is part of the contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. Deficiencies of common pathway factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, FX, and FV will prolong both aPTT and PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.

Deficiencies of fibrinogen (quantitative or qualitative) will prolong PT, aPTT, thrombin time, and reptilase time.

==Role in disease==
Coagulation defects may cause hemorrhage or thrombosis, and occasionally both, depending on the nature of the defect.

===Platelet disorders===
Platelet disorders are either congenital or acquired. Examples of congenital platelet disorders are Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia, Bernard–Soulier syndrome (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), gray platelet syndrome (deficient alpha granules), and delta storage pool deficiency (deficient dense granules). Most are rare. They predispose to hemorrhage. Von Willebrand disease is due to deficiency or abnormal function of von Willebrand factor, and leads to a similar bleeding pattern; its milder forms are relatively common.

Decreased platelet numbers (thrombocytopenia) is due to insufficient production (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), or consumption (e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). An increase in platelet count is called thrombocytosis, which may lead to formation of thromboembolisms; however, thrombocytosis may be associated with increased risk of either thrombosis or hemorrhage in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm.

===Coagulation factor disorders===
The best-known coagulation factor disorders are the hemophilias. The three main forms are hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency or &quot;Christmas disease&quot;) and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency, mild bleeding tendency).

Von Willebrand disease (which behaves more like a platelet disorder except in severe cases), is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder and is characterized as being inherited autosomal recessive or dominant. In this disease, there is a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates the binding of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) to collagen. This binding helps mediate the activation of platelets and formation of primary hemostasis.

In acute or chronic liver failure, there is insufficient production of coagulation factors, possibly increasing risk of bleeding during surgery.

Thrombosis is the pathological development of blood clots. These clots may break free and become mobile, forming an embolus or grow to such a size that occludes the vessel in which it developed. An embolism is said to occur when the thrombus (blood clot) becomes a mobile embolus and migrates to another part of the body, interfering with blood circulation and hence impairing organ function downstream of the occlusion. This causes ischemia and often leads to ischemic necrosis of tissue. Most cases of venous thrombosis are due to acquired states (older age, surgery, cancer, immobility). Unprovoked venous thrombosis may be related to inherited thrombophilias (e.g., factor V Leiden, antithrombin deficiency, and various other genetic deficiencies or variants), particularly in younger patients with family history of thrombosis; however, thrombotic events are more likely when acquired risk factors are superimposed on the inherited state.

==Pharmacology==

===Procoagulants===
The use of adsorbent chemicals, such as zeolites, and other hemostatic agents are also used for sealing severe injuries quickly (such as in traumatic bleeding secondary to gunshot wounds). Thrombin and fibrin glue are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms. Hemostatic Powder Spray TC-325 is used to treated gastrointestinal bleeding.

Desmopressin is used to improve platelet function by activating arginine vasopressin receptor 1A.

Coagulation factor concentrates are used to treat hemophilia, to reverse the effects of anticoagulants, and to treat bleeding in people with impaired coagulation factor synthesis or increased consumption. Prothrombin complex concentrate, cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma are commonly used coagulation factor products. Recombinant activated human factor VII is sometimes used in the treatment of major bleeding.

Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid inhibit fibrinolysis and lead to a &quot;de facto&quot; reduced bleeding rate. Before its withdrawal, aprotinin was used in some forms of major surgery to decrease bleeding risk and the need for blood products.

===Anticoagulants===
Anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents (together &quot;antithrombotics&quot;) are amongst the most commonly used medications. Anti-platelet agents include aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; the parenteral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used during angioplasty. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are the most commonly used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on thrombin and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the direct thrombin inhibitors, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin and dabigatran). Also in clinical use are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (the directly acting oral anticoagulants: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban).

==History==

===Initial discoveries===
Theories on the coagulation of blood have existed since antiquity. Physiologist Johannes Müller (1801–1858) described fibrin, the substance of a thrombus. Its soluble precursor, fibrinogen, was thus named by Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), and isolated chemically by Prosper Sylvain Denis (1799–1863). Alexander Schmidt suggested that the conversion from fibrinogen to fibrin is the result of an enzymatic process, and labeled the hypothetical enzyme &quot;thrombin&quot; and its precursor &quot;prothrombin&quot;. Arthus discovered in 1890 that calcium was essential in coagulation. Platelets were identified in 1865, and their function was elucidated by Giulio Bizzozero in 1882.

The theory that thrombin is generated by the presence of tissue factor was consolidated by Paul Morawitz in 1905. At this stage, it was known that &quot;thrombokinase/thromboplastin&quot; (factor III) is released by damaged tissues, reacting with &quot;prothrombin&quot; (II), which, together with calcium (IV), forms &quot;thrombin&quot;, which converts fibrinogen into &quot;fibrin&quot; (I).

===Coagulation factors===
The remainder of the biochemical factors in the process of coagulation were largely discovered in the 20th century.

A first clue as to the actual complexity of the system of coagulation was the discovery of &quot;proaccelerin&quot; (initially and later called Factor V) by (1905–1990) in 1947. He also postulated its function to be the generation of accelerin (Factor VI), which later turned out to be the activated form of V (or Va); hence, VI is not now in active use.

Factor VII (also known as &quot;serum prothrombin conversion accelerator&quot; or &quot;proconvertin&quot;, precipitated by barium sulfate) was discovered in a young female patient in 1949 and 1951 by different groups.

Factor VIII turned out to be deficient in the clinically recognized but etiologically elusive hemophilia A; it was identified in the 1950s and is alternatively called &quot;antihemophilic globulin&quot; due to its capability to correct hemophilia A.

Factor IX was discovered in 1952 in a young patient with hemophilia B named Stephen Christmas (1947–1993). His deficiency was described by Dr. Rosemary Biggs and Professor R.G. MacFarlane in Oxford, UK. The factor is, hence, called Christmas Factor. Christmas lived in Canada and campaigned for blood transfusion safety until succumbing to transfusion-related AIDS at age 46. An alternative name for the factor is &quot;plasma thromboplastin component&quot;, given by an independent group in California.

Hageman factor, now known as factor XII, was identified in 1955 in an asymptomatic patient with a prolonged bleeding time named of John Hageman. Factor X, or Stuart-Prower factor, followed, in 1956. This protein was identified in a Ms. Audrey Prower of London, who had a lifelong bleeding tendency. In 1957, an American group identified the same factor in a Mr. Rufus Stuart. Factors XI and XIII were identified in 1953 and 1961, respectively.

The view that the coagulation process is a &quot;cascade&quot; or &quot;waterfall&quot; was enunciated almost simultaneously by MacFarlane in the UK and by Davie and Ratnoff in the US, respectively.

===Nomenclature===
The usage of Roman numerals rather than eponyms or systematic names was agreed upon during annual conferences (starting in 1955) of hemostasis experts. In 1962, consensus was achieved on the numbering of factors I–XII. This committee evolved into the present-day International Committee on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ICTH). Assignment of numerals ceased in 1963 after the naming of Factor XIII. The names Fletcher Factor and Fitzgerald Factor were given to further coagulation-related proteins, namely prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen, respectively.

Factor VI is unassigned, as accelerin was found to be activated Factor V.

==Other species==
All mammals have an extremely closely related blood coagulation process, using a combined cellular and serine protease process. It is possible for any mammalian coagulation factor to &quot;cleave&quot; its equivalent target in any other mammal. The only non-mammalian animal known to use serine proteases for blood coagulation is the horseshoe crab. Exemplifying the close links between coagulation and inflammation, the horseshoe crab has a primitive response to injury, carried out by cells known as amoebocytes (or hemocytes) which serve both hemostatic and immune functions.

<text>Stephen Anthony James Duffy (born 30 May 1960 in Alum Rock, Warwickshire, England), also known as Tin Tin, is an English musician, singer, and songwriter of Irish ancestry. He was a founding member, vocalist, bassist, and then drummer of Duran Duran. He went on to record as a solo performer under several different names, and is the singer and songwriter for The Lilac Time with his elder brother Nick. He has also co-written with Robbie Williams and Steven Page.

==Career==

===Duran Duran and other early work===
While attending the School of Foundation Studies &amp; Experimental Workshop at Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University), Duffy met John Taylor. Together, along with Taylor&#x27;s childhood friend Nick Rhodes, they formed the group Duran Duran. While Taylor was the guitarist (later switching to bass) and Rhodes played the synthesizer, Duffy was the band&#x27;s vocalist/lyricist and bassist. When bass player Simon Colley joined, Duffy moved to drums. He left both the school and the band in 1979, before Duran Duran signed with EMI in 1980.

He went on to form Obviously Five Believers, sometimes known as The Subterranean Hawks or The Hawks, and he made his first four-track recordings. The Hawks&#x27; only single, &quot;Words of Hope&quot;, was released in 1981.

===Tin Tin===
In 1982, he created the band Tin Tin, with John Mulligan and Dik Davis (both then of Fashion), Andy &quot;Stoker&quot; Growcott (of Dexys Midnight Runners) and Bob Lamb (original producer of Birmingham band UB40). Originally called Holy Tin Tin before being shortened, the band were signed with WEA Records in the UK, and released the single &quot;Kiss Me&quot; in 1982, but this was unsuccessful. By 1983, Tin Tin had signed with Sire Records in the US, and &quot;Kiss Me&quot; hit the dance charts there. Another single, &quot;Hold It&quot;, was also released in 1983, and peaked at no. 55 in the UK.

After a stint of working in the US, Duffy returned to England and signed a deal as a solo artist with Virgin 10. Now working under the name Stephen &quot;Tin Tin&quot; Duffy, he recorded a new version of &quot;Kiss Me&quot; which was released in 1984, this time only in the local West Midlands area, followed by a nationwide release of &quot;She Makes Me Quiver&quot; which peaked at no. 88 in September 1984. At the end of 1984, Duffy recorded a third version of &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, produced by J.J. Jeczalik and Nicholas Froome, which was released in February 1985. It debuted at no. 22 and peaked at no. 4 in the UK and stayed in the Top 10 for five weeks. Duffy followed it with the single &quot;Icing on the Cake&quot;, which peaked at no. 14 in June 1985.

Duffy&#x27;s first full album, &quot;The Ups and Downs&quot; (produced by Duffy, Froome, Jeczalik, Booker T. Jones, and Stephen Street), reached number 35 in the UK. Prior to the release of &quot;The Ups And Downs&quot;, Stephen Duffy and his brother Nick formed their own design office called &quot;DUFFY and DUFFY&quot;. For the album&#x27;s preview release, they had an exhibition of about 80 paintings, drawings, photographs, and video.

A new single, &quot;Unkiss That Kiss&quot;, was released in September 1985 and peaked at no. 77 in the UK. For this single, Duffy had become known as Stephen A.J. Duffy after dropping the &quot;Tin Tin&quot; reference from his stage name. The single was the first to be taken from the album &quot;Because We Love You&quot;, released in early 1986, for which he was credited simply as Stephen Duffy. Additional singles from the album were &quot;I Love You&quot; (which peaked at no. 86) and &quot;Something Special&quot; which was a collaboration with Sandii (of Sandii &amp; the Sunsetz); however, this single (and the album itself) failed to chart.

===Dr. Calculus===
Duffy also recorded a non-stop forty-minute early chill-out / house album in 1986 called &quot;Designer Beatnik&quot; with Roger Freeman of Pigbag, released under the name Dr. Calculus mdma. The cover photo shows the &quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; Rolls-Royce car mascot and the album&#x27;s two singles were &quot;Programme 7&quot; and &quot;Perfume from Spain&quot;.

===The Lilac Time===

In 1986, Duffy began writing and recording music that would become The Lilac Time&#x27;s first album, released on Swordfish Records. The album, entitled &quot;The Lilac Time&quot;, came out in November 1987, and was subsequently reissued in remixed form by Fontana on 8 February 1988.

The Lilac Time have gone through various line-up changes with the Duffy brothers as mainstays. The group originally consisted of Stephen Duffy, his elder brother Nick Duffy, and friend Michael Weston, who recorded the first album together; Michael Giri and Fraser Kent joined when the band was ready to go on tour. The Lilac Time put out the albums &quot;Paradise Circus&quot; in 1989 and &quot;&amp; Love For All&quot; in 1990 for Fontana before being dropped.

The group were then briefly signed to Creation Records, and were subsequently managed by label head, Alan McGee. Their sole release on Creation was &quot;Astronauts&quot; in 1991.

In 1991, the band split up (temporarily, as it turned out) and Duffy subsequently pursued a solo career.

===Solo===
The 1993 Stephen Duffy album &quot;Music in Colors&quot; (Parlophone) was recorded with Nigel Kennedy, and featured the singles &quot;Natalie&quot; and &quot;Holte End Hotel&quot;.

The next album was called simply &quot;Duffy&quot;, released in August 1995 on Indolent Records. &quot;London Girls&quot; and &quot;Sugar High&quot; went to the top 10 on the UK indie chart. (&quot;Starfit&quot; was also released as a single in the US.) The album was reissued on CD in 2000 by BMG Fun House.

He participated in a temporary supergroup called Me Me Me, consisting of Duffy, Alex James of Blur, Justin Welch of Elastica, and Charlie Bloor. The one-off single, &quot;Hanging Around&quot;, was released 5 August 1996, and reached Number 19 on the UK chart.

&quot;I Love My Friends&quot; was released in 1998 by Cooking Vinyl Records, who also released the singles &quot;17&quot; and &quot;You Are&quot;.

Virgin released a compilation album entitled &quot;They Called Him Tin Tin&quot; in 1999.

===The Devils===
In 1999, Duffy found a tape recording of 1978–1979 Duran Duran music that was in storage. Shortly afterwards, he had a chance meeting with Nick Rhodes. Reminiscences led to a desire to collaborate, and they ended up re-recording the music on the tape. They did not change any of the lyrics, and used only late-70s-era instrumentation with modern recording techniques. The result was the album &quot;Dark Circles&quot;, released under the name The Devils.

===Return to The Lilac Time===
Duffy reformed The Lilac Time with brother Nick and Michael Giri, along with new members Claire Worrall and Melvin Duffy (no relation). They released &quot;Looking for a Day in the Night&quot; in 1999 on spinART Records, and &quot;lilac6&quot; on Cooking Vinyl in 2001. &quot;Compendium – The Fontana Trinity&quot;, a collection of tracks from their singles and first three albums was also released in 2001.

The album &quot;Keep Going&quot; was released in 2003 on Folk Modern records under the name &#x27;Stephen Duffy &amp; The Lilac Time&#x27;.

In 2007, Duffy released a new album and limited edition (2000 copies) book called &quot;Runout Groove&quot; and held a few rare performances with the full Lilac Time ensemble, notably headlining the Green Man Festival.

===Work with Robbie Williams and Steven Page===
In 1987, Duffy was contacted by Steven Page, then of the band Scary Movie Breakfast, and was impressed by his writing and demo tape. Duffy and Page began co-writing songs. Their work together produced popular Barenaked Ladies songs like &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Alcohol&quot; and &quot;Call and Answer&quot;; the final two included on the platinum-selling album &quot;Stunt&quot;, as well as material on Page&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Vanity Project&quot;.

Duffy&#x27;s songwriting ability earned him his first Number 1 in October 2004, as the co-writer of the Robbie Williams single &quot;Radio&quot;, one of two new tracks recorded for Williams&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.

In October 2005, Robbie Williams released &quot;Intensive Care&quot;, fully co-written and co-produced by Stephen Duffy. The album gained him a great deal of exposure, critical acclaim and went on to sell over eight million copies becoming Williams&#x27; best selling studio album around the world. Duffy then went on to work as the musical director for Williams&#x27; Close Encounters World Tour.

===Film documentary===
The Douglas Arrowsmith documentary &quot;Memory &amp; Desire: 30 Years in the Wilderness with Stephen Duffy &amp; the Lilac Time&quot; was filmed over six years and includes vintage footage of the band. The film was released at the London Raindance Film Festival in October 2009, accompanied by a Universal Records album of the same name, bringing together songs from Duffy&#x27;s thirty years of music making.It was not picked up for general distribution however and was withdrawn to be re-edited to include live footage. As of 2022, it is no longer titled Memory &amp; Desire and it is described as an ongoing project.

Duffy agreed to a request to sit by sculptor Jon Edgar in London in 2008. The terracotta work was coincidentally documented during the filming of the Douglas Arrowsmith documentary &quot;Memory and Desire&quot;. An image appears on the CD cover for the &quot;Memory and Desire&quot; (2009) album.

===Later work===
In 2021, an album by The Hawks called &quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot; arrived more than 40 years after their single &quot;Words Of Hope&quot;, with the project overseen by Duffy, drummer Dave Twist and producer John Paterno. The album came about after Duffy got heckled by the band&#x27;s guitarist Dave Kusworth (also formerly of The Dogs D&#x27;Amour and Jacobites) at an event at Birmingham&#x27;s Glee Club in 2019, with the album being released by Easy Action Records, almost a year after the death of Kusworth.

<text>Meetup is a social media platform for hosting and organizing in-person and virtual activities, gatherings, and events for people and communities of similar interests, hobbies, and professions. It was founded in 2002 by Scott Heiferman and four others. The company was acquired by WeWork in 2017 and remains headquartered in New York City. WeWork sold it to AlleyCorp, an early stage NY-focused venture fund and incubator, in March 2020. In January 2024, Bending Spoons acquired Meetup. After the acquisition, Meetup introduced a free tier and changed the pricing structure of its paid tiers.

==History==
Meetup was founded in June 2002 by Scott Heiferman and four co-founders. The idea for Meetup came from Heiferman meeting his neighbors in New York City for the first time after the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers. Heiferman was also influenced by the book Bowling Alone, which is about the deterioration of community in American culture. Some initial funding for the venture was raised from friends and family, which was followed by a funding round with angel investors.

The early version of Meetup generated revenues by charging a fee to venues in exchange for bringing Meetup users to their business. Once enough users added themselves to a group, Meetup would send the group members an email, asking them to vote on one of three sponsoring venues for the group to meet at. Within a few months of Meetup launching, 56,000 users had joined the site. In 2003 Meetup won the &quot;Community Websites and Mobile Site&quot; Webby Award.

Meetup was originally intended to focus on hobbies and interests, but it was popularized by Presidential hopeful Howard Dean in 2004. Meetup developed paid services to help the Dean campaign to meet with Meetup users. Dean also publicized Meetup groups of supporters in his speeches and on his website. At the peak of Dean&#x27;s campaign, 143,000 users had joined Meetup groups for Dean supporters. Afterwards, Meetup became a routine part of internet campaigning for American politicians.

In early 2005, Meetup began to charge a fee for group organizers. Initially, changes to the website had to be approved by two committees. In 2009, Meetup started running hackathons, where employees came up with new features that would be implemented if their coworkers supported it. The website was redesigned in 2013. Meetup had 8 million users in 2010, and 25.5 million users by 2013.

In 2013, Meetup acquired a struggling email collaboration company called Dispatch. In 2014, a hacker shut down Meetup with a DDoS attack, the hacker claimed to be funded by a competitor. In 2017, Meetup created 1,000 #resist Meetup groups with the intention of coordinating protests in response to the Trump travel ban. This caused some Trump supporters to leave the site or call for a boycott. Meetup also partnered with a labor group to organize anti-Trump protests.

Meetup was acquired by WeWork in late 2017 for about $156 million. Some former employees said there was a 10% layoff after the acquisition. In 2018, Scott Heiferman stepped down as CEO and former Investopedia CEO David Siegel took his place. Heiferman became Chairman of the company. In October 2019, Meetup began to test a different pricing model in two US states, reducing the costs that must be paid by organizers of $23.99/month or $98.94/six months, but requiring users to pay a $2 fee in order to RSVP for events, leaving several users angry. In March 2020, WeWork sold Meetup to AlleyCorp and other investors, reportedly at a substantial loss. The deal added AlleyCorp&#x27;s Kevin P. Ryan onto Meetup&#x27;s board. In January 2024, Bending Spoons acquired Meetup.

==Services==
Meetup is an online service used to create groups that host local in-person and virtual events. As of 2017, there are about 35 million Meetup users. Each user can be a member of multiple groups or RSVP for any number of events. Users are usually using the website to find friends, share a hobby, or for professional networking. Meetup users do not have &quot;followers&quot; or other direct connections with each other like on other social media sites.

Meetup users self-organize into groups. As of 2017, there are about 225,000 Meetup groups in 180 countries. Each group has a different topic, size, and rules. Groups are associated with one of 30+ categories and any number of more than 18,000 tags that identify the group&#x27;s theme. The most popular categories are &quot;adventure and outdoor activities, career and business, and parents and family.&quot; Most events are on a structured schedule each week or month at a local venue, typically on evenings or weekends, though more and more events are being held virtually with a pivot to allowing online events as a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Between March and October 2020, Meetup had hosted more than one million online events.

Meetup groups are run by approximately 140,000 organizers. Any Meetup user can be an organizer. Organizers set up groups, organize events, and develop event content. They also pay a fee to run the group, under the expectation of sharing the cost with members that attend events. Meetup has policies against organizing meetups around a commercial interest that are not compatible with their usage policies, hate speech, or groups that do not meet in-person. Their policy regarding commercial activities has generated some confusion with some claiming that no commercial activities are allowed, even going so far as to claim that a free event that has a sponsor for food and drinks is against Meetup&#x27;s policies. But purely commercial activities are allowed in their policy, as long as they are, in essence, a Meetup style activity. That is, a winery could organize a wine tasting event through Meetup charging commercial rates, but not use Meetup to simply promote their wines or only sales portal.

<text>Bernd Behr (born 1976) is a Taiwanese artist based in London.

==Biography==
Born in Hamburg in 1976 and raised in Malaysia, Behr studied at San José State University, California and Goldsmiths, University of London, London.

Behr was shortlisted for the 2003 Beck&#x27;s Futures prize at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. His work can be seen as a cultural archaeology of sites and events which share confluent histories of art, cinema and the built environment. He works across video, photography and sculpture to explore a dialogue between documentary and constructed approaches to his subjects and the associative, sometimes fictional, histories that emerge from them.

Behr currently teaches on the BA (Hons) Photography course at Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts London.

<doc id="212204" wikidata="Q3050859" url="?curid=212204" title="United Way">
<text>United Way is an international network of over 1,800 local nonprofit fundraising affiliates. Prior to 2015, United Way was the largest nonprofit organization in the United States by donations from the public. Individual United Ways mobilize a single fundraising campaign to raise money for various nonprofits, with most donations coming through payroll deductions.

== United Way Worldwide ==
United Way organizations raise funds primarily via workplace campaigns, where employers may solicit contributions on United Way&#x27;s behalf payable through automatic payroll deductions. After an administrative fee is deducted, funds raised locally by United Way are then distributed to various nonprofit agencies within those communities. Major recipients have included the American Cancer Society, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Catholic Charities, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and The Salvation Army.

Membership in United Way and use of the United Way brand is overseen by the United Way Worldwide umbrella organization. United Way Worldwide is not a top-down organization that has ownership of local United Ways. Instead, each local United Way is run as independently and incorporated separately as a 501(c)(3) organization. Each affiliate is led by local staff and volunteers and have their own board of directors, independent of United Way Worldwide or a parent organization. Some United Way affiliates, like the Central Community Chest of Japan, choose not to use the United Way name and branding.

Local United Ways pay membership dues to United Way Worldwide for licensing rights to the United Way brand and must meet criteria to maintain their membership status (including independent review boards, audits, and restrictions on marketing tactics). The membership dues to United Way Worldwide are a portion of the total funds raised by each local United Way. U.S. affiliates pay a membership fee of 1% of their total funds raised to United Way Worldwide. The structure has been described as similar to a &quot;global franchise operation&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

Internally, United Ways are classified by how much funds they raise on a scale of 10 levels. &quot;Metro 1&quot; is the highest-ranking which requires raising at least $9 million annually.

== Functions ==
United Ways are &quot;federated fundraising bodies&quot; that mobilize a single fundraising campaign to raise money for a diverse range of nonprofits. United Ways raise funds and determine how to best distribute them.

=== Fundraising ===

United Ways raise funds primarily via company-sanctioned workplace campaigns, where the employer solicits contributions from their employees that can be paid through automatic payroll deductions (in the same way tax withholdings and insurance premiums are deducted from an employee&#x27;s net pay). 57% of United Way&#x27;s donations come through payroll deductions while an additional 20% from corporate donations.

United Way also administers many of the annual workplace campaigns for federal employees in the US called the Combined Federal Campaign.

Nonprofit agencies that partner with United Way usually agree not to fundraise while the United Way campaigns are underway.

===Distributing funds===
Money raised by local United Ways is distributed to local nonprofit agencies after an administrative cost is deducted. In 2002, the average administrative fee was 12.7%. Where United Way distributes the funds depends on if the donor designated or restricted their donation to a specific organization or cause.

====Designated donations (donor-choice)====
Almost all United Ways allow donors to specify (designate) which nonprofits should receive their funds. Some United Ways let donors choose which focus area or social problems (like helping kids or the elderly) they wish to support, which allocates their gift to a relevant subset of their charities in its network. Some United Ways allow donors to direct their gifts to any nonprofit (either inside or outside United Way&#x27;s preferred charity list) while some only let donors give to any charity in their region or anywhere in the country.

About a quarter of United Way donations in the US are currently designated.

====Undesignated donations====
If the donor does not earmark a specific cause or organization for their donation, the money goes into a general fund and are allocated to areas of greatest need by the local United Way&#x27;s volunteer committee.

Traditionally, United Ways would grant funds that can be used for any purpose by the recipient nonprofit. However, many United Ways have started giving funds to nonprofits only to be used for specific programs run by the nonprofit (e.g. a workforce training program at the local chapter of St Vincent de Paul). These funds are provided in the form of contracts in which the nonprofit must deliver programs and are subject to review and audit by the United Way&#x27;s volunteer committee.

==History==
===Origins in the Community Chest movement===

The organization has roots in Denver, Colorado, where in 1887 Frances Wisebart Jacobs, along with the Rev. Myron W. Reed, Msgr. William J. O&#x27;Ryan, Dean H. Martyn Hart and Rabbi William S. Friedman began the Charity Organization Society, which coordinated services between Jewish and Christian charities and fundraising for 22 agencies. Many Community Chest organizations, which were founded in the first half of the twentieth century to jointly collect and allocate money, joined the American Association for Community Organizations in 1918.

The first Community Chest was founded in 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio, after the example of the Jewish Federation in Cleveland—which served as an exemplary model for &quot;federated giving&quot;.

The success of the Cleveland Community Chest led to a modest spread of the concept to other cities. World War I helped disseminate the concept of the Community Chest as the model for federating giving was used to support wartime fundraising efforts. Of the 300–400 War Chests that existed during the war, most converted over to becoming Community Chests after the war ended.

The number of Community Chest organizations quickly increased from 245 in 1925 to almost 800 by 1945. An observer on WWI&#x27;s effects on the movement said, &quot;there is no doubt that the federation movement gained a momentum in one year that would have required ten years of peacetime activity.&quot; Mirroring the changing terminology, the American Association for Community Organization changed its name to the Community Chests and Councils, Inc in 1927.

===Further consolidation into United Funds===
World War II also impacted the Community Chest movement. National health research charities, like the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society, gained government support during the war. These health agencies used their centralized headquarters and nationwide fundraising reach to run separate and competing local fundraising campaigns alongside the Community Chests.
The competing appeals between the health organizations and Community Chests resulted in exhausting and disorganized situations. Business leaders were concerned that the barrage of donation drives in the workplace would reduce productivity. The Ford Company issued a well-publicized press release stating that the automaker lost $40,000 in executive time and employee productivity with each plant solicitation. A committee at Ford led by Henry Ford II told charities to &quot;federate or perish. We&#x27;ll contribute to charity once a year or not at all.&quot;
This outgrowth of objections from business and labor leaders led to the formation of the first United Fund in 1949 in Detroit, Michigan. Under the motto of &quot;Give Once for All&quot;, the United Foundation hosted a single campaign that included Community Chests, local charities, and some of the national charities. This first campaign in Detroit was a success and had raised more in the single campaign than the disparate efforts has yielded the year prior. The single workplace campaign model quick spread elsewhere and, by 1953, there were over 1,200 United Funds.

These campaigns, which &quot;united&quot; Community Chests with other organizations, commonly used the &quot;United&quot; prefix in their names. In 1956, &quot;Community Chests and Councils, Inc.&quot; changed its name again to United Community Funds and Councils of America (UCFCA) to reflect the shifting naming used by its affiliates.
The &quot;big three&quot; national health drives (the American Cancer Society, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and the American Red Cross) objected to handing over control of their fundraising efforts and refused to participate in a single workplace drive. The focus of local community fundraising also conflicted with the mission of the national health organizations. Many United Funds supported health causes locally, with funds going to charities in their local communities. By the late 1960s, the conflicts between United Funds and national health charities resolved itself with many of the charities folding into the United Fund or retreating from competing.

===Formation of the United Way===
After WWII, the United Fund took a similar role to the modern United Way. They focused almost exclusively on workplace fundraising (rather than the Community Chests&#x27; focus on door-to-door solicitations). The end of the excess profit taxes weakened the incentives for corporate gifts after World War II. Campaign leaders looked to employees in workplace (and not their bosses) as an opportunity to make up for the expected loss. In 1956, workplace giving from employees accounted for 39.6% of the revenue of United Funds and Community Chests. This was the first time that workplace giving exceeded corporate gifts (38%). With federal government&#x27;s move to allow compulsory Social Security and income tax withholdings in 1942, the technology of payroll deductions became a vehicle to allow employees to give incremental gifts. The strong economy in post-war economic boom helped these campaigns to grow at a rate of 5–10% annually.
&quot;United Community Funds and Council of America,&quot; the national association of United Funds, expanded its role in the 1970s. Historically, it served a similar role as a trade association to the United Funds and lacked authority in shaping their affiliates. Its thousands of affiliates went by no fewer than 137 different names and pursued thousands of different charitable objectives.


To give the organization a national identity, the United Community Funds and Council of America adopted a new name and logo. The organization announced on July 13, 1970, that it would change its name from &quot;United Funds and Council of America&quot; to United Way of America. Bayard Ewing, the president of the fund said: &quot;We wanted a simple name that would give people a clearer and more descriptive idea of what our organization is trying to do. I hope that the name will be adopted by all of our 2,260 fund‐raising units throughout the country.&quot; The new logo was designed by graphic designer Saul Bass in 1972. Aramony traveled to major cities to persuade the affiliates to adopt the logo and brand name.

It moved from New York City to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971.

In 1973, United Way of America formed a partnership with the National Football League.

By 1974, there were enough United Way organizations internationally to demand the kind of support provided by the national organization, United Way of America, and United Way International was born. Its staff spoke eight languages, with a Board of Directors from more than seven countries working with member organizations. Christopher Amundsen served as interim president during a yearlong search.

=== Competing with alternative funds ===
United Way faced competition from competing federations (called &quot;alternative funds&quot;) that focused on a narrower set of issues that resonate strongly with donors, including championing controversial issues have excluded from United Way funding or that do not appeal to United Way&#x27;s predominantly male, white, corporate membership. These alternative funds challenged the central thesis of the United Way model – that one umbrella organization can serve both the donors&#x27; interests and community&#x27;s needs. The competition for access to the workplace giving was called the &quot;Charity War&quot; among professional fundraisers at the time.

Some United Ways fought against the additions to alternative funds out of fear that nonprofits will suffer when faced with competition and that the multiple donation appeals would cause confusion. United Way of Los Angeles President Leo Cornelius said of alternative funds for a 1989 Los Angeles Times article, &quot;There should be one campaign at the workplace, for the donor&#x27;s sake. Otherwise, it&#x27;s like watching four or five or 15 TV screens at one time.&quot; In one case, a delegation from the Bay Area United Way phoned the chairman of the Safeway supermarket chain to lobby against the addition alternative funds in their workplace campaigns in 1988. Apple Inc. was the first Fortune 500 company to allow a federation other than United Way into its workplace.

Private workplaces began to open access to non-United Way workplace campaigns in the mid-1990s, with the trend growing throughout the next decade. Four federations (America&#x27;s Charities, Community Health Charities, EarthShare, and Global Impact) formed the Charities@Work coalition promoted expanding access to workplace campaigns. Due to the competitive philanthropic environment, United Ways has lost market share. In 1988, there were 450,000 nonprofits in US and United Way share&#x27;s of US charitable contributions was 3.16%; by 1999, there were 715,000 nonprofits, and the United Way&#x27;s share decreased to only 1.98% of donations. The trend of alternative funds continues to today with only 25 percent of the companies conducting a traditional United Way–only campaign (according to a 2009 survey by the Consulting Network).

=== The Aramony scandal and its aftermath ===

In January 1990, an anonymous tipster sent a note on United Way of America letterhead to several United Way directors, including the board chairman Edward A. Brennan, alleging that United Way of America CEO William Aramony had affairs with two sisters (one of which was a teenager) and he was using the charity&#x27;s money to keep the women quiet. Aramony denied the allegations to Brennen. After UWA&#x27;s board reviewed and concluded that the letter&#x27;s allegations had no basis in March 1990, the matter was dropped.

It was later found that Aramony used the company&#x27;s dollars to fund luxurious expenses, including flights on a Concorde and $90,000 for his limousine service. Aramony had spun off two for-profit enterprises using United Way of America funds, the Partnership Umbrella and Sales Service/America. The suspicious set up raised questions if the companies, which were designed to offer bulk discounts and other cost-savings to local United Ways, were actually being used for Aramony&#x27;s personal enrichment. Partnership Umbrella had used United Way of America funds to purchase and decorate $1.2 million of real estate in Alexandria, Miami and New York, including a $459,000 condo in New York City for Aramony.

In December 1991, an outside firm was hired to conduct the investigation into the allegations. A lawyer concluded that there had been &quot;sloppy record-keeping&quot; and &quot;inattention to detail&quot; but avoided any specific admission of wrongdoing in the preliminary investigation.

Aramony, who was due to retire in July 1993, submitted his resignation on February 27, 1992, during a teleconference with local United Ways. Aramony said he was retiring &quot;to put things back in proper focus ... because media attention is overshadowing the importance of the work of United Way and the countless accomplishments we have made together.&quot; In April 1995, Aramony was convicted on 23 counts of felony charges, including conspiracy, fraud and filing false tax returns. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and served six years. Two associates, Thomas J. Merlo and Stephen J. Paulachak, were also convicted and sentenced to prison.

In the aftermath of the William Aramony scandal, local United Ways boycotted United Way of America by refusing to make their dues payments to the umbrella organization. Representatives from 13 of the US&#x27;s largest local United Ways told the interim President Kenneth Dam that they would like to see United Way of America half its current size. Of the 1,400 local United Ways, only 532 were paying some or all of their dues in 1992. To account for the lost revenue at United Way of America, employees were offered two months of added severance pay (in addition to the standard severance pay based on years of service) if they chose to resign, employees who stayed were offered up to four weeks off of furlough time, and all salary increases were halted.

IBM vice president Kenneth W. Dam was named interim CEO after Aramony&#x27;s departure in 1992. Elaine Chao was selected as president after Dam and stayed on until 1996.

=== Beene&#x27;s centralization efforts ===
Betty Stanley Beene took over in 1997. Beene advocated for a more-centralized system where United Way of America would take the lead on issues that affect all local United Ways and attempted to set national standards for all United Ways. This proposal would require that each local United Way undergo a thorough public self-examination of their effectiveness every few years.

United Way of America, under Beene leadership, paid Cap Gemini America $12 million to build charitable-pledge software for the &quot;United Way Information Network&quot;, a centralized national pledge processing center. The national center aimed to make donations more efficient and attractive to companies with national footprints. However, these plans competed with the regional pledge processing centers operated by four large regional United Ways. The software was riddled with issues and was unable to process gifts in its first test run. A review of the software by Deloitte &amp; Touche found 400 serious problems. United Way abandoned the project in 1999 and came to settlement with Cap Gemini in 2000.

Some local United Ways intensely rejected these plans, and withheld their dues to United Way of America as an act of protest. The United Way in Rochester went so far as to obtain the legal right to alternative names in the event the United Way broke up. These issues would, in part, lead to Beene&#x27;s departure in 2001.

Brian Gallagher, former head of United Way in Columbus, Ohio, took over as president and CEO in 2002.

=== Allowing donor-choice ===
United Way officially embraced a policy of donor designation in 1982, allowing donors to select which nonprofit organizations would receive their gift. Aramony first introduced the donor choice concept to prevent large employers from allowing alternative funds to solicit alongside United Way. However, United Ways resisted donation designations and the roll out of the new policy was described as a &quot;glacial pace&quot; in a 2000 piece in Fortune. Despite the slow rollout of donor-choice policies, dollars going to designations continued to grow over time. In 1990, only 14% of gifts went to outside charities. In 1999, United Way of America estimated that nearly 20% went to outside charities.

Allowing donor-choice caused donations to United Ways&#x27; general funds to decline. &quot;Sometimes I think we kid ourselves into thinking that by creating more choice we raise more money. That&#x27;s just not proven out,&quot; Gallagher said of donor-choice, &quot;I think we somewhat dilute our giving if we&#x27;re dividing our giving among thousands of agencies.&quot; In one case, the growth of amount of donor-choice contributed to the near-bankruptcy of United Way of Santa Clara County as the organization continued allocated the same amount year after year as their general fund pool shunk.

Kevin Ronnie of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy said of United Way&#x27;s predicament to allow designations, &quot;If they want to be the workplace campaign ... they have to offer choice because that&#x27;s what people want. But, gosh darn it, if you offer choice, people will do it, and that comes at the expense of what the United Way also wants to be – the community caretaker.&quot; Some United Way has focused efforts on marketing the benefits of their undesignated funds in to attempt to persuade donors away from donor designations.

To combat the image of the declining funds in United Ways&#x27; control, United Way counted designated funds as dollars raised by United Way, even though the money could not be allocated by United Way. The practice written about in Eleanor Brilliant 1990 book on United Way: &quot;...whether or not the money passed through the United Way allocations process seemed to be less important than making the largest nationwide counting of monies raised in the campaign. Undoubtedly, initially corporations were not concerned about this reporting system (and) had been making every effort to keep up both the reality and the façade of increased philanthropic dollars.&quot; These accounting practices would gain attention in 2002.

===Creation of 2-1-1===
The United Way of Atlanta created the first 2-1-1 service in 1997. The Atlanta information and referral service was conceived to help navigate people to find the best programs for their need (e.g. homeless shelters, tax preparation, after-school programs, rent assistance, etc.). In 1998, United Way of America and the Alliance of Information and Referral Services petitioned the FCC to reserve the 211 three-digit dialing code for community information and referral services. In 2000, the FCC granted the petition and left it to the states to designate who should operate 211 services in their regions.

The program spread and in 2005 all or part of 32 states and Washington, D.C., had access to 211, reaching almost half the nation&#x27;s population.

=== New community Impact model ===

In the year 2000, United Way of America announced a strategic shift in its focus away from simply being a fundraiser. United Way of America began promoting the &quot;Agenda for Community Impact&quot; model for local affiliates to adopt. Under the new model, United Ways would select local issues, focus fundraising efforts on those issues, and then make grants to nonprofits to carry out work addresses those issues. Instead of funding United Way&#x27;s traditional base of nonprofit agencies, the focus shifted to funding high priority causes. For example: a United Way might focus on reducing infant mortality in the community and provide funds to the local branch of the YWCA to provide education to parents about Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID).

As a nonprofit leader described it, &quot;In the past if you got money [from United Way], unless you screwed up, you were pretty much assured that you were going to get that money.&quot; The Community Impact suggested that funds were no longer a guarantee and that grants were competitive and performance-based driven by a nonprofit&#x27;s ability to achieve outcomes related to United Way goals.

Research by United Way of America showed that the approach was helping raise more funds. As a 2008 article in &quot;the Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; stated, In the five years since the organization announced it would focus on solving specific problems, the sums donated to 172 United Ways that adopted the so-called community-impact approach were 20 percent higher on average than giving to other United Ways. And among those using the community-impact approach, unrestricted donations are 26 percent higher than at other United Ways.

=== New reporting standards ===
In the wake of the Enron scandal, United Ways in 2002 faced questions on their accounting practices and discrepancies between different United Ways. In some cases, United Ways were double counting donations made across United Way territories which inflated their impact. These practices made their expense ratio seem lower by artificially inflating reported contributions.

After accounting issues came to light in the United Way in Washington, D.C. (and consequently exposed other problematic accounting practices within the United Way network), United Way of America adopted new accounting standards for its affiliates in 2003. United Way of America imposed new rules requiring all affiliates to adhere to a shared standard of reporting revenue and overhead costs, with the 150 largest affiliates required for the first time to submit financial information to outside accountants. Some United Ways were not able to meet the new standards and the board disaffiliated these 61 United Ways.

Some experts believed that the subsequent decline in United Way&#x27;s 2002–03 campaign were the results of these accounting changes. In one case, the new reporting standards, which ended the practice of counting the value of in-kind donations in campaign totals, caused the United Way of Volusia-Flagler Counties in Daytona Beach to eliminate around $400,000 from its campaign results.

=== Competing with online giving platforms ===
By the 2000s, United Way has faced competition for control of the workplace campaign from technology companies offering customized platforms for employee giving and volunteering. One of the most promising competitors, Charitableway, raised $43 million in 2000 and secured agreements with Hewlett-Packard and Morgan Stanley to run their campaigns.

After the failure of the &quot;United Way Information Network&quot; and out of fear that the new for-profit companies would court their corporate supporters, a group of United Ways developed the online United eWay system to bring the traditional pen-and-paper pledge cards online. The software prototype was developed by a consortium of 50 United Ways with technical assistance from Microsoft. The product was run as a United Way of America subsidiary until it was purchased by CreateHope Inc. in 2008 and spun off as a separate for-profit company TRUiST, Inc.

Charitableway folded with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, other competitors like Benevity would fare better. Benevity was founded in 2008 and has become the workplace campaign provider of Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, T-Mobile, TripAdvisor, Charles Schwab, and Nike. Benevity processed $649 million in donations in the 2018 fiscal year. A 2020 report from Realized Worth&#x27;s RW Institute found that there were 51 employee-giving technology platforms.

To better compete with technology companies, Salesforce.org (the philanthropic arm of Salesforce) and United Way Worldwide launched &quot;Philanthropy Cloud,&quot; a workplace donation platform, in 2018.

=== Gallagher&#x27;s resignation ===
Gallagher resigned from United Way Worldwide in March 2021 following an investigation into the termination of three female employees at United Way Worldwide who had filed workplace sexual harassment complaints.

In November 2020, the HuffPost reported that three female employees at United Way Worldwide filed complaints between 2019 and 2020 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These complaints alleged sexual harassment and retaliation by UWW after they spoke up about the behavior.

In response to the allegations, United Way Worldwide commissioned Proskauer Rose to investigate the claims. The investigation found no &quot;actionable harassment, discrimination, or retaliation&quot; at the organization but the report also noted &quot;the need to address the broader organizational and reputation issues.&quot; Lisa Bowman, who alleged then-CEO Brian Gallagher fired her as retaliation for reporting sexual harassment by another executive, called the inquiry &quot;not a thorough, fair, or reliable investigation.&quot; United Way Worldwide&#x27;s former vice president for labor engagement, Ana Avendaño, also filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging that United Way Worldwide retaliated by firing her after she uncovered sexual harassment of female United Way employees by AFL–CIO leaders. Avendaño said that while she was not contacted during the investigation she has &quot;information that would&#x27;ve helped in the investigation.&quot; The third woman who filed an EEOC complaint (who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation) said that she was not contacted either by the investigators and that she was &quot;not at all surprised&quot; about the report findings, &quot;It&#x27;s what I expected.&quot;

Gallagher said when announcing his retirement, &quot;There is no evidence of a toxic or hostile culture. Is there room for improvement? Absolutely, just like almost any other workplace.&quot;

On October 15, 2021, Angela F. Williams replaced Gallagher as United Way Worldwide CEO. She is the first female and African-American to hold the position in United Way Worldwide&#x27;s history. Previous to this position, Williams was the CEO at Easter Seals. She also worked as executive vice president, general counsel, and chief administration officer at YMCA of the USA.

== Cross–United Way partnerships and common initiatives ==
While each local United Way has its own programs and initiatives, there are some national and international initiatives that are formed between United Ways or by the United Way Worldwide body.

* NFL partnership: The ongoing partnership with the National Football League began in 1973 when the NFL and United Way of America came together to discuss the possibility of using the NFL&#x27;s network contract airtime to promote United Way during game telecasts. NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle recognized the partnership as a viable means of communicating the good works of United Way while putting faces on a league of players hidden by helmets.
* Philanthropy Cloud: a workplace donation platform created in partnership with Salesforce. As of January 2020, over 200 companies, including 25 local United Ways, were using the service.
*Since 1946, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO) and United Way have enjoyed a cooperative relationship.
* Loaned Executive Program: In this program, participating companies &quot;loan&quot; skilled professionals on their payroll to volunteer for temporary fundraising assignments at local United Ways, while the employee&#x27;s salary is paid by their employer. IBM, Texaco, Nestle, Honeywell, UPS, and NYNEX have participated in the program by volunteering their employees&#x27; time to United Way.
* Tocqueville Society: many United Ways have Tocqueville Societies (named after Alexis De Tocqueville) for donors giving more than $10,000 each year. Some local United Way organizations also offer a Tocqueville award to recognize philanthropy or community activism in their communities.

== Controversies ==
In United Way&#x27;s history, it has been the subject of several local and national controversies.

* In 1986, The United Way of Cleveland, Ohio, held an event called Balloonfest &#x27;86, setting a world record by releasing 1.5 million balloons. The event had disastrous consequences, wreaking havoc at Burke Lakefront Airport and Lake Erie, causing injury to animals and contributing to two fishermen&#x27;s deaths.
* In 1992, William Aramony, CEO of the national organization for over 20 years, retired amid allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement, of which he was subsequently convicted. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined $300,000.
* In 2004, Oral Suer, the CEO of United Way of the National Capital Area in Washington, D.C., was convicted of misuse of donations. He pleaded guilty to theft of almost $500,000 and was sentenced to 27 months in prison. Norman O. Taylor, Suer&#x27;s replacement, was never charged with misconduct but was forced to resign.
* In 2006, Ralph Dickerson Jr., the former CEO of United Way of New York City, was found to have used $227,000 in United Way funds for personal expenses during 2002 and 2003. He later agreed to reimburse the organization.
*After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the United Way of Western Connecticut was criticized by some victims&#x27; family members for a lack of transparency in fundraising. According to those critical of the agency, the money was raised in a way that implied it would be used for the families, but then much of it re-purposed for broader community needs. As the organization focuses on community long term work, the United Way stated that majority was intended to go to non-exclusive, community support programs like counseling, after school or job-support programs; however, this angered those who felt the money should go directly to the families of those affected.
* In 2021, United Way Worldwide CEO Brian Gallagher resigned over claims of mishandled complaints of sexual harassment and discrimination at the United Way Worldwide office. Three female employees had filed complaints with the EEOC alleging they experienced sexual harassment and that they were retaliated against by United Way Worldwide after speaking out about the harassment.

== Criticisms ==
=== Donation coercion in the workplace ===
While United Way&#x27;s workplace fundraising campaigns may help encourage higher donation levels among co-workers, it may also lead to employees feeling pressure to take part. Some employees may feel coerced to donate to United Way by their co-workers or management soliciting contributions in their workplace.

A reporter with the Atlanta Business Chronicle described it as this: &quot;The problem with the United Way&#x27;s methods is simple: When the CEO of a company gathers employees in a room and strongly encourages them to donate to the United Way, most of them are going to donate. And many will be doing so out of fear that there could be consequences if they don&#x27;t.&quot;

United Way lists guidelines on its national website to prevent coercion, including having non-managers lead the solicitation and discouraging setting campaigns with 100 percent participation goals.

=== Role as an intermediary in the donation process ===
Some have labeled United Way a &quot;middleman&quot; since it raises funds and then passes them on to nonprofit agencies. In 2007, Brian Gallagher said that critics who still see United Way that way have not followed more recent developments of the organization: &quot;Six years ago we were much more focused – or split – on fund-raising. ... Instead of the model being &#x27;one campaign for all; give us the money and we&#x27;ll decide where it goes&#x27;, we moved to a model where we identified issues, strategies and products, and segmented our markets so we knew what women and young people, and corporations and foundations, cared about.&quot; Addressing the middle man label directly he said that &quot;nobody wants anything or one in the middle of a transaction that doesn&#x27;t add value. ... Folks use the term middle man as a negative. It is not a negative if it adds value.&quot;

=== Monopolistic practices ===
United Way has been criticized for its dominance over workplace giving and for making exclusionary funding decisions. In 1978, the National Commission on Neighborhoods released a report prepared by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy which found that United Way used &quot;both fair and foul&quot; practices to &quot;monopolize solicitation of employees at the workplace.&quot; The report claimed that United Way is &quot;an exclusionary group, designed to keep out most neighborhood groups and smaller charities.&quot; The report called for a repeal of the organization&#x27;s policies &quot;which insist on a monopoly of workplace solicitation.&quot;

United Way of America senior vice president Robert Beggan responded to the allegations saying, &quot;We neither control payroll deductions, nor do we exclude other organizations from seeking payroll deductions.&quot; Addressing the exclusionary allocations claim he said, &quot;we allocate money [to member charities] on need not on emotion. ... There&#x27;s a finite amount of money available and an infinite amount of need, and we have to be careful.&quot; By the mid-1970s, just 13 nonprofits (including the YMCA, the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts, and the Salvation Army) accounted for more than 57% of all United Way allocations.

To limit competing with fundraisers from disease-related nonprofit organizations, some United Ways have signed contractual agreements with nonprofits guaranteeing them with a level of funding if they incorporate their fundraising efforts under United Way&#x27;s campaign.

By design, United Way aims to provide support for large, local human service organizations through a process of consensus decision making. The result inevitably favors funding of moderate and traditional agencies over civil rights and controversial causes. Planned Parenthood, The Boy Scouts of America, counseling services for gay youth, and, initially, programs for people with HIV/AIDS have been excluded to avoid turning off potential donors.

<doc id="212207" wikidata="Q1405064" url="?curid=212207" title="Ship money">
<text>Ship money was a tax of medieval origin levied intermittently in the Kingdom of England until the middle of the 17th century. Assessed typically on the inhabitants of coastal areas of England, it was one of several taxes that English monarchs could levy by prerogative without the approval of Parliament. The attempt of King Charles I from 1634 onwards to levy ship money during peacetime and extend it to the inland counties of England without parliamentary approval provoked fierce resistance, and was one of the grievances of the English propertied class in the lead-up to the English Civil War.

==Traditional practice==

The Plantagenet kings of England had exercised the right of requiring the maritime towns and counties to furnish ships in time of war, and this duty was sometimes commuted for a money payment.

Although several statutes of Edward I and Edward III, notably their confirmations of Magna Carta, had made it illegal for the Crown to exact any taxes without the consent of Parliament, the prerogative of levying ship money in time of war had never fallen wholly into abeyance. In 1619, James I aroused no popular opposition by levying £40,000 () of ship money on London and £8,550 on other seaport towns.

==Opposition==

In 1628, Charles I, having prorogued Parliament in early summer and after his assent to the Petition of Right, proceeded to levy ship money on every county in England without Parliament, issuing writs requiring £173,000 to be returned to the exchequer. This was the first occasion when the demand for ship-money aroused serious opposition, in view of the declaration in the petition that

[Y]our subjects have inherited this freedom, that they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax, tallage, aid, or other like charge not set by common consent, in parliament.

Charles&#x27; requests to sheriffs were rejected by the overburdened inland populations; Lord Northampton, Lord-Lieutenant of Warwickshire, and the Earl of Banbury in Berkshire, refused to assist in collecting the money; and Charles withdrew the writs.

In 1634, Charles made a secret treaty with Philip IV of Spain to assist him against the Dutch. To raise funds for this, William Noy, the Attorney-General, suggested that further resort should be had to ship money. Noy investigated such legal learning as there was in support of the demand, and unearthed old records of ship money in the Tower of London; some historians, such as Hallam, have seen Noy&#x27;s findings as evidence that, before Charles&#x27; use of it, the tax had been disused for centuries.

The King obtained an opinion affirming the legality of the writ from Lord Keeper Coventry and the Earl of Manchester, whereupon the writ was issued in October 1634 and directed to the justices of London and other seaports, requiring them to provide a certain number of ships of war of a prescribed tonnage and equipment, or their equivalent in money, and empowering them to assess the inhabitants for payment of the tax, according to their substance.

===Three writs ===
The distinctive feature of the writ of 1634 was that it was issued, contrary to all precedent, in time of peace. Charles desired to conceal the true aim of his policy, which he knew would be detested by the country, and he accordingly gave as a pretext for the impost the danger to commerce from pirates, and the general condition of unrest in Europe.

The citizens of London immediately claimed exemption under their charter, while other towns argued as to the amount of their assessment; but no resistance on constitutional grounds appears to have been offered, and £104,000 was collected.

On 9 October 1635, a second writ of ship money was issued, directed to the sheriffs and justices of inland as well as of maritime counties and towns, as in the revoked writ of 1628. £208,000 was demanded, to be obtained by assessment on personal as well as real property, payment to be enforced by distraint.

This demand gave rise to popular discontent, which now began to see a determination on the part of the king to dispense altogether with parliamentary government. Charles responded with a written opinion, signed by ten out of twelve judges consulted, to the effect that in time of national danger, of which the Crown was the sole judge, ship money might legally be levied on all parts of the country by writ under the Great Seal.

The issue of a third writ of ship money on 9 October 1636 made it evident that the ancient restrictions that limited the levying of the tax to the maritime parts of the kingdom and to times of war (or imminent national danger) had been finally swept away, and the king intended to convert it into a permanent and general form of taxation without parliamentary sanction. The judges again, at Charles&#x27;s request, gave an opinion favourable to the prerogative, which was read by Lord Coventry in the Star Chamber and by the judges on assize.

===Refusal, then repeal===

Ship money enabled Charles to meet peacetime government expenditures in the 1630s. Payment was, however, refused by John Hampden, a wealthy Buckinghamshire gentleman landowner. The case against the latter (&quot;R v Hampden&quot;) was finally heard before all 12 judges in the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1637, after Denham had expressed his doubts to Davenport, who was wary of the four-judge panel which would have sat in a less unusual case. Hampden was defended by Oliver St John and Robert Holborne. The Solicitor-General, Sir Edward Littleton, and the Attorney-General, Sir John Banks, prosecuted. Hampden&#x27;s lawyers argued that the taxation was the king going around Parliament and attempting to squeeze money out from the people of England, while defenders of the king suggested that these taxes were necessary for the defense and safety of England. Hampden lost the case, seven judges to five:

* For the King:
** Sir Richard Weston
** Sir Francis Crawley
** Sir Robert Berkley
** Sir George Vernon
** Sir Thomas Trevor
** Sir William Jones
** Sir John Finch
* For Hampden:
** Sir George Crooke
** Sir Richard Hutton
** Sir John Denham
** Sir John Brampston
** Sir Humphrey Davenport

== Aftermath ==
Despite the trial case being won by Charles the opposition to ship money continued. In 1640, a group of citizens of London petitioned Charles directly and at the top of their grievances was against the tax:The petition starts off by attacking the tax: The pressing and unusual Impositions upon Merchandize, Importing and Exporting, and the urging and Levying of Ship-money, notwithstanding both which, Merchants Ships and Goods have been taken and destroyed both by Turkish and other Pirates.The narrowness of the case encouraged others to refuse the tax. By 1639, less than 20% of the money demanded was raised. As matters deteriorated in England and Scotland starting with the Bishops&#x27; War, ship money proved to be insufficient to finance the king&#x27;s military needs. It was later stopped by the Long Parliament when they voted the Ship Money Act 1640 (16 Cha. 1. c. 14). Hampden went on to Parliamentary and Civil War leadership, only to die early on at the Battle of Chalgrove Field. Finally, half a century later, in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights 1689 prohibited all forms of extra-parliamentary taxation.

<text>Antony Price is an English fashion designer best known for evening wear and suits, and for being as much an &quot;image-maker&quot; as a designer. He has collaborated with a number of high-profile musicians, including David Bowie, Robert Palmer, Iva Davies, Steve Strange, and Duran Duran, but especially Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music, whose look was defined by Price&#x27;s designs. The manner in which Price dressed – or in many cases, undressed – the &quot;Roxy girls&quot; on the covers of their albums helped to define the band&#x27;s pop retro-futurism.

More recently, Price has been noted for dressing celebrities such as Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Patsy Kensit, Anjelica Huston, Jerry Hall, Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana Ross, Melanie Griffith, Yasmin Le Bon and burlesque performer Dita Von Teese.

==Early life and education==
Price was born in Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1945, and grew up Selside in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, later moving to Oxenhope. He was educated at Eshton Hall School for Boys in Gargrave, Yorkshire. In 1961, At the age of 16, he gained entrance to the Bradford School of Art – now the Bradford School of Arts and Media Studies – completing a one-year General Art and Design course, followed by specialising for three years in Womenswear Fashion. In 1965 he entered the Royal College of Art&#x27;s Fashion School in London where he completed a three-year course – two years in Womenswear Fashion, and the final year and degree show in Menswear Fashion. Price credits his time at the Bradford School as invaluable in preparing him for the Royal College, saying: &quot;I arrived at the Royal College of Art with a total headstart and was able to whip my own show together.&quot;

==Early career==
Directly out of college, in 1968, Price began working for the new Stirling Cooper shop, designing men&#x27;s trousers, coats and waistcoats which drew on sexual fetishism for their impact. Stirling Cooper was situated in London&#x27;s Wigmore Street, and had a noted oriental interior designed by Price and Jane Whiteside. With Juliet Mann, Price also designed the next shop he designed for, from 1969–1974, Che Guevara on Kensington High Street. Prudence Glynn, fashion editor for &quot;The Times&quot; tipped him as a major new fashion talent in &#x27;Trendsetters&#x27;, giving him the main picture and writing that &#x27;Anthony Price is a sensational cutter and he puts a lot of work and thought into the shaping of even the most casual clothes. His range of little bare tops in crepe and cotton, for example, are technical feats, for they all have bra sections cut into the pattern ... he is undoubtedly a trendsetter and in advance of his time ... his clothes have great wit and gaiety and he is certainly a name to be watched in the future&#x27;. He next designed for Plaza, and then, in 1979, started his own label, with shops in South Molton Street and on the King&#x27;s Road. He also operated a shop called &#x27;Ebony&#x27; in the 1980s.

Price&#x27;s button trousers for Stirling Cooper were worn by Mick Jagger for The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 American &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; Tour. In addition, his bridge-crutch trousers were feat of technical skill, inventing a new construction that highlighted the male crotch and buttocks. He was the stylist for Roxy Music&#x27;s first eight albums, as well as for the back cover for Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot; 1972 Transformer&quot; album. His self-declared trademark design is a spiral-zipped dress in ciré satin, first seen worn by Amanda Lear in Nova&#x27;s cover story for its May 1970 issue, &#x27;How To Undress for Your Husband&#x27; and later featured as one of &#x27;Princess Zonda&#x27;s archetypal outfits in the advertisements Price drew himself for Plaza in the late seventies. The Lear pictures appeared in Peter York&#x27;s feature on Price in Harper&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s April 1979 issue. Lear was also the Price-dressed covergirl for Roxy Music&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;.

In 1982, Price collaborated with the British band Duran Duran, designing electric silk tonic suits for the &quot;Rio&quot; video.

In 1983, Price staged a &#x27;Fashion Extravaganza&#x27; at the London&#x27;s Camden Palace.

A year later, in 1984, Price staged another &#x27;Fashion Extravaganza&#x27; at the London&#x27;s Hippodrome, combining fashion and rock music. &quot;I&#x27;m partly responsible for the marriage of rock and fashion,&quot; Price said in 1998, &quot;When I started out, rock people thought fashion people were snobby and fashion people though the music industry grubby and dirty.&quot; Stylist David Thomas says about Price&#x27;s influence:

He reinvented the suit so that it was no longer about going to the office. He made it rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. He started at a time when British fashion didn&#x27;t have sponsors. It was the era before the superstar designer. They all came after him. Yet he was a visionary. He created that military, dandy, sexy, eclectic men&#x27;s look. He created rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll fashion.

Price has declared that &#x27;I&#x27;m not a fashion designer ... I&#x27;m in the theatrical business,&#x27; and for Fashion Aid at Albert Hall in 1985 he conceived of a presentation of model, client and long-standing friend Jerry Hall emerging from a black velvet box. The outfit consisted of a bolero and dress with lampshade peplum in metallic and red French silk lace over lamé. Price has said of this outfit &#x27;It wasn&#x27;t the chicest or most subtle garment, but when Jerry moved under the lights she looked like a Siamese fighting fish in a vast blue tank.&#x27;

Price received the &#x27;Evening Glamour Award&#x27; from the British Fashion Council in 1989, and the following year British &quot;Vogue&quot; published a profile on Price written by Sarah Mower. He described his approach to designing women&#x27;s clothing in an interview in 1994:

My clothes are men&#x27;s idea of what women should wear, and for that they&#x27;ll pay good money. ... Men are looking for the sex robot from Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; with the perfect body offering endless fantasy sex. They&#x27;re obsessed by the size of sexual protuberances – their own as well as women&#x27;s – and I&#x27;m an illusionist. My job is to give them what they want.

==Recent career==
Price was widely considered to be a frontrunner in the search to replace Gianni Versace in 1998, after that designer&#x27;s untimely death.

In 2000, Price opened his own showroom again in Chelsea, London under the financial backing and Directorship of Dean Aslett, who had previously worked with Price in the late 1980s at the Nick Rhodes-backed Antony Price Boutique in Brook Street, Mayfair. Price also created evening gowns constructed of carpet to feature in the advertising campaigns of British carpet manufacturer Brintons, a commission previously undertaken by Vivienne Westwood. In 2000 he created clothing for Glenalmond Tweed, along with 25 other British designers including Westwood, Alexander McQueen and Margaret Howell, and in 2003 he was among a number of British designers who created gowns for Pamela Anderson when she hosted the British Fashion Awards that year.

Price was nominated for the British Fashion Council&#x27;s &#x27;Red Carpet Designer Award&#x27; at the 2006 British Fashion Awards, and a small range of his clothes sell in London boutique &#x27;A La Mode&#x27;. He was featured in the fashion magazines Pop and Butt in spring 2005. In December 2006, Price was photographed by David Bailey for British &quot;Vogue&quot; alongside Christopher Kane. Price has worked with Daphne Guinness in developing a range of key shirt and tailoring designs for her eponymous clothing line, which is currently sold in London&#x27;s Dover Street Market. He also launched a line of menswear for Topman in November 2008.

Price continues to design clothing, including the Duchess of Cornwall. In May 2012, he dressed actress Tilda Swinton for his appearance in drag for the cover of &quot;Candy&quot; magazine, described as &quot;the first fashion magazine completely dedicated to celebrating transvestism, transsexuality, crossdressing and androgyny in all their glory.&quot; In 2013, Price resumed his association with Steve Strange (whom previously he had designed outfits for during the Visage – The Anvil period in 1982) and designed an outfit for the relaunch of Steve Strange&#x27;s Visage project, which he wore for the David Bowie V&amp;A Exhibition Private View Gala Night.

<doc id="212210" wikidata="Q7997549" url="?curid=212210" title="Whole blood">
<text>Whole blood (WB) is human blood from a standard blood donation. It is used in the treatment of massive bleeding, in exchange transfusion, and when people donate blood to themselves (autologous transfusion). One unit of whole blood (approximately 450 mL) increases hemoglobin levels by about 10 g/L. Cross matching is typically done before the blood is given. It is given by injection into a vein.
Side effects include red blood cell breakdown, high blood potassium, infection, volume overload, lung injury, and allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Whole blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma. It is best within a day of collection; however, it can be stored for up to three weeks if refrigerated (1-6 °C). The blood is typically combined with an anticoagulant and preservative during the collection process.
The first transfusion of whole blood was in 1818; however, common use did not begin until the First and Second World Wars. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Whole blood is also used to make a number of blood products including red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma.

==Medical use==
Whole blood has similar risks to a transfusion of red blood cells and is typically cross-matched to avoid hemolytic transfusion reactions. The use of whole blood is common in low- and middle-income countries. Over 40% of blood collected in low-income countries is administered as whole blood, and approximately a third of all blood collected in middle-income countries is administered as whole blood.

Whole blood is sometimes &quot;recreated&quot; from stored red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for neonatal transfusions. This is done to provide a final product with a very specific hematocrit (percentage of red cells) with type O red cells and type AB plasma to minimize the chance of complications.

Transfusion of whole blood is being used in the military setting and in the civilian setting, where it is being used in pre-hospital trauma care and in the setting of massive transfusion in the civilian setting. Whole blood can be ABO-type specific when the recipient blood type is known. When the recipient’s blood group is not known, particularly in pre-hospital transfusion, low-titer O universal donor whole blood (LTOWB) can be used; this requires that the donor plasma contains only low titers of anti-A and anti-B.

==Processing==
Historically, blood was transfused as whole blood without further processing. Most blood banks now split the whole blood into two or more components, typically red blood cells and a plasma component such as fresh frozen plasma. Platelets for transfusion can also be prepared from a unit of whole blood, whereby 4 or 5 buffy coats are pooled to produce a platelet component. Some blood banks have replaced this with platelets collected by plateletpheresis because whole blood platelets, sometimes called &quot;random donor&quot; platelets, must be pooled from multiple donors to get enough for an adult therapeutic dose.

The collected blood is generally separated into components by one of three methods. A centrifuge can be used in a &quot;hard spin&quot; which separates whole blood into plasma and red cells or a &quot;soft spin&quot; which separates it into plasma, buffy coat (used to make platelets), and red blood cells. The third method is sedimentation: the blood simply sits overnight, and the red cells and plasma are separated by gravitational interactions, which is used predominantly in low-income countries.

==Storage==
Whole blood is typically stored under the same conditions as red blood cells and can be kept up to 35 days if collected with citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine-1 (CPDA-1) anticoagulant solution, or 21 days with other common anticoagulants such as citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD).

If the whole blood is used to make platelets, it is kept at room temperature until the process is complete. Whole blood processing must be completed within 24 hours to minimize the warm storage of red cells in the unit.

<text>Alan Currall (born 1964) is an English artist based in Scotland.

Currall was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, and grew up in Staffordshire and Ayrshire, Scotland. Currall studied at the Glasgow School of Art and since 1993 has been based in Glasgow and rural Dumfries &amp; Galloway.

Much of Currall&#x27;s work is video-based, shot cheaply with a tripod-mounted camera, and features Currall himself. &quot;Message to My Best Friend&quot; is Currall apparently praising his best friend to the skies (&quot;You&#x27;ve got a great record collection. The way you dress is cool but funky.&quot;). Other video works have seen him asking his parents for their advice on how best to survive such disasters as a shipwreck, a plane crash and nuclear war, and reading his own will out loud.

In 2000, Currall produced &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; with the support of the film and video umbrella. &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; is a CD-ROM encyclopaedia with video clips by &#x27;non-experts&#x27; who have influenced the artist in some way, such as his friends and family.

In 1998, Currall won the Richard Hough Bursary.
In 2003, Currall was shortlisted for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize.
In 2004, Currall was one of five selected artists for the Jerwood Artists Platform.

<text>David Sherry (born 1974) is a Northern Irish artist.

Born in 1974, in Northern Ireland, Sherry studied at the Glasgow School of Art. He is best known for his performance art. &quot;Stitching&quot; is a video of him stitching pieces of wood to his feet while he offers verbal instructions on how to do this. Other works include &quot;Carrying a bucket of water about for a week&quot; and &quot;Avoiding eye contact for one seven-day period&quot;, both of which consist of the activities in their titles. Sherry has said he is trying to &quot;expose the systematic processes of day to day life&quot;.

In 2003, Sherry was shortlisted for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize.

In 2006, Sherry exhibited at WestGermany Gallery, Berlin. The exhibition was entitled &#x27;Solid&#x27;.

In 2012, Flawedcore Records released Sherry&#x27;s album of spoken word and music &quot;I Love Those Paintings&quot;. This release triggered a curated group exhibition by Mother&#x27;s Tankstation, an art gallery in Dublin.

He lives and works in Glasgow.

<text>Inventory are a collective of British artists, writers and art theorists, founded in 1996.

Some of their pieces see them engage in performance art in public spaces. 

&quot;Coagulum (Oxford Street)&quot; in 2000, saw them form into a close group on London&#x27;s Oxford Street, thus disrupting the flow of pedestrians, before entering a shopping centre and dancing to the piped music. For another piece, they played football on The Mall with a rubber skull, using Buckingham Palace and Admiralty Arch as goals.

Other pieces, such as the installation &quot;Requiem for the Empty Quarter&quot; at The Approach Gallery in Bethnal Green during 2002, used modified and written-upon objects found on the street.

In 2003, Inventory were nominated for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize.

<doc id="212219" wikidata="Q7367240" url="?curid=212219" title="Rosalind Nashashibi">
<text>Layla Rosalind Nashashibi (born 1973) is a Palestinian-English artist based in London. Nashashibi works mainly with 16 mm film but also makes paintings and prints. Her work often deals with everyday observations merged with mythological elements, considering the relationships and moments between community and extended family.

==Early life and education==
Nashashibi was born in 1973 to a Palestinian father and Irish mother, in Croydon, a large town in South London. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Fine Art from Sheffield Hallam University, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom in 1995. She completed a Master of Fine Arts degree at The Glasgow School of Art in 2000. During this time she spent three months in CalArts, California, as part of a masters exchange program.

== Work ==
Much of Nashashibi&#x27;s work consists of films of everyday life in urban environments. She works mainly with 16 mm film as well as photography, print and painting. Her films often use various narrative techniques in order to link staged scenes with imagery of real life.

&quot;Abbeys&quot; (2006) comprises a series of four black and white photographs that each depicts an upside-down view of an abbey&#x27;s archway that when flipped as such reveals an anthropomorphic face. The uncanny images are based on photos Nashashibi found in an old photograph album.

&quot;The State of Things&quot; is a black-and-white film of old ladies at a Salvation Army jumble sale in Glasgow with a love song by the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum on the soundtrack. The exact location of the film is unclear, and Nashashibi has said that many people, when first seeing the grainy footage, assume the women to be from some non-British culture or from an earlier time.

&quot;Dahiet a Bareed, District of the Post Office&quot; was filmed in the West Bank in an area designed by the artist&#x27;s grandfather. The film is about people playing football, having their hair cut and so on. &quot;Midwest&quot; and &quot;Midwest Field&quot; depict life in Omaha, Nebraska.

She works collaboratively with artist Lucy Skaer under the name Nashashibi/Skaer. Meeting in Glasgow, they began working together in 2005 when they made their first joint work called &quot;The Ambassador,&quot; a two-screen video about the British Consul General in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nashashibi/Skaer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have continued to collaborate alongside their individual practices, most often making 16mm films together, to explore shared interests through film and exhibition making including female representation and global cultures. Their joint work has been exhibited widely internationally.

In 2019 Nashashibi became the first artist in residence at the National Gallery, London, in a new residency scheme linked to its Modern and contemporary art programme. The year-long residency includes working in the gallery&#x27;s onsite studio, receipt of an award to fund her work for the year, access to the gallery&#x27;s collections and research, and culminates in an exhibition and publication of work.

In 2017 she was nominated for the Turner Prize, exhibiting work in the Turner prize exhibition in the Ferens Gallery in Hull alongside the three other nominees. She exhibited the two films she was nominated for; &quot;Vivian&#x27;s Garden&quot; (2017) and &quot;Electrical Gaza&quot; (2015). The work &quot;Vivian&#x27;s Garden&quot; was previously presented at &quot;Documenta 14,&quot; which focuses on the relationship between and daily life of mother and daughter artists Vivian Suter and Elisabeth Wild at their home in Guatemala. &quot;Electrical Gaza&quot; was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, and combines real film footage with animation to depict the mixing of daily life in Gaza and the complex charged atmosphere of the place.

In 2022 she was appointed as an artist trustee of Tate by the prime minister for a four-year term.

<doc id="212222" wikidata="Q5039223" url="?curid=212222" title="Carey Young">
<text>Carey Young (born 1970) is a visual artist whose work uses a variety of media including video, photography, text and installation. Her work often examines and questions the reach of the legal and commercial spheres and their ability to shape contemporary reality. Since 2017, she has created two films featuring female judges in order to examine the interrelationships of law, fiction and gender. Young teaches at the Slade School of Fine Art in London where she is a Professor in Fine Art.

==Early life and education==
Born in Lusaka in Zambia in 1970, Young grew up in Manchester, England and studied at Manchester Polytechnic, the University of Brighton and photography at the Royal College of Art in London. She has dual US/UK citizenship and lives and works in London, UK.

==Exhibitions and themes==
Exhibitions of Young&#x27;s work include solo exhibitions at Modern Art Oxford, Dallas Museum of Art, Migros Museum of Contemporary Art, The Power Plant, the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, and inclusion in group exhibitions at Centre Pompidou, Tate Britain, the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Hayward Gallery, Secession, Kunstverein München, Mass MOCA, MoMA PS1, Jeu de Paume and the Venice, Moscow, Taipei, Tirana and Busan

Young&#x27;s work is included in the public collections of the Centre Pompidou, Arts Council England, Dallas Museum of Art, and Tate.

Young&#x27;s projects often centre on ideas of the body, language, rhetoric, and systems of power. In her early video works, she wore attire appropriate to the business worlds, enacting often-ironic scenarios which examine and question its power to shape society and individual identity.

Since 2002, her work has shifted into an interest in law and the legal imagination, and was the first to develop the idea of using law as an artistic medium. &#x27;Disclaimer&#x27;, a 2003 exhibition at the Henry Moore Institute examined legal disclaimers as a form of negative space. In 2005, she showed &#x27;Consideration&#x27;, a series of works exploring the connections between contract law and performance art at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York as part of the PERFORMA05 Biennial. RoseLee Goldberg described the works in this show as &quot;dealing with the overwhelming power of the law.&quot; This is seen again in &quot;Declared Void&quot; (2005), which explores the relationship between the law and the constitutional rights of individuals.

Her 2013 exhibition &quot;Legal Fictions&quot; at Migros Museum in Zurich was described by Mousse Magazine as featuring:&quot;law-based works [that] address the monolithic power of the legal system. The artist examines law as a conceptual and abstract space in which power, rights, and authority are played out through varying forms of performance and language. With the drafting assistance of legal advisers, her works often take the form of experimental but functional legal instruments such as contracts, and also employ media such as video, installation, and text.&quot; 

Her 2017 video installation &quot;Palais de Justice&quot;, at Paula Cooper Gallery was described by critic Jeffrey Kastner as: “quietly stunning … vividly proposes a juridical world as it might otherwise be, a form of the Law that may someday be possible.” Johanna Fateman, Artforum, described the work as: &quot;a transfixing (...) speculative fiction&quot;, a &quot;tantalising (...) novel mockup of a post-patriarchal legal system.&quot; 

Laura Cumming, of &quot;The Observer&quot;, said &quot;Young’s profound and involving examination of the law has continued through film, photography and installation art for more than 20 years. (...) The laws that govern our rights, our agency and even our movements in this world are, for Young, &#x27;a form of choreography&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Francis Upritchard (born 1976) is a New Zealand contemporary artist based in London. In 2009, she represented New Zealand at the Venice Biennale.

==Education==

Upritchard graduated from the Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury, School of Fine Arts in 1997. She had initially thought to study painting, but became interested in sculpture during her first year.

Soon after graduating, Upritchard moved to London.

==Work==

Upritchard&#x27;s early work often referenced museum displays, collections of artefacts, and ancient cultures. She often combined found objects with her own hand-made additions, such as sculpted heads made from modelleing clay of dogs, monkeys and birds inserted into the necks of ceramic and glass vessels, or fastened onto pieces of sporting equipment like hockey sticks and cricket bats. Other works showed faux-antique delicate instruments in shabby velvet-lined boxes. She also became known for her sculptures that replicated shrunken heads, resting on display cabinets or mounted on small pedestals. Made of plaster and paper mache, the heads referenced mokomokai, tattooed shrunken heads made by New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous Māori, but the features were those of Pākeha peoples.

In 2006/2007, Upritchard decided to start exploring the human figure in her work. In a 2012 newspaper profile she said: &#x27;I didn&#x27;t think there was so much good figurative work in contemporary sculpture. [...] I went to Munich and saw [the 15th-century sculptor] Erasmus Grasser&#x27;s Morris Dancers.&#x27; Upritchard&#x27;s figures are made of polymer clay laid over wire armatures; their skin is painted in everything from neutral tones to brightly coloured grids, and they are variously naked and clothed in robes and gowns, also made by the artist. Curator Anne Ellegood writes:

Some hail from long-ago eras—protagonists of medieval mythology like the knight, the harlequin, the jester—while others are from the more recent past—beatniks, hippies, and other nonconformists. Various figures are identified by their vocation—music teacher, potato seller, psychic—or distilled to a primary, and often less than laudatory, characteristic, such as “liar,” “misanthrope,” “ninny,” or “nincompoop.”

The influences on Upritchard&#x27;s figurative sculptures are various: the figures in the Bayeux tapestry, Japanese Noh theatre, 1960s psychedelic portraiture, Grasser&#x27;s wooden figures, the bronze figures of the Chola dynasty, court jesters and medieval performers. Writers about these works often reference counter-cultural movements, hippies, shamans and marionettes when describing them. Comparisons have been made to the earlier work of Bruce Conner and Paul Thek and Upritchard&#x27;s closer contemporaries Ryan Trecartin, Lizzie Fitch and Saya Woolfalk.

Upritchard often collaborates with furniture designer Martino Gamper (also her husband) on the plinths her sculpted forms stand on, which sometimes take the forms of tables and bureaus, and more recently of steel pedestals. Natalie Hegert writes:

The care taken in the aesthetic choices of furniture reveals Upritchard’s interest in craft, further evidenced by her attention to textiles, lamps, jewelry, urns, and other accoutrements. In Upritchard’s sculpture, it is not enough for the figure to be sculpted from clay and set upright—the drapery, adornment, and environment related to the figure are integral to the work itself.

==Career==

===Bart Wells Institute and Beck&#x27;s Future nomination===

In December 2001, Upritchard co-founded an artist-run space, the Bart Wells Institute, with fellow artist Luke Gottelier in a semi-derelict Hackney warehouse. The Bart Wells Institute ran for about two years and exhibitions were curated by artists including Sam Basu, Brian Griffiths, David Thorpe and Harry Pye.

In 2003 Upritchard was shortlisted for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize for an installation titled &quot;Save Yourself&quot;, now in the Saatchi Gallery collection. The installation, featuring a small mummy figure, wrapped in rags lying on the floor vibrating and moaning, surrounded by canopic jars, was shown at the Bart Wells Institute. The work was seen by Beck&#x27;s Future selector Michael Landy, who nominated it for the award. The work was seen by collector Charles Saatchi and the nomination and acquisition were Upritchard&#x27;s career break-through.

===Walters Prize award===

In 2005 Upritchard had her first exhibition in New Zealand, &quot;Doomed, Doomed, All Doomed&quot; at Artspace, Auckland. The previous year her work had been shown at City Gallery Wellington in the survey exhibition of recent New Zealand contemporary art &quot;Prospect: New New Zealand Art&quot;. &quot;Doomed, Doomed, All Doomed&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Walters Prize, hosted by Auckland Art Gallery and Upritchard was selected as the winner by judge Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev. In her citation Christov-Bakargiev wrote:

I had seen images of Upritchard&#x27;s work, and of some of the other finalists&#x27; works, previous to experiencing this exhibition. But I had never seen the work in the flesh. The difference is astounding. Upritchard&#x27;s work resists photography and reproduction, and this too, in the age of overwhelming communications and surveillance technology, gives me a good feeling, somewhat of an escape route.

===Venice Biennale===

In 2008 New Zealand&#x27;s public arts funding body Creative New Zealand announced that two artists would represent New Zealand at the 2009 Venice Biennale: Upritchard and painter Judy Millar.

Upritchard&#x27;s work for the Biennale consisted of a number of sculptural installations displayed in the former private residence, the Fondazione Claudio Buziol. Titled &quot;Save Yourself&quot;, the works showed dreamy or dancing figures displayed on hand-made tables, mixed with ceramic lamps. It was the first time Upritchard mixed figures and furniture in such a way, an approach which has become a signature aspect of her current work. The figures, handbuilt from polymer clay, stand about 50 centimetres tall. Usually naked, or adorned with handmade and hand-dyed cloaks and textile wrappers, they are painted variously in solid block colours or patterns, including Harlequin blocks and grids. The artist said of these works:

I want to create a visionary landscape, which refers to the hallucinatory works of the medieval painters Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel, and simultaneously draws on the utopian rhetoric of post-sixties counterculture, high modernist futurism and the warped dreams of survivalists, millenarians, and social exiles.

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa acquired the work &quot;Dancers&quot; from the installation for its permanent collection. Two other works, &quot;Horse Man&quot; and &quot;Rainwob Tree&quot;, are in the collection of the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery.

===Collaborative works===

In recent years Upritchard has frequently collaborated with furniture designer Martino Gamper (also her husband) and jeweller Karl Fritsch. In their 2009 exhibition &quot;Feierabend&quot; at Kate Macgarry was an early outing of their collaborative works, mixing Gamper&#x27;s furniture with Upricthard&#x27;s sculpted figures and Fritsch&#x27;s jewellery and objects.

For their 2011 installation &quot;Gesamtkunsthandwerk&quot; for the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery&#x27;s international group exhibition &quot;Stealing the Senses&quot;, Upritchard, Fritsch and Gamper collaborated with other New Zealand artists, most from New Plymouth: weaver Lynne Mackay, potter Nicholas Brandon, bronze-caster Jonathan Campbell, felter Pam Robinson, glass blower Jochen Holz and woodturners Jan Komarkowski and Peter Wales. The exhibition was re-presented at Hamish McKay Gallery in Wellington. The title is a German word meaning &#x27;a total artwork that involves all the parts of the arts and in particular the work of the handmade&#x27;. The artists stated:

We don&#x27;t understand why there needs to be such distinctions amongst art, craft and design. Arts and crafts weren&#x27;t always separated.

We are interested in collapsing hierarchies that operate in language and value.

We feel that we are making work with similar intuition, care and intent.

Upritchard continues to work collaboratively and enlist others in the making of her work, most recently with New Plymouth potter Nicholas Brandon, who was trained by Mirek Smíšek. For her 2016 exhibition &quot;Dark Resters&quot; at Ivan Anthony Gallery in Auckland and the Ilam Campus Gallery at Canterbury University Brandon made ceramic works and glazes that formed part of Upritchard&#x27;s installations, with textiles and her signature figures.

===Public art===

Upritchard&#x27;s first piece of public art is installed in inner-city Auckland on Symonds Street. Titled &quot;Loafers&quot;, the work consists of three bowl-shaped concrete plinths topped with Upritchard&#x27;s idiosyncratic human figures, and several snake forms, cast from bronze. Upritchard has said of these works:

The Loafers plinths reference important ceramic artist Lucie Rie. Rie pioneered domestic-ware in Britain, and her small works were developed at the same time as huge outdoor bronzes and in my mind, share a sort of 1950&#x27;s aesthetic.

In 2022, Upritchard&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; was unveiled for the Sydney Modern Project of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

===Survey exhibition: &quot;Jealous Saboteurs&quot;===

In February 2016 a survey show of the first 20 years&#x27; of Upritchard&#x27;s work, &quot;Francis Upritchard: Jealous Saboteurs&quot;, opened at MUMA (the Monash University Museum of Art, Melbourne). The exhibition was co-curated by MUMA director Charlotte Day and City Gallery Wellington chief curator Robert Leonard. The exhibition opened at City Gallery Wellington in May 2016.

==Publications==

Upritchard&#x27;s own work is informed by her reading, especially in the area of speculative fiction, and the catalogues accompanying her work often feature essays by novelists, including Hari Kunzru, David Mitchell and Ali Smith.

<text>Lucy Skaer (born 1975) is a contemporary English artist who works with sculpture, film, painting, and drawing. Her work has been exhibited internationally. Skaer is a member of the Henry VIII’s Wives artist collective, and has exhibited a number of works with the group.

She currently lives and works in Glasgow and London.

==Early life and education==
Skaer was born in Cambridge. She studied Fine Art at Glasgow School of Art.

==Work==
Lucy Skaer&#x27;s works often depicts relationships between abstraction and the direct material nature of objects. Many of her works are replicas of historical objects which are translated and re-contextualized in new mediums. Skaer&#x27;s work has had a particularly strong engagement with images and historical objects depicting archaeology, ecology, the English landscape, British Empire, and Neolithic architecture as her 2008 installation, &quot;The Siege&quot;.

Much of Skaer&#x27;s work also consists of objects which interact with and change public spaces. In one piece, she took up a paving stone on Glasgow&#x27;s Buchanan Street and then had the Earl of Glasgow ceremoniously lay down a replacement, while in an Amsterdam-based piece, she left a diamond and a scorpion side-by-side on a pavement. She has also secretly hidden moth and butterfly pupae in criminal courts in the hope that they will hatch in mid-trial.
In 2003, Skaer was shortlisted for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize. In 2008, Skaer was the subject of a retrospective of her works since 2001 at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland which included newly commissioned work, and a comprehensive monograph book was published to accompany the show. In April 2009, Skaer was shortlisted for the prestigious Turner Prize for the sculptures &quot;Black Alphabet&quot;, (26 slender sculptures made of coal dust in the shape of Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;Bird in Space&quot;), and &quot;Leviathan Edge&quot;, an installation which included the skull of a sperm whale, drawings, and sculptures. (She lost out to Glasgow-based artist Richard Wright).

Skaer has made a number of 16mm films with the British artist Rosalind Nashashibi including &quot;Flash in the Metropolitan&quot; in 2006, which depicts the artifacts and artworks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as they appeared in a dimmed light of the museum interrupted by the flashes of a strobe. The two have collaborated on the films &quot;Our Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Pygmalion Event,&quot; as well as several others.

<doc id="212229" wikidata="Q7026954" url="?curid=212229" title="Nick Crowe (artist)">
<text>Nick Crowe (born 1968) is an English artist from Yorkshire. He works in a range of raw materials and live comic situations; some of his earlier work is internet-based. He is a Senior Lecturer in Fine Art Practice at Goldsmiths, University of London. Crowe lives in Berlin and works in London and Manchester. You can also find Crowe live streaming on Twitch as he documents his artistic progress in his rustic Berlin countryside barn.

== Biography ==

Crowe was born in Barnsley and studied English literature and drama at Hull University. He began working in experimental theatre and performance in 1989, establishing Index Theatre Co-operative with David Whitaker, Julian Hammond, Jane Gant, Adele Fowles and Les Hampson. Index changed its membership over time, producing innovative performance works.

Crowe then went on to develop his practice in a range of media including film, drawing, new media and etched glass. His art uses a range of strategies including the exploration of the role of technology and its effects on everyday life.

Since the 1990s he was involved in setting up a range of artist-led initiatives including The Annual Programme in Manschester (1995–2000) and The Manchester Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2001–2005). In 2003, he and regular collaborator Ian Rawlinson co-curated Artranpennine03, a trans-regional exhibition of public art.

Several of Crowe&#x27;s pieces are internet-based. &quot;SERVICE 2000&quot;, for example, was a ring of spoof websites for notable art galleries. Other work, like &quot;Discrete Packets&quot; and &quot;Police Radio&quot; use the web as a medium for exploring wider cultural concerns. Crowe also works a great deal in more traditional art media including film and photography as well as installation and publishing. He also produces engraved glass works which deal with subjects as wide as internet memorial web pages and the occupation of Iraq. Some film and video work, uploaded to YouTube has engaged with the pitfalls and possibilities of the online participatory culture with increasingly subtle use of displacement and irony.

In 2003, Chisenhale Gallery commissioned Crowe to produce &quot;Getting On&quot;, a reflection on age, youth and contemporary Britain, that comprised &quot;a group of metallic-finish, scarlet mobility scooters and a soundtrack of Deutsche Grammophon classical pieces. In the same year, Nick Crowe was shortlisted for the Beck&#x27;s Futures prize.

== Crowe &amp; Rawlinson ==

Since 1994 Crowe also has a collaborative practice with Manchester based artist Ian Rawlinson. Together they have worked on many projects using boredom to deal with issues surrounding national identity, politics and faith.

<doc id="212234" wikidata="Q189766" url="?curid=212234" title="Luigi Boccherini">
<text>Ridolfo Luigi Boccherini (, , ; 19 February 1743 – 28 May 1805) was an Italian composer and cellist of the Classical era whose music retained a courtly and &quot;galante&quot; style even while he matured somewhat apart from the major European musical centers. He is best known for a minuet from his String Quintet in E, Op. 11, No. 5 (G 275), and the Cello Concerto in B flat major (G 482). The latter work was long known in the heavily altered version by German cellist and prolific arranger Friedrich Grützmacher, but has recently been restored to its original version.

Boccherini&#x27;s output also includes several guitar quintets. The final movement of the Guitar Quintet No. 4 in D (G 448) is a fandango, a lively Spanish dance.

==Biography==
Boccherini was born into a musical family in Lucca, Italy in 1743. He was the third child of Leopoldo Boccherini, a cellist and double-bass player, and the brother of Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, a poet and dancer who wrote libretti for Antonio Salieri and Joseph Haydn. Luigi received his first music lessons at age five by his father, who taught him cello, and then continued his studies at age nine with Abbé Vanucci, music director of a local cathedral, at San Martino. When his son reached thirteen, Leopoldo Boccherini sent him to study in Rome with Giovanni Battista Costanzi. In 1757 Luigi Boccherini and his father both went to Vienna, where the court employed them as musicians in the Burgtheater.
In 1768 Boccherini went to Madrid, entering in 1770 the employ of Infante Luis Antonio of Spain (1727–1785), younger brother of King Charles III of Spain. There, Boccherini flourished under royal patronage, until one day when the King expressed his disapproval at a passage in a new trio, and ordered Boccherini to change it. The composer, no doubt irritated with this intrusion into his art, doubled the passage instead, which led to his immediate dismissal. Then he accompanied Don Luis (the Infante) to Arenas de San Pedro, a little town in the Gredos Mountains in Ávila; there and in the nearest town of Candeleda Boccherini wrote many of his most famous works.
Later patrons included the French ambassador to Spain, Lucien Bonaparte (1775–1840), as well as King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia (1744–1797), himself an amateur cellist, flautist, and avid supporter of the arts. Boccherini fell on hard times following the deaths of his Spanish patron (1785), his two wives (1785 and 1805), and his four daughters (1796, 1802 and 1804). He died in Madrid in 1805, survived by two sons. His body lay buried in the Pontifical Basilica of St. Michael in Madrid until 1927, when his remains were repatriated and buried in the church of San Francesco in his native Lucca.

==Works==

Much of Boccherini&#x27;s chamber music follows models established by Joseph Haydn; however, Boccherini is often credited with improving Haydn&#x27;s model of the string quartet by bringing the cello to prominence, whereas Haydn had frequently relegated it to an accompaniment role. Some sources for Boccherini&#x27;s style are in the works of a famous Italian cellist, Giovanni Battista Cirri, who was born before Boccherini and before Haydn.

A virtuoso cellist, Boccherini often played violin repertoire on the cello, at pitch, a skill he developed by substituting for ailing violinists while touring. This supreme command of the instrument brought him much praise from his contemporaries (notably Pierre Baillot, Pierre Rode, and Bernhard Romberg), and is evident in the cello parts of his compositions (particularly in the quintets for two cellos, treated often as cello concertos with string quartet accompaniment).

He wrote a large amount of chamber music, including over one hundred string quintets for two violins, viola and two cellos (a type which he pioneered, in contrast with the then common scoring for two violins, two violas and one cello), a dozen guitar quintets, not all of which have survived, nearly a hundred string quartets, and a number of string trios and sonatas (including at least 19 for the cello). His orchestral music includes around 30 symphonies and 12 virtuoso cello concertos.

Boccherini&#x27;s works have been catalogued by the French musicologist Yves Gérard (1932–2020) in the Gérard catalog, published in London (1969), hence the &quot;G&quot; numbers applied to his output.

Boccherini&#x27;s style is characterized by Rococo charm, lightness, and optimism, and exhibits much melodic and rhythmic invention, coupled with frequent influences from the guitar tradition of his adopted country, Spain.

<doc id="212235" wikidata="Q201171" url="?curid=212235" title="Lamb of God">
<text>Lamb of God (; , ) is a title for Jesus that appears in the Gospel of John. It appears at , where John the Baptist sees Jesus and exclaims, &quot;Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.&quot; It appears again in .

Christian doctrine holds that a divine Jesus chose to suffer crucifixion at Calvary to save the world from its sins. He was given up by divine Father, as an &quot;agent and servant of God&quot; in carrying away the sins of the world. In Christian theology the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; is viewed as both foundational and integral to the message of Christianity.

A lion-like lamb that rises to deliver victory after being slain appears several times in the Book of Revelation. It is also referred to in Pauline writings; suggests that Saint Paul intends to refer to the death of Jesus, who is the Paschal Lamb, using the theme found in Johannine writings.

The Lamb of God title is widely used in Christian prayers. The Latin version, , and translations are a standard part of the Catholic Mass, as well as the classical Western Liturgies of the Anglican and Lutheran churches. It is also used in liturgy and as a form of contemplative prayer. The also forms a part of the musical setting for the Mass.

As a visual motif the lamb has been most often represented since the Middle Ages as a standing haloed lamb with a foreleg cocked &quot;holding&quot; a pennant with a red cross on a white ground, though many other ways of representing it have been used.

==Gospel of John==

The title &quot;Lamb of God&quot; for Jesus appears in the Gospel of John, with the initial proclamation: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world&quot; in , the title reaffirmed the next day in . The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two apostles of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as Rabbi with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.

These two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist&#x27;s other : &quot;I have borne witness that this is the Son of God&quot;. From a Christological perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove in reinforce each other to establish the divine element of the Person of Christ. In Johannine Christology the proclamation &quot;who takes away the sin of the world&quot; begins the unfolding of the salvific theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus followed by his resurrection which is built upon in other proclamations such as &quot;this is indeed the Saviour of the world&quot; uttered by the Samaritans in .

==Book of Revelation==
The Book of Revelation includes over twenty-nine references to a lion-like lamb (&quot;slain but standing&quot;) which delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ. In the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation () only the lamb (which is of the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the judgment scroll from God and break the seals. The reference to the lamb in relates it to the Seven Spirits of God which first appear in and are associated with Jesus who holds them along with seven stars.

In Rev. 19:6-9, the lamb is said to be having a wedding feast, and that his bride&#x27;s pure linen garment is said to be the &quot;righteous acts of the saints.&quot; A wedding feast, in Jewish law, is an obligatory banquet after a Jewish wedding. In Jewish eschatology, the messiah will hold a wedding feast with the righteous of every nation (people), called a Seudat Chiyat HaMatim, wherein the messiah and his wedding guests will feast on the flesh of the Leviathan. The identity of the lamb&#x27;s bride is not specified in the passage, but the Christian Church is referred to as the bride of Christ elsewhere in the New Testament.

In the lamb is said to have twelve apostles. The handing of the scroll (i.e. the book containing the names of those who will be saved) to the risen lamb signifies the change in the role of the lamb. In Calvary, the lamb submitted to the will of the Father to be slain, but now is trusted with the judgment of mankind.

From the outset, the book of Revelation is presented as a &quot;revelation of Jesus Christ&quot; and hence the focus on the lamb as both redeemer and judge presents the dual role of Jesus: he redeems man through self-sacrifice, yet calls man to account on the day of judgment.

==Christology==
The concept of the Lamb of God fits well within John&#x27;s &quot;agent Christology&quot;, in which sacrifice is made as an &quot;agent of God&quot; or &quot;servant of God&quot; for the sake of eventual victory.

The theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the Resurrected Christ was employed in early Christology. For example, in 375 Saint Augustine wrote: &quot;Why a lamb in his passion? Because he underwent death without being guilty of any iniquity. Why a lion in his passion? Because in being slain, he slew death. Why a lamb in his resurrection? Because his innocence is everlasting. Why a lion in his resurrection? Because everlasting also is his might.&quot;

The 11th century Christology of Saint Anselm of Canterbury specifically disassociates the Lamb of God from the Old Testament concept of a scapegoat, which is subjected to punishment for the sins of others without knowing it or willing it. Anselm emphasized that as Lamb of God, Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the Father.

John Calvin presented the same Christological view, of &quot;The Lamb as the agent of God&quot;, by arguing that in his trial before Pilate and while at Herod&#x27;s Court Jesus could have argued for his innocence, but instead remained mostly quiet and submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father, for he knew his role as the Lamb of God.

In modern Eastern Orthodox Christology, Sergei Bulgakov argued that the role of Jesus as the Lamb of God was &quot;pre-eternally&quot; determined by the Father, before the creation of the world, by considering the scenario that it would be necessary to send The Son as an agent to redeem humanity disgraced by the fall of Adam, and that this is a sign of His love.
Multiple hypotheses about the suitable symbolism for the Lamb of God have been offered, within various Christological frameworks, ranging from the interpretation of Old Testament references to those of the Book of Revelation. One view suggests the symbolism of Leviticus 16 as scapegoat, coupled with Romans 3:21–25 for atonement, while another view draws parallels with the Paschal Lamb in Exodus 12:1–4, coupled with John 1:29–36, and yet another symbolism relies on Revelation 5:5–14 in which the lamb is viewed as a lion who destroys evil. However, as above, the view adopted by Saint Anselm and John Calvin rejects the scapegoat symbolism. They view Jesus as making a knowing sacrifice as an agent of God, unlike an unwitting scapegoat.

In modern Roman Catholic Christology, Karl Rahner has continued to elaborate on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God, and the water flowing from the side of Christ on Calvary, had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water. In this analogy, the blood of the Lamb washed away the sins of humanity in a new baptism, redeeming it from the fall of Adam.

==Liturgy and music==

In the Mass of the Roman Rite and also in the Eucharist of the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Church, and the Western Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; is the invocation to the Lamb of God sung or recited during the fraction of the Host. It is said to have been introduced into the Mass by Pope Sergius I (687–701).

&quot;Agnus Dei&quot; has been set to music by many composers, usually as part of a Mass setting.

== Art ==
In Christian iconography, an Agnus Dei is a visual representation of Jesus as a lamb, since the Middle Ages, usually carrying a halo and holding a standard or banner with a cross and symbolizing the victory. This normally rests on the lamb&#x27;s shoulder and is held in its right foreleg. Often the cross will have a white banner suspended from it charged with a red cross (similar to St George&#x27;s Cross), though the cross may also be rendered in different colors. Sometimes the lamb is shown lying atop a book with seven seals hanging from it. This is a reference to the imagery in the Book of Revelation , ff. Occasionally, the lamb may be depicted bleeding from the area of the heart (Cf. ), symbolizing Jesus&#x27; shedding of his blood to take away the sins of the world (Cf. , ).

In Early Christian art the symbol appears very early on. Several mosaics in churches include it, some showing a row of twelve sheep representing the apostles flanking the central Agnus Dei, as in Santi Cosma e Damiano, Rome (526–30).
Agnus Dei is standing on a hill with four rivers of Paradise flowing out underneath.

The Moravian Church uses an Agnus Dei as their seal with the surrounding inscription (&quot;Our Lamb has conquered, let us follow him&quot;).

Although the depiction of Jesus as the Lamb of God is of ancient origin, it is not used in the liturgical iconography of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The reason for this is that the depictions of Jesus in the Orthodox Church are anthropomorphic rather than symbolic, as a confession of the Orthodox belief in the Incarnation of the Logos. However, there is no objection to the application of the term &quot;Lamb of God&quot; to Jesus. In fact, the Host used in the Orthodox Divine Liturgy is referred to as the Lamb (; ). In 692 AD the Synod of Constantinople prohibited using a depiction of lamb as a symbol of Christ, a point which was adopted in the East but not the West.

Lamb of God is also part of Easter decorations.

==Heraldry==
A paschal lamb is a charge used in heraldry, for example as the crest of the Davie Baronets, and is blazoned: &quot;a paschal lamb&quot; This charge is depicted as a lamb standing with body facing towards the dexter (viewer&#x27;s left), with nimbus, and with head facing forwards (or turned looking backwards to sinister, termed &quot;reguardant&quot;) holding under its right foreleg a flagpole, tipped with a small cross, resting at a diagonal angle over its shoulder, flying a banner of the Cross of St. George (except in Perth&#x27;s coat of arms, where it flies a banner of the Cross of St Andrew).

== Catholic sacramental ==
In the Roman Catholic Church, an &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; is a disc of wax, stamped with an image of Jesus as a lamb bearing a cross, that is consecrated by the pope as a sacramental. These were often set in jewelry, and might be worn round the neck on a chain, or as a brooch.

<text>John Lenwood McLean (May 17, 1931 – March 31, 2006) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, composer, bandleader, and educator. He is one of the few musicians to be elected to the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame in the year of their death.

==Biography==
McLean was born in Harlem, New York City. His father, John Sr., played guitar in Tiny Bradshaw&#x27;s orchestra. After his father&#x27;s death in 1939, Jackie&#x27;s musical education was continued by his godfather, his record-store-owning stepfather, and several noted teachers. He also received informal tutoring from neighbors Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and Charlie Parker. During high school McLean played in a band with Kenny Drew, Sonny Rollins, and Andy Kirk, Jr. (the saxophonist son of Andy Kirk).

Along with Rollins, McLean played on Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Dig&quot; album when he was 20 years old. As a young man he also recorded with Gene Ammons, Charles Mingus (for &quot;Pithecanthropus Erectus&quot;), George Wallington, and as a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers. McLean joined Blakey after reportedly being punched by Mingus. Fearing for his life, McLean pulled out a knife and contemplated using it against Mingus in self-defense, but later stated he was grateful that he had not stabbed the bassist.

McLean&#x27;s early recordings as leader were in the hard bop school. He later became an exponent of modal jazz without abandoning his foundation in hard bop. Throughout his career he was known for a distinctive tone, akin to the tenor saxophone and often described with such adjectives as &quot;bittersweet&quot;, &quot;piercing&quot;, or &quot;searing&quot;, a slightly sharp pitch, and a strong foundation in the blues.

McLean was a heroin addict throughout his early career, and the resulting loss of his New York City cabaret card forced him to undertake a large number of recording dates to earn income in the absence of nightclub performance opportunities. Consequently, he produced an extensive body of recorded work in the 1950s and 1960s. He was under contract with Blue Note Records from 1959 to 1967, having previously recorded for Prestige. Blue Note offered better pay and more artistic control than other labels, and his work for this organization is highly regarded and includes leadership and sideman dates with a wide range of musicians, including Donald Byrd, Sonny Clark, Lee Morgan, Ornette Coleman, Dexter Gordon, Freddie Redd, Billy Higgins, Freddie Hubbard, Grachan Moncur III, Bobby Hutcherson, Mal Waldron, Tina Brooks and many others.

In 1962, he recorded &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; for Blue Note. This album was the culmination of attempts he had made over the years to deal with harmonic problems in jazz, incorporating ideas from the free jazz developments of Ornette Coleman and the &quot;new breed&quot; which inspired his blending of hard bop with the &quot;new thing&quot;: &quot;the search is on, Let Freedom Ring&quot;. &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; began a period in which he performed with avant-garde jazz musicians rather than the veteran hard bop performers he had been playing with previously. His adaptation of modal jazz and free jazz innovations to his vision of hard bop made his recordings from 1962 on distinctive.

McLean recorded with dozens of musicians and had a gift for spotting talent. Saxophonist Tina Brooks, trumpeter Charles Tolliver, pianist Larry Willis, trumpeter Bill Hardman, and tubist Ray Draper were among those who benefited from McLean&#x27;s support in the 1950s and 1960s. Drummers such as Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette, Lenny White, Michael Carvin, and Carl Allen gained important early experience with McLean.

In 1967, his recording contract, like those of many other progressive musicians, was terminated by Blue Note&#x27;s new management. His opportunities to record promised so little pay that he abandoned recording as a way to earn a living, concentrating instead on touring. In 1968, he began teaching at The Hartt School of the University of Hartford. He later set up the university&#x27;s African American Music Department (now the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz) and its Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Studies program. His Steeplechase recording &quot;New York Calling&quot;, made with his son René McLean, showed that by 1980 the assimilation of all influences was complete.

In 1970, he and his wife, Dollie McLean, along with jazz bassist Paul (PB) Brown, founded the Artists Collective, Inc. of Hartford, an organization dedicated to preserving the art and culture of the African Diaspora. It provides educational programs and instruction in dance, theatre, music and visual arts. The membership of McLean&#x27;s later bands were drawn from his students in Hartford, including Steve Davis and his son René, who is a jazz saxophonist and flautist as well as a jazz educator. Also in McLean&#x27;s Hartford group was Mark Berman, the jazz pianist and broadway conductor of Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe and Rent. In 1979 he reached No. 53 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Doctor Jackyll and Mister Funk&quot;. This track, released on RCA as a 12&quot; single, was an unusual sidestep for McLean to contribute towards the funk/disco revolution of the late 1970s. Many people, at the time, in the clubs where it was played confused the female singers on the track with his name thinking he was actually female.

He received an American Jazz Masters fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2001 and numerous other national and international awards. McLean was the only American jazz musician to found a department of studies at a university and a community-based organization almost simultaneously. Each has existed for over three decades.

McLean died on March 31, 2006, in Hartford, Connecticut, after a long illness. In 2006 he was elected to the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame via the International Critics Poll. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York City, with an image of him playing the saxophone, etched in black granite, high on a hill.

A. B. Spellman&#x27;s 1966 study, &quot;Black Music, Four Lives: Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, Herbie Nichols, Jackie McLean&quot;, still in print, includes extensive mid-career reflections by McLean on his youth and career to date. Derek Ansell&#x27;s full-length biography of McLean, &quot;Sugar Free Saxophone&quot;. details the story of his career and provides a full analysis of his music on record.

<doc id="212238" wikidata="Q1338080" url="?curid=212238" title="Tom Pendergast">
<text>Thomas Joseph Pendergast (July 22, 1872 – January 26, 1945), also known as T. J. Pendergast, was an American political boss who controlled Kansas City and Jackson County, Missouri, from 1925 to 1939.

Pendergast only briefly held elected office, as an alderman, but his capacity as chairman of the Jackson County Democratic Party allowed him to use his large network of Irish family and friends to help the election of politicians, in some cases by voter fraud, and to hand out government contracts and patronage jobs. He became wealthy in the process, but his addiction to gambling, especially horse racing, later led to a large accumulation of personal debts.

In 1939, he was convicted of income tax evasion and served 15 months in a federal prison. The Pendergast organization helped to launch the political career of future president Harry S. Truman, which caused Truman&#x27;s early enemies to dub him &quot;the senator from Pendergast&quot;.

==Early years==
Thomas Joseph Pendergast, also known to close friends as &quot;TJ&quot;, was born in St. Joseph, Missouri. Raised as a Catholic, he had nine brothers and sisters. The family&#x27;s name is misspelled as Pendergest in the 1880 census and is listed accordingly.

In the 1890s, the young Tom Pendergast worked in his older brother James Pendergast&#x27;s West Bottoms tavern. The West Bottoms were then an immigrant section of town located at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River above which spread the more prosperous sections of Kansas City. James Pendergast, an alderman in Kansas City&#x27;s city council, tutored him in the diversities of the city&#x27;s political ways and systems and in the strategic advantages of controlling blocs of voters. James retired in 1910 and died the next year after he had named Tom as his successor. After his brother&#x27;s death, Tom Pendergast served in the city council until he stepped down in 1916 to focus on consolidating the factions of the Jackson County Democratic Party.

In 1925 a new city charter was passed that placed the city under the auspices of a city manager picked by a smaller council. Though the charter had been intended to free Kansas City of political bossism, Pendergast&#x27;s candidates were able to win five of the nine seats on the council, allowing Pendergast to gain control of the city government.

Pendergast married Caroline Snyder in February 1911 and raised three children (two girls and a boy) at their home on 5650 Ward Parkway. He was a member of the Knight of Columbus, which used his connection to reach Truman during the 1930s persecution of Catholics and others in Mexico.

==Chairman of Jackson County Democratic Club==
Pendergast ruled from a simple two-story yellow brick building at 1908 Main Street. Messages marked with his red scrawl were used to secure all manner of favors. He was unquestionably corrupt, and there were regularly shootouts and beatings on election days during his watch. However, the permissive go-go days also gave rise to the golden era of Kansas City jazz (now commemorated at the American Jazz Museum at 18th and Vine) as well as a golden era of building in Kansas City. Pendergast tried to portray a &quot;common touch&quot; and made attention-grabbing displays of helping pay medical bills, providing &quot;jobs&quot;, and hosting famous Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for the poor. Fraud and intimidation often caused Kansas City voter turnout to be close to 100 percent in the Pendergast days.

Despite Prohibition, Pendergast&#x27;s machine and a bribed police force allowed alcohol and gambling. Additionally, many elections were fixed to keep political friends in power. In return, Pendergast&#x27;s companies like Ready-Mixed Concrete were awarded government contracts. Under a $40 million bond program, the city constructed many civic buildings during the Depression. Among the projects were the Jackson County Courthouse, in Downtown Kansas City, and the concrete &quot;paving&quot; of Brush Creek, near the Country Club Plaza. (A local urban legend, in which bodies of Pendergast opponents were thought to be buried under the Brush Creek concrete, was finally put to rest when the concrete was torn up for a renewal project in the 1980s, and no bodies were found.) Pendergast also had a hand in other projects like the Power and Light Building, Fidelity Bank and Trust Building, Municipal Auditorium, and the construction of inner-city high schools.

Pendergast placed many of his associates in positions of authority throughout Jackson County and exercised strong influence in determining the Democratic candidates for statewide office. For example, he picked Guy Brasfield Park as the Democratic candidate for Missouri governor in 1932 after the previous candidate, Francis Wilson, died two weeks before the election. Pendergast also extended his rule into neighboring cities such as Omaha, Nebraska, and Wichita, Kansas, where members of his family had set up branches of the Ready-Mixed Concrete company. The Pendergast stamp was to be found in the packing plant industries, local politics, bogus construction contracts, and the jazz scene in those cities as well.

==Downfall and later years==
Pendergast&#x27;s downfall was related to a falling out with Missouri Governor Lloyd C. Stark. Pendergast had endorsed Stark, the heir to an agricultural fortune and known for promoting the Golden Delicious variety of apples, for governor in 1936. Pendergast was out of the country during the election, and his followers were even more obvious and corrupt than usual in Stark&#x27;s successful election. With Mafia-related shootings and election violence underway in Jackson County, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. went after a Mafia boss, Charles Carrollo, and Pendergast as part of Morgenthau&#x27;s crackdown on corruption and organized crime. Despite Pendergast&#x27;s history of delivering votes for Roosevelt and other leading Democrats, Morgenthau directed his subordinates to &quot;let the chips fall where they may&quot;. With investigations looming, Stark turned against Pendergast, which prompted federal investigations and the pulling of federal funds from Pendergast&#x27;s control. In 1939 Edward L. Schneider, the secretary-treasurer of eight of the Pendergast businesses, killed himself.

Another factor in the downfall was Pendergast&#x27;s failing health. Shortly after attending the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in 1936, he was taken ill and later diagnosed with colon cancer and was in poor health for the remainder of his life. In 1939, Pendergast was arraigned for failing to pay taxes on a bribe received to pay off gambling debts. After serving 15 months in prison at the nearby United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, he lived quietly at his home, 5650 Ward Parkway, in his later years. Pendergast died on January 26, 1945, at Menorah Medical Center, which at the time was located in Kansas City, Missouri. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City.

Pendergast&#x27;s headquarters at 1908 Main is listed on the Kansas City Register of Historic Places.

==Truman connection==
During his military service during World War I, Harry Truman had become close friends with Jim Pendergast, T. J.&#x27;s nephew. When Truman&#x27;s attempt at a clothing business failed in 1922, Jim Pendergast suggested that he run for a &quot;judgeship&quot; in eastern Jackson County (actually an administrative, rather than a judicial position). With the help of the Pendergast organization, Truman was elected to that and later to a similar county-wide position. In 1934, after several other potential candidates turned him down, T. J. was persuaded to support Truman, whom he considered something of a lightweight, for the Democratic nomination for a US Senate seat. Truman prevailed in a close primary and went on to win in the general election. Although Truman was derisively named &quot;the senator from Pendergast&quot; by his opponents, he does not appear to have had a close personal relationship with Pendergast himself. Both men met on only a handful of occasions and were photographed together only once, at the 1936 Democratic Party convention.

After Pendergast was convicted of income tax evasion, Missouri Governor Lloyd C. Stark sought to unseat Truman in the 1940 US Senate election. It was a very bitter campaign, which made both men lifelong enemies. Truman was re-elected after US Attorney Maurice Milligan, who had prosecuted Pendergast, also entered the race, which caused Milligan and Stark to split the anti-Pendergast vote.

In his second term as Senator, with Pendergast out of power and World War II underway, Truman was finally able to shake his association with the Pendergast machine and build a national reputation as a military spending reformer. In early 1945, the newly-inaugurated Vice President shocked many when he attended the Pendergast funeral. He was reportedly the only elected official who attended. Truman brushed aside the criticism and said simply: &quot;He was always my friend and I have always been his.&quot; On April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office and Pendergast&#x27;s one-time protégé became the 33rd President of the United States.

==Legacy==
Two of his biographers have summed up Pendergast&#x27;s uniqueness as a political boss:

Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.

<doc id="212240" wikidata="Q79749" url="?curid=212240" title="Blood plasma">
<text>Blood plasma is a light amber-colored liquid component of blood in which blood cells are absent, but which contains proteins and other constituents of whole blood in suspension. It makes up about 55% of the body&#x27;s total blood volume. It is the intravascular part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains important dissolved proteins (6–8%; e.g., serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (, , , , , etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and oxygen. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte concentration balanced and protects the body from infection and other blood-related disorders.

Blood plasma can be separated from whole blood through blood fractionation, by adding an anticoagulant to a tube filled with blood, which is spun in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off. For point-of-care testing applications, plasma can be extracted from whole blood via filtration or via agglutination to allow for rapid testing of specific biomarkers. Blood plasma has a density of approximately . Blood serum is blood plasma without clotting factors. Plasmapheresis is a medical therapy that involves blood plasma extraction, treatment, and reintegration.
Fresh frozen plasma is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is of critical importance in the treatment of many types of trauma which result in blood loss, and is therefore kept stocked universally in all medical facilities capable of treating trauma (e.g., trauma centers, hospitals, and ambulances) or that pose a risk of patient blood loss such as surgical suite facilities. 

==Volume==
Blood plasma volume may be expanded by or drained to extravascular fluid when there are changes in Starling forces across capillary walls. For example, when blood pressure drops in circulatory shock, Starling forces drive fluid into the interstitium, causing third spacing.

Standing still for a prolonged period will cause an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. As a result, approximately 12% of blood plasma volume will cross into the extravascular compartment. This plasma shift causes an increase in hematocrit, serum total protein, blood viscosity and, as a result of increased concentration of coagulation factors, it causes orthostatic hypercoagulability.

==Plasma proteins==
=== Albumins ===
Serum albumins are the most common plasma proteins, and they are responsible for maintaining the osmotic pressure of the blood. Without albumins, the consistency of blood would be closer to that of water. The increased viscosity of blood prevents fluid from entering the bloodstream from outside the capillaries. Albumins are produced in the liver, assuming the absence of a hepatocellular deficiency.

=== Globulins ===

The second most common type of protein in the blood plasma are globulins. Important globulins include immunoglobins which are important for the immune system and transport hormones and other compounds around the body. There are three main types of globulins. Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 globulins are formed in the liver and play an important role in mineral transport and the inhibition of blood coagulation. An example of beta globulin found in blood plasma includes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) which are responsible for transporting fat to the cells for steroid and membrane synthesis. Gamma globulin, better known as immunoglobulins, are produced by plasma B cells, and provides the human body with a defense system against invading pathogens and other immune diseases.

=== Fibrinogen ===

Fibrinogen proteins make up most of the remaining proteins in the blood. Fibrinogens are responsible for clotting blood to help prevent blood loss.

== Color ==

Plasma is normally yellow due to bilirubin, carotenoids, hemoglobin, and transferrin. In abnormal cases, plasma can have varying shades of orange, green, or brown. The green color can be due to ceruloplasmin or sulfhemoglobin. The latter may form due to medicines that are able to form sulfonamides once ingested. A dark brown or reddish color can appear due to hemolysis, in which methemoglobin is released from broken blood cells. Plasma is normally relatively transparent, but sometimes it can be opaque. Opaqueness is typically due to elevated content of lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides.

== Plasma vs. serum in medical diagnostics ==
Plasma and serum are both derived from full blood, but serum is obtained by removing blood cells, fibrin clots, and other coagulation factors while plasma is obtained by only removing blood cells. Blood plasma and blood serum are often used in blood tests. Tests can be done on plasma, serum or both. In addition, some tests have to be done with whole blood, such as the determination of the amount of blood cells in blood via flow cytometry.

=== Benefits of plasma over serum ===
Plasma preparation is quick, as it is not coagulated. Serum sample preparation requires about 30 minutes of waiting time before it can be centrifuged and then analyzed. However, coagulation can be hastened down to a few minutes by adding thrombin or similar agents to the serum sample.

Compared to serum, 15–20% larger volume of plasma can be obtained from a blood sample of certain size. Serum lacks some proteins that partake in coagulation and increase the sample volume.

Serum preparation can cause measurement errors by increasing or decreasing the concentration of the analyte that is meant to be measured. For example, during coagulation, blood cells consume blood glucose and platelets increase the sample content of compounds like potassium, phosphates and aspartate transaminase by secreting them. Glucose or these other compounds may be the analytes.

=== Benefits of serum over plasma ===
Plasma preparation requires the addition of anticoagulants, which can cause expected and unexpected measurement errors. For example, anticoagulant salts can add extra cations like NH4+, Li+, Na+ and K+ to the sample, or impurities like lead and aluminum. Chelator anticoagulants like EDTA and citrate salts work by binding calcium (see carboxyglutamic acid), but they may also bind other ions. Even if such ions are not the analytes, chelators can interfere with enzyme activity measurements. For example, EDTA binds zinc ions, which alkaline phosphatases need as cofactors. Thus, phosphatase activity cannot be measured if EDTA is used.

An unknown volume of anticoagulants can be added to a plasma sample by accident, which may ruin the sample as the analyte concentration is changed by an unknown amount.

No anticoagulants are added to serum samples, which decreases the preparation cost of the samples relative to plasma samples.

Plasma samples can form tiny clots if the added anticoagulant is not properly mixed with the sample. Non-uniform samples can cause measurement errors.

==History==
Plasma was already well known when described by William Harvey in &quot;de Motu Cordis&quot; in 1628, but knowledge of it probably dates as far back as Vesalius (1514–1564). The discovery of fibrinogen by William Henson, , made it easier to study plasma, as ordinarily, upon coming in contact with a foreign surface – something other than the vascular endothelium – clotting factors become activated and clotting proceeds rapidly, trapping RBCs etc. in the plasma and preventing separation of plasma from the blood. Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Upon the formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is blood serum, which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors

The use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. &quot;Dried plasmas&quot; in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in World War II. Prior to the United States&#x27; involvement in the war, liquid plasma and whole blood were used.

=== The origin of plasmapheresis ===
Dr. José Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain, founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940. Dr. Grifols pioneered a first-of-its-kind technique called &quot;plasmapheresis&quot;, where a donor&#x27;s red blood cells would be returned to the donor&#x27;s body almost immediately after the separation of the blood plasma. This technique is still in practice today, almost 80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world&#x27;s first plasma donation center.

===Blood for Britain=== 
The &quot;Blood for Britain&quot; program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on Charles Drew&#x27;s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the &quot;Plasma for Britain&quot; project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the test tube methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.

Nevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler. The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours. The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.

Following the Supplying Blood Plasma to England project, Drew was named director of the Red Cross blood bank and assistant director of the National Research Council, in charge of blood collection for the United States Army and Navy. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the race of the donor. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for &quot;same race&quot; blood.

By the end of the war the American Red Cross had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. Serum albumin replaced dried plasma for combat use during the Korean War.

==Plasma donation==

Plasma as a blood product prepared from blood donations is used in blood transfusions, typically as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or Plasma Frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy (PF24). When donating whole blood or packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, O- is the most desirable and is considered a &quot;universal donor,&quot; since it has neither A nor B antigens and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the &quot;universal recipient&quot; type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through apheresis, as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the &quot;universal donor&quot; for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies. However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.

=== United Kingdom ===
Following fears of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began to phase out blood plasma from U.K. donors and by the end of 1999 had imported all blood products made with plasma from the United States. In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated, an American blood supply company, to import plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned Bio Products Laboratory. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth £200 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK. In 2009, the U.K. stopped importing plasma from the United States, as it was no longer a viable option due to regulatory and jurisdictional challenges.

At present (2024), blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However, plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma medicines.

==Synthetic blood plasma==
Simulated body fluid (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma. SBF is normally used for the surface modification of metallic implants, and more recently in gene delivery application.

<text>Electricity retailing is the final sale of electricity from generation to the end-use consumer. This is the fourth major step in the electricity delivery process, which also includes generation, transmission and distribution.

== Beginnings==

Electricity retailing began at the end of the 19th century when the bodies which generated electricity for their own use made supply available to third parties. In the beginning, electricity was primarily used for street lighting and trams. The public could buy once large scale
electric companies had been started.

The provision of these services was generally the responsibility of electric companies or municipal authorities who either set up their own departments or contracted the services from private entrepreneurs. Residential, commercial and industrial use of electricity was confined, initially, to lighting but this changed dramatically with the development of electric motors, heaters and communication devices.

The basic principle of supply has not changed much over time. The amount of energy used by the domestic consumer, and thus the amount charged for, is measured through an electricity meter that is usually placed near the input of a home to provide easy access to the meter reader.

Customers are usually charged a monthly service fee and additional charges based on the electrical energy (in kWh) consumed by the household or business during the month. Commercial and industrial consumers normally have more complex pricing schemes. These require meters that measure the energy usage in time intervals (such as a half-hour) to impose charges based on both the amount of energy consumed and the maximum rate of consumption, i.e. the maximum demand. This is usually called peak demand charge. Frequent reporting also allows the retailer to pass on the spot price (with some markup) to its customers.

== Monopoly supply ==

The rapid growth in electric appliance usage in the early part of the 20th century contributed to an explosive growth in electrification around the world.

The supply of electricity to homes, offices, shops, factories, farms, and mines became the responsibility of public utilities, which were either private organizations subject to monopoly regulation or public authorities owned by local, state or national bodies.

In some countries a statutory or government-granted monopoly was created to be controlled by legislation, for example Eskom in South Africa.
Electricity retailing in the period from approximately 1890 to 1990 consisted of managing the connection, disconnection and billing of electricity consumers by the local monopoly supplier.

In many utilities there was a marketing function which encouraged electricity usage when there was excess capacity to supply and encouraged conservation when supply was tight.

== Creating a market ==

An electricity provider is often known as &quot;the electric company&quot; or &quot;the power company&quot;.

In 1990 there was a significant development in the way electricity was bought and sold. In many countries, the electricity market was deregulated to open up the supply of electricity to competition. In the United Kingdom the electricity supply industry was radically reformed to establish competition, including a market in advising users about switching supplier. This trend continued in other countries (see New Zealand Electricity Market and deregulation) and the role of electricity retailing changed from what was essentially an administrative function within an integrated utility to become a risk management function within a competitive electricity market.

Electricity retailers now offer fixed prices or variable for electricity to their customers and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. This development has not been without casualties. The most notable example of poor risk management (coupled with poor market regulation) was the 2001 California electricity crisis, when Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison were driven into bankruptcy by having to purchase electricity at high spot prices and sell at low fixed rates.

Customers may choose from a number of competing suppliers. They may also opt to purchase &quot;green&quot; power, i.e. electricity sourced from renewable energy generation such as wind power or solar power.

==United States==

Over the past several decades, many US states have moved to deregulate their electric markets, with 24 states allowing for at least some competition among retail electric providers (REPs) including California, Texas, and New York. Deregulation of electric retailers has been subject to much controversy as more states have opted for competitive markets.

<doc id="212250" wikidata="Q746083" url="?curid=212250" title="Homotopy">
<text>In topology, two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic (from &quot;same, similar&quot; and &quot;place&quot;) if one can be &quot;continuously deformed&quot; into the other, such a deformation being called a homotopy (, ; , ) between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of homotopy groups and cohomotopy groups, important invariants in algebraic topology.

In practice, there are technical difficulties in using homotopies with certain spaces. Algebraic topologists work with compactly generated spaces, CW complexes, or spectra.

==Formal definition==

Formally, a homotopy between two continuous functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; from a 
topological space &quot;X&quot; to a topological space &quot;Y&quot; is defined to be a continuous function formula_1 from the product of the space &quot;X&quot; with the unit interval [0, 1] to &quot;Y&quot; such that formula_2 and formula_3 for all formula_4. 

If we think of the second parameter of &quot;H&quot; as time then &quot;H&quot; describes a &quot;continuous deformation&quot; of &quot;f&quot; into &quot;g&quot;: at time 0 we have the function &quot;f&quot; and at time 1 we have the function &quot;g&quot;. We can also think of the second parameter as a &quot;slider control&quot; that allows us to smoothly transition from &quot;f&quot; to &quot;g&quot; as the slider moves from 0 to 1, and vice versa.

An alternative notation is to say that a homotopy between two continuous functions formula_5 is a family of continuous functions formula_6 for formula_7 such that formula_8 and formula_9, and the map formula_10 is continuous from formula_11 to formula_12. The two versions coincide by setting formula_13. It is not sufficient to require each map formula_14 to be continuous.

The animation that is looped above right provides an example of a homotopy between two embeddings, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, of the torus into . &quot;X&quot; is the torus, &quot;Y&quot; is , &quot;f&quot; is some continuous function from the torus to &quot;R&quot;3 that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-doughnut shape with which the animation starts; &quot;g&quot; is some continuous function that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-coffee-mug shape. The animation shows the image of &quot;h&quot;&quot;t&quot;(X) as a function of the parameter &quot;t&quot;, where &quot;t&quot; varies with time from 0 to 1 over each cycle of the animation loop. It pauses, then shows the image as &quot;t&quot; varies back from 1 to 0, pauses, and repeats this cycle.

===Properties===

Continuous functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are said to be homotopic if and only if there is a homotopy &quot;H&quot; taking &quot;f&quot; to &quot;g&quot; as described above. Being homotopic is an equivalence relation on the set of all continuous functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. 
This homotopy relation is compatible with function composition in the following sense: if are homotopic, and are homotopic, then their compositions and are also homotopic.

== Examples ==
* If formula_15 are given by formula_16 and formula_17, then the map formula_18 given by formula_19 is a homotopy between them.
* More generally, if formula_20 is a convex subset of Euclidean space and formula_21 are paths with the same endpoints, then there is a linear homotopy (or straight-line homotopy) given by 
*: formula_22
* Let formula_23 be the identity function on the unit &quot;n&quot;-disk; i.e. the set formula_24. Let formula_25 be the constant function formula_26 which sends every point to the origin. Then the following is a homotopy between them:
*: formula_27

==Homotopy equivalence==
Given two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, a homotopy equivalence between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is a pair of continuous maps and , such that is homotopic to the identity map id&quot;X&quot; and is homotopic to id&quot;Y&quot;. If such a pair exists, then &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are said to be homotopy equivalent, or of the same homotopy type. This relation of homotopy equivalence is often denoted formula_28. Intuitively, two spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are homotopy equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by bending, shrinking and expanding operations. Spaces that are homotopy-equivalent to a point are called contractible.

=== Homotopy equivalence vs. homeomorphism ===
A homeomorphism is a special case of a homotopy equivalence, in which is equal to the identity map id&quot;X&quot; (not only homotopic to it), and is equal to id&quot;Y&quot;. Therefore, if X and Y are homeomorphic then they are homotopy-equivalent, but the opposite is not true. Some examples:

* A solid disk is homotopy-equivalent to a single point, since you can deform the disk along radial lines continuously to a single point. However, they are not homeomorphic, since there is no bijection between them (since one is an infinite set, while the other is finite).
* The Möbius strip and an untwisted (closed) strip are homotopy equivalent, since you can deform both strips continuously to a circle. But they are not homeomorphic.

=== Examples ===
* The first example of a homotopy equivalence is formula_29 with a point, denoted formula_30. The part that needs to be checked is the existence of a homotopy formula_31 between formula_32 and formula_33, the projection of formula_29 onto the origin. This can be described as formula_35.
* There is a homotopy equivalence between formula_36 (the 1-sphere) and formula_37.
** More generally, formula_38.
* Any fiber bundle formula_39 with fibers formula_40 homotopy equivalent to a point has homotopy equivalent total and base spaces. This generalizes the previous two examples since formula_41 is a fiber bundle with fiber formula_42.
* Every vector bundle is a fiber bundle with a fiber homotopy equivalent to a point.
* formula_43 for any formula_44, by writing formula_45 as the total space of the fiber bundle formula_46, then applying the homotopy equivalences above.
* If a subcomplex formula_47 of a CW complex formula_48 is contractible, then the quotient space formula_49 is homotopy equivalent to formula_48.
* A deformation retraction is a homotopy equivalence.

===Null-homotopy===
A function formula_51 is said to be null-homotopic if it is homotopic to a constant function. (The homotopy from formula_51 to a constant function is then sometimes called a null-homotopy.) For example, a map formula_51 from the unit circle formula_36 to any space formula_48 is null-homotopic precisely when it can be continuously extended to a map from the unit disk formula_56 to formula_48 that agrees with formula_51 on the boundary.

It follows from these definitions that a space formula_48 is contractible if and only if the identity map from formula_48 to itself—which is always a homotopy equivalence—is null-homotopic.

==Invariance==
Homotopy equivalence is important because in algebraic topology many concepts are homotopy invariant, that is, they respect the relation of homotopy equivalence. For example, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are homotopy equivalent spaces, then:
* &quot;X&quot; is path-connected if and only if &quot;Y&quot; is.
* &quot;X&quot; is simply connected if and only if &quot;Y&quot; is.
* The (singular) homology and cohomology groups of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic.
* If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are path-connected, then the fundamental groups of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic, and so are the higher homotopy groups. (Without the path-connectedness assumption, one has π1(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;x&quot;0) isomorphic to π1(&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0)) where is a homotopy equivalence and 

An example of an algebraic invariant of topological spaces which is not homotopy-invariant is compactly supported homology (which is, roughly speaking, the homology of the compactification, and compactification is not homotopy-invariant).

== Variants ==

===Relative homotopy===

In order to define the fundamental group, one needs the notion of homotopy relative to a subspace. These are homotopies which keep the elements of the subspace fixed. Formally: if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are continuous maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;K&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, then we say that &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are homotopic relative to &quot;K&quot; if there exists a homotopy between &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; such that for all and Also, if &quot;g&quot; is a retraction from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;K&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is the identity map, this is known as a strong deformation retract of &quot;X&quot; to &quot;K&quot;.
When &quot;K&quot; is a point, the term pointed homotopy is used.

=== Isotopy ===

When two given continuous functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; from the topological space &quot;X&quot; to the topological space &quot;Y&quot; are embeddings, one can ask whether they can be connected &#x27;through embeddings&#x27;. This gives rise to the concept of isotopy, which is a homotopy, &quot;H&quot;, in the notation used before, such that for each fixed &quot;t&quot;, &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) gives an embedding.

A related, but different, concept is that of ambient isotopy.

Requiring that two embeddings be isotopic is a stronger requirement than that they be homotopic. For example, the map from the interval [−1, 1] into the real numbers defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = −&quot;x&quot; is &quot;not&quot; isotopic to the identity &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;. Any homotopy from &quot;f&quot; to the identity would have to exchange the endpoints, which would mean that they would have to &#x27;pass through&#x27; each other. Moreover, &quot;f&quot; has changed the orientation of the interval and &quot;g&quot; has not, which is impossible under an isotopy. However, the maps are homotopic; one homotopy from &quot;f&quot; to the identity is &quot;H&quot;: [−1, 1] × [0, 1] → [−1, 1] given by &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 2&quot;yx&quot; − &quot;x&quot;.

Two homeomorphisms (which are special cases of embeddings) of the unit ball which agree on the boundary can be shown to be isotopic using Alexander&#x27;s trick. For this reason, the map of the unit disc in formula_61 defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = (−&quot;x&quot;, −&quot;y&quot;) is isotopic to a 180-degree rotation around the origin, and so the identity map and &quot;f&quot; are isotopic because they can be connected by rotations.

In geometric topology—for example in knot theory—the idea of isotopy is used to construct equivalence relations. For example, when should two knots be considered the same? We take two knots, &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2, in three-dimensional space. A knot is an embedding of a one-dimensional space, the &quot;loop of string&quot; (or the circle), into this space, and this embedding gives a homeomorphism between the circle and its image in the embedding space. The intuitive idea behind the notion of knot equivalence is that one can &quot;deform&quot; one embedding to another through a path of embeddings: a continuous function starting at &quot;t&quot; = 0 giving the &quot;K&quot;1 embedding, ending at &quot;t&quot; = 1 giving the &quot;K&quot;2 embedding, with all intermediate values corresponding to embeddings. This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. An ambient isotopy, studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2 are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves &quot;K&quot;1 to &quot;K&quot;2. This is the appropriate definition in the topological category.

Similar language is used for the equivalent concept in contexts where one has a stronger notion of equivalence. For example, a path between two smooth embeddings is a smooth isotopy.

=== Timelike homotopy ===
On a Lorentzian manifold, certain curves are distinguished as timelike (representing something that only goes forwards, not backwards, in time, in every local frame). A timelike homotopy between two timelike curves is a homotopy such that the curve remains timelike during the continuous transformation from one curve to another. No closed timelike curve (CTC) on a Lorentzian manifold is timelike homotopic to a point (that is, null timelike homotopic); such a manifold is therefore said to be multiply connected by timelike curves. A manifold such as the 3-sphere can be simply connected (by any type of curve), and yet be timelike multiply connected.

== Properties ==

=== Lifting and extension properties ===

If we have a homotopy and a cover and we are given a map such that (&quot;h&quot;0 is called a lift of &quot;h&quot;0), then we can lift all &quot;H&quot; to a map such that The homotopy lifting property is used to characterize fibrations.

Another useful property involving homotopy is the homotopy extension property,
which characterizes the extension of a homotopy between two functions from a subset of some set to the set itself. It is useful when dealing with cofibrations.

===Groups===
Since the relation of two functions formula_62 being homotopic relative to a subspace is an equivalence relation, we can look at the equivalence classes of maps between a fixed &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. If we fix formula_63, the unit interval [0, 1] crossed with itself &quot;n&quot; times, and we take its boundary formula_64 as a subspace, then the equivalence classes form a group, denoted formula_65, where formula_66 is in the image of the subspace formula_64.

We can define the action of one equivalence class on another, and so we get a group. These groups are called the homotopy groups. In the case formula_68, it is also called the fundamental group.

===Homotopy category===

The idea of homotopy can be turned into a formal category of category theory. The homotopy category is the category whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps. Two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic in this category if and only if they are homotopy-equivalent. Then a functor on the category of topological spaces is homotopy invariant if it can be expressed as a functor on the homotopy category.

For example, homology groups are a &quot;functorial&quot; homotopy invariant: this means that if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; are homotopic, then the group homomorphisms induced by &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; on the level of homology groups are the same: H&quot;n&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = H&quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) : H&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → H&quot;n&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;. Likewise, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are in addition path connected, and the homotopy between &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is pointed, then the group homomorphisms induced by &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; on the level of homotopy groups are also the same: π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) : π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;).

==Applications==
Based on the concept of the homotopy, computation methods for algebraic and differential equations have been developed. The methods for algebraic equations include the homotopy continuation method and the continuation method (see numerical continuation). The methods for differential equations include the homotopy analysis method.

Homotopy theory can be used as a foundation for homology theory: one can represent a cohomology functor on a space &quot;X&quot; by mappings of &quot;X&quot; into an appropriate fixed space, up to homotopy equivalence. For example, for any abelian group &quot;G&quot;, and any based CW-complex &quot;X&quot;, the set formula_69 of based homotopy classes of based maps from &quot;X&quot; to the Eilenberg–MacLane space formula_70 is in natural bijection with the &quot;n&quot;-th singular cohomology group formula_71 of the space &quot;X&quot;. One says that the omega-spectrum of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are representing spaces for singular cohomology with coefficients in &quot;G&quot;. Using this fact, homotopy classes between a CW complex and a multiply connected space can be calculated using cohomology as described by the Hopf–Whitney theorem.

<doc id="212253" wikidata="Q844861" url="?curid=212253" title="Electric power distribution">
<text>Electric power distribution is the final stage in the delivery of electricity. Electricity is carried from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between and with the use of transformers. &quot;Primary&quot; distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer&#x27;s premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment and household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through &quot;secondary&quot; distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.
The transition from transmission to distribution happens in a power substation, which has the following functions:
* Circuit breakers and switches enable the substation to be disconnected from the transmission grid or for distribution lines to be disconnected.
* Transformers step down transmission voltages, or more, down to primary distribution voltages. These are medium voltage circuits, usually .
* From the transformer, power goes to the busbar that can split the distribution power off in multiple directions. The bus distributes power to distribution lines, which fan out to customers.
Urban distribution is mainly underground, sometimes in common utility ducts. Rural distribution is mostly above ground with utility poles, and suburban distribution is a mix.
Closer to the customer, a distribution transformer steps the primary distribution power down to a low-voltage secondary circuit, usually 120/240 V in the US for residential customers. The power comes to the customer via a service drop and an electricity meter. The final circuit in an urban system may be less than but may be over for a rural customer.

==History==

Electric power distribution become necessary only in the 1880s, when electricity started being generated at power stations. Until then, electricity was usually generated where it was used. The first power-distribution systems installed in European and US cities were used to supply lighting: arc lighting running on very-high-voltage (around 3,000 V) alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC), and incandescent lighting running on low-voltage (100 V) direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large-area and street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas lights for business and residential users.

The high voltages used in arc lighting allowed a single generating station to supply a string of lights up to long. And each doubling of voltage would allow a given cable to transmit the same amount of power four times the distance than at the lower voltage (with the same power loss). By contrast, direct-current indoor incandescent lighting systems, such as Edison&#x27;s first power station, installed in 1882, had difficulty supplying customers more than a mile away because they used a low voltage (110 V) from generation to end use. The low voltage translated to higher current and required thick copper cables for transmission. In practice, Edison&#x27;s DC generating plants needed to be within about of the farthest customer to avoid even thicker and more expensive conductors.

=== Introduction of the transformer ===
The problem of transmitting electricity over longer distances became a recognized engineering roadblock to electric power distribution, with many less-than-satisfactory solutions tested by lighting companies. But the mid-1880s saw a breakthrough with the development of functional transformers that allowed AC power to be &quot;stepped up&quot; to a much higher voltage for transmission, then dropped down to a lower voltage near the end user. Compared to direct current, AC had much cheaper transmission costs and greater economies of scale — with large AC generating plants capable of supplying whole cities and regions, which led to the use of AC spreading rapidly.

In the US the competition between direct current and alternating current took a personal turn in the late 1880s in the form of a &quot;war of currents&quot; when Thomas Edison started attacking George Westinghouse and his development of the first US AC transformer systems, highlighting the deaths caused by high-voltage AC systems over the years and claiming any AC system was inherently dangerous. Edison&#x27;s propaganda campaign was short-lived, with his company switching over to AC in 1892.

AC became the dominant form of transmission of power with innovations in Europe and the US in electric motor designs, and the development of engineered &quot;universal systems&quot; allowing the large number of legacy systems to be connected to large AC grids.

In the first half of the 20th century, in many places the electric power industry was vertically integrated, meaning that one company did generation, transmission, distribution, metering and billing. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, nations began the process of deregulation and privatization, leading to electricity markets. The distribution system would remain regulated, but generation, retail, and sometimes transmission systems were transformed into competitive markets.

==Generation and transmission==

Electric power begins at a generating station, where the potential difference can be as high as 33,000 volts. AC is usually used. Users of large amounts of DC power such as some railway electrification systems, telephone exchanges and industrial processes such as aluminium smelting use rectifiers to derive DC from the public AC supply, or may have their own generation systems. High-voltage DC can be advantageous for isolating alternating-current systems or controlling the quantity of electricity transmitted. For example, Hydro-Québec has a direct-current line which goes from the James Bay region to Boston.

From the generating station it goes to the generating station&#x27;s switchyard where a step-up transformer increases the voltage to a level suitable for transmission, from 44 kV to 765 kV. Once in the transmission system, electricity from each generating station is combined with electricity produced elsewhere. For alternating-current generators, all generating units connected to a common network must be synchronized, operating at the same frequency within a small tolerance. Alternatively, disparate sources can be combined to serve a common load if some external power converter, such as a rotating machine or a direct current converter system is interposed. Electricity is consumed as soon as it is produced. It is transmitted at a very high speed, close to the speed of light.

== Primary distribution ==
Primary distribution voltages range from 4 kV to 35 kV phase-to-phase (2.4 kV to 20 kV phase-to-neutral) Only large consumers are fed directly from distribution voltages; most utility customers are connected to a transformer, which reduces the distribution voltage to the low voltage &quot;utilization voltage&quot;, &quot;supply voltage&quot; or &quot;mains voltage&quot; used by lighting and interior wiring systems.

=== Network configurations ===
Distribution networks are divided into two types, radial or network. A radial system is arranged like a tree where each customer has one source of supply. A network system has multiple sources of supply operating in parallel. Spot networks are used for concentrated loads. Radial systems are commonly used in rural or suburban areas.

Radial systems usually include emergency connections where the system can be reconfigured in case of problems, such as a fault or planned maintenance. This can be done by opening and closing switches to isolate a certain section from the grid.

Long feeders experience voltage drop (power factor distortion) requiring capacitors or voltage regulators to be installed.

Reconfiguration, by exchanging the functional links between the elements of the system, represents one of the most important measures which can improve the operational performance of a distribution system. The problem of optimization through the reconfiguration of a power distribution system, in terms of its definition, is a historical single objective problem with constraints. Since 1975, when Merlin and Back introduced the idea of distribution system reconfiguration for active power loss reduction, until nowadays, a lot of researchers have proposed diverse methods and algorithms to solve the reconfiguration problem as a single objective problem. Some authors have proposed Pareto optimality based approaches (including active power losses and reliability indices as objectives). For this purpose, different artificial intelligence based methods have been used: microgenetic, branch exchange, particle swarm optimization and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.

=== Rural services ===

Rural electrification systems tend to use higher distribution voltages because of the longer distances covered by distribution lines (see Rural Electrification Administration). 7.2, 12.47, 25, and 34.5 kV distribution is common in the United States; 11 kV and 33 kV are common in the UK, Australia and New Zealand; 11 kV and 22 kV are common in South Africa; 10, 20 and 35 kV are common in China. Other voltages are occasionally used.

Rural services normally try to minimize the number of poles and wires. It uses higher voltages (than urban distribution), which in turn permits use of galvanized steel wire. The strong steel wire allows for less expensive wide pole spacing. In rural areas a pole-mount transformer may serve only one customer. In New Zealand, Australia, Saskatchewan, Canada, and South Africa, Single-wire earth return systems (SWER) are used to electrify remote rural areas.

Three phase service provides power for large agricultural facilities, petroleum pumping facilities, water plants, or other customers that have large loads (three-phase equipment).
In North America, overhead distribution systems may be three phase, four wire, with a neutral conductor. Rural distribution system may have long runs of one phase conductor and a neutral.
In other countries or in extreme rural areas the neutral wire is connected to the ground to use that as a return (single-wire earth return).

== Secondary distribution ==

Electricity is delivered at a frequency of either 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the region. It is delivered to domestic customers as single-phase electric power. In some countries as in Europe a three phase supply may be made available for larger properties. Seen with an oscilloscope, the domestic power supply in North America would look like a sine wave, oscillating between −170 volts and 170 volts, giving an effective voltage of 120 volts RMS. Three-phase electric power is more efficient in terms of power delivered per cable used, and is more suited to running large electric motors. Some large European appliances may be powered by three-phase power, such as electric stoves and clothes dryers.

A ground connection is normally provided for the customer&#x27;s system as well as for the equipment owned by the utility. The purpose of connecting the customer&#x27;s system to ground is to limit the voltage that may develop if high voltage conductors fall down onto lower-voltage conductors which are usually mounted lower to the ground, or if a failure occurs within a distribution transformer. Earthing systems can be TT, TN-S, TN-C-S or TN-C.

=== Regional variations ===

====220–240 volt systems====
Most of the world uses 50 Hz 220 or 230 V single phase, or 400 V three-phase for residential and light industrial services. In this system, the primary distribution network supplies a few substations per area, and the 230 V / 400 V power from each substation is directly distributed to end users over a region of normally less than 1 km radius. Three live (hot) wires and the neutral are connected to the building for a three phase service. Single-phase distribution, with one live wire and the neutral is used domestically where total loads are light. In Europe, electricity is normally distributed for industry and domestic use by the three-phase, four wire system. This gives a phase-to-phase voltage of wye service and a single-phase voltage of between any one phase and neutral. In the UK a typical urban or suburban low-voltage substation would normally be rated between 150 kVA and 1 MVA and supply a whole neighbourhood of a few hundred houses. Transformers are typically sized on an average load of 1 to 2 kW per household, and the service fuses and cable is sized to allow any one property to draw a peak load of perhaps ten times this.
For industrial customers, 3-phase is also available, or may be generated locally. 
Large industrial customers have their own transformer(s) with an input from 11 kV to 220 kV.

==== 100–120 volt systems ====
Most of the Americas use 60 Hz AC, the 120/240 volt split-phase system domestically and three phase for larger installations. North American transformers usually power homes at 240 volts, similar to Europe&#x27;s 230 volts. It is the split-phase that allows use of 120 volts in the home.

In the electricity sector in Japan, the standard voltage is 100 V, with both 50 and 60 Hz AC frequencies being used. Parts of the country use 50 Hz, while other parts use 60 Hz. This is a relic from the 1890s. Some local providers in Tokyo imported 50 Hz German equipment, while the local power providers in Osaka brought in 60 Hz generators from the United States. The grids grew until eventually the entire country was wired. Today the frequency is 50 Hz in Eastern Japan (including Tokyo, Yokohama, Tohoku, and Hokkaido) and 60 Hz in Western Japan (including Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Shikoku, and Kyushu).

Most household appliances are made to work on either frequency. The problem of incompatibility came into the public eye when the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami knocked out about a third of the east&#x27;s capacity, and power in the west could not be fully shared with the east since the country does not have a common frequency.

There are four high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter stations that move power across Japan&#x27;s AC frequency border. Shin Shinano is a back-to-back HVDC facility in Japan which forms one of four frequency changer stations that link Japan&#x27;s western and eastern power grids. The other three are at Higashi-Shimizu, Minami-Fukumitsu and Sakuma Dam. Together they can move up to 1.2 GW of power east or west.

==== 240 volt systems and 120 volt outlets ====
Most modern North American homes are wired to receive 240 volts from the transformer, and through the use of split-phase electrical power, can have both 120 volt receptacles and 240 volt receptacles. The 120 volts is typically used for lighting and most wall outlets. The 240 volt circuits are typically used for appliances requiring high watt heat output such as ovens and heaters. They may also be used to supply an electric car charger.

== Modern distribution systems ==
Traditionally, the distribution systems would only operate as simple distribution lines where the electricity from the transmission networks would be shared among the customers. Today&#x27;s distribution systems are heavily integrated with renewable energy generations at the distribution level of the power systems by the means of distributed generation resources, such as solar energy and wind energy. As a result, distribution systems are becoming more independent from the transmission networks day-by-day. Balancing the supply-demand relationship at these modern distribution networks (sometimes referred to as microgrids) is extremely challenging, and it requires the use of various technological and operational means to operate. Such tools include battery storage power station, data analytics, optimization tools, etc.

Located south of Woodlawn Heights, Bronx, New York City, it has the character of a rural cemetery. Woodlawn Cemetery opened during the Civil War in 1863, in what was then Yonkers, in an area that was annexed to New York City in 1874. It is notable in part as the final resting place of some well-known figures. 
==Locale and grounds==

The Cemetery covers more than and is the resting place for more than 300,000 people. Built on rolling hills, its tree-lined roads lead to some unique memorials, some designed by famous American architects: McKim, Mead &amp; White, John Russell Pope, James Gamble Rogers, Cass Gilbert, Carrère and Hastings, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Beatrix Jones Farrand, and John La Farge. The cemetery contains seven Commonwealth war graves – six British and Canadian servicemen of World War I and an airman of the Royal Canadian Air Force of World War II. In 2011, Woodlawn Cemetery was designated a National Historic Landmark, since it shows the transition from the rural cemetery popular at the time of its establishment to the more orderly 20th-century cemetery style.

As of 2007, plot prices at Woodlawn were reported as $200 per square foot, $4,800 for a gravesite for two, and up to $1.5 million for land to build a family mausoleum.
==Burials moved to Woodlawn==
Woodlawn was the destination for many human remains disinterred from cemeteries in more densely populated parts of New York City:
* Rutgers Street church graves were moved to Woodlawn. Most graves were re-interred with a stated date of December 20, 1866 into the Rutgers Plot, lots 147–170.
* West Farms Dutch Reformed Church, at Boone Avenue and 172nd Street in The Bronx, had most of its graves moved to Woodlawn Cemetery in 1867 and interred in the Rutgers Plot, Lots 214–221.
* Bensonia Cemetery, also known as &quot;Morrisania Cemetery&quot;, was originally a Native American burial ground. The graves were moved to Woodlawn Cemetery with a stated date of April 21, 1871 and re-interred into Lot 3. Public School #138, in The Bronx, is now on the site.
* Harlem Church Yard cemetery internees were moved to Woodlawn. Most graves were re-interred with a stated date of August 1, 1871 into the Sycamore Plot, lots 1061–1080.
* Nagle Cemetery remains were moved in November–December 1926 and reinterred in Primrose Plot, Lot 16150. Identities of those interred are apparently unknown.
* The Dyckman-Nagle Burying Ground, West 212th Street at 9th Avenue, in the Borough of Manhattan, was originally established in 1677 and originally contained 417 plots. In 1905, the remains, with the exception of Staats Morris Dyckman and his family, were removed. By 1927, the Dyckman graves were finally moved to Woodlawn Cemetery. The former Dutch colonial-era cemetery is now a 207th Street subway train yard.

The fictional cemetery of the Synagogue in Brooklyn in the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; is actually located here, renamed &quot;Riverdale Cemetery&quot;.
==Notable burials==

Numerous notable persons have been interred at Woodlawn Cemetery including: Chief Justice of the United States Charles Evans Hughes; influential New York urban planner and builder Robert Moses; actress Cicely Tyson; Olympic champion swimmer Gertrude Ederle; aviation pioneer Harriet Quimby; performer, playwright and producer George M. Cohan; gangster Bumpy Johnson; authors Nellie Bly, Countee Cullen, Clarence Day, Damon Runyon, E.L. Doctorow, Herman Melville, and Dorothy Parker; musicians Irving Berlin, Miles Davis, Felix Pappalardi, Duke Ellington, W. C. Handy, Fritz Kreisler, Pigmeat Markham, King Oliver, and Max Roach; singers Celia Cruz and Florence Mills; Film director Otto Preminger; husband and wife magicians Alexander Herrmann and Adelaide Herrmann; sportswriter Grantland Rice; gunfighter and US marshal Bat Masterson; developer of the Rolfing body therapy and noted female biochemist Ida Rolf; and, businessmen such as shipping magnate Archibald Gracie, cosmetics manufacturer Richard Hudnut, America&#x27;s first self-made millionaire woman Madam C. J. Walker, department store founder Rowland Hussey Macy, and variety store mogul F. W. Woolworth. A large number of New York brewers (e.g., the Haffens of Haffen Brewing Company) are interred there on &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Row&quot;, along with a dozen other brewing scions and their families.

==Conservancy==
The Woodlawn Conservancy is a 501(c)(3) associated with Woodlawn Cemetery. It began as the Friends of Woodlawn in 1999. It enhances the mission of Woodlawn through fundraising, educational opportunities and outreach with other non-profits. In 2021, over 40 stones were conserved in a joint effort between the Woodlawn Conservancy, the Friends of the Rye African-American Cemetery, World Monuments Fund, and the Jay Heritage Center. The preservation effort was launched to coincide with the new federal Juneteenth celebration.

<doc id="212265" wikidata="Q2996045" url="?curid=212265" title="Alice in Wonderland (1985 film)">
<text>Alice in Wonderland is a 1985 American two-part made-for-television adventure family fantasy musical film of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s books &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871). An Irwin Allen production, it used a huge all-star cast of notable actors and actresses. The title role was played by Natalie Gregory, who wore a blonde wig for this miniseries. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was first telecast December 9, 1985, (part one) and December 10, 1985 (part two), at 8:00pm EST on CBS.

It was filmed in Los Angeles at the MGM Studios (now known as Sony Pictures Studios) in Culver City over a 55-day period from March 12, 1985, to May 28 of that same year. Additional filming took place at Malibu Beach for the oysters scene, and establishing shots of Alice&#x27;s house took place at the S. S. Hinds Estate, also in the Los Angeles area.

==Plot==
===Part 1 – &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;===
After helping her mother set the table for tea time, Alice goes outside to see her sister and play with her kitten, Dinah. The White Rabbit comes running by, saying he&#x27;s late. Wondering where he is going, Alice follows him and tumbles into his hole.

Alice finds herself in a hall with many doors, all of them locked. On a table is a key which she can use to open one small door. A small bottle appears labeled &quot;Drink Me.&quot; By drinking from the bottle, she shrinks to the right size for the door, but can no longer reach the key to open it. She then eats a little cake, which makes her grow to over nine feet tall. Frustrated, Alice begins to cry. The White Rabbit appears, but frightened of the giant Alice, runs away, dropping his fan and gloves. Using the fan makes Alice shrink again, which takes her diving in her pool of tears, where she meets The Lory Bird, The Dodo Bird and the Mouse, who tells her why he hates dogs and cats (&quot;I Hate Dogs and Cats&quot;).

The White Rabbit mistakes Alice for his housemaid Mary Ann and orders her to go get his fan and gloves from his house. While searching his house, Alice finds another &quot;Drink Me&quot; bottle, which makes her grow to nine feet tall once again. Angry at Alice, the rabbit and his butler Pat the Guinea Pig begin throwing berries at her, which turn into little cakes. She eats one and shrinks to back to size. After running away, she meets the Caterpillar who tells her the story &quot;You are Old, Father William&quot;. She then meets The Duchess and her cook; the Cheshire Cat, who tells her &quot;There&#x27;s No Way Home&quot;; and the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse having an outdoor tea party (&quot;Laugh&quot;). Alice runs off back on her quest for the White Rabbit, and meets a baby fawn in the forest, the only normal thing she&#x27;s seen so far (&quot;Why Do People Act as If They&#x27;re Crazy?&quot;).

Alice stumbles upon a doorway that leads to the rose garden of the Queen of Hearts, who always yells &quot;Off with her Head!&quot; She leaves to visit the Gryphon and Mock Turtle (&quot;Nonsense&quot;), but then she is called to attend the trial of the Knave of Hearts, who is accused of having stolen The Queen&#x27;s tarts. Alice stands up to the Queen and is forced to flee the court. She trips and falls and finds herself back home.

Alice runs inside, only to discover herself trapped on the other side of the mirror. She notices a large book next to her and starts reading a poem called &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; about a scary monster, a dragon called the Jabberwock. The lights go out, and the Jabberwock appears in the house.

===Part 2 – &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;===
The Jabberwock disappears as Alice hides behind the chessboard, knocking it over. As she places the pieces back on the table, she realizes they are all alive, but can&#x27;t hear her. Desperate for a clue, Alice looks around the room and sees a painting of an Owl, which comes to life and explains that the Jabberwock is a creation of Alice&#x27;s own childish fears, which she must overcome in order with the courage to return to the real world.

Alice has an interesting conversation with some talking flowers and meets The Red Queen from the chess set, now human-sized. The Red Queen tells Alice that she is now a pawn in a giant game of chess. Once Alice reaches the eighth square to become a queen, she can go home. She boards a train to the fourth square, where she meets the gnat and then Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who teach her the proper way to &quot;Shake Hands&quot; and sing the story of &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;. She meets The White Queen (&quot;Jam Tomorrow, Jam Yesterday&quot;) and Humpty Dumpty. The Jabberwock appears again and knocks Humpty Dumpty off of his wall.

Alice meets The White King and his messenger, who bring Alice to see &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn&quot; as they fight for the crown. The Lion and the Unicorn call a temporary truce and Alice hands out a tray of Looking-Glass Cake, which must be passed around first, then cut after. She is captured by the Red Knight and rescued by the White Knight, who sings and dances her all the way to the eighth square (&quot;We are Dancing&quot;). She meets up with the Red Queen and White Queen, who have a few &quot;Queenly&quot; tests (&quot;Can You do Addition&quot;) and some words of wisdom for her (&quot;Emotions&quot;). The White Queen falls asleep on Alice&#x27;s lap and the Red Queen sings her a lullaby (&quot;Hush-a-bye Lady&quot;). Alice finds her way to her castle, where a great feast has been set in her honor (&quot;To the Looking-Glass World&quot;).

A present is brought to her, out of which comes The Jabberwock. The Owl tells her to act brave. Alice finds her way back to the mirror and into her home, where she confronts The Jabberwock, telling him that he is just in her imagination and that she does not believe in him. In a billow of smoke and lightning, the Jabberwock disappears. Alice slumps into a chair and is woken up by her Mother calling Alice to tea. When Alice heads upstairs to change for tea, she sees her Wonderland family in the mirror, and they bid farewell to her (&quot;Alice&quot;).

==Ratings==
The miniseries was a modest success during its original airing. Out of 71 shows, part 1 ranked at 13, and came in at 21.2 points out of a 31-point share. Part 2 ranked at 35, and came in at 16.8 points out of a 25-point share. In total, the miniseries averaged 19 points out of a 28-point share. Part 1 won easily from 8-9 P.M. opposite &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; on ABC, and &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers and Practical Jokes&quot; on NBC. From 9–9:30 p.m., part 1 was 0.6 points ahead of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on ABC.

==In popular culture==
The Jabberwocky and the White Knight suits went on to be reused as &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; and &quot;Sir Giles the Knight&quot; in the 1986 musical TV film adaptation of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, produced by Irwin Allen Productions, with Michael Sorich as the voice of the Dragon, and Lloyd Bridges as Sir Giles.

The costumes for the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the King of Hearts, the Rose, and the Gentleman in the Paper Suit were used in the Halloween party sequence for &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993 film).

==Home media==
Warner Home Video first released the film on VHS in 1986. A 1993 release split the parts for individual sale, edited to eliminate the original cliffhanger: Part One ended with an onscreen quote from the final chapter of the first novel as Alice ran happily towards her home; Part Two, released as &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;, began with the final minutes trimmed from the previous installment.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in August 2006, restoring the original TV broadcast edit.

<doc id="212270" wikidata="Q820122" url="?curid=212270" title="The Mountain">
<text>The Mountain () was a political group during the French Revolution. Its members, called the Montagnards (), sat on the highest benches in the National Convention. The term, first used during a session of the Legislative Assembly, came into general use in 1793. By the summer of 1793, that pair of opposed minority groups divided the National Convention. That year, the Montagnards were influential in what is commonly known as the Reign of Terror.

The Mountain was the left-leaning radical group and opposed the more right-leaning Girondins. Despite the fact that both groups of the Jacobin Club had virtually no difference with regard to the establishment of the French Republic, the aggressive military intentions of the rich merchant class-backed Girondins, such as conquering the Rhineland, Poland and the Netherlands with a goal of creating a protective ring of satellite republics in Great Britain, Spain, and Italy, and a potential war with Austria, enabled the Montagnards to take over the administrative power of the National Convention under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre who openly advocated for a more peaceful external policy and rather focusing on the issues within the newly-founded First French Republic. This sharp transition of power from Girondins to Montagnards was proceeded after Robespierre accused the former group of traitorous and counter-revolutionary activities as well as betraying the Republic, which resulted in the execution of fellow Revolutionists including considerably influential figures like Jacques Pierre Brissot, and later the former Montagnard Georges Jacques Danton.

The Mountain was composed mainly of members of the middle class but represented the constituencies of Paris. As such, the Mountain was sensitive to the motivations of the city and responded strongly to demands from the working-class sans-culottes. The Mountain operated on the belief that what was best for Paris would be best for all of France. Although they attempted some rural land reform, most of it was never enacted and they generally focused on the needs of the urban poor over that of rural France.

The Girondins were a moderate political faction created during the Legislative Assembly period. They were the political opponents of the more radical representatives within the Mountain. The Girondins had wanted to avoid the execution of Louis XVI and supported a constitution that would have allowed a popular vote to overturn legislation. The Mountain accused the Girondins of plotting against Paris because this caveat within the proposed constitution would have allowed rural areas of France to vote against legislation that benefits Paris, the main constituency of the Mountain; however, the real discord in the Convention occurred not between the Mountain and the Gironde but between the aggressive antics of the minority of the Mountain and the rest of the Convention.

The Mountain was not unified as a party and relied on leaders like Robespierre, Danton, and Jacques Hébert, who themselves came to represent different factions. Hébert, a journalist, gained a following as a radical patriot Montagnard (members who identified with him became known as the Hébertists) while Danton led a more moderate faction of the Mountain (followers came to be known as Dantonists). Regardless of the divisions, the nightly sessions of the Jacobin club, which met in the rue Saint-Honoré, can be considered to be a type of caucus for the Mountain. In June 1793, the Mountain successfully ousted most of the moderate Gironde members of the Convention with the assistance of radical sans-culottes.

Following their coup, the Mountain, led by Hérault de Séchelles, quickly began construction on a new constitution which was completed eight days later. The Committee of Public Safety reported the constitution to the Convention on 10 June and a final draft was adopted on 24 June. The process occurred quickly because as Robespierre, a prominent member of the Mountain, announced on 10 June the &quot;good citizens demanded a constitution&quot; and the &quot;Constitution will be the reply of patriotic deputies, for it is the work of the Mountain&quot;. This constitution was never actually enacted, and the French Constitution of 1793 was also delayed due to the situation in the war and the Thermidorian Reaction that purged much of the government, and was eventually abandoned.

==History==
===Origins===
It is difficult to pinpoint the conception of the Montagnard group because the lines which defined it were themselves quite nebulous early on. Originally, members of The Mountain were the men who sat in the highest rows of the Jacobin Clubs, loosely organized political debate clubs open to the public. Though members of the Montagnards were known for their commitment to radical political resolutions prior to 1793, the contours of political groups presented an ever-evolving reality that shifted in response to events. Would-be prominent Montagnard leaders like Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet and Jean Bon Saint-André were tempted by early Girondin proposals and soon many moderates—even anti-radicals—felt the need to push for radical endeavors in light of threats both within and without the country. It was only after the trial of Louis XVI in December 1792, which united the Montagnards on a position of regicide, that the ideals and power of the group fully consolidated.

===Rise and terror===
The rise of Montagnards corresponds to the fall of the Girondins. The Girondins hesitated on the correct course of action to take with Louis XVI after his attempt to flee France on 20 June 1791. Some of the Girondins believed they could use the king as figurehead. While the Girondins hesitated, the Montagnards took a united stand during the trial in December 1792–January 1793 and favored the king&#x27;s execution. On 24 February the Convention decreed the first albeit unsuccessful Levée en Masse, triggering uprisings in rural France as the Montagnards&#x27; influence waned in Marseille, Toulon, and Lyon. Riding on this victory, the Montagnards then sought to discredit the Girondins. They used tactics previously employed by the Girondins to denounce them as liars and enemies of the Revolution. They also formed a legislative committee in which Nicolas Hentz proposed a limitation of inheritances, gaining more support for the Montagnards. Girondin members were subsequently banned from the Jacobin club and excluded from the National Convention on 31 May2 June 1793.

===Policies of the Mountain===
Through attempted land redistribution policies, the Mountain showed some support for the rural poor. In August 1793, Montagnard member Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès drafted a piece of legislation which dealt with agricultural reform; in particular, he urged &quot;relief from rent following harvest loss, compensation for improvements and fixity of tenure&quot;. This was in part to combat restlessness of share-croppers in the southwest. This draft never made it into law, but the drastic reforms suggest the Mountain&#x27;s awareness of the need to please their base of support, both the rural and urban poor.
Other policies aimed at supporting the poor included price controls enacted by the Mountain in 1793. This law, called the General Maximum, was supported by a group of agitators within the Mountain known as the Enragés. It fixed prices and wages throughout France. At the same time, bread prices were rising as the commodity became scarce, and in an initiative spearheaded by Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, a law was enacted in July 1793 that forbade the hoarding of &quot;daily necessities&quot;. The hoarding of grain became a crime punishable by death.

Other economic policies enacted by the Mountain included an embargo on the export of French goods. As a result of this embargo, France was essentially unable to trade with foreign markets and the import of goods effectively ended. In theory, this protected French markets from foreign goods and required French people to support French goods. In addition to the embargo against foreign goods, Act 1651, passed by the Mountain in October 1793, further isolated France from the rest of Europe by forbidding any foreign vessels from trading along the French coast. The Mountain also enacted policies restricting and granting religious freedom. These policies varied but began with a ban on religion, allowing only for &quot;the worship of Reason&quot; in 1793 and progressing to religious freedom with the separation of Church and State in 1795.

===Decline and fall===
The fall and exclusion of the Montagnards from the National Convention began with the collapse of the Revolution&#x27;s radical phase and the death of Robespierre on 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794). While the Montagnards celebrated unity, there was growing heterogeneity within the group as the Committee of Public Safety extended themselves with their tight control over the military and their extreme opposition to corruption in the government. Their extension drew the ire of other revolutionary leaders and a number of plots coalesced on 9 Thermidor (Thermidorian Reaction) when collaborators with the more moderate group the Dantonists acted in response to fears that Robespierre planned to execute them.

The purge of Robespierre was strongly similar to previous measures employed by the Montagnards to expel factions, such as the Girondins. However, as Robespierre was widely considered the heart of the Montagnards, his death symbolized their collapse. Few desired to take on the name of Montagnards afterwards, leaving around only about 100 men. Finally, at the end of 1794 the Mountain largely devolved into a group called The Crest (), which lacked any real power.

==Factions and prominent members==
The Mountain was born in 1792, with the merger of two prominent left-wing clubs: the Jacobins and Cordeliers. The Jacobins were initially moderate republicans and the Cordeliers were radical populist. In late 1792, Danton and his supporters wanted a reconciliation with the Girondins, which caused a break with Robespierre. After the trial of Girondins in 1793, Danton became strongly moderate while Robespierre and his allies continued their more radical policies. The moderates of Danton were also rival to the followers of Jacques Hébert who wanted the persecution of all non-Montagnards and the dechristianisation of France. When the Robespierrist and unaligned Montagnards eliminated first the Hébertists (March 1794) and then the Dantonistes (April 1794), these groups held the most influence in The Mountain. This was until the Thermidorian Reaction, when several conspirators supported by The Plain instituted a coup d&#x27;état. They executed Robespierre and his supporters and split from The Mountain to form the Thermidorian Left. The Montagnards that survived were arrested, executed or deported. By 1795 the Mountain had effectively been obliterated.

<text>The third USS &quot;Astoria&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was laid down on 6 September 1941 at William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, as &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;. It was subsequently renamed to &quot;Astoria&quot; in honor of the heavy cruiser which was sunk on 9 August 1942 during the Battle of Savo Island. &quot;Astoria&quot; was launched on 6 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Robert Lucas (wife of the editor of the &quot;Astorian-Budget&quot;), and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 May 1944, Captain George Carroll Dyer in command.

==Design==
The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Astoria&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Astoria&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
===Construction and early service===
&quot;Astoria&quot; was laid down at the Cramp Shipbuilding shipyard in Philadelphia on 6 September 1941 and was launched on 6 March 1943. She was originally named &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;, but during construction, she was renamed &quot;Astoria&quot; for Astoria, Oregon, with the hull number CL-90. After completing fitting-out, she was commissioned for active service on 17 May 1944. The ship thereafter embarked on her shakedown cruise along the western Atlantic, as far south as Bermuda, which lasted from 6 June to 23 July. She then returned to Philadelphia for an overhaul before departing to join the Pacific Fleet on 19 September. She passed through the Panama Canal and arrived in San Diego, California, on 3 October. &quot;Astoria&quot; later moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard before sailing for Pearl Harbor on 25 October. She arrived five days later and remained there through 16 November.

=== World War II===

On 16 November, &quot;Astoria&quot; left Pearl Harbor to join Task Force 38, the fast carrier task force, which was at that time based in Ulithi in the western Caroline Islands. She stopped in Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands while en route and reached Ulithi on 25 November. After arriving, she was assigned to Task Group 38.2, one of the carrier battle groups that formed TF 38. At that time, the unit also included The aircraft carriers , , , , and , the fast battleships , , and , the light cruisers , , , and , and twenty destroyers. &quot;Astoria&quot; was assigned the role of anti-aircraft escort for the fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers. The American fleet sortied on 11 December to support the invasion of Mindoro; the carriers conducted a series of raids from 14 to 16 December before poor weather on the 17th grounded the aircraft. That night, Typhoon Cobra struck the fleet and inflicted significant damage to a number of ships, sinking three destroyers, though &quot;Astoria&quot; was not seriously damaged. The fleet searched for two days for survivors from the destroyers that sank before returning to Ulithi.

TF 38 sortied from Ulithi again on 30 December to cover the invasion of Luzon, striking Japanese positions on the islands from 6 to 9 January 1945. By this time, TG 38.2 had been reduced to &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, and &quot;Hornet&quot;, covered by &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Pasadena&quot;, &quot;San Juan&quot;, the cruiser , and fifteen destroyers. Late on the 9th, the fleet began the South China Sea raid to attack Japanese holdings in China and Southeast Asia. &quot;Astoria&quot; escorted the carriers over the next two weeks as they struck various targets in Japanese occupied China, including Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hainan, and Formosa, and French Indochina, including the naval base at Cam Ranh Bay. The fleet returned to Ulithi on 25 January.

By early February, command of the fast carrier task force had passed to 5th Fleet, and so the unit was re-numbered TF 58. At that time, &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;, and &quot;Pasadena&quot; were transferred to TG 58.3, which included &quot;Cabot&quot;, the carriers and , the battleships and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the large cruiser , and fourteen destroyers. The fleet, including &quot;Astoria&quot;, sortied early that month to conduct a series of air attacks on the Japanese home islands, which began on 18 February. Later that day, the fleet sailed south to support the invasion of Iwo Jima, and &quot;Astoria&quot; was detached to conduct shore bombardment on 21 February. She thereafter rejoined the carriers for another round of strikes on the Japanese capital, Tokyo, and thereafter returned to Ulithi on 3 March. TF 58 got underway again on 14 March to begin air strikes to prepare for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa. &quot;Astoria&quot; once again served in the anti-aircraft screen for the carriers of TG 58.3 during these operations. Over the course of the next three months of sustained combat, &quot;Astoria&quot;″s gunners claimed credit for eleven Japanese aircraft and partial credit for several others. &quot;Astoria&quot; returned to Leyte in the Philippines on 1 June for periodic maintenance that lasted for a month.

On 1 July, she sailed to return to the fast carrier task force for another major operation against the Japanese home islands. By that time, Third Fleet had resumed control of the force, so unit to which &quot;Astoria&quot; returned had reverted to the designation TG 38.3. During this period, she served in Cruiser Division 17, and she was twice detached to conduct patrols for Japanese vessels off Honshu. These were carried out on 17–18 and 24–25 July. For the first of these, &quot;Astoria&quot; joined &quot;Pasadena&quot;, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;, and their sister ship , along with six destroyers, to create Task Group 35.1. They were sent to carry out a sweep for Japanese vessels off northern Honshu and in the Kii Channel, but they failed to locate any targets. For the latter operation, &quot;Astoria&quot; was again detached to join the bombardment force TG 35.3 on 24 July, along with &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;, &quot;Pasadena&quot;, and &quot;Springfield&quot;. The ships shelled the seaplane base at Kushimoto that evening and later bombarded Cape Shionomisaki. TF 38&#x27;s operations off Japan continued through the end of July and into the first two weeks of August. On 15 August, Japan agreed to surrender and TF 38 ceased offensive operations, though the fleet continued to patrol off the coast of Japan. &quot;Astoria&quot; remained with the fleet until 3 September, when she received orders to return home. For her wartime service, &quot;Astoria&quot; received five battle stars.

===Post war===
&quot;Astoria&quot; reached San Pedro, California, on 15 September, anchoring there until she departed to return to Pearl Harbor on 24 November. Arriving there six days later, she took part in training exercises over the following days. She left to return to San Pedro on 10 December, arriving five days later. Over the course of the following ten months, the ship cruised along the western coast of North America, as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia, and as far south as San Diego. The ship got underway for a lengthy voyage to the central Pacific on 15 October 1946, which included stops in Guam and Saipan in the Marianas Islands. On 17 February 1947, she left Guam to return home by way of Kwajalein and Pearl Harbor, arriving in San Diego on 24 March. She resumed her peacetime cruises along the west coast through September 1948.

The ship departed for another overseas cruise on 1 October, this time headed to East Asian waters. She stopped in Pearl Harbor for three days while en route and then resumed her voyage across the Pacific, arriving in Qingdao, China, on 29 October. &quot;Astoria&quot; visited a number of ports in the area over the next three and a half months, including Inchon and Pusan in Korea, Sasebo and Yokosuka in Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ship left Yokosuka on 16 February 1949, bound for the United States. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way and arrived in San Francisco on 8 March. While there on 1 July, &quot;Astoria&quot; was decommissioned and assigned to the San Francisco Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 November 1969, when she was struck from the naval register. She was sold for scrap to the Nicolai Joffe Corp. on 12 January 1971 and subsequently broken up.

<text>The 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18 (7.5 cm le.IG 18) was an infantry support gun of the German Wehrmacht used during World War II.

== History ==
Development of the gun began in 1927, by Rheinmetall. The crew was protected by an armoured shield. There was a mountain gun variant, the 7.5 cm le.GebIG 18. For transport, the mountain variant could be broken down into six to ten packs, the heaviest weighing 74.9 kg. These were typically assigned at two to each mountain battalion. Six 7.5 cm le.IG 18F were manufactured in 1939. These were airborne guns, capable of being broken down into four 140 kg loads. The airborne variant had smaller wheels and no shield. There was also an infantry support gun, known as the 7.5 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/13 and designed as a replacement for the le.IG 18, which could be broken into four to six loads. However, though prototypes were tested, the German army felt that it did not improve on the existing design sufficiently to merit introduction and the army stayed with the earlier gun.

<text>Airborne guns are airborne artillery pieces, designed for use by paratroopers. They are generally specific or specialised types of infantry support guns, being in the traditional sense capable of being broken down into smaller loads for transport by aircraft and soldiers, thus also suitable as mountain guns. The historical concept of the &quot;airborne guns&quot; is to some degree outdated, their role being filled by mortars, wire-guided missiles, and/or light anti-tank weapons. As it has been many decades since two industrialized great powers engaged directly in warfare, the concept of the &quot;airborne gun&quot; allowing paratroopers to maintain an airhead against an armored force is in that sense non-functional, but currently, all three of the U.S. Army&#x27;s howitzers (for example), are air-mobile.
==Airborne guns by country==

=== China ===
*Chinese airborne forces have mounted 105mm recoilless rifles on jeeps but otherwise conform to the Warsaw Pact doctrine of light armored vehicles.

=== Germany (historical) ===
*7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18

=== Italy ===
*OTO Melara Mod 56 The Mod 56 was quite popular among mountain and airborne units, as it could be broken down into 12 components.

=== Soviet Union / Russia ===
*Soviet (and Russian) military doctrine calls for its airborne forces to be fully mechanized (via the BMD series) and hence its artillery to be self-propelled. Turretless AT gun carriers like the ASU-57 and ASU-85 equipped Warsaw Pact airborne forces as well. The older 2S9 Nona and the newer 2S25 Sprut-SD heavily resemble light tanks, and are armed with a 120 mm gun-howitzer-mortar and a 125 mm autoloaded tank gun, respectively. The BM-21V (no longer in service) was a lightened variant of the BM-21 Grad MLRS. Additionally, the VDV employs a range of more traditional towed guns, namely the 2B16 Nona non-self-propelled variant, the D-30 122 mm howitzer, and the ZU-23 23 mm twin AA autocannon.

=== Turkey ===

* MKE launched the 105 mm air transportable light towed howitzer (Boran) project to fulfill the operational requests of the Commando and Infantry units for Airborne Operations. The system can calculate its own position and identify targets without usual deployment procedures thanks to its modern command and fire control systems. It has a minimum range of and 6400 NATO mils (360°) firing capability. The howitzer weights around and can be airlifted with a medium-lift utility helicopter and deployed in a short time for fire missions. Based on L118.

=== United Kingdom ===
*Ordnance QF 6 pounder- antitank gun (~1960)

=== United States===
*M119 air mobile / air assault (slingload/parachute) is based on the UK L118 Light Gun, firing a 105mm shell that is useful against light vehicles and/or fixed emplacements but would be ineffective against a main battle tank
*the medium M198 can be dropped by parachute or transported by heavy-lift cargo helicopter, will be replaced by the even lighter titanium M777, firing 155 mm shells with significant anti-personnel capabilities. Can achieve anti-armor capability with specialised shells, e.g. SADARM

<doc id="212292" wikidata="Q322265" url="?curid=212292" title="Status Quo (band)">
<text>Status Quo are a British rock band. The group originated in London and was founded in 1962 by Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster while they were still schoolboys. After a number of name and lineup changes, which included the introduction of John Coghlan in 1963 and Rick Parfitt in 1967, the band became The Status Quo in 1967 and Status Quo in 1969. As of 2022, the group have been active for 60 consecutive years (despite announcing a breakup in 1984, they played Live Aid the following year and resumed normal activities in 1986).

They have had over 60 chart hits in the UK – more than any other band – including &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; (their first charting song), &quot;Caroline&quot; (their first top 5 hit), and &quot;Down Down&quot; (their only No. 1 hit). Twenty-two of these reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart, and fifty-seven reached the Top 40. They have released over 100 singles and 33 studio albums, most of which were bestsellers. Since reaching number 5 on the UK albums chart in 1972 with &quot;Piledriver&quot;, Status Quo have placed 29 consecutive studio albums on the UK charts, including 20 in the top ten studio albums, extending all the way up to their most recent release, &quot;Backbone&quot;, in 2019. In 2012, they were announced as the tenth best-selling group of all time on the UK Singles Chart with 7.2 million singles sales in their homeland alone. As of 2015, they were one of only 50 artists to have achieved more than 500 total weeks on the UK Albums Chart.

In July 1985 the band opened Live Aid at Wembley Stadium with &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;. In 1991, Status Quo received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2014, preparing to headline that year&#x27;s Download Festival, Status Quo won the &quot;Service to Rock&quot; award at the Kerrang! Awards. Status Quo appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; more than any other band. Their success and longevity as well, in part, as their connections to the British Royal Family, including philanthropic work with the Prince&#x27;s Trust, have seen them frequently described as a &quot;national institution&quot; by the media. The band claim to have sold over 118 million records worldwide.

==History==
===1962–1967: Formative years===
Status Quo were formed in 1962 under the name The Paladins by Francis Rossi (vocals, guitar) and Alan Lancaster (bass) at Sedgehill Comprehensive School, Catford, London, along with classmates Jess Jaworski (keyboards) and Alan Key (drums). Rossi and Lancaster played their first gig at the Samuel Jones Sports Club in Dulwich, London. In 1963, Key was replaced by John Coghlan and the band changed their name to The Spectres. After changing their name, Lancaster&#x27;s father arranged for the group to perform weekly at a venue called the Samuel Jones Sports Club, where they were noticed by Pat Barlow, a gasfitter and budding pop music manager. Barlow became the group&#x27;s manager and secured them spots at venues around London, such as El Partido in Lewisham and Café des Artistes in Chelsea. In 1965, when Rossi, Lancaster and Jaworski left school, Jaworski opted to leave the band and was replaced by Roy Lynes.

They began writing their own material, and later that year met Rick Parfitt who was playing with a cabaret band called The Highlights. By the end of 1965, Rossi and Parfitt – who had become close friends after meeting at Butlins – made a commitment to continue working together. On 18 July 1966, the Spectres signed a five-year deal with Piccadilly Records, releasing two singles that year, &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; (first recorded by Joe Sentieri and most famously covered by Tom Jones) and &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; (an original song by Alan Lancaster), and one the next year called &quot;(We Ain&#x27;t Got) Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot; (originally recorded by New York psychedelic band the Blues Magoos). All three singles failed to make an impact on the charts.

In 1967, the group&#x27;s sound began moving towards psychedelia and they renamed themselves Traffic, but were soon forced to change it to Traffic Jam to avoid confusion with Steve Winwood&#x27;s Traffic, following an argument over who had registered the name first. The band secured an appearance on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Club&quot;, but in June their next single, &quot;Almost But Not Quite There&quot; (an original song by Francis Rossi), underperformed. The following month saw Parfitt, at the request of manager Pat Barlow, joining the band as rhythm guitarist and vocalist. Shortly after Parfitt&#x27;s recruitment, in August 1967, the band officially became The Status Quo.

===1968–1971: Breakthrough and development of classic style===

In January 1968, the group released the psychedelic-flavoured &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;. The song hit the UK Singles Chart, reaching number seven; &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; became the group&#x27;s only Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although Status Quo&#x27;s albums have been released in the United States throughout their career, they never achieved the same level of success there as they have in Britain. Though the follow-up was the unsuccessful single &quot;Black Veils of Melancholy&quot;, they had a hit again the same year with a pop song penned by Marty Wilde and Ronnie Scott, &quot;Ice in the Sun&quot;, which climbed to number eight. All three singles were included on the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo&quot;, released in September 1968. After the breakthrough, the band management hired Bob Young as a roadie and tour manager. Over the years Young became one of the most important songwriting partners for Status Quo, in addition to occasionally playing harmonica with them on stage and on record.

After their second album, 1969&#x27;s &quot;Spare Parts&quot;, failed commercially, the band&#x27;s musical direction moved away from psychedelia towards a more hard rock/boogie rock sound. The change in sound also brought a change in image, away from Carnaby Street fashions to faded denims and T-shirts, an image which was to become their trademark throughout the 1970s. The new direction was displayed on the band&#x27;s third album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Ma Kelly&#x27;s Greasy Spoon&quot; and its preceding single &quot;Down the Dustpipe&quot;. Lynes left the band in 1970 with the remaining members continuing as a four-piece, although they were often joined in the studio by guest keyboard players including Jimmy Horowitz, Tom Parker and Andy Bown, the latter an ex-member of The Herd and Judas Jump and part of the Peter Frampton Band. In 1976, Bown also began playing live with the band and was eventually made an official member of Status Quo in 1981. The band&#x27;s first recording without Lynes was the late 1970 single &quot;In My Chair&quot;, followed by their fourth album &quot;Dog of Two Head&quot; in 1971.

===1972–1981: Signing to Vertigo and major success===

In 1972 the band left Pye Records and signed with the heavy rock and progressive label Vertigo Records. Their first album for Vertigo, &quot;Piledriver&quot;, was released in 1972, going Top 5 in the UK. &quot;Piledriver&quot; heralded an even heavier, self-produced sound. This album was essentially the stylistic template for their next four albums, &quot;Hello!&quot; (1973), &quot;Quo&quot; (1974), &quot;On the Level&quot; (1975) and &quot;Blue for You&quot; (1976). &quot;Hello!&quot; was the band&#x27;s first UK No. 1 album, while &quot;Quo&quot; reached No. 2 and &quot;On the Level&quot; and &quot;Blue for You&quot; both also reached No. 1. In 1976, they signed a pioneering sponsorship deal with Levi&#x27;s. The following year the group released a double &quot;Live!&quot; album, which reached No. 3 in the UK. 

Quo&#x27;s hit singles from this era, with peak UK chart position and year, include: &quot;Paper Plane&quot; (No. 8 in 1972), &quot;Caroline&quot; (No. 5 in 1973), &quot;Break The Rules&quot; (No. 8 in 1974), &quot;Down Down&quot; (No. 1 in 1975), &quot;Roll Over Lay Down&quot; (No. 10 in 1975), &quot;Rain&quot; (No. 7 in 1976), &quot;Mystery Song&quot; (No. 11 in 1976), &quot;Wild Side of Life&quot; (No. 9 in 1976), &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; (No. 3 in 1977), &quot;Again and Again&quot; (No. 13 in 1978), &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; (No. 4 in 1979), &quot;Living on an Island&quot; (No. 16 in 1979), &quot;What You&#x27;re Proposing&quot; (No. 2 in 1980), the double A-side &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Drive My Car&quot; (No. 11 in 1980), &quot;Somethin&#x27; &#x27;Bout You Baby I Like&quot; (No. 9 in 1981) and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (No. 8 in 1981). &quot;Down Down&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1975, becoming their only UK No. 1 single to date. 

From 1977 onwards, the band&#x27;s sound became more polished as they began to employ outside producers. Roger Glover of Deep Purple and Rainbow was the first outside producer to work with Quo since Pye&#x27;s John Schroeder in the early 1970s, and produced the non-album single &quot;Wild Side of Life&quot; and its B-side &quot;All Through The Night&quot; in 1976. The next three studio albums, &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; (1977), &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Stand the Heat...&quot; (1978) and &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; (1979), were produced by Pip Williams, while the band&#x27;s first two albums of the 1980s, &quot;Just Supposin&#x27;&quot; (1980) and &quot;Never Too Late&quot; (1981), were produced by John Eden. All five of these albums went Top 5 in the UK. The title track of &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;, a minor hit for its writer John Fogerty (formerly of Creedence Clearwater Revival), became one of Status Quo&#x27;s most enduring anthems. In 1980 the band released a No. 3 charting greatest hits album &quot;12 Gold Bars&quot;.

===1981–1990: Lineup changes, Live Aid and &quot;In The Army Now&quot;===
Tensions within the band saw Coghlan leaving late in 1981. His replacement was Pete Kircher from the 1960s pop band Honeybus. Andy Bown also became an official member of the band at this time. This line-up recorded three albums, &quot;1+9+8+2&quot;, &quot;Live at the N.E.C.&quot; and &quot;Back to Back&quot; in 1982 and 1983. Although contracted to record more albums, this line-up played its last full-length gig on 21 July 1984 at the Milton Keynes Bowl. &quot;Everybody was coked-up and hating each other&quot;, Rossi recalled, &quot;and I&#x27;d started drinking tequila on that tour. I don&#x27;t remember that show at all – the encores or anything; just falling flat on my back at one point.&quot; &quot;Deciding to retire from the road – all that was about was getting Francis a solo career,&quot; declared Lancaster. &quot;Nobody on the outside knew it, but he didn&#x27;t want to work with me or Rick anymore.&quot; In 1984, the band released a cover of &quot;The Wanderer&quot; by Dion as a single from &quot;12 Gold Bars Vol. 2&quot;, which reached No. 7 while the album reached No. 12.

Status Quo&#x27;s final appearance with the Kircher line-up opened the Live Aid charity event at Wembley Stadium in July 1985. That year, Rossi recorded and released two solo singles with long-time writing partner Bernie Frost. Parfitt recorded a solo album, &quot;Recorded Delivery&quot;, with bass player John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards and drummer Jeff Rich. The album remains unreleased, although some tracks were reworked and released sporadically as Quo B-sides until 1987.

In mid-1985, Rossi, Parfitt and Bown, with Edwards and Rich, started work on a new Quo album. Lancaster – by this time more or less settled in Australia – took out a legal injunction to stop the band using the Status Quo name, citing increasing musical differences, notably during sessions for &quot;Back to Back&quot;. The specific dispute concerned two tracks that became hits for the group around that time. Lancaster had co-written &quot;Ol&#x27; Rag Blues&quot;, but was angered when the producers chose to release a version with Rossi singing the lead vocal instead of one sung by himself. The injunction also prevented the release of a single, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, for which a catalogue number was issued by Vertigo.

An out-of-court settlement was made in January 1986, giving Rossi and Parfitt the rights to the band&#x27;s name, enabling the new Status Quo line-up to continue recording &quot;In The Army Now&quot;, for which &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; was reworked as &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. Lancaster remained in Australia, and in 1986 joined an Australian supergroup, The Party Boys, featuring Angry Anderson of Rose Tattoo, John Brewster of the Angels and Kevin Borich, but achieved little success outside Australia. Lancaster left Status Quo formally in 1987.

In 1986, Quo supported Queen on the latter&#x27;s Magic Tour. The commercially successful &quot;In the Army Now&quot; album was released later that year, peaking at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. Its title track became one of the band&#x27;s biggest UK singles, reaching No. 2. The following album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Complaining&quot;, in 1988, was less successful but produced the No. 5 hit &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;. Rerecorded (with new lyrics) in April 1994 with Manchester United F.C. as &quot;Come On You Reds&quot;, the single would have given the band their second UK No. 1, but it was credited as &#x27;by Manchester United&#x27;. The following album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Remedy&quot;, became their first since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Dog of Two Head&quot; not to go Top 20 in the UK. In 1990 the band scored their last UK Top 10 single with &quot;The Anniversary Waltz Part One&quot;, a medley of rock and roll classics to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Rossi and Parfitt&#x27;s first meeting. The track was recorded for a new greatest hits album &quot;Rocking All Over the Years&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK, while a follow-up medley &quot;The Anniversary Waltz Part Two&quot; appeared as a single at the end of the year.

===1991–2009: &quot;Rock &#x27;Til You Drop&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; and touring===
The early-to-mid-1990s saw falling album sales for the band. To promote the release of the &quot;Rock &#x27;til You Drop&quot; album (1991), Quo performed four arena gigs in Sheffield, Glasgow, Birmingham and London in the space of 12 hours, earning them a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. 1992 brought the band&#x27;s third live album, &quot;Live Alive Quo&quot;. The next studio album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Thirsty Work&quot;, included a cover of the Jennifer Warnes song &quot;I&#x27;m Restless&quot; revealing an alternative and lighter sound to the band. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; (1996), and &quot;Famous in the Last Century&quot; (2000) consisted almost entirely of cover versions, (with the only exception being the title track to the latter). The former brought some chart success for Quo with covers of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; and The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;. The band became involved in an acrimonious dispute with Radio 1 after the station refused to include the &quot;Fun Fun Fun&quot; single on the radio station&#x27;s playlist. In 1993, Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt attracted a crowd of over 25,000 when they performed the annual Blackpool Illuminations lights switch-on.

Parfitt underwent quadruple by-pass surgery in 1997, but was able to make a full recovery and returned with a performance at the Norwich City Football Club ground Carrow Road three months later. Status Quo also returned to Australia in 1997, completing their first tour there since 1978. A greatest hits album, &quot;Whatever You Want – The Very Best of Status Quo&quot; was also released, achieving silver sales in the UK that year. In 1999, Quo toured Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Dubbed the &#x27;Last Night of the Proms&#x27;, the band were backed by a full orchestra during the concerts. That same year also saw the release of the album &quot;Under the Influence&quot;.

Rich left in 2000 and was replaced by Matt Letley. Andrew Bown also took a year off at the same time following the death of his wife, and was temporarily replaced on stage by Paul Hirsh, formerly of Voyager. In November 2000, the band played a gig at Grandchester in the outback in Australia, performing on a carriage of Australia&#x27;s Orient Express, the Great South Pacific Express.

Between 2002 and 2005, Quo released the albums &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, &quot;Riffs&quot; and &quot;The Party Ain&#x27;t Over Yet&quot;. Another greatest hits album, &quot;XS All Areas – The Greatest Hits&quot;, appeared in 2004 with two new songs, &quot;You&#x27;ll Come &#x27;Round&quot; and &quot;Thinking of You&quot;. In 2005 Rossi and Parfitt made cameo appearances in the long-running ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in a storyline which involved them being sued by the notorious layabout Les Battersby, and performing live at his wedding as compensation.

In December 2005, it was announced that Parfitt had been taken ill and was undergoing tests for throat cancer. All subsequent dates of the UK tour were cancelled as a result. However, the growths in Parfitt&#x27;s throat were later found to be benign and were successfully removed. In May 2006, a fully recovered Parfitt and the band returned to the NEC Birmingham to play the show that they had postponed in December. This was their 40th show at the venue, and was filmed for a DVD, entitled &quot;Just Doin&#x27; It&quot;.
On 1 July 2007, they performed in front of 63,000 people at the newly built Wembley Stadium as part of the &quot;Concert for Diana&quot;. They also appeared on the TV programme Tiswas Reunited, in which the band got the usual greeting of custard pies and buckets of water whilst playing the song, &quot;Gerdundula&quot;. On 15 September 2007, Rossi and Parfitt appeared on ITV programme &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&quot; and won £50,000 for their 2 charities Ebbisham Association and Nordoff Robbins.

Their twenty-eighth studio album, &quot;In Search of the Fourth Chord&quot;, was released on the band&#x27;s own Fourth Chord label in September 2007 in the UK, and on Edel Records in the rest of Europe. The title is a self-satirical response to the frequent criticism that they are a three-chord band. Produced by veteran producer Pip Williams, who had worked with Quo in the studio since 1977, the album was only moderately successful.

In 2008, they teamed up with German techno group Scooter to record a jumpstyle version of their 1979 single &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; entitled &quot;Jump That Rock (Whatever You Want)&quot;. In December 2008, they released their 75th single and first Christmas single, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas Time&quot;, which peaked at No. 40 in the UK Singles Chart. The track was from the new &quot;Pictures – 40 Years of Hits&quot; greatest hits album. The following year a live album and DVD, &quot;Pictures – Live at Montreux&quot;, was released.

===2010–2013: &quot;Hello Quo&quot;, &quot;Frantic Four&quot; reunion tours and &quot;Bula Quo!&quot;===
Rossi and Parfitt were each awarded the OBE in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to music and their long-standing charity work, including for The Prince&#x27;s Trust, British Heart Foundation and Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine reported on 17 March 2010 that the band had patched up their relationship with Lancaster, and were discussing the possibility of a future collaboration. The article stated &quot;While the band are back on friendly terms with Alan, it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll see any future reunion, with Quo continuing as normal and Lancaster busy with charity events and overseeing the activities of his son&#x27;s band The Presence&quot;.

On 20 September 2010, Status Quo was honoured with a PRS for Music plaque commemorating their first gig at the Welcome Inn in Well Hall Road, Eltham, where the band first performed in 1967. Later that month, on 26 September, a new version of &quot;In the Army Now&quot;, titled &quot;In the Army Now (2010)&quot;, was released through Universal / UMC as a single and as part of a new compilation album, also titled &quot;In the Army Now (2010)&quot;, with all profits from the single and album donated equally to the British Forces Foundation and Help for Heroes charities. &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;, a box set of sessions, live concerts and TV appearances at the BBC was released on 24 October 2010. The set was released in various formats: a full 7CD and 1DVD version covering almost all appearances, while the 2CD and 4CD versions present some highlights; the DVD was also released individually. 

Their twenty-ninth studio album, &quot;Quid Pro Quo&quot;, was released in a deluxe format exclusively at Tesco on 30 May 2011. The regular edition was released elsewhere on 6 June. The album peaked at No. 10 on the UK chart. December 2011 saw Status Quo undertake their first all-arenas UK winter tour. Quo also performed for the first time at The O2 in London. The tour was dubbed &quot;Quofest&quot; and featured Roy Wood and Kim Wilde as support for all shows, and joining the band during the encore.

The band&#x27;s first cinematic documentary, &quot;Hello Quo!&quot;, was filmed in 2011 with director Alan G. Parker; it screened in cinemas on 22 October 2012, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD the following week. The movie included contributions from Brian May, Jeff Lynne, Cliff Richard, Joe Elliott, Paul Weller, Joe Brown, Jim Lea, Andy Scott and Steve Diggle.
In April 2012, Status Quo announced they were shooting their first feature film, over several weeks in Fiji. A 90-minute action comedy, entitled &quot;Bula Quo!&quot;, taking its name from the islanders&#x27; traditional Fijian greeting, and also referencing the title of the band&#x27;s best-selling album, &quot;Hello!&quot; featuring the band as themselves, and also starring Jon Lovitz, Craig Fairbrass and Laura Aikman. The film was directed by Stuart St. Paul, produced by Tim Major and was released in cinemas on 5 July 2013. The film was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name, the band&#x27;s 30th studio album, released on 10 June. It featured nine new songs and ten re-records and live tracks. &quot;Bula Quo!&quot; debuted in the UK chart at number 10.

On 9 July 2012, the band released the single &quot;The Winner&quot; for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In July 2012 Coles, an Australian national supermarket chain, signed Status Quo to record a version of &quot;Down Down&quot; using Coles&#x27; tag line &#x27;Down, down, prices are down&#x27;. In September 2012, the band performed at Hyde Park for BBC Radio 2 &quot;Live in Hyde Park&quot;. In November 2012, Coles continued their association with Status Quo, producing a series of television adverts with the band appearing and performing &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas Time&quot;. In 2013, new adverts were released by Coles with Quo using &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; as the new jingle.

In December that year, Quo toured under the Quofest banner for a second year, this time supported by Bonnie Tyler and Eddie and the Hot Rods. In December 2012, Letley announced his decision to leave the band after 12 years, and subsequently departed following completion of their 2012 winter tour. However, Letley toured with Quo their Australia and Mexico tour in March and April 2013, due to limited time to find a new drummer after the Frantic Four Tour.

The 1970–81 line-up (Rossi, Parfitt, Lancaster and Coghlan) reunited as &quot;The Frantic Four&quot; in March 2013 for a series of dates in Manchester, Wolverhampton, Glasgow and London. Three live albums were issued from the tour, covering the O2 Academy in Glasgow (9 and 10 March 2013), the Hammersmith Apollo (15 and 16 March 2013) and the last date of the tour at Wembley Arena (17 March 2013), with the Wembley show also being filmed for a DVD.

In May 2013, Leon Cave became Quo&#x27;s new drummer. In the latter months of 2013, Status Quo embarked on their Bula Quo tour, supported by Uriah Heep on German dates, and by 10cc in the UK. This was followed by nine concert dates in the UK during 2014. On 25 November 2013, it was announced that Status Quo would headline the second stage at the Download Festival in June 2014.

===2014–present: &quot;Aquostic&quot;, Parfitt&#x27;s death and &quot;Backbone&quot;===
In January 2014, Wychwood Brewery announced they would be releasing a Status Quo brand of beer, named after their 1972 album &quot;Piledriver&quot;, exclusively in JD Wetherspoon pubs across the UK in February, before going on general sale in April. March 2014 saw the second &#x27;Frantic Four&#x27; reunion tour featuring Rossi and Parfitt with original members Lancaster and Coghlan with their last gig being at The O2 in Dublin, which was recorded and filmed for album and DVD release, both titled &quot;The Frantic Four&#x27;s Final Fling&quot;. Rossi indicated that this would be the last reunion tour of the &#x27;Frantic Four&#x27; line-up. On 8 March 2014, Rossi and Parfitt appeared on ITV show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; performing &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; with McBusted.
In August 2014, it was reported that founding keyboardist Jess Jaworski had died. In October 2014, Parfitt and Rossi appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, performing an acoustic version of &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;. In May 2015, the twosome appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, to talk about their &quot;Aquostic – Stripped Bare&quot; album. On 9 May 2015, they performed &quot;In the Army Now&quot; at the VE Day 70: A Party to Remember.

On 22 October 2014, the band launched the &quot;Aquostic&quot; album with a 90-minute performance at London&#x27;s Roundhouse, with the concert recorded and broadcast live by BBC Radio 2 as part of their &quot;In Concert&quot; series. Footage from the concert was later used, interspersed with interviews with Rossi and Parfitt, in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Status Quo: Live and Acoustic&quot;, in January 2017. A live album and DVD of the concert, both titled &quot;Aquostic – Live at the Roundhouse&quot;, were issued in 2015. On 5 June 2015, Status Quo were the headline act at Palmerston Park in Dumfries, at the stadium of Queen of the South and were supported by Reef and Big Country, in the first ever live concert at the venue.
On 1 February 2016, it was announced that Status Quo, in addition to the spring and summer dates already scheduled, would tour Europe starting in October. The final dates would take place in the UK towards the end of the year, after which the group would retire from playing &#x27;electric&#x27; tours. The &#x27;Last of The Electrics&#x27; tour was subsequently extended into 2017, with additional concerts outside the UK. The band performed in Aquostic line-up at BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Live in Hyde Park&quot;, in September 2016. Their next album &quot;Aquostic II – That&#x27;s a Fact!&quot; was released on 21 October that year.

On 28 October 2016, Parfitt permanently retired from live performances after suffering a heart attack earlier the same year. On 24 December, he died in hospital in Marbella, Spain as a result of severe infection, after suffering an injury to his shoulder. Parfitt&#x27;s funeral was held at Woking Crematorium on 19 January 2017. Irish guitarist Richie Malone, who had substituted for Parfitt during some 2016 live shows, took his place in the group on rhythm guitar, playing on both recorded material and at live shows. The band had to postpone a concert in June 2017 after frontman Rossi became ill.

2017 and 2018 saw the releases of three new live albums, &quot;The Last Night of the Electrics&quot;, &quot;Down Down and Dirty at Wacken&quot; and &quot;Down Down and Dignified at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, with the former two also having companion DVD releases. In June 2019, Status Quo were the special guests for Lynyrd Skynyrd, on their UK farewell tour.

On 14 June 2019, the band announced that they were working on &quot;Backbone&quot;, their 33rd studio album – the first Status Quo studio album not to feature Parfitt. On 25 August 2019, the band appeared on ITV show &quot;The Sara Cox Show&quot; where Rossi spoke about the new album &quot;Backbone&quot; and his autobiography &quot;I Talk Too Much&quot;, after which they performed an upcoming track called &quot;Liberty Lane&quot; as well as &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;. &quot;Backbone&quot; was released on 6 September 2019 and reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart. On 15 September 2019, the band performed at BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Live in Hyde Park&quot; from Hyde Park, London for the third time. They were third from top of the bill, playing in the early evening and followed by Westlife and then The Pet Shop Boys. On Christmas Day 2019, the band appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, performing &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;. In August 2020, Status Quo cancelled their forty-date &quot;Backbone&quot; UK and European tour because of the COVID-19 pandemic; various commitments for the following year meant the band were unable to reschedule the shows in 2021. On 26 September 2021, co-founder Alan Lancaster died at the age of 72 following a battle with multiple sclerosis. 

The band&#x27;s next tour, &quot;Out Out Quoing&quot;, took place in 2022, starting off in the UK, followed by concerts in Germany. On 2 November 2023, Rossi appeared on More4 show &quot;Little Trains and Big Names with Pete Waterman&quot; talking about his childhood and the rise of Status Quo, whilst Waterman helps Rossi to build his first model railway layout. On 10 May 2024, Rossi appeared on ITV daytime show &quot;This Morning&quot; and spoke about his fitness and preparations for the summer shows which will be scheduled for May until late August.

==Touring data==
Status Quo have performed a career total of at least 3,700 documented gigs as of September 2022. After the addition of early undocumented gigs and various lost performances, the concert total is likely to be higher and is estimated by the band to be over 6,000, with an audience in excess of 25 million people. The band have performed over a hundred gigs in a single year several times, with the recorded peak of 144 (1971), averaging a live show every 2.5 days. The band calculated that after 48 years of touring activity, they had &quot;travelled some four million miles and spent 23 years away from home&quot;. With the exceptions of 1980 and 1985, Status Quo embarked on multinational tours every year between 1968 and 2019 (predominantly in Europe, though they have visited every populated continent).

<text>The northern wheatear or wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It is the most widespread member of the wheatear genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; in Europe and North and Central Asia.

The northern wheatear is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in open stony country in Europe and east across the Palearctic with footholds in northeastern Canada and Greenland as well as in northwestern Canada and Alaska. It nests in rock crevices and rabbit burrows. All birds spend most of their winter in Africa.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The northern wheatear was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Motacilla oenanthe&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The generic name, &quot;Oenanthe&quot;, is also the name of a plant genus, the water dropworts, and is derived from the Greek &quot;ainos&quot; &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, from the wine-like scent of the flowers. In the case of the wheatear, it refers to the birds&#x27; return to Greece in the spring at the time that the grapevines blossom.

Its English name has nothing to do with wheat or with ear, but is an altered (perhaps bowdlerised) form of white-arse, which refers to its prominent white rump.

The four generally accepted subspecies of the Northern Wheatear with their breeding range are as follows:
* &quot;O. o. leucorhoa&quot; – northeast Canada, Greenland and Iceland (the &#x27;Greenland wheatear&#x27;)
* &quot;O. o. oenanthe&quot; – north and central Europe through north Asia to east Siberia and northwest North America
* &quot;O. o. libanotica&quot; – southern Europe through the Middle East and southwest Asia to Mongolia and northwest China
* &quot;O. o. seebohmi&quot; – northwest Africa

&quot;O.o. seebohmi&quot; is regarded as a distinct species by some authorities such as the International Ornithological Committee, Seebohm’s or the Atlas wheatear.

==Description==

The northern wheatear is larger than the European robin at in length. The northern wheatear also has a wingspan of 26–32 cm and weighs 17–30 g.

Both sexes have a white rump and tail, with a black inverted T-pattern at the end of the tail.

The plumage of the summer male has grey upperparts, buff throat and black wings and face mask. In autumn it resembles the female apart from the black wings. The female is pale brown above and buff below with darker brown wings. The male has a whistling, crackly song. Its call is a typical chat &quot;chack&quot; noise, and the flight call is the same.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Migration===
The northern wheatear makes one of the longest journeys of any small bird, crossing ocean, ice, and desert. It migrates from Sub-Saharan Africa in spring over a vast area of the Northern Hemisphere that includes northern and central Asia, Europe, Greenland, Alaska, and parts of Canada. In autumn all return to Africa, where their ancestors had wintered. Arguably, some of the birds that breed in north Asia could take a shorter route and winter in south Asia; however, their inherited inclination to migrate takes them back to Africa, completing one of the longest migrations for its body size in the animal kingdom

Birds of the large, bright Greenland race, &quot;leucorhoa&quot;, make one of the longest transoceanic crossings of any passerine. In spring most migrate along a route (commonly used by waders and waterfowl) from Africa via continental Europe, the British Isles, and Iceland to Greenland. However, autumn sightings from ships suggest that some birds cross the North Atlantic directly from Canada and Greenland to southwest Europe, a distance of up to . Birds breeding in eastern Canada are thought to fly from Baffin Island and Newfoundland via Greenland, Ireland, and Portugal to the Azores, crossing of the North Atlantic) before flying onwards to Africa. Other populations from western Canada and Alaska migrate by flying over much of Eurasia to Africa.

Miniature tracking devices have recently shown that the northern wheatear has one of the longest migratory flights known - 30,000 km (18,640 miles), from sub-Saharan Africa to their Arctic breeding grounds.
&quot;The Alaskan birds travelled almost 15,000km (9,000 miles) each way - crossing Siberia and the Arabian Desert, and travelling, on average, 290km per day. &quot;This is the longest recorded migration for a songbird as far as we know,&quot; said Dr Schmaljohann.

===Breeding===
Northern wheatears first breed when they are one year old. The nest is built entirely by the female while the male perches nearby, sings and sometimes performs song-flights. The nest is placed in a cavity such as a rabbit burrow, a crevice among rocks or in a man-made object such as a wall or pipe. The nest typically has a foundation of untidy plant material. The nest cup is constructed of finer grasses, leaves, moss and lichen. The female lays eggs at daily intervals. The clutch is 4–7 smooth but not glossy eggs that are around in size with an average weight of . The eggs are very pale blue in colour and sometimes have a few red-brown marks at the larger end. They are incubated almost entirely by the female beginning after the penultimate or final egg has been laid. The eggs hatch after approximately 13 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and are brooded by the female for the first five or six days. They fledge after 15 days and become independent of their parents when they are between 28 and 32 days old. Normally only a single brood is raised each year but when a clutch of eggs is lost, the female will lay a second clutch.

==Status and conservation==
The northern wheatear has an extensive range, estimated at 2.3 million square kilometres (0.87 million square miles), and a large population estimated at 2.9 million individuals in the Old World and the Americas combined. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.

==Relationship with humans==
In the 18th and 19th centuries wheatears were considered a delicacy in England, called &quot;the English ortolan&quot; and Sussex shepherds supplemented their income by selling the birds they trapped.

<doc id="212301" wikidata="Q217925" url="?curid=212301" title="Champ de Mars">
<text>The Champ de Mars (; ) is a large public greenspace in Paris, France, located in the seventh &quot;arrondissement&quot;, between the Eiffel Tower to the northwest and the École Militaire to the southeast. The park is named after the Campus Martius (&quot;Mars Field&quot;) in Rome, which was dedicated to the god Mars. The name alludes to the fact that the lawns here were formerly used as drilling and marching grounds by the French military.

The nearest Métro stations are La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle, École Militaire, and Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel, an RER suburban-commuter-railway station. A disused station, Champ de Mars, is also nearby.

==History==
Originally, the Champ de Mars was part of a large flat open area called Grenelle, which was reserved for market gardening. Citizens would claim small plots and exploit them by growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers for the local market. However, the plain of Grenelle was not an especially fertile place for farming.

The construction, in 1765, of the &quot;École Militaire&quot; designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, was the first step toward the Champ de Mars in its present form. Grounds for military drills were originally planned for an area south of the school, the current location of the &quot;place de Fontenoy&quot;. The choice to build an esplanade to the north of the school led to the erection of the noble facade which today encloses the Champ de Mars. The planners leveled the ground, surrounded it with a large ditch and a long avenue of elms, and, as a final touch, the esplanade was enclosed by a fine grille-work fence.

The Isle of Swans, formerly a riverine islet at the location of the northeastern foot of the Eiffel Tower, was, for the sake of symmetry and pleasing perspectives, attached to the shore. (The Isle of Swans discussed here should not be confused with the Isle of Swans that sits in the middle of the Seine downstream and around the next bend in the river, between the fifteenth and sixteenth arrondissements.)

Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world&#x27;s first hydrogen-filled balloon from the Champ-de-Mars on 27 August 1783.

This place witnessed the spectacle and pageantry of some of the best-remembered festivals of the French Revolution. On 14 July 1790 the first &quot;Federation Day&quot; celebration (&quot;fête de la Fédération&quot;), now known as Bastille Day, was held on the Champ de Mars, exactly one year after the storming of the prison. The following year, on 17 July 1791, the massacre on the Champ de Mars took place. Jean Sylvain Bailly, the first mayor of Paris, became a victim of his own revolution, and was guillotined there on 12 November 1793.

The Champ de Mars was also the site of the Festival of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794. With a design by the painter Jacques-Louis David, a massive &quot;Altar of the Nation&quot; was built atop an artificial mountain and surmounted by a tree of liberty. The festival is regarded as the most successful of its type in the Revolution. During the Hundred Days a restored Napoleon held the Champ de Mai ceremony, during which he swore to uphold the Charter of 1815, at the Champ de Mars.

The Champ de Mars was the site of Expositions Universelles in 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900, and 1937.

==In art, culture, film and sport==

===Art and culture===

In 2012, the United Buddy Bears exhibit was held on the Champ de Mars, an international art exhibition with more than 140 two-meter-tall bears representing individual countries. They promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding and are displayed across the planet. They stand at Champ de Mars in Paris, fronting the Eiffel Tower.

===Use in film and television===
Champ de Mars was used as a filming location in the 1985 James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, in which Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) drove a Renault 11 taxi which he had hijacked at the Eiffel Tower in pursuit of a mysterious assassin, later revealed to be May Day (Grace Jones).

===Sports===

Champ de Mars contains both a basketball court and a football field. For the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, a temporary stadium known as the Eiffel Tower Stadium () was erected atop the Place Jacques-Rueff, and hosted the beach volleyball and blind football tournaments at the games. The Grand Palais Éphémère was built in 2021 at the south end of the Champ to host Olympic events and conventions displaced by the renovation of the Grand Palais. Portions of the opening ceremony were held at the Champ.

<text>David Avidan (; February 21, 1934 – May 11, 1995) was an Israeli &quot;poet, painter, filmmaker, publicist, and playwright&quot; (as he often put it). He wrote 20 published books of Hebrew poetry.

==Biography and literary career==
He was born in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine, and studied Literature and Philosophy while briefly studying at Hebrew University. He wrote mostly in Hebrew, and was an avant-garde artist throughout his life. He translated many of his own poems into English, and received several awards both as a poet and as a translator.

He was not popular with most critics or the general public throughout his life, often criticized as being egocentric, chauvinistic, and technocratic. His first book, &quot;Lipless Faucets&quot; (1954), was attacked by nearly all poetry critics; the first favorable review was by Gabriel Moked, editor of the literary quarterly &quot;Akhshav&quot;, who later became one of Avidan&#x27;s closest friends.

By the early 1990s he could scarcely make a living, and his mental condition had deteriorated. Avidan died in Tel Aviv, the city which had played a central role in his life, and was, in many ways, the center of his creation.

Avidan died on May 11, 1995, in his Tel Aviv apartment at the age of 61. Since his death, Avidan&#x27;s reputation has been on the rise both in literary circles and in the popular imagination, positioning him as one of the core poets of the Israeli canon. A volume of Selected Poems by Avidan, &quot;Futureman,&quot; translated by Tsipi Keller, has been published by Phoneme Media in 2017.

==Awards==
In 1993, Avidan was the co-recipient (jointly with Amalia Kahana-Carmon) of the Bialik Prize for Hebrew literature.

==Movies==
* &quot;Message from the Future&quot;, a 1981 Israeli film Avidan wrote, directed and starred in, is a science fiction movie in English about future humans visiting present-day Israel. In the year 3005, a man is sent back to 1985 to convince the present leaders make certain that World War III happens, which he guarantees will make for a better future. Having already caused natural disasters and catastrophes by coming back from the future, he now tries to force his message on the world press and TV. Sheldon Teitelbaum has judged the film &#x27;execrable&#x27;.

<doc id="212316" wikidata="Q868046" url="?curid=212316" title="Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture">
<text>Xishuangbanna, sometimes shortened to Banna, is one of the eight autonomous prefectures of Yunnan Province. The autonomous prefecture for Dai people is in the extreme south of Yunnan province, China, bordering both Myanmar and Laos. Xishuangbanna lies at latitude 21°10′-22°40′ and longitude 99°55′-101°50′ east, on the northern edge of the tropics south of the Tropic of Cancer. It has an area of 19,124.5 square kilometers, bordering Pu&#x27;er City to the northeast and northwest, Laos to the southeast and Myanmar to the southwest. The border is 966.3 kilometers long, one river connects six countries, and there are four national ports. The prefectural seat is Jinghong, the largest settlement in the area and one that straddles the Mekong, called the &quot;Lancang River&quot; in Chinese.

This region of China is noted for the distinct culture of its ethnic groups, which is very different from that of the Han Chinese. The people, architecture, language and culture more closely resemble those of the Shan, Dai and Tai peoples, which includes the Thai and Lao.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sibsongpanna&quot; (Tai Lue: ; ; ; ) is a Tai Lü compound consisting of &quot;sipsong&quot; (, &#x27;twelve&#x27;), &quot;pan&quot; (, &#x27;township&#x27;) and &quot;na&quot; (, &#x27;rice paddy&#x27;). The name refers to the traditional division of the &quot;mueang&quot; into twelve districts, which were called &quot;panna&quot; (). The etymology is parallel to the autonomous Tai-speaking region in French Indochina from 1890 to 1945 that was called Sip Song Chau Tai, meaning &#x27;twelve Tai cantons&#x27;. Xishuangbanna was mentioned as ancestral land &quot;Möng Ri Möng Ram&quot; in Tai-Ahom Manuscript &quot;Lit Phi&quot; written by Ahom descendants of Dai people of Yunnan who later migrated to Assam.

==History==

Before 1886, the region was called Chiang Hung, a Tai Lue kingdom that was contended between China, Lanna and the Burmese dynasties. After the Mongol conquest in 1296, the subsequent Ming and Qing emperors appointed the Tai Lue rulers of Chiang Hung as a native &quot;Tusi&quot; governor. In 1563, King Bayinnaung of Burma&#x27;s Taungoo Dynasty captured Chiang Hung. The Burmese and the Chinese agreed on the joint domination over Xishuangbanna, whose ruler was enthroned in a ceremony in which both Burmese and Chinese representatives jointly presided.

In the 19th century, the region briefly became a tributary state of Luang Prabang and the Rattanakosin Kingdom during the Burmese–Siamese War (1849–1855). When the British Empire occupied Upper Burma in 1886, it became a part of the British Raj. In 1892, the British transferred Chiang Hung to the Qing dynasty.

In the chaos of the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing government in 1911 in favor of a Chinese republican government, a local leader, the Chao Maha of Meng Jie, staged a rebellion against Qing remnant officials. The Yunnan provincial government of the newly established Republic of China sent troops in 1913 to oust the Chao Meng Jie rebels. Ke Shuxun remained in Xishuangbanna to govern with his &quot;13 Principles of Governing the Frontier&quot;, which emphasized equality between Han and Dai in areas such as land ownership and taxation; allowed intermarriage between the ethnic groups; and promoted education in secular and technical subjects, rather than Burmese-based monastic education. The Second Sino-Japanese War (1931-1945) saw the heavy bombardment of Xishuangbanna by Japanese troops and a simultaneous influx of Pan-Taiist propaganda from Japan&#x27;s ally, Thailand. According to Hsieh, that reduced the appeal of a broad pan-Tai identity among the Dai Lue.

During the final phase of the Chinese Civil War, many remnants of the Kuomintang fled from Chinese Communists forces into Burma&#x27;s Shan State from Xishuangbanna. The new People&#x27;s Republic of China sent various non-military expeditions to Xishuangbanna from 1949 to provide services such as schools and hospitals to replace those by western Christian missionaries.

The Communists took control of the prefecture from Kuomintang loyalists in 1952. On January 23, 1953, the PRC established the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and ended the native-chieftain system. That year, the People&#x27;s Congress of Xishuangbanna created the New Tai Lue alphabet, based on the Tai Tham alphabet, to print material in the Tai Lü language.

Xishuangbanna was made an autonomous prefecture in 1955 but lost some territory on the creation of Jingdong Yi Autonomous County and Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County. Land reform started in earnest in January 1956, destroying the power of the village headmen. State-owned rubber plantations accounted for most of the region&#x27;s wealth during the early communist period.

Xishuangbanna also received an influx of educated youth during the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) during which Buddhist temples in Xishuangbanna were used as barns. They were restored to their original purpose only in 1981.

In 1987, the Xishuangbanna government promulgated the &quot;Law of the Xishuangbanna Dai Nationality Autonomous Prefecture for Self-government&quot; to bring local laws into line with the national &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for Regional National Autonomy&quot;.

Shao Cunxin (, 1922–2015), the former head of the chieftain&#x27;s outer council (1944–1950) and chief of Meng Peng (1938–1950), was the chief of the autonomous prefecture from 1955 to 1992.

==Administrative subdivisions==
Xishuangbanna governs one county-level city and two counties.
* 

==Geography==
The prefecture has an area of . Xishuangbanna is the home of the Dai people. The region sits at a lower altitude than most of Yunnan, and has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;).

==Biodiversity==
Xishuangbanna harbors much of the biodiversity of Yunnan, which harbors much of the biodiversity of China. Its tropical climate and its remoteness until recent times account for this. In addition to an abundance of plants, Xishuangbanna is home to the last few Asian elephants still in China; the species roamed over a large part of the country even as late as a few hundred years ago. The elephants are protected in a reserve, but the plant diversity is threatened by, and has for five decades been threatened by, the proliferation of natural rubber plantations which completely destroy the rainforest and replace it with a monoculture of trees originally from Brazil.

&quot;Passiflora xishuangbannaensis&quot; is a recently discovered passiflora species that is endemic to Xishuangbanna.

== Demographics ==
The 2000 national census documented that Xishuangbanna had 993,397 inhabitants with a population density of 50.43 inhabitants per km2. According to the 2000 national census, Dai people make up the plurality at 29.89%, with the Han Chinese coming in at a close second at 29.11%. At the time of the 1977 census, however, Han people made up the largest single ethnic group in Xishuangbanna, making up 36.53% of a population of 627,089, while Dai made up 33.15%, and others 30.32%. The Xishuangbanna government has strived to maintain this ethnic balance of around 33% of each group: Han, Dai, and other; this policy is known as &quot;the plan of three-three-three&quot; ().

Before the increasing social mobility of the 1940s, inhabitants of Xishuangbanna called each other &quot;basin people&quot; () or &quot;mountain people&quot; () in reference to the groups&#x27; stereotyped location. The Han and Dai lived mostly around the mountains and played a socially dominant role, while the non-Dai ethnic minorities lived in the basins and were politically disenfranchised. The Dai used to be called the &quot;Baiyi&quot; (), and until a 1936 Kuomintang reform, the &quot;bai&quot; part was written with the dog radical (). The PRC government decided that regardless of radical, the term &quot;Baiyi&quot; is pejorative, and adopted &quot;Dai&quot; () instead. Historically, some ethnic minorities adapted some Dai characteristics in order to alleviate discrimination and increase their social status, such as the Blang people adopting the sarong, practicing matrilocal residence, and learning the Tai Tham alphabet.

<doc id="212318" wikidata="Q900525" url="?curid=212318" title="Overseas Private Investment Corporation">
<text>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was the United States Government&#x27;s Development finance institution until it merged with the Development Credit Authority (DCA) of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to form the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). OPIC mobilized private capital to help solve critical development challenges and in doing so, advanced the foreign policy of the United States and national security objectives.

By working with the U.S. private sector, OPIC helped U.S. businesses gain footholds in emerging markets, catalyzing revenues, jobs, and growth opportunities both at home and abroad. It achieved its mission by providing investors with financing, political risk insurance, and support for private equity investment funds when commercial funding could not be obtained elsewhere. Established as an agency of the U.S. government in 1971, OPIC operated on a self-sustaining basis at no net cost to American taxpayers.

==Products and services==
===Financing===
OPIC helped provide medium-term to long-term funding through direct loans and loan guarantees to eligible investment projects in developing countries and emerging markets. By complementing the private sector, OPIC used to provide financing in countries where commercial financial institutions often are reluctant or unable to lend.

Recognizing that businesses both large and small played an important role in developing nations, OPIC made it a priority to work with American small businesses, which comprised, on average, 80 percent of projects supported by the agency. OPIC&#x27;s Department of Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Finance offered qualified small businesses a streamlined approval process and direct loans from $100,000 to $10 million with terms from three to 15 years. While the eligible U.S. small business must have owned at least 25 percent of the overseas project, OPIC used to be able to finance up to 65 percent of the total project cost. OPIC had conducted more than a dozen small business workshops around the United States since 2006, educating nearly 1,600 business owners about OPIC products and services.

===Political risk insurance===
OPIC&#x27;s political risk insurance enabled U.S. businesses to take advantage of commercially attractive opportunities in emerging markets, mitigating risk and helping them compete in a global marketplace. OPIC helped U.S. investors protect their investments in a variety of situations, including political violence, expropriation or other government interference, and currency inconvertibility.

===Investment funds===
OPIC provided support for the creation of privately owned and managed investment funds. These funds make direct equity and equity-related investments in new, expanding, or privatizing emerging market companies. OPIC-supported funds helped emerging market economies access long-term growth capital, management skills, and financial expertise, all of which are key factors in expanding economic development for people in developing nations.

===Investment projects===
OPIC supported projects in a range of industries—from energy to housing, agriculture, financial services, etc. It focused on regions where the need was greatest and in sectors that could have the greatest developmental impact. OPIC had increasingly focused on projects that encouraged the use of renewable resources, which represented not only an urgent global need but also a significant investment opportunity.
Another key priority was impact investing, which aimed to produce positive social impacts while generating financial returns sufficient to make projects sustainable.

== Initiatives ==

===Connect Africa===
In July 2018, OPIC launched its Connect Africa Initiative which aimed to fund more projects which would target infrastructure, technology, and value chains in Africa. With projects within Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for over one-quarter of OPIC&#x27;s portfolio, the region was a key area of focus for the corporation. Through Connect Africa, OPIC had pledged $1 billion over three years to projects supporting telecommunications and internet access, value chains that connect producers of raw materials to end-users, and essential infrastructures, such as roads, railways, ports, and airports. These commitments to connectivity support economic growth and increase regional security.

This initiative built upon the Power Africa Project launched during the Obama administration that committed to spending $1.5 billion in energy investments on the continent over a five-year span.

Some examples of investment projects under the Connect Africa Initiative were a $125 million loan to help the diamond industry become more sustainable in Botswana and the commitment of $100 million to expand mobile networks and technological infrastructure across the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda.

This initiative will be continued under the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). In June 2021, The DFC and G7 nations pledged $80 billion to the continent.

=== 2X Women&#x27;s Initiative ===
Launched in March 2018, OPIC&#x27;s 2X Women&#x27;s Initiative was a commitment to mobilize $1 billion in capital to invest in women in developing countries. To decide which projects to invest in, OPIC utilized gender lens investing which called for applying gender analysis to financial analysis – using capital to impact the lives of women.

Having exceeded their investment goal by the end of the financial year, OPIC had challenged other G7 countries to join in the 2X Challenge which organized DFIs from around the world to take part in achieving gender equality through private investment.

A popular example of the projects was, financially backing WaterHealth in India to create WaterHealth Vending Machines (WVM) in heavily populated areas. Thereby increasing women, and their families, access to clean drinking water. Another example was a $5 million loan for Twiga Foods in Kenya, aimed to combat food scarcity.

This initiative will be continued under the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

Another key priority is impact investing, which aims to produce positive social impacts while generating financial returns sufficient to make these projects sustainable. OPIC has been committed to providing $1.5 billion to develop energy projects in Africa over the next five years, in support of President Obama&#x27;s Power Africa initiative to double the number of people on the continent who have access to electricity. The Power Africa initiative will help African countries develop more of their extensive energy resources, including oil and gas, geothermal, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass, while also building out power generation and transmission infrastructure.

==Eligibility requirements==
OPIC required that its projects have a meaningful connection to the U.S. private sector. For financing, this meant a U.S. organized entity with 25 percent or more U.S. owned equity or a majority U.S. owned foreign-organized entity run by U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and U.S.-organized non-governmental organizations. OPIC has not supported projects that negatively affected the U.S. economy. 

==Environmental and social standards==
OPIC projects had to meet congressionally mandated requirements regarding the protection of the environment, social impacts, health, and safety. The guidelines and procedures were based in large part on environmental and social impact assessment procedures applied by organizations such as the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Projects that were likely to have significant adverse environmental or social impacts are disclosed to the public for a comment period of 60 days.

==History==

In the American effort to rebuild Europe following World War II, it became clear to the policymakers that private investment is a powerful generator of economic development and that there is an appropriate role for government in encouraging private investment where it has the potential to do the most good. Accordingly, the Marshall Plan authorized the U.S. government to ensure private U.S. investors against the risk that earnings generated overseas in foreign currencies might not be convertible into U.S. dollars. This new tool—political risk insurance—was expanded in the 1950s to cover losses from war and expropriation, as well as government interference with investors&#x27; rights to the proceeds of their investments. It was subsequently complemented with the addition of project financing.

In 1966, Congress established the International Private Investment Advisory Council (IPIAC) under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1966. In December 1968, IPIAC published &quot;The Case for a U.S. Overseas Private Enterprise Development Corporation&quot;, a report articulating the need for such an entity. The IPIAC in the report recommended the organization of an overseas private enterprise development corporation of the United States and also funded by it, as responsive to the Javits Amendment to the 1968 Foreign Assistance Act.

As the administration of the U.S. guaranty program moved among various agencies, bipartisan support grew to establish it on a permanent basis as a self-sustaining, independent agency.

Congress created OPIC in 1969 through an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, and the agency began operations in 1971, during the Nixon administration, with a portfolio of $8.4 billion in political risk insurance and $169 million in loan guaranties. In a special message to Congress in 1971, President Nixon stated that OPIC&#x27;s establishment will help &quot;give new direction to U.S. private investment abroad ... and provide new focus to our foreign assistance effort.&quot;

Organized as a corporation with a corporate structure, OPIC is governed by a Board of Directors, President and CEO, and Executive Vice President, all nominated by the President of the United States and approved by the U.S. Senate. The majority of the Board of Directors, including its president, are &quot;drawn from private life and have business experience.&quot; Although it operates on a self-sustaining basis at no net cost to American taxpayers, OPIC is appropriated administrative funding, and reauthorized on a regular basis, by the U.S. Congress.

== Leadership ==

The organization has had various presidents and CEO from different backgrounds.

== Criticism ==
In the 2000s, Friends of the Earth; Greenpeace; and the cities of Boulder, Arcata, and Oakland won against the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (and the Export-Import Bank of the United States), which were accused of financing fossil-fuel projects detrimental to a stable climate in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act in a case filed in 2002 and settled in 2009.

<doc id="212328" wikidata="Q3476766" url="?curid=212328" title="Sean O'Grady (boxer)">
<text>Sean O&#x27;Grady (born February 10, 1959) is the former WBA Lightweight Champion of the World, and currently an American commercial realtor. 
O&#x27;Grady had a record of 81 wins and five losses as a professional boxer, with 70 wins by knockout.

O&#x27;Grady is also a college graduate, boxing analyst, television personality, actor and former teen idol across the United States Midwest.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Grady was born in Austin, Texas. The son of boxing trainer Pat O&#x27;Grady and boxing promoter Jean O&#x27;Grady, he moved around a lot when he was a younger kid, but his family settled in Oklahoma City, when he was 11 years old.

==Boxing career==
O&#x27;Grady started boxing professionally in 1975. In 1980, he had his first world title try, when the World Boxing Council lightweight champion Jim Watt gave him an opportunity to fight for the title. O&#x27;Grady travelled to Scotland to fight Watt, but sustained a cut over the forehead due to a head butt late in the bout and lost by a technical knockout in round 12. The O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s protested the fight&#x27;s result 24 hours later while in Ireland, arguing that the cut had been caused by the headbutt, not a punch. Because of the controversy surrounding the fight, the World Boxing Association lightweight champion, Hilmer Kenty, gave O&#x27;Grady another opportunity at the title. They met on April 12, 1981. O&#x27;Grady again suffered a cut early in the bout, but he dropped Kenty in rounds two and eight and won a unanimous decision.
In part because of problems with his manager/father, he never defended the WBA title and was eventually stripped of it. Pat O&#x27;Grady then formed the little-regarded (and very short lived) World Athletic Association to recognize Sean as a champion. O&#x27;Grady promptly lost this &quot;championship&quot; to Andy Ganigan of Hawaii.

He regularly chewed bubble gum upon entering the ring prior to fights, and because of this, he earned the nickname &quot;Bubble Gum Bomber.&quot;

==Professional boxing record==

==TV analyst==
O&#x27;Grady served as analyst for television boxing show &quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot; which aired from October 1982 to August 1998 on the USA Network.

<doc id="212330" wikidata="Q2122650" url="?curid=212330" title="Lye">
<text>Lye is a hydroxide, either sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The word lye most accurately refers to sodium hydroxide (NaOH), but historically has been conflated to include other alkali materials, most notably potassium hydroxide (KOH). In order to distinguish between the two, sodium hydroxide may be referred to as soda lye while potassium hydroxide may be referred to as potash lye.

Traditionally, it was obtained by using rainwater to leach wood ashes (which are highly soluble in water and strongly alkaline) of their potassium hydroxide (KOH). A caustic basic solution is produced, called lye water. Then, the lye water would either be used as such, as for curing olives before brining them, or be evaporated of water to produce crystalline lye. 

Today, lye is commercially manufactured using a membrane cell chloralkali process. It is supplied in various forms such as flakes, pellets, microbeads, coarse powder or a solution. Lye has traditionally been used as a major ingredient in soapmaking.

==Etymology==
The English word has cognates in all Germanic languages, and originally designated a bath or hot spring.

== Uses ==

=== Food ===
Lyes are used to cure many types of food, including the traditional Nordic lutefisk, olives (making them less bitter), canned mandarin oranges, hominy, lye rolls, century eggs, pretzels, candied pumpkins, and bagels. They are also used as a tenderizer in the crust of baked Cantonese moon cakes, in &quot;zongzi&quot; (glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves), in chewy southern Chinese noodles popular in Hong Kong and southern China, and in Japanese ramen noodles. Lye provides the crisp glaze on hard pretzels. It&#x27;s used in kutsinta, a type of rice cake from the Philippines together with pitsi-pitsî. In Assam, north east India, extensive use is made of a type of lye called khar in Assamese and karwi in Boro which is obtained by filtering the ashes of various banana stems, roots and skin in their cooking and also for curing, as medicine and as a substitute for soap. Lye made out of wood ashes is also used in the nixtamalization process of hominy corn by the tribes of the Eastern Woodlands in North America.

In the United States, food-grade lye must meet the requirements outlined in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), as prescribed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lower grades of lye that are unsuitable for use in food preparation are commonly used as drain cleaners and oven cleaners.

=== Soap ===
Both sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are used in making soap. Potassium hydroxide soaps are softer and more easily dissolved in water than sodium hydroxide soaps. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are not interchangeable in either the proportions required or the properties produced in making soaps.

&quot;Hot process&quot; soap making also uses lye as the main ingredient. Lye is added to water, cooled for a few minutes and then added to oils and butters. The mixture is then cooked over a period of time (1–2 hours), typically in a slow cooker, and then placed into a mold.

=== Household ===

Lyes are also valued for their cleaning effects. Sodium hydroxide is commonly the major constituent in commercial and industrial oven cleaners and clogged drain openers, due to its grease-dissolving abilities. Lyes decompose greases via alkaline ester hydrolysis, yielding water-soluble residues that are easily removed by rinsing.

=== Tissue digestion ===
Sodium or potassium hydroxide can be used to digest tissues of animal carcasses. Often referred to as alkaline hydrolysis, the process involves placing the animal carcass into a sealed chamber, adding a mixture of lye and water and the application of heat to accelerate the process. After several hours the chamber will contain a liquid with coffee-like appearance, and the only solids that remain are very fragile bone hulls of mostly calcium phosphate, which can be mechanically crushed to a fine powder with very little force. Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing roadkill dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors. Due to its low cost and easy availability, it has also been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian serial killer Leonarda Cianciulli used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap. In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted to having disposed of more than 300 bodies with it.

=== Fungus identification ===
A 3–10% solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) gives a color change in some species of mushrooms:
* In &quot;Agaricus&quot;, some species such as A. xanthodermus turn yellow with KOH, many have no reaction, and &quot;A. subrutilescens&quot; turns green.
* Distinctive change occurs for some species of &quot;Cortinarius&quot; and boletes

== Safety ==
=== First aid ===
When a person has been exposed to lye, sources recommend immediate removal of contaminated clothing/materials, gently brushing/wiping excess off of skin, and then flushing the area of exposure with running water for 15–60 minutes as well as contacting emergency services.

=== Protection ===
Personal protective equipment including safety glasses, chemical-resistant gloves, and adequate ventilation are required for the safe handling of lye. When in proximity to lye that is dissolving in an open container of water, the use of a vapor-resistant face mask is recommended. Adding lye too quickly can cause a runaway thermal reaction which can result in the mixture boiling or erupting.

=== Storage ===
Lye in its solid state is deliquescent and has a strong affinity for moisture in the air. As a result, lye will dissolve when exposed to open air, absorbing large amounts of atmospheric moisture. Accordingly, lye is stored in air-tight (and correspondingly moisture tight) containers. Glass is not a good material to be used for storage as severe alkalis are mildly corrosive to it. Similar to the case of other corrosives, the containers should be labeled to indicate the potential danger of the contents and stored away from children, pets, heat, and moisture.

=== Hazardous reactions ===
The majority of safety concerns with lye are also common with most corrosives, such as their potentially destructive effects on living tissues; examples are the skin, flesh, and the cornea. Solutions containing lyes can cause chemical burns, permanent injuries, scarring and blindness, immediately upon contact. Lyes may be harmful or even fatal if swallowed; ingestion can cause esophageal stricture. Moreover, the solvation of dry solid lye is highly exothermic and the resulting heat may cause additional burns or ignite flammables.

The reaction between sodium hydroxide and some metals is also hazardous. Aluminium, magnesium, zinc, tin, chromium, brass and bronze all react with lye to produce hydrogen gas. Since hydrogen is flammable, mixing a large quantity of lye with aluminium could result in an explosion. Both the potassium and sodium forms are able to dissolve copper.

<text>The Vaqueros de Bayamón is a professional basketball team based in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, actively participating in the National Superior Basketball League (BSN). Founded in 1930, the team has been a significant participant in the development of basketball in Puerto Rico. They stage their home games at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum. As of 2023, the Vaqueros have secured a total of 16 BSN championships, the most in the League&#x27;s history. The team also holds a league record for winning 29 games during their 1993 season. The Vaqueros de Bayamón&#x27;s contributions to the BSN have been instrumental in Puerto Rico&#x27;s representation in the global basketball scene.

== Franchise history ==
Established in 1930, the Vaqueros de Bayamon—initially known as &quot;Bayamon&quot;—quickly made their mark in the amateur Baloncesto Nacional league, now the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). Under the guidance of Professional Head Coach Onofre Carballeira, they clinched their first league championships in 1933 and 1935. However, the team&#x27;s momentum was interrupted in the 1940s due to WWII, and their participation only resumed in 1954.

With the return of competition, the team underwent a rebranding as the Azules de Bayamón (lit. &quot;Bayamon Blues&quot;), led by Coach Félix Joglar. Despite the renewed effort, the team did not secure any titles that season.

The team entered its modern era shortly after, rebranding as &quot;Los Vaqueros de Bayamon&quot; in 1955, the new name was inspired by their new sponsor, Espasas Dairy Company. This era marked a significant comeback for the team.

During this time, the Vaqueros roster boasted remarkable talents. Evelio &quot;El Potro&quot; Droz, who joined in 1957, quickly became a star, leading the league in scoring with 407 points in 1959, and representing Puerto Rico in the Central American and Caribbean Games in Venezuela. Martin Ansa, known as one of the most offensive players in Puerto Rican basketball history, joined the team in 1960 and won the scoring title with 405 points.

In 1967, the Vaqueros secured a championship win against the Ponce team, their third championship and their first in 32 years. This victory, partially attributed to the sportsmanship and skills of players like Julio Toro, marked the beginning of a resurgence for the Vaqueros. They consolidated this newfound reputation with another championship in 1969.

The 1970s became a golden era for the Vaqueros, with the team winning five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975. Under the influence of notable coaches such as Roy Rubbins, Art Loche, Lou Rossini, Fufi Santori, Tom Nissalke, and Del Harris, the Vaqueros continued to excel. Fufi Santori, a figure renowned both as a player and coach, played a pivotal role during this period, as did exceptional defensive player Alberto Samot.

As the 1980s arrived, competition in the BSN intensified, particularly against the Guaynabo Mets team, led by Mario Morales and Federico Lopez. The Vaqueros emerged victorious in the final series against Guaynabo in 1981, adding another championship to their collection.

The team&#x27;s fanbase saw considerable growth in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1988, under the guidance of Robert Corn, the Vaqueros clinched yet another championship against the &quot;Indios de Canovanas&quot;. They secured further championships in 1995 and 1996 against the Ponce Lions, with Flor Melendez serving as head coach.

The late 1990s and the early 2000s, however, proved to be a challenging period for the Vaqueros. From 1999 to 2008, the team often struggled to advance beyond the semifinals, only making it to the finals in 2005, where they were defeated by the Arecibo Captains. This period marked a decline in the franchise&#x27;s performance, prestige, and fanbase.

The team&#x27;s fortunes turned in 2009 when new management sought to invest heavily in the franchise recruiting talents like: Christian Dalmau, Orlando &#x27;Guayacan&#x27; Santiago, Carmelo Lee, Danny Santiago and Olumide Oyedeji; that year they won a championship against Quebradillas, effectively ending a decade of stagnation. Although the 2010s saw a competitive yet unsuccessful championship bid, marking their first title-less decade since the 1950s, the Vaqueros found their stride again in the next decade. Under the leadership of Coach Nelson Colon, they celebrated championship wins in 2020 ( a condensed tournament season given the extraordinary COVID-19 pandemic) and again in 2022, bringing their total league titles to sixteen. As a result, they surpassed the San German Athletics in the league&#x27;s historical standings. As of now, the Vaqueros de Bayamon are the reigning champions in the BSN league, demonstrating a remarkable return to form in the current decade.

== Team&#x27;s Identity ==

=== Apparel and Branding ===
The team has showcased various colors in their uniforms throughout their history. However, the colors most closely associated with the franchise are blue, white, and gold, reflecting the colors found in the municipality&#x27;s flag. In earlier decades, the team also wore red uniforms. Occasionally, the team revives the red colors for special &quot;retro&quot; nights, evoking nostalgia. In 2022, the Vaqueros won their latest championship while wearing red uniforms against the Atléticos de San Germán. The team&#x27;s uniform choices have played a significant role in its branding and the color schemes of their home court.

Currently, the team has two official sets of uniforms: a white with blue trim and stripes Home uniform and blue with white trim Visitor uniform. Both sets share a near-identical design, featuring the team&#x27;s name prominently displayed on the front above the number. On the back, the player&#x27;s last name is positioned below the number, accompanied by the Vaqueros&#x27; logo.

=== Arena ===
The Vaqueros de Bayamón play their home games at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum, an arena inaugurated in 1988 and named after the team&#x27;s former player. As Puerto Rico&#x27;s third-largest indoor sports venue, the coliseum can comfortably host up to 12,000 fans, though it has been known to accommodate nearly 16,000 spectators during the team&#x27;s finals.

The seating arrangement within the coliseum is divided into three sections:

*Box area (Palco) – blue section
*Middle area (Preferencia) – yellow section
*General area – orange section

Prior to the opening of the Rubén Rodriguez Coliseum in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Vaqueros played their home games at the &quot;Cancha José &quot;Pepín&quot; Cestero&quot;, a smaller indoor court also situated in Bayamón.

=== Fan base ===
Renowned for its extensive fandom, the Vaqueros experienced a slight decrease in support from 2000 to 2008, a period marked by limited success and no championships. At its peak in the 1990s, the Vaqueros&#x27; fanbase boasted over 12,000 fervent followers. A revival of enthusiasm was evident in the 2009 season, when the team clinched their 14th championship and witnessed a surge in attendance, drawing an estimated 14,000 spectators to the final game, over 11,000 of whom were estimated to be Vaqueros fans.

In the 2014 Regular Season, amid a stagnant decade for the team, their Arena still managed to average an impressive attendance of 4,723 fans per game, placing them amongst the BSN&#x27;s most supported teams. The Vaqueros&#x27; fervor extends to selling out every home final game since their golden era in the 1970s, earning them recognition as one of the BSN&#x27;s most significant franchises according to numerous commentators.

Since 1982 the teams mascot has been Moncho Loubriel.

=== Rivalries ===
The Vaqueros de Bayamón have been involved in significant rivalries throughout their history, often facing off against certain teams in multiple finals. Notable rivalries include:

*The Ponce Lions: A fierce rivalry that emerged during the late 1960s and resurfaced in the mid-1990s, showcasing intense competition between the Vaqueros and the Lions.

*The Quebradillas Pirates: A rivalry spanning from the early 1970s to the late 1990s, and reignited in 2009 with the addition of a key player, Dalmau, to the Vaqueros&#x27; roster. This renewed rivalry has seen both teams reaching the finals on multiple occasions.

*Río Piedras: An intense matchup between the Vaqueros and Río Piedras, highlighted by their encounters in 1969 and 1971.

*Guaynabo Mets: An engaging rivalry that unfolded in the early 1980s, featuring captivating contests between the Vaqueros and the Guaynabo Mets.

*Capitanes de Arecibo: A notable rivalry that emerged in 2005, with subsequent encounters in 2010 and 2018, showcasing fierce competition between the Vaqueros and the Capitanes de Arecibo.

*Vega Baja: A rivalry rooted in the early years of the franchise, specifically from 1933 to 1934, when the Vaqueros faced off against Vega Baja in memorable battles.

=== Sponsors ===
In a longstanding partnership, the Vaqueros de Bayamón have enjoyed major sponsorship from Goya foods, a renowned food company with a factory based in Bayamón. Goya has been a significant sponsor of the team for 37 seasons, providing financial support and fostering a strong connection between the Vaqueros and the local industry.

==Players==
===Current roster===

During the 2023 season, the Vaqueros maintained a very similar roster to the one that earned them the 2022 season title. 








==Notable players==
*Wenyen Gabriel

==Rubén Rodríguez==

Rubén Rodríguez, a stalwart of the Vaqueros de Bayamón, dedicated 23 seasons to the team, consistently donning the number 15 jersey. His debut season was in 1969, and over the course of his career, he amassed a substantial total of 11,549 points and 6,178 rebounds across 631 games, setting several significant records in the process:

*Career Points: 11,549
*Season Points: 810 (1979)
*Single Game Points: 52 (1973)
*Career Rebounds: 6,178

Rodríguez&#x27;s record for rebounds in a season stood from 1978 until 2008 when Lee Benson, another Vaqueros&#x27; player, surpassed it on May 3, 2008.

Throughout his career, Rodríguez remained loyal to the Vaqueros, leading them to nine national championship victories, including a streak of five consecutive wins from 1971 to 1975, as well as triumphs in 1967, 1969, 1981, and 1988. His contributions were recognized with the MVP award in 1979. The 1980 season, which marked the introduction of the three-point shot in the Puerto Rican tournament, saw Rodríguez adapt his game, scoring from behind the new three-point line.

The Vaqueros named their home venue after him, the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum, which was inaugurated in 1988.

<doc id="212336" wikidata="Q16985422" url="?curid=212336" title="Mesodma">
<text>Mesodma is an extinct genus of mammal, a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta, family Neoplagiaulacidae. It lived during the upper Cretaceous and Paleocene Periods of what is now North America. The earliest definitive record is from the late Santonian stage strata of the Straight Cliffs Formation. A single premolar tooth from the lower Cenomanian stage strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation has been tentatively assigned to this genus based on its similarity, but its describers noted that it is unlikely that &quot;Mesodma&quot; lived during that time.

==Species==
*Mesodma ambigua
**Place: Mantua Lentil, Wyoming (USA)
**Age: Maastrichtian-Puercan, Upper Cretaceous - Paleocene
**Weight: about 55 g
*Mesodma formosa
**Place: Hell Creek and Frenchman Formation, USA &amp; Canada. This species is possibly also known from Utah.
**Age: Maastrichtian-Puercan (Upper Cretaceous to the Paleocene). 
**Weight: about 30 g
*Mesodma hensleighi
**Place: Hell Creek Formation in the U.S. and in Saskatchewan, Canada. 
**Age: Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous). 
**Weight: around 15 g
*Mesodma pygmaea
**Place: Gidley Quarry, Montana, as well as Wyoming and Alberta, Canada
**Age: Torrejonian-Tiffanian (Middle Paleocene). 
**Weight: about 8 g
*Mesodma senecta
**Age: Campanian (Upper Cretaceous)
**Weight: about 50 g
*Mesodma thompsoni (=&quot;M. garfieldensis&quot;)
**Place: St Mary River Formation &amp; Montana and Wyoming of the US and Canada
**Age: Maastrichtian-Puercan, Upper Cretaceous - Paleocene
**Weight: about 55 g

The species &quot;&quot;Mesodma&quot; primaeva&quot; from the Judithian of Western Interior of North America was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Mesodma&quot;, but subsequently it was made the type species of a separate genus &quot;Filikomys&quot;.

<text>The history of the tank includes all vehicles intended to advance under enemy fire while remaining protected.

== Beginning ==
The principle of armored warfare can be compared with attempts to protect soldiers from enemy projectiles that existed since ancient times.

== Industrial revolution ==
The development of the explosion engine makes it possible to transport an armored vehicle more easily than with horses. One of the first traces of the use of an armored motor vehicle occurred during the Crimean War.

== Development ==
World War I generated new demands for armoured self-propelled weapons which could navigate any kind of terrain, and this led to the development of the tank. The great weakness of the tank predecessor, the armoured car, was that it required smooth terrain to move upon, and new developments were needed for cross-country capability.

The tank was originally designed as a special weapon to solve an unusual tactical situation: the stalemate of the trenches on the Western Front. &quot;It was a weapon designed for one simple task: crossing the killing zone between trench lines and breaking into enemy [defences].&quot; The armoured tank was intended to be able to protect against bullets and shell splinters, and pass through barbed wire in a way infantry units could not hope to, thus allowing the stalemate to be broken.

Few recognised during World War I that the means for returning mobility and shock action to combat was already present in a device destined to revolutionise warfare on the ground and in the air. This was the internal combustion engine, which had made possible the development of the tank and eventually would lead to the mechanised forces that were to assume the old roles of horse cavalry and to loosen the grip of the machine-gun on the battlefield.

With increased firepower and protection, these mechanised forces would, only some 20 years later, become the armour of World War II. When self-propelled artillery, the armoured personnel carrier, the wheeled cargo vehicle, and supporting aviation—all with adequate communications—were combined to constitute the modern armoured division, commanders regained the capability of manoeuvre.

Numerous concepts of armoured all-terrain vehicles had been imagined for a long time. With the advent of trench warfare in World War I, the Allied French and British developments of the tank were largely parallel and coincided in time.

===Early concepts===
Leonardo da Vinci is often credited with the invention of a war machine that resembled a tank. In the 15th century, a Hussite called Jan Žižka won several battles using armoured wagons containing cannons that could be fired through holes in their sides, but his invention was not used after his lifetime until the 20th century. In the 17th century, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz devised his &quot;fire cart&quot;, which incorporated the gunpowder engine for propulsion, anticipating the 20th-century incorporation of the internal combustion engine for the same purpose.

In 1903, a French artillery captain named Léon Levavasseur proposed the Levavasseur project, a &quot;canon autopropulseur&quot; (&quot;self-propelled cannon&quot;), moved by a caterpillar system and fully armoured for protection. Powered by an 80 hp petrol engine, &quot;the Levavasseur machine would have had a crew of three, storage for ammunition, and a cross-country ability&quot;, but the viability of the project was disputed by the Artillery Technical Committee, until it was formally abandoned in 1908 when it was known that a caterpillar tractor had been developed, the &quot;Hornsby&quot; of engineer David Roberts.

H. G. Wells, in his short story &quot;The Land Ironclads&quot;, published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1903, had described the use of large, armed, armoured cross-country vehicles equipped with pedrail wheels (an invention which he acknowledged as the source for his inspiration), to break through a system of fortified trenches, disrupting the defence and clearing the way for an infantry advance:
In the years before the Great War, two practical tank-like designs were proposed but not developed. In 1911, the Austrian engineering officer Günther Burstyn submitted a proposal for a fighting vehicle that had a gun in a rotating turret, known as the Motorgeschütz. In 1912, the Australian civil engineer Lancelot de Mole&#x27;s proposal included a scale model of a functional fully tracked vehicle. Both of these were rejected by their respective governmental administrations.

===American tracked tractors in Europe===
Benjamin Holt of the Holt Manufacturing Company of Stockton, California was the first to file a US patent for a workable crawler type tractor in 1907. The centre of such innovation was in England, and in 1903 he travelled to England to learn more about ongoing development, though all those he saw failed their field tests. Holt paid Alvin Orlando Lombard for the right to produce vehicles under Lombard&#x27;s patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler.

Holt returned to Stockton and, utilizing his knowledge and his company&#x27;s metallurgical capabilities, he became the first to design and manufacture practical continuous tracks for use in tractors. In England, David Roberts of Hornsby &amp; Sons, Grantham, obtained a patent for a design in July 1904. In the United States, Holt replaced the wheels on a Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine ploughing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island.

When World War I broke out, with the problem of trench warfare and the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front, the pulling power of crawling-type tractors drew the attention of the military. Holt tractors were used to replace horses to haul artillery and other supplies. The Royal Army Service Corps also used them to haul long trains of freight wagons over the unimproved dirt tracks behind the front. Holt tractors were, ultimately, the inspiration for the development of the British and French tanks.

By 1916, about 1,000 of Holt&#x27;s Caterpillar tractors were used by the British in World War I. Speaking to the press, in claiming the British tanks in use in 1916 were Holt-built, Holt vice president Murray M. Baker said that these tractors weighed about and had . By the end of the war, 10,000 Holt vehicles had been used in the Allied war effort.

===French===


The French colonel Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne articulated the vision of a cross-country armoured vehicle on 24 August 1914:

Some privately owned Holt tractors were used by the French Army soon after the start of World War I to pull heavy artillery pieces in difficult terrain, but the French did not purchase Holts in large numbers. It was the sight of them in use by the British that later inspired Estienne to have plans drawn up for an armoured body on caterpillar tracks. In the meantime, several attempts were made to design vehicles that could overcome the German barbed wire and trenches.

From 1914 to 1915, an early experiment was made with the Boirault machine, with the objective of flattening barbed wire defences and riding over gaps in a battlefield. The machine was made of huge parallel tracks, formed by 4×3 metre metallic frames, rotating around a triangular motorized centre. This device proved too fragile and slow, as well as incapable of changing direction easily, and was abandoned.

In France, on 1 December 1914, Paul Frot, an engineer constructing canals for the &quot;Compagnie Nationale du Nord&quot;, proposed to the French Ministry a design for a &quot;landship&quot; with armour and armament based on the motorisation of a compactor with heavy wheels or rollers. The Frot-Laffly was tested on 18 March 1915, and effectively destroyed barbed wire lines, but was deemed lacking in mobility. The project was abandoned in favour of General Estienne&#x27;s development using a tractor base, codenamed &quot;Tracteur Estienne&quot;.

In 1915, attempts were also made to develop vehicles with powerful armour and armament, mounted on the cross-country chassis of agricultural tractors, with large wheels having coarse treads, such as the Aubriot-Gabet &quot;Fortress&quot; (&quot;Fortin Aubriot-Gabet&quot;). The vehicle was powered by electricity (complete with a supply cable), and armed with a Navy cannon of 37mm, but it too proved impractical.

In January 1915, the French arms manufacturer Schneider &amp; Co. sent out its chief designer, Eugène Brillié, to investigate tracked tractors from the American Holt Manufacturing Company, at that time participating in a test programme in England, for a project of mechanical wire-cutting machines. On his return Brillié, who had earlier been involved in designing armoured cars for Spain, convinced the company management to initiate studies on the development of a &quot;Tracteur blindé et armé&quot; (armoured and armed tractor), based on the &quot;Baby Holt&quot; chassis, two of which were ordered.

Experiments on the Holt caterpillar tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75-hp wheel-directed model and the 45-hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. On 16 June, new experiments followed, which were witnessed by the President of the Republic, and on 10 September, by Commander Ferrus. The first complete chassis with armour was demonstrated at Souain on 9 December 1915, to the French Army, with the participation of Colonel Estienne.

On 12 December, unaware of the Schneider experiments, Estienne presented to the High Command a plan to form an armoured force, equipped with tracked vehicles. He was put in touch with Schneider, and in a letter dated 31 January 1916 Commander-in-chief Joffre ordered the production of 400 tanks of the type designed by Brillié and Estienne, although the actual production order of 400 Schneider CA1 was made a bit later on 25 February 1916. Soon after, on 8 April 1916, another order for 400 Saint-Chamond tanks was also placed. Schneider had trouble with meeting production schedules, and the tank deliveries were spread over several months from 8 September 1916. The Saint-Chamond tank would start being delivered from 27 April 1917.

===British===

In 1914, the British War Office ordered a Holt tractor and put it through trials at Aldershot. Although it was not as powerful as the Foster-Daimler tractor, the Holt was better suited to haul heavy loads over uneven ground. Without a load, the Holt tractor managed a walking pace of . Towing a load, it could manage . Most importantly, Holt tractors were readily available in quantity. The War Office was suitably impressed and chose it as a gun-tractor.

In July 1914, Lt. Col. Ernest Swinton, a British Royal Engineer officer, learned about Holt tractors and their transportation capabilities in rough terrain from a friend who had seen one in Antwerp, but passed the information on to the transport department. When the First World War broke out, Swinton was sent to France as the Army&#x27;s war correspondent and in October 1914 identified the need for what he described as a &quot;machine-gun destroyer&quot;—a cross-country, armed vehicle. He remembered the Holt tractor, and decided that it could be the basis for an armoured vehicle.

Swinton proposed in a letter to Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the British Committee of Imperial Defence, that the Committee build a power-driven, bullet-proof, tracked vehicle that could destroy enemy guns. Hankey persuaded the War Office—which was lukewarm to the idea—to make a trial on 17 February 1915 with a Holt tractor, but the caterpillar bogged down in the mud, the project was abandoned, and the War Office gave up investigations.

In May 1915, the War Office made new tests on a trench-crossing machine: the Tritton Trench-Crosser. The machine was equipped with large tractor wheels, in diameter, and carried girders on an endless chain which were lowered above a trench so that the back wheels could roll over it. The machine would then drag the girder behind until on flat terrain, so that it could reverse over them and set them back in place in front of the vehicle. The machine proved much too cumbersome and was abandoned.

When Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, learned of the armoured tractor idea, he reignited investigation of the idea of using the Holt tractor. The Royal Navy and the Landship Committee (established on 20 February 1915), at last agreed to sponsor experiments and tests of armoured tractors as a type of &quot;land ship&quot;. In March, Churchill ordered the building of 18 experimental landships: 12 using Diplock pedrails (an idea promoted by Murray Sueter), and six using large wheels (the idea of Thomas Gerard Hetherington). Construction however failed to move forward, as the wheels seemed impractical after a wooden mock-up was realized: the wheels were initially planned to be 40-feet in diameter, but turned out to be still too big and too fragile at 15-feet. The pedrails also met with industrial problems, and the system was deemed too large, too complicated and under-powered.

Instead of choosing to use the Holt tractor, the British government chose to involve a British agricultural machinery firm, Foster and Sons, whose managing director and designer was Sir William Tritton. 

After all these projects failed by June 1915, ideas of grandiose landships were abandoned, and a decision was taken to make an attempt with US &quot;Bullock Creeping Grip&quot; caterpillar tracks, by connecting two of them together to obtain an articulated chassis deemed necessary for manoeuvring. Experiments failed in tests made in July 1915.

Another experiment was conducted with an American Killen-Strait tracked tractor. A wire-cutting mechanism was successfully fitted, but the trench-crossing capability of the vehicle proved insufficient. A Delaunay-Belleville armoured car body was fitted, making the Killen-Strait Armoured Tractor the first armoured tracked vehicle, but the project was abandoned as it turned out to be a blind alley, unable to fulfil all-terrain warfare requirements.

After these experiments, the Committee decided to build a smaller experimental landship, equivalent to one half the articulated version, and using lengthened US-made &quot;Bullock Creeping Grip&quot; caterpillar tracks. This new experimental machine was called the &quot;No1 Lincoln Machine&quot;: construction started on 11 August 1915, with the first trials starting on 10 September 1915. These trials failed however because of unsatisfactory tracks.

Development continued with new, re-engineered tracks designed by William Tritton, and the machine, now renamed &quot;Little Willie&quot;, was completed in December 1915 and tested on 3 December 1915. Trench-crossing ability was deemed insufficient however, and Walter Gordon Wilson developed a rhomboidal design, which became known as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Landship &quot;Centipede&quot;&quot; and later &quot;Mother&quot;, the first of the &quot;Big Willie&quot; types of true tanks. After completion on 29 January 1916 very successful trials were made, and an order was placed by the War Office for 100 units to be used on the Western front in France, on 12 February 1916, and a second order for 50 additional units was placed in April 1916.

France started studying caterpillar continuous tracks from January 1915, and actual tests started in May 1915, two months earlier than the &quot;Little Willie&quot; experiments. At the Souain experiment, France tested an armoured tracked tank prototype, the same month &quot;Little Willie&quot; was completed. Ultimately however, the British were the first to put tanks on the battlefield, at the Battle of the Somme in September 1916.

===Origin of the tank name===

The name &quot;tank&quot; was introduced in December, 1915 as a security measure and has been adopted in many languages. William Tritton, stated that when the prototypes were under construction from August, 1915 they were deliberately falsely described in order to conceal their true purpose. In the workshop the paperwork described them as &quot;water carriers,&quot; supposedly for use on the Mesopotamian Front. In conversation the workers referred to them as &quot;water tanks&quot; or, simply, &quot;tanks.&quot; In October the Landships Committee decided, for security purposes, to change its own name to something less descriptive.

One of the members, Ernest Swinton suggested &quot;tank,&quot; and the committee agreed. The name &quot;tank&quot; was used in official documents and common parlance from then on, and the Landships Committee was renamed the Tank Supply Committee. This is sometimes confused with the labelling of the first production tanks (ordered in February, 1916) with a caption in Russian. It translated as &quot;With Care to Petrograd,&quot; probably again inspired by the workers at Foster&#x27;s, some of whom believed the machines to be snowploughs meant for Russia, and was introduced from May 15, 1916. The committee was happy to perpetuate this misconception since it might also mislead the Germans.

The naval background of the tank&#x27;s development also explains such nautical tank terms as hatch, hull, bow, and ports. The great secrecy surrounding tank development, coupled with the scepticism of infantry commanders, often meant that infantry at first had little training to cooperate with tanks.

===Russian===


Vasily Mendeleev, an engineer in a shipyard, worked privately on the design of the super-heavy Mendeleev tank from 1911 to 1915. It was a heavily armoured 170 ton tracked vehicle armed with one 120 mm naval gun. The design envisioned many innovations that became standard features of a modern battle tank—protection of the vehicle was well-thought out, the gun included automatic loading mechanism, pneumatic suspension allowed adjusting of clearance, some critical systems were duplicated, transportation by railroad was possible by a locomotive or with adapter wheels. However, the cost would have been almost as much as that of a submarine, and it was never built.

The Vezdekhod was a small cross-country vehicle designed by aero-engineer Aleksandr Porokhovschikov that ran on a single wide rubber track propelled by a 10 hp engine. Two small wheels on either side were provided for steering but while the vehicles could cross ground well its steering was ineffectual. In post-revolution Russia, the Vezdekhod was portrayed in propaganda as the first tank.

The Tsar Tank, also known as the Lebedenko tank after its designer, was a tricycle design vehicle on 9 m high front wheels. It was expected that such large wheels would be able to cross any obstacle but because of a flawed design most of the weight was forced through the smaller rear wheel, which became stuck when tested in 1915. The designers were prepared to fit larger engines but the project—and the vehicle—was abandoned.

===German===
The A7V was the only German tank of World War I that saw actual combat. A prototype was built in early 1917 for trials, with production of the vehicles beginning in October of the same year. They were used on about six occasions from March 1918. Only twenty were produced. Germany also had several other projects on paper as well as other prototype tanks in development.

==Operational use==
===World War I===


The first offensive using tanks took place on 15 September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. Forty-nine of the Mark I type were committed, of which thirty-two were mechanically fit to take part in the advance and achieved some small, local successes. In July 1917, 216 British tanks were employed in the Third Battle of Ypres but found it almost impossible to operate in the muddy conditions and achieved little. Not until 20 November 1917, at Cambrai, did the British Tank Corps get the conditions it needed for success. Over 400 tanks penetrated almost 6 miles on a 7-mile wide front.

However, success was not complete because the infantry failed to exploit and secure the tanks&#x27; gains, and almost all the territory gained was recaptured by the Germans. The Australian, Canadian, and British forces then scored a far more significant victory the following year, on 8 August 1918, with 600 tanks in the Battle of Amiens. General Erich Ludendorff referred to that date as the &quot;Black Day&quot; of the German Army.

Parallel to the British development, France designed its own tanks. The first two, the medium Schneider CA and heavy Saint-Chamond, were not well-conceived, though produced in large numbers and showing technical innovations, the latter using an electro-mechanical transmission and a long 75 mm gun. Both types saw action on numerous occasions but suffered consistently high losses. In 1918, the Renault FT light tank was the first tank in history with a &quot;modern&quot; configuration: a revolving turret on top and an engine compartment at the rear; it would be the most numerous tank of the war. A last development was the superheavy Char 2C, the largest tank ever to see service, some years after the armistice.

The German response to the Cambrai assault was to develop its own armoured program. Soon the massive A7V appeared, weighing 30 tons and with a crew of eighteen. By the end of the war, only twenty had been built. Although other tanks were on the drawing board, material shortages limited the German tank corps to these A7Vs and about 36 captured Mark IVs. The A7V would be involved in the first tank &quot;vs&quot;. tank battle of the war on April 24, 1918, at the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux—a battle in which there was no clear winner.

Numerous mechanical failures and the inability of the British and French to mount any sustained drives in the early tank actions cast doubt on their usefulness—and by 1918, tanks were extremely vulnerable unless accompanied by infantry and ground-attack aircraft, both of which worked to locate and suppress anti-tank defences.

General John J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), requested in September 1917 that 600 heavy and 1,200 light tanks be produced in the United States. When Pershing assumed command of the AEF and went to France, he took Lt. Col. George Patton, who became interested in tanks. They were then unwieldy, unreliable, and unproven instruments of warfare, and there was much doubt whether they had any function and value at all on the battlefield. Against the advice of most of his friends, Patton chose to go into the newly formed US Tank Corps. He was the first officer so assigned.

The first American-produced heavy tank was the 43.5-ton Mark VIII (sometimes known as the &quot;Liberty&quot;), a US–British development of the successful British heavy tank design, intended to equip the Allied forces. Armed with two 6-pounder cannons and five rifle-caliber machine guns, it was operated by an 11-man crew, and had a maximum speed of 6.5 miles per hour and a range of 50 miles. Because of production difficulties, only test vehicles were completed before the War ended.

The American-built 6.5-ton M1917 light tank was a close copy of the French Renault FT. It had a maximum speed of 5.5 miles per hour and could travel 30 miles on its 30-gallon fuel capacity. Again, because of production delays, none were completed in time to see action. In the summer of 1918 a 3-ton, 2-man tank, (Ford 3-Ton M1918) originated by the Ford Motor Company was designed. It was powered by two Ford Model T, 4-cylinder engines, armed with a .30 inch machine gun, and had a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour. It was considered unsatisfactory as a fighting vehicle but to have possible value in other battlefield roles. An order was placed for 15,000, but only 15 were completed, and none saw service in the War.

American tank units first entered combat on 12 September 1918 against the Saint-Mihiel salient with the First Army. They belonged to the 344th and 345th Light Tank Battalions, elements of the 304th Tank Brigade, commanded by Lt. Col. Patton, under whom they had trained at the tank center in Bourg, France, and were equipped with the Renault FT, supplied by France. Although mud, lack of fuel, and mechanical failure caused many tanks to stall in the German trenches, the attack succeeded and much valuable experience was gained. By the armistice of 11 November 1918, the AEF was critically short on tanks, as no American-made ones were completed in time for use in combat.

=== Interwar period ===


After World War I, General Erich Ludendorff of the German High Command praised the Allied tanks as being a principal factor in Germany&#x27;s defeat. The Germans had been too late in recognizing their value to consider them in their own plans. Even if their already hard-pressed industry could have produced them in quantity, fuel was in very short supply. Of the total of 90 tanks fielded by the Germans during 1918, 75 had been captured from the Allies.

The U.S. tank units fought so briefly and were so fragmented during the war, and the number of tanks available to them was so limited, that there was practically no opportunity to develop tactics for their large-scale employment. Nonetheless, their work was sufficiently impressive to imbue at least a few military leaders with the idea that the use of tanks in mass was the most likely principal role of armour in the future.

Highlights of U.S. Army appraisal for the development and use of tanks, developed from combat experience, were: (1) the need for a tank with more power, fewer mechanical failures, heavier armour, longer operating range, and better ventilation; (2) the need for combined training of tanks with other combat arms, especially the infantry; (3) the need for improved means of communication and of methods for determining and maintaining directions; and (4) the need for an improved supply system, especially for petrol and ammunition.

At the war&#x27;s end, the main role of the tank was considered to be that of close support for the infantry. Although the tank of World War I was slow, clumsy, unwieldy, difficult to control, and mechanically unreliable, its value as a combat weapon had been clearly proven. But, despite the lessons of World War I, the combat arms were most reluctant to accept a separate and independent role for armor and continued to struggle among themselves over the proper use of tanks. At the outset, thought of the tank as an auxiliary to and a part of the infantry was the predominant opinion, although a few leaders contended that an independent tank arm should be retained.

In addition to the light and heavy categories of American-produced tanks of World War I, a third classification, the medium, began receiving attention in 1919. It was hoped that this in-between type would incorporate the best features of the 6-ton light and the Mark VIII heavy and would replace both. The meaning of the terms light, medium, and heavy tanks changed between the wars. During World War I and immediately thereafter, the light tank was considered to be up to 10 tons, the medium (produced by the British) was roughly between 10 and 25 tons, and the heavy was over 25 tons. For World War II, increased weights resulted in the light tank being over 20 tons, the medium over 30, and the heavy, developed toward the end of the war, over 60 tons. During the period between the world wars, the weights of the classifications varied generally within these extremes.

The U.S. National Defense Act of 1920 placed the Tank Corps under the Infantry. The Act&#x27;s stipulation that &quot;hereafter all tank units shall form a part of the Infantry&quot; left little doubt as to the tank role for the immediate future. George Patton had argued for an independent Tank Corps. But if, in the interest of economy, the tanks had to go under one of the traditional arms, he preferred the cavalry, for Patton intuitively understood that tanks operating with cavalry would stress mobility, while tanks tied to the infantry would emphasize firepower. Tanks in peacetime, he feared, as he said, &quot;would be very much like coast artillery with a lot of machinery which never works.&quot;

At a time when most soldiers regarded the tank as a specialized infantry-support weapon for crossing trenches, a significant number of officers in the Royal Tank Corps had gone on to envision much broader roles for mechanized organizations. In May 1918, Col. J.F.C. Fuller, the acknowledged father of tank doctrine, had used the example of German infiltration tactics to refine what he called &quot;Plan 1919&quot;. This was an elaborate concept for a large-scale armoured offensive in 1919.

The Royal Tank Corps had to make do with the same basic tanks from 1922 until 1938. British armoured theorists did not always agree with each other. B. H. Liddell Hart, a noted publicist of armoured warfare, wanted a true combined arms force with a major role for mechanized infantry. Fuller, Broad, and other officers were more interested in a pure-tank role. 
The Experimental Mechanized Force formed by the British under Percy Hobart to investigate and develop techniques was a mobile force with its own self-propelled guns, supporting infantry and engineers in motor vehicles and armoured cars.

Both advocates and opponents of mechanization often used the term &quot;tank&quot; loosely to mean not only an armored, tracked, turreted, gun-carrying fighting vehicle, but also any form of armored vehicle or mechanized unit. Such usage made it difficult for contemporaries or historians to determine whether a particular speaker was discussing pure tank forces, mechanized combined arms forces, or mechanization of infantry forces.

British armoured vehicles tended to maximize either mobility or protection. Both the cavalry and the Royal Tank Corps wanted fast, lightly armoured, mobile vehicles for reconnaissance and raiding—the light and medium (or &quot;cruiser&quot;) tanks. In practice the &quot;light tanks&quot; were often small armoured personnel carriers. On the other hand, the &quot;army tank battalions&quot; performing the traditional infantry-support role required extremely heavy armoured protection. As a consequence of these two doctrinal roles, firepower was neglected in tank design.

Among the German proponents of mechanization, General Heinz Guderian was probably the most influential. Guderian&#x27;s 1914 service with radiotelegraphs in support of cavalry units led him to insist on a radio in every armoured vehicle. By 1929, when many British students of armour were tending towards a pure armour formation, Guderian had become convinced that it was useless to develop just tanks, or even to mechanize parts of the traditional arms. What was needed was an entirely new mechanized formation of all arms that would maximize the effects of the tank.

The German tanks were not up to the standards of Guderian&#x27;s concept. The Panzer I was really a machine-gun-armed tankette, derived from the British Carden Loyd tankette. The Panzer II did have a 20-mm cannon, but little armour protection. These two vehicles made up the bulk of panzer units until 1940.

In the twenties France was the only country in the world with a large armour force. French doctrine viewed combined arms as a process by which all other weapons systems assisted the infantry in its forward progress. Tanks were considered to be &quot;a sort of armoured infantry&quot;, by law subordinated to the infantry branch. This at least had the advantage that armour was not restricted purely to tanks; the French army would be among the most mechanised.

Tanks proper were however first of all seen as specialised breakthrough systems, to be concentrated for an offensive: light tanks had to limit their speed to that of the foot soldier; heavy tanks were intended to form a forward &quot;shock front&quot; to dislodge defensive lines. The doctrine was much preoccupied with the strength of the defender: artillery and air bombardments had to destroy machine guns and anti-tank guns. The envelopment phase was neglected. Though part of the Infantry branch, tanks were in fact concentrated in almost pure tank units and rarely trained together with foot soldiers.

In 1931, France decided to produce armour and other equipment in larger quantities, including the Char B1 &quot;bis&quot;. The B1 bis, developed by Estienne in the early 1920s, was still one of the most powerful tank designs in the world fifteen years later. In 1934 the French cavalry also began a process of mechanisation; tanks were to be used for exploitation also.

As the French Army was moving forward in the area of mechanization, doctrinal strife began to develop. In 1934, Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Gaulle published &quot;Towards the Professional Army&quot; (&quot;Vers l&#x27;Armée de Métier&quot;). De Gaulle favoured a professional mechanised force, capable of executing both the breakthrough and the exploitation phase. He envisioned a pure armour brigade operating in linear formation, followed by a motorized infantry force for mopping-up. His ideas were not adopted, as being too expensive.

From 1936 French tank production accelerated, but the doctrinal problems remained, resulting in 1940 in an inflexible structure, with the Infantry and Cavalry fielding separate types of armoured division.

During the course of the 1920s and early 1930s, a group of Soviet officers led by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky developed a concept of &quot;Deep Battle&quot; to employ conventional infantry and cavalry divisions, mechanized formations, and aviation in concert. Using the expanded production facilities of the Soviet government&#x27;s first Five Year Plan with design features taken in part from the American inventor J. Walter Christie, the Soviets produced 5,000 armoured vehicles by 1934. This wealth of equipment enabled the Red Army to create tank organizations for both infantry support and combined arms, mechanized operations.

On 12 June 1937, the Soviet government executed Tukhachevsky and eight of his high-ranking officers, as Stalin shifted his purge of Soviet society against the last power group that had the potential to threaten him, the Red Army. At the same time, the Soviet experience in the Spanish Civil War caused the Red Army to reassess mechanization. The Soviet tanks were too lightly armoured, their Russian crews could not communicate with the Spanish troops, and in combat the tanks tended to outpace the supporting infantry and artillery.

The United States was not nearly so advanced in the development of armoured and mechanized forces. As in France, the supply of slow World War I tanks and the subordination of tanks to the infantry branch impeded the development of any role other than direct infantry support. The US War Department policy statement, which finally came in April 1922, was a serious blow to tank development. Reflecting prevailing opinion, it stated that the tank&#x27;s primary mission was &quot;to facilitate the uninterrupted advance of the riflemen in the attack.&quot;

The War Department considered that two types of tanks, the light and the medium, should fulfill all missions. The light tank was to be truck transportable and not exceed 5 tons gross weight. For the medium, restrictions were even tighter; its weight was not to exceed 15 tons, so as to bring it within the weight capacity of railroad flatcars, the average existing highway bridge, and, most significantly, available Engineer Corps pontoon bridges.

Although an experimental 15-ton tank, the M1924, reached the mock-up stage, this and other attempts to satisfy War Department and infantry specifications proved to be unsatisfactory. In reality it was simply impossible to build a 15-ton vehicle meeting both War Department and infantry requirements.

In 1926 the General Staff reluctantly consented to the development of a 23-ton tank, although it made clear that efforts were to continue toward the production of a satisfactory 15-ton vehicle. The infantry—its new branch chief overriding the protests of some of his tankmen who wanted a more heavily armed and armored medium—decided, too, that a light tank, transportable by truck, best met infantry requirements. The net effect of the infantry&#x27;s preoccupation with light tanks and the limited funds available for tank development in general was to slow the development of heavier vehicles and, ultimately, to contribute to the serious shortage of mediums at the outbreak of World War II.

J. Walter Christie was an innovative designer of tanks, engines and propulsion systems. Although his designs did not meet US Army specifications, other countries used his chassis patents. Despite inadequate funding, the Ordnance Department managed to develop several experimental light and medium tanks and tested one of Walter Christie&#x27;s models by 1929. None of these tanks was accepted, usually because each of them exceeded standards set by other Army branches.

For instance, several light tank models were rejected because they exceeded the 5-ton cargo capacity of the Transportation Corps trucks, and several medium tank designs were rejected because they exceeded the 15-ton bridge weight limit set by the engineers. Christie simply would not work with users to fulfill the military requirements but, instead, wanted the Army to fund the tanks that he wanted to build.

The Christie tank embodied the ability to operate both on tracks and on large, solid-rubber-tired bogie wheels. The tracks were removable to permit operation on wheels over moderate terrain. Also featured was a suspension system of independently sprung wheels. The Christie had many advantages, including the amazing ability, in 1929, to attain speeds of 69 miles per hour on wheels and 42 miles per hour on tracks, although at these speeds the tank could not carry full equipment.

The Ordnance Department, while recognizing the usefulness of the Christie, was of the opinion that it was mechanically unreliable and that such dual-purpose equipment generally violated good engineering practice. The controversy over the advantages and drawbacks of Christie tanks raged for more than twenty years, with the convertible principle being abandoned in 1938. But the Christie ideas had great impact upon tank tactics and unit organization in many countries and, finally, upon the US Army as well.

In the United States the real beginning of the Armored Force was in 1928, twelve years before it was officially established, when Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis directed that a tank force be developed in the Army. Earlier that year he had been much impressed, as an observer of maneuvers in England, by a British experimental armoured Force. Actually the idea was not new. A small group of dedicated officers in the cavalry and the infantry had been hard at work since World War I on theories for such a force.

The continued progress in the design of armour, armament, engines, and vehicles was gradually swinging the trend toward more mechanization, and the military value of the horse declined. Proponents of mechanization and motorization pointed to advances in the motor vehicle industry and to the corresponding decrease in the use of horses and mules. Furthermore, abundant oil resources gave the United States an enviable position of independence in fuel requirements for the machines.

Secretary Davis&#x27; 1928 directive for the development of a tank force resulted in the assembly and encampment of an experimental mechanized force at Camp Meade, Maryland, from 1 July to 20 September 1928. The combined arms team consisted of elements furnished by Infantry (including tanks), Cavalry, Field Artillery, the Air Corps, Engineer Corps, Ordnance Department, Chemical Warfare Service, and Medical Corps. An effort to continue the experiment in 1929 was defeated by insufficient funds and obsolete equipment, but the 1928 exercise did bear fruit, for the War Department Mechanization Board, appointed to study results of the experiment, recommended the permanent establishment of a mechanized force.

As Chief of Staff from 1930 to 1935, Douglas MacArthur wanted to advance motorization and mechanization throughout the army. In late 1931 all arms and services were directed to adopt mechanization and motorization, &quot;as far as is practicable and desirable&quot;, and were permitted to conduct research and to experiment as necessary. Cavalry was given the task of developing combat vehicles that would &quot;enhance its power in roles of reconnaissance, counterreconnaissance, flank action, pursuit, and similar operations.&quot; By law, &quot;tanks&quot; belonged to the infantry branch, so the cavalry gradually bought a group of &quot;combat cars&quot;, lightly armoured and armed tanks that were often indistinguishable from the newer infantry &quot;tanks.&quot;

In 1933 MacArthur set the stage for the coming complete mechanization of the cavalry, declaring, &quot;The horse has no higher degree of mobility today than he had a thousand years ago. The time has therefore arrived when the Cavalry arm must either replace or assist the horse as a means of transportation, or else pass into the limbo of discarded military formations.&quot; Although the horse was not yet claimed to be obsolete, his competition was gaining rapidly, and realistic cavalrymen, sensing possible extinction, looked to at least partial substitution of the faster machines for horses in cavalry units.

The War Department in 1938 modified its 1931 directive for all arms and services to adopt mechanization and motorization. Thereafter, development of mechanization was to be accomplished by two of the combat arms only—the cavalry and the infantry. As late as 1938, on the other hand, the Chief of Cavalry, Maj. Gen. John K. Herr, proclaimed, &quot;We must not be misled to our own detriment to assume that the untried machine can displace the proved and tried horse.&quot; He favored a balanced force made up of both horse and mechanized cavalry. In testimony before a Congressional committee in 1939, Maj. Gen. John K. Herr maintained that horse cavalry had &quot;stood the acid test of war&quot;, whereas the motor elements advocated by some to replace it had not.

Overall, between the world wars, while there was much theoretical there was little tangible progress in tank production and tank tactics in the United States. Production was limited to a few hand-tooled test models, only thirty-five of which were built between 1920 and 1935. Regarding the use of tanks with infantry, the official doctrine of 1939 largely reiterated that of 1923. It maintained that &quot;As a rule, tanks are employed to assist the advance of infantry foot troops, either preceding or accompanying the infantry assault echelon.&quot;

In the 1930s the American Army began to seriously discuss the integration of the tank and the airplane into existing doctrine, but the US Army remained an infantry-centered Army, even though sufficient changes had occurred to warrant serious study. In the spring of 1940, maneuvers in Georgia and Louisiana, where Patton was an umpire, showed how far U.S. Army General Adna R. Chaffee Jr. had brought the development of American armoured doctrine.

=== World War II ===


World War II forced armies to integrate all the available arms at every level into a mobile, flexible team. The mechanized combined arms force came of age in this war. In 1939, most armies still thought of an armoured division as a mass of tanks with relatively limited support from the other arms. By 1943, the same armies had evolved armoured divisions that were a balance of different arms and services, each of which had to be as mobile and almost as protected as the tanks they accompanied. This concentration of mechanized forces in a small number of mobile divisions left the ordinary infantry unit deficient in armour to accompany the deliberate attack. The German, Soviet, and American armies therefore developed a number of tank surrogates such as tank destroyers and assault guns to perform these functions in cooperation with the infantry.

Armour experts in most armies, however, were determined to avoid being tied to the infantry, and in any event a tank was an extremely complicated, expensive, and therefore scarce weapon. The British persisted for much of the war on a dual track of development, retaining Infantry tanks to support the infantry and lighter, more mobile cruiser tanks for independent armoured formations. The Soviets similarly produced an entire series of heavy breakthrough tanks.

During the war, German tank design went through at least three generations, plus constant minor variations. The first generation included such prewar vehicles as the Panzerkampfwagen (or Panzer) I and II, which were similar to Soviet and British light tanks. The Germans converted their tank battalions to a majority of Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks after the 1940 French campaign. The appearance of large numbers of the new generation T-34 and KV-1 Soviet tanks, that were unknown to Germans until 1941, compelled them to join a race for superior armour and gun power.

The third generation included many different variants, but the most important designs were the Panther (Panzer V) and Tiger (Panzer VI) tanks. Unfortunately for the Germans, lack of resources combined with emphasis on protection and firepower and a penchant for overly complex design philosophies in nearly every part of an armoured fighting vehicle&#x27;s design compromised the production numbers. However, an assault gun casemate-hulled development of the Panzer III, the Sturmgeschütz III, would turn out to be Germany&#x27;s most-produced armoured fighting vehicle of any type during the war, at just over 9,300 examples, a popular design which could also be very effectively tasked to perform the duties of a dedicated anti-tank vehicle.

When Germany invaded western Europe in 1940, the US Army had only 28 new tanks—18 medium and 10 light—and these were soon to become obsolete, along with some 900 older models on hand. The Army had no heavy tanks and no immediate plans for any. Even more serious than the shortage of tanks was industry&#x27;s lack of experience in tank manufacture and limited production facilities. Furthermore, the United States was committed to helping supply its allies. By 1942 American tank production had soared to just under 25,000, almost doubling the combined British and German output for that year. And in 1943, the peak tank production year, the total was 29,497. All in all, from 1940 through 1945, US tank production totaled 88,410.

Tank designs of World War II were based upon many complex considerations, but the principal factors were those thought to be best supported by combat experience. Among these, early combat proved that a bigger tank was not necessarily a better tank. The development goal came to be a tank combining all the proven characteristics in proper balance, to which weight and size were only incidentally related. The key characteristics were mechanical reliability, firepower, mobility and protection.

The problem here was that only a slight addition to the thickness of armour plate greatly increased the total weight of the tank, thereby requiring a more powerful and heavier engine. This, in turn, resulted in a larger and heavier transmission and suspension system. Just this sort of &quot;vicious circle&quot; aimed at upgrading a tank&#x27;s most vital characteristics tended to make the tank less maneuverable, slower, and a larger and easier target. Determining the point at which the optimum thickness of armour was reached, in balance with other factors, presented a challenge that resulted in numerous proposed solutions and much disagreement.

According to Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, Chief of Staff of GHQ, and later Commanding General, Army Ground Forces, the answer to bigger enemy tanks was more powerful guns instead of increased size.

Since emphasis of the using arms was upon light tanks during 1940 and 1941, their production at first was almost two to one over the mediums. But in 1943, as the demand grew for more powerful tanks, the lights fell behind, and by 1945 the number of light tanks produced was less than half the number of mediums.

In 1945–46, the General Board of the US European Theater of Operations conducted an exhaustive review of past and future organization. The tank destroyer was deemed too specialized to justify in a peacetime force structure. In a reversal of previous doctrine, the US Army concluded that &quot;the medium tank is the best antitank weapon.&quot; Although such a statement may have been true, it ignored the difficulties of designing a tank that could outshoot and defeat all other tanks.

=== Cold War ===


In the Cold War, the two opposing forces in Europe were the Warsaw Pact countries on the one side, and the NATO countries on the other side.

Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a few tank designs. In comparison, the major contributors to NATO, France, Germany, the US, and the UK developed their own tank designs, with little in common.

After World War II, tank development continued. Tanks would not only continue to be produced in huge numbers, but the technology advanced dramatically as well. Medium tanks became heavier, their armour became thicker and their firepower increased. This led gradually to the concept of the main battle tank and the gradual elimination of the heavy tank. Aspects of gun technology changed significantly as well, with advances in shell design and effectiveness.

Many of the changes in tank design have been refinements to targeting and ranging (fire control), gun stabilization, communications and crew comfort. Armour evolved to keep pace with improvements in weaponry—the rise of composite armour is of particular note—and guns grew more powerful. However, basic tank architecture did not change significantly, and has remained largely the same into the 21st century.

===Post-Cold War===

With the end of the Cold War in 1991, questions once again started sprouting concerning the relevance of the traditional tank. Over the years, many nations cut back the number of their tanks or replaced most of them with lightweight armoured fighting vehicles with only minimal armour protection.

This period also brought an end to the superpower blocs, and the military industries of Russia and Ukraine are now vying to sell tanks worldwide. India and Pakistan have upgraded old tanks and bought new T-84s and T-90s from the former Soviet states. Both have demonstrated prototypes that the respective countries are not adopting for their own use, but are designed exclusively to compete with the latest western offerings on the open market.

Ukraine has developed the T-84-120 &quot;Oplot&quot;, which can fire both NATO 120 mm ammunition and ATGMs through the gun barrel. It has a new turret with auto-loader, but imitates western designs with an armoured ammunition compartment to improve crew survivability.

The Russian &quot;Chyorny Oryol&quot; (&quot;Black Eagle&quot;) is based on a lengthened T-80 hull. An early mock-up, shown for the first time at the second VTTV-Omsk-97 International Exhibition of Armaments in 1997, appears to have dramatically heavier armour, and a completely new modern turret separating crew and ammunition. The prototype has a 125 mm tank gun, but is said to be able to mount a new 152 mm gun. Russia is also rumoured to be developing the Obiekt 775 MBT, sometimes called T-95, with a remote-controlled turret, for domestic service.

The Italian C1 Ariete MBT was among the latest all-new MBTs to be fielded, with deliveries running from 1995 to 2002. The tank is nearly the same size of the very first tank, both being 8 feet (2.5 m) high. The Mark I had a ~9.9 m long (hull) and the Ariete as a 7.6/9.52 m long (hull/hull+gun). However, the Ariete weighs over double and can travel ten times faster, 54,000 kg vs. 25,401 kg and 40 mph vs. 4 mph (60 v 6 km/h).

A number of armies have considered eliminating tanks completely, reverting to a mix of wheeled anti-tank guns and infantry fighting vehicles (IFV), though in general there is a great deal of resistance because all of the great powers still maintain large numbers of them, in active forces or in ready reserve. There has been no proven alternative, and tanks have had a relatively good track record in recent conflicts.

The tank continues to be vulnerable to many kinds of anti-tank weapons and is more logistically demanding than lighter vehicles, but these were traits that were true for the first tanks as well. In direct fire combat they offer an unmatched combination of higher survivability and firepower among ground-based warfare systems. Whether this combination is particularly useful in proportion to their cost is matter of debate, as there also exist very effective anti-tank systems, IFVs, and competition from air-based ground attack systems.

Due to vulnerability from RPGs, the tank has always had local defense from machine guns to solve the problem. This partially solved the problem in some cases, but produced another. Because the machine gun had to be operated by the commander from outside the tank, it made him vulnerable to enemy fire. To solve this problem, gun shields were made to reduce this threat, but did not completely solve the problem. So, when the development of the M1A2 TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit) came, the finalization of a remote machine gun came into place, and was one of the first main battle tanks to have one. Other examples of this gun have been seen, such as a 20 mm remote cannon on the M60A2. This remote machine gun, under the name CROWS (Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station) has solved the problem of enemy fire threat to the commander, when operating the machine gun. It can also be equipped with an optional grenade launcher.

Possibly one of the main evolution sources for tanks in this century are the active protection systems. Until 15 years ago, armour (reactive or passive) was the only effective measure against anti-tank assets. The most recent active protection systems (including Israeli TROPHY and Iron Fist and Russian Arena) offer high survivability even against volleys of RPG and missiles. If these kinds of systems evolve further and are integrated in contemporary tank and armoured vehicle fleets, the armour-antitank equation will change completely; therefore, 21st century tanks would experience a total revival in terms of operational capabilities.

<text>Ugaritic () is an extinct Northwest Semitic language known through the Ugaritic texts discovered by French archaeologists in 1928 at Ugarit, including several major literary texts, notably the Baal cycle.

Ugaritic has been called &quot;the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform&quot;.

==Corpus==

The Ugaritic language is attested in texts from the 14th through the 12th century BC. The city of Ugarit was destroyed roughly 1190 BC.

Literary texts discovered at Ugarit include the &quot;Legend of Keret&quot;, the legends of Danel, the &quot;Myth of Baal-Aliyan&quot;, and the &quot;Death of Baal&quot;. The latter two are also known collectively as the &quot;Baal Cycle&quot;. All reveal aspects of ancient Northwest Semitic religion.

Edward Greenstein has proposed that Ugaritic texts might help solve biblical puzzles such as the anachronism of Ezekiel mentioning Daniel in actually referring to Danel, a hero from the Ugaritic Tale of Aqhat.

==Phonology==
Ugaritic had 28 consonantal phonemes (including two semivowels) and eight vowel phonemes (three short vowels and five long vowels): &quot;a ā i ī u ū ē ō&quot;. The phonemes &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; occur only as long vowels and are the result of monophthongization of the diphthongs &quot;аy&quot; and &quot;aw&quot;, respectively.


The following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Ugaritic, Classical Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew:

== Writing system ==
The Ugaritic alphabet is a cuneiform script used beginning in the 15th century BC. Like most Semitic scripts, it is an abjad, where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.

Although it appears similar to Mesopotamian cuneiform (whose writing techniques it borrowed), its symbols and symbol meanings are unrelated. It is the oldest example of the family of West Semitic scripts such as the Phoenician, Paleo-Hebrew, and Aramaic alphabets (including the Hebrew alphabet). The so-called &quot;long alphabet&quot; has 30 letters while the &quot;short alphabet&quot; has 22. Other languages (particularly Hurrian) were occasionally written in the Ugarit area, although not elsewhere.

Clay tablets written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the Levantine ordering of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic order of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets; and the South Semitic order, which gave rise to the order of the Ge&#x27;ez script. The script was written from left to right.

==Grammar==

Ugaritic is an inflected language, and its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in Akkadian, Classical Arabic and, to a lesser extent, Biblical Hebrew. It possesses two genders (masculine and feminine), three grammatical cases for nouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, and genitive), three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), and verb aspects similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order for Ugaritic is verb–subject–object (VSO) and subject–object–verb (SOV), possessed–possessor (NG), and noun–adjective (NA). Ugaritic is considered a conservative Semitic language, since it retains most of the phonemes, the case system, and the word order of the ancestral Proto-Semitic language.

<doc id="212347" wikidata="Q332652" url="?curid=212347" title="Ugaritic alphabet">
<text>The Ugaritic writing system is a cuneiform abjad (consonantal alphabet) with syllabic elements used from around either 1400 BCE or 1300 BCE for Ugaritic, an extinct Northwest Semitic language. It was discovered in Ugarit, modern Ras Shamra, Syria, in 1928. It has 30 letters. Other languages, particularly Hurrian, were occasionally written in the Ugaritic script in the area around Ugarit, although not elsewhere.

Clay tablets written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the North Semitic and South Semitic orders of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic orders of the reduced Phoenician writing system and its descendants, including the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, Hebrew, Syriac, Greek and Latin, and of the Geʽez script, which was also influenced by the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system, and adapted for Amharic. The Arabic and Ancient South Arabian scripts are the only other Semitic alphabets which have letters for all or almost all of the 29 commonly reconstructed proto-Semitic consonant phonemes. 

Note that several of these distinctions were only secondarily added to the Arabic alphabet by means of diacritic dots. According to Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz in &quot;Handbook of Ugaritic Studies&quot;, 1999,: &quot;The language they [the 30 signs] represented could be described as an idiom which in terms of content seemed to be comparable to Canaanite texts, but from a phonological perspective, however, was more like Arabic&quot; (82, 89, 614).

The script was written from left to right. Although cuneiform and pressed into clay, its symbols were unrelated to those of Akkadian cuneiform.

==Function==
The Ugaritic writing system was an augmented abjad. In most syllables only consonants were written, including the and of diphthongs. Ugaritic was unusual among early abjads because it also indicated vowels occurring after the glottal stop. It is thought that the letter for the syllable originally represented the consonant , as aleph does in other Semitic abjads, and that it was later restricted to with the addition, at the end of the alphabet, of and .

The final consonantal letter of the alphabet, &quot;s2&quot;, has a disputed origin along with both &quot;appended&quot; glottals, but &quot;The patent similarity of &quot;form&quot; between the Ugaritic symbol transliterated [s2], and the s-character of the later Northwest Semitic script makes a common origin likely, but the reason for the addition of this sign to the Ugaritic alphabet is unclear (compare Segert 1983: 201–218, Dietrich and Loretz 1988). In &quot;function&quot;, [s2] is like Ugaritic s, but only in certain words – other s-words are never written with [s2].&quot; 

The words that show &quot;s2&quot; are predominantly borrowings, and thus it is often thought to be a late addition to the alphabet representing a foreign sound that could be approximated by native /s/; Huehnergard and Pardee make it the affricate /ts/. Segert instead theorizes that it may have been syllabic /su/, and for this reason grouped with the other syllabic signs /ʔi/ and /ʔu/.

Probably the last three letters of the alphabet were originally developed for transcribing non-Ugaritic languages (texts in the Akkadian language and Hurrian language have been found written in the Ugaritic alphabet) and were then applied to write the Ugaritic language. The three letters denoting glottal stop plus vowel combinations were used as simple vowel letters when writing other languages.

The only punctuation is a word divider.

==Origin==

At the time the Ugaritic script was in use (c. 1300–1190 BCE), Ugarit, although not a great cultural or imperial centre, was located at the geographic centre of the literate world, among Egypt, Anatolia, Cyprus, Crete, and Mesopotamia. Ugaritic combined the system of the Semitic abjad with cuneiform writing methods (pressing a stylus into clay). Scholars have searched in vain for graphic prototypes of the Ugaritic letters in Mesopotamian cuneiform. 

Recently, some have suggested that Ugaritic represents some form of the Proto-Sinaitic script, the letter forms distorted as an adaptation to writing on clay with a stylus. There may also have been a degree of influence from the poorly understood Byblos syllabary. 

It has been proposed in this regard that the two basic shapes in cuneiform, a linear wedge, as in , and a corner wedge, as in , may correspond to lines and circles in the linear Semitic alphabets: the three Semitic letters with circles, preserved in the Greek Θ, O and Latin Q, are all made with corner wedges in Ugaritic: ṭ, ʕ, and q. Other letters look similar as well: h resembles its assumed Greek cognate E, while w, p, and θ are similar to Greek Y, Π, and Σ turned on their sides. Jared Diamond believes the alphabet was consciously designed, citing as evidence the possibility that the letters with the fewest strokes may have been the most frequent.

==Abecedaries==
Lists of Ugaritic letters, abecedaria, have been found in two alphabetic orders. The &quot;Northern Semitic order&quot; more is similar to the one found in Phoenician, Hebrew and Arabic, the earlier, so-called &quot;ʾabjadī&quot; order, and more distantly, the Greek and Latin alphabets. The &quot;Southern Semitic order&quot; is more similar to the one found in the South Arabian, and the Geʽez scripts. The Ugaritic (U) letters are given in cuneiform and transliteration.

==Ugaritic short alphabet==
Two shorter variants of the Ugaritic alphabet existed with findspots primarily not in the area of Ugarit. Findspots have included Tel Beit Shemesh, Sarepta, and Tiryns. It is generally found on inscribed objects vs the tablets of the standard Ugaritic alphabet and unlike the standard version it is usually written right to left. One variant contained 27 letters and the other 22 letters. It is not known what the relative chronology of the different Ugaritic alphabets was.

==Unicode==

Ugaritic script was added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2003 with the release of version 4.0.

The Unicode block for Ugaritic is U+10380–U+1039F:

Six letters for transliteration were added to the Latin Extended-D block in March 2019 with the release of Unicode 12.0:

<text>Mimetodon is a small mammal from the Paleocene of North America and perhaps Europe. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Neoplagiaulacidae.

The genus &quot;Mimetodon&quot; was named by Jepsen G.L. in 1940. It has also been known as &quot;Ectypodus&quot; (partly); &quot;Mesodma&quot; (partly); &quot;Neoplagiaulax&quot; (partly). McKenna and Bell (1997) lists possible material from the Upper Paleocene(?) of Europe.

==Species==
The species &quot;Mimetodon churchilli&quot; was named by Jepsen G.L. in 1940. Remains were found in the Tiffanian (Middle Paleocene)-age strata of Princeton Quarry in Wyoming (United States). The holotype is in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

The species &quot;Mimetodon krausei&quot; was named by Sloan R.E. in 1981. Remains were found in the Puercan (Lower Paleocene)-age strata of the San Juan Basin of New Mexico (United States). This holotype&#x27;s also in the collection of the Peabody Museum, Yale.

The species &quot;? Mimetodon nanophus&quot; was named by Holtzman in 1978. It has also been known as &quot;Neoplagiaulax nanophus&quot; (Holtzman 1978). Remains were found in the Middle-Upper Paleocene-age strata of the Tongue River Formation in North Dakota (United States). This might be the same as &quot;M. silberlingi&quot;.

The species &quot;Mimetodon silberlingi&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1935 and Schiebout in 1974. It has also been known as &quot;Ectypodus? silberlingi&quot; (Simpson 1935d); &quot;Mesodma silberlingi&quot; (Van Valen &amp; Sloan 1966); and &quot;?M. nanophus&quot;. Remains were found in the Torrejonian-Tiffanian (Middle Paleocene)-age strata in the Gidley Quarry of Montana and in Wyoming, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada. This species weighed an estimated 20 g.

<text>The Short Parliament was a Parliament of England that was summoned by King Charles I of England on 20 February 1640 and sat from 13 April to 5 May 1640. It was so called because of its short session of only three weeks.

After 11 years of personal rule between 1629 and 1640, and on the advice of the Earl of Strafford, Charles recalled Parliament to obtain money to finance his military struggle with Scotland in the Bishops&#x27; Wars. However, like its predecessors, the new parliament had more interest in redressing grievances than in voting the King funds for his war against the Scottish Covenanters.

John Pym, MP for Tavistock, quickly emerged as a major figure in debate; his long speech on 17 April expressed the refusal of the House of Commons to vote subsidies unless royal abuses were addressed. John Hampden, in contrast, was persuasive in private: he sat on nine committees. A flood of petitions concerning royal abuses were coming up to Parliament from the country. Charles&#x27;s attempted offer to cease the levying of ship money did not impress the House.

Annoyed with the resumption of debate on Crown privilege and the violation of parliamentary privilege by the arrest of the nine members in 1629, and unnerved about an upcoming scheduled debate on the deteriorating situation in Scotland, Charles dissolved Parliament on 5 May 1640, after only three weeks&#x27; sitting. This led to major discontent, particularly in London, and the following week a large armed mob attacked Lambeth Palace in the hope of capturing the unpopular Archbishop, William Laud, who was popularly blamed for the dissolution. In August 1640, a Scots Covenanter army invaded and occupied parts of northern England. The truce which followed compelled the King to call another parliament which he could not dissolve. This became known as the Long Parliament.

<text>Richard Gustavovich Sorge (; 4 October 1895 – 7 November 1944) was a German-Russian journalist and Soviet military intelligence officer who was active before and during World War II and worked undercover as a German journalist in both Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. His codename was &quot;Ramsay&quot; ().

Sorge is known for his service in Japan in 1940 and 1941, when he provided information about Adolf Hitler&#x27;s plan to attack the Soviet Union. Then, in mid-September 1941, he informed the Soviets that Japan would not attack the Soviet Union in the near future. A month later, Sorge was arrested in Japan for espionage. He was tortured, forced to confess, tried and hanged in November 1944. Stalin declined to intervene on his behalf with the Japanese.

He was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1964.

==Early life==

Sorge was born on 4 October 1895 in the settlement of Sabunchi, a suburb of Baku, Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Baku, Azerbaijan). He was the youngest of the nine children of Gustav Wilhelm Richard Sorge (1852–1907), a German mining engineer employed by the Deutsche Petroleum-Aktiengesellschaft (DPAG) and the Caucasian oil company Branobel and his Russian wife, Nina Semionovna Kobieleva. His father moved back to Germany with his family in 1898, after his lucrative contract expired. In Sorge&#x27;s own words:
Sorge attended Oberrealschule Lichterfelde when he was six. He described his father as having political views that were &quot;unmistakably nationalist and imperialist&quot;, which he shared as a young man. However, the cosmopolitan Sorge household was &quot;very different from the average bourgeois home in Berlin&quot;. Sorge considered Friedrich Adolf Sorge, an associate of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, to be his grandfather, but he was actually Sorge&#x27;s great-uncle.

Sorge enlisted in the Imperial German Army in October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. At 18, he was posted to a reserve infantry battalion of the 3rd Guards Division. He initially served on the Western Front and was wounded at the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915. After a period of convalescence in Berlin, Sorge was transferred to the Eastern Front and promoted to the rank of corporal. He was seriously wounded again in April 1917, shrapnel severed three of his fingers and broke both his legs, causing a lifelong limp. Afterward, Sorge was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class for bravery. He was subsequently declared medically unfit for service and discharged from the army. After serving in the war, Sorge, who had started out in 1914 as a right-wing nationalist, became disillusioned by what he called the &quot;meaninglessness&quot; of the conflict and gravitated to the political left.

During his convalescence he read Marx, Engels and Rudolf Hilferding and eventually became a communist, mainly by the influence of the father of a nurse with whom he had developed a relationship. He spent the remainder of the war studying philosophy and economics at the universities of Kiel, Berlin and Hamburg. In Kiel, he worked as an assistant to the eminent sociologist Kurt Albert Gerlach and also witnessed the sailors&#x27; mutiny which helped spark the German Revolution. He later joined the Independent Social Democratic Party and moved to Berlin, but arrived too late to participate in the Spartacist uprising.

Sorge received his doctorate in political science (Dr. rer. pol.) from Hamburg in August 1919. By this time he had joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and was engaged as an activist for the party in Hamburg and subsequently Aachen. His political views got him fired from both a teaching job and coal mining work.

==Soviet military intelligence agent==
Sorge was recruited as an agent for Soviet intelligence. With the cover of a journalist, he was sent to various European countries to assess the possibility of communist revolutions.

From 1920 to 1922, Sorge lived in Solingen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach, the ex-wife of Kurt Albert Gerlach, a wealthy communist and professor of political science in Kiel, who had taught Sorge. Christiane Gerlach later remembered about meeting Sorge for the first time: &quot;It was as if a stroke of lightning ran through me. In this one second something awoke in me that had slumbered until now, something dangerous, dark, inescapable...&quot;. 

Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921. In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the &quot;Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche&quot; (&quot;First Marxist Work Week&quot;) Conference in Ilmenau. Sorge continued his work as a journalist and also helped organize the library of the Institute for Social Research, a new Marxist think tank in Frankfurt.

In 1924, he was made responsible for the security of a Soviet delegation attending the KPD&#x27;s congress in Frankfurt. He caught the attention of one of the delegates, Osip Piatnitsky, a senior official with the Communist International, who recruited him. That year, he and Christiane moved to Moscow, where he officially joined the International Liaison Department of the Comintern, which was also an OGPU intelligence-gathering body. Apparently, Sorge&#x27;s dedication to duty led to his divorce. In 1925, he joined the Soviet Communist Party and received Soviet citizenship. Initially he worked as an assistant in the information department and was later the political and scientific secretary of the organizational department of the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute in Moscow. 

After several years he became enmeshed in the factional struggles in the Communist movement that occurred between the death of Vladimir Lenin and the consolidation of power by Joseph Stalin, being accused of supporting Stalin&#x27;s last factional opponent, Nikolai Bukharin, alongside three of his German comrades. However, in 1929, Sorge was invited to join the Red Army&#x27;s Fourth Department (the later GRU, or military intelligence) by department head Yan Karlovich Berzin. He remained with the department for the rest of his life. 

In 1929, Sorge went to the United Kingdom to study the labour movement there, the status of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the country&#x27;s political and economic conditions. He was instructed to remain undercover and to stay out of politics. In November 1929, Sorge was sent to Germany. He was instructed to join the Nazi Party and not to associate with any left-wing activists. As cover, he got a job with the agricultural newspaper &quot;Deutsche Getreide-Zeitung&quot;.

===China 1930===
In 1930, Sorge was sent to Shanghai. His cover was his work as the editor of a German news service and for the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;. He contacted another agent, Max Christiansen-Clausen. Sorge also met German Ursula Kuczynski and well-known American left-wing journalist Agnes Smedley, who also worked for the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;. She introduced Sorge to Hotsumi Ozaki of the Japanese newspaper &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; (a future Sorge recruit) and to Hanako Ishii, with whom he would become romantically involved. Sorge recruited Kuczynski as a Soviet agent and became romantically involved with her. 

Shortly after his arrival in China, he was able to send intelligence regarding plans by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government for a new offensive against the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War, based largely on information gathered from German military advisors to the Nationalists.

As a journalist, Sorge established himself as an expert on Chinese agriculture. In that role, he travelled around the country and contacted members of the Chinese Communist Party. In January 1932, Sorge reported on fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in the streets of Shanghai. In December, he was recalled to Moscow. His performance as an agent in Shanghai had been judged as successful by Berzin, having ensured that he and his agents had escaped detection and expanded the Soviet intelligence network.

===Moscow 1933===
Sorge returned to Moscow, where he wrote a book about Chinese agriculture. He also married Ekaterina Maximova (&quot;Katya&quot;), a woman he had met in China and brought back with him to Russia.

===Japan 1933===
In May 1933, the GRU decided to have Sorge organize an intelligence network in Japan. He was given the codename &quot;Ramsay&quot; (&quot;Рамзай&quot; &quot;Ramzai&quot; or &quot;Ramzay&quot;). He first went to Berlin to renew contacts in Germany and to obtain a new newspaper assignment in Japan as cover. In September 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army had seized the Manchuria region of China, which gave Japan another land border in Asia with the Soviet Union (previously, the Soviet Union and Japan had shared only the island of Sakhalin). At the time, several Kwantung Army generals advocated following up the seizure of Manchuria by invading the Soviet Far East, and as the Soviets had broken the Japanese Army codes, Moscow was aware of that and caused a &quot;major Japanese war scare&quot; in the winter of 1931–1932. Until the mid-1930s, it was Japan, rather than Germany, that was considered to be the main threat by Moscow.

Elsa Poretsky, the wife of Ignace Reiss, a fellow GRU agent, commented: &quot;His joining the Nazi Party in his own country, where he had a well documented police record was hazardous, to say the least... his staying in the very lion&#x27;s den in Berlin, while his application for membership was being processed, was indeed flirting with death&quot;.

In Berlin, he insinuated himself into the Nazi Party and read Nazi propaganda, particularly Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Sorge attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking to avoid saying anything inappropriate. His abstinence from drinking did not make his Nazi companions suspicious. It was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission, as he had been a heavy drinker. He later explained to Hede Massing, &quot;That was the bravest thing I ever did. Never will I be able to drink enough to make up for this time&quot;. Later, his drinking came to undermine his work.

In Germany, he received commissions from two newspapers, the &quot;Berliner Börsen Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Tägliche Rundschau&quot;, to report from Japan and the Nazi theoretical journal &quot;Geopolitik&quot;. Sorge was so successful at establishing his cover as an intensely Nazi journalist that when he departed Germany, Joseph Goebbels attended his farewell dinner. He went to Japan via the United States, passing through New York in August 1933.

Sorge arrived in Yokohama on 6 September 1933. After landing in Japan, Sorge became the Japan correspondent for the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;. As it was the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, Sorge&#x27;s status as its Tokyo correspondent made him, in many ways, the most senior German reporter in Japan. Sorge&#x27;s reputation as a Nazi journalist who detested the Soviet Union served as an excellent cover for his espionage work. His task in Japan was more challenging than that in China: the Soviets had very few intelligence resources in Japan, so Sorge would have to build a network of agents from nothing, under much tighter surveillance than he had faced in Shanghai. Sorge was told by his GRU superiors that his mission in Japan was to &quot;give very careful study to the question of whether or not Japan was planning to attack the USSR&quot;. After his arrest in 1941, Sorge told his captors:

This was for many years the most important duty assigned to me and my group; it would not be far wrong to say that it was the sole object of my mission in Japan... The USSR, as it viewed the prominent role and attitude taken by the Japanese military in foreign policy after the Manchurian incident, had come to harbor a deeply implanted suspicion that Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union, a suspicion so strong that my frequently expressed opinions to the contrary were not always fully appreciated in Moscow...

He was warned by his commanders not to have contact with either the underground Japanese Communist Party or the Soviet embassy in Tokyo. His intelligence network in Japan included the Red Army officer and radio operator Max Clausen, Hotsumi Ozaki and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukelić, a journalist working for the French magazine, &quot;Vu&quot;, and Japanese journalist Miyagi Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the &quot;Japan Advertiser&quot;. Max Clausen&#x27;s wife, Anna, acted as ring courier from time to time. From summer 1937, Clausen operated under the cover of his business, M Clausen Shokai, suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services. The business had been set up with Soviet funds and became a commercial success. Ozaki was a Japanese man from an influential family who had grown up in Taiwan, then a Japanese colony. He was an idealistic Sinophile who believed that Japan, which had started its modernisation with the Meiji Restoration, had much to teach China. However, Ozaki was shocked by the racism of Japanese policy towards China, with the Chinese being depicted as a people fit only to be slaves. Ozaki believed that the existing political system of Japan, with the emperor being worshipped as a living god, was obsolete, and that saving Japan from fascism would require Japan being &quot;reconstructed as a socialist state&quot;.

Between 1933 and 1934, Sorge formed a network of informants. His agents had contacts with senior politicians and obtained information on Japanese foreign policy. His agent Ozaki developed a close contact with Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Ozaki copied secret documents for Sorge.

As he appeared to be an ardent Nazi, Sorge was welcome at the German embassy. One Japanese journalist who knew Sorge described him in 1935 as &quot;a typical, swashbuckling, arrogant Nazi... quick-tempered, hard-drinking&quot;. As the Japan correspondent for the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, Sorge developed a network of sources in Japanese politics, and soon German diplomats, including the ambassador Herbert von Dirksen, came to depend upon Sorge as a source of intelligence on the fractious and secretive world of Japanese politics. The Japanese values of &quot;honne&quot; and &quot;tatemae&quot; (the former literally means &quot;true sound&quot;, roughly &quot;as things are&quot;, and the latter literally means &quot;façade&quot; or roughly &quot;as things appear&quot;), the tendency of the Japanese to hide their real feelings and profess to believe in things that they do not, made deciphering Japan&#x27;s politics difficult. Sorge&#x27;s fluency in Japanese enhanced his status as a Japanologist. Sorge was interested in Asian history and culture, especially Chinese and Japanese, and when he was sober, he tried to learn as much as he could. Meanwhile, Sorge befriended General Eugen Ott, the German military attaché to Japan and seduced his wife, Helma. Ott sent reports back to Berlin containing his assessments of the Imperial Japanese Army, which Helma Ott copied and gave to Sorge, who passed them on to Moscow (Helma Ott believed Sorge to be working merely for the Nazi Party). As the Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, German influence was strong and Ott had good contacts with Japanese officers.

In October 1934, Ott and Sorge made an extended visit to the puppet &quot;Empire of Manchukuo&quot;, which was actually a Japanese colony, and Sorge, who knew the Far East far better than Ott, wrote the report describing Manchukuo that Ott submitted to Berlin under his name. As Ott&#x27;s report was received favourably at both the Bendlerstrasse and the Wilhelmstrasse, Sorge soon became one of Ott&#x27;s main sources of information about the Japanese Empire, which created a close friendship between the two. In 1935, Sorge passed on to Moscow a planning document provided to him by Ozaki, which strongly suggested that Japan was not planning on attacking the Soviet Union in 1936. Sorge guessed correctly that Japan would invade China in July 1937 and that there was no danger of a Japanese invasion of Siberia.

On 26 February 1936, an attempted military coup took place in Tokyo. It was meant to achieve a mystical &quot;Shōwa Restoration&quot; and led to several senior officials being murdered by the rebels. Dirksen, Ott and the rest of the German embassy staff were highly confused as to why it was happening and were at a loss as to how to explain the coup to the Wilhelmstrasse. They turned to Sorge, the resident Japan expert, for help. Using notes supplied to him by Ozaki, Sorge submitted a report stating that the Imperial Way Faction in the Japanese Army, which had attempted the coup, was composed of younger officers from rural backgrounds. They were upset at the impoverishment of the countryside, and that the faction was not communist or socialist but just anti-capitalist and believed that big business had subverted the emperor&#x27;s will. Sorge&#x27;s report was used as the basis of Dirksen&#x27;s explanation of the coup attempt, which he sent back to the Wilhelmstrasse, which was satisfied at the ambassador&#x27;s &quot;brilliant&quot; explanation of the coup attempt.

Sorge lived in a house in a respectable neighborhood in Tokyo, where he was noted mostly for heavy drinking and his reckless way of riding his motorcycle. In the summer of 1936, a Japanese woman, Hanako Ishii, a waitress at a bar frequented by Sorge, moved into Sorge&#x27;s house to become his common-law wife. Of all of Sorge&#x27;s various relationships with women, his most durable and lasting one was with Ishii. She tried to curb Sorge&#x27;s heavy drinking and his habit of riding his motorcycle in a way that everyone viewed as almost suicidal. An American reporter who knew Sorge later wrote that he &quot;created the impression of being a playboy, almost a wastrel, the very antithesis of a keen and dangerous spy&quot;.

Ironically, Sorge&#x27;s spying for the Soviets in Japan in the late 1930s was probably safer for him than if he had been in Moscow. Claiming too many pressing responsibilities, he disobeyed Josef Stalin&#x27;s orders to return to the Soviet Union in 1937 during the Great Purge, as he realised the risk of arrest because of his German citizenship. In fact, two of Sorge&#x27;s earliest GRU handlers, Yan Karlovich Berzin and his successor, Artur Artuzov, were shot during the purges. In 1938, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German ambassador to Britain, was promoted to foreign minister, and to replace Ribbentrop, Dirksen was sent to London. Ribbentrop promoted Ott to be Dirksen&#x27;s replacement. Ott, now aware that Sorge was sleeping with his wife, let his friend Sorge have &quot;free run of the embassy night and day&quot;, as one German diplomat later recalled: he was given his own desk at the embassy. Ott tolerated Sorge&#x27;s affair with his wife on the grounds that Sorge was such a charismatic man that women always fell in love with him and so it was only natural that Sorge would sleep with his wife. Ott liked to call Sorge Richard der Unwiderstehliche (&quot;Richard the Irresistible&quot;), as his charm made him attractive to women. Ott greatly valued Sorge as a source of information about Japanese politics, especially Japan&#x27;s war with China, since Ott found that Sorge knew so many things about Japan that no other Westerner knew that he chose to overlook Sorge&#x27;s affair with his wife.

After Ott became the ambassador to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had breakfast with him daily and they discussed German–Japanese relations in detail, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge so much that he sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong and Manila. Sorge noted about his influence in the German embassy: &quot;They would come to me and say, &#x27;we have found out such and such a thing, have you heard about it and what do you think&#x27;?&quot;
On 13 May 1938, while he rode his motorcycle in Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge crashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes given to him by Ozaki at the time, if the police had discovered the documents, his cover would have been blown. However, a member of his spy ring got to the hospital and removed the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan had been caused by overzealous officers in the Kwantung Army and that there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war against the Soviet Union. Unaware that his friend Berzin had been shot as a &quot;Trotskyite&quot; in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938:

Dear Comrade! Don&#x27;t worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings to you and your friends. I request you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare.

Sorge never learned that Berzin had been shot as a traitor.

The two most authoritative sources for intelligence for the Soviet Union on Germany in the late 1930s were Sorge and Rudolf von Scheliha, the First Secretary at the German embassy in Warsaw. Unlike Sorge, who believed in communism, Scheliha&#x27;s reason for spying was money problems; he had a lifestyle beyond his salary as a diplomat, and he turned to selling secrets to provide additional income. Scheliha sold documents to the NKVD indicating that Germany was planning from late 1938 to turn Poland into a satellite state, and after the Poles refused to fall into line, Germany planned to invade Poland from March 1939 onward. Sorge reported that Japan did not intend for the border war with the Soviet Union that began in May 1939 to escalate into all-out war. Sorge also reported that the attempt to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance was floundering since the Germans wanted the alliance to be directed against Britain, while the Japanese wanted it to target the Soviets. Sorge&#x27;s reports that the Japanese did not plan to invade Siberia were disbelieved in Moscow and on 1 September 1939, Sorge was attacked in a message from Moscow:

Japan must have commenced important movements (military and political) in preparation for war against the Soviet Union but you have not provided any appreciable information. Your activity seems to [be] getting slack.

===Wartime intelligence===

Sorge supplied Soviet intelligence with information about the Anti-Comintern Pact and the German-Japanese Pact. In 1941, his embassy contacts made him learn of Operation Barbarossa, the imminent Axis invasion of the Soviet Union and the approximate date. On 30 May 1941, Sorge reported to Moscow, &quot;Berlin informed Ott that German attack will commence in the latter part of June. Ott 95 percent certain war will commence&quot;. On 20 June, Sorge reported: &quot;Ott told me that war between Germany and the USSR is inevitable... Invest [the code name for Ozaki] told me that the Japanese General Staff is already discussing what position to take in the event of war&quot;. Moscow received the reports, but Stalin and other top Soviet leaders ultimately ignored Sorge&#x27;s warnings, as well as those of other sources, including early false alarms. Other Soviet agents who also reported an imminent German invasion were also regarded with suspicion by Stalin.

It has been rumoured that Sorge provided the exact date of &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, but the historian Gordon Prange in 1984 concluded that the closest Sorge came was 20 June and that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (22 June) in advance. The date of 20 June was given to Sorge by &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (Lieutenant-Colonel) Erwin Scholl, the deputy military attaché at the German embassy. On a dispatch he sent the GRU on 1 June, which read, &quot;Expected start of German-Soviet war around June 15 is based on information Lt. Colonel Scholl brought with him from Berlin... for Ambassador Ott&quot;. Despite knowing that Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union sometime in May or June, Sorge was still shocked on 22 June when he learned of Operation Barbarossa. He went to a bar to get drunk and repeated in English: &quot;Hitler&#x27;s a fucking criminal! A murderer. But Stalin will teach the bastard a lesson. You just wait and see!&quot; The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on 15 June, Sorge had sent a radio dispatch saying, &quot;The war will begin on June 22&quot;. Prange, who despite not having access to material released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, did not accept the veracity of that report. Stalin was quoted as having ridiculed Sorge and his intelligence before &quot;Barbarossa&quot;:

In late June, Sorge informed Moscow that Ozaki had learned the Japanese cabinet had decided to occupy the southern half of French Indochina (now Vietnam) and that invading the Soviet Union was being considered as an option, but for the moment, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe had decided on neutrality. On 2 July, an Imperial Conference attended by the emperor, Konoe and the senior military leaders approved occupying all of French Indochina and to reinforce the Kwantung Army for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union. At the bottom of the report, the Deputy Head of Soviet Army General Staff Intelligence wrote, &quot;In consideration of the high reliability and accuracy of previous information and the competence of the information sources, this information can be trusted&quot;. In July 1941, Sorge reported that German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop had ordered Ott to start pressuring the Japanese to attack the Soviet Union but that the Japanese were resisting. On 25 August, Sorge reported to Moscow: &quot;Invest [Ozaki] was able to learn from circles closest to Konoye... that the High Command... discussed whether they should go to war with the USSR. They decided not to launch the war within this year, repeat, not to launch the war this year&quot;. On 6 September, an imperial conference decided against war with the Soviet Union and ordered the start of preparations for a possible war against the United States and the British Empire, which Ozaki reported to Sorge. At the same time, Ott told Sorge that all of his efforts to get Japan to attack the Soviet Union had failed. On 14 September, Sorge reported to Moscow, &quot;In the careful judgment of all of us here... the possibility of [Japan] launching an attack, which existed until recently, has disappeared...&quot; Sorge advised the Red Army on 14 September that Japan would not attack the Soviet Union until:
# Moscow had been captured.
# The Kwantung Army had become three times the size of Soviet Far Eastern forces.
# A civil war had started in Siberia.

Various writers have speculated that the information allowed the release of Siberian divisions for the Battle of Moscow, where the German Army suffered its first strategic defeat in the war. To that end, Sorge&#x27;s information might have been the most important military intelligence work in World War II. However, Sorge was not the only source of Soviet intelligence about Japan, as Soviet codebreakers had broken the Japanese diplomatic codes and so Moscow knew from signals intelligence that there would be no Japanese attack on the Soviet Union in 1941.

Another important item allegedly reported by Sorge may have affected the Battle of Stalingrad. Sorge reported that Japan would attack the Soviet Union from the east as soon as the German army captured any city on the Volga.

Sorge&#x27;s rival and opponent in Japan and East Asia was Ivar Lissner, an agent of the German &quot;Abwehr&quot;.

==Arrests and trials==

As the war progressed, Sorge was in increasing danger but continued his service. His radio messages were enciphered with unbreakable one-time pads, which were always used by the Soviet intelligence agencies and appeared as gibberish. However, the increasing number of the mystery messages made the Japanese begin to suspect that an intelligence ring was operating. 

Sorge was also coming under increasing suspicion in Berlin. By 1941, the Nazis had instructed SS &quot;Standartenführer&quot; Josef Albert Meisinger, the &quot;Butcher of Warsaw&quot;, who was by then the Gestapo resident at the German embassy in Tokyo, to begin monitoring Sorge and his activities. Sorge was able, through one of his lovers, Margarete Harich-Schneider, a German musician living in Japan, to gain the key to Meisinger&#x27;s apartment since it had once been her apartment. Much to his relief, he learned that Meisinger had concluded that the allegations that Sorge was a Soviet agent were groundless, and Sorge&#x27;s loyalty was to Germany. Sorge befriended Meisinger by playing on his principal weakness, alcohol, and spent much time getting him drunk, which contributed to Meisinger&#x27;s favourable evaluation of Sorge. Meisinger reported to Berlin that the friendship between Ott and Sorge &quot;was now so close that all normal reports from attachés to Berlin became mere appendages to the overall report written by Sorge and signed by the Ambassador&quot;. 

The &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, the Japanese secret police, intercepted many messages and began to close in against the German Soviet agent. Sorge&#x27;s penultimate message to Moscow in October 1941 reported, &quot;The Soviet Far East can be considered safe from Japanese attack&quot;. In his last message to Moscow, Sorge asked to be recalled to Germany, as there was no danger of a Japanese attack on the Soviet Union, and he wished to aid the Soviet war effort by providing more intelligence about the German war effort. Ozaki was arrested on 14 October 1941 and immediately interrogated. As the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; trailed Sorge, it discovered that Ott&#x27;s wife was a regular visitor to Sorge&#x27;s house and that he had spent his last night as a free man sleeping with her.

Sorge was arrested shortly thereafter, on 18 October 1941, in Tokyo. The next day, a brief Japanese memo notified Ott that Sorge had been swiftly arrested &quot;on suspicion of espionage&quot;, together with Max Clausen. Ott was both surprised and outraged as a result and assumed that it was a case of &quot;Japanese espionage hysteria&quot;. He thought that Sorge had been discovered to have passed secret information on the Japan-American negotiations to the German embassy and also that the arrest could have been caused by anti-German elements within the Japanese government. Nonetheless, he immediately agreed with Japanese authorities to &quot;investigate the incident fully&quot;. It was not until a few months later that Japanese authorities announced that Sorge had actually been indicted as a Soviet agent.

He was incarcerated in Sugamo Prison. Initially, the Japanese believed, because of his Nazi Party membership and German ties, that Sorge was an &quot;Abwehr&quot; agent. However, the &quot;Abwehr&quot; denied it. Under torture, Sorge confessed, but the Soviet Union denied he was a Soviet agent. The Japanese made three overtures to the Soviet Union and offered to trade Sorge for one of their own spies. However, the Soviet Union declined all of the Japanese attempts and maintained that Sorge was unknown to them. 
In September 1942, Sorge&#x27;s wife, Katya Maximova, was arrested by the NKVD on the charges that she was a &quot;German spy&quot; since she was married to the German citizen Sorge (the fact that Sorge was a GRU agent did not matter to the NKVD), and she was deported to the Gulag, where she died in 1943. Hanako Ishii, the Japanese woman who loved Sorge and the only woman whom Sorge loved in return, was the only person who tried to visit Sorge during his time in Sugamo Prison. During one of her visits, she expressed concern that Sorge, under torture by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, would name her as being involved in his spy ring, but he promised her that he would never mention her name. The &quot;Kempeitai&quot; was much feared in Japan for its use of torture as an investigation method. Sorge ultimately struck a deal with the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; that if it spared Ishii and the wives of the other members of the spy ring, he would reveal all. Ishii was never arrested by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;. Sorge told his captors:

That I successfully approached the German embassy in Japan and won the absolute trust by people there was the foundation of my organisation in Japan... Even in Moscow that fact that I infiltrated into the centre of the embassy and made use of it for my spying activity is evaluated as extremely amazing, having no equivalent in history.
After Sorge&#x27;s arrest, Meisinger used the increased spy fear of the Japanese to fraudulently denounce &quot;anti-Nazis&quot; as &quot;Soviet spies&quot; to the Japanese authorities. He was responsible for the persecution, internment and torture of the &quot;Schindler&quot; of Tokyo, Willy Rudolf Foerster. Foerster was forced to sell his company, which had employed a sizable number of Jewish refugees from Germany and the countries occupied by Germany. He and his Japanese wife survived, but after the war, the same former German diplomats, who had denounced and persecuted him as an &quot;anti-Nazi&quot;, would discredit him.

==Death==

Sorge was hanged on 7 November 1944, at 10:20 Tokyo time in Sugamo Prison and was pronounced dead 19 minutes later. Hotsumi Ozaki had been hanged earlier in the same day. Sorge&#x27;s body was not cremated because of wartime fuel shortages. He was buried in a mass grave for Sugamo Prison inmates in the nearby Zoshigaya Cemetery.

Sorge was survived by his mother, then living in Germany, and he left his estate to Anna Clausen, the wife of his radio operator, Max Christiansen-Clausen.

After hounding the American occupation authorities, Sorge&#x27;s Japanese lover, Hanako Ishii (石井 花子 &quot;Ishii Hanako&quot;, 1911 – 1 July 2000), located and recovered his skeleton on 16 November 1949. After identifying him by his distinctive dental work and a poorly-set broken leg, she took his body away and had him cremated at the Shimo-Ochiai Cremation Centre. She kept his own teeth, belt and spectacles and had made a ring of his gold bridgework, which she wore for the rest of her life. After her death, her own ashes were interred beside his. A white memorial stone at the site bears an epitaph in Japanese, the first two lines read: &quot;Here lies a hero who sacrificed his life fighting against war and for world peace&quot;.

The Soviet Union did not officially acknowledge Sorge until 1964.

It was argued that Sorge&#x27;s biggest coup led to his undoing because Stalin could not afford to let it become known that he had rejected Sorge&#x27;s warning about the German attack in June 1941. However, nations seldom officially recognise their own undercover agents.

==Posthumous recognition==


Initially, Sorge&#x27;s reputation in West Germany in the 1950s was highly negative, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers in the winter of 1941–1942. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany, as its German supporters sought a version of history that presented them as victims, rather than as followers, of Hitler. They portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian virtues, falsely portrayed the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; as an honourable fighting force that had nothing to do with the Holocaust and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that were even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. That way of remembering the Nazi past in the 1950s caused Operation Barbarossa and Germany&#x27;s war on the Eastern Front to be seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union of which Germans should be unashamed.

The first tentative efforts at changing the memory of the Nazi past started in the early 1950s, when German President Theodor Heuss gave a speech on 20 July 1954 that praised the &quot;putsch&quot; attempt of 20 July 1944. He argued that &quot;the men of July 20th&quot; were patriots rather than traitors, which was then a bold gesture. The first effort to present Sorge in a positive light occurred in the summer of 1953, when the influential publisher Rudolf Augstein wrote a 17-part series in his magazine, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. He argued that Sorge was not a Soviet agent but a heroic German patriot opposed to the Nazi regime whose motivation in providing intelligence to the Soviet Union was to bring down Hitler, rather than to support Stalin. Augstein also attacked Willoughby for his book &quot;The Shanghai Conspiracy&quot; that claimed that Sorge had caused the &quot;loss of China&quot; in 1949 and that the Sorge spy ring was in the process of taking over the U.S. government. Augstein argued that Willoughby and his fans had completely misunderstood that Sorge&#x27;s espionage was directed against Germany and Japan, not the U.S.

Such was the popularity of Augstein&#x27;s articles that the German author Hans Hellmut Kirst published a spy novel featuring Sorge as the hero, and Hans-Otto Meissner wrote the book &quot;Der Fall Sorge&quot; (&quot;The Sorge Case&quot;) that was a cross between a novel and a history by blending fact and fiction together with a greater emphasis on the latter. Meissner had served as third secretary at the German Embassy in Tokyo and had known Sorge. Meissner&#x27;s book, which was written as a thriller that engaged in &quot;orientalism&quot;, portrayed Japan as a strange, mysterious country in which the enigmatic and charismatic master spy Sorge operated to infiltrate both its government and the German embassy. Meissner presented Sorge as the consummate spy, a cool professional who was dressed in a rumpled trench coat and fedora and was a great womanizer, and much of the book is concerned with Sorge&#x27;s various relationships.

Later on, Meissner presented Sorge as a rather megalomaniac figure and, in the process, changed Sorge&#x27;s motivation from loyalty to communism to colossal egoism. He had Sorge rant about his equal dislike for both Stalin and Hitler and had him say that he supplied only enough information to both regimes to manipulate them into destroying each other since it suited him to play one against the other. At the book&#x27;s climax, Sorge agreed to work for the American Office of Strategic Services, in exchange for being settled in Hawaii, and he was in the process of learning that Japan is planning on bombing Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, but his love of women proved to be his undoing as the Japanese dancer Kiyomi rejected his sexual advances. Sorge finally seduced Kiyomi but lost valuable time, which allowed the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; to arrest him.

The American historian Cornelius Partsch noted some striking aspects of Meissner&#x27;s book such as his complete exoneration of the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; from any involvement in the criminal aspects of the Nazi regime. Meissner had Sorge constantly breaking into offices to steal information, which he did not do, as security at the German embassy was sloppy, and Sorge was trusted as an apparently dedicated Nazi journalist and so breaking into offices would have been unnecessary. Meissner avoided any mention of SS &quot;Standartenführer&quot; Josef Albert Meisinger, the &quot;Butcher of Warsaw&quot; who was stationed at the German embassy as the police attaché to Japan. Partsch wrote that Meissner gave Sorge almost superhuman abilities at lockbreaking, as he broke into various offices, safes and filing cabinets with the greatest ease, but in reality, secret documents were all too often left out in the open in unlocked rooms, and Sorge was allowed to wander about the embassy without an escort. Meissner portrayed the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; in the traditional manner, as a glamorous, elitist group that operated in exotic places like Japan serving Germany, not the Nazi regime.

Kirst&#x27;s book &quot;Die letzte Karte spielt der Tod&quot; was a novel that offered a considerably more realistic picture than Meissner&#x27;s romanticised portrayal of Sorge. Kirst portrayed Sorge as an existential hero, a deeply traumatized veteran of World War I, whose sleep was constantly disturbed by horrific nightmares of his war service, and when he was awake, he suffered from frequent panic attacks. Kirst&#x27;s book depicted Sorge as a &quot;lonely, desperate&quot; man, a tragic, wounded individual with a reckless streak who engaged in maniacal binge drinking, nearly suicidal motorcycle riding across the Japanese countryside, and though he wanted love, he was incapable of maintaining lasting relationships. Unlike Meissner, Kirst had Meisinger appear as one of the book&#x27;s villains by portraying him as an especially loathsome and stupid SS officer, who fully deserved to be deceived by Sorge. As part of Kirst&#x27;s portrayal of Sorge as a tragic man on the brink and as victim led him to portray Sorge&#x27;s spying for the Soviet Union by forces beyond his control. Kirst was more forceful in his condemnation of National Socialism than Meissner as his book maintained that the regime was so monstrously evil that an existential man forever on the brink of a mental breakdown like Sorge ended up spying for the Soviet Union as the lesser evil.

Partsch noted that both books were very much concerned with Sorge&#x27;s womanising, which neither author exaggerated, but presented the aspect of his personality in different ways. Kirst portrayed Sorge&#x27;s womanizing as part of the same self-destructive urges that led him to spy for the Soviet Union, but Meissner depicted Sorge&#x27;s womanizing as part of his callous narcissism and as his principal weakness, as his desire for Kiyomi finally destroyed him. In turn, that led to different depictions of the male body. Meissner portrayed it as the seductive instrument that entices female desire and led women into ill-advised relationships with Sorge, whose body is perfectly fit and attractive to women. Kirst, by contrast, correctly noted that Sorge walked with a pronounced limp because of a war wound, which had Sorge sarcastically say was because of his &quot;gallantry&quot; in his book, and Sorge&#x27;s wounded body served as a metaphor for his wounded soul. Partsch further commented that Meissner&#x27;s book was a depoliticised and personalised account of the Sorge spy ring, as he omitted any mention of Hotsumi Ozaki, an idealistic man who sincerely believed his country was on the wrong course, and he portrayed Sorge as a &quot;Faustian man&quot; motivated only by his vanity to exercise &quot;a god-like power over the world&quot; and gave Sorge &quot;an overblown, pop-Nietzschean sense of destiny&quot;.

The ultimate &quot;message&quot; of Meissner&#x27;s book was that Sorge was an amoral, egoistical individual whose actions had nothing to do with ideology and that the only reason for Germany&#x27;s defeat by the Soviet Union was Sorge&#x27;s spying, which suggested that Germany lost the war only because of &quot;fate&quot;. Meissner followed the &quot;great man&quot; interpretation of history that a few &quot;great men&quot; decide the events of the world, with everyone else reduced to passive bystanders. By contrast, Kirst pictured Sorge as a victim, as a mere pawn in a &quot;murderous chess game&quot; and emphasised Sorge&#x27;s opposition to the Nazi regime as the motivation for his actions. Kirst further noted that Sorge was betrayed by his own masters as after his arrest, and the Soviet regime denounced him as a &quot;Trotskyite&quot; and made no effort to save him. Partsch concluded that the two rival interpretations of Sorge put forward in the novels by Meissner and Kirst in 1955 have shaped Sorge&#x27;s image in the West, especially Germany, ever since their publication.

In 1954, the West German film director Veit Harlan wrote and directed the film &quot;Verrat an Deutschland&quot; about Sorge&#x27;s espionage in Japan. Harlan had been the favourite filmmaker of Nazi Information Minister Joseph Goebbels and directed many propaganda films, including &quot;Jud Süss&quot;. Harlan&#x27;s film is a romantic drama, starring Harlan&#x27;s wife, Kristina Söderbaum, as Sorge&#x27;s love interest. The film was publicly premiered by the distributor before it passed the rating system and so was withdrawn from more public performances and finally released after some editing had been done.

In 1961, a movie, &quot;Who Are You, Mr. Sorge?&quot;, was produced in France in collaboration with West Germany, Italy, and Japan. It was very popular in the Soviet Union as well. Sorge was played by Thomas Holtzmann.

In November 1964, twenty years after his death, the Soviet government awarded Sorge the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Sorge&#x27;s widow, Hanako Ishii, received a Soviet and Russian pension until her death in July 2000 in Tokyo. In the 1960s, the KGB, seeking to improve its image in the Soviet Union, began the cult of the &quot;hero spy&quot; with former Chekists working abroad being celebrated as the great &quot;hero spies&quot; in books, films and newspapers. Sorge was one of those selected for &quot;hero spy&quot; status. In fact, the Soviets had broken Japanese codes in 1941 and had already known independently of the intelligence provided by Sorge that Japan had decided to &quot;strike south&quot; (attacking the United States and the British Empire), instead of &quot;striking north&quot; (attacking the Soviet Union).

The Kremlin gave much greater attention to signals intelligence in evaluating threats from Japan from 1931 to 1941 than it did to the intelligence that was gathered by the Sorge spy ring, but since Soviet intelligence did not like to mention the achievements of its codebreakers, Soviet propaganda from 1964 onward gloried Sorge as a &quot;hero spy&quot; and avoided all mention that the Soviets had broken the Japanese codes. The Soviets, during the Cold War, liked to give the impression that all of their intelligence came from human intelligence, rather than signals intelligence, to prevent Western nations from knowing how much the Soviets collected from the latter source. A testament to Sorge&#x27;s fame in the Soviet Union was that even though Sorge worked for the GRU, not the NKVD, it was the KGB, which had far more power than the Red Army, that claimed him as one of its &quot;hero spies&quot; in the 1960s.

In 1965, three East German journalists published &quot;Dr Sorge funkt aus Tokyo&quot; in celebration of Sorge and his actions. Before the award, Sorge&#x27;s claim that Friedrich Adolf Sorge was his grandfather was repeated in the Soviet press. In a strange Cold War oddity, the authors stirred up a free speech scandal with patriotic letters to former Nazis in West Germany, which caused the &quot;Verfassungsschutz&quot; to issue a stern warning in early 1967: &quot;If you receive mail from a certain Julius Mader, do not reply to him and pass on the letter to the respective security authorities&quot;.
 In 1971, a comic book based on Sorge&#x27;s life, &quot;Wywiadowca XX wieku&quot; (&quot;20th Century Intelligence Officer&quot;), was published in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland to familiarise younger readers with Sorge.

There is a monument to Sorge in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sorge also appears in Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Adolf&quot; manga. In his 1981 book, &quot;Their Trade is Treachery&quot;, the author Chapman Pincher asserted that Sorge, a GRU agent himself, recruited the Englishman Roger Hollis in China in the early 1930s to provide information. Hollis later returned to England, joined MI5 just before World War II began and eventually became the director-general of MI5 from 1956 to 1965. As detailed by former MI5 staffer Peter Wright in his 1988 book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, Hollis was accused of being a Soviet agent, but despite several lengthy and seemingly thorough investigations, no conclusive proof was ever obtained.

One of Aleksandar Hemon&#x27;s first stories in English is &quot;The Sorge Spy Ring&quot; (&quot;TriQuarterly&quot;, 1997). The 2003 Japanese film &quot;Spy Sorge&quot;, directed by Masahiro Shinoda, details his exploits in Shanghai and in Japan. In the film, he is portrayed by the Scottish actor Iain Glen. In 2016, one of Moscow&#x27;s Moscow Central Circle rail stations was named after Sorge (Zorge). A Russian television series, &quot;Richard Sorge. Master Spy&quot;, was a twelve-episode series filmed in 2019.

<doc id="212356" wikidata="Q4974275" url="?curid=212356" title="Bronzewing pigeon">
<text>The bronzewing pigeons are a group of pigeons native to Australia which have distinctive iridescent wing patches that appear bronze or green-brown in dull light, but flash in many bright colours in the sun as the bird moves.
Three species are always known as &quot;bronzewings&quot; in the genus &quot;Phaps&quot;, and several broadly similar birds also have the trademark wing patch to a more or less obvious degree. Bronzewings are ground feeders, but are capable of very fast flight. They tend to browse quietly until disturbed, then remain still, their earthy browns blending into the earth and leaf litter until the intruder approaches too closely, when the bronzewings take off with an explosive burst of sudden wing clapping and feather noise, and disappear from sight within moments.

The dividing line between the bronzewings and the rock pigeons is arbitrary; essentially, rock pigeons are bronzewings without bronze on their wings. Members of the group include:

* The common bronzewing (&quot;Phaps chalcoptera&quot;) is a large, bulky pigeon with a small head, found in all parts of Australia bar some of the deep desert, Cape York Peninsula, and urban areas. Its advertising call is an extraordinary mournful repeated at metronomic intervals for an interminable length of time. Although rather wary by nature, birds in the urban fringes become quite used to humans. 
* The brush bronzewing (&quot;P. elegans&quot;) is uncommon, probably threatened. It is marginally smaller than the common bronzewing and rather secretive, except for its call, which is slightly faster and higher-pitched, but maintained through the hottest days with equally monotonous determination. Brush bronzewings nest low down, often on the ground, so are vulnerable to feral cats and foxes.
* Flock bronzewings (&quot;P. histrionica&quot;) roams the grasslands of the northern half of the continent. Once found in enormous flocks, they are still to be seen in their thousands. Pizzey&#x27;s description of their habits is memorable: &quot;When locally abundant, at end of day, undulating, shearwater-like flocks fly to water, settle short distance away, and walk in. Thirsty latecomers may drop directly into water and drink while spreadeagled, before springing off.&quot; 
* Crested pigeons (&quot;Ocyphaps lophotes&quot;) are distinctive, common, and widespread. Usually seen in small flocks in open woodlands or grasslands, they are always close to water. With the clearing of much forest and the provision of water in arid regions for cattle, crested pigeons have increased in number. 
* The spinifex pigeon (&quot;Geophaps plumifera&quot;) is an unmistakable ground-dwelling small pigeon, reddish-bronze in colour and prominently crested, with a unique upright, military stance. When disturbed, it prefers to run erratically, breaking into rapid, noisy flight only if pressed. A desert specialist, it is found in the arid and semiarid zones of the northern half of the continent.
* The partridge pigeon (&quot;G. smithii&quot;) is a dull brown bird about 26 cm long found only in pairs or small flocks in the grasslands of northern Northern Territory and northern Western Australia. 
* The squatter pigeon (&quot;G. scripta&quot;), like the very similar partridge pigeon, feeds, roosts, and nests on the ground, and prefers infertile sandy soils and gravel where the grass grows only thinly, allowing easy movement. Squatter pigeons are restricted to the eastern half of Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales.

<doc id="212357" wikidata="Q6805604" url="?curid=212357" title="Media coverage of the Iraq War">
<text>The 2003 invasion of Iraq had unprecedented US media coverage, especially cable news networks. US media was largely uncritical of the war, with many viewers falsely believing that Saddam Hussein and Iraq were involved with the 9/11 attacks. British media was more cautious in its coverage. The Qatari Al-Jazeera network was heavily critical of the war.

==US mainstream media coverage==
The most popular cable network in the United States for news on the war was Fox News, and had begun influencing other media outlets&#x27; coverage. At the time, Fox News was owned by Rupert Murdoch, a strong supporter of the war. On-screen during all live war coverage by Fox News was a waving flag animation in the upper left corner and the headline &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; along the bottom. The network has shown the American flag animation in the upper-left corner since the September 11 attacks. A study conducted in 2003 by Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) tracking the frequencies of pro-war and antiwar commentators on the major networks found that pro-war views were overwhelmingly more frequent. The FAIR study found that the two networks notably least likely to present critical commentary were Fox and CBS.

Anti-war celebrities appearing frequently on news networks included actors Janeane Garofalo, Tim Robbins, Mike Farrell, Rob Reiner, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon and director Michael Moore. In a widely publicized story, the country music band Dixie Chicks ignited boycotts and record burnings in the US for their negative remarks about President Bush in a concert in London.

MSNBC also brought the American flag back on screen and regularly ran a tribute called &quot;America&#x27;s Bravest&quot; which showed photographs sent by family members of troops deployed in Iraq. MSNBC also fired liberal Phil Donahue, a critic of Bush&#x27;s Iraq policy, a month before the invasion began and replaced his show with an expanded &quot;Countdown: Iraq&quot;, initially hosted by Lester Holt. Shortly after Donahue&#x27;s firing, MSNBC hired Michael Savage, a controversial conservative radio talk show host for a Saturday afternoon show. Although Donahue&#x27;s show had lower ratings than several shows on other networks, and most reports on its cancellation blamed poor ratings, it was the highest-rated program on MSNBC&#x27;s struggling prime time lineup at the time of its cancellation. In September 2002, Donahue&#x27;s show averaged 365,000 viewers, compared to rival Connie Chung&#x27;s 686,000 on CNN and Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s 2 million on Fox News, according to Nielsen Media Research.

In overall numbers, Fox News was number one, followed by CNN, and then MSNBC. It was a major success for Fox News, as many had believed CNN would reclaim the top spot, since it established itself with coverage from the 1990-1991 Gulf War.

In separate incidents, at least three different Western reporters were fired or disciplined due to their actions in covering the war. Peter Arnett, an NBC and National Geographic correspondent, was fired for giving an interview with Iraqi officials in which he questioned the United States&#x27; role and saying the &quot;first war plan had failed.&quot; Brian Walski of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was fired on March 31 for altering a photo of a British soldier warning Iraqi civilians to take cover from an Iraqi aerial bombing. Geraldo Rivera left Iraq after drawing a crude map in the sand during a live broadcast on Fox News, which raised concerns at the Pentagon that he was possibly revealing vital troop movements on air.

One study has compared the number of insurgent attacks in Iraq to the number of &quot;anti-resolve&quot; statements in the US media, the release of public opinion polls, and geographic variations in access to international media by Iraqis. The purpose was to determine if insurgents responded to information on &quot;casualty sensitivity.&quot; The researchers found that insurgent attacks spiked by 5 to 10% after increases in the number of negative reports of the war in the media. The authors identified this as an &quot;emboldenment effect&quot; and concluded &quot;insurgent groups respond rationally to expected probability of US withdrawal.&quot;

===Criticisms of pro-invasion bias===

A University of Maryland study on American public opinion found that:
*Fifty-seven percent of mainstream media viewers believed that Iraq gave substantial support to Al-Qaeda, or was directly involved in the September 11 attacks (48% after invasion).
*Sixty-nine percent believed that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the September 11 attacks.
*Twenty-two percent believed that weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq. (Twenty-one percent believed that chem/bio weapons had actually been used against US soldiers in Iraq during 2003)
*In the composite analysis of the PIPA study, 80% of Fox News watchers had one or more of these perceptions, in contrast to 71% for CBS and 27% who tuned to NPR/PBS.

In an investigation of the news coverage of Colin Powell&#x27;s 2003 UN address, rhetorical scholar John Oddo found that mainstream journalists &quot;strengthened Powell&#x27;s credibility, predisposed audiences to respond favorably to his discourse, and subtly altered his claims to make them seem more certain and warranted.&quot; In 2003, a study of the mainstream media released by Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting stated the network news disproportionately focused on pro-war sources and left out many anti-war sources. According to the study, 64% of guests on the studied networks were in favor of the Iraq War while total anti-war sources made up 10% of the guests (only 3% of US sources were anti-war). The study stated that &quot;viewers were more than six times as likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war; with US guests alone, the ratio increases to 25 to 1.&quot;

FAIR also conducted a similar study in February 2004. According to the study, which took place during October 2003, current or former government or military officials accounted for 76 percent of all 319 sources for news stories about Iraq which aired on network news channels.

After the invasion, the editors of the &quot;New York Times&quot; apologized for its coverage of Hussein&#x27;s alleged weapons programs, acknowledging that &quot;we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims (related to Iraqi weapons programs) as new evidence emerged — or failed to emerge.&quot;

During the invasion, critics argued that the mainstream media unduly focused on optimistic events, such as the toppling of a Saddam Hussein statue in Firdos Square, which was staged with the help of the US military forces, thus downplaying more negative news developments. In particular, the mainstream media has been criticized for underreporting news about Iraqi civilian casualties, which are estimated to be anywhere between 100,000 and 650,000.

As the security situation in Iraq has worsened since the invasion, many journalists have found it increasingly difficult to report from Iraq without jeopardizing their lives. Some media outlets, unable to afford the cost of additional security, have even abandoned their bureaus in Baghdad. This trend has forced journalists to depend even more heavily on US military sources, which has led some critics to call into question the impartiality of their reports on events such as the Iraqi elections.

A post-2008 election poll by FactCheck.org found that 48% of Americans believe Hussein played a role in the 9/11 attacks; the group concluded that &quot;voters, once deceived, tend to stay that way despite all evidence.&quot;

===Use of propaganda===


Media critics such as Noam Chomsky, have alleged that the media acted as propaganda for not questioning the legality of the Iraq war and thus, took on the fundamental assumptions given by the government. This is despite overwhelming public opinion in favor of only invading Iraq with UN authorization.

In a 2010 interview, Chomsky compared media coverage of the Afghan War Diaries and lack of media coverage to a study of severe health problems in Fallujah. While there was ample coverage of the Afghan War Diaries there was no American coverage of the Fallujah study, in which the health situation in Fallujah was described by the British media as &quot;worse than Hiroshima&quot;.

Chomsky also asserts that the media accurately covered events such as the Battle of Fallujah but because of an ideological bias, it acts as pro-government propaganda. In describing coverage of raid on Fallujah General Hospital he states that &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;accurately recorded the battle of Fallujah but it was celebrated...it was celebration of ongoing war crimes&quot;. The article in question was &quot;Early Target of Offensive Is a Hospital&quot;.

It was revealed on October 2, 2016 that the Pentagon paid British PR firm Bell Pottinger $540mn to create fake terrorist videos, fake news articles for Arab news channels and propaganda videos.

An investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism revealed the details of the multi-million pound operation. Bell Pottinger is understood to have been funded some $540million from the US Department of Defence (DoD) for five contracts from May 2007 to December 2011, according to the Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Lord Tim Bell, the former spin doctor to Margaret Thatcher, confirmed Bell Pottinger reported to the Pentagon, the CIA and the National Security Council on its work in Iraq.

===Pentagon military analyst group===

An investigation by the &quot;New York Times&quot; discovered that top Pentagon officials met with news analysts where they gave the analysts &#x27;special information&#x27; and then tried to convince them to speak favorably about the Iraq war. The discovery was based on 8000 pages of secret information that had been revealed to The New York Times through a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act. The article states that top Pentagon officials would invite news analysts to secret meetings, and urge the analysts to speak positively of the war. Often, the US would give &quot;classified information,&quot; trips, and contracts to the news analysts.

==US independent media coverage==

The Media Workers Against the War and the Indymedia network, among many other independent networks including many journalists from the invading countries, provided reports in a way difficult to control by any government, corporation or political party. In the United States Democracy Now, hosted by
Amy Goodman has been critical of the reasons for the 2003 invasion
and the alleged crimes committed by the US authorities in Iraq.

Australian war artist George Gittoes collected independent interviews with soldiers while producing his documentary Soundtrack To War.

The war in Iraq provided the first time in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as soldier blogs or milblogs, were started during the war.

==Non-US media coverage==
Non-US coverage sometimes differed strongly in tone and content from US media coverage.

In some countries television journalists&#x27; behavior differed significantly during the conflict compared to Gulf War conflicts. Jean-Marie Charon said most journalists were more cautious, often using the conditional form and rigorously citing sources.

The crew of , Britain&#x27;s flagship, demanded that the BBC be turned off on the ship because of what they saw as a clear anti-Coalition or &quot;pro-Iraq&quot; bias. One BBC correspondent had been embedded on the ship, but the crew said they had no complaints of his reporting specifically. The sailors on board the ship claimed that the BBC gave more credit to Iraqi reports than information coming from British or allied sources, often questioning and refusing to believe reports coming from Coalition sources while reporting Iraqi claims of civilian casualties without independent verification. The ship&#x27;s news feed was replaced with Sky News. Ironically, it later emerged from a study conducted by Professor Justin Lewis of the School of Journalism at Cardiff University that the BBC was the most pro-war of British networks, a finding confirmed in a separate study by the German newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.

The war in Iraq saw Abu Dhabi TV mature into a credible Al-Jazeera rival. However, the war did not benefit Al-Arabiya, the newest of Arabic news networks. Created by the Saudi audio-visual group MBC to compete with Al-Jazeera (whose tone often displeases Saudi leaders), Al-Arabiya was launched on February 19, 2003.

In Australia, the Seven Network launched a news bulletin in March 2003, titled &quot;Target Iraq&quot;, covering the latest news from the crisis in the country. When the strike on Iraq ended, the bulletin was renamed &quot;Seven&#x27;s 4:30 News&quot; and it became a permanent fixture on the Seven Network&#x27;s schedule.

In Philippines, the ABS-CBN launched a news bulletin in March 2003, titled &quot;ABS-CBN News Special Coverage: Iraq War 2003&quot;, covering the latest news from the crisis in the country.
When the strike on Iraq War ended, the bulletin was renamed &quot;TV Patrol&quot; and it became a permanent fixture on the ABS-CBN&#x27;s schedule.

==Iraqi media coverage==
According to reports from three separate media watchdog groups, the Iraqi media was under tight state control prior to the invasion. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s eldest son, Uday, oversaw as many as a dozen newspapers, sat on several important editorial boards, and ran the most popular television station, Youth TV. In a 2001 report, the French-based Committee to Protect Journalists wrote that Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government maintained a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on Iraqi media outlets, and that &quot;insulting the president or other government authorities is punishable by death.&quot;

In the wake of the invasion, the Iraqi media establishment changed drastically. Hundreds of newspapers, television stations, and radio stations sprouted both inside and outside of the country. Many of these new media outlets were closely linked with religious or political organizations, and closely reflected the interests of their backers. Some observers have suggested that this has contributed to increased sectarianism in the country.

The burgeoning Iraqi media market has also proven subject to manipulation by the United States government. In November 2005, the Los Angeles Times reported on a secret Pentagon program to pay Iraqi media outlets to publish articles favorable of the US invasion and occupation. This initiative relied on US-based subcontractors such as the Lincoln Group to write and place stories with headlines such as &quot;Iraqis Insist on Living Despite Terrorism&quot; and &quot;More Money Goes to Iraq&#x27;s Development.&quot; According to anonymous sources within the US government, Army Lt. Gen. John R. Vines oversees the program. In March 2006, General George Casey, the Army&#x27;s second in command, indicated that this practice, which did not &quot;violate US law or Pentagon guidelines,&quot; would continue.

==&quot;Embedded&quot; reporters==

Around 600 journalists were &quot;embedded&quot; with military units, 80% being British or American. The Pentagon established the policy of &quot;embedding&quot; reporters with military units.

Robert Entman, professor of communication at the George Washington University and critic of mainstream media for decades, indicated it was a very wise tactic from the Pentagon. He mentioned there were more chances for the journalists to make favorable reports whilst in Iraq with British and American soldiers than if they had been asking questions in Washington. Entman indicated there is a natural cultural bias of American journalists in favor of military troops of their own country and that journalists do like to satisfy the government upon which they rely for information, as well as the public on whom they depend commercially. Entman also mentioned the high number of retired generals making comments on TV, pointing out these could not be considered independent experts as they were still paid by the government. He claims the British Broadcasting Corporation was much more neutral and informative on cultural and historical background than most American television reports.

The Ministry of Defense (MoD) explained &quot;maintaining morale as well as information dominance will rank as important as physical protection&quot;. An MoD-commissioned commercial analysis of the print output produced by embeds shows that 90% of their reporting was either &quot;positive or neutral.&quot;

==Firdos Square controversy==

On April 9, 2003, a large statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad&#x27;s Firdos Square, directly in front of the Palestine Hotel where the world&#x27;s journalists had been quartered, was toppled by a US M88 tank recovery vehicle surrounded by dozens of celebrating Iraqis, who had been attempting to pull down the statue earlier with little success. One such futile attempt by sledgehammer wielding weightlifter Kadhem Sharif particularly caught media attention. Eventually the M88 was able to topple the statue which was jumped upon by Iraqi citizens who then decapitated the head of the statue and dragged it through the streets of the city hitting it with their shoes. The destruction of the statue was shown live on cable news networks as it happened and made the front pages of newspapers and covers of magazines all over the world - symbolizing the fall of the Saddam government. The images of the statue falling came as a shock to many Arab viewers, who had thought that Iraq was winning the war.

Before the statue was toppled, Marine Corporal Edward Chin of the 3rd battalion 4th Marines regiment climbed the ladder and placed an American flag over the statue&#x27;s face. An Iraqi flag was then placed over the statue. The event was widely publicized, but allegations that it had been staged were soon published. One picture from the event, published in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, was allegedly doctored to make the crowd appear larger. A report by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated it was an unnamed Marine colonel, not Iraqi civilians who had decided to topple the statue; and that a quick-thinking Army psychological operations team then used loudspeakers to encourage Iraqi civilians to assist and made it all appear spontaneous and Iraqi-inspired. According to Tim Brown at Globalsecurity.org: &quot;It was not completely stage-managed from Washington, DC but it was not exactly a spontaneous Iraqi operation.&quot;

The 2004 film &quot;Control Room&quot; deals with the incident in depth and indicated that the overall impression of Al Jazeera reporters was that it was staged. The Marines present at the time, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, maintain that the scene was not staged other than the assistance they provided.

==Coverage of US casualties==
Media coverage of US military casualties has been met by Bush administration efforts to downplay reports about soldiers&#x27; deaths throughout the invasion. Unlike the Vietnam War, when the media regularly published photographs of flag-draped coffins of American military personnel killed in action, the Bush administration prohibited the release of such photographs during the Iraq invasion. This ban mirrors a similar ban put in place during the Gulf War, though it appears to have been enforced less tightly during previous military operations.

According to Senator Patrick Leahy, the administration also scheduled the return of wounded soldiers to Dover Air Force Base for after midnight so that the press would not see them. This practice was documented by both the Drudge Report and Salon.com. A number of Dover photographs were eventually released in response to a Freedom of Information request filed by blogger Russ Kick.

Media coverage related to casualty milestones, such as the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th US soldier killed, have consistently sparked controversy among supporters and defenders of the invasion. On September 7, 2004 the US recorded its 1,000th casualty of the war, when four servicemen died that day (three in one incident, one in another). Presidential candidate John Kerry called it a &quot;tragic milestone.&quot; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld argued the 1000th milestone was passed long ago in the War on Terrorism, with the loss of life on September 11, 2001 being in the thousands, and going on the offensive against terrorism &quot;has its cost.&quot;

On October 25, 2005 the Department of Defense announced the 2,000th US death from the war as Staff Sergeant George T. Alexander Jr., who was killed when a roadside bomb detonated near his M2 Bradley in the city of Samarra. In response, Senators including Dick Durbin made statements opposing the war, and activists held six hundred anti-war protests and candlelight vigils across the United States.

In contrast, The Pentagon downplayed the death; Lt. Col. Steven Boylan, chief spokesman for the US military in Iraq, told the Associated Press that &quot;the 2,000 service members killed in Iraq supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom is not a milestone. It is an artificial mark on the wall set by individuals or groups with specific agendas and ulterior motives.&quot;

The US death toll reached 3,000 on December 31, 2006 when Texas soldier Spc. Dustin R. Donica was killed in Baghdad, near the office of Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni Arab politician and leader of the Iraqi National Dialogue Front. The milestone came just one day after the execution of Saddam Hussein and just as the Bush Administration was revising its wartime strategy.

As of May 29, 2012, according to the US Department of Defense casualty website, there were 4,409 total deaths.

===Ban lifted===

Soon after taking office in January 2009, President Barack Obama asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to review the ban on media coverage of coffins. In February Gates announced that the ban would be lifted, and permission for coverage of individual soldiers would be at the discretion of their next of kin. On 5 April the return of Phillip Myers, an Air Force Staff Sergeant killed in Afghanistan the day before, became the first return of a US serviceman&#x27;s remains to receive media coverage since the instatement of the original ban in 1991.

==Bombing of Al Jazeera==
On April 8, 2003, US aircraft bombed the Baghdad bureau of Qatar satellite TV station Al Jazeera killing a journalist and wounding another despite the US being informed of the office&#x27;s precise coordinates prior to the incident. An Al Jazeera correspondent said that very clear, yellow signs reading &quot;Press&quot; covered the building from all sides and on the roof. A US Central Command spokesman said that the station &quot;was not and never had been a target.&quot; The US government had repeatedly criticized Al Jazeera as &quot;endangering the lives of American troops.&quot;

The attack had drawn particular criticism because the Kabul office of Al Jazeera had been bombed in the US invasion of Afghanistan.

On 2 April 2003, in a speech given in New York City, British Home Secretary David Blunkett commented on what he believed to be sympathetic and corrupt reporting of Iraq by Arab news sources. He told the audience that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to get the true facts if the reporters of Al Jazeera are actually linked into, and are only there because they are provided with facilities and support from, the régime.&quot; His speech came only hours before Al Jazeera was ejected from Baghdad by the US occupation.

A top secret memo leaked by a British civil servant and a parliamentary researcher detailed a lengthy conversation on April 16, 2004 between Prime Minister Blair and President Bush, in which Bush according to British media allegedly proposed bombing the Qatar central office of Al Jazeera. House press secretary, Scott McClellan, describing it as &quot;outlandish&quot; said, &quot;Any such notion that we would engage in that kind of activity is just absurd.&quot; A UK government official suggested that the Bush threat had been &quot;humorous, not serious.&quot; Another source said Bush was &quot;deadly serious.&quot; The UK government refuses to publish the memo and two civil servants have been charged with violating Britain&#x27;s Official Secrets Act for allegedly disclosing the document. For a more full discussion, see Al Jazeera bombing memo.

==Attack on Palestine Hotel==
On the same day as the destruction of the Baghdad bureau of Al Jazeera, a US tank fired a HEAT round at what the US military later said was a suspected Iraqi forward artillery observer. Due to what the US states was a communications error, the tank fired at the Palestine Hotel, where approximately 100 international reporters in Baghdad were based, instead of the correct building, killing two journalists, Taras Protsyuk of Reuters and Jose Couso of the Spanish network Telecinco and wounding three other correspondents.

After interviewing &quot;about a dozen reporters who were at the scene, including two embedded journalists who monitored the military radio traffic before and after the shelling occurred&quot; the Committee to Protect Journalists said the facts suggested &quot;that attack on the journalists, while not deliberate, was avoidable.&quot; The Committee to Protect Journalists went on to say that &quot;Pentagon officials, as well as commanders on the ground in Baghdad, knew that the Palestine Hotel was full of international journalists and were intent on not hitting it&quot;. It is not clear that orders not to fire upon the hotel had actually made it to the tank level. Reporters Without Borders demanded proof from Donald Rumsfeld that incidents &quot;were not deliberate attempts to dissuade the media from reporting.&quot; Amnesty International demanded independent investigation.

==Journalist casualties==

More journalists were killed during the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq than in any war in history. The Committee to Protect Journalists research shows that &quot;at least 150 journalists and 54 media support workers were killed in Iraq from the US-led invasion in March 2003 to the declared end of the war in December 2011.&quot;

There were a number of journalist casualties during the invasion, including fourteen deaths (some not directly war-related). Michael Kelly, an influential reporter, columnist, and editor, died in a Humvee accident on April 3, 2003. NBC&#x27;s David Bloom died of a blood clot three days later. Both Kelly and Bloom were embedded with the US Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division.

ITN reporter Terry Lloyd, who originally broke the news that Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons, was killed by US forces near Basra on March 22, 2003.

==Critical journalists==

Knight Ridder journalists Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel wrote a series of critical articles in the months before the invasion questioning the need for war and criticizing the intelligence behind it. Charles J. Hanley of the Associated Press, reporting from on the scene in Iraq with UN inspectors, made clear there was no evidence of WMD. In one article, on January 18, 2003, he reported that the 13 &quot;facilities of concern&quot; cited by US and British intelligence had been inspected repeatedly with no violations found. All three journalists were featured in Bill Moyers&#x27; 2007 special PBS report &quot;Buying the War.&quot;

Journalist Peter Arnett was fired by MSNBC and National Geographic after he declared in an interview with the Iraqi information ministry that he believed the US strategy of &quot;shock and awe&quot; had failed. He also went on to tell Iraqi State TV that he had told &quot;Americans about the determination of the Iraqi forces, the determination of the government, and the willingness to fight for their country,&quot; and that reports from Baghdad about civilian deaths had helped antiwar protesters undermine the Bush administration&#x27;s strategy. The interview was given 10 days before the fall of Baghdad.

<doc id="212359" wikidata="Q6213458" url="?curid=212359" title="Joel Fuhrman">
<text>Joel Fuhrman (born December 2, 1953) is an American celebrity doctor who advocates a plant-based diet termed the &quot;nutritarian&quot; diet which emphasizes nutrient-dense foods. His practice is based on his nutrition-based approach to obesity and chronic disease, as well as promoting his products and books. He has written books promoting his dietary approaches including the bestsellers &quot;Eat to Live&quot;, &quot;Super Immunity&quot;, &quot;The Eat to Live Cookbook&quot;, &quot;The End of Dieting&quot; (2016) and &quot;The End of Heart Disease&quot; (2016). He sells a related line of nutrition-related products.

==Life and career==
Fuhrman was born in New York City, on December 2, 1953. He is Jewish. He was a competitor in the amateur figure skating circuit. He was a member of the US World Figure Skating Team and placed second in the US National Pairs Championship in 1973. In 1973, he suffered a heel injury which prevented him from competing. Fuhrman claims that an alternative medicine therapy recommended by a naturopath helped speed his recovery, and led him to become interested in alternative medicine. He came in 3rd place at the 1976 World Professional Pairs Skating Championship in Jaca, Spain, skating with his sister, Gale Fuhrman, but due to short-term massive muscle loss from fasting was unable to make the Olympic team. In 1988, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Fuhrman is a board-certified family physician and serves as Director of Research for the Nutritional Research Foundation.

==Diet and health==

===Nutritarian diet===

Fuhrman has advocated eating at least one pound of raw vegetables and another pound of cooked vegetables each day with an emphasis on green vegetables along with beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, nuts and seeds. He also recommends eating at least one cup of beans a day to benefit from the resistant starch and increased satiety. The Nutritarian diet encourages whole plant foods and restricts dairy products, meat, snacks between meals, fruit juice, vegetable oils and processed foods.

Furhman&#x27;s Nutritarian diet excludes dairy and meat for six weeks, but after this period a small amount of chicken and fish can be eaten. Fuhrman also allows a limited amount of low-fat dairy products, olive oil and refined carbohydrates on the diet after six weeks. If animal products are not added back into the diet, Furhman recommends vitamin B12, vitamin D and omega 3 supplements. On the Nutritarian diet, dairy products, eggs and fish are to make up less than 10% of calories whilst legumes make between 10% and 40% and raw and cooked vegetables make between 30% and 60% of calories.

===Nutrient density===

Fuhrman popularized the notion of nutrient density in what he calls the Health Equation: Health = Nutrients/Calories (abbreviated as H = N/C). Peter Lipson, a physician and writer on alternative medicine, has been heavily critical of Fuhrman&#x27;s health equation, writing that since its terms cannot be quantified, it is &quot;nothing more than a parlor trick&quot;. Fuhrman created what he calls the &quot;Aggregate Nutrient Density Index&quot; or ANDI, a ranking of foods based on his claims of micronutrient concentration and kale is at the top of this list. Whole Foods began using the scores as a marketing project and reported that the sales of high scoring foods &quot;skyrocketed&quot;.

===Reception===

Fuhrman has heavily marketed his products and his infomercials have &quot;become a staple during the self-improvement bloc of PBS pledge drives.&quot; In the October 2012 edition of &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Mark Adams stated that Fuhrman &quot;preaches something closer to fruitarianism or Christian Science than to conventional medical wisdom&quot;. Adams also reported that Fuhrman believes that the flu vaccine &quot;isn&#x27;t effective at all&quot;. David Gorski has commented that Fuhrman has promoted a vitalistic view of food and the pseudoscientific idea of detoxification.

Dietitian Carolyn Williams has described Fuhrman&#x27;s Nutritarian diet as a fad diet. According to Williams &quot;This can be helpful for people who feel stuck in their weight loss journey and want to totally reset or detox their diet following a holiday or vacation. Although this diet is marketed as an eating pattern, it is essentially a fad diet. Those who do try this diet should go into it knowing that it is not sustainable for everyone long-term, and is only a temporary quick fix to lose weight.&quot;

Harriet Hall, a founder of Science-Based Medicine, a website owned and operated by the New England Skeptical Society, reviewed Fuhrman&#x27;s Nutritarian diet and commented that he tends to incorrectly assume association studies show causation and that his diet has not been tested in controlled trials. Hall stated that &quot;Fuhrman makes extraordinary claims for the Nutritarian diet, but extraordinary claims must be supported by extraordinary evidence, and the evidence he presents is far from compelling.&quot;

<doc id="212364" wikidata="Q178991" url="?curid=212364" title="Pierre Claude François Daunou">
<text>Pierre Claude François Daunou (; 18 August 176120 June 1840) was a French statesman of the French Revolution and Empire. An author and historian, he served as the nation&#x27;s archivist under both the Empire and the Restoration, contributed a volume to the &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot;, and published more than twenty volumes of lectures he delivered when he held the chair of history and ethics at the Collège de France.

== Early career ==
He was born at Boulogne-sur-Mer. After studying at the school the Oratorians operates there, he joined the order in Paris in 1777. He was professor in various seminaries from 1780 to 1787, when he was ordained a priest. He had by then published essays and poems that established his reputation in literary circles.

With the onset of the French Revolution, he supported the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; a proffered appointment to a high Catholic Church office failed to induce him to alter his position.

Elected to the National Convention by the Pas-de-Calais &quot;département&quot;, he associated himself with the moderate Girondists and strongly opposed the death sentence imposed on King Louis XVI. Daunou took little part in the Girondist clash with their radical opponents, The Mountain, but was involved in the events of his party&#x27;s overthrow in the summer of 1793 and was imprisoned for almost a year.

== Directory ==
In December 1794 he returned to the convention and was the principal author of the Constitution of the Year III that established the Directory in November 1795. It is probably because of his Girondinism that the Council of the Ancients was given the right of convoking the Council of Five Hundred outside Paris, an expedient which made possible Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (the 18 Brumaire&quot;) in 1799.

Daunou also drew up the plans for the erection and organization of the Institut de France. He was instrumental in crushing the Royalist insurgency known as the 13 Vendémiaire. He was elected by twenty-seven &quot;départements&quot; as member of the Council of Five Hundred and became its first president. He was ineligible for election as a director, having himself set the age qualification for that office at forty when he was thirty-four. When the government passed into the hands of Talleyrand and his associates, Daunou returned briefly to literature, but in 1798 he was sent to Rome to organize the Roman Republic.

== Napoleon and Restoration ==
In 1799, Daunou returned the role of statesman, preparing the Constitution of the Year VIII, which established the Consulate, under which Napoleon held the position of First Consul. He remained largely ambivalent towards Napoleon, but supported him against Pope Pius VII and the Papal States, providing him historical arguments in a scholarly treatise &quot;Sur la puissance temporelle du Pape&quot; (&quot;On the Temporal Power of the Papacy&quot;) in 1809.

Nonetheless, he took little part in the new regime, of which he was resentful, and turned more and more to literature. At the Restoration in 1814, he was deprived of the post of &quot;archivist of the Empire&quot;, which he had held since 1807. In 1819 he became the chair of history and ethics at the Collège de France; in that role, his courses were among the most famous of the period. With the advent of the July Monarchy in 1830, he regained his old post, now under the title &quot;archivist of the Kingdom&quot;. In 1839, Daunou was made a peer.

<text>Pierre Henri Leroux (7 April 1797 – 12 April 1871) was a French philosopher and political economist. He was born at Bercy, now a part of Paris, the son of an artisan.

== Life ==

His education was interrupted by the death of his father, which compelled him to support his mother and family. Having worked first as a mason and then as a compositor, he joined P. Dubois in the foundation of &quot;Le Globe&quot; which became in 1831 the official organ of the Saint-Simonian community, of which he became a prominent member. In November of the same year, when Prosper Enfantin became leader of the Saint-Simonians and preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the &quot;couple-prêtre&quot;, Leroux separated himself from the sect. In 1834, he published an essay entitled &quot;Individualism and Socialism&quot; which, despite its message of scepticism towards both tendencies, introduced the term socialism in French political discourse. In 1838, with Jean Reynaud, who had seceded with him, he founded the &quot;Encyclopédie nouvelle&quot; (eds. 1838–1841). Amongst the articles which he inserted in it were &quot;De l&#x27;égalité&quot; and &quot;Refutation de l&#x27;éclectisme&quot;, which afterwards appeared as separate works.
In 1840, he published his treatise &quot;De l&#x27;humanité&quot; (2nd ed. 1845), which contains the fullest exposition of his system, and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In 1841 he established the &quot;Revue indépendante&quot;, with the aid of George Sand, over whom he had great influence. Her &quot;Spiridion&quot;, which was dedicated to him, &quot;Sept cordes de la lyre&quot;, &quot;Consuelo&quot;, and &quot;La Comtesse de Rudolstadt&quot;, were written under the Humanitarian inspiration. Leroux also became embroiled in the philosophical controversy between F.W.J. Schelling and the Young Hegelians in the early 1840s. A favourable comment about Schelling prompted a public reply from Hegel&#x27;s disciple Karl Rosenkranz. 

In 1843, he established at Boussac (Creuse) a printing association organized according to his systematic ideas, and founded the &quot;Revue sociale&quot;. At the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848 Leroux proclaimed the republic in the town of Boussac, becoming its mayor on February 25. Subsequently, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly, and in 1849 to the Legislative Assembly, where he sat with the radical socialist deputies and often spoke, though his speeches were criticised as abstract and mystical. Within the Assembly, Leroux represented the Seine Department. 

An opponent of Louis Bonaparte, Leroux went into exile after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1851, settling with his family in Jersey, where he pursued agricultural experiments and wrote his socialist poem &quot;La Grève de Samarez&quot;. Karl Marx nominated Leroux for the Central Committee of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. On the definitive amnesty of 1869 he returned to Paris.

== Views ==
Leroux&#x27;s fundamental philosophical principle is that of what he calls the &quot;triad&quot;—a triplicity which he finds to pervade all things, which in God is &quot;power, intelligence and love,&quot; in man &quot;sensation, sentiment and knowledge&quot;.

Leroux was described as a Protestant. His religious doctrine is pantheistic; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis. In social economy he preserves the family, country and property, but finds in all three, as they now are, a despotism which must be eliminated. He imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished. His solution seems to require the creation of families without heads, countries without governments and property without right of possession. In politics he advocates absolute equality — a democracy.

His views might be considered anti-Semitic in present times. Leroux believed that Jewish-controlled banks had replaced the social institution of the churches with modern values which he had a negative view of: &quot;We are destined to a future where individualism and egoism will triumph at the expense of the social good; the Jews, a people who epitomize individualism and egoism, are thus predestined to triumph over others.&quot; Leroux is highly critical of the modern capitalist economic system which he blames on Jews. According to Leroux Jews, who had once crucified Jesus, were crucifying the Christian world with capitalist tyranny.
