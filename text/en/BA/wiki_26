<text>Margaret LeAnn Rimes Cibrian (born August 28, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She originally rose to success as a country music artist at the age of 13 and has since crossed over into pop, contemporary Christian, and other musical genres. Rimes has placed more than 40 singles on international charts since 1996. She has sold more than 48 million records worldwide, with 20.8 million album sales in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her at number 17 in terms of sales success in the 1990–1999 decade.

Born in Mississippi and raised in Texas, Rimes demonstrated a unique singing ability from a young age. Through her parents&#x27; efforts, Rimes began performing in various musical theater and local music contests. Working with her father as producer and manager, Rimes recorded two studio albums as a preteen. She developed a local following that helped bring her to the attention of Nashville label Curb Records. In 1996, aged 13, she signed a contract with Curb and released the single &quot;Blue&quot;, which became a top-10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. Her 1996 album &quot;Blue&quot; was certified Platinum six times and established her as a major country artist. In 1997, Rimes crossed over into pop music with &quot;How Do I Live&quot;, which became one of the best-selling singles of the 1990s. The track was included on her next album &quot;You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs&quot; (1997), which was certified quadruple Platinum. It was followed up with the Platinum-certified albums &quot;Sittin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot; (1998) and &quot;LeAnn Rimes&quot; (1999). In the following years, Rimes released several pop singles for soundtrack albums, which include &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot;, the latter of which became a major hit worldwide. Several of these soundtrack singles were compiled on the Platinum-certified album &quot;I Need You&quot; (2001).

Breaking away from her father&#x27;s management in the 2000s, Rimes released the Gold-certified pop album &quot;Twisted Angel&quot; (2002) and the Christmas record &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; (2004). She returned to her country origins with &quot;This Woman&quot; (2005), which produced three country hits and was certified Gold. Later album releases were &quot;Whatever We Wanna&quot; (2006), &quot;Family&quot; (2007), &quot;Lady &amp; Gentlemen&quot; (2011), and &quot;Spitfire&quot; (2013). After ending her long-time professional relationship with Curb Records, Rimes released the Christmas album &quot;Today Is Christmas&quot; (2015) and pop studio album &quot;Remnants&quot; (2016), the latter of which featured two number one &quot;Billboard&quot; dance club hits. In the years that followed, she released the albums &quot;&quot; (2020) and &quot;God&#x27;s Work&quot; (2022).

Rimes has also had several notable television film roles. She began her acting career with the film &quot;Holiday in Your Heart&quot; (1997). After appearing in the television film &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (2009), Rimes began an affair with co-star Eddie Cibrian which received notable media attention. She has since appeared in &quot;Good Intentions&quot; (2010), &quot;Reel Love&quot; (2011), and &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas, Eve&quot; (2018). In 2024, she was featured as a coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; and &quot;The Voice UK&quot;.

== Early life ==
Margaret LeAnn Rimes was born on August 28, 1982, in Jackson, Mississippi. She is the only child of Wilbur Rimes and Belinda Butler. The family moved to Garland, Texas, when she was six. She was enrolled in vocal and dance classes, and was performing at local talent shows at the age of five. Rimes began her career in musical theatre, performing in a Dallas, Texas, production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and almost landing the lead part in the Broadway production of &quot;Annie&quot;. After appearing on the network television competition show &quot;Star Search&quot;, where she clearly charmed host Ed McMahon in addition to being a one-week champion, Rimes decided to go into country music. Rimes appeared a number of times on &quot;Johnnie High&#x27;s Country Music Revue&quot; in Arlington, Texas, which gained the attention of local talent scouts.

By age nine, Rimes was an experienced singer. She toured nationally with her father and also regularly performed a cappella renditions of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the opening of the Dallas Cowboys football games. In 1991, she released her debut album &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; on an independent label called Nor Va Jak. Due to the independent album&#x27;s success throughout the Dallas music community, Rimes was discovered by local disc jockey and record promoter Bill Mack. Mack was impressed by Rimes&#x27;s vocal ability, and over the next three years, he made various attempts to sign Rimes to a major country music label. The center of Mack&#x27;s plan to bring her success was his 1958 single, &quot;Blue&quot;. In July 1994, Rimes included her first version of &quot;Blue&quot; on her second and final Nor Va Jak release, &quot;All That&quot;; she also co-wrote &quot;Share My Love&quot; for this album. Mack then arranged a recording contract for Rimes with Curb Records. She signed with the Nashville label in 1996.

== Career ==
=== 1996: Country music breakthrough with &quot;Blue&quot; ===

After signing with Curb Records, Rimes recorded a new version of &quot;Blue&quot; as a single. According to Rimes, the record company accidentally released the version she had recorded as an 11-year-old, and that it was this version that peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart of Hot Country Songs. Critics drew comparisons to Rimes with that of Patsy Cline, to whom the song had been pitched in 1963; Mack claimed that Cline was unable to record the song before her death. A press release for the song said that Mack had been &quot;waiting over 30 years to find the right vocalist to sing it&quot;. The song had previously been recorded by multiple artists over the years, nonetheless, the media attention to &quot;Blue&quot; further added to the belief that Rimes was the successor to Cline&#x27;s legacy.

Rimes&#x27;s first Curb album and third overall, &quot;Blue&quot; was released in 1996. The disc sold 123,000 copies in its first week. It peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. In March 1999, &quot;Blue&quot; was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) In Canada, the album was certified triple-platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (now Music Canada), a certification which at the time honored shipments of 300,000 copies in that country. As of 2009, it has sold over eight million copies worldwide. Shawn Haney of AllMusic considered the album to be &quot;delightful&quot; and that it could &quot;help inspire other young teens&quot;. Two additional singles from the album made the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart: &quot;One Way Ticket (Because I Can)&quot;, which peaked at number one, and its follow-up &quot;The Light in Your Eyes&quot;, which peaked at number five. &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;One Way Ticket (Because I Can)&quot; both made top 10 on &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks, then the main country music chart published in Canada, with &quot;Blue&quot; being her most successful single there.

&quot;Blue&quot;″s commercial success led to the first of several industry award nominations for Rimes. The title track earned Rimes her first Grammy Award at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997, in the category of Best New Artist and Best Female Country Vocal Performance; she became the youngest person to win these awards. That year, the Country Music Association also awarded Rimes the Horizon Award, becoming the youngest person ever to be nominated and win a Country Music Association award. The Academy of Country Music also awarded her as Top New Female Vocalist, Song of the Year and Single Record of the Year in 1996; she would be nominated for the latter two again in 1997.

=== 1997–1999: &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;, &quot;Sittin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot;, and &quot;LeAnn Rimes&quot; ===
By 1997, Rimes&#x27;s parents divorced. In February 1997, Curb released &quot;Unchained Melody: The Early Years&quot;, a reissue of the previously independently released &quot;All That&quot; (1994). It was named after Rimes&#x27;s cover of Alex North and Hy Zaret&#x27;s 1955 standard &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, which was a number 3 &quot;Billboard&quot; country hit that March. &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. Three months later, Rimes appeared a live television special recorded at Walt Disney World in Orlando for &quot;Disney Channel in Concert&quot;. Curb released Rimes&#x27;s next album &quot;You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs&quot; that September. It was a departure from Rimes&#x27;s previous releases with more adult contemporary-styled music than country. The album was preceded by the single &quot;How Do I Live&quot;, which became a major pop hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number two. &quot;How Do I Live&quot; set a new record for becoming the longest-running single in &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 history, spending 69 weeks on the chart. The song was ranked as the most successful song of the 1990s by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. The song also saw success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number seven and was certified Platinum. The title track from &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single; the song peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified Gold. &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified quadruple Platinum by the RIAA the following year for shipments of four million copies.

Rimes made her acting debut on the ABC television film &quot;Holiday in Your Heart&quot;, which premiered on December 14. The film was based on Rimes&#x27;s titular book, which was released two months earlier. The film was the start of three-movie contract that Rimes was offered by ABC in 1998. The film was semi-autobiographical, with Rimes playing a country performer who discovers that her grandmother becomes hospitalized. In the film, Rimes performed several of her hit songs. In 1998, she played a teen runaway in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.
Rimes&#x27;s next Curb release was 1998&#x27;s &quot;Sittin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot;. The album was given mixed reviews. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that Rimes &quot;holds her own in the more popular style of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, wherein a spectacular voice upstages a song, grins and goes on about her business.&quot; &quot;Sittin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot; debuted at number two on the Top Country Albums chart and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The project spawned the number four &quot;Billboard&quot; country hit &quot;Commitment&quot;, the Top 20 Pop hit &quot;Looking Through Your Eyes&quot; from the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;, and the number 10 country hit &quot;Nothin&#x27; New Under the Moon&quot;. In July, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies.

In October 1999, Curb released Rimes&#x27;s self-titled sixth studio album. The record was a collection of country music cover songs mainly by Patsy Cline. The album received mostly positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album one of her &quot;better&quot; efforts. Beth Johnson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a positive review and said that Rimes&#x27;s voice &quot;dares listeners to take note of what is missing in her interpretations–the gutsiness and gut-wrenching urgency of performers who felt what they sang.&quot; The album debuted at number one on the Top Country Albums chart, topping the country albums chart for two weeks. It also peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The album sold over one million copies in the United States, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The project also included the new song &quot;Big Deal&quot;. Released as the lead single, &quot;Big Deal&quot; peaked at number six on the country singles charts. Also in 1999, Rimes collaborated with Elton John on &quot;Written in the Stars&quot; for the stage musical &quot;Aida&quot;.

=== 2000–2004: &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Twisted Angel&quot;===

In 2000, Rimes contributed &quot;I Need You&quot; to the soundtrack for the 1999 TV movie &quot;Jesus&quot;. The song was issued as the lead single from the soundtrack in July 2000 in both pop and country versions. The song reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart and number 11 on the Hot 100. Rimes appeared in the 2000 film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; and contributed four songs to its soundtrack; Rimes was the singing voice for Piper Perabo&#x27;s character Violet Sanford in the film. In August, &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; was released as a single from the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Marking a change in style for Rimes, it was compared to works by Britney Spears. &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; became a major pop hit worldwide, charting within the top 10 of several countries. In the United States, it reached number 11 on the Hot 100 and was certified Platinum, while in the United Kingdom, the song topped the charts and was certified double Platinum. In Australia, the song was the biggest-selling single of 2001, where it peaked at number 1 for six weeks, topped the year-end chart, and was certified triple Platinum. In total, the song received Platinum certifications from six countries and Gold certifications from a further three. &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; won Rimes a &quot;Blockbuster Entertainment Award&quot; for &quot;Favorite Song from a Movie&quot;.
In November 2000, Rimes sued Curb to nullify her recording contract with the label; it had originally been signed on her behalf by her parents five years earlier. In January 2001, Curb released the compilation &quot;I Need You&quot;, which consists of four previously released soundtrack appearances alongside six new tracks. Rimes publicly disowned the album; she said that it was compiled from studio outtakes and released without her knowledge or input. Despite her comments, Curb continued to promote the record and released three singles in support of the album. The first of these releases was &quot;But I Do Love You&quot;, which had previously appeared on the &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; soundtrack and was remixed in a country style for inclusion on &quot;I Need You&quot;. This version peaked at number 20 on the country songs chart. &quot;I Need You&quot; generally featured more pop-oriented songs than her previous releases, being described by Stephen Erlewine as &quot;her first full-fledged pop album&quot; with &quot;footing squarely within adult contemporary pop&quot;. Chris Neal from &quot;Country Weekly&quot; praised the album and Rimes&#x27;s vocal performance, saying that &quot;all the songs are solid&quot;. However, he also noted that &quot;most of the songs have only a tenuous connection to country&quot; and said &quot;how you feel about &quot;I Need You&quot; will largely depend on whether you see LeAnn’s shift toward pop as a positive development.&quot; In November 2001, Rimes was released from her original contract with Curb and subsequently signed a new agreement with the label under new terms. &quot;I Need You&quot; was reissued with additional tracks on March 23, 2002. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

On October 1, 2002, Rimes released her seventh studio album &quot;Twisted Angel&quot;. The album was mainly produced by Desmond Child and was a drastic departure from her previous studio albums, containing a combination of dance-pop and adult contemporary with more adult material. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, which experienced success internationally but failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. The single was particularly successful in Australia, where it peaked at number seven and was certified Platinum. The second single released from the album was &quot;Tic Toc&quot;, which became her first top-10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. Rimes received criticism from critics and fans alike for her decision to release a pop album. She explained: &quot;I&#x27;ve gotten grilled a lot about that album. You know, people just didn&#x27;t want me to experiment. When you&#x27;re a teenager growing up, you learn alot about yourself, and that&#x27;s what I did with my music. I did something different, something that not a lot of people expected me to do. [...] And, in a lot of ways, that did work for me. It was a great learning experience. So, nope, no regrets whatsoever.&quot; &quot;Twisted Angel&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA.

In July 2003, Rimes released her first children&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Jag&quot;. In November, Rimes released her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in North America; its international counterpart &quot;The Best of LeAnn Rimes&quot; was released in February 2004. Both compilations included a collaboration with Irish singer Ronan Keating on &quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, which was released as a single that May. The song was most successful in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at numbers 4 and 5 on the Scottish and UK singles charts, respectively. In October 2004, Rimes released her first Christmas album and eighth studio album &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;.

=== 2005–2013: &quot;This Woman&quot;, further album releases, and film roles ===
In January 2005, Rimes&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;This Woman&quot; was released. The album was a return to her country origins. &quot;It&#x27;s mainly a Country album, but it&#x27;s my kind of Country music,&quot; she told the &quot;Voice of America&quot;. The album reached the top five of both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums chart and the Billboard 200. The album spawned the singles &quot;Nothin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Love Makes Sense&quot;, &quot;Probably Wouldn&#x27;t Be This Way&quot;, and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, all of which reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. In 2005, Rimes became the host of the USA Network talent competition &quot;Nashville Star&quot;. A vocal chord illness prevented her from appearing in two episodes. In summer 2006, Rimes released the studio album &quot;Whatever We Wanna&quot;. The album arrived when &quot;This Woman&quot; and its singles were experiencing a resurgence in sales in the United States. As a result, the release of &quot;Whatever We Wanna&quot; in the states was delayed and later canceled; the album was only released overseas. In the United Kingdom, the album reached number 15. In 2006, Rimes performed the theme song to the &quot;Holly Hobbie &amp; Friends&quot; series of animated specials and guest starred in the series&#x27; Christmas episode.
In October 2007, Asylum-Curb issued Rimes&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Family&quot;. Every track on the album features writing credits from Rimes. Allmusic said that it &quot;illustrates her range as a singer along with some true strength as a writer.&quot;
The project&#x27;s lead single &quot;Nothin&#x27; Better to Do&quot; reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart while the second single, &quot;Good Friend and a Glass of Wine&quot;, reached the top 40. In the fall of 2007, Rimes appeared with Joss Stone for an episode of &quot;Crossroads&quot; that aired on CMT. In 2008, Rimes joined Kenny Chesney on his &quot;Poets and Pirates Tour&quot;. In February 2009, the third single from &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;What I Cannot Change&quot;, became the first country song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts.

In 2009, Rimes played the role of Meg Galloway in the made-for-television film &quot;Northern Lights&quot; which aired on the Lifetime network. The film was based on Nora Roberts&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. Eddie Cibrian played opposite Rimes as her character&#x27;s love interest. Media publicity of their real-life affair helped make &quot;Northern Lights&quot; the network&#x27;s most-watched television movie, with four and a half million viewers in March 2009. On April 14, 2009, Rimes published the collaborative self-help book &quot;What I Cannot Change&quot; with Darrell Brown. In 2010, Rimes played a supporting role in the movie &quot;Good Intentions&quot; and contributed to the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In 2011, Rimes released her twelfth studio album &quot;Lady &amp; Gentlemen&quot;. Rimes co-produced it along with country singer Vince Gill. The album contained covers of country songs originally recorded by male artists that Rimes re-recorded from a female perspective. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Mikael Wood concluded that &quot;The result is predictably solid, though it rarely sheds new light on the top-shelf material.&quot; The album&#x27;s cover of John Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Swingin&#x27;&quot; was nominated for a Grammy award. &quot;Lady &amp; Gentlemen&quot; also featured two tracks which were original recordings: &quot;Crazy Women&quot; and &quot;Give&quot;. Both tracks were released as singles and were minor hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The same year, Rimes starred in the television film &quot;Reel Love&quot;. The film aired on Country Music Television and also starred actor Burt Reynolds. She also had a guest role on the television show &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;.

Rimes&#x27;s final album with Curb, &quot;Spitfire&quot;, was released in 2013. On this project, she co-produced with keyboardist Darrell Brown and co-wrote nine of its 13 songs. &quot;Spitfire&quot; centered around Rimes&#x27;s affair with future husband Eddie Cibrian and the media speculation around their relationship. &quot;I used to get mad at the tabloids, but I should be thanking them because they helped me write this whole record,&quot; she commented. The album sold 10,798 copies in its first week and debuted at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also debuted at number nine on the country albums chart. Sales of the album were considered &quot;disappointing&quot; by several news outlets, while singles released from the album failed to become commercially successful. That year, she made a guest appearance on the FX television show &quot;Anger Management&quot;.

===2014–present: Later work and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;===

In 2014, Rimes starred in the reality television series &quot;LeAnn &amp; Eddie&quot; alongside Eddie Cibrian. The program aired on the VH1 network. The intention of the reality show was to &quot;help clear the air&quot; about their romantic relationship. &quot;This show gave us an opportunity to take back our lives in a way and show a different side of us than what people really believe,&quot; Rimes commented. After one season, the show was cancelled by VH1.

In July 2014, Rimes announced that she would release three Christmas extended plays over the course of the next three years. In October 2014, the first of these planned EPs was released, &quot;One Christmas: Chapter 1,&quot; issued through Iconic Entertainment. It included the lead single, a cover of Gayla Peevey&#x27;s &quot;I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas&quot;. The EP peaked at number 20 on the Top Country Albums chart and number 35 on the Top Holiday Albums list. To promote the project, Rimes embarked on the &quot;One Christmas Tour&quot;, which toured the United States in the winter of 2014. Rimes&#x27;s original plan of multiple EP releases was dropped and replaced with a full-length holiday album in 2015. That year she released &quot;Today Is Christmas&quot; through Prodigy Entertainment. A duet of &quot;Celebrate Me Home&quot; with Gavin DeGraw was included. The record reached number two on the Holiday albums chart and number nine on the Country Albums chart.

In 2016, Rimes signed with RCA UK, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment, and released a cover of Brandi Carlile&#x27;s &quot;The Story&quot;. It was included on her fifteenth studio album titled &quot;Remnants&quot;. First issued in the United Kingdom in 2016, &quot;Remnants&quot; was later released in the United States in February 2017. The album reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart and number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned the singles &quot;Long Live Love&quot; and &quot;Love Is Love Is Love&quot; which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart; &quot;Love Line&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single and peaked at number 5. In 2017, Rimes made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; where she sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

In June 2018, Rimes released &quot;Re-Imagined&quot; through EverLe Records and the Thirty Tigers label. The EP contains five tracks from her back catalogue that she re-recorded. The new recording of &quot;Borrowed&quot; features duet vocals from Stevie Nicks. Later in 2018, Rimes appeared in the Hallmark original television film titled &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas, Eve&quot;. She recorded the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which was released in October 2018. Included were covers of Christmas standards, as well as new recordings composed with producer Darrell Brown. In 2019, Rimes released her first live album, &quot;&quot;.

In 2020, Rimes competed as &quot;Sun&quot; on the fourth season of the Fox reality singing competition &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. Her identity was revealed during the season finale on December 16, 2020, where she was declared the winner of the season. She was later a guest panelist in the season five finale. Darius Rucker also joined her in the show. In November 2020, Rimes released her sixteenth studio record &quot;&quot;. Its 12 tracks were built from chants and daily mantras rather than traditional songs. A corresponding health and wellness podcast titled &quot;Wholly Human&quot; followed that focused on similar themes. Rimes produced and composed the album with longtime musical collaborator Darrell Brown. &quot;As I started meditating I started chanting and singing. And as I felt what was coming through needed to come through and felt good, I would press record on my phone and get it down, then expand it from there,&quot; Rimes explained of the projects.

In 2022, Rimes released the album &quot;God&#x27;s Work&quot;. Rimes celebrated her 25th year in the music industry with a special CMT Crossroads episode featuring Carly Pearce, Brandy Clark, Ashley McBryde and Mickey Guyton airing on April 14, 2022. In April 2023, Rimes collaborated with Tenille Arts on &quot;Jealous of Myself&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Voice and vocal ability===
Rimes&#x27;s voice has been described as a soprano. She has often been described by critics as having &quot;powerhouse vocals&quot;. Critics took notice from her earliest recordings. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Don McLeese commented, &quot;Though &#x27;Young Country&#x27; doesn&#x27;t get much younger than Rimes, she already shows more poise and maturity than many artists twice her age.&quot; In similar vein, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2005 &quot;Rimes&#x27;s voice is far and away her strongest selling point. Rich and worldly, it belied her young age -- especially when she tackled a vintage-sounding country song like &#x27;Blue&#x27;.&quot; From a young age, Rimes also chose material that was considered beyond her years. In her first album, Rimes recorded such material as Deborah Allen&#x27;s &quot;My Baby&quot;, whose lyrics say, &quot;my baby is a full-time lover, my baby is a full-grown man.&quot; Other material such as Diane Warren&#x27;s &quot;How Do I Live&quot; had also been considered too mature for Rimes&#x27;s age and was the main reason why her version of the song was not chosen to be used in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Con Air&quot;.
As Rimes matured into adulthood, critics continued to take notice of her voice. In reviewing a 2005 concert, Chrissie Dickinson of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; found that while her stage presence was lacking, Rimes&#x27;s voice had significant power: &quot;But what Rimes lacked in stage electricity she made up for in vocal power. She has superlative control over that big voice, a soaring instrument that can belt and whisper within the same song.&quot; In reviewing her 2011 album &quot;Lady &amp; Gentlemen&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated, &quot;Throughout it all, Rimes hits her marks with ease...she&#x27;s become a stronger, more nuanced singer over the years.&quot; Jessica Goodman of &quot;Glamour&quot; found that her 2016 song &quot;Remnants&quot; &quot;showcases the powerhouse vocals that made Rimes famous all those years ago.&quot;

===Influences===
Rimes has credited performers of different musical styles as career influences, including Alanis Morissette, Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand and Whitney Houston. Early in her career, Rimes commented on McEntire&#x27;s influence with &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;If I had to model my career after anyone it would have to be Reba. She&#x27;s made some great business decisions in her career to stay around for 20 years, and my biggest goal right now is to stay around for a long time.&quot;

Rimes was most notably influenced by Patsy Cline. Listeners and critics drew similarities to Cline&#x27;s voice through Rimes&#x27;s phrasing and vocal delivery Rimes later stated that Cline&#x27;s voice largely influenced the way she created her own unique sound. &quot;[Patsy Cline] was such a huge part of how I created my sound. From [Cline], really it was about this true, honest, emotional connection and the way that she could just take you to a place that you don&#x27;t normally go within yourself when you listened to her music,&quot; she told &quot;popculture.&quot; In 2013, Rimes performed a tribute to Cline at the American Country Awards she sang a tribute medley of Cline&#x27;s songs. &quot;I mean I know how much I&#x27;ve been influenced by her and how I feel about her and then you see a sea of people and artists who have been just as influenced and she&#x27;s touched so many people,&quot; she told &quot;E!&quot;.

===Musical styles===
Rimes has been categorized in the musical genres of country, pop, contemporary Christian, adult contemporary, pop rock, and dance-pop. Rimes began her career rooted in the country genre with her debut Curb release &quot;Blue&quot; and its subsequent country chart hits. Further releases such as &quot;How Do I Live&quot; and the album &quot;Sittin&#x27; on Top of the World&quot; demonstrated a more adult contemporary style. Rimes has also been described as a dance-pop artist, with releases such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; and the album &quot;Twisted Angel&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found that while she dabbled in many styles, Rimes was tied to the country genre: &quot;During the decade that separated &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Remnants&quot;, Rimes dabbled in pop, but she remained anchored in country music, regularly placing on Billboard&#x27;s Country Top 40 and occasionally landing a big hit.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===

In 1998, Rimes dated actor Andrew Keegan. When they first met, Rimes was 15 and Keegan was 19. The couple dated when Rimes and her father were involved in a lawsuit. In the same lawsuit, Rimes&#x27;s father claimed that Keegan was attempting to &quot;get his hands&quot; on Rimes&#x27;s finances. The relationship ended in 2001. According to press reports, Keegan became romantically interested in Rimes&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, Piper Perabo.

Shortly after the couple parted ways, Rimes met dancer Dean Sheremet at the 36th Academy of Country Music Awards in 2001. By December, the pair became engaged. In 2002 and at age 19, Rimes married Sheremet in a church ceremony in Dallas, Texas. In 2003, the couple purchased a 1.7 million dollar home, located in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2007, Sheremet directed the choreography for Rimes&#x27;s single &quot;Nothin&#x27; Better to Do&quot;. According to &quot;People&quot;, the couple spent more time apart in later years of their marriage as Rimes devoted energy towards an acting career in Los Angeles while Sheremet remained in Nashville. In July 2009, the couple separated and in September, Rimes announced their plans to divorce. The divorce was finalized on June 19, 2010, exactly six months after Sheremet filed divorce documents for dissolution of marriage.

Rimes began an extramarital affair with actor Eddie Cibrian, whom she worked with on the TV film &quot;Northern Lights&quot; Reports surfaced in March 2009 of the couple embracing while eating at a restaurant. Television personality Brandi Glanville, Cibrian&#x27;s then-wife and mother of his two sons, filed for divorce as a result of the affair in August 2009, ending eight years of marriage. In June 2010, Rimes spoke for the first time about the end of her first marriage, stating; &quot;I take responsibility for everything I&#x27;ve done. I hate that people got hurt, but I don&#x27;t regret the outcome.&quot; That month, Rimes moved into Cibrian&#x27;s California home. In an interview with ABC, Rimes discussed her new relationship: &quot;What happened is not who I am, period. But I do know how much I love him. So I&#x27;ve always said I don&#x27;t live my life with regret. I can&#x27;t.&quot; In December 2010, it was announced via &quot;Billboard&quot; that Rimes and Cibrian were engaged. Rimes and Cibrian married on April 22, 2011, at a private home in California. The 40-person ceremony also included Cibrian&#x27;s sons from his first marriage. In 2013, the couple bought a home in Hidden Hills, California, listed for three million dollars. By 2018, Rimes and Glanville reconciled, with Glanville stating: &quot;I think we both grew up quite a bit, and we both love Eddie&#x27;s parents. We both love the kids, and Eddie&#x27;s going to be in my life for the rest of my life. [...] We&#x27;re like sister wives. It&#x27;s me and LeAnn and Eddie.&quot;

===Family challenges and lawsuits===

From the beginning of Rimes&#x27; career, father Wilbur Rimes managed his daughter and served as producer on her records. In May 2000, Rimes and her mother sued Wilbur, alleging that he took more than seven million dollars of her income over the course of five years. The lawsuit claimed that money was being taken away from Rimes personally as well as from a management company that was founded back in 1995. The suit also included her former manager, Lyle Walker, who assisted her father in management duties. The suit was filed in a district court in Dallas, Texas. Rimes sought unspecified damages because her attorney was not sure of how much money had been lost in the preceding five years. In May 2001, she was informed by a Nashville court that she could not break her contract with Curb Records. Amidst the reaction, she visibly mouthed the words, &quot;I hate you&quot; to her father. When Rimes was 18, she filed a lawsuit against Curb Records on her own, successfully petitioning a court to remove her position as a &quot;minority&quot; on the recording contract. As a result, this change made the contract binding.

In 2002, Rimes&#x27;s lawsuit with her father was &quot;settled on undisclosed terms.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to express just how happy I am that all of the legal troubles between my daughter and I are over,&quot; Rimes&#x27;s father commented. Rimes reconciled with her father for her wedding. During her wedding ceremony to Dean Sheremet, Wilbur Rimes walked his daughter down the aisle. &quot;I&#x27;ve never hated my dad. I just wanted a dad. I guess I just really disliked where he was in my life. I just wanted him to be my father,&quot; she told ABC News.

===Health challenges===
In 2008, she opened up about her lifelong struggle with the autoimmune disease psoriasis. She participated in a PSA to raise awareness about the disease. In August 2012, one day after her birthday, Rimes checked into treatment for anxiety and stress. &quot;This is just a time for me to emotionally check out for a second and take care of myself and come back in 30 days as the best 30-year-old woman I can be,&quot; she explained. In March 2014, Rimes&#x27;s jaw became dislocated while performing, ending her concert encore early. Rimes attributed the dislocation to temporomandibular joint dysfunction, a disorder of the jaw joint and surrounding muscles. She has publicly posted about her struggles with this disorder via Twitter. In 2020, following a stress-related flare up of psoriasis, Rimes posed for a nude photo shoot for Glamour magazine as part of her efforts to raise awareness and acceptance about the disease on 2020 World Psoriasis Day (observed October 29). Later that year, she told &quot;People&quot; magazine that in addition to anxiety and stress, she was also suffering from depression in 2010: &quot;It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been very vocal about, because I feel like there&#x27;s so much stigma around it.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Rimes lent her voice to the 2008 song &quot;Just Stand Up&quot;. The proceeds benefited Stand Up to Cancer. As a result of SU2C fundraising endeavors, the SU2C scientific advisory committee, overseen by the American Association for Cancer Research, was able to award $73.6 million towards cancer research. In 2009, Rimes was given a special humanitarian award from the Academy of Country Music in honor of her philanthropic efforts. In December 2010, she performed &quot;The Rose&quot;, joined by The Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus of Los Angeles in remembrance of the many gay teenagers who committed suicide in 2010. On her weblog she wrote on June 18, 2011: &quot;I believe in equality for everyone. I believe everyone should have the right to love and commit to whomever they want. [...] All I know is that in God&#x27;s eyes we are all the same. I just wish we could see through the eyes of God more often.&quot; In 2017, Rimes revealed that her uncle was gay and died from the AIDS virus. &quot;Now, every time, everywhere I get to sing—or when I get stand up alongside my LGBTQ brothers and sisters—I get to give him a voice,&quot; she commented.

<text>Johannes Janssonius (1588, in Arnhem – buried July 11, 1664, in Amsterdam) (born Jan Janszoon, in English also Jan Jansson) was a Dutch cartographer and publisher who lived and worked in Amsterdam in the 17th century.

==Biography==

Janssonius was born in Arnhem, the son of Jan Janszoon the Elder, a publisher and bookseller. In 1612 he married Elisabeth de Hondt, the daughter of Jodocus Hondius and Colette van den Keere. He produced his first maps in 1616 of France and Italy. In 1623 Janssonius owned a bookstore in Frankfurt am Main, later also in Danzig, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin, Königsberg, Geneva and Lyon. His wife Elisabeth died in 1627 and he married Elisabeth Carlier in 1629. He formed a partnership with his brother in law Henricus Hondius, and together they published atlases as Mercator/Hondius/Janssonius.

Under the leadership of Janssonius the Hondius Atlas was steadily enlarged. Renamed &quot;Atlas Novus&quot;, it had three volumes in 1638, one fully dedicated to Italy. In 1646, a fourth volume came out with &quot;English County Maps&quot;, a year after a similar issue by Joan Blaeu. Janssonius&#x27; maps are similar to those of Blaeu, and he is often accused of copying from his rival, but many of his maps predate those of Blaeu and/or covered different regions. By 1660, at which point the atlas bore the appropriate name &quot;Atlas Major&quot;, there were 11 volumes, containing the work of about a hundred credited authors and engravers. It included a description of &quot;most of the cities of the world&quot; (Townatlas), of the waterworld (Atlas Maritimus in 33 maps), and of the Ancient World (60 maps). The eleventh volume was titled &quot;Atlas of the Heavens&quot; (a type of celestial cartography) by Andreas Cellarius. Editions were printed in Dutch, Latin, French, and a few times in German.

After Janssonius&#x27;s death, the publishing company was continued by his son-in law, Johannes van Waesbergen. The London bookseller Moses Pitt attempted publication of the Atlas Major in English, but ran out of resources after the fourth volume in 1683.

<text>Ertuğrul or Ertuğrul Ghazi (died ) was a 13th-century uch bey (marcher-lord), who was the father of Osman I. Little is known about Ertuğrul&#x27;s life. According to Ottoman tradition, he was the son of Suleyman Shah, the leader of the Kayı tribe (a claim which has come under criticism from many historians) of the Oghuz Turks (known as Turkomans by then). These Turkomans fled from western Central Asia to Anatolia to escape the Mongol conquests, but he may instead have been the son of Gündüz Alp. According to this legend, after the death of his father, Ertuğrul and his followers entered the service of the Sultanate of Rum, for which he was rewarded with dominion over the town of Söğüt on the frontier with the Byzantine Empire. This set off the chain of events that would ultimately lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire.

==Biography==
Nothing is known with certainty about Ertuğrul&#x27;s life, other than that he was the father of Osman; historians are thus forced to rely upon stories written about him by the Ottomans more than a century later, which are of questionable accuracy.

According to the sources written 100–150 years after the establishment of the Ottoman state, Ertuğrul&#x27;s lineage is traced to Noah, through Oghuz Khagan. Ottoman historian and ambassador to the Qara Qoyunlu, Şükrullah states that Ertuğrul&#x27;s lineage goes to Gökalp, a son of Oghuz Khagan. The author states that the information was shown during a court of Jahan Shah, from a book written in Mongolian script.

An undated coin, from the time of Osman, with the text &quot;Minted by Osman son of Ertuğrul&quot;, suggests that Ertuğrul was a historical figure. Another coin reads &quot;Osman bin Ertuğrul bin Gündüz Alp&quot;, though Ertuğrul is traditionally considered the son of Suleyman Shah.

In Enveri&#x27;s &quot;Düsturname&quot; (1465) and Karamani Mehmet Pasha&#x27;s chronicle (before 1481), Gündüz Alp is Ertugrul&#x27;s father. After Aşıkpaşazade&#x27;s chronicle &quot;Tevārīḫ-i Āl-i ʿOsmān&quot; (15th century), the Suleyman Shah version became the official one. 
According to many Turkish sources, Ertuğrul had three brothers named; Sungur-tekin, Gündoğdu and Dündar. After the death of their father, Ertuğrul with his mother Hayme Hatun, Dündar and his followers from the Kayı tribe migrated west into Anatolia and entered the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, leaving his two brothers who took their clans towards the east. In this way, the Kayı tribe was divided into two parts.
According to these later traditions, Ertuğrul was chief of his Kayı tribe.

As a result of his assistance to the Seljuks against the Byzantines, Ertuğrul was granted lands in Karaca Dağ, a mountainous area between Diyarbakır and Urfa, by Kayqubad I, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum. One account indicates that the Seljuk leader&#x27;s rationale for granting Ertuğrul land was for Ertuğrul to repel any hostile incursion from the Byzantines or other adversary. Later, he received the village of Söğüt which he conquered together with the surrounding lands. That village, where he later died, became the Ottoman capital under his son, Osman I. Osman&#x27;s mother has been referred to as Halime Hatun in later myths, and there is a grave outside the Ertuğrul Gâzi Tomb which bears the name, but it is disputed.

According to many sources, he had two other sons in addition to Osman I: Saru-Batu (Savci) Bey and Gündüz Bey. Like his son, Osman, and their descendants, Ertuğrul is often referred to as a &quot;Ghazi&quot;, a heroic champion fighter for the cause of Islam.
==Legacy==
A tomb and mosque dedicated to Ertuğrul is said to have been built by Osman I at Söğüt, but due to several rebuildings nothing certain can be said about the origin of these structures. The current mausoleum was built by Sultan Abdul Hamid II (r. 1876–1909) in the late 19th century. The town of Söğüt celebrates an annual festival to the memory of the early Osmans.

In 1826, Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment of the Ottoman Army was named in his honor.
The Ottoman frigate &quot;Ertuğrul&quot;, launched in 1863, was named after him. Abdul Hamid II also had a yacht with the same name. The Ertuğrul Tekke Mosque (late 19th century) in Istanbul, Turkey and the Ertuğrul Gazi Mosque in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan (completed in 1998), are also named in his honor. The mosque in Turkmenistan was established by the Turkish government as a symbol of the link between Turkey and Turkmenistan.

Ertuğrul is one of several statues that surround the Independence Monument in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. The statues depict people praised in the &quot;Ruhnama&quot;, a spiritual guide written by Turkmenistan president Saparmurat Niyazov. The Ertuğrul statue has also been depicted on a 2001 commemorative coin.

Two statues of Ertuğrul on horseback were placed by a private cooperative housing society in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2020. They were inspired by &quot;Diriliş: Ertuğrul&quot;, a 2014 TV series. A bust of Ertuğrul was erected in Ordu, Turkey, in 2020. However the bust was removed by local authorities after it was pointed out that it resembled the actor from the TV series.
===In fiction===

Ertugrul has been portrayed in the Turkish television series &quot;&quot; (1988), adapted from a novel by the same name, &quot;Diriliş: Ertuğrul&quot; (2014–2019) and the sequel &quot;Kuruluş: Osman&quot; (2019).

<text>Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici ( – February 1429) was an Italian banker and founder of the Medici Bank. While other members of the Medici family, such as Chiarissimo di Giambuono de&#x27; Medici, who served in the Signoria of Florence in 1401, and Salvestro de&#x27; Medici, who was implicated in the Ciompi Revolt of 1378, are of historical interest, it was Giovanni&#x27;s founding of the family bank that truly initiated the family&#x27;s rise to power in Florence. He was the father of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and of Lorenzo the Elder; grandfather of Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici; great-grandfather of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (the Magnificent); and the great-great-great-grandfather of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

==Biography==
Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici was born in Florence, Italy. He was the son of Averardo de&#x27; Medici and Jacopa Spini. His father, Averardo died in 1363 with a respectable amount of wealth. This inheritance was divided among Giovanni and his four brothers, leaving Giovanni with very little. However, his uncle, Vieri de&#x27; Medici, was still a prominent banker in Florence. Vieri helped Giovanni begin his career in the Florentine banking system. He worked his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming a junior partner in the branch located in Rome. Vieri de&#x27; Medici retired in 1393 leaving the bank in the hands of Giovanni. From this point the Medici bank grew vastly and quickly. This growth culminated with the acquisition as the Chief Papal Banker, which meant that the Medici Bank now handled the accounts of the Church. The Medici family bank, which he founded in 1397, became his main commercial interest. The Medici bank under Giovanni had branches throughout the northern Italian city-states and beyond, and constituted an early &quot;multi-national&quot; company.

Giovanni owned two wool workshops in Florence, and was a member of two guilds: the &quot;Arte della Lana&quot; and the &quot;Arte del Cambio&quot;. In 1402, he served as one of the judges on the panel that selected Lorenzo Ghiberti&#x27;s design for the bronzes on the doors to the Florence Baptistery. Giovanni also funded the construction of the sacristy in the Church of San Lorenzo in the year 1418. He picked Brunelleschi to be the architect and chose Donatello to create the sculptures. These are just a few of the many contributions that Giovanni made to the art world.

In 1414, Giovanni bet on the permanent return of the papacy to Rome after a long period of exile and schism, and was correct; the papacy was permanently installed in Rome in 1417 under a single pope after the deliberations of the Council of Constance. Rewarding Giovanni for his support, Pope Martin V gave Giovanni&#x27;s general manager control of the Apostolic Chamber. Subsequent popes also made use of the services of the Medici banks, and in addition, Giovanni was able to secure tax-farming contracts and the rights to many alum mines from the papacy. He set his family on the path to becoming one of the richest dynasties in Europe, thereby making an essential stride towards its later cultural and political prominence. One way in which he laid the groundwork for this was by marrying Piccarda Bueri, whose old and respectable family brought him a large dowry.

In 1418, Giovanni Medici collaborated with one of Florence&#x27;s chief nobles, Niccolò da Uzzano, to secure the release of the deposed Antipope John XXIII, who was imprisoned in Germany. De Medici paid the stiff ransom of 38,000 ducats himself, and when the former pope died the following year in Florence, de Medici sponsored the construction of his magnificent tomb in the Baptistery.

Despite his growing wealth, Giovanni was diligent in his efforts not to separate the Medici family from the other citizens in Florence. He did so by continuously ensuring that he and his sons dressed and behaved like the average working-class citizens of Florence. This was in part due to his desire not to draw undue attention to himself and his family, and to ensure that, unlike other wealthy families, the Medici remained in the favour of the population. His hopes were to build a positive reputation of his family by avoiding conflicts with the law and keeping the people of Florence happy. His disposition can be understood in his writings, &quot;Strive to keep the people at peace, and the strong places well cared for. Engage in no legal complications, for he who impedes the law shall perish by the law. Do not draw public attention on yourselves yet keep free from blemish as I leave you.&quot;

===Political activity===
Giovanni stayed at arms length from politics for much of his life, but he was urged to reluctantly accept various positions of high office throughout his life in the Signoria of Florence because of the prestige and universal popularity he enjoyed in the city. His attitude is exemplified in his writings to his son Cosimo, saying, &quot;Do not make the government-house your work shop, but wait until you are called to it, then show your selves obedient.&quot; He served as a &quot;Priore&quot; in the Signoria in 1402, 1408, and 1411 and as a &quot;Gonfaloniere&quot; for the statutory two-month period in 1421. In 1407, he also served as the governor of the city of Pistoia.

In the sphere of politics, Giovanni stayed true to his reputation and the tradition of the Medici family as champions of the people and intractable opponents of the nobility of Florence. In 1426, he exerted his considerable personal influence in the Signoria to replace Florence&#x27;s inequitable and oppressive poll tax with the &quot;Catasto&quot;. This was a particular property tax devised by Giovanni wherein the tax burden was shifted from the poorer classes in Florence, making it more difficult for the nobility to evade their share. The following year he once again wielded his personal authority and influence in the Signoria to block the passage of oligarchic reforms proposed by the nobility, which would have repealed the ban on nobles serving in the Signoria, and removed some of the lesser guilds from being represented there.

==Issue==
By his wife Piccarda Bueri, he had five children:
*Cosimo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (1389–1464). Pater Patriae and Lord of Florence, grandfather of Lorenzo the Magnificent. 
*Damiano di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (d.1390). Most probably Cosimo&#x27;s twin, died young.
*Lorenzo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (1395–1440). Progenitor of the &quot;Popolare&quot; branch of the family, the Grand Ducal line will descend from him.
*Antonio di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (born c. 1398). Died young. 
*A daughter whose name is unknown. She died at her marriage&#x27;s eve. 

==Legacy==
When he died, di Bicci was one of the wealthiest men in Florence, as shown by his tax report of 1429. It was reported that upon his death, he was the second richest man in Florence, leaving an abundance of wealth to his son Cosimo. This wealth and banking system led to Cosimo becoming one of the wealthiest men in Europe. Also upon his death, he had become a favorite amongst the Florentine public, with even professional rival Niccolò da Uzzano. Niccolò states in a letter to Giovanni&#x27;s sons that he had made the family beloved by the people and positioned them for great success. In 1420, Giovanni had given the majority of control of the bank to his two sons, Cosimo and Lorenzo. Upon his death in 1429, he was buried in the Old Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, and his wife was buried with him after her death four years later.

==Fictional depictions==
Giovanni de&#x27; Medici is portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the 2016 television series &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="215659" wikidata="Q7714390" url="?curid=215659" title="The Art Institute of Seattle">
<text>The Art Institute of Seattle was a private for-profit art school in Seattle, Washington. The school was one of a number of Art Institutes, a franchise of for-profit art colleges with many branches in North America, owned and operated by Education Management Corporation. EDMC owned the college from 1982 until 2017, when, facing significant financial problems and declining enrollment, the company sold the Art Institute of Seattle, along with 30 other Art Institute schools, to Dream Center Education, a Los Angeles–based Pentecostal organization, before shuttering.

The Dream Center Foundation acquired the school in 2018 and laid off ten of its thirteen full-time teachers in October 2018. The Washington Student Achievement Council then suspended Ai-Seattle&#x27;s license to operate, which blocked enrollment of new students.

The school closed permanently on March 8, 2019, with 650 students unable to finish the winter quarter. Students were forced to retrieve paper copies of their documents during the last day and were offered scholarships and classes from other nearby universities, including Seattle Pacific University.

== History ==
The Art Institute of Seattle was located in several buildings near the Elliott Bay waterfront in the Belltown neighborhood of Downtown Seattle, near many of the city&#x27;s design studios, restaurants and corporate offices. It was founded in 1946 as the Burnley School for Art and was renamed in 1982.

In 1946, Edwin Burnley founded the Burnley School of Art and Design and opened the doors at the end of World War II in 1947. In the late 1940s, the Burnley school of Art and Design changed its name to The Burnley School of Professional Art. In 1959, Jess Cauthorn bought the school from Edwin Burnley. The school was run and owned privately by Jess Cauthorn and his wife until 1982 when Jess Cauthorn sold the school to the Education Management Corporation and the school&#x27;s name became The Art Institute of Seattle. Jess Cauthorn also became the President of the school that year. In 1984, the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology accredited the Art Institute of Seattle. Also in that year, Jess Cauthorn stepped down as the Art Institute of Seattle&#x27;s president and on May 23, George Pry became the new President of the Art Institute of Seattle. It became part of The Art Institutes and changed its name to The Art Institute of Seattle in 1982. In fall of 1985, the school became fully accredited by the National Association of Trade &amp; Technical Schools; the school also moved from its address at 905 E. Pine to its current location on the waterfront of Seattle at 2323 Elliott Avenue. In 1986, the Art Institute of Seattle was one of eight schools among the Art Institutes. In October 1989, George Pry left the school and Hal Griffith took his place. Hal Griffith was at the school for a period of thirteen months. In November 1990, David Pauldine became the new school President. David Pauldine left in December 1993 and was replaced temporarily by Lew Bender. In February 1994 Less Pritchard became the President of the Art Institute of Seattle. In 1999, Timothy Schutz became President of the school and The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities granted regional accreditation to the school. In 2003, Shelly Dubois became president. In 2006, the school was granted accreditation at a baccalaureate level to offer programs leading to the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. In 2009, Barbara Singer became the President of the Art Institute of Seattle followed by Elden Monday in 2010.

<doc id="215661" wikidata="Q380764" url="?curid=215661" title="Sukhothai province">
<text>Sukhothai (, ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;); it lies in lower northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are Phrae, Uttaradit, Phitsanulok, Kamphaeng Phet, Tak, and Lampang. Sukhothai can be translated as &#x27;dawn of happiness&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The modern-day province of Sukhothai was named after the Sukhothai Kingdom that once ruled the area, which in turn borrowed its name from the Sanskrit terms &quot;sukha&quot; ( &#x27;happiness&#x27;) + &quot;udaya&quot; ( &#x27;rise&#x27;, &#x27;emergence&#x27;), meaning &#x27;dawn of happiness&#x27;.

==Geography==
Sukhothai is in the valley of the Yom River in the lower north of Thailand. The provincial capital, Sukhothai Thani is north of Bangkok and south of Chiang Mai. The province covers .

The Khao Luang Mountain Range, with its four main peaks: Khao Phu Kha, Khao Phra Mae Ya, Khao Chedi, and Pha Narai, lies within the Ramkhamhaeng National Park in the south of the province. Si Satchanalai National Park is in the northwest, protecting the mountainous forest areas of the Phi Pan Nam Range at the northern end of the province. The total forest area is or 29.6 percent of provincial area.

The two national parks, along with six other national parks, make up region 14 (Tak) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Ramkhamhaeng National Park, 
* Si Satchanalai National Park, 

There is one wildlife sanctuary, along with three other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 14 (Tak) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Tham Chao Ram Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==

Sukhothai was a town founded in the 13th century on the fringe of the Khmer empire. The exact year is unknown, but according to the Fine Arts Office it was between 1238 and 1257. Founded by Phokhun Si Intharathit, it was the first truly independent Thai (Siamese) Kingdom after defeating the Khmers. Sukhothai enjoyed a golden age under their third king, King Ramkhamhaeng, who was credited with creating the Khmer-derived Thai alphabet which is essentially the same as that in use today. He also laid the foundation for politics, the monarchy and religion, as well as expanding its circle of influence. Sukhothai was later ruled by many kings. The province is most known for the historic city of Sukhothai, the capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom. It is about 12 km from the modern New Sukhothai city. Not far from Sukhothai are the Si Satchanalai Historical Park and the Kamphaeng Phet Historical Park. Both were cities in the former Sukhothai kingdom and at the same time period.
Sukhothai Kingdom was merged into Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1438.

The province was at first known as Sawankhalok; it was renamed to Sukhothai in 1939.

==Language==
The inhabitants of Sukhothai still speak the Sukhothai dialect of Thai, a language that has been spoken since the formation of the Sukhothai Kingdom, some 700 years ago, among themselves. The Sukhothai dialect is distinct from Central Thai in both tone and vocabulary and is thought to be similar to proto-Tai in tone structure, an ancestor to the modern Thai language. The inhabitants of Si Satchanalai and Thung Saliam Districts in the northern part of the province mainly speak &quot;Kham Muang&quot; (also known as Northern Thai language or Lan Na).

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows King Ram Khamhaeng the Great sitting on the Managkhasila Asana throne. Under King Ramkhamhaeng the kingdom of Sukhothai flourished.

The provincial tree is &quot;Afzelia xylocarpa&quot;. The provincial flower is the Lotus (&quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is the ghost shetfish (&quot;Kryptopterus vitreolus&quot;) according to local legend about Phra Ruang, the one with sacred speech. 

The provincial slogan is &quot;Source of national heritage and pride, birth place of the Thai alphabet, fireworks of the Loy Krathong festival, preservation of Buddhism, the fine Teen Jok cloth, ancient golden chinaware, holy image of Ramkhamhaeng the Great&#x27;s mother, the dawn of happiness&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into nine districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 86 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 782 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

<text>Simmering (; ) is the 11th district of Vienna, Austria (). It borders the Danube and was established as a district in 1892. Simmering has several churches, some museums, schools, old castles, and four cemeteries, one of them being the Wiener Zentralfriedhof, one of the largest cemeteries of Europe.

== History ==

The first indications of the settlement &quot;Simmering&quot; are from 1028. A brewery was built in 1605 and continued to bring in revenue for the area for more than 300 years. Simmering remained small until 1860, when the &quot;Rinnböckhäuser&quot; housing development was built, which at the time was the second-largest in Vienna, and resulted in rapid growth in the area.

&quot;Kaiserebersdorf&quot; (earlier known as &quot;Ebersdorf&quot;) was one of the original villages in the district and held the residence of the &quot;Ebendorfer&quot; dynasty. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II hunted frequently in the area and converted the residence into the hunting lodge Schloss Neugebäude.

On January 1, 1892, Simmering, Kaiserebersdorf, and some very small parts of Kledering, Schwechat, and Albern were incorporated into Vienna as the 11th district.

The first indications of the small town of &quot;Albern&quot; originate from 1162. The town was small throughout its history. It had to be moved and resettled twice due to flooding from the Danube. On October 15, 1938, the town was moved to the former 23rd district of Schwechat. But after World War II, it was moved to the 2nd district Leopoldstadt so that its refineries would belong to the Soviet-occupied quarter of Vienna. In 1955, in the Austrian State Treaty it became part of Simmering.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms for the 11th district has three parts, each representing one of the former villages that were united to form the district. The silver &quot;S&quot; on a blue background stands for the former village of Simmering. The rearing unicorn on a golden background stands for Kaiserebersdorf and comes from the coat of arms of the Herr von Hintperg-Ebersdorf, who founded the settlement. The third part shows the symbol of the former village of Albern. The crossed fish on red background are reminiscent of the fishing tradition that was important to the people of Albern.

== Geography ==

The district lies in the southern part of Vienna. It borders the Danube and Danube Canal to the east and the &quot;East railway&quot; to the west. Of all the districts, Simmering is the lowest district in terms of elevation.

== Transportation ==
Simmering has always been on important transport routes to the south and east. These include the following: 
*Simmering was crossed by the Wiener Neustadt Canal, which has fallen into disuse around Simmering.
*Many railway lines pass through Simmering, such as the East railway, the railway to Aspang, and many industrial lines.
*Albern is home to a harbour for cereals on the River Danube.
*The high street in Simmering dates back to a Roman road. 
*The motorway A4 to Vienna International Airport and on to Hungary starts in Simmering.

== Politics ==

Simmering was a stronghold for social democrats as early as the start of the 20th century. In the district vote of 1919, the social democrats won 21 positions in the district government, with the Christian Social Party taking the next largest vote with only 7 seats and the &quot;Tschechische Liste&quot; (literally &quot;Czech list&quot;) taking 2 seats.
The social democrats of Simmering and of the rest of the so-called &quot;Rotes Wien&quot; (Red Vienna) pushed to build housing developments throughout Vienna and in 1934, 19 &quot;Gemeindebauten&quot; were built in Simmering.

The rise of Nazism in Vienna was hardly acknowledged in the vote of Simmering, as the party took only 7.2% of the vote in 1932, the worst outcome in the whole city. Even after 1945, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) continued to dominate the votes. In the mid-1990s, the SPÖ fell from 59% to 48% of the vote and lost their majority, with the Freedom Party (FPÖ) gaining support to 31% of the vote. The trend reversed itself in 2001, and the SPÖ retook 59.22% of the vote, FPÖ took 21.37%, Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) had 9.82%, the Greens had 6.77%, and the Liberal Forum barely took a seat with 2.02% of the vote. In 2005, the SPÖ improved their result slightly to 60.7%, before losing the absolute majority with a loss of 11% at the following election in 2010, finishing with 49.2% of the vote. The ÖVP and Greens also lost voters, while the FPÖ nearly doubled their share of the vote to 34.2%. In 2015, the SPÖ lost the relative majority to the FPÖ. Simmering is the first Viennese district with an FPÖ district director.

== Infrastructure ==
The 11th district has always been known for its industries. In the 19th century, Simmering generated and supplied the electricity for the &quot;Straßenbahnen&quot; (trams) of Vienna and also had a gas works to supply the city with town gas for its lights. The gas works produced natural gas from 1899 to 1978, but today serves as a distribution post for natural gas brought in. There were huge 70-meter tall gas tanks on the premises, called the Gasometer (featured in the James Bond film The Living Daylights). Reconstruction in 2001 converted the structures from containers to buildings that today house apartments, offices, a shopping centre, and a cinema. The towers of the Gasometer have ranked next to the Zentralfriedhof as a landmark of the 11th district.

The district also hosts other municipal infrastructure, including the EBS (special material recycling center), a sewage treatment facility that treats about 90% of the city&#x27;s sewage, and also a juvenile detention center.

== Gardens ==

Simmering is home to many large undeveloped stretches of greenery and fields full of vegetable gardens that provide produce for the city.

== Industry ==
Many industries call Simmering home, including Simmering-Graz-Pauker (SGP, rail car manufacturer), Steyr (armory, weapons, and military vehicle manufacturer), Hoerbiger (compression valve manufacturer, founded by Hanns Hörbiger), and other companies in the electrical and pharmaceutical industries.

== Cultural and medial reflection ==
1979 Simmering, a poetic documentary film about Simmering was released by Alexander Schukoff and Reinhard Kofler. Prior to her death, Russian-American cultural theorist Svetlana Boym worked on the short film &quot;Remembering Forgetting&quot; based on her time at the transit refugee camp for Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union in 1981, for which she interviewed Schukoff and other Jewish intellectuals who stayed at the camp. Among them were Masha Gessen, Vitaly Komar, Anton Vidokle, and Regina Spektor. The film debuted in 2016.

<text>MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks () is a sandstone and siltstone mountain range in the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. Stretching , from the Gap of Dunloe in the east, to Glencar in the west, the Reeks is Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain range, and includes most of the highest peaks and sharpest ridges in Ireland, and the only peaks on the island over in height.

Near the centre of the range is Carrauntoohil, Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain at . The range was heavily glaciated which carved out deep corries (e.g. the Eagle&#x27;s Nest), U-shaped valleys (e.g. Lough Coomloughra), and sharp arêtes and ridges (e.g. the Beenkeragh Ridge).

The range, part of the Reeks District, is a destination for mountain walkers and climbers and includes some of Ireland&#x27;s most regarded walking routes such as the 15–kilometre &quot;Coomloughra Horseshoe&quot;, and the 26-kilometre &quot;MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks Ridge Walk&quot; that traverses the full range; it is estimated that over 140,000 people visit the range each year. The entire range is in private ownership; however, reasonable access is given for recreational use.

==Geology==

MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks are composed of sandstone particles of various sizes, which are collectively known as the Old Red Sandstone. The rocks date from the Upper Devonian period (310–450 million years ago) when Ireland was in a hot equatorial setting. During this 60 million year period, Ireland was the site of a major basin, known as the Munster basin, and the counties of Cork and Kerry were effectively a large alluvial floodplain. Chemical oxidation stained the material with a purple–reddish colour (and green in places from chlorination), still visible today. There are virtually no fossils in Old Red Sandstone. The composition of Old Red Sandstone is variable and contains quartz stones, mudstones, siltstones, and sandstone particles (boulders of conglomerate rock containing quartz pebbles are visible throughout the range). The Reeks were also subject to significant glaciation which led to fracturing of the rock, and resulted in deep corries (e.g. the Eagle&#x27;s Nest), U-shaped valleys (e.g. Lough Coomloughra), and sharp arêtes and ridges (e.g. the Beenkeragh Ridge).

==Geography==
MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks are variously described as consisting of two main sections, containing all ten of the Reeks that are above 3,000 ft:

The Eastern Reeks meet the Coomloughea Reeks at the col of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, a popular ascent route for Carrauntoohil.

MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks contains the three peaks in Ireland which are over in height, namely: Carrauntoohil, Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain at , followed by Beenkeragh at and Caher at .

The range contains eleven of the fourteen peaks in Ireland that are over in height, and meet the Vandeleur-Lynam classification of a mountain—peaks with a prominence over . All but one of these eleven 3,000 ft peaks, namely Cnoc an Chuillinn East Top, are amongst the list of thirteen Irish Furths—peaks which meet the Scottish Mountaineering Club&#x27;s criteria for a Munro, and they are therefore also known as &quot;Irish Munros&quot;.

There are 29 peaks in the range above in height. The range contains 14 Irish Hewitts (height above 2,000 ft and prominence above 30 metres), and 16 Irish Arderins (height above 500 metres and prominence above 30 metres). The range is also known for its sharp aretes, including The Bones arete, more famously known as the &quot;Beenkeragh Ridge&quot;, and The Big Gun arete.

A feature of the range is the modest topographic prominence, or &quot;drop&quot; between many of its peaks. Only two of the eleven Reeks over 3,000 ft meet the Marilyn classification of a mountain (a prominence above 150 metres), namely Carrauntoohil and Cnoc na Péiste. The only Reek that meets the P600 classification (a prominence above 600 metres), is Carrauntoohil itself. The combination of high peaks and low prominence, means the ridges between the peaks are at a sustained height (e.g. why the prominence is so modest), which has contributed to the popularity of ridge walking in the Reeks, particularly, the &quot;Coomloughra Horseshoe&quot;, and the &quot;MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks Ridge Walk&quot;, and the term, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain range&quot;.

==Ownership==

The entire range is held in private ownership, both in individually owned freehold parcels in the lower reaches and in commonly owned, open upland zones (&#x27;commonage&#x27;). A State-sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled &quot;MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment&quot; (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles. Unlike many other national mountain ranges, the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure.

The private ownership has led to issues around the upkeep of popular paths in the Reeks, most particularly the erosion of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Ladder&quot; path, which is used to summit Carrauntoohil; and various car-parks and bridges used by climbers. The 2013 MAP report noted the importance of safety in light of the increasing climbers and walkers to the Reeks. The MAP report stated that Kerry Mountain Rescue (&quot;KMR&quot;) logged 17 fatalities on the Reeks between 1966 and 2000, or about one every second year, but since 2000, KMR had been logging approximately 2 fatalities per annum.

In 2019 the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported that the &quot;MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Forum&quot;, a cross-body group of landowners, commercial users and public access and walking groups set up in 2014 with the aim of &quot;protecting, managing and sustainably developing the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks mountain range, while halting and reversing the obvious and worsening path erosion&quot;, had achieved some success laying down new pathways in the &quot;Hag&#x27;s Glen&quot; approach to Carrauntoohil; however, the Irish Times still wondered, &quot;Should the Kerry reeks be a national park?&quot;.

==Naming==

The full name of the range in Irish is &quot;Cruacha Dubha Mhic Giolla Mo Chuda&quot;, meaning &quot;the black stacks of McGillycuddy&quot;. This is commonly shortened to &quot;Na Cruacha Dubha&quot;. The name is translated into English as &quot;MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks&quot;, where &quot;reek&quot; is a Hiberno-English form of the word &quot;&quot;, denoting a stack.

The MacGillycuddys () were a sept, or branch, of the O&#x27;Sullivan Moore clan. The MacGillycuddy is recorded as being one of a smaller number of Gaelic chieftains whose lands were returned post the Cromwellian confiscations, which explains why the name survives to this day. The MacGillycuddy family tomb is at Kilgobnet, County Kerry, between the mountains and Killorglin. The clan chief, McGillycuddy of the Reeks, owned land in this part of Munster until the end of the 20th century.

==Recreation==

===Visitors===

Jim Ryan&#x27;s 2006 book on the Reeks, &quot;Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks: A Walking Guide to Ireland&#x27;s Highest Mountains&quot;, stated that there were 25,000 annual visitors to the Reeks. The 2013 MAP report quoted Ryan&#x27;s figures, which were cited in the MAP&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Reference&quot;, but stated that: &quot;The Reeks are accessed by at least 25,000 recreational users per annum. It is highly likely that the numbers are a factor of 4 times higher based on observation of the year-round level of usage – but data is required to ascertain the visitor numbers.&quot; It was estimated that 125,000 visitors entered the range in 2017 from footfall at three main access points, and that 140,000 entered in 2018 by recording footfall at four main access points. The Reeks are a popular subject for artists and photographers, with souvenir prints offered for sale among &quot;Views of Ireland.&quot;

===Hill walking===

The most common reason for visiting the Reeks is to climb Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain, Carrauntoohil. The popular route starts from Cronin&#x27;s Yard () and enters the Hag&#x27;s Glen to climb the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (the col between Carrauntoohil and Cnoc na Toinne), from which the summit is accessed. A more challenging route is via the &quot;Hag&#x27;s Tooth Ridge&quot; which circles the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;, and takes in Beenkeragh, and the &quot;Beenkeragh Ridge&quot;.

MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks is particularly regarded for the quality of its ridge walking routes, with the 6–8 hour &quot;Coomloughra Horseshoe&quot;, that circles Lough Coomloughra, considered &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s classic ridge walks&quot;, which takes in all three of Ireland&#x27;s peaks, namely, Carrauntoohil, Beenkeragh, and Caher (East Top and West Top), as well as the famous &quot;Beenkeragh Ridge&quot;.

The most challenging route is the full &quot;MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks Ridge Walk&quot;, a 12- to 14-hour, traverse of the entire range. The route normally starts at the eastern end from &quot;Kate Kearney&#x27;s Cottage&quot; in the Gap of Dunloe. The route takes in Stickeen Mountain () and Cnoc an Bhráca () before reaching the ridge proper at Cruach Mhór (). From there it continues along the narrow arete of The Big Gun () to Cnoc na Péiste (), and continuing along the chain of Maolán Buí (), Cnoc an Chuillinn (), Cnoc na Toinne () to the summit of Carrauntoohil ().

From Carrauntoohil, a number of variations are possible, the main one being a detour to Beenkeragh () before returning along the same route to get to Caher () and then on to Caher West Top () before descending to the &quot;Hydro-Track&quot; () car park near Lough Acoose, Glencar.

An alternative variation is to continue from Beenkeragh on the northern side of the &quot;Coomloughra Horseshoe&quot; to the peaks or Skregmore () and Cnoc Íochtair () before descending to the &quot;Hydro-Track&quot; car park.

===Rock and winter climbing===

MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks are not especially known for their rock-climbing routes, unlike Ailladie in Clare or Fair Head in Antrim. The rock climbing grade Very Difficult (V-Diff), &quot;Howling Ridge&quot; up the central arete between the east and north-east faces of Carrauntoohil is notable. The north-east face of Carrauntoohil (e.g. the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; area), is better known for its winter climbing, conditions permitting, offering 80 routes with 7 up to winter Grade V.

<text>Kimberly Denise Jones (born July 11, 1974), better known by her stage name Lil&#x27; Kim, is an American rapper. She was born and raised in New York City and lived much of her adolescent life on the streets after being expelled from home. In her teens, she would freestyle rap, influenced by fellow female hip-hop artists like MC Lyte and the Lady of Rage. In 1994, she was discovered by fellow rapper the Notorious B.I.G., who invited her to join his group Junior M.A.F.I.A.; their debut album, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; generated two top 20 singles in the United States and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Hard Core&quot; (1996) was certified double platinum in March 2001. Since its release, it has sold more than six million copies worldwide and spawned three successful singles: &quot;No Time&quot;, &quot;Not Tonight (Ladies Night)&quot;, and &quot;Crush on You&quot;. &quot;Hard Core&quot; had the highest debut in the US for a female rap album at the time. Her following albums, &quot;The Notorious K.I.M.&quot; (2000) and &quot;La Bella Mafia&quot; (2003) were also certified platinum. In 2001, Lil&#x27; Kim reached number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (a remake of LaBelle&#x27;s 1974 single), alongside Christina Aguilera, Mýa, and Pink. The song also won her the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Other notable singles from this period include &quot;The Jump Off&quot; and &quot;Magic Stick&quot;, the latter of which reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming her 2nd-highest-charting single as a lead artist.

In 2005, Lil&#x27; Kim served a one-year prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends&#x27; involvement in a shooting four years earlier. During her incarceration, her fourth album, &quot;The Naked Truth,&quot; was released to positive reviews from critics. A reality series covering her sentence, &quot;Lil&#x27; Kim: Countdown to Lockdown,&quot; premiered on BET in 2006. She then released her first mixtape, &quot;Ms. G.O.A.T.&quot; (2008) and returned to the public eye in 2009 with an appearance on &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot; Throughout the 2010s, she continued to release music and perform sporadically, collaborating with artists such as Faith Evans, Remy Ma, and Fabolous. Her fifth studio album, &quot;9,&quot; was released in 2019.

Lil&#x27; Kim has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of Rap&quot;, as well as her alias &quot;Queen Bee&quot; by several media outlets. She has sold more than 15 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide. Her songs &quot;No Time&quot;, &quot;Big Momma Thang&quot;, and &quot;Not Tonight (Ladies Night)&quot; were each listed on &quot;Complex&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 Best Rap Songs By Women. In 2012, she was listed on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women in Music list at number 45, the second-highest position for a solo female hip-hop artist. 

Aside from music, she is also known for her risk-taking and luxurious approach to fashion which has inspired many artists; she has been cited as a fashion icon. Her collaboration with celebrity nail artist Bernadette Thompson for the 1999 &quot;Money Nails&quot; design she wore is credited with bringing intricate nail art into mainstream fashion and has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art. Lil&#x27; Kim has been noted for helping women embrace their &quot;sexuality and femininity&quot; in a way that was a stark contrast at the time from other female artists.

== Early life, family and education ==
Jones was born in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, the second child of Linwood Jones, a former U.S. Marine. She has an older brother, Christopher. As a child, Jones attended Queen of All Saints Elementary School in Brooklyn. When she was nine years old, her parents separated, and Jones was raised by her father, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. At fourteen, she left home, began living on the streets, and ultimately dropped out of high school.

As a teenager, Jones met Christopher Wallace, known professionally as the Notorious B.I.G. Wallace was a key figure in both her personal and artistic life, particularly after he gained popularity and influence through his relationship with Bad Boy Records. Jones attended Sarah J. Hale Vocational High School for two-and-a-half years. She and her friends often skipped school. As she was not completing her schoolwork, the decision was made for her to transfer to Brooklyn College Academy to finish her remaining year and a half of high school.

== Career ==
In 1994, B.I.G. was instrumental in introducing and promoting the Brooklyn-based group Junior M.A.F.I.A. Jones, who had adopted the stage name Lil&#x27; Kim, was a member of the group. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; was released to mediocre reviews and moderate sales on August 29, 1995, but debuted at number eight on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 69,000 copies in its first week of release. Wallace wrote and ghostwrote most of the album&#x27;s material. Three hit singles came from &quot;Conspiracy&quot;: &quot;Player&#x27;s Anthem&quot;, &quot;I Need You Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Get Money“. The RIAA certified &quot;Conspiracy&quot; a Gold album on December 6, 1995. &quot;Player&#x27;s Anthem&quot; and &quot;Get Money&quot; were certified gold and platinum respectively. Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s increasing popularity as a member of Junior M.A.F.I.A. allowed her to start a solo career shortly after the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; album was released. By late 1995, she began working on what would become her debut album, &quot;Hard Core.&quot;

=== 1996–2002: &quot;Hard Core&quot; and &quot;The Notorious K.I.M.&quot; ===
After a year with Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil&#x27; Kim began her solo career by making guest performances on R&amp;B albums and recording her debut album, &quot;Hard Core&quot;, which was released in November 1996. The album debuted at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest debut for a female rap album at that time, and number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling 78,000 copies in its first week of release and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA on March 14, 2001, after having been certified gold on January 6, 1997, and platinum on June 3, 1997.

The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;No Time&quot;, a duet with Combs, reached the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Tracks chart and was certified gold by the RIAA. The following single was &quot;Crush on You&quot;, a remixed version of the track that appeared on Hard Core. A remix of the album&#x27;s track &quot;Not Tonight&quot; saw Lil&#x27; Kim team up with Missy Elliott, Angie Martinez, Da Brat, and Left Eye of TLC with the song peaking at 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was part of the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence movie &quot;Nothing to Lose,&quot; nominated for a Grammy Award, and certified platinum. She became the first female rapper to have three consecutive number ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Tracks chart.

In one stockholders&#x27; meeting of Warner Bros. Records, activist C. Delores Tucker criticized the label &quot;for producing this filth&quot;, referring to perceived graphic sexual content in Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s lyrics, and labeling them &quot;gangsta porno rap“. In 1997, Lil&#x27; Kim promoted &quot;Hard Core&quot; by performing on P. Diddy&#x27;s &quot;No Way Out&quot; tour. The tour continued through to 1998 and became one of the highest-grossing hip-hop tours of all time, grossing an estimated $16 million. That same year, she launched her own label, Queen Bee Entertainment.

From 1998 to 2000, Lil&#x27; Kim continued working under the management of B.I.G.&#x27;s best friend, Damion &quot;D-Roc&quot; Butler&#x27;s &quot;Roc Management&quot;, touring and modeling for various fashion and pop culture companies including Candie&#x27;s, Versace, Iceberg, and Baby Phat. 

In 1999, for a denim campaign fashion shoot, Lil&#x27; Kim debuted &quot;Money Nails&quot; designed by nail artist Bernadette Thompson. Thompson gave Lil&#x27; Kim a manicure with acrylic nails and pieces of an actual $100 bill. The look became an instant trendsetter spawning a wave of imitation looks and a trending search topic on Google (at a time before the internet was ubiquitous). 

Her outfit at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards received widespread media attention, fueled by the &quot;shocked&quot; response of presenter Diana Ross, who approached and jiggled Kim&#x27;s exposed breast on national television. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered that the incident solidified Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;image of sexual fearlessness&quot; and her career as &quot;a fashion trendsetter“. 

On June 27, 2000, Lil&#x27; Kim released her second album, &quot;The Notorious K.I.M.&quot; The album marked a new image and revamped look for the rapper. Despite the limited success of its singles, the album debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 229,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, four weeks after its release. It was on this LP that the well-known hip-hop feud between Lil&#x27; Kim and Foxy Brown escalated. In 2001, Lil&#x27; Kim teamed up with Christina Aguilera, Pink, and Mýa to remake &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, which was originally written about a bordello in New Orleans and performed by the group Labelle (which included diva Patti LaBelle) 25 years earlier.

The song was recorded for the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; film soundtrack, released in April 2001, and stayed at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five weeks. The song also went to number 1 in 14 countries around the world. This was a major accomplishment for female rap, as well as for Lil&#x27; Kim, who scored her first and only number 1 Hot 100 hit and became the second solo female rapper in history to hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; also garnered Lil&#x27; Kim her first Grammy Award. The second single, &quot;Kimnotyze&quot;, was released as the lead single of record producer DJ Tomekk&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Beat Of Life, Vol 1.&quot; It was released in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany only. The song was successful, becoming Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s third consecutive top 10 hit in Germany after her number 5 hit &quot;Lady Marmalade“.

In 2002, Lil&#x27; Kim recorded a new entrance theme for then World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Women&#x27;s Champion Trish Stratus entitled &quot;Time to Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, which was used during broadcasts, until Stratus&#x27;s retirement. The single was released on &quot;WWE Anthology,&quot; a compilation of entrance theme music to various professional wrestling superstars. Lil&#x27; Kim released the song &quot;What&#x27;s The Word&quot; in mid-2002. Despite not having an official release, it went on to peak at number 9 on the Bubbling Under R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. It would later be released on the Japan edition of her third studio album, La Bella Mafia, as a bonus track.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;La Bella Mafia&quot; ===
On March 4, 2003, Lil&#x27; Kim released her third studio album, &quot;La Bella Mafia.&quot; It debuted at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 166,000 copies in its first week, giving Lil&#x27; Kim her second consecutive top 5 album. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, receiving a score of 65 on Metacritic. A buzz single, &quot;Came Back For You&quot;, was released ahead of the album, the music video for the song featured reality television personality Victoria Gotti.

The first single, &quot;The Jump Off&quot;, featuring Mr. Cheeks, peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Follow up single, &quot;Magic Stick&quot;, featuring 50 Cent, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, staying there for three weeks. The song did not have a commercial release or a music video but was successful due to high radio airplay, peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Airplay chart. A third US-only single, &quot;Thug Luv&quot;, featuring Twista, was released in the last quarter of 2003 and peaked at number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album was certified platinum in the US, selling over 1.1 million copies.

Lil&#x27; Kim promoted the album with a string of concerts, which also featured DMX and Nas. Lil&#x27; Kim was nominated for five Source Awards and won two (&quot;Female Hip-Hop Artist of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Female Single of the Year&quot;). The album also got two Grammy Award nominations for Best Female Rap Solo Performance (&quot;Came Back For You&quot;) and Best Rap Collaboration (&quot;Magic Stick&quot;). She was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with singer Christina Aguilera for the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us Down&quot;, from Aguilera&#x27;s album &quot;Stripped.&quot;

Greg Thomas, an English professor at Syracuse University, began teaching &quot;Hip-Hop Eshu: Queen B@#$H Lyricism 101“. Lil&#x27; Kim herself was a guest speaker. Professor Thomas considered Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s lyrics &quot;the art with the most profound sexual politics I&#x27;ve ever seen anywhere“. David Horowitz criticized the course as &quot;academic degeneracy and decline“. Lil&#x27; Kim also made an appearance on the multi-platform videogame &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY.&quot; Lil&#x27; Kim provided voice-overs for her part in the storyline, where the player may fight an opponent to have Lil&#x27; Kim as their girlfriend.

In 2004, Lil&#x27; Kim recorded a cover of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; which was used as the opening theme for Victoria Gotti&#x27;s reality series &quot;Growing Up Gotti.&quot; That same year, Lil&#x27; Kim was featured on the remix of &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; by Beyoncé. In December 2004, Lil&#x27; Kim began recording a pilot for a VH1 reality show titled &quot;718 Makeover.&quot; The 718 in the title is the area code for Brooklyn, where she grew up. The show did not make it to air.

=== 2005–2008: Prison, &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; and &quot;Ms. G.O.A.T&quot; ===

Lil&#x27; Kim released her fourth album, &quot;The Naked Truth,&quot; on September 27, 2005, while serving a federal prison sentence. It earned her a 5 mic rating from &quot;The Source,&quot; making her the only female rapper to ever receive a 5 mic rating. The album debuted at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 109,000 copies in its first week of release, giving Lil&#x27; Kim her third top 10 debut on the chart. &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; did not sell as well as her previous works, it only managed to reach a gold certification by RIAA. She said that her prison sentence left her with no time to promote the project.

The music video for &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; first single, &quot;Lighters Up&quot;, was number one on BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; for two weeks. &quot;Lighters Up&quot; was a Top Ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. The single also reached number 67 on the German Single Chart, number 12 on the UK Top 75 and number 4 on the Finland Single Chart. The second single, &quot;Whoa&quot; was released on February 17, 2006. It reached number 22 on Airplay.

On March 9, 2006, BET premiered the show &quot;Lil&#x27; Kim: Countdown to Lockdown,&quot; which was filmed before Lil&#x27; Kim headed to prison. The show became the highest rated premiere in BET history, averaging 1.9 million viewers. In May 2006, Debbie Harry released a song in tribute to Lil&#x27; Kim called &quot;Dirty and Deep&quot; in protest of her conviction. The song was available for free from her official website. &quot;Dance Remixes,&quot; her first compilation album, was released on June 6, 2006. The album featured remixes of songs from &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; and &quot;Hard Core.&quot; A limited pressing released only in the US, it received no promotion due to Lil&#x27; Kim being in prison at the time of release and failed to chart. On August 31, 2006, Lil&#x27; Kim presented the award for Best Male Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards; it marked her first televised appearance since being released from prison. She also made appearances on the show &quot;The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll&quot; and &quot;Pussycat Dolls Present: Girlicious&quot; in 2007 and 2008 as a judge.

In January 2008, Lil&#x27; Kim announced that she had parted ways with Atlantic Records, choosing to release future projects independently. She stated she had no hard feelings toward Atlantic, but felt comfortable enough with her knowledge of the music business to do it alone. Lil&#x27; Kim released her first mixtape &quot;Ms. G.O.A.T.,&quot; an acronym for &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot;, on June 3, 2008. It was produced by New York City DJs Mister Cee and DJ Whoo Kid. Among critics, the mixtape received generally positive reviews. It has been called a representation of Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s return to the streets. Tito Salinas of &quot;All Hip Hop&quot; says &quot;Lil&#x27; Kim shows that her time behind bars did not rust all of her swag away&quot; on &quot;Ms. G.O.A.T.&quot; On the other hand, Ehren Gresehover of &quot;New York Mag&quot; says that although one of the tracks &quot;The Miseducation of Lil&#x27; Kim&quot; is not bad, he wished it was Lauryn Hill making a comeback instead.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Black Friday&quot; ===
On March 10, 2009, the song &quot;Girls&quot; by Korean singer Seven featuring Lil&#x27; Kim was released through digital stores as his U.S. debut single. Lil&#x27; Kim appeared in the music video that was released on the same day. &quot;Girls&quot; was produced by Darkchild. On March 24, 2009, she released the song &quot;Download&quot; featuring R&amp;B singers T-Pain and Charlie Wilson. It was written by Lil&#x27; Kim and T-Pain and produced by Trackmasters. The song samples &quot;Computer Love&quot; by Zapp. Although it missed the Hot 100, it did chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 21.

Lil&#x27; Kim appeared on the eighth season of reality series &quot;Dancing with the Stars,&quot; which began airing on March 9, 2009. She was paired with professional dancer Derek Hough. They were eliminated on May 5, 2009, against Ty Murray and his partner Chelsie Hightower, putting Lil&#x27; Kim at fifth place among all thirteen contestants that season. Her elimination was met by many boos from the audience, as she was a consistent high-scorer and fan favorite.

On February 16, 2010, the Ludacris song &quot;Hey Ho&quot;, which featured Lil&#x27; Kim and Lil Fate, was released as a promo single for his seventh studio album &quot;Battle of the Sexes.&quot; In June 2010, Lil&#x27; Kim started her 2010 Tour, her first headlining tour since 2000. It took her across the US, as well as Canada and Europe.

Lil&#x27; Kim released her second mixtape, &quot;Black Friday,&quot; on February 14, 2011. The video for the title track was released on February 16, 2011. The mixtape received mostly negative reviews from critics. It was made available for purchase via PayPal. In May 2011, Lil&#x27; Kim performed in South Africa as part of the music festival ZarFest alongside Fat Joe, Timbaland, and Ciara.

On June 19, 2011, Lil&#x27; Kim performed alongside G-Unit member Shawty Lo and hinted a possible working relationship with G-Unit Records. That same month the song Lil&#x27; Kim, along with Rick Ross, was featured on titled &quot;Anything (To Find You)&quot;, by R&amp;B singer Monica was leaked. The song, which samples the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot;, initially featured just Lil&#x27; Kim, but her second verse was removed to make room for Ross. Her vocals were then removed fully due to contractual issues with B.I.G.&#x27;s estate.

In August 2011, Lil&#x27; Kim performed four dates in Australia as part of the WinterBeatz Festival alongside Fabolous, Mario, 50 Cent and G-Unit. During the August, 17 date in Perth, she joined 50 Cent on stage for a performance of &quot;Magic Stick“. It marked the first time the pair had performed the song together. On November 28, 2011, Lil&#x27; Kim released a buzz single called &quot;I Am Not the One“. She also announced that she would release an EP, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons.

=== 2012–2016: &quot;Hard Core&quot; mixtape and &quot;Lil Kim Season&quot; ===
In the summer of 2011, Lil&#x27; Kim began recording material for her fifth studio album. She had previously been under a restriction banning her from releasing new material as a result of her settlement with Trackmasters, but it had now been lifted. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2012, Lil&#x27; Kim released the song &quot;If You Love Me&quot; produced by Prince Saheb of Knockout Entertainment as a gift to her fans. That same month, it was announced she would make her return to the stage on BET&#x27;s &quot;Rip the Runway.&quot; It marked her first televised performance in years.

In March 2012, during an interview with MTV&#x27;s &quot;Sucker Free,&quot; Lil&#x27; Kim revealed that contract issues with production duo Trackmasters were the reason behind her album delay, saying „...contractually, by the courts, I could not record any music – I wasn&#x27;t supposed to put any music out“. On March 23, 2012, the song &quot;Keys to the City&quot;, a collaboration with Young Jeezy, was leaked to the Internet. Lil&#x27; Kim first mentioned the song during an interview with MTV&#x27;s RapFix, saying &quot;I have a song with another celebrity person that I know the world and my fans are gonna love... It&#x27;s vintage Kim mixed with the new Kim“. During the same RapFix interview, Lil&#x27; Kim also revealed another song, titled &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, which she hopes to do with rapper 50 Cent. Lil&#x27; Kim also commented on the direction of her music, saying she was in &quot;Kanye West mode“, adding „...You do whatever you want to do ...it&#x27;s all about taking chances“. Lil&#x27; Kim kicked off her Return of the Queen Tour on May 17, 2012, to positive reviews.

In a radio interview at Miami&#x27;s 99 Jamz, Lil&#x27; Kim stated that her book, &quot;The Price of Loyalty,&quot; was on hold to coincide with the release of her new album. During an interview with &quot;XXL&quot; on April 26, 2013, she revealed that she does not have a name for the album yet, but the first official single would be out by mid year. Lil&#x27; Kim described the single, produced by Bangladesh, as &quot;different&quot; and &quot;sweet dessert“. On July 11, 2013, Lil&#x27; Kim released the Rockwilder-produced single &quot;Looks Like Money&quot; as a free download for her fans on her birthday.

On July 26, 2013, Lil&#x27; Kim announced and released the cover art for a new mixtape, &quot;Hard Core 2K13,&quot; which would also serve as a sequel to her critically acclaimed debut album, &quot;Hard Core.&quot; The mixtape was originally set to be released on October 31, 2013, but for then unknown reasons, was pushed back. To make up for not releasing the mixtape, Lil&#x27; Kim released the singles &quot;Dead Gal Walking&quot; and &quot;Kimmy Blanco&quot; to the public, along with the track list. The track list revealed collaborations with French Montana, Miley Cyrus, Jadakiss, and Yo Gotti.

On August 2, 2014, Lil&#x27; Kim announced via her Twitter page that she would launch a concert tour to promote her forthcoming &quot;Hard Core&quot; Mixtape. Throughout the remainder of August, Lil&#x27; Kim released a number of remixes to popular songs, including Beyoncé&#x27;s and Nicki Minaj&#x27;s collaboration on &quot;Flawless“, seemingly as a diss to Minaj, reigniting the feud between the two rappers.

On September 11, 2014, the &quot;Hard Core&quot; mixtape was released as free download on Kim&#x27;s official website. In an interview with Revolt TV on the same day, she revealed that she, Iggy Azalea, and T.I. would collaborate on a song sometime in the future, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to be for my album or if we&#x27;re just going to…we have other plans for it as well. But, I think we&#x27;re going to do a double release“. In the same interview, she explained why the mixtape was pushed back twice, stating &quot;When this project was supposed to come out I had got pregnant. I didn&#x27;t know. [...] Once I became fully pregnant, I was working in the studio but at one point I couldn&#x27;t work anymore, obviously“.

In 2016, her fourth mixtape &quot;Lil Kim Season&quot; was released. On the mixtape, she freestyles over several popular beats, Drake&#x27;s &quot;Summer Sixteen“, Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Work“, and Desiigner&#x27;s &quot;Panda“. It received mixed reviews from critics. Jen Yamato from &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote, &quot;if anything, &quot;Lil Kim Season&quot; indicates that Kim&#x27;s got her sights set on returning in a big way—and that she&#x27;s collecting collaborators who might help her achieve it“.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Girls Cruise&quot; and &quot;9&quot; ===
In February 2017, Lil&#x27; Kim announced via her Instagram and an interview that she was working on a new album. Singer Faith Evans featured her on the song &quot;Lovin You for Life&quot; on the album &quot;The King &amp; I,&quot; released on May 19, 2017. That same month, Lil&#x27; Kim along with Eve and Trina was featured on the remix of &quot;I&#x27;m Better&quot; by Missy Elliott. In November, Lil&#x27; Kim released a promotional single &quot;Took Us a Break“, and was featured on the song &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; by rapper Remy Ma. In March 2018, Lil&#x27; Kim released another promotional single, &quot;Spicy“, featuring rapper Fabolous.

On July 11, 2018, Lil&#x27; Kim released the single &quot;Nasty One&quot; from her highly anticipated album, but ultimately the track was not included on the album. That same day during an interview with &quot;Billboard,&quot; she said the album would be released in November of that year. A remix for the single was released on October 26, 2018, and featured Kranium, HoodCelebrityy, and Stefflon Don.

In September 2018, she announced that the debut single for her album &quot;Go Awff&quot; would be released at a later date. The song was eventually released on February 15, 2019. That same month, Kim was spotted in Barbados with fellow hip hop stars Mýa and Chilli, friends Char DeFrancesco (husband to Marc Jacobs and one of Kim&#x27;s best friends) and Tiffany, as well as MTV personalities Pretty Vee and B. Simone from MTV&#x27;s &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out.&quot;

It was later revealed that this was part of a VH1 reality show, &quot;Girls Cruise,&quot; for which Kim would serve as an executive producer. The show followed the group as they set sail to embark on a 10-day cruise in the Caribbean, visiting the countries of Barbados and Trinidad just in time for Carnival festivities. It also documented the group&#x27;s bonding and new friendships with one another. The show premiered on July 15 with approximately 1.2 million viewers and ran for 11 episodes. It is unclear if there will be another season of the series.

In March 2019, Kim revealed that her new album would be titled &quot;9&quot; and added &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of meaning behind that“. Later that month, she announced that the album would be released on May 17, 2019. After a minor setback with her record label, eOne Music, that caused the album not be released on the original planned date, the project was postponed. On September 27, 2019, Kim released a second single, &quot;Found You“, featuring City Girls and O.T. Genasis. The album later became available for pre-order on all digital-download platforms on October 4, 2019 (along with the track &quot;Pray For Me&quot; featuring Rick Ross and Musiq Soulchild), with a release date of October 11, 2019.

Upon its first week of release, the album charted on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop and Rap Album Sales, Digital Albums, Top Albums Sales, Independent Albums and Rap Album Sales. However, the album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 due to selling less than 1,000 copies, and no song from the album landed on the Hot 100 or Bubbling Under. During one of the reunion episodes for &quot;Girls Cruise,&quot; Kim revealed that the album would be a two-part project, stating &quot;I recorded so many songs. I have a part one and a part two“. She also shared that her co-star, the Instagram comedian Vena &quot;Pretty Vee&quot; Excell, would appear on the record.

In October 2019, Kim revealed that she would collaborate with Missy Elliott and Paris Hilton on the follow-up to &quot;9.&quot; In an interview with New York Radio 103.9, Kim confirmed that the City Girls would be involved with the follow-up to &quot;9.&quot; She also stated that she would &quot;love&quot; to have Pretty Vee host her tour. On her November 8, 2019 appearance on &quot;The Real,&quot; Kim again confirmed that Paris Hilton and Missy Elliott would appear on &quot;9&quot;″s follow-up; she said the song &quot;sounds like a classic Missy Elliott record but &#x27;now.&#x27;&quot;(1:20)

== Influences ==
Lil&#x27; Kim cited as her rap influences MC Lyte, Salt-N-Pepa and Roxanne Shanté. She was also influenced by Slick Rick, the Notorious B.I.G., Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Queen Latifah and Mary J. Blige. Lil&#x27; Kim also cited Madonna as an influence, saying she modeled her own career on Madonna&#x27;s, and labeling herself as the &quot;Black Madonna“.

== Products and endorsements ==
In 1998, Lil&#x27; Kim signed with Wilhelmina Models. That same year, she was announced as the face for the fashion brand Candie&#x27;s alongside Brandy.

In 2000, Lil&#x27; Kim signed a deal with fashion house Iceberg, and also with cosmetics brand MAC to help endorse their VIVA GLAM line of lipsticks and lip glosses alongside Mary J. Blige.

The MAC &quot;VIVA GLAM III&quot; campaign, which was built around a plum-brown lipstick, helped raise $4 million for the company in one year and became the most successful VIVA GLAM campaign to date. Due to the success, the two signed on for a second year. The rapper also modeled for the urban fashion line Baby Phat in August 2000. In March 2001, Lil&#x27; Kim, along with several other artists, were in an Apple Mac computer commercial, demonstrating how to burn custom CDs on a Mac.

In November 2012, Lil&#x27; Kim began endorsing Cîroc vodka, revealing her own cocktail, &quot;Queen Bee“, and announcing herself as the &quot;First Lady&quot; of the brand.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2000, Lil&#x27; Kim embarked on a promo tour for her second studio album, &quot;The Notorious K.I.M.,&quot; and the MAC AIDS Fund. She visited MAC cosmetics counters, interacted with fans, and helped raise money and awareness for people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. She took part in MAC&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Cares&quot; show in Toronto, Canada, raising close to one million for its AIDS committee. Her endorsement of MAC, with Mary J. Blige, raised $4 million for the fund.

In October 2001, Lil&#x27; Kim was featured on the R&amp;B mix of the song &quot;What&#x27;s Going On“. She, along with several other popular recording artists, released the song as &quot;Artists Against AIDS Worldwide“, with proceeds going to AIDS programs worldwide and also the September 11th Fund of the United Way. That same month, Lil&#x27; Kim performed at Breathe, a benefit concert for breast cancer research and treatment. Proceeds from the concert went to the UCLA Breast Center and the Breast Examination Center of Harlem, an outreach program of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

On March 12, 2002, Lil&#x27; Kim walked her dogs in the 3rd annual &quot;Paws for Style&quot; fashion show. The event is held by &quot;Animal Fair&quot; magazine as a benefit for the Humane Society of New York. Items worn by the animals were later auctioned off online. In 2004 she launched her own foundation called &quot;Lil&#x27; Kim Cares.&quot; The foundation raises funds, resources and awareness for national programs that assist with issues such as homelessness, HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness, transitional living, child neglect, and violence against women.

Speaking of the foundation, Lil&#x27; Kim stated she planned to be primarily involved in causes that had affected her personally. On April 17, 2004, she participated in the 28th annual Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. The event helped raise more than $100,000 for &quot;Racing for Kids“, a non-profit program benefiting Southern California children&#x27;s hospitals in Long Beach and Orange County. On August 24, 2004, Lil&#x27; Kim encouraged others to vote in the United States presidential election through the Rock the Vote campaign.

On March 10, 2005, Lil&#x27; Kim, along with several other artists, appeared in an episode of &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; Each artist was approached by contestants to donate a &quot;personal experience&quot; to be auctioned off for charity through music channel Fuse&#x27;s &quot;Daily Download&quot; program, with proceeds going to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. In September 2005, she teamed with fashion designer Marc Jacobs for a limited edition T-shirt line featuring images of the rapper. &quot;Marc Jacobs Loves Lil&#x27; Kim&quot; was sold exclusively at Marc Jacobs stores, with 100% of the proceeds going to a charity called The Door.

In 2005 Lil&#x27; Kim donated a diamond watch from her &quot;Royalty&quot; line to the World AIDS Day eBay auction, &quot;Bid 2 Beat AIDS“. Proceeds went to LIFEbeat, an organization providing HIV/AIDS information to millions of young people annually. Through her foundation, Lil&#x27; Kim has given back to many, including teaming up with apparel company Mitchell &amp; Ness and boxer Zab Judah to donate toys to underprivileged youth in Philadelphia in 2005, and joining MusiCares in 2007 for a silent auction, held at the &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; ceremony, to help raise funds for the foundation.

In 2007 Lil&#x27; Kim was a part of the &quot;4th Annual Grammy Charity Holiday Auction,&quot; featuring a large variety of celebrity-signed memorabilia that people could bid on through eBay. On December 1, 2007, Lil&#x27; Kim partnered with Preserve Our Legacy and the New Jersey Stem Cell Research and Education Foundation to host a celebrity basketball game to raise awareness about various health issues plaguing minority communities.

On July 11, 2010, Lil&#x27; Kim launched her signature milkshake, the &quot;Queen Bee“, at Millions of Milkshakes in West Hollywood, with proceeds going towards Wyclef Jean&#x27;s Yéle Haiti Foundation. On February 9, 2013, she took part in the first annual &quot;Reality On The Runway&quot; fashion show. The event helped raise $300,000 for people infected with HIV/AIDS and increase awareness.

Lil&#x27; Kim has been a longtime LGBT advocate, and has participated in many gay pride festivals, including the LGBT Pride March in New York City, as well as performing at Atlanta Black Pride and D.C. Black Pride.

== Personal life ==
In her teens, Jones dated Shawn Powell. The pair met at the Empire Roller Skating rink in Brooklyn. After a couple of months of seeing each other, Powell was arrested for robbery and sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. Jones and Powell continued their relationship, with Jones visiting frequently. They kept in touch by writing letters. The couple became engaged while Powell was incarcerated.

During this time, Jones met Christopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.). She focused on starting her rap career and called off the engagement with Powell. In 1996, during the recording of her debut album, Jones became pregnant with Wallace&#x27;s child. She did not make it public until 1999 during an interview with &quot;The Source.&quot; Jones decided to terminate the pregnancy. &quot;I already knew the kind of relationship that Biggie and I had, and I knew that [having a child] was something that couldn&#x27;t take place..“.

Wallace called Jones three days before his death and told her he loved her. In a 2010 interview with Ed Lover on Power 105, Jones revealed that Wallace assaulted her and she described an incident where he choked her to unconsciousness. In 2017, Jones admitted her relationship with Wallace was &quot;very violent&quot; after Jermaine Dupri claimed that he witnessed Wallace pull a pistol out on Jones.

On July 23, 1996, Jones was arrested for possession of marijuana after police raided Wallace&#x27;s Teaneck, New Jersey home. Police smelled marijuana inside the home when they went to ask for someone to move an illegally parked car. Jones denied she was smoking, claiming she was &quot;upstairs all day sleeping“. On March 17, 1999, Teaneck police issued an arrest warrant after Jones failed to turn up for court dates stemming from the arrest.

The warrant was not a top priority for the police, and was not made public until September 2003, after a story was published online by The Smoking Gun. Jones was later removed from Teaneck&#x27;s wanted list in October 2003, after $350 in bail was posted on her behalf. Jones&#x27; attorney told reporters that she did not appear in court because she believed the case had been resolved.

In 2002, Jones started dating Damion &quot;World&quot; Hardy. The couple split in 2003, and she stated she was a victim of physical abuse leading to multiple nose jobs as a result of being punched.

On June 20, 2003, Jones had $250,000 worth of jewelry stolen while catching a flight at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport after a bag, which she intended to carry on, was mixed up with eight other pieces of her luggage. The missing jewelry was recovered 10 days later, found wrapped up in a rag in a locker room for airline employees by a United Airlines worker.

In 2004, Jones dated record producer Scott Storch, whom she met when he offered her a ride to her hotel. The couple split after two months. In 2013, Storch revealed that he would have married Jones if the relationship had worked out. In 2007, Jones and Ray J briefly dated.

On March 17, 2005, Lil&#x27; Kim was convicted of three counts of conspiracy and one count of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury about her and her friends&#x27; involvement in a 2001 shooting outside the Hot 97 studios in Manhattan. During the trial of her co-manager, Damion &quot;D-Roc&quot; Butler, and her bodyguard, Suif &quot;Gutta&quot; Jackson, a former member of the hip hop group Junior M.A.F.I.A., she testified before a grand jury that she did not know they were at the scene. However, video footage from a security camera placed all three at the scene, exiting the building.

Butler and Jackson pleaded guilty to gun charges. Jackson was sentenced to twelve years in federal prison as part of plea bargain in which he admitted to firing at least twenty rounds during the incident. The length of the sentence was said to have been influenced by his previous gun-related convictions.

In July 2005, Lil&#x27; Kim was sentenced to one year in prison, thirty days&#x27; home detention upon release from custody, and three years of probation. She served the entirety of her sentence at the Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia in Center City, Philadelphia. She was released on July 3, 2006, after serving approximately 12 months. Her Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) supervision ended on August 2, 2006.

On June 9, 2014, Jones gave birth to a daughter named Royal Reign. Royal has started modeling, walking the catwalk in the New York Fashion Week Show in 2023 as part of the 13th Annual Rookie USA Fashion Show. 

Lil&#x27; Kim was in a relationship with Royal&#x27;s father, Jeremy Neil, who goes by the rap name Mr. Papers from 2012 to 2014, and then again from 2020 through at least part of 2021. He has called her his &quot;wife&quot; before although they have never been legally married. Their initial breakup was somewhat contentious, with Lil&#x27; Kim claiming that he was a domestic abuser and Mr. Papers alternatively dissing her and performing somber freestyle raps lamenting the circumstances and lack of access to Royal. They have not mentioned being a couple on social media since 2021 and Mr. Papers was referred to as Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s ex again in news reports that were released in 2022, but they never formally broke up with each other publicly. 

According to an interview released in April 2024, Lil&#x27; Kim is currently dating Tayy Brown, a rapper who is signed to her record label. 

Jones identifies as a Christian.

== Feuds ==
=== Foxy Brown ===
Once high school friends, Lil&#x27; Kim and fellow Brooklyn rapper Foxy Brown originally remained close despite becoming associates of clashing hip hop groups Junior M.A.F.I.A. and the Firm, respectively. In 1995, they collaborated with Da Brat for the remix of &quot;No One Else&quot; by Total. The following year, they were featured in the Hot 97 NY Fashion Show and appeared on the covers of &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;Vibe.&quot; However, their first dispute developed after both of their debut studio albums were scheduled for release a week apart in November 1996.

In 1996, Media outlets noted similarities between the sleeve covers of Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hard Core&quot; and Brown&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ill Na Na&quot;, where the two were shown wearing the same outfit. In 1997, the feud led to the deterioration of their friendship, and resulted in the cancellation of a collaborative album &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. Brown noted that the breakdown of their relationship was influenced by their conflicting entourages. They first attempted a reconciliation in 1998 after Lil&#x27; Kim called Brown and her mother after the two were held at gunpoint during a house burglary.

In January 1999, critics noted the track &quot;My Life&quot; from Brown&#x27;s second studio effort &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; as being an &quot;open appeal&quot; to their friendship. In the song, Brown describes their relationship being &quot;lost for pride&quot;. Later in the album, however, Brown attacks &quot;mistresses“. As music journalist Evelyn McDonnell noted, this seemed pointed at Lil&#x27; Kim. Critics thought the records were a subtle diss to Lil&#x27; Kim, especially since during this time Brown had supported Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s rival, singer Faith Evans, in multiple interviews. In February 1999, some music critics noted that Brown &quot;suddenly sounded &#x27;exactly&#x27; like Lil&#x27; Kim“.

In late May 1999, Lil&#x27; Cease&#x27;s single &quot;Play Around&quot;, featuring Lil&#x27; Kim and Diddy, was released and featured on his debut &quot;The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo&quot;. In the song, after Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s verse, Diddy raps: &quot;Stop trying to sound like her too bitches&quot;; a diss aimed at Foxy Brown. The line spurred enough controversy that a writer remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s finally coming out. Foxy Brown bites worse than a pit bull“. Additionally, Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s guest appearance on the remix version of Mobb Deep&#x27;s song &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; and her second album&#x27;s title track, &quot;The Notorious K.I.M“., were both released as diss records aimed at Foxy Brown.

Angered by Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s response, Brown collaborated with longtime associates Capone-N-Noreaga on the track, &quot;Bang, Bang“. In the track, Brown mimicked Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s interpretation of MC Lyte&#x27;s famous disstrack &quot;10% Dis&quot;, and went on to recite: &quot;You and Diddy y&#x27;all kill me with that subliminal shit“. Towards the end of her verse, Brown mocked Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s grieving for the loss of rapper the Notorious B.I.G. by remarking: &quot;Let the nigga [Biggie] rest in peace, and hop off his dick, bitch do you“.

On February 26, 2001, at 3 p.m., as Lil&#x27; Kim left New York radio station Hot 97, over twenty shots were fired between two groups of three men. One of the men, Capone of Capone-N-Noreaga, was entering the Hot 97 building promote DJ Clue&#x27;s new album, &quot;The Professional 2&quot; (which happened to have also featured Lil&#x27; Kim). An affiliate, Efrain Ocasio from Capone&#x27;s entourage, was shot in the back; both Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s and Capone&#x27;s groups denied any involvement in the shooting. However, detectives later informed &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; that it was a result of the verses Foxy Brown recited in &quot;Bang, Bang“.

Shaken up by the incident, Brown tried to reach out to Lil&#x27; Kim for a truce. Brown stated, &quot;I really don&#x27;t know how it started. But Russell [Simmons] and I, we got together, and I said, &#x27;Russell, I want to call a truce.&#x27; I want to have a sit-down with Kim. I don&#x27;t care what it is. Let&#x27;s just end it. We can even do a collaboration. We&#x27;re bigger than this. If it has to start with me, let it start with me“. Brown extended an olive branch to Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s camp, however Lil&#x27; Kim had cut all ties with Diddy and Bad Boy associates and wanted no communication with Brown whatsoever. In March 2005, Lil&#x27; Kim was convicted of lying about the shooting to a federal grand jury. On July 6, 2005, she was sentenced to prison for three counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy.

During the four years before Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s sentencing, she and Brown exchanged subtle diss records, among them Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;La Bella Mafia,&quot; &quot;Quiet“, and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back&quot;; and in turn, Brown&#x27;s &quot;Ill Na Na 2: The Fever&quot; and various mixtape freestyles. In the midst of these diss recordings, radio host Doug Banks interviewed Brown in 2003, hoping she would disclose further details pertaining to their dispute. Brown claimed that Lil&#x27; Kim was allegedly jealous that Biggie was to include Brown in his Junior M.A.F.I.A. collective. Brown also added that a tell-all book disclosing the feud would be released for Christmas 2003. In her final comments on the dispute, Brown stated: &quot;Kim is the only female artist that keeps me on my toes. She&#x27;s the only one that I can look at; and any other artist that says they don&#x27;t have that one person that keeps them driven... is lying“.

Following her release from prison, Lil&#x27; Kim no longer acknowledged Brown. Brown, on the other hand, has consistently targeted Lil&#x27; Kim in her music and concert venues since the latter&#x27;s prison release.

On May 17, 2012, Lil&#x27; Kim gave an interview to a radio show, &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; When asked about whether or not she had spoken to Brown at all in recent years, she replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know her. And when I say that; I don&#x27;t know who she is to these days. I wouldn&#x27;t even know what her voice sounds like“.

=== Nicki Minaj ===
Lil&#x27; Kim has been embroiled in a feud with rapper Nicki Minaj since Minaj&#x27;s success with &quot;Pink Friday.&quot; With Lil&#x27; Kim and media critics noticing resemblances with her on the &quot;Sucka Free&quot; mixtape, Lil&#x27; Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, &quot;If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That&#x27;s how it goes to me“. Minaj&#x27;s single &quot;Roman&#x27;s Revenge&quot; with Eminem was believed by critics to be a response to Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s comments, although at the time she denied this.

Minaj responded to the situation in an interview on The Angie Martinez show, saying &quot;She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it&#x27;s &#x27;cause you gettin&#x27; at somebody! Where&#x27;s your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on &quot;Billboard,&quot; that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It&#x27;s Barbie, bitch“.

Lil&#x27; Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape &quot;Black Friday,&quot; an album that directly referenced Nicki Minaj, via her debut album title and freestyling on Minaj&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Did It On&#x27;em&quot; (that became &quot;Pissin&#x27; On&#x27;em&quot;). The mixtape cover featured artwork that showed Lil&#x27; Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of Minaj&#x27;s diss track &quot;Tragedy&quot; was released online in April 2011, featuring lyrics &quot;Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal“. Following the release of Minaj&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,&quot; critics suggested that the tracks &quot;Stupid Hoe&quot; may have contained attacks at Lil&#x27; Kim. Lil&#x27; Kim later suggested in an interview with Power105&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; that the song &quot;Automatic&quot; from Minaj&#x27;s second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj &quot;obnoxious&quot; and &quot;catty“.

In a 2018 interview with Genius, Minaj alluded to the situation with Lil&#x27; Kim, seemingly confirming that the track &quot;Roman&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was about the feud, saying, &quot;Someone got at me. A veteran got at me, and I hit them with &#x27;Roman&#x27;s Revenge&#x27; and then I kept on going“. In 2021, Lil&#x27; Kim stated on the red carpet of the BET Awards that she would like to do a Verzuz with Minaj.

== Legacy ==
 Several media outlets have referred to Lil&#x27; Kim as the &quot;Queen of Rap“, and by the alias she uses, &quot;Queen Bee“. &quot;Newsweek&quot; has called her the &quot;First Lady of Rap“, with editor Allison Samuels writing in 2000 that she has &quot;transcended the male-dominated world of rap to become one of America&#x27;s sassiest, most engaging icons“.

Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s music catalog features undertones of sex-positive feminism and the importance of female pleasure, instead of the man as the &quot;dominant priority“, through explicit lyrics about sex. &quot;Dazed&quot; considered her &quot;the first high-profile female rapper to flip the script on female objectification in the rap industry“. For &quot;NME&quot;″s editor Jordan Bassett, she &quot;out-filthed the male rappers at every turn“.

According to BBC News, &quot;Hard Core&quot; (1996) was the most successful debut album by a female hip hop artist at the time; the album saw her &quot;inhabit the territory of sexual edginess and hardcore rap, traditionally the preserve inhabited by male artists“. In 2000, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Isaac Guzman wrote that her debut solo album created a path for a new wave of female rappers, with her at the forefront of her generation, and established her as &quot;the raunchiest, hardest, sexiest, most glamorous woman in all of hip-hop“.

During that time, several new female hip hop artists modeled themselves after her stylistically. Placing &quot;Hard Core&quot; at number 80 on their list of &quot;Best Rap Albums of the 90s“, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine stated, &quot;when Lil Kim released her debut album—women in hip-hop finally had options, paths to follow and models [...] she was the raunchiest woman you ever heard on the mic“. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; writer Joan Morgan contended that the album &quot;transformed her into a cultural icon“, opining that it put an emphasis on sex appeal, looks, and packaging as a priority for female rappers. &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; listed her as one of the late twentieth-century &quot;self-marketers of female trouble&quot; in music, along with Janet Jackson and Tina Turner. In 2020, &quot;XXL&quot; wrote that &quot;twenty-five years later, no rapper is more influential to the new female rhymers“.

Aside from music, Lil&#x27; Kim is also known for a risk-taking and luxurious approach to fashion that has inspired many artists. She has been named as a fashion icon by various media outlets. &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-at-large André Leon Talley called her &quot;the black Madonna“. Designers such as Marc Jacobs, Versace, and Giorgio Armani have credited Lil&#x27; Kim as an inspiration. Her collaboration with nail artist Bernadette Thompson in wearing her &quot;money nails&quot; is described by &quot;Harper&#x27;s BAZAAR&quot; to have been &quot;a defining moment in the history of hip-hop and beauty&quot; and lead to mainstream fashion&#x27;s acceptance of intricate nail art. A replica of the money nails she wore has been exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art alongside other notable fashion items such as the Wonderbra and red lipstick. 

Some artists who have named Kim as influence include Rihanna, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Kash Doll, Bree Runway, Teyana Taylor, Doja Cat, Rosalía, Hitmaka, Casanova, Spice, Zaytoven, Stefflon Don, Flo Milli, Nicki Minaj, Ivorian Doll, Cupcakke, Saweetie, Ice Spice, Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Ms Banks, Lola Brooke, Jhené Aiko, City Girls, DreamDoll, Latto, and Erica Banks. Actress Taraji P. Henson said that Lil&#x27; Kim inspired her portrayal of &quot;Empire&quot; character Cookie Lyon.

Throughout her career, Lil&#x27; Kim has earned numerous honors and awards. Her debut &quot;Hard Core&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA, and is considered a classic hip-hop album.

Her song &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; with Christina Aguilera, Mýa, and Pink, is one of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide, with sales of over 5.1 million worldwide. &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; went number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her one of only a few female rappers to have a number one on that chart. The song won a 2002 Grammy Award in the category of &quot;Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals“.

<doc id="215674" wikidata="Q6541424" url="?curid=215674" title="Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property">
<text>Libertarians have differing opinions on the validity of intellectual property. Most left-libertarians oppose it whereas among right-libertarians and Libertarian parties there is more nuance, ranging from strong opposition to neutrality and support (particularly from those who are influenced by Ayn Rand&#x27;s views).

== Left-libertarianism ==
Most left-libertarians, dating back to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (a libertarian socialist who is considered &quot;the father of anarchism&quot;), oppose intellectual property as part of their broad criticism of capitalism and anti-capitalism. Benjamin Tucker, a 19th-century American individualist anarchist opposing intellectual property, argued that &quot;the patent monopoly consists in protecting inventors against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all.&quot; Lysander Spooner, another 19th-century American individualist anarchist or left-libertarian who also influenced right-libertarians, argued for some forms of intellectual property, while Henry George distinguished between patents and copyrights.

Into the 21st century, Roderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and that since information exists in people&#x27;s minds and other people&#x27;s property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Arguing that authors and publishers would continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.

== Right-libertarianism ==
Anarcho-capitalists oppose the existence of even a minimal state. This ideological framework requires that any functions served by intellectual property law promulgation and enforcement be provided through private sector institutions. Murray Rothbard argued for allowing contractually arising infinite copyright terms and against the need for any government role in protecting intellectual property. Rothbard states that government&#x27;s involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration and scope of intellectual property in order to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot; is inherently problematic, saying: &quot;By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are &#x27;too much,&#x27; &#x27;too little,&#x27; or just about enough?&quot; Thus, he argued that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages improvement of their invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on their domain.

Morris and Linda Tannehill proposed that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned &quot;data bank&quot;. The inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use. Opponents to intellectual property rights include Wendy McElroy, Tom G. Palmer, Henri Lepage, Boudewijn Bouckaert, Jeffrey Tucker, and Stephan Kinsella. Kinsella observes in &quot;Against Intellectual Property&quot; that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He writes that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also states that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others&#x27; physical property rights. David D. Friedman takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, arguing that &quot;there are good arguments on both sides of that question&quot;. J. Neil Schulman instead argued in favor of intellectual property.

== Ayn Rand ==
Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism who herself was not a libertarian but who had a significant influence on Rothbard (prior to his department from her philosophical studies circle) and other right-libertarians, supported copyrights and patents. In &quot;&quot;, she wrote:
Rand held that patent should be granted for limited terms only. She wrote:
== Libertarian political parties ==
The Libertarian Party of Canada takes &quot;a moderate approach to patents and copyrights&quot;, calling for &quot;a careful review of existing and proposed legislation&quot;. The Libertarian Party of Russia writes in its platform that &quot;intellectual property&quot; is a privilege granted by the state. Accordingly, &quot;intellectual property rights&quot; are enforced by the state through violence. On this basis, it writes in its program that it intends to repeal the section of the Civil Code of Russia, as well as the articles of the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses and Criminal Code of Russia that provide for sanctions for infringement of &quot;intellectual property rights&quot;.

<text>Sukhothai Historical Park ( (Pronunciation)) covers the ruins of Sukhothai, literally &#x27;dawn of happiness&#x27;, capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries, in north central Thailand. It is near the city of Sukhothai, capital of Sukhothai Province.

The city&#x27;s walls form a rectangle about east-west by north-south. There are 193 ruins on of land. There is a gate in the centre of each wall. Inside are the remains of the royal palace and twenty-six temples, the largest being Wat Mahathat. The park is maintained by the Fine Arts Department of Thailand with help from UNESCO, which has declared it a World Heritage Site. Each year, the park welcomes thousands of visitors.

== History ==

=== Khmer Era ===
Originally, Sukhothai was a Khmer empire&#x27;s outpost named Sukhodaya. During the reign of Khmer Empire, the Khmers built some monuments there, several of them survived in Sukhothai Historical Park such as the Ta Pha Daeng shrine, Wat Phra Phai Luang, and Wat Sisawai. About some 50 kilometer north of Sukhothai is another Khmer military outpost of Si Satchanalai or Sri Sajanalaya.

In the mid-13th century, the Tai tribes led by Si Indradit rebelled against the Khmer governor at Sukhodaya and established Sukhothai as an independent Tai state and remained the center of Tai power until the end of the fourteenth century.

===Liberation from Khmer Empire (Lavo)===
Prior to the 13th century, a succession of Tai kingdoms existed in the northern highlands including the Ngoenyang (centered on Chiang Saen, predecessor of Lan Na) kingdom and the Heokam (centered on Chiang Hung, modern Jinghong in China) kingdom of Tai Lue people. Sukhothai had been a trade center and part of Lawo, which was under the domination of the Khmer Empire. The migration of Tai people into the upper Chao Phraya valley was somewhat gradual.

Modern historians believe that the secession of Sukhothai (once known as &quot;Sukhodaya&quot;) from the Khmer empire began as early as 1180 during the reign of Pho Khun Sri Naw Namthom who was the ruler of Sukhothai and the peripheral city of Sri Satchanalai (modern day Si Satchanalai District in Sukhothai Province). Sukhothai had enjoyed substantial autonomy until it was re-conquered around 1180 by the Mons of Lawo under Khomsabad Khlonlampong.

Two brothers, Pho Khun Bangklanghao and Pho Khun Phameung took Sukhothai from Mon hands in 1239. Khun (ขุน) before becoming a Thai feudal title, was a Tai title for a ruler of a fortified town and its surrounding villages, together called a muang; in older usage prefixed &quot;pho&quot; () &#x27;father&#x27;, Comparable in sound and meaning to . Bangklanghao ruled Sukhothai as Sri Indraditya and began the Phra Ruang dynasty. He expanded his kingdom to bordering cities. At the end of his reign in 1257, the Sukhothai Kingdom covered the entire upper valley of the Chao Phraya River (then known simply as &quot;Menam&quot;, &#x27;mother of waters&#x27;, the generic Thai name for rivers.)

Traditional Thai historians considered the founding of the Sukhothai Kingdom as the beginning of the Thai nation because little was known about the kingdoms prior to Sukhothai. Modern historical studies demonstrate that Thai history began before Sukhothai. Yet the foundation of Sukhothai is still a celebrated event.

===Expansions under Ramkamhaeng===

Pho Khun Ban Muang and his brother Ram Khamhaeng expanded the Sukhothai Kingdom. To the south, Ramkamhaeng subjugated the kingdoms of Supannabhum and Sri Thamnakorn (Tambralinga) and, through Tambralinga, adopted Theravada as the state religion. To the north, Ramkamhaeng put Phrae and Muang Sua (Luang Prabang) under tribute.

To the west, Ramkhamhaeng helped the Mons under Wareru (who is said to have eloped with Ramkamhaeng&#x27;s daughter) to free themselves from Pagan domination and establish a kingdom at Martaban (they later moved to Pegu). So, Thai historians considered the Kingdom of Martaban a Sukhothai tributary. In practice, Sukhothai domination may not have extended that far.

With regard to culture, Ramkhamhaeng had the monks from Sri Thamnakorn propagate the Theravada religion in Sukhothai. In 1283, Ramkamhaeng is said to have invented Thai script, incorporating it into the controversial Ramkamhaeng Stele discovered by Mongkut 600 years later.

It was also during this period that the first contacts with Yuan dynasty were established and Sukhothai began sending trade missions to China. One well-known export of Sukhothai was the &quot;Sangkalok&quot; (Song dynasty pottery). This was the only period that Siam produced Chinese-styled ceramics, which fell out of use by the 14th century.

===Decline and domination of Ayutthaya===
Sukhothai domination was short-lived. After the death of Ramkhamhaeng in 1298, Sukhothai&#x27;s tributaries broke away. Ramkhamhaeng was succeeded by his son, Loe Thai. The vassal kingdoms, first Uttaradit in the north, then soon after the Laotian kingdoms of Luang Prabang and Vientiane (Wiangchan), liberated themselves. In 1319 the Mon state to the west broke away, and in 1321 the Lanna absorbed Tak, one of the oldest towns under the control of Sukhothai. To the south, the powerful city of Suphanburi also broke free early in the reign of Loe Thai. Thus the kingdom was quickly reduced to its former local importance only. Finally in 1378, the armies of the expanding Ayutthaya Kingdom invaded and forced Sukhothai&#x27;s King Thammaracha II to yield to this new power. After the Battle of Sittaung River in 1583, King Naresuan of Phitsanulok (and crown prince of Ayutthaya) forcibly relocated people from Sukhothai and surrounding areas to the Southern Central plain, due to the war with the Burmese and an earthquake.

===Later Development===
Sukhothai repopulated again but declined due to successive Burmese–Siamese wars, especially the Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67). In 1793 Rama I, after establishing Bangkok as a new capital city of the kingdom, founded New Sukhothai in Thani, 12 km (7.5 mi) to the east of old Sukhothai, thus abandoning Sukhothai. In 1801 Rama I commissioned the construction of many royal temples in the capital city. He ordered that old Buddha images be brought to Bangkok from the ruined temples around the country. One of the Buddha images is the famous eight metre (25 foot) tall bronze Phra Sri Sakyamuni (; ), the principal Buddha image of Wat Suthat, which was the principal Buddha image of Wat Mahathat, the biggest temple in Sukhothai. In 1833 Mongkut, during his monkhood, travelled to Sukhothai and discovered the controversial Ramkhamhaeng stele in Wat Mahathat and other artifacts, now in the National Museum in Bangkok. The formal name of this stone is The King Ram Khamhaeng Inscription Documentary heritage inscribed on the Memory of the World Register in 2003 by UNESCO.
In 1907, Vajiravudh, as crown prince, conducted a two-month archaeological field trip to Nakhon Sawan, Kampheang Phet, Sukhothai, Si Satchanalai, Uttaradit, and Pitsanulok. He later published &quot;Phra Ruang City Journey&quot; (; ) to promote historical and archaeological study by the public. The work has been used by later archaeologists and historians including Damrong Rajanubhab, the founder of the modern Thai educational system and George Coedès, a 20th-century scholar of southeast Asian archaeology and history.
In July 1988 the historical park was officially opened. On 12 December 1991, it was declared a World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Town of Sukhothai and Associated Historic Towns together with the associated historical parks in Kamphaeng Phet and Si Satchanalai.

==Management==
Sukhothai Historical Park is managed by the Fine Arts Department, Ministry of Culture. The protection of the area was first announced in the Royal Gazette on 6 June 1962. The enabling law is the Act on Ancient Monuments, Antiques, Objects of Art and National Museums, B.E. 2504 (1961) as amended by Act (No. 2), B.E. 2535 (1992).

==Sights==

===Wat Mahathat===

Wat Mahathat or Mahathat Temple () is the most important and impressive temple in Sukhothai Historical Park. The temple&#x27;s name translates to &#x27;temple of the great relic&#x27;. The temple was founded by Sri Indraditya, between 1292 and 1347 as the main temple of the city as well as the Sukhothai Kingdom. The design is based on a &quot;mandala&quot;, representing the universe, with a principal stupa, built in 1345 to enshrine relics of the Buddha, surrounded by smaller stupas in eight directions. The main stupa has the shape of a lotus bud, which characterizes Sukhothai architectural arts. Its base is adorned with 168 stuccoed sculptings of Buddhist disciples walking with their hands clasped together in salutation. The eight smaller stupas, of which the four at the corners are in Mon Haripunchai - Lanna style and the four in between show Khmer influence. At both sides of the main stupa has two standing Buddha images called Phra Attharot (). The temple also includes an assembly hall (vihara), mandapa, ordination hall, and 200 subordinate stupas.

===Noen Prasat===

&quot;Noen Prasat&quot; or Palace Hill () is the remains of the royal palace of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. The Noen Prasat was discovered in 1833 by Mongkut, who had made a pilgrimage to the north of Siam as a monk. The palace was built on a square base with the dimensions of 200 x 200 meters. Nearby were two small ponds where the archaeologists found the remains of terracotta pipes which probably been used to supply water from a city lake to the ponds. In the southwest, there are the remains of a brick platform on which they found ashes and bones inside, so It can be assumed that it was the royal cremation place. The Ramkhamhaeng stele was discovered here by Mongkut. He also discovered the so-called &quot;Manangasila Throne&quot; (), an approximately 1m x 2, 50m x 15 cm large slab of gray stone, which is decorated with lotus petals depiction. The Ramkhamhaeng Stele says that Ramkhamhaeng erected this stone throne in the sugar palm grove. Mongkut took these finds to Bangkok.

===Ramkhamhaeng National Museum===

Ramkhamhaeng National Museum () is a branch of the National Museum of Thailand in the Sukhothai Historical Park. It was opened in 1964 by Thailand&#x27;s King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. More than 2,000 artifacts were donated from Phra Ratchaprasitthikhun, the abbot of Ratchathani Temple. Locals also contributed to the collection by donating many historical objects. Most of the objects on display in the main museum building, come from Sukhothai, others were found in Si Satchanalai, Kamphaeng Phet, Phichit and Phetchabun. The collection including Buddha images and Hindu god sculptures from Wat Phra Phai Luang and Wat Mahathat, sculptures from the pre-Sukhothai period (about 13th century), Sukhothai artifacts from the 14th and 15th centuries, early Ayutthaya artifacts from about 1351 to 1488, porcelain from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, which was found during the excavations in Sukhothai and Si Satchanalai.

===Wat Si Sawai===
Wat Si Sawai or Si Sawai Temple () is one of the oldest temples in Sukhothai. The temple was founded in the late-12th or early-13th century as a Hindu Shrine for Vishnu and the place for the Thiruppavai ceremony before the liberation from Lawo and foundation of Sukhothai Kingdom. The temple has three well-preserved laterite prangs, representing the Hindu trinity, enclosed by a double rampart and a moat. The lower parts of prangs are apparently Khmer, while the upper have been expanded or renovated by Thais in brick and stucco. The central prang is held in Lawo or Hindu-style. Each prang contains a cella, possibly a podium for lingam and crypt. There are few remaining stucco works on the top of central prang. Later around the 14th century the temple was adapted to the needs of the Buddhist faith: vihara were added to the south of the central prang. Numerous Chinese porcelains and Hindu god statues had been found in the area. One of artifacts is the Shiva statue discovered by Vajiravudh in 1907.

===Wat Phra Phai Luang===

Wat Phra Phai Luang () was the ritual center of Sukhothai and the biggest temple in the city area. Built in the late 12th century during the reign of Jayavarman VII when the city was still under control of Khmer-Lavo. After the liberation and the construction of Wat Mahathat, Wat Phra Phai Luang lost it main ceremonial role and become Theravada Buddhist temple. Similar to Wat Si Sawai, the temple has three laterite prang, but only one still preserved in good condition. Archaeologists suspect that the three prangs originally stood on a common laterite base. All three prangs were open to the east, with doors flanked by columns which carry a richly decorated tympanum depicting scenes from the life of Buddha. The doors on the other three sides were so-called &quot;false doors&quot;. The tympanum The complex is enclosed by double moat. The outer moat is 600 meters length and is fed by the Lam-Pan River. In the north-west of prang complex are the remains of late 14th century vihara, mandapa and a small ordination hall with eight Bai Sema. The temple is an important place to study the transition of Khmer art to Thai art. Since in the 14th century the prang has been renovated by adding elaborate stucco in leaves and frames patterns which become the basic pattern of Thai art; however, most of stucco arts are now kept at Ramkhamhaeng National Museum.

===Wat Sa Si===
Wat Sa Si () is a small temple close to Ramkhamhaeng Monument. Wat Sa Si is beautifully situated in the midst of Traphang-Trakuan lake northwest of Wat Mahathat. Due to its location, the temple is one of the most beautiful place in Sukhothai. The temple has a Lanka styled stupa. The vihara of Wat Sa Si is situated on the east side of the stupa. Further east lies the ordination hall on its own little island. Also a large number of smaller stupas, of which today only the foundations are visible. Due to the similarities in structure and similar Bai Sema landmarks, it is believed today that Wat Sa Si were built at the same time of Wat Tra Kuan and Wat Chana Songkhram.

===Wat Asokaram===
Wat Asokārām () or Wat Salat Dai () was founded in the time of Sukhothai Kingdom in the reign of Sailuethai in 1399. The name of Asokaram was forgotten for a long time. Locals called the temple &quot;Wat Salat Dai&quot; because the terrain of Euphorbia antiquorum () was overgrown in the temple area. In 1958 treasure hunters dug the stupa, they found a stone inscription. Today it is on display in the Ramkhamhaeng National Museum. The stone inscription informed that Wat Asokaram was found in 1399 by the widow of Luethai, the Queen Mother, the &quot;Satṃtec brah Rājadebī Sri Cuḷālakṣana Arrgarājamahesī Debadhòranī Tilakaratana&quot;. She was the daughter of Lithai. By her husband, Luethai they had two sons, Sailuethai, and Asoka. It is not clear why she named the temple Asokaram. One possible reason is to be a monument for her son, Asoka, other reason might have been even the name of an ancestor or even the Indian ruler Asoka. Another possibility is the name refers to &quot;Asoka trees&quot; Saraca asoca that are common on the temple grounds. The temple attractions are the large 5-stage step pyramid stupa, a vihara, a mandapa, and foundations of smaller pagodas.

===Wat Tra Kuan===

Wat Tra Kuan () is a small temple close to Ramkhamhaeng Monument north of Wat Mahathat. The original name of the temple is not Thai, according to a theory of Vajiravudh Tra Kuan is a Khmer term for a plant that is morning glory, a medicinal plant is used in traditional Asian medicine. Wat Tra Kuan was founded in the time of the Kingdom of Sukhothai, probably the temple was finished at the beginning of the 15th century. A majestic stupa in Lanka styled is in the west of the site. Its square base has three tier layers. East of stupa are the ruins of an ordination hall with a small terrace, six columns and a staircase on the eastern side. This layout differs from the standard Sukhothai temple, usually east of stupa should be vihara. Simple Bai Sema and the foundations of several smaller stupas are arranged around the ordination hall. In 1960s Archaeologists found a bronze Buddha image on the premises. This unique Buddha image, is now kept in the Ramkhamhaeng National Museum, resembles Lanna and Lanka styles with Sukhothai influence, thus the art historian called this style &quot;Wat Tra Kuan style&quot;.

===Wat Chana Songkhram===

Wat Chana Songkhram () is a small temple close to Ramkhamhaeng Monument north of Wat Mahathat in the same area with Wat Sa Si and Wat Tra Kuan. The temple was built in the time of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Today only ruins of the former layout can be seen. The largest stupa is an example of the Lanka - Sukhothai style with bell shaped. Buildings are arranged around the number of smaller stupas. Located on the east side of stupa have Ayutthaya period building. An ordination hall is located on the eastern border of the temple.

===Wat Pa Mamuang===

Wat Pa Mamuang or Pa Mamuang Temple () means the mango forest monastery and was a temple of the prestigious forest monks in which the Sangharaja resided. According to legend, Ramkhamhaeng planted a mango grove in front of the city. Here Luethai founded a royal temple, Wat Pa Mamuang was called. He built a Mandapa for the &quot;Devalayamahaksetra&quot;, a Brahmin shrine. Although Sukhothai kings were devoted Buddhists, the royal Brahmin ceremonies was still practiced in the court. The excavations found in the 20th century that Lithai made two larger than life bronze statues of Shiva and Vishnu. The statues are now on display in the National Museum in Bangkok. In 1341 when Sukhothai adopted Ceylon Theravada Buddhism or Lankavamsa (นิกายลังกาวงศ์), Luethai invited a monk from Ceylon, Sumana Thera, to Sukhothai and resided in this temple. In 1361 Lithai appointed the famous monk Mahasamī to be Sangharaja, Mahasami had also acquired his profound knowledge of the Tipitaka during long studies in Ceylon. He renovated and enlarged the temple. On November 23, 1361 Lithai had ordained to become the monk, thus the first Siamese king who spent time in the Buddhist monastic life. A tradition which continue until present day.

===Wat Chang Lom===

Wat Chang Lom () is a temple complex consist of a large stupa in Lanka style with the remains of a gallery, the ruins of a vihara and an ordination hall, surrounded by moat. Numerous small stupas, of many is only the foundation remain, are scattered around the grounds. The large bell-shaped stupa stands on a square brick base with about 18 meters on each side. 32 elephant sculptures stand around the base. Each elephant seems to be on a small brick niche, only the front part of the elephant is visible. A square portico with brick foundation and remains of laterite pillars surrounding the stupa area at some distance. East of the Stupa are the ruins of a vihara with a Buddha image and round and square laterite pillars.

===Wat Chang Rop===

Wat Chang Rop (also &quot;Rob&quot;) () lies two kilometers west of Sukhothai in the wooded hills as a forest temple. In Sukhothai period the Buddhist monks could be divided according to their way of life in two groups. The first group preferred to live in monasteries within the city and focus on tripitaka study, therefore this group called &quot;city monks&quot; or Kamawasi (). The other group preferring to practice meditation and often lived in monasteries outside the city in quiet forest areas, therefore &quot;forest monks&quot; or Aranyawasi (). Wat Chang Rop was one of the temples for forest monks during that time. The main structure of the temple is a bell-shaped stupa standing on a large square base. There are niches with 24 elephants on the four sides of the stupa. This stupa is probably the first in Sukhothai having the Lanka style. In front of the stupa are the remains of a small vihara with laterite pillars.

===Wat Si Chum===

Wat Si Chum () has a massive mandapa in the middle of the complex which was built in the late 14th century by King Maha Thammaracha II. Inside the mandapa, there is a huge 11 meters wide and 15 meters high seated Buddha image called &quot;Phra Achana&quot;, which was mentioned in Ramkhamhaeng stele. The Mandapa has a square base of 32 meters on each side and 15 meters high, and its walls are three feet thick. In the south wall there is a narrow staircase passage which can be used to reach the roof. In this passage more than 50 slates were discovered on which images from the life of Buddha (Jataka) are engraved. These slates are the oldest surviving examples of Thai art of drawing. East of mandapa are the ruins of vihara with column fragments and three Buddha image pedestals. North of the Mandapa are the ruins of another small vihara and another smaller mandapa with a Buddha image. The entire complex is surrounded by a moat. There is a legend that to boost morale of the ancient soldiers and people, the kings went through the hidden passageway and address the people through a hole, making them believed the voice they were hearing was actually the Buddha&#x27;s.

===Wat Saphan Hin===

Wat Saphan Hin () or Wat Taphan Hin () is located on the 200 metres hill above the plain of Sukhothai. The name of the temple means Stone Bridge Monastery, since there is a slate pathway and staircase in front of the temple complex. In various stone inscriptions found in Sukhothai, this temple was also called &quot;Wat Aranyik&quot;, and since Wat Saphan Hin and Wat Aranyik are only about 500 meters away from each other, so perhaps originally a single temple. When Ramkhamhaeng invited a learned monk from the distant Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south of present-day Thailand to become Sangharaja of Sukhothai, he built Wat Saphan Hin with beautiful vihara for Sangharaja to reside. The temple also has a large 12.5 meters tall standing Buddha image named &quot;Phra Attharot&quot;. Another large Buddha image was found in the mid-20th century. The image has features of Dvaravati style, but more likely made in the 8th century in the kingdom of Srivijaya.

Although the typical Khmer stonework are present everywhere. The buildings are arranged rather scattered over a relatively extensive grounds. There is a small Khmer style ordination hall on a high stone pedestal with eight Bai sema on the separate stone pedestals. Scattered on the wooded grounds are the remains of many unidentifiable stone structures possibly stupa or vihara. Normally monk residence were built from non-durable materials and are therefore no longer discernible. However, at Wat Aranyik there are some small cells made of stone, which could be perhaps once been monk residence.

===Wat Chedi Ngam===

There is a paved road leads up to the temple. The bell-shaped stupa is in Sri Lanka style which is visible from afar. Similar to Wat Chang Rop, the stupa stands on a large, square base of 24 meters on each side. On each side there is a niche which once contained a statue of Buddha. There is a slate tiles floor vihara in the east but few remains are still visible. In the north there are some structures of brick and stone that might once were monk residence. In the vicinity there is a fountain.

Wat Chedi Si Hong () located about two kilometers south of the southern city gate, opposite Wat Chetuphon. The temple was built in the reign of Lithai in the late 14th century. Excavations by the Fine Arts Department in 1963 and from 1970 to 1971, the temple were restored. There is a large, bell-shaped stupa on a high, square base. Around the base of stupa are the remains of unique stucco reliefs depicting many-armed deities with flower vases, their clothing and jewelry attest to the fashion in the time of Sukhothai Kingdom. Between the deities, there are lions and elephants. The vihara is 19 × 25 meters and has rounded laterite pillars and a small porch to the east. The legs of a huge seated Buddha statue can be seen at the western brick wall. A small ordination hall with remains of the boundary stones (Bai Sema) is located in the north of the temple.

Wat Chetuphon () is a temple located about two kilometers south of the southern city wall, which surrounds the historic city of Sukhothai. According to Wat Sorasak Inscription, the temple have been built before 1412 and was restored in 1970-1972 by the Fine Arts Department. A moat and a brick wall surround this temple and in the center stands a large brick mandapa, at the four outer sides they are 14th or early 15th century stucco Buddha sculptures with different postures. The eastern side depicts a walking Buddha, the northern one is sitting, the western one is standing, and the southern one is a reclining Buddha. The two large statues in the west and in the east are called &quot;Phra Attharot&quot;. Another special feature of this temple is the use of slate in the galleries around the mandapa and the door frame. 
To the west, there is a slightly smaller mandapa with a Buddha image, which is called by the locals &quot;Phra Sri Ariya&quot; (Maitreya). Traces of black floral patterns can be identified on the walls. There is a vihara, of which only the foundations and a few fragments of columns can be seen today. About 100 meters south of the moat is an ordination hall on a slightly elevated mound and has two sets of Bai Sema.

===Wat Traphang Ngoen===

Wat Traphang Ngoen () means silver lake monastery. The temple was probably built in the 14th century, around the same time with Wat Mahathat. Wat Traphang Ngoen is oriented so that it is illuminated by both rising and setting sun. The main structures of the temple are a central stupa, the ruins of a vihara, a large Buddha image on a pedestal in the west and an ordination hall on an island in the middle of an artificial lake, &quot;Traphang Ngoen&quot; (Silver Lake). The stupa is typical 10 meters Sukhothai style in the form of a closed lotus flower stands on a square laterite base, followed by five smaller and smaller levels of brick with a plain stucco, standing Buddha image in niches in the four cardinal directions. An ordination hall lies to the east of the main stupa on a small island in the middle of the lake. In the Sukhothai time, the ordination hall was separated by a water area from the rest of the temple complex to symbolize purity. Today only foundation bricks, some fragments of columns and a pedestal on which probably used to be a Buddha image are visible.

===Wat Traphang Thong===

The temple itself is located on an island in a lake and can be reached via a pedestrian bridge from the main road. There is a typical main stupa in Sukhothai style and eight smaller stupas around the main one. A simple ordination hall was founded in 1917 by a governor of Sukhothai. The most important artifact of the temple is a footprint of the Buddha, which is located in a modern mandapa next to the stupa. The footprint was created in 1359 out of dark gray stone by Lithai. Wat Traphang Thong is the only temple of the historical park, in which an active community of monks lives.

===Wat Tuek===

Wat Tuek () lies approximately 400 meters west of the O Gate () outside the old Sukhothai. This temple was founded in the time of Sukhothai Kingdom. In 1970 to 1971 the temple was restored by the Fine Arts Department. On the small temple grounds there is a small mandapa with a side length of eight meters contains a seated Buddha statue made of bricks that was once covered with stucco. The mandapa has three brick walls and a porch on the east side which is similar to Wat Si Chum, but is much smaller scale.

Wat Sorasak () was founded in the time of the Kingdom of Sukhothai during the reign of Sailuethai. In 1955 a stone inscription was discovered by the Fine Arts Department and called &quot;Wat Sorasak stone inscription&quot; also Inscription no. 49. It is now in the Ramkhamhaeng National Museum. Because of this stone inscription, the foundation year of Wat Sorasak can be dated to 1412. Nai Inthara Sorasak, the temple founder and the author of the stone inscription was probably an officer from Ayutthaya Kingdom, sent by Intha Racha to secure the interests of Ayutthaya over Sukhothai. According to the stone inscription, there was a great stupa, vihara, a building for Buddha image in the temple complex. The Lanka style stupa was surrounded by elephants and decorated with a seated Buddha image on a square base. The stupa is reminiscent of Ramkhamhaeng&#x27;s Wat Chang Lom in Si Satchanalai Historical Park. The Fine Arts Department found the remains of elephants statues and fragments of the Buddha image.

===Thuriang Kilns===
The Thuriang Kilns () are ruins of the old celadon factory, which may have been founded in the late 13th century, are situated near the city moat near Wat Phra Phai Luang. This is a site where Sukhothai celadons were made. So far, 49 kilns have been discovered in 3 different areas: 37 lie north of the moat, 9 to the south, near the city wall, and 3 to the east. The vaulted brick kilns measure 1.5 – 2 metres wide and 4.5 metres long. The ceramic wares found here are generally large bowls and jars; they have a matt yellowish grey glaze, and a design, usually of a flower, a fish, or a whirling circle, painted in black.

===Saritphong Dam or Thamnop Phra Ruang===

Saritphong Dam or Thamnop Phra Ruang () is an ancient dam, now restored by the Irrigation Department, comprises earthenworks that stretched between Khao Phra Bat Yai Mountain and Khao Kio Ai Ma Mountain. There was a spillway and pipes to carry water across canals towards the city gates to be further reserved at the Traphang Ngoen and Traphang Thong lakes. Water from these reservoirs was used in the old city and the palace of Sukhothai.

<text>The libertarian perspective on immigration is often regarded as one of the core concepts of libertarian theory and philosophy. There is considerable disagreement among libertarians as to what stance towards immigration best accords with libertarian principles. Some hold that restrictions on immigration are an infringement of the rights of immigrants and other property owners and constitute a threat to individual liberty. Others maintain that open borders amount to a policy of forced integration on the part of the state, and that protecting the rights of property holders requires that present governments adopt much more discriminatory policies on who is allowed to enter a country.

== Libertarian proponents of free immigration ==

Samuel Edward Konkin III has promoted illegal immigration as being a key part of the counter-economy.

Economist and libertarian theorist Walter Block argues that restrictions on immigration are incompatible with libertarianism. In his view, state-enforced national boundaries are arbitrary and violently imposed, and so therefore can provide no justification for restricting the movement of immigrants or emigrants. In accordance with libertarian principles, Block holds that immigration must be permitted insofar as it does not imply aggression. Where there is a property owner willing to take in an immigrant, third parties have no grounds for complaint.

Block further argues that imperfect present conditions of state-imposed migration barriers do not give license to libertarians to oppose open immigration. He holds that libertarians should not try to approximate what &quot;would&quot; be the case in a libertarian society, but should rather advocate those policies that accord directly with the non-aggression principle. This implies opposing state enforced immigration barriers and returning to property owners the right to decide who may or may not enter their territory. Block also holds that arguments to the effect that immigration would erode national institutions or culture are indefensible on libertarian grounds. If neither of these effects of immigration involve the physical invasion of property, then in Block&#x27;s view, libertarians are unjustified in meeting peaceful immigrants with force.

Libertarian author Jacob Hornberger, a proponent of freer immigration policies, argues that open borders is the only libertarian immigration position.

The libertarian Cato Institute has been arguing in favor of liberalized immigration for over forty years and often criticizes the current system as antiquated, unfair and often maliciously conceived.

Political philosopher Adam James Tebble argues that more open borders aid both the economic and institutional development of poorer migrant sending countries, contrary to &quot;brain-drain&quot; critiques of migration.

== Libertarian proponents of restricted immigration ==
Libertarian theorist and economist Murray Rothbard approached the question of immigration through the lens of private property. In &quot;The Ethics of Liberty,&quot; Rothbard argued that the question of immigration could be adequately resolved within a libertarian society, where all streets and land would be privately owned. Immigration would be permitted and encouraged to the extent that there were property owners willing to receive immigrants and allow them to travel on their private roads. Rothbard believed this would lead to a varied arrangement of migration, reflecting the attitudes and desires of property owners in a given area.

Rothbard&#x27;s views on immigration evolved later in his career, as he argued more pointedly that the anarcho-capitalist model would not lend itself to unrestricted immigration. He argued that policies of open immigration enforced by the state are antithetical to liberty:&quot;A totally privatized country would be as &#x27;closed&#x27; as the particular inhabitants and property owners desire. It seems clear, then, that the regime of open borders that exists de facto in the U.S. really amounts to a compulsory opening by the central state, the state in charge of all streets and public land areas, and does not genuinely reflect the wishes of the proprietors.&quot;Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a student of Rothbard and another influential libertarian thinker and economist, is well known for his criticism of unrestricted immigration. He argues that there is no inconsistency in advocating for free trade of good while at the same time arguing for policies of restricted immigration. In his view, free trade always implies a willing buyer and a willing seller. This is not the case with immigration, where immigrants can move on public roads of their own volition and to places where they are not necessarily welcome, amounting to forced integration. As Hoppe states in his article &quot;The Case for Free Trade and Restricted Immigration&quot;, &quot;It is precisely the absolute voluntariness of human association and separation—the absence of any form of forced integration—which makes peaceful relationships—free trade—between racially, ethnically, linguistically, religiously, or culturally distinct people possible.&quot;

Moreover, Hoppe stresses that the political climate in the Western democracies has made the situation even more dire, as the welfare policies of these countries imply that immigration will lead to economic devastation. Hoppe agrees with Rothbard that the ultimate solution to the problem of immigration must be the abolition of government and privatization of all property, including the roads by which immigrants enter a nation and move about within it. This implies that every immigrant will be received by a willing property owner, thus making forced integration impossible. With regards to the anarcho-capitalist model, Hoppe says&quot;Clearly, under this scenario there exists no such thing as freedom of immigration. Rather, there exists the freedom of many independent private property owners to admit or exclude others from their own property in accordance with their own unrestricted or restricted property titles [...] There will be as much immigration or non-immigration, inclusivity or exclusivity, desegregation or segregation, non-discrimination or discrimination based on racial, ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural or whatever other grounds as individual owners or associations of individual owners allow.&quot;Even if the current situation of democratic central states does not approximate the anarcho-capitalist ideal, Hoppe still thinks that one can still advocate for policies that align more closely with libertarianism. He holds that democratic rulers should set policies as though they owned personally the territory over which they preside. This entails strong discrimination along the lines of &quot;skill, character, and cultural compatibility&quot; as the rulers try to maximize the value of their territory. Further, as Hoppe says, this model entails &quot;requiring as necessary, for resident alien status as well as for citizenship, the personal sponsorship by a resident citizen and his assumption of liability for all property damage caused by the immigrant.&quot;

<text>The collared treepie (Dendrocitta frontalis), also known as black-faced treepie or black-browed treepie, is an Asian treepie, a small perching bird of the crow family, Corvidae.

This bird is slightly smaller than a blue jay and has the typical compact body and long tail of this group. The forehead, face and bib are black with the chest, neck and shoulders a light silvery or bluish-grey in color. The back is a warm chestnut brown with similar underparts. The wing coverts are white with the primaries and tail black.

It inhabits a broad band (though often very localized) from the north eastern Indian Himalayas, Bangladesh, Nepal and across into Burma (Myanmar) in hill forests often at quite high elevations.

It feeds mainly on invertebrates of various types, and hawks for termites in flight; it also eats fruits and berries. It probably takes similar overall food types as the other treepies.

The nest is a small, neat structure often placed in bamboo clumps, small trees or bushes at the edge of a clearing. There are usually 3-5 eggs laid.

The voice is described as varied but contains metallic notes as well as the chatter alarm call sounding similar to the other species.

<text>Libertarians promote individual liberty and seek to minimize the role of the state. The abortion debate is mainly within right-libertarianism between cultural liberals and social conservatives as left-libertarians generally see it as a settled issue regarding individual rights, as they support legal access to abortion as part of what they consider to be a woman&#x27;s right to control her body and its functions. Religious right and intellectual conservatives have attacked such libertarians for supporting abortion rights, especially after the demise of the Soviet Union led to a greater divide in the conservative movement between libertarians and social conservatives. Libertarian conservatives claim libertarian principles such as the non-aggression principle (NAP) apply to human beings from conception and that the universal right to life applies to fetuses in the womb. Thus, some of those individuals express opposition to legal abortion. According to a 2013 survey, 5.7/10 of American Libertarians oppose making it more difficult for a woman to get an abortion.

== Support for legal abortion ==
Russian-born American novelist and philosopher, Ayn Rand, argued that the notion of a fetus&#x27;s having a right to life is &quot;vicious nonsense&quot; and stated: &quot;An embryo has no rights. [...] A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born&quot;. She also wrote: &quot;Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered&quot;. Leonard Peikoff, a close associate of Ayn Rand and co-founder of the Ayn Rand Institute, stated that:

Anarcho-capitalist philosopher and Austrian school economist Murray Rothbard wrote that &quot;no being has a right to live, unbidden, as a parasite within or upon some person&#x27;s body&quot; and that therefore the woman is entitled to eject the fetus from her body at any time. However, explaining the right of the woman to &quot;eject the fetus from her body&quot;, Rothbard also wrote that &quot;every baby as soon as it is born and is therefore no longer contained within his mother&#x27;s body possesses the right of self-ownership by virtue of being a separate entity and a potential adult. It must therefore be illegal and a violation of the child&#x27;s rights for a parent to aggress against his person by mutilating, torturing, murdering him, etc.&quot; Rothbard also opposed all federal interference with the right of local governments to fashion their own laws, so he opposed the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision. He believed that states should be able to author their own abortion policies. He also opposed taxpayer funding for abortion clinics, writing &quot;it is peculiarly monstrous to force those who abhor abortion as murder to pay for such murders&quot;.

19th-century individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker initially concluded that no one should interfere to prevent neglect of the child, although they could still repress a positive invasion. However, Tucker, having reconsidered his opinion, resolved that parental cruelty is of non-invasive character and therefore is not to be prohibited. Tucker&#x27;s opinion is grounded on the fact that he viewed the child as the property of the mother while in the womb and until the time of their emancipation (at the age of being able to contract and provide for themselves) unless the mother had disposed of the fruit of her womb by contract. In the meantime, Tucker recognized the right of the mother to dispose of her property as she sees it fit. According to Tucker&#x27;s logic, &quot;the outsider who uses force upon the child invades, not the child, but its mother, and may be rightfully punished for doing so&quot;.

In &quot;The Right to Abortion: A Libertarian Defense&quot;, the Association of Libertarian Feminists created what they call a &quot;systematic philosophical defense of the moral case for abortion from a libertarian perspective&quot;. It concludes: &quot;To sacrifice existing persons for the sake of future generations, whether in slave labor camps for the utopian nightmares of Marxists or fascists, or in unwanted pregnancies, compulsory childbearing, and furtive coat hanger abortions for the edification of fetus-worshippers, is to establish hell on earth&quot;.

&quot;Capitalism Magazine&quot; supports the abortion-rights position, writing:

Harry Browne, the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 1996 and 2000, rejected the terms &quot;pro-life&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot; and stated about abortion: &quot;Whatever we believe abortion is, we know one thing: Government doesn&#x27;t work, and it is as incapable of eliminating abortions as it is of eliminating poverty or drugs&quot;.

The Libertarian Party&#x27;s 2004 presidential candidate Michael Badnarik had a similar position, writing: &quot;I oppose government control over the abortion issue. I believe that giving the government control of this issue could lead to more abortions rather than fewer, because the left-right pendulum of power swings back and forth. This shift could place the power to set policy in the hands of those who demand strict population control. The government that can ban abortion can just as easily mandate abortion, as is currently the case in China&quot;. The party&#x27;s 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson wanted to keep abortion legal.

=== Prior U.S. Libertarian Party national platform ===
The 2012-May 2022 political platform of the Libertarian Party stated, &quot;Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.&quot;

=== Other organizations ===
Other abortion rights libertarian organizations include the Association of Libertarian Feminists and Pro-Choice Libertarians.

== Opposition to legal abortion ==
The anti-abortion libertarian group Libertarians for Life argues that humans in the zygotic, embryonic and fetal stages of development have the same rights as humans in the neonatal stage and beyond. Doris Gordon of the group notes that the principles of both the Libertarian Party and Objectivist ethics require some obligation to children and counter with an appeal to the non-aggression principle:

=== Evictionism ===

Walter Block, Rothbardian writer and professor of economics at Loyola University New Orleans, provides an alternative to the standard choice between &quot;pro-life&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot; which he terms &quot;evictionism&quot;. According to this moral theory, the act of abortion must be conceptually separated into the acts of (a) eviction of the fetus from the womb; and (b) killing the fetus. Building on the libertarian stand against trespass and murder, Block supports a right to the first act, but except in certain circumstances not the second act. He believes the woman may legally abort if (a) the fetus is not viable outside the womb, or (b) the woman has publicly announced her abandonment of the right to custody of a viable fetus, and it has not been claimed.

=== Departurism ===
Departurism is a theory developed by Sean Parr which, like evictionism, holds that the mother may evict but not directly kill the &quot;trespassing&quot; fetus, but, contrary to evictionism, neither may she kill him by eviction. The mother, if her actions are to conform to gentleness (an &quot;ex ante&quot; element of law akin to the &quot;ex post&quot; element proportionality), must allow for the continued departure of the trespasser until such time that eviction no longer entails his death. That is, it is only the fatal (or otherwise seriously injurious) eviction of a fetus during a normal pregnancy that departurism argues is discordant with gentleness and, thus, a NAP-violation.

=== Anti-abortion political officials ===

==== Ron and Rand Paul ====

Anti-abortion Republican and former Libertarian congressman Ron Paul says in &quot;Abortion and Liberty&quot;:
His main position calls for overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and letting the states decide the issue. Ron Paul&#x27;s son, Republican Senator Rand Paul, calls himself &quot;totally pro-life&quot; and supports &quot;any and all legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion&quot;.

==== Bob Barr ====

In 2008, the Libertarian Party candidate for president was Bob Barr, who since 2011 has been a Republican, and who has called abortion &quot;murder&quot; and opposed legalized abortion.

==== Justin Amash ====

Republican-turned-Libertarian Justin Amash opposes abortion and federal funding for abortion. He describes himself as &quot;100 percent pro-life&quot; and in 2017 voted in favor of federal legislation to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Amash voted &quot;present&quot;, rather than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, on the 2011 Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act, which provided for the cessation of federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Although he supports eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, he abstained from defunding legislation, arguing that &quot;legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper&quot; and an &quot;arguably unconstitutional&quot; bill of attainder.

In May 2012, Amash was one of seven Republicans to vote against the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act, which would have made it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman who wants to end a pregnancy based on the gender of the fetus. He criticized the bill as ineffective and virtually impossible to enforce, and said Congress &quot;should not criminalize thought&quot;, while maintaining that he believes &quot;all abortion should be illegal&quot;.

==== Austin Petersen ====

Austin Petersen, presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party in 2016 and Republican candidate for senator in 2018, is a believer and advocate for a consistent life ethic, meaning that he opposes both abortion and the death penalty.

=== Anti-abortion political pundits ===

Talk radio host Larry Elder has argued that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; should be overturned, calling the decision &quot;one of the worst decisions that the Supreme Court ever handed down.&quot; He has called abortion &quot;murder&quot; and believes that abortion laws should be decided at the state level.

Economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell has condemned partial-birth abortion Sowell also condemned sex-selective abortions labeling them &quot;the most basic kind of discrimination&quot;.

Columnist Nat Hentoff was strongly opposed to abortion, and believed that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian.

<text>Pwyll () is an impact crater on the surface of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa. It is thought to be one of the youngest features on the moon. The crater was first observed from Voyager images in 1986, and the name was officially recognized by the IAU in 1997, after Pwyll of Welsh mythology.

==Description==
Pwyll crater is estimated to be 18 million years old or younger. Its visible dark central region is about in diameter, with several small peaks, and a central peak rising to about . Dark material in the center of the crater was exposed as a result of the impact, and may have been excavated from a depth of .

Ejected bright material extends outward from Pwyll in rays that extend as far as , covering the darker reddish surface of Europa. The bright white color suggests a composition of water ice particles. In addition to the white rays, the impact also produced a multitude of smaller secondary craters, which are largest near the center of each ray, and close to the central crater.

<doc id="215699" wikidata="Q6541420" url="?curid=215699" title="Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment">
<text>Most libertarians oppose capital punishment. They argue that capital punishment is an extreme exertion of state power, it is contrary to the values of a free society, authoritarian countries tend to be retentionist, and liberal-democratic societies generally abolitionist.

Proponents of capital punishment believe that such punishment may be justified as a deterrent to particularly atrocious crimes and as a means of keeping dangerous individuals permanently incapacitated. Furthermore, if people commit crimes, they may sacrifice their rights and if the legal system is legitimate, perhaps capital punishment is justified. The U.S. Libertarian Party, a right-libertarian American third party, opposes &quot;the administration of the death penalty by the state&quot; despite the large stake that conservatives would have in abolishing the death penalty.

There is also the fundamental problem of the possibility of error or even the outright framing of the accused. To that effect, lack of trust in government to make decisions (including life-and-death decisions) competently or for the best motives may confound the issue; already deeply distrustful of government, they say, it should not be trusted to be an arbiter of life and death without error. In any case, to anarcho-capitalists making judges, police officers, and other law enforcement personnel just as responsible for their acts as any citizen, with no privilege or special right or exemption, will prevent abuse of force in general, and of deadly force in particular. Walter Block went so far as to say, &quot;We have seen that in the libertarian philosophy, the death penalty is justified for those whose crimes rise to a sufficient degree of severity. Surely, there are heads of state whose evil deeds many times eclipse such a level. Thus, it would altogether be justified to end their lives by violence.&quot;

<doc id="215706" wikidata="Q40392" url="?curid=215706" title="Supermassive black hole">
<text>A supermassive black hole (SMBH or sometimes SBH) is the largest type of black hole, with its mass being on the order of hundreds of thousands, or millions to billions, of times the mass of the Sun (). Black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape, including light. Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. For example, the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, corresponding to the radio source Sagittarius A*. Accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars.

Two supermassive black holes have been directly imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope: the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 and the black hole at the Milky Way&#x27;s center (Sagittarius A*).

==Description==
Supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above 100,000 () solar masses (); some have masses of . Supermassive black holes have physical properties that clearly distinguish them from lower-mass classifications. First, the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for supermassive black holes. The tidal force on a body at a black hole&#x27;s event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the black hole&#x27;s mass: a person at the event horizon of a black hole experiences about the same tidal force between their head and feet as a person on the surface of the Earth. Unlike with stellar-mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole&#x27;s event horizon.

It is somewhat counterintuitive to note that the average density of a SMBH within its event horizon (defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume of space within its Schwarzschild radius) can be smaller than the density of water. This is because the Schwarzschild radius (formula_1) is directly proportional to its mass. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have a lower average density.

The Schwarzschild radius of the event horizon of a nonrotating and uncharged supermassive black hole of around is comparable to the semi-major axis of the orbit of planet Uranus, which is about 19 AU.

Some astronomers refer to black holes of greater than as ultramassive black holes (UMBHs or UBHs), but the term is not broadly used. Possible examples include the black holes at the cores of TON 618, NGC 6166, ESO 444-46 and NGC 4889, which are among the most massive black holes known.

Some studies have suggested that the maximum natural mass that a black hole can reach, while being luminous accretors (featuring an accretion disk), is typically on the order of about . However, a 2020 study suggested even larger black holes, dubbed stupendously large black holes (SLABs), with masses greater than , could exist based on used models; some studies place the black hole at the core of Phoenix A in this category.

==History of research==
The story of how supermassive black holes were found began with the investigation by Maarten Schmidt of the radio source 3C 273 in 1963. Initially this was thought to be a star, but the spectrum proved puzzling. It was determined to be hydrogen emission lines that had been redshifted, indicating the object was moving away from the Earth. Hubble&#x27;s law showed that the object was located several billion light-years away, and thus must be emitting the energy equivalent of hundreds of galaxies. The rate of light variations of the source dubbed a quasi-stellar object, or quasar, suggested the emitting region had a diameter of one parsec or less. Four such sources had been identified by 1964.

In 1963, Fred Hoyle and W. A. Fowler proposed the existence of hydrogen-burning supermassive stars (SMS) as an explanation for the compact dimensions and high energy output of quasars. These would have a mass of about . However, Richard Feynman noted stars above a certain critical mass are dynamically unstable and would collapse into a black hole, at least if they were non-rotating. Fowler then proposed that these supermassive stars would undergo a series of collapse and explosion oscillations, thereby explaining the energy output pattern. Appenzeller and Fricke (1972) built models of this behavior, but found that the resulting star would still undergo collapse, concluding that a non-rotating SMS &quot;cannot escape collapse to a black hole by burning its hydrogen through the CNO cycle&quot;.

Edwin E. Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich made the proposal in 1964 that matter falling onto a massive compact object would explain the properties of quasars. It would require a mass of around to match the output of these objects. Donald Lynden-Bell noted in 1969 that the infalling gas would form a flat disk that spirals into the central &quot;Schwarzschild throat&quot;. He noted that the relatively low output of nearby galactic cores implied these were old, inactive quasars. Meanwhile, in 1967, Martin Ryle and Malcolm Longair suggested that nearly all sources of extra-galactic radio emission could be explained by a model in which particles are ejected from galaxies at relativistic velocities, meaning they are moving near the speed of light. Martin Ryle, Malcolm Longair, and Peter Scheuer then proposed in 1973 that the compact central nucleus could be the original energy source for these relativistic jets.

Arthur M. Wolfe and Geoffrey Burbidge noted in 1970 that the large velocity dispersion of the stars in the nuclear region of elliptical galaxies could only be explained by a large mass concentration at the nucleus; larger than could be explained by ordinary stars. They showed that the behavior could be explained by a massive black hole with up to , or a large number of smaller black holes with masses below . Dynamical evidence for a massive dark object was found at the core of the active elliptical galaxy Messier 87 in 1978, initially estimated at . Discovery of similar behavior in other galaxies soon followed, including the Andromeda Galaxy in 1984 and the Sombrero Galaxy in 1988.

Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees hypothesized in 1971 that the center of the Milky Way galaxy would contain a massive black hole. Sagittarius A* was discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the Green Bank Interferometer of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. They discovered a radio source that emits synchrotron radiation; it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation. This was, therefore, the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in the center of the Milky Way.

The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, provided the resolution needed to perform more refined observations of galactic nuclei. In 1994 the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble was used to observe Messier 87, finding that ionized gas was orbiting the central part of the nucleus at a velocity of ±500 km/s. The data indicated a concentrated mass of lay within a span, providing strong evidence of a supermassive black hole.

Using the Very Long Baseline Array to observe Messier 106, Miyoshi et al. (1995) were able to demonstrate that the emission from an H2O maser in this galaxy came from a gaseous disk in the nucleus that orbited a concentrated mass of , which was constrained to a radius of 0.13 parsecs. Their ground-breaking research noted that a swarm of solar mass black holes within a radius this small would not survive for long without undergoing collisions, making a supermassive black hole the sole viable candidate. Accompanying this observation which provided the first confirmation of supermassive black holes was the discovery of the highly broadened, ionised iron Kα emission line (6.4 keV) from the galaxy MCG-6-30-15. The broadening was due to the gravitational redshift of the light as it escaped from just 3 to 10 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole.

On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released the first horizon-scale image of a black hole, in the center of the galaxy Messier 87. In March 2020, astronomers suggested that additional subrings should form the photon ring, proposing a way of better detecting these signatures in the first black hole image.

== Formation ==
The origin of supermassive black holes remains an active field of research. Astrophysicists agree that black holes can grow by accretion of matter and by merging with other black holes. There are several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or &quot;seeds&quot;, of supermassive black holes. Independently of the specific formation channel for the black hole seed, given sufficient mass nearby, it could accrete to become an intermediate-mass black hole and possibly a SMBH if the accretion rate persists.

Distant and early supermassive black holes, such as J0313–1806, and ULAS J1342+0928, are hard to explain so soon after the Big Bang. Some postulate they might come from direct collapse of dark matter with self-interaction. A small minority of sources argue that they may be evidence that the Universe is the result of a Big Bounce, instead of a Big Bang, with these supermassive black holes being formed before the Big Bounce.

===First stars===
The early progenitor seeds may be black holes of that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a dense stellar cluster undergoing core collapse as the negative heat capacity of the system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds.

Before the first stars, large gas clouds could collapse into a &quot;quasi-star&quot;, which would in turn collapse into a black hole of around . These stars may have also been formed by dark matter halos drawing in enormous amounts of gas by gravity, which would then produce supermassive stars with . The &quot;quasi-star&quot; becomes unstable to radial perturbations because of electron-positron pair production in its core and could collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion (which would eject most of its mass, preventing the black hole from growing as fast).

A more recent theory proposes that SMBH seeds were formed in the very early universe each from the collapse of a supermassive star with mass of around .

===Direct-collapse and primordial black holes===
Large, high-redshift clouds of metal-free gas, when irradiated by a sufficiently intense flux of Lyman–Werner photons, can avoid cooling and fragmenting, thus collapsing as a single object due to self-gravitation. The core of the collapsing object reaches extremely large values of matter density, of the order of about , and triggers a general relativistic instability. Thus, the object collapses directly into a black hole, without passing from the intermediate phase of a star, or of a quasi-star. These objects have a typical mass of about and are named direct collapse black holes.

A 2022 computer simulation showed that the first supermassive black holes can arise in rare turbulent clumps of gas, called primordial halos, that were fed by unusually strong streams of cold gas. The key simulation result was that cold flows suppressed star formation in the turbulent halo until the halo&#x27;s gravity was finally able to overcome the turbulence and formed two direct-collapse black holes of and . The birth of the first SMBHs can therefore be a result of standard cosmological structure formation.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) could have been produced directly from external pressure in the first moments after the Big Bang. These black holes would then have more time than any of the above models to accrete, allowing them sufficient time to reach supermassive sizes. Formation of black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.

The formation of a supermassive black hole requires a relatively small volume of highly dense matter having small angular momentum. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is both the most efficient and the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars.

Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.

===Maximum mass limit===
There is a natural upper limit to how large supermassive black holes can grow. Supermassive black holes in any quasar or active galactic nucleus (AGN) appear to have a theoretical upper limit of physically around for typical parameters, as anything above this slows growth down to a crawl (the slowdown tends to start around ) and causes the unstable accretion disk surrounding the black hole to coalesce into stars that orbit it. A study concluded that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for SMBH masses above this limit exceeds the self-gravity radius, making disc formation no longer possible.

A larger upper limit of around was represented as the absolute maximum mass limit for an accreting SMBH in extreme cases, for example its maximal prograde spin with a dimensionless spin parameter of &quot;a&quot; = 1, although the maximum limit for a black hole&#x27;s spin parameter is very slightly lower at &quot;a&quot; = 0.9982. At masses just below the limit, the disc luminosity of a field galaxy is likely to be below the Eddington limit and not strong enough to trigger the feedback underlying the M–sigma relation, so SMBHs close to the limit can evolve above this.

It was noted that, black holes close to this limit are likely to be rather even rarer, as it would require the accretion disc to be almost permanently prograde because the black hole grows and the spin-down effect of retrograde accretion is larger than the spin-up by prograde accretion, due to its ISCO and therefore its lever arm. This would require the hole spin to be permanently correlated with a fixed direction of the potential controlling gas flow, within the black hole&#x27;s host galaxy, and thus would tend to produce a spin axis and hence AGN jet direction, which is similarly aligned with the galaxy. Current observations do not support this correlation.

The so-called &#x27;chaotic accretion&#x27; presumably has to involve multiple small-scale events, essentially random in time and orientation if it is not controlled by a large-scale potential in this way. This would lead the accretion statistically to spin-down, due to retrograde events having larger lever arms than prograde, and occurring almost as often. There is also other interactions with large SMBHs that trend to reduce their spin, including particularly mergers with other black holes, which can statistically decrease the spin. All of these considerations suggested that SMBHs usually cross the critical theoretical mass limit at modest values of their spin parameters, so that in all but rare cases.
Although modern UMBHs within quasars and galactic nuclei cannot grow beyond around through the accretion disk and as well given the current age of the universe, some of these monster black holes in the universe are predicted to still continue to grow up to stupendously large masses of perhaps during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies in the extremely far future of the universe.

==Activity and galactic evolution==
Gravitation from supermassive black holes in the center of many galaxies is thought to power active objects such as Seyfert galaxies and quasars, and the relationship between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the host galaxy depends upon the galaxy type. An empirical correlation between the size of supermassive black holes and the stellar velocity dispersion formula_2 of a galaxy bulge is called the M–sigma relation.

An AGN is now considered to be a galactic core hosting a massive black hole that is accreting matter and displays a sufficiently strong luminosity. The nuclear region of the Milky Way, for example, lacks sufficient luminosity to satisfy this condition. The unified model of AGN is the concept that the large range of observed properties of the AGN taxonomy can be explained using just a small number of physical parameters. For the initial model, these values consisted of the angle of the accretion disk&#x27;s torus to the line of sight and the luminosity of the source. AGN can be divided into two main groups: a radiative mode AGN in which most of the output is in the form of electromagnetic radiation through an optically thick accretion disk, and a jet mode in which relativistic jets emerge perpendicular to the disk.

=== Mergers and recoiled SMBHs ===

The interaction of a pair of SMBH-hosting galaxies can lead to merger events. Dynamical friction on the hosted SMBH objects causes them to sink toward the center of the merged mass, eventually forming a pair with a separation of under a kiloparsec. The interaction of this pair with surrounding stars and gas will then gradually bring the SMBH together as a gravitationally bound binary system with a separation of ten parsecs or less. Once the pair draw as close as 0.001 parsecs, gravitational radiation will cause them to merge. By the time this happens, the resulting galaxy will have long since relaxed from the merger event, with the initial starburst activity and AGN having faded away.
The gravitational waves from this coalescence can give the resulting SMBH a velocity boost of up to several thousand km/s, propelling it away from the galactic center and possibly even ejecting it from the galaxy. This phenomenon is called a gravitational recoil. The other possible way to eject a black hole is the classical slingshot scenario, also called slingshot recoil. In this scenario first a long-lived binary black hole forms through a merger of two galaxies. A third SMBH is introduced in a second merger and sinks into the center of the galaxy. Due to the three-body interaction one of the SMBHs, usually the lightest, is ejected. Due to conservation of linear momentum the other two SMBHs are propelled in the opposite direction as a binary. All SMBHs can be ejected in this scenario. An ejected black hole is called a runaway black hole.

There are different ways to detect recoiling black holes. Often a displacement of a quasar/AGN from the center of a galaxy or a spectroscopic binary nature of a quasar/AGN is seen as evidence for a recoiled black hole.

Candidate recoiling black holes include NGC 3718, SDSS1133, 3C 186, E1821+643 and SDSSJ0927+2943. Candidate runaway black holes are HE0450–2958, CID-42 and objects around RCP 28. Runaway supermassive black holes may trigger star formation in their wakes. A linear feature near the dwarf galaxy RCP 28 was interpreted as the star-forming wake of a candidate runaway black hole.

=== Hawking radiation ===

Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation reduces the mass and energy of black holes, causing them to shrink and ultimately vanish. If black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, a non-rotating and uncharged stupendously large black hole with a mass of will evaporate in around . Black holes formed during the predicted collapse of superclusters of galaxies in the far future with would evaporate over a timescale of up to .

Some of the best evidence for the presence of black holes is provided by the Doppler effect whereby light from nearby orbiting matter is red-shifted when receding and blue-shifted when advancing. For matter very close to a black hole the orbital speed must be comparable with the speed of light, so receding matter will appear very faint compared with advancing matter, which means that systems with intrinsically symmetric discs and rings will acquire a highly asymmetric visual appearance. This effect has been allowed for in modern computer-generated images such as the example presented here, based on a plausible model for the supermassive black hole in Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way. However, the resolution provided by presently available telescope technology is still insufficient to confirm such predictions directly.

What already has been observed directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with a high concentration of matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or things that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.

=== In the Milky Way ===
Evidence indicates that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A* because:
* The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light-hours ( or 120 AU) from the center of the central object.
* From the motion of star S2, the object&#x27;s mass can be estimated as , or about .
* The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus&#x27; orbit.
* No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain in this volume of space.

Infrared observations of bright flare activity near Sagittarius A* show orbital motion of plasma with a period of at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate SMBH. This emission is consistent with a circularized orbit of a polarized &quot;hot spot&quot; on an accretion disk in a strong magnetic field. The radiating matter is orbiting at 30% of the speed of light just outside the innermost stable circular orbit.

On January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers.

=== Outside the Milky Way ===
Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only for a handful of galaxies; these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, such as NGC 4395. In these galaxies, the root mean square (or rms) velocities of the stars or gas rises proportionally to 1/ near the center, indicating a central point mass. In all other galaxies observed to date, the rms velocities are flat, or even falling, toward the center, making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present.

Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole. The reason for this assumption is the M–sigma relation, a tight (low scatter) relation between the mass of the hole in the 10 or so galaxies with secure detections, and the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulges of those galaxies. This correlation, although based on just a handful of galaxies, suggests to many astronomers a strong connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself.

On March 28, 2011, a supermassive black hole was seen tearing a mid-size star apart. That is the only likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden X-ray radiation and the follow-up broad-band observations. The source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus is estimated to be a SMBH with mass of the order of a . This rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. A significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.

== Individual studies ==
The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way&#x27;s. The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way&#x27;s vicinity appears to be that of Messier 87 (i.e., M87*), at a mass of at a distance of 48.92 million light-years. The supergiant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, contains a black hole measured to be .

Masses of black holes in quasars can be estimated via indirect methods that are subject to substantial uncertainty. The quasar TON 618 is an example of an object with an extremely large black hole, estimated at . Its redshift is 2.219. Other examples of quasars with large estimated black hole masses are the hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255, with an estimated mass of , and the quasar SMSS J215728.21-360215.1, with a mass of , or nearly 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the Milky Way&#x27;s Galactic Center.

Some galaxies, such as the galaxy 4C +37.11, appear to have two supermassive black holes at their centers, forming a binary system. If they collided, the event would create strong gravitational waves. Binary supermassive black holes are believed to be a common consequence of galactic mergers. The binary pair in OJ 287, 3.5 billion light-years away, contains the most massive black hole in a pair, with a mass estimated at . In 2011, a super-massive black hole was discovered in the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, which has no bulge. The precise implications for this discovery on black hole formation are unknown, but may indicate that black holes formed before bulges.

In 2012, astronomers reported an unusually large mass of approximately for the black hole in the compact, lenticular galaxy NGC 1277, which lies 220 million light-years away in the constellation Perseus. The putative black hole has approximately 59 percent of the mass of the bulge of this lenticular galaxy (14 percent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy). Another study reached a very different conclusion: this black hole is not particularly overmassive, estimated at between with being the most likely value. On February 28, 2013, astronomers reported on the use of the NuSTAR satellite to accurately measure the spin of a supermassive black hole for the first time, in NGC 1365, reporting that the event horizon was spinning at almost the speed of light.

In September 2014, data from different X-ray telescopes have shown that the extremely small, dense, ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 hosts a 20 million solar mass black hole at its center, accounting for more than 10% of the total mass of the galaxy. The discovery is quite surprising, since the black hole is five times more massive than the Milky Way&#x27;s black hole despite the galaxy being less than five-thousandths the mass of the Milky Way.

Some galaxies lack any supermassive black holes in their centers. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole of at least , despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; over six times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Despite that, several studies gave very large mass values for a possible central black hole inside A2261-BGC, such as about as large as or as low as . Since a supermassive black hole will only be visible while it is accreting, a supermassive black hole can be nearly invisible, except in its effects on stellar orbits. This implies that either A2261-BGC has a central black hole that is accreting at a low level or has a mass rather below .

In December 2017, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant quasar known by this time, ULAS J1342+0928, containing the most distant supermassive black hole, at a reported redshift of z = 7.54, surpassing the redshift of 7 for the previously known most distant quasar ULAS J1120+0641.


In February 2020, astronomers reported the discovery of the Ophiuchus Supercluster eruption, the most energetic event in the Universe ever detected since the Big Bang. It occurred in the Ophiuchus Cluster in the galaxy NeVe 1, caused by the accretion of nearly of material by its central 7 billion supermassive black hole. The eruption lasted for about 100 million years and released 5.7 million times more energy than the most powerful gamma-ray burst known. The eruption released shock waves and jets of high-energy particles that punched the intracluster medium, creating a cavity about 1.5 million light-years wide – ten times the Milky Way&#x27;s diameter.

In February 2021, astronomers released, for the first time, a very high-resolution image of 25,000 active supermassive black holes, covering four percent of the Northern celestial hemisphere, based on ultra-low radio wavelengths, as detected by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe.

<text>The grey treepie (Dendrocitta formosae), also known as the Himalayan treepie, is an Asian treepie, a medium-sized and long-tailed member of the crow family. The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1863. They are widely distributed along the foothills of the Himalayas in the Indian Subcontinent and extending into Indochina, Nepal, southern mainland China and Taiwan. The populations vary in plumage and several are named as subspecies.

Grey treepies are omnivorous birds mostly thriving among dense foliage and in forests. They sometimes take part in mixed species flocks with laughingthrushes, especially the white-throated laughingthrush. They systematically work together through the hill forests, rhododendrons, oaks and other broad-leaved trees, especially in the mornings.

==Description==

The grey treepie is long and weighs . It is the same size as other &quot;Dendrocitta&quot; species and is separated from them by the overall grey colour of the body. The races in the western part of the distribution have a greyish rump and some grey in tail while the eastern forms have a white rump and a black tail. The face and throat are dark and black with a diffuse mask. The body is grey on the underside becoming whiter towards the vent. The back and scapulars are brownish. The crown and nape are greyish and the black wing has a prominent white carpal patch. The vent is rufous and the outer tail feathers and tips of the central feathers are black. The beak is black, the legs are blackish-brown and the eyes are red or reddish-brown. The two sexes are similar. The juvenile bird is duller, with a browner nape, and all of its feathers have rufous tips.

The species occupies a large geographical range and has several recognised regional forms that differ slightly from one another for instance in colour and tail length. These include &quot;occidentalis&quot; of the western Himalayan foothills (identified by its slightly longer tail), &quot;himalayana&quot; from the central Himalayas east into Thailand and Vietnam. A disjunct population, said to have a smaller or narrower bill, is found in the Eastern Ghats of peninsular India, &quot;sarkari&quot;, that is sometimes subsumed into &quot;himalayana&quot;. The Southeast Asian races include &quot;assimilis&quot;, &quot;sapiens&quot;, &quot;sinica&quot;, &quot;formosae&quot; (the nominate race from Taiwan) and &quot;insulae&quot; (Hainan Island).

It has been suggested that this species forms a superspecies along with &quot;Dendrocitta occipitalis&quot; and &quot;Dendrocitta cinerascens&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The grey treepie is largely arboreal and is found in a wide range of habitats including forest, cultivation and human habitation. The distribution range includes the foothills of the Himalayas, the Eastern Ghats (India), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, China, Hainan, Taiwan and northern Indochina. In the Himalayas, it is found up to above sea level, and in southeastern China, it is found between and .

==Behaviour and ecology==

This treepie is mostly an arboreal feeder but will take some food from the ground, especially in cultivated regions. It eats a wide range of insects and other invertebrates, berries, nectar, grain and other seeds, and also small reptiles, eggs and nestlings. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks.

In the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal, they are known to breed from 2000 to 6000 feet high mainly during the months of May to July. The nest is a shallow cup lined with hair and is built in trees and bushes or clumps of bamboo with 3-4 eggs per clutch. The eggs can be whitish, buffish or pale green, with brown or grey spots. Both the male and female build the nest and feed the young birds.

The voice is described as harsh and grating, but like other species is quite varied and includes a grating &quot;k-r-r-r-r&quot; sound as well as more melodious notes not unlike those of the rufous treepie. These include a &quot;tiddly-aye-kok&quot;, &quot;ko-ku-la&quot; and barking &quot;braap...braap...braap&quot; calls.

==Status==
The global population size is not known. In China, there are an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 breeding pairs, and the population size in Taiwan is estimated at 10,000 to 100,000 breeding pairs. The population in Hainan may be endangered by habitat destruction. The species has a large range, and the population decline does not appear to be very rapid, so the IUCN Red List has assessed the species to be of least concern.

<text>A blood sausage, also known as a blutwurst sausage, is a sausage filled with blood that is cooked or dried and mixed with a filler until it is thick enough to solidify when cooled. Most commonly, the blood of pigs, sheep, lamb, cow, chicken, or goose is used.

In Europe and the Americas, typical fillers include meat, fat, suet, bread, cornmeal, onion, chestnuts, barley, oatmeal, and buckwheat. On the Iberian Peninsula and in Latin America and Asia, fillers are often made with rice. Sweet variants with sugar, honey, orange peel, and spices are also regional specialties.

In many languages, there is a general term such as &quot;blood sausage&quot; (American English) that is used for all sausages that are made from blood, whether or not they include non-animal material such as bread, cereal, and nuts. Sausages that include such material are often referred to with more specific terms, such as &quot;black pudding&quot; in English. Other varieties of blood sausage include &quot;boudin rouge&quot; (Creole and Cajun), &quot;rellena&quot; or &quot;moronga&quot; (Mexico), and &quot;sanganel&quot; (Friuli).

== Africa ==
=== Kenya ===
&quot;Mutura&quot; is a traditional blood sausage dish among the people of urban Kenyan regions, although recently its popularity has spread throughout Kenya. It is made with meat, blood, and spices all encased in the animal&#x27;s intestines or stomach. In Kenya fillers include fresh minced goat, beef, mutton, fat, and red onions.

Nowadays many types of mutura, especially commercial street food versions, do not contain blood. The meat used in the filling can be any fleshy part, but like any other type of sausage, prime cuts are not ordinarily used for the stuffing. Instead the tougher, leaner cuts – for example the neck – are trimmed off the bone. The casing for the stuffing is the stomach sac and larger intestines. These are flushed many times with water to clean them.

The meat for the stuffing is finely chopped or minced, and the mandatory fat is often trimmed from other parts. The meat is slightly fried, mixed with finely chopped red onions, salt and optionally fresh chili. Other additions include freshly chopped coriander (dhania or cilantro), garlic, pepper, and even beef stock. This is then mixed thoroughly with the fresh blood from the animal, and stuffed into the stomach and intestines, with the openings sewn or tied together with string.

The sausage is boiled in a large pot (often with other parts of the animal not roasted and used to make soup) for 30–45 minutes, and roasted over coals till brown. Sliced, it is served with kachumbari, an onion based salad consisting of tomatoes, red onions and fresh coriander, a bit of chili and squeeze of lemon. The accompanying starch is ugali.

== Americas ==

 &quot;Morcilla&quot; is served in many areas of Latin America. &quot;Morcilla&quot; is sometimes made with a filler of rice and/or onions, and seasoned with paprika and other spices.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, blood sausage is known as &quot;morcilla&quot;. Puerto Rican blood sausage is made with rice, culantro, cilantro, garlic, and cubanelle pepper. Some contain paprika and annatto. Morcilla is especially popular during Christmas.

Blood sausages are very difficult to find in US supermarkets. Brussels and Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, are both home to local grocers who produce blood sausage, due to their large Belgian American populations. Supermarkets throughout Maine also carry locally produced blood pudding due to the state&#x27;s large French Canadian population. In southeastern Michigan, Polish-style &quot;kaszanka&quot; can be found in supermarkets throughout the year and is very popular.

An Italian-American version of blood sausage in the San Francisco Bay Area is called &quot;biroldo&quot; and has pine nuts, raisins, spices, and pig snouts and is made using either pig&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s blood. German-style blood sausage and Zungenwurst can be found in Fresno and Santa Rosa, where Russian and Armenian delis offer a wide range of Central European foods. Alpine Village in Torrance, California, used to have Blutwurst due to a considerable German-American population in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County.

Cajun &quot;boudin&quot; is a fresh sausage made with green onions, pork, pork liver (making it somewhat gritty or grainy), and rice. Pig&#x27;s blood was sometimes added to produce &quot;boudin rouge&quot;, but this tradition became increasingly rare after the mid-twentieth century due to the decline of the &quot;boucherie&quot; (traditional communal butchering) and government health regulations prohibiting the transportation of raw blood. As a result, Cajun &quot;boudin&quot; is now usually made without blood; however, blood or &quot;black&quot; &quot;boudin&quot; can still be purchased.

==== Mexico ====

In the Yucatán Peninsula, &quot;morcilla&quot; is made exclusively from pig&#x27;s blood and once deep fried it is served with a mix of pickled onions, cilantro and spices. It is always consumed in the form of tacos and paired with fresh habanero peppers.

In Central Mexico, &quot;morcilla&quot; is known as &quot;moronga&quot;.

=== Central America and the Caribbean ===

==== Caribbean ====

In Antigua, rice pudding is a local delicacy and it is prepared the same way as blood sausage.

In Barbados, blood sausage, also called pudding, is made with sweet potato (&quot;batata&quot;), pig&#x27;s blood and onions, seasoned with peppers and other herbs and stuffed in pig intestines. Traditionally pig&#x27;s blood was used to darken the mixture but Browning sauce (caramelized sugar) is sometimes used as a substitute. It is normally served with &quot;souse&quot;, which is pickled pig&#x27;s feet, pig&#x27;s ears and other trimmings. The cooked meat is cut into bite-sized pieces and soaked in a brine made of water, lime juice, cucumbers, hot pepper, and specially prepared seasonings. Blood sausage and souse, more commonly known as pudding and souse, is a Bajan delicacy usually prepared on weekends and special occasions.

In the French Antilles, &quot;boudin créole&quot;, or &quot;boudin antillais&quot; is very popular, this being the French &quot;boudin noir&quot; with local Caribbean chilli and other spices.

In Trinidad and Tobago, the local style of blood sausage is heavily seasoned with local peppers and traditionally prepared from pig&#x27;s blood, often replaced by pig&#x27;s liver today. It is sold by local producers as a popular accompaniment to rolls of crusty hops bread or served as an accompaniment to &quot;trotter souse&quot;, a stew based on trotters.

In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, it is served fried and mostly consumed during the holidays.

==== Central America ====

In Panama, blood sausage is called &quot;morcilla&quot;, &quot;rellena&quot; or &quot;tubería negra&quot;, and is usually filled with rice.

In El Salvador and Nicaragua, it is called &quot;moronga&quot;.

In Honduras and Guatemala both &quot;moronga&quot; and &quot;morcilla&quot; are used.

In Costa Rica, blood sausage is called &quot;morcilla&quot; or &quot;moronga&quot;; but unlike the rest of Latin America, it does not contain rice or other cereals, it is similar to German blood sausage called &quot;Blutwurst&quot;.

=== South America ===

==== Andean ====
In Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia the blood sausage is also called &quot;morcilla&quot;, and is usually filled with rice.

In Colombia, &quot;morcilla&quot; can have rice, green peas, cilantro or culantro, and is often eaten as an appetizer called &quot;picada&quot; or with the traditional dishes &quot;Bandeja Paisa&quot; or &quot;Fritanga&quot;. In Venezuela, &quot;morcilla&quot; is often served with &quot;parrilla&quot; (barbecue).

==== Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay ====
&quot;Morcilla&quot; is also eaten inside a sandwich called &quot;morcipán&quot;, especially in the Río de la Plata. &quot;Morcilla&quot; is a component of the &quot; asado criollo&quot;, a regional mixed grill or barbecue meal. In Uruguay and in Argentina, a sweet version, usually called &quot;morcilla vasca&quot;, including raisins and pine nuts is popular; some vendors even add chocolate, caramelised orange peels, peanuts, and other dried fruits. Uruguayans usually are fond of sweet or salty &quot;morcilla&quot;, and most restaurants and supermarkets carry both versions. In Paraguay, it is mostly known under the name &quot;mbusia&quot;, a guaranization of the word &quot;morcilla&quot;.

==== Brazil ====

In Brazil there is a version of the blood sausage called &quot;chouriço&quot; or &quot;morcela&quot; (sometimes the Castillian Spanish version &quot;morcilla&quot; is used as well), consisting of a fresh sausage made of the blood and fat from pork and usually rice. It is a variation of the Portuguese blood sausage, and it is known for its deep dark color. In some regions, it is popular on barbecues (&quot;Churrascos&quot;) as a starter.

==== Chile ====

In Chile, the blood sausage is called &quot;prieta&quot; (a synonym of &quot;negra&quot;, black) and tends to have a very thick skin, so is eaten cut open lengthwise. Apart from blood and a little fat, &quot;prietas&quot; may contain a variety of ingredients, such as chopped onion and spices, cabbage, peppers, watercress, rice, meat or even dried fruit or nuts. &quot;Prietas&quot; or &quot;morcillas&quot; are part of the Chilote tradition of &quot;reitimiento&quot; involving the slaughter and preparation of a pig.

Prietas are easily found at supermarkets throughout the country and are available from practically any butcher.

Once the blood had solidified, the sausage was cut into circular slices and served with soy sauce. Matagi hunters of the former Dewa and Mutsu Provinces are known to have made blood sausage using deer intestine and , or dehydrated boiled rice, as filler. Blood sausage is believed to have been introduced to Japan from the Jurchens.

== Europe ==

=== Central and Eastern Europe ===
Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, blood sausage, known as &quot;kishka&quot; (meaning &quot;intestine&quot;), is made with pig&#x27;s blood and buckwheat kasha. It is also known in Russia as &quot;krovyanka&quot; (кровянка), or &quot;krovyanaya kolbasa&quot; (кровяная колбаса, literally &quot;blood sausage&quot;) and includes buckwheat as a main filler, instead of oats or oatmeal. In Belarus it&#x27;s called &quot;kryvianaja kaŭbasa&quot; (крывяная каўбаса) or &quot;kryvianka&quot; (крывянка). In Ukraine it&#x27;s called &quot;krov&#x27;yanka&quot; (кров&#x27;янка) or &quot;kryvava kyshka&quot; (кривава кишка), and &quot;kiszka&quot; or &quot;kaszanka&quot; in Poland; &quot;krvavnička&quot; in Slovakia and &quot;krvavica&quot; in Slovenia, &quot;krupniok&quot; in Silesia. Polish &quot;salceson&quot; (&quot;black&quot; and &quot;Brunszwicki&quot;) are a type of head cheese (&quot;brawn&quot;) that contains blood. In Hungary, &quot;véres hurka&quot; is typically made with pig&#x27;s blood and barleycorn or cubed bread (typically zsemle) as filler as such also known as &quot;zsemlés hurka&quot; and &quot;gerslis hurka&quot;. In Bulgaria, &quot;karvavitsa&quot; (кървавица) is usually prepared with pig&#x27;s blood, fat and a variety of mountain herbs and spices and eaten warm during the winter.

In Romania, the traditional &quot;sângerete&quot; (from &quot;sânge&quot;, &quot;blood&quot; in Romanian) is made from shoulder butt pork meat, pork blood and a filler such as pre-boiled rice seasoned with pepper, garlic and basil. It has many regional variants, but the most common are the &quot;sângerete&quot; from Transylvania.

Similarly, in Czech cuisine, &quot;jelito&quot; is made from second-rate pork, pig&#x27;s blood and peeled barley; the stuffing served by itself, unformed, is called &quot;prejt&quot;.

=== Northern Europe ===

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, &quot;blodpølse&quot; is made from pigs&#x27;s blood and suet, rye flour, brown sugar, raisins, salt, cinnamon and cardamom stuffed into natural or artificial intestines. It is usually boiled in its skin, eaten hot or cold, sometimes sliced and fried, served with syrup, cinnamon and stewed apples.

==== Estonia ====

In Estonia, &quot;verivorst&quot; (blood sausage) is made of pig&#x27;s blood, barley groats, pork, marjoram and other flavourings. It is sold and eaten mostly in winter, being a traditional Christmas food. At that time there is a large variety of &quot;verivorst&quot; in stores, ranging in shapes and sizes. &quot;Verivorst&quot; is usually cooked in an oven, but sometimes also fried in a pan. &quot;Verivorst&quot; is often eaten together with lingonberry jam, but occasionally also with butter or sour cream. Another similar dish is called &quot;verikäkk&quot; (black pudding, or blood dumpling, depending on the shape). The popularity of &quot;verikäkk&quot; has decreased during the past decades (possibly because of its less appealing commercial appearance) and has mostly been substituted by &quot;verivorst&quot;.

==== Finland ====

&quot;Mustamakkara&quot; (literally &quot;black sausage&quot;) is a roasted sausage containing pig&#x27;s blood and very similar to Estonian &quot;verivorst&quot;. The sausage is said to originate from Tampere and is considered an integral part of the city&#x27;s culture.

A dish similar to the British black pudding is also made by making batter out of pig&#x27;s blood and baking it like pancakes. Traditionally, rye flour or oatmeal is used and minced onion is added to the mix. This dish is called &quot;veriohukainen&quot; or &quot;verilettu&quot; (blood pancake). &quot;Rössypottu&quot; is a traditional soup in northern Finland with blood pudding as a main ingredient.

Most blood sausage dishes in Finland are often eaten with lingonberry jam to sweeten the taste.

==== Iceland ====
In Iceland, &quot;blóðmör&quot; is one of two types of &quot;slátur&quot;. It is made from lamb&#x27;s blood and suet, rye flour and oats, traditionally stuffed into pouches sewn from the lamb&#x27;s stomach. It is usually boiled in its skin, eaten hot or cold, sometimes sliced and fried. After cooking, it is often preserved in fermented whey and acquires a distinct sour taste.

==== Ireland and the United Kingdom ====
Black pudding is the version of blood sausage native to the British Isles. While the term &quot;blood sausage&quot; in English is understood, it is applied only to foreign usage (e.g., in the story &quot;The Name-Day&quot; by Saki), or to similar blood-based sausages elsewhere in the world. Black pudding is generally made from pork blood and a relatively high proportion of oatmeal. In the past it was occasionally flavoured with pennyroyal, differing from continental European versions in its relatively limited range of ingredients and reliance on oatmeal and barley instead of onions to absorb the blood. It can be eaten cold, as it is cooked in production, grilled, fried or boiled in its skin. It is often served sliced and fried or grilled as part of a traditional full breakfast, a tradition that followed British and Irish emigrants around the world. Black pudding is now part of the local cuisine of New Zealand and the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Stornoway black pudding produced on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, is one of the most renowned varieties and has been granted Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin (PGI) status. Ireland also has two distinctive varieties of black pudding: Sneem Black Pudding from County Kerry, and drisheen, which is distinguished by its gelatinous texture.

The similar white pudding (mealie pudding) is a further important feature of the traditional Northumbrian, Scottish, Irish and Newfoundland breakfast. Black and white pudding, as well as a third variant, red pudding, is served battered in some chip shops in England, Scotland and Ireland as an alternative to fish and chips.

==== Latvia ====

In Latvia, blood sausage is either called &quot;asinsdesa&quot; (blood sausage) or &quot;putraimu desa&quot; (groat sausage) because of the added barley groats. It is usually served with lingonberry jam and sour cream.

==== Sweden ====
&quot;Blodpudding&quot; is a traditional medieval dish still popular in Sweden. The exact proportions and ingredients vary, partly according to regional preference, but generally it is made from pig&#x27;s blood, milk, rye or barley flour, diced lard, either beer or &quot;svagdricka&quot;, treacle and onion, flavoured with allspice and marjoram. It is then poured into forms and oven-baked in a waterbath. Most of the &quot;blodpudding&quot; consumed today is made on industrial basis.

When prepared for serving, it is sliced and fried. The style of serving and accompaniments vary across the country, and it is not uncommon to have the &quot;blodpudding&quot; act as the meat in a meal. Nationally, the common way is to serve it with lingonberry jam, grated carrots and ice cold milk to drink. Fried bacon or pork side is also common. In Scania, the lingonberry jam is often replaced by finely sliced apples, fried along with the pork.

Other blood-based foods include &quot;blodkorv&quot; (blood sausage) which differs from &quot;blodpudding&quot; by having raisins, pork tallow and apple sauce in it, &quot;blodplättar&quot; (blood pancakes, similar to the original Finnish dish &quot;veriohukainen&quot; above) and &quot;blodpalt&quot;. There is also a soup made from blood, called &quot;svartsoppa&quot; (black soup).

=== Southern Europe ===

==== Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Slovenia ====
A similar blood sausage to &quot;karvavitsa&quot;, called &quot;krvavica&quot; (крвавица), made out of similar ingredients, is eaten in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia in wintertime, usually with sauerkraut and potatoes.

==== Italy ====

In Italy, regional varieties of blood sausage are known as &quot;sanguinaccio&quot;. In Tuscany, &quot;&quot; is a sausage made with pig&#x27;s blood and fat cooked in a pig&#x27;s stomach. It is not reheated and is often spread on bread. It is found only in the south of Tuscany in the winter months and even there it can be difficult to come by. &quot;Biroldo&quot; is another type of black pudding which can be found in Tuscany, while the version made in southern Lombardy is called &quot;marsapan&quot;.

&quot;Migliaccio&quot; is a black pudding that is traditionally prepared in winter in Romagna. It is a sweet pudding with a thick black filling made with pig&#x27;s blood, sugar, breadcrumbs, almonds, chocolate, butter and spices contained in a thin pastry crust. A similar pudding is made throughout southern Italy, generally called &quot;sanguinaccio&quot; or &quot;sanguinaccio dolce&quot;.

==== Portugal ====
In Portuguese cuisine, there are many varieties of blood sausage. Sausages made of blood are usually called &quot;morcela&quot; (for the larger variety) and &quot;negrinha or negrito&quot; (from Portuguese &quot;negro&quot; that means dark or black, for the thinner variety). There are many varieties around the Portuguese-speaking world. In Portugal proper, there are local varieties from different regions of mainland Portugal, including from Guarda, Portalegre, Estremoz and Borba, as well as from the Azores. A variety of morcela made with rice, &quot;morcela de arroz&quot; (rice blood sausage), is typically associated with Tomar, Leiria, Porto de Mós, Fundão and Belmonte. The morcela is made with a combination of different pork parts, namely blood and pork fat cut into pieces, seasoned with ground pepper, salt, garlic, dried garlic, and spices (including cloves and cumin), as well as wine in the pig&#x27;s blood. The morcela is a smoked sausage, is black and has a glossy surface, while its dark interior is marbled with fat. There is also a type of black chouriço, also a smoked blood sausage because it is made with pig blood together with pig meat. It is called &quot;chouriço de sangue&quot;. Places like Melgaço and several other localities in Northern Portugal, as well as in Beiras and Alentejo, are famed for its production.

==== Spain ====

Spanish &quot;morcilla&quot; has many variants. The most well-known and widespread is &quot;morcilla de Burgos&quot; which contains mainly pork blood and fat, rice, onions, and salt, and is produced in two varieties: cylindrical and gut-shaped. In Albacete and La Mancha, the &quot;morcilla&quot; is filled with onions instead of rice, which completely changes the texture. In Extremadura the creamy &quot;morcilla patatera&quot; includes roughly mashed potatoes. In the northern regions and the Canary Islands there is a sweet variety known as &quot;morcilla dulce&quot;. Other varieties introduce breadcrumbs, pine nuts, and almonds, and vary the proportions of the other ingredients or flavourings, some of them considered delicacies.

There are other similarly famous kinds being made in Asturias (slightly darker and smaller, used for bean and chickpea stews) and León (without rice, grilled &amp; spread on toasted bread). Other less popular varieties may add cumin to the pudding mixture, but this is not a standard practice. The cooking method for consumption is typically frying, stewing, grilling or roasting, often in served in slices and either as a side dish or on its own. There are many derivative foods made from morcilla, such as omelettes, stuffed red pepper, puff pastry, pizza, flavoured nachos, croquettes, and a range of fillings for different dishes.

In Galicia, blood pancakes are called filloas.

==== Malta ====
The Maltese blood sausage is known as (plural: ). It was first described in the 1750s in Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius De Soldanis’s &quot;Damma tal-Kliem Kartaginis mscerred fel fomm tal Maltin u Ghaucin&quot;, listing words of Carthagenese oriġin spoken widely across mainland Malta and the island of Gozo. The production of blood sausages in Malta was temporarily halted in 2004 when Malta joined the European Union, as no adequate machinery was available in the country to ensure that the blood was handled according to EU standards. However, it was reintroduced on the local market in 2024, when appropriate equipment was procured by the state-run slaughterhouse to gather the blood in appropriate sanitary conditions.

=== Western Europe ===

==== Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg ====
In Belgium and the Netherlands, exist 2 varieties one called &quot;bloedworst&quot; and the other is called &quot;beuling&quot;. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Bloedworst&quot; is a big sausage with white chunks of suet, which is sold in slices of roughly . It is generally pan fried; sometimes apples are cooked alongside or on top of the pieces. It is also eaten with apple sauce, brown sugar, syrup or red cabbage. As a cold cut, thin slices are eaten as a sandwich topping. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Beuling&quot; also called &quot;Zwarte pens&quot; (as opposed to the white variety that is referred to as &quot;Witte pens&quot;) are individual blood sausages the size of a banana, the filling of which is uniform.
&lt;br&gt;
Both are made of blood, from predominantly cows or pigs, sometimes sheep or horse blood are used in specialty products. The blood is mixed with breadcrum, wheat- or potatoflour, or any combination thereof, and fatty parts of the head, belly and organ meat such as lung, tongue, heartmuscle, and spleen.

The Luxembourg träipen includes green cabbage, and is served pan fried with apple sauce. It was eaten in church in the Middle Ages during Carnival and is still consumed for breakfast, baked with apples and topped with apple syrup, during Carnival in the Dutch province of Limburg.

==== France and southern Belgium ====
In France and Wallonia (south Belgium) &quot;boudin noir&quot; is traditionally prepared in &quot;charcuteries&quot;, shops that prepare mainly pork products (and sometimes duck and game), but also sell smoked and dried sausages, pâtés, and terrines, along with prepared salads. It is usually called &quot;boudin noir&quot; and is often made with cream with apples or onions as a filler. It is generally served with either cooked apples, mashed potatoes or both, and is appreciated by combining either the apples or mashed potatoes with each bite of &quot;boudin&quot;, which has been gently heated and browned in butter. In France also, there are many different regional &quot;Boudins Noirs&quot; such as the large &quot;Boudin du Béarn&quot; with pork meat pieces usually eaten cold. The French &quot;Confrérie des Chevaliers du Goûte-Boudin&quot; (Brotherhood of the Knights of Blood Sausage Tasting) in Mortagne-au-Perche in southern Normandy holds an annual contest of international blood sausage specialities. Boudin is considered the emblematic staple of the French Foreign Legion, and gives its name to the Legion&#x27;s anthem.

==== Germany and Austria ====
The most common variant of German &quot;Blutwurst&quot; is made from pork rind, pork blood and regionally different fillers such as barley. Though already cooked and &quot;ready to eat&quot; it is sometimes served warm, similar to the style in France. In the Rhineland, where it is also traditionally made from horse meat, fried &quot;Blutwurst&quot; or &quot;Flönz&quot; is a constituent of various dishes. In particular in Cologne, the traditional &quot;Himmel und Erde&quot; (Heaven and Earth) combines apple sauce, mashed potatoes and &quot;Blutwurst&quot; served hot on one plate. In Berlin, hot &quot;Blutwurst&quot; mixed together with liverwurst and potatoes is called &quot;Tote Oma&quot; (&quot;Dead Grandma&quot;).

Other German variants are &quot;Zungenwurst&quot;, which is &quot;Blutwurst&quot; mixed with pieces of pickled ox tongue, and &quot;Beutelwurst,&quot; which is pressed in a linen or paper bag (&quot;Beutel&quot;). A variety of &quot;Blutwurst&quot;, the &quot;Rotwurst&quot; from Thuringia (&quot;Thüringer Rotwurst&quot;), has geographical indication protection under EU law, with PGI status. &quot;Kartoffelwurst&quot; (potato sausage) is a post-World War II variety popular in the Palatinate, a reduced fat version of &quot;Blutwurst&quot; using potato cubes instead of bacon.

In Austria it is often prepared in a dish known as &quot;Blunzngröstl&quot;, which consists of pan-fried potatoes and blood sausage. This is usually served with freshly grated horseradish.

===Symbol of Carnival===
Many Roman Catholics celebrate Mardi Gras, the last day of carnival, (Literally meaning Carne Vale, farewell to Meat in Italian) with rituals involving the blood sausage. For example, in Spain, they celebrate carnival with &quot;judías con morcilla&quot; (morcilla is a type of blood sausage) followed by the funeral of the sardina.
Likewise, in Belgium and the Netherlands, the Bloodsausage is a symbol for Carnival (most likely following the invasion of Spain during the Eighty Years&#x27; War).

François Rabelais in France mentions in his &quot;fourth book&quot; (1552) carnavalesque figures called &quot;forest-dwelling Blood-puddings&quot; (Saulcis- sons montigènes, Boudins sylvatiques) as a farce representing the Swiss and German Protestants.

=== Additional varieties ===
Other varieties of blood sausage include &quot;blodpølse&quot; (Norway and Denmark), &quot;tongenworst&quot; (with added pigs tongues) (Netherlands), &quot;krvavica&quot; (Balkans), &quot;krovianka&quot; (Belarus, Russia and Ukraine), and &quot;vėdarai&quot; (Lithuania).

<text>Orpheus ( ; also the title used in the UK) is a 1950 French romantic fantasy drama film directed by Jean Cocteau and starring Jean Marais. It is the central part of Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Orphic Trilogy&quot;, alongside &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1930) and &quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960). Set in contemporary Paris, the film is a variation on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and is partially based on Cocteau&#x27;s 1926 play of the same title.

==Plot==
Orpheus, a famous poet, visits the Café des Poètes. A Princess and Cégeste, a handsome young poet whom she supports, arrive. The drunken Cégeste starts a brawl. When the police arrive and attempt to take Cégeste into custody, he breaks free and flees, only to be run down by two motorcycle riders. The Princess has the police place Cégeste into her car and orders Orpheus to come with her as a witness. Once in the car, Orpheus discovers Cégeste is dead. They drive to a chateau accompanied by the two motorcycle riders as abstract poetry plays on the radio.

At the ruined chateau, the Princess reanimates Cégeste into a zombie-like state, and they and the motorcycle riders (who are the Princess&#x27; henchmen) disappear into a mirror, leaving Orpheus alone. He wakes in a desolate landscape, where he stumbles on the Princess&#x27; chauffeur, Heurtebise, who has been waiting for Orpheus to arrive. Heurtebise drives Orpheus home, where Orpheus&#x27; pregnant wife Eurydice, a police inspector, and Eurydice&#x27;s friend Aglaonice (head of the “League of Women” and apparently in love with Eurydice) discuss Orpheus&#x27; mysterious disappearance. Orpheus refuses to explain the details of the previous night to his wife or the inspector. He invites Heurtebise to live in his house and to store the Princess&#x27; Rolls-Royce in Orpheus&#x27; garage. Eurydice attempts to tell Orpheus that she is pregnant, but he rebuffs her.

While Heurtebise falls in love with Eurydice, Orpheus becomes obsessed with listening to the abstract poetry which only comes through the Rolls&#x27; radio, and it is revealed that the Princess is an incarnation of Death.

When Eurydice is killed by Death&#x27;s henchmen, Heurtebise proposes to lead Orpheus into the Underworld in order to reclaim her. Orpheus reveals that he has fallen in love with Death, who has visited him in his dreams. Orpheus enters the afterlife by donning a pair of surgical gloves and walking into a mirror, and he and Heurtebise traverse the Zone, a ruined city inhabited by people apparently unaware that they are dead.

In the Underworld, Orpheus finds himself as a plaintiff before a tribunal which interrogates all parties involved in the death of Eurydice. The tribunal declares that Death has illegally claimed Eurydice, and they return her to life on one condition: Orpheus may not look upon her again, or else she will return to the underworld. Orpheus agrees and returns home with Eurydice and Heurtebise, who has been assigned by the tribunal to assist them.

Eurydice visits the garage where Orpheus listens to the car radio and sits in the back seat. When Orpheus glances at her in the mirror, she disappears. A mob from the Café des Poètes arrives targeting Orpheus, who they accuse of murdering Cégeste. Orpheus confronts them, armed with a pistol given to him by Heurtebise, but he is disarmed and shot. Orpheus dies and finds himself in the Underworld. He declares his love to Death, who has decided to die herself in order that he might become an “immortal poet”. The tribunal sends Orpheus and Eurydice back to the living world with no memories of the previous events; Orpheus learns that he is to be a father, and his life begins anew. Death and Heurtebise walk through the ruins of the Underworld to await judgment from the tribunal.

==Production==

In his autobiography, the actor Jean-Pierre Aumont claimed that Cocteau wrote the film for him and his then-wife Maria Montez but decided to use other actors.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place from September 12 to November 16, 1949, in Paris, at Porte des Lilas for the opening scene in Café des Poètes (named specifically for the film), meant to evoke the Café de Flore of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district and Place des Vosges when Orpheus tries to catch up with the princess who appears and disappears around the marketplace. Filming also took place in the Vallée de Chevreuse and in particular in the ruins of the Saint-Cyr military academy, bombed during the Second World War. In the ruins, the sound recording was often interfered with by the whistles of locomotives passing nearby. During editing, Cocteau did not erase this unplanned sound effects, but rather preserved them as a “natural echo of the modern world”. It was on a 1,500 m2 set in the Pathé Cinémas studios on rue Francoeur in Paris that Cocteau had a sloping alley built, down which Jean Marais and François Périer ran down. Director Jean-Pierre Melville appears as a hotel manager and Jean-Pierre Mocky as a sidekick, sitting next to the gang leader standing on the bar terrace.

=== Effects ===
The film is noted for its wide array of practical and post-production effects, notably “liquid” mirrors (represented by close-ups of a vat of mercury), landscapes filmed in negative, sequences shot in reverse, a vertical shot of a plateau on the ground (when Orpheus and Heurtebise return for the second time to the Underworld), superimposition (characters appearing or disappearing, Heurtebise being able to move while seemingly standing still) and mirrors spontaneously breaking.

Marais wrote that “Cocteau had certain sets built so that the walls of the houses became the floor and the ground became the wall: thus our movement was made more difficult and was restricted by gravity. That day, I saw that the technical team was sceptical, but the next day, at the screening, they were howling with enthusiasm.”

==Themes and interpretations==
Cocteau wrote in &quot;The Art of Cinema&quot;:

“The three basic themes of &quot;Orphée&quot; are:
#The successive deaths through which a poet must pass before he becomes, in that admirable line from Mallarmé, tel qu&#x27;en lui-même enfin l&#x27;éternité le change—changed into himself at last by eternity.
#The theme of immortality: the person who represents Orphée&#x27;s Death sacrifices herself and abolishes herself to make the poet immortal.
#Mirrors: we watch ourselves grow old in mirrors. They bring us closer to death.

The other themes are a mixture of Orphic and modern myth: for example, cars that talk (the radio receivers in cars).

&quot;Orphée&quot; is a realistic film; or, to be more precise, observing Goethe&#x27;s distinction between reality and truth, a film in which I express a truth peculiar to myself. If that truth is not the spectator&#x27;s, and if his personality conflicts with mine and rejects it, he accuses me of lying. I am even astonished that so many people can still be penetrated by another&#x27;s ideas, in a country noted for its individualism.

While &quot;Orphée&quot; does encounter some lifeless audiences, it also encounters others that are open to my dream and agree to be put to sleep and to dream it with me (accepting the logic by which dreams operate, which is implacable, although it is not governed by our logic).

I am only talking about the mechanics, since &quot;Orphée&quot; is not at all a dream in itself: through a wealth of detail similar to that which we find in dreams, it summarizes my way of living and my conception of life”.
==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews upon release. The Morandini Dictionary gives it a poor rating; calling it a “bizarre, artificial film, acted with execrable theatricality and terribly dated”. The Encyclopedia of International Film (&quot;Lexikon des Internationalen Films&quot;) writes: “In terms of content and form, Cocteau builds on the motifs from his first film (&quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;) and draws the viewer into an artfully crafted labyrinth of poetic symbols, mythological allusions and ironic jabs at the situation of the modern artist. The astonishing cinematographic tricks, some of which arose from the playful use of technology and coincidence, have retained their charm over the decades.” Reclam&#x27;s Film Guide states: “Cocteau plays with myths and images in a fascinating way. He creates a world of penumbra, of puzzles, in which mirrors become doors to the afterlife, and black-uniformed motorcyclists become messengers of death. The decidedly everyday, realistic images become a vehicle for mysterious allusions: Death has the same face as love, and the poet is Death&#x27;s favorite. The unreal invades reality -- death wanders the streets of Paris; and the afterlife, with its ritual of interrogations and negotiations, appears emphatically this-worldly. Cocteau achieved this state of suspension of reality using entirely cinematic means.”

The 1950 release of &quot;Orpheus&quot; in America influenced emerging gay poets, including Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Frank O&#x27;Hara and Allen Ginsberg. In 2000, critic Roger Ebert added &quot;Orpheus&quot; to his “Great Movies” list, praising the simple but ingenious special effects: “Seeing &quot;Orpheus&quot; today is like glimpsing a cinematic realm that has passed completely from the scene. Films are rarely made for purely artistic reasons, experiments are discouraged, and stars as big as Marais are not cast in eccentric remakes of Greek myths. The story in Cocteau&#x27;s hands becomes unexpectedly complex; we see that it is not simply about love, death and jealousy, but also about how art can seduce the artist away from ordinary human concerns”.

Andrei Tarkovsky considered it a masterpiece and named it one of the 77 greatest works of cinema. Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa also cited &quot;Orpheus&quot; as one of his 100 favorite films.

==Opera adaptation==
In 1993, Philip Glass adapted the film as a stage opera, &quot;Orphée&quot;, with a libretto by the composer taken directly from Cocteau&#x27;s screenplay. Jointly commissioned by the American Repertory Theater and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the work had its premiere on May 14, 1993, at the American Repertory Theater. Francesca Zambello directed the premiere, and the production, closely based on the imagery of the film, was by frequent Glass collaborator Robert Israel. Baritone Eugene Perry originated the role of Orphée, with Wendy Hill as the Princess, Richard Fracker as Heurtebise, and Elizabeth Futral as Eurydice.

In 2007, the opera was revived at Glimmerglass conducted by Anne Manson; Manson also conducted a recording with the Portland Opera in 2010.

<doc id="215740" wikidata="Q943121" url="?curid=215740" title="Bryan Caplan">
<text>Bryan Douglas Caplan (born April 8, 1971) is an American economist and author. He is a professor of economics at George Mason University, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, and a former contributor to the &quot;Freakonomics&quot; blog. He currently publishes his own blog, &quot;Bet on It&quot;. Caplan is a self-described &quot;economic libertarian&quot;. The bulk of Caplan&#x27;s academic work is in behavioral economics and public economics, especially public choice theory.

==Early life and education==
Caplan was born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, in Northridge, California, on April 8, 1971. He obtained a B.A. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1993 and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1997.

==Writing==
===&quot;The Myth of the Rational Voter&quot;===
&quot;The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies&quot;, published in 2007, further develops the &quot;rational irrationality&quot; concept from Caplan&#x27;s earlier academic writing. It draws heavily from the &quot;Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy&quot; in making the argument that voters have systematically biased beliefs about many important economic topics. Caplan writes that rational irrationality is an explanation for the failure of democracy. The book was reviewed in the popular press, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as well as in academic publications such as the &quot;Journal of Libertarian Studies&quot;, &quot;Public Choice&quot;, &quot;Libertarian Papers&quot;, and &quot;The Independent Review&quot;. It received a disparaging critique by Rupert Read in the &quot;European Review&quot;.

===&quot;Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids&quot;===
In 2011, Caplan published his second book, titled &quot;Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids&quot;, arguing that people often work too hard in child-rearing, and as a result, they are scared of the idea of having children. Caplan&#x27;s book urged parents to relax with respect to child-rearing. The book argues that as the perceived costs (in terms of child-rearing expense and effort) of having children fell, it made sense to have more children based on the basic theory of supply and demand. The book was reviewed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, RealClearMarkets, and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. It also led to debates sponsored by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; had Caplan debating &quot;Tiger Mom&quot; Amy Chua on the merits of strict parenting style. The book was also featured in a story on National Public Radio. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as &quot;inconsistent and unpersuasive.&quot;

===&quot;The Ideological Turing Test&quot;===
In a June 2011 blog post titled &quot;The Ideological Turing Test&quot; contesting Paul Krugman&#x27;s claim that political liberals can accurately state conservatives&#x27; views but not vice versa, Caplan proposed a test analogous to a kind of Turing test: instead of judging whether a chatbot had accurately imitated a person, the test would judge whether a person had accurately stated the views of ideological opponents to the opponents&#x27; satisfaction. Other writers have since said of someone that they can (or can&#x27;t) &quot;pass an ideological Turing test&quot; if they are deemed to be capable (or incapable) of understanding and accurately stating an adversary&#x27;s arguments.

===&quot;The Case Against Education&quot;===
&quot;The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money&quot; was published in 2018 by Princeton University Press. Drawing on the economic concept of job market signaling and research in educational psychology, the book argues that much of higher education is very inefficient and has only a small effect in improving human capital, contrary to much of the conventional consensus in labor economics that Caplan claims takes the human capital theory for granted.

===&quot;Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration&quot;===
Caplan and &quot;Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal&quot; cartoonist Zach Weinersmith created the graphic non-fiction book &quot;Open Borders: the Science and Ethics of Immigration&quot;, which was released on October 29, 2019.

Tyler Cowen called it &quot;a landmark in economic education, how to present economic ideas, and the integration of economic analysis and graphic visuals.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; praised it as &quot;a model of respectful, persuasive argument&quot;. Kevin D. Williamson, writing in &quot;National Review&quot;, concluded a review of the book with &quot;Professor Caplan&#x27;s argument is multifaceted, energetically presented, fun to read, and worth giving some real attention to if only as an exercise in clarifying one&#x27;s own thinking about the question&quot;. Williamson said that the book was &quot;fun to read&quot; and well-presented but that Caplan did not address some obvious counterarguments against open borders and suggested that he oversimplified the issue.

===&quot;Labor Econ Versus the World&quot;===
In 2022, Caplan published &quot;Labor Econ Versus the World: Essays on the World&#x27;s Greatest Market&quot;, a collection of his essays from the publication &quot;EconLog&quot; edited by Jack Pfefferkorn. In it, Caplan argues against minimum wage laws, immigration bans, government spending on education, and Keynesianism.

Tyler Cowen wrote a reaction to the book, stating that his disagreement with Caplan is &quot;that most of the inequity occurs upstream of labor markets, through the medium of culture.&quot;

==Views==
Caplan was cited as one of the leading proponents of the open borders position in articles in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot;. He has also been quoted on the topic of immigration in outlets such as the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Caplan&#x27;s anarcho-capitalist views were discussed by Brian Doherty in his book &quot;Radicals for Capitalism&quot; and in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine. Caplan has argued that anarcho-capitalists have a better claim on the history of anarchist thought than &quot;mainstream anarchists&quot;, or &quot;left-anarchists&quot;, as he refers to them. This argument has been disputed by other anarchists.

==Personal life==
Caplan is married to Corina Caplan, with four children, and resides in Oakton, Virginia.

<doc id="215741" wikidata="Q425951" url="?curid=215741" title="Capitalization">
<text>Capitalization (American spelling; also British spelling in Oxford) or capitalisation (Commonwealth English; all other meanings) is writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter (uppercase letter) and the remaining letters in lower case, in writing systems with a case distinction. The term also may refer to the choice of the casing applied to text.

Conventional writing systems (orthographies) for different languages have different conventions for capitalization, for example, the capitalization of titles. Conventions also vary, to a lesser extent, between different style guides. In addition to the Latin script, capitalization also affects the Armenian, Cyrillic, Georgian and Greek alphabets.

The full rules of capitalization in English are complicated. The rules have also changed over time, generally to capitalize fewer words. The conventions used in an 18th-century document will be unfamiliar to a modern reader; for instance, many common nouns were capitalized.

The systematic use of capitalized and uncapitalized words in running text is called &quot;mixed case&quot;.

==Parts of speech==
Owing to the essentially arbitrary nature of orthographic classification and the existence of variant authorities and local &quot;house styles&quot;, questionable capitalization of words is not uncommon, even in respected newspapers and magazines. Most publishers require &quot;consistency&quot;, at least within the same document, in applying a specified standard: this is described as &quot;house style&quot;.

===Pronouns===

* In English, the subjective form of the singular first-person pronoun, &quot;I&quot;, is capitalized, along with all its contractions such as &quot;I&#x27;ll&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;. Objective and possessive forms (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, and &quot;mine&quot;) are not.
* Many European languages traditionally capitalize nouns and pronouns used to refer to God, including references to Jesus Christ (reverential capitals): &quot;hallowed be Thy name&quot;, &quot;look what He has done&quot;. Some English authors capitalize any word referring to God: &quot;the Lamb&quot;, &quot;the Almighty&quot;; some capitalize &quot;Thy Name&quot;. These practices have become much less common in English in the 20th and 21st centuries.
** In Baháʼí literature, singular and plural object, subject, and possessive forms get capitalization if referring to a Rasul, the Twelve Imams, or &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Baha.
* Some languages capitalize a royal we (), e.g. it is capitalized in German.

====2nd-person pronouns====
Many languages distinguish between formal and informal 2nd-person pronouns.
* In German, the formal 2nd-person plural pronoun is capitalized along with all its case-forms (, , etc.), but these words are not capitalized when used as 3rd-person feminine singular or plural pronouns. Until the recent German spelling reform(s), the traditional rules (which are still widely adhered to, although not taught in schools) also capitalized the informal 2nd-person singular pronoun (and its derivatives, such as ) when used in letters or similar texts, but this is no longer required.
* Italian also capitalizes its formal pronouns, and , and their cases (even within words, e.g. &quot;goodbye&quot;, formal). This is occasionally also done for the Dutch , though this is formally only required when referring to a deity and may be considered archaic.
* In Spanish, the abbreviations of the pronouns and , , , , and , are usually written with a capital.
* In Finnish and Estonian, the second-person plural pronoun can be used when formally addressing a single person, and in writing the pronoun is sometimes capitalized as to indicate special regard. In a more familiar tone, one can also capitalize the second-person singular pronoun ( in Estonian).
* Similarly, in Russian the formal second-person pronoun , and its oblique cases , etc., are capitalized (usually in personal correspondence); also in Bulgarian.
* Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian capitalize the formal second-person pronoun along with its oblique cases (, , ) and personal pronoun ( etc.) in formal correspondence. Historically, the familiar second-person pronoun and its cases (, , ) were capitalized as well, but new orthography prohibits such use.
* In Danish, the plural second-person pronoun, , is capitalized, but its other forms and are not. This distinguishes it from the preposition (&quot;in&quot;). The less commonly used formal singular second-person pronoun is also capitalized in all its forms (, , ), distinguishing it from the otherwise identical third-person plural pronouns.
* In Norwegian, both second-person singular and plural have a capitalized alternative form (, , in Bokmål; , , in Nynorsk) to express formality for both subject and object of a sentence, but is very rarely used in modern speech and writing.
* In formally written Polish, Czech, Slovak and Latvian, most notably in letters and e-mails, all pronouns referring to the addressee are capitalized. This includes (&quot;thou&quot;) and all its related forms such as and . This principle extends to nouns used formally to address the addressee of a letter, such as (&quot;sir&quot;) and (&quot;madam&quot;).
* In Indonesian, capitalizing the formal second-person pronoun along with all references to the addressee, such as &quot;&quot; ((to) Sir/Madam), is required in practice of (Perfected Orthography). However, some people do not know of or choose not to adhere to this spelling rule. In contrast, Malay orthography used in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei does not require the capitalization of .
* In Tagalog and its standard form, Filipino, the formal second-person pronouns and and their oblique form are customarily and reverentially capitalized as such, particularly in most digital and printed media related to religion and its references. Purists who consider this rule as nonstandard and inconsistent do not apply it when writing.
* In Tajik, capitalization is used to distinguish the second-person formal pronoun &#x27; from the second-person plural pronoun &#x27;.
* In Swedish, since , the second-person singular pronoun may be capitalized as when addressed formally.

===Nouns===
* The various languages and dialects in the High German family, including Standard German and Luxembourgish, are the only major languages using the Latin alphabet in which all nouns are capitalized. This was also practiced in other Germanic languages (mainly due to German influence):
** In German and Luxembourgish, &quot;all&quot; nouns (and verbs being used as nouns) are capitalized.
** Danish, before the spelling reform of 1948
** Swedish, during the 17th and 18th centuries
** English, during the 17th and 18th centuries (as in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and most of the original 1787 United States Constitution)
** Some regional languages, such as Saterland Frisian
* In nearly all European languages, single-word proper nouns, including personal names, are capitalized (like &quot;France&quot; or &quot;Moses&quot;). Multiple-word proper nouns usually follow the traditional English rules for publication titles (as in &quot;Robert the Bruce&quot;).
** Where place names are merely preceded by the definite article, this is usually in lower case (as in &quot;the Philippines&quot;).
*** Sometimes, the article is integral to the name, and thus is capitalized (as in , ). However, in French this does not occur for contractions and (as in , &quot;I come from Le Havre&quot;). In other European languages, it is much more common for the article to be treated as integral to the name, but it may not be capitalized (, , , etc.).
** A few English names are written with two lowercase &quot;f&quot;s: &quot;ffrench&quot;, &quot;ffoulkes&quot;, etc. This originated as a variant script for capital F.
** A few individuals have chosen not to use capitals in their names, such as k.d. lang and bell hooks. E. E. Cummings, whose name is often written without capitals, did not do so himself: the usage derives from the typography used on the cover of one of his books. 
** Most brand names and trademarks are capitalized (e.g., Coca-Cola, Pepsi), although some have chosen to deviate from standard rules (e.g., easyJet, id Software, eBay, iPod) to be distinctive. When capitals occur within a word, it is sometimes referred to as camel case.
** Some speakers of Eastern Slavic languages associate capitalization with respect and decapitalize proper nouns to show disrespect.
* In English, the names of days of the week, months and languages are capitalized, as are demonyms like &quot;Englishman&quot;, &quot;Arab&quot;. In other languages, practice varies, but almost all languages other than German and Luxembourgish (which capitalize &quot;all&quot; nouns) do not.
* In English-language addresses, the noun following the proper name of a street is capitalized, whether or not it is abbreviated: &quot;Main Street&quot;, &quot;Fleming Ave.&quot;, &quot;Montgomery Blvd.&quot; This capitalization is often absent in older citations and in combined usages: &quot;Fourth and Main streets&quot;. In French, street names are capitalized when they are proper names; the noun itself (, ) is normally not capitalized: , .
* In Italian the name of a particular concept or object is capitalized when the writer wants to emphasize its importance and significance.
* Capitalization is always used for most names of taxa used in scientific classification of living things, except for species-level taxa or below. Example: &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;.
* Controversially, some authors capitalize common names of some animal and plant species. As a general rule, names are not capitalized, unless they are part of an official list of names, in which case they have become proper nouns and are capitalized. This is most common for birds and fishes. Names referring to more than one species (e.g., &quot;horse&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;) are always in lower case. Botanists generally do not capitalize the common names of plants, though individual words in plant names may be capitalized for another reason: (&quot;Italian stone pine&quot;). See the discussion of official common names under common name for an explanation.
* Common nouns may be capitalized when used as names for the entire class of such things, e.g. &quot;what a piece of work is Man&quot;. Other Romance languages such as French often capitalize such nouns as (the state) and (the church) when not referring to specific ones.
* Names by which gods are known are capitalized, including &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Athena&quot;, and &quot;Vishnu&quot;. The word &quot;god&quot; is generally not capitalized if it is used to refer to the generic idea of a deity, nor is it capitalized when it refers to multiple gods, e.g. &quot;Roman gods&quot;. There may be some confusion because Judaism, Christianity, and Islam rarely refer to the Deity by a specific name, but simply as &quot;God&quot; (see Writing divine names). Other names for the God of these three Abrahamic faiths, such as &quot;Elohim&quot;, &quot;Yahweh&quot;, and &quot;Lord&quot;, are also capitalized.
* While acronyms have historically been written in all-caps, British, Finnish, Swedish and some German usage has moved towards capitalizing only the first letter in cases when these are pronounced as words (e.g. Unesco and Nato), reserving all-caps for initialisms (e.g. UK, USA, UNHCR).
* In life stance orthography, in order to distinguish life stances from general -isms. For instance, Humanism is distinguished from humanism.
* In legal English, &quot;defined terms&quot; that refer to a specific entity, such as &quot;Tenant&quot; and &quot;Lessor&quot;, are often capitalized. More specifically, in legal documents, terms which are formally defined elsewhere in the document or a related document (often in a schedule of definitions) are capitalized to indicate that that is the case, and may be several words long, e.g. &quot;the Second Subsidiary Claimant&quot;, &quot;the Agreed Conditional Release Date&quot;.
** In contracts, particularly important clauses are often typeset as all-caps
* Most English honorifics and titles of persons, e.g. &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Dr Watson&quot;, &quot;Mrs Jones&quot;, &quot;His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh&quot;. This does not apply where the words are not titles; e.g. &quot;Watson is a doctor, Philip is a duke.&quot;
*In very formal British English the King is referred to as The King.
* The governing body of English solicitors is correctly referred to as The Law Society. (In general any organisation may choose a name starting with a capitalized &quot;The&quot;.)

===Adjectives===
* In English, adjectives derived from proper nouns (except the names of characters in fictional works) usually retain their capitalization: e.g. a &quot;Christian&quot; church, &quot;Canadian&quot; whisky, a &quot;Shakespearean&quot; sonnet, but not a &quot;quixotic&quot; mission nor &quot;malapropism&quot;. Where the original capital is no longer at the beginning of the word, usage varies: &quot;anti-Christian&quot;, and either &quot;Presocratic&quot;, &quot;pre-Socratic&quot;, &quot;Pre-Socratic&quot; or &quot;presocratic&quot;. Never &quot;preSocratic&quot;a hyphen must precede a capital in a compound word.
* Such adjectives do not receive capitals in French (, ), Spanish (, ), Swedish (, ), Polish (, ) nor partly in German (, , but (&quot;Ohm&#x27;s Law&quot;)). In German, if the adjective becomes a noun by using an article or numeral in front of it ( (the colorful thing(s)), (a beautiful one)), it is capitalized like any other noun, as are nouns formed from proper nouns (). The same applies to verbs ( (the (practice of) running), (the (practice of) going for a walk)).
* Adjectives referring to nationality or ethnicity are not capitalized in many European languages such as German, French or Czech, even though nouns are: , , , a Canadian ship; , , , a Canadian. Both nouns and adjectives are capitalized in English when referring to nationality or ethnicity.

==Places and geographic terms==

The capitalization of geographic terms in English text generally depends on whether the author perceives the term as a proper noun, in which case it is capitalized, or as a combination of an established proper noun with a normal adjective or noun, in which case the latter are not capitalized. There are no universally agreed lists of English geographic terms which are considered as proper nouns. The following are &quot;examples&quot; of rules that some British and U.S. publishers have established in style guides for their authors:
* In general, the first letter is capitalized for well-defined regions, e.g. South America, Lower California, Tennessee Valley
* This general rule also applies to zones of the Earth&#x27;s surface (North Temperate Zone, the Equator)
* In other cases, do not capitalize the points of the compass (north China, southeast London) or other adjectives (western Arizona, central New Mexico, upper Yangtze, lower Rio Grande)
* Capitalize generic geographic terms that are part of a place name (Atlantic Ocean, Mt. Muztagata, River Severn)
* Otherwise, do not capitalize a generic term that follows a capitalized generic term (Yangtze River valley)
* Use lower case for plurals of generic terms (Gobi and Taklamakan deserts); but &quot;the Dakotas&quot;
* Only capitalize &quot;the&quot; if it is part of the (short-form) formal place name (The Hague vs. the Netherlands, the Sudan, and the Philippines)

Upper case: East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, North Korea, South Africa, the European Union, the Republic of Poland, the North Atlantic, the Middle East, the Arctic, The Gambia, The Bahamas, The Hague

Lower case: western China, southern Beijing, western Mongolia, eastern Africa, northern North Korea, the central Gobi, the lower Yangtze River.

Abbreviated

When a term is used as a name and then subsequently a shorter term is used, then that shorter term may be used generically. If that is the case do not capitalize. (&quot;The Tatra National Park is a tourist destination in Poland. Watch out for bears when visiting the national park.&quot;)

==By context==
* In all modern European languages, the first word in a sentence is capitalized, as is the first word in any quoted sentence. (For example, in English: Nana said, &quot;There are ripe watermelons in the garden!&quot;)
** The first word of a sentence is not capitalized in most modern editions of ancient Greek and, to a lesser extent, Latin texts. The distinction between lower and upper case was not introduced before the Middle Ages; in antiquity only the capital forms of letters were used.
** For some items, many style guides recommend that initial capitalization be avoided by not putting the item at the beginning of a sentence, or by writing it in lowercase even at the beginning of a sentence. Such scientific terms have their own rules about capitalization which take precedence over the standard initial capitalization rule. For example, &quot;pH&quot; would be liable to cause confusion if written &quot;PH&quot;, and initial &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot; may even have different meanings, milli and mega, for example 2 MA (megamperes) is a billion times 2 mA (milliamperes). Increasingly nowadays, some trademarks and company names start with a lowercase letter, and similar considerations apply.
** When the first letters of a word have been omitted and replaced by an apostrophe, the first letter in a sentence is usually left uncapitalized in English and certain other languages, as &quot;&#x27;tis a shame ...&quot; In Dutch, the second word is capitalized instead in this situation: &quot;&quot;&#x27;t Was leuk&quot; vs. &quot;Het was leuk&quot;&quot; (both meaning &quot;It was fun&quot;).
* Traditionally, the first words of a line of verse are capitalized in English, e.g.:&quot;Meanwhile, the winged Heralds, by commandOf sovereign power, with awful ceremonyAnd trumpet&#x27;s sound, throughout the host proclaimA solemn council forthwith to be heldAt Pandemonium, the high capitalOf Satan and his peers. [...]&quot; (Milton, Paradise Lost I:752–756)
** Modernist poets often ignore or defy this convention.
* In the U.S., headlines and titles of works typically use title case, in which certain words (such as nouns, adjectives and verbs) are capitalized and others (such as prepositions and conjunctions) are not. In the U.K., titles of works use title case, but headlines generally use sentence case (or all caps in tabloid newspapers).

==Names of capitalization styles==
The following names are given to systems of capitalization:

===Sentence case===
&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot; The standard case used in English prose. Generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography mentioned above; that is, only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns and other words which are generally capitalized by a more specific rule.

A variation is mid-sentence case which is identical to sentence case except that the first word is not capitalized (unless it would be capitalized by another rule). This type of letter case is used for entries in dictionaries.

=== Title case ===

&quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog.&quot;Also known as headline case and capital case. All words capitalized, except for certain subsets defined by rules that are not universally standardized, often minor words such as &quot;the&quot; (as above), &quot;of&quot;, or &quot;and&quot;. Other commonly lowercase words are prepositions and coordinating conjunctions. The standardization is only at the level of house styles and individual style manuals. (See Headings and publication titles.) A simplified variant is start case, where all words, including articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, start with a capital letter.

===All caps===

Also written as all-caps. Capital letters only. This style can be used for headlines and book or chapter titles at the top of a book page. It is commonly used in transcribed speech to indicate that a person is shouting, or to indicate a hectoring and obnoxious speaker. For this reason, it is generally discouraged. Long spans of Latin-alphabet text in all uppercase are harder to read because of the absence of the ascenders and descenders found in lowercase letters, which can aid recognition. In professional documents, a commonly preferred alternative to all caps text is the use of small caps to emphasize key names or acronyms, or the use of italics or (more rarely) bold. In addition, if all caps must be used, it is customary in headings of a few words to slightly widen the spacing between the letters, by around 10% of the point height. This practice is known as tracking or letterspacing.

==Special cases==
===Compound names===
Compound names are nouns that are made up of more than one stem, or a stem and one or more affixes.
Names that are made up of several affixes and one or more nouns are &quot;not&quot; compound names under this definition, but noun phrases, that are made up of one or more , and one or more nouns. Examples of the separable affixes may be found in List of family name affixes. Noun phrases are in this context treated as if they were nouns. So the general rule that nouns-as-names are capitalized in principle applies to compound names and noun-phrases-as-names as well. There are, however, &quot;exceptions&quot; to this rule that differ by language community.
* In German, the separable affix, and at the same time preposition, (meaning &quot;of&quot;, pronounced ) or (meaning &quot;named&quot;) in a surname (e.g. ) is not capitalized (unless it is the first letter of a sentence). &quot;Von&quot; is however often dropped within a sentence. The same applies to similar Italian and Portuguese affixes.
* In Dutch, the &quot;first&quot; affix, like ; or , or declensions of &quot;de&quot;; or contractions of a preposition and an article, like &quot;ter&quot;; in a surname are capitalized unless a given name, initial, or other family name. precedes it Other affixes in the noun phrase (if present) are left lowercase. However, in Belgium the capitalization of a surname follows the orthography as used for the person&#x27;s name in the Belgian population register and on his or her identification card., except when introducing a title of nobility or when use of the lower case has been granted to some noble family. An exception for the rule that a Dutch name starts with an uppercase letter under all circumstances (including at the start of a sentence) is included in the general capitalization rule: &quot;If the sentence begins with an apostrophe, the following full word is capitalized.&quot; This also applies to Dutch names that begin with a contraction that consists of an apostrophe and a letter.
* In English, practice varies when the name starts with a particle with a meaning such as &quot;from&quot; or &quot;the&quot; or &quot;son of&quot;.
**Some of these particles (&quot;Mac&quot;, &quot;Mc&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;O&quot;) are always capitalized; others (, ) are usually capitalized; still others often are not (, , , ). The compound particle is usually written with the &quot;L&quot; capitalized but not the &quot;d&quot;.
** The remaining part of such a name, following the particle, is always capitalized if it is set off with a space as a separate word, or if the particle was not capitalized. It is normally capitalized if the particle is &quot;Mc&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, or &quot;O&quot;. In other cases (including &quot;Mac&quot;), there is no set rule (both &quot;Macintyre&quot; and &quot;MacIntyre&quot; are seen, for example).
* Americans with non-Anglophone surnames often have not followed the orthographic conventions usual in the language communities of their extraction (or the US immigration authorities flouted the orthographic rules for them when they arrived at ports of entry like Ellis Island). As there are no universally accepted capitalization rules in these circumstances to serve as a guideline the best policy would seem to be to use the style that dominates for that person in reliable sources; for a , prefer the spelling consistently .

===Titles===
The Chicago Manual of Style recommends that the titles of English-language artistic works (plays, novels, essays, paintings, etc.) capitalize the first word and the last word in the title. Additionally, most other words within a title are capitalized as well; articles and coordinating conjunctions are not capitalized. Sources disagree on the details of capitalizing prepositions. For example, the Chicago Manual of Style recommends rendering all prepositions in lowercase, whereas the APA style guide instructs: &quot;Capitalize major words in titles of books and articles within the body of the paper. Conjunctions, articles, and short prepositions are not considered major words; however, capitalize all words of four letters or more.&quot;

In other languages, such as the Romance languages, only the first word and proper names are capitalized.

===Acronyms===
Acronyms are usually capitalized, with a few exceptions:
* Acronyms which have become regular words such as laser and scuba.
* Some acronyms of proper nouns in which function words are not capitalized, such as TfL (Transport for London) and LotR (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;).

===&quot;O&quot;===
* The English vocative particle &quot;O&quot;, an archaic form of address, e.g. &quot;Thou, O king, art a king of kings&quot;. However, lowercase &quot;o&quot; is also occasionally seen in this context.

===Accents===
In most languages that use diacritics, these are treated the same way in uppercase whether the text is capitalized or all-uppercase. They may be always preserved (as in German) or always omitted (as in Greek) or often omitted (as in French). Some attribute this to the fact that diacritics on capital letters were not available earlier on typewriters, and it is now becoming more common to preserve them in French and Spanish (in both languages the rule is to preserve them, although in France and Mexico, for instance, schoolchildren are often erroneously taught that they should not add diacritics on capital letters).

However, in the polytonic orthography used for Greek prior to 1982, accents were omitted in all-uppercase words, but kept as part of an uppercase initial (written before rather than above the letter). The latter situation is provided for by title-case characters in Unicode. When Greek is written with the present day monotonic orthography, where only the acute accent is used, the same rule is applied. The accent is omitted in all-uppercase words but it is kept as part of an uppercase initial (written before the letter rather than above it). The (diaeresis) should also always be used in all-uppercase words (even in cases where they are not needed when writing in lowercase, e.g. ).

===Digraphs and ligatures===
Some languages treat certain digraphs as single letters for the purpose of collation. In general, where one such is formed as a ligature, the corresponding uppercase form is used in capitalization; where it is written as two separate characters, only the first will be capitalized. Thus &quot;Oedipus&quot; or &quot;Œdipus&quot; are both correct, but &quot;OEdipus&quot; is not. Examples with ligature include in Danish, where &quot;Æ/æ&quot; is a completely separate letter rather than merely a typographic ligature (the same applies in Icelandic); examples with separate characters are in Welsh, where &quot;Ll&quot; is a single letter; and in Welsh where &quot;Ff&quot; is equivalent to English &quot;F&quot; (whereas Welsh &quot;F&quot; corresponds to English &quot;V&quot;). Presentation forms, however, can use doubled capitals, such as the logo of the National Library of Wales (). The position in Hungarian is similar to the latter.
* An exception is the Dutch digraph &quot;IJ&quot;. Both letters are capitalized even though they are printed separately when using a computer, as in . In the past the digraph was written as &quot;Y&quot;, and this still survives in some surnames.
* A converse exception exists in the Croatian alphabet, where digraph letters (Dž, Lj, Nj) have mixed-case forms even when written as ligatures. With typewriters and computers, these &quot;title-case&quot; forms have become less common than 2-character equivalents; nevertheless they can be represented as single title-case characters in Unicode (ǅ, ǈ, ǋ).
* In Czech the digraph ch (usually considered as a single letter) can be capitalized in two ways: Ch or CH. In general only the first part is capitalized (Ch), unless the whole text is written in capital letters (then it is written CH). In acronyms both parts are usually capitalized, such as VŠCHT for &quot;Vysoká škola chemicko-technologická&quot; (University of Chemistry and Technology). However, the practice is not unified when writing initial letters of personal names (first name and surname), for example &quot;Jan Chudoba&quot; can be abbreviated both &quot;J. Ch.&quot; or &quot;J. CH.&quot;

===Initial mutation===
In languages where inflected forms of a word may have extra letters at the start, the capitalized letter may be the initial of the root form rather than the inflected form. For example, in Irish, in the placename , &quot;(the) mountain of the women&quot; (anglicized as Slievenamon), the word-form written contains the genitive plural of the noun , &quot;woman&quot;, mutated after the genitive plural definite article (i.e., &quot;of the&quot;). The written B is mute in this form.

Other languages may capitalize the initial letter of the orthographic word, even if it is not present in the base, as with definite nouns in Maltese that start with certain consonant clusters. For example, (the United States) capitalize the epenthetic , even though the base form of the word — without the definite article — is .

===Case-sensitive English words===
In English, there are a few capitonyms, which are words whose meaning (and sometimes pronunciation) varies with capitalization. For example, the month &quot;August&quot; versus the adjective &quot;august&quot;. Or the verb &quot;polish&quot; versus the adjective &quot;Polish&quot;.

<text>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov.
CMS was previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) until 2001.

CMS actively inspects and reports on every nursing home in the United States. This includes maintaining the 5-Star Quality Rating System.

==History==
Originally, the name &quot;Medicare&quot; in the United States referred to a program providing medical care for families of people serving in the military as part of the Dependents&#x27; Medical Care Act, which was passed in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower held the first White House Conference on Aging in January 1961, in which creating a health care program for social security beneficiaries was proposed.

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments on July 30, 1965, establishing both Medicare and Medicaid. Arthur E. Hess, a deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, was named as first director of the Bureau of Health Insurance in 1965, placing him as the first executive in charge of the Medicare program. At the time, the program provided health insurance to 19 million Americans. The Social Security Administration (SSA) became responsible for the administration of Medicare and the Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS) became responsible for the administration of Medicaid. Both agencies were organized under what was then known as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), in 1965. Since then, HEW, has been reorganized as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1980. This consequently brought Medicare and Medicaid under the jurisdiction of the HHS. 

In March 1977, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was established under HEW. HCFA became responsible for the coordination of Medicare and Medicaid. The responsibility for enrolling beneficiaries into Medicare and processing premium payments remained with SSA.

HCFA was renamed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on July 1, 2001.

In 2013, a report by the inspector general found that CMS had paid $23 million in benefits to deceased beneficiaries in 2011.

In April 2014, CMS released raw claims data from 2012 that gave a look into what types of doctors billed Medicare the most.

In January 2018, CMS released guidelines for states to use to require Medicaid beneficiaries to continue receiving coverage. These guidelines came in response to then-President Trump&#x27;s announcement that he would allow states to impose work requirements in Medicaid. In October, CMS reported a data breach of 75,000 people&#x27;s personal data due to a hack.

In February 2018, CMS removed a notice from its website that informed insurance companies they were not allowed to charge physicians a fee when the companies paid the doctors for their work. This has resulted in doctors being charged up to a 5% fee on their compensation, adding up to billions of dollars annually.

In January 2021, CMS passed a rule that would cover &quot;breakthrough technology&quot; for four years after they received FDA approval. In September 2021, CMS submitted a proposal to repeal the rule based on safety concerns.

On September 19, 2023, the Subcommittee on Health held a hearing titled &quot;Examining Policies to Improve Seniors’ Access to Innovative Drugs, Medical Devices, and Technology.&quot; Dora Hughes, the acting director of the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), defended the proposed Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies (TCET) pathway, which aims to restrict coverage for breakthrough medical devices to five reviews a year. Some lawmakers and medtech trade groups called for expanding the pathway to include diagnostics. Various other legislative proposals were discussed during the hearing, including bills related to Medicare coverage, drug pricing, and transparency in healthcare.

==Workforce==
CMS employs over 6,000 people, of whom about 4,000 are located at its headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland. The remaining employees are located in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington, D.C., the 10 regional offices listed below, and in various field offices located throughout the United States.

The head of CMS is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. The position is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. On May 27, 2021, Chiquita Brooks-LaSure was sworn in as administrator, the first black woman to serve in the role.

<doc id="215747" wikidata="Q301980" url="?curid=215747" title="Corpus delicti">
<text>(Latin for &quot;body of the crime&quot;; plural: ), in Western law, is the principle that a crime must be proven to have occurred before a person could be convicted of having committed that crime.

For example, a person cannot be tried for larceny unless it can be proven that property has been stolen. Likewise in order for a person to be tried for arson, it must be proven that a criminal act resulted in the burning of a property. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; (6th ed.) defines &quot;&quot;corpus delicti&quot; as: &quot;the fact of a crime having been actually committed&quot;.

In common law systems, the concept has its outgrowth in several principles. Many jurisdictions hold as a legal rule that a defendant&#x27;s out-of-court confession alone, is insufficient evidence to prove the defendant&#x27;s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. A corollary to this rule is that an accused cannot be convicted solely upon the testimony of an accomplice. Some jurisdictions also hold that without first showing independent corroboration that a crime has occurred, the prosecution may not introduce evidence of the defendant&#x27;s statement.

==Requirements==
In general, all &quot;corpus delicti&quot; requires at a minimum:

# The occurrence of the specific injury; and
# some criminal act as the source of the injury.

For example:

* Homicide: 1) An individual has died 2) as a result of action (or inaction) by another person.
* Larceny: 1) Property is missing 2) because it was stolen.

In essence &quot;corpus delicti&quot; of crimes refers to evidence that a violation of law occurred; no literal &#x27;body&#x27; is needed.

==Murder cases==
When a person disappears and cannot be contacted, many police agencies initiate a missing person case. If, during the course of the investigation, detectives believe that they have been murdered, then a &quot;body&quot; of evidentiary items, including physical, demonstrative and testimonial evidence, must be obtained to establish that the missing person has indeed died, and that their death was by homicide, before a suspect can be charged with murder. The clearest evidence in these cases is the physical body of the deceased. However, in the event that a body is not present or has not yet been discovered, it is possible to prove a crime took place if sufficient circumstantial evidence is presented to prove the matter beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, the presence at a missing person&#x27;s home of spilled human blood, identifiable as that person&#x27;s, in sufficient quantity to indicate exsanguination, demonstrates—even in the absence of a corpse—that the possibility that no crime has occurred, and the missing person is merely missing, is not reasonably credible.

==Misinterpretation==
The British serial killer John George Haigh destroyed the bodies of his victims with acid apparently because he thought that, in the absence of a corpse, murder could not be proven because there was no &quot;corpus delicti&quot;. Haigh had misinterpreted the Latin word &quot;corpus&quot; as a literal body rather than a figurative one. This had previously been the case, under Matthew Hale&#x27;s Rule of &quot;no body, no crime&quot;, but in the twentieth century, the law expanded to allow prosecution for murder solely on circumstantial evidence.

The sovereign citizen movement often uses this term during routine traffic stops. Sovereign citizens believe that traffic infractions are not crimes, and thus cannot be proven in a court of law.

<text>Steadicam is a brand of camera stabilizer mounts for motion picture cameras invented by Garrett Brown and introduced in 1975 by Cinema Products Corporation. The Steadicam brand was acquired by Tiffen in 2000. It was designed to isolate the camera from the camera operator&#x27;s movement, keeping the camera motion separate and controllable by a skilled operator.

== History ==
Before the camera stabilizing system, a director had a number of choices for moving (or &quot;tracking&quot;) shots:
# The camera could be mounted on a dolly, a wheeled mount that rolls on specialized tracks or a smooth surface.
# The camera could be mounted on a crane, a counterweighted arm that could move the camera vertically and horizontally.
# The camera operator shot hand-held which would produce footage suitable mostly for reportage used in documentaries, news, or live action; for unrehearsed or practice footage; or for the evocation of authentic immediacy—e.g. &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; style—during dramatic sequences.

While these cinematic techniques are still common, smooth and steady tracking shots with lighter weight camera systems was enabled with the creation of the Steadicam in 1975 by inventor and cameraman Garrett Brown. After completing the first working prototype, which was called the &quot;Brown Stabilizer&quot;, Brown created a ten-minute demo reel of the new cinematography techniques enabled by the Steadicam and which was shown to numerous directors, including Stanley Kubrick and John G. Avildsen. The Steadicam was subsequently licensed to and manufactured by Cinema Products Corporation, which later diversified the brand into a consumer line of Steadicams for light weight DV cameras.

The Steadicam was first used in the Best Picture–nominated Woody Guthrie biopic &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976). Cinematographer Haskell Wexler had Brown begin a shot on a fully elevated platform crane which jibbed down, and when it reached the ground, Brown stepped off and walked the camera through the set.

Steadicams were then used extensively for chase scenes on the streets of New York City in &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976), which was released two months before &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. The Steadicam&#x27;s third picture was Avildsen&#x27;s Best Picture–winning &quot;Rocky&quot; in 1976, where it was an integral part of the film&#x27;s Philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the Art Museum&#x27;s flight of stairs. In many fight scenes a Steadicam was visible ringside, as well as during some wide shots of the final fight. &quot;Rocky&quot; was also released before &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. Garrett Brown was the Steadicam operator on all three films.

&quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) prompted further Steadicam innovation when director Stanley Kubrick requested that the camera shoot from barely above the floor. This necessitated the invention of &quot;low mode&quot;, in which the top of the camera is mounted to the bottom of an inverted post, which substantially increased the creative angles of the system which previously could not go much lower than the operator&#x27;s waist height.

A Steadicam rig was also employed during the filming of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the speeder bike chase. Brown walked through a redwood forest, with the camera running at a speed of less than one frame per second. The result, when projected at 24 frames per second, gave the impression of flying through the air at perilous speeds. In the Michael Crichton film &quot;Runaway&quot; (1984), a Steadicam rig was used to simulate the point of view of a futuristic smart bullet in flight while targeting specific individuals by their heat signature.

== Description ==

The Steadicam system includes a harness, known as the Steadicam vest, which the operator wears. This vest is connected to an iso-elastic arm, which in turn is linked to a multi-axis, ultra-low friction gimbal. Attached to the gimbal is the Steadicam &quot;sled,&quot; which supports the camera at one end and counterbalancing weights—typically a monitor and batteries—at the other. The monitor serves as a substitute for the camera&#x27;s viewfinder, which becomes unusable due to the camera&#x27;s range of motion relative to the operator. The design ensures that the Steadicam remains upright by maintaining the bottom slightly heavier than the top, pivoting around the gimbal. This configuration allows the operator to control the center of gravity of the rig, regardless of its weight, through precise movements of the gimbal. The operator&#x27;s skill lies in maintaining the desired framing and composition by delicately adjusting the gimbal&#x27;s position, whether in motion or stationary.

The combined weight of the counterbalance and camera means that the armature bears a relatively high inertial mass which is not easily moved by small body movements from the operator. The freely pivoting armature adds additional stabilization to the photographed image, and makes the weight of the camera-sled assembly acceptable by allowing the body harness to support it.

When the armature is correctly balanced, operators can remove their hands from the Steadicam entirely and the camera stays in place. During operation, the Steadicam operator usually rests a hand on the camera gimbal and applies force at that point to move the camera. To avoid shaking the camera when lens adjustments are made, a wireless remote operated by the camera assistant is used to control focus and iris.

For low-angle shots, the Steadicam sled can be inverted vertically, putting the camera on the bottom, and the monitor and batteries on the top. This is referred to as &quot;low mode&quot; operation.

The newest generation is the Tango. A body-supported camera-stabilization-system, its horizontal mechanism makes it possible to move the camera freely while staying horizontal. A Steadicam operator can change from low mode to high mode without any alteration. Dimensions are not limited to ups and downs, but also in depth and over or through obstacles.

The smallest, lightest Steadicam that can be used with a support arm and vest is the Merlin. Photographers who shoot with HDSLR cameras that combine still and motion photography most often work with the Merlin. Since the Merlin has no facility to carry a separate monitor, cameras suitable for it must have built-in monitors.

Steadicam introduced a camera mount for smartphones, called the Smoothee, in 2012. Marketed to consumers instead of video professionals, its tubular frame supports iPhone and Android phones that are 4.53&quot; to 6.26&quot; long by 2.32&quot; to 3.27&quot; wide (115 to 159 mm long by 59 to 83 mm wide). An adapter can be used to fit a GoPro camera to it.

<doc id="215751" wikidata="Q685787" url="?curid=215751" title="Henry Hazlitt">
<text>Henry Stuart Hazlitt (; November 28, 1894 – July 9, 1993) was an American journalist, economist, and philosopher known for his advocacy of free markets and classical liberal principles. Over a career spanning more than seven decades, Hazlitt wrote extensively on business, economics, and public policy for prominent publications, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He is best known for his 1946 book, &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot;, a work grounded in the Austrian school of economics and the importance of individual liberty in economic decision-making.

Hazlitt was a strong proponent of sound monetary policy and a vocal critic of inflationary practices and government intervention in markets. As a defender of free enterprise, he drew on the ideas of economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, helping popularize their theories for a general audience. Beyond economics, Hazlitt contributed to debates on philosophy and ethics, advocating for the moral underpinnings of a free society. He also served as an editorial board member of the libertarian journal &quot;The Freeman&quot; and was a founding member of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE), one of the oldest free-market think tanks in the United States.

Throughout his life, Hazlitt&#x27;s writing and commentary significantly influenced public understanding of economic policy, and his works continue to inspire advocates of liberty and limited government around the world.

== Early life and education ==
Henry Hazlitt was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He was a collateral descendant of the British essayist William Hazlitt, but grew up in relative poverty, his father having died when Hazlitt was an infant. His early heroes were Herbert Spencer and William James, and his first ambition was for an academic career in psychology and philosophy. He attended New York&#x27;s City College, but left after only a short time to support his twice-widowed mother.

As he later wrote, his short time at college &quot;had a greater influence than may at first sight be supposed, not as much from the knowledge gained there, as from the increased consciousness of the knowledge which I still had to gain and the consequent ambition to attain it.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Early accomplishments ===
Hazlitt started his career at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as secretary to the managing editor when he was still a teenager, and his interest in the field of economics began while working there. His studies led him to &quot;The Common Sense of Political Economy&quot; by Philip Wicksteed which, he later said, was his first &quot;tremendous influence&quot; in the subject. Hazlitt published his first book, &quot;Thinking as a Science&quot; at age 21. He wrote the book because he realized—through his intense process of self-education—that it was more important to think clearly than to merely absorb information. As he explains in its opening pages:

=== Military service ===
During World War I, he served in the Army Air Service. While residing in Brooklyn, he enlisted in New York City on February 11, 1918, and served with the Aviation Section of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps until July 9, 1918. He was then in Princeton, New Jersey, at the US School of Military Aeronautics until October 22, when he was sent to AS Camp Dick in Dallas, Texas, for a few weeks until November 7, and he was honorably discharged from service with the rank of private first class on December 12, 1918. He returned to New York, residing at Washington Square Park for many years.

=== Editor and author ===
In the early 1920s, he was financial editor of &quot; The New York Evening Mail&quot;, and during this period, Hazlitt reported his understanding of economics was further refined by frequent discussions with former Harvard economics professor Benjamin Anderson, who was then working for Chase National Bank in Manhattan. Later, when the publisher W. W. Norton suggested he write an official biography of their author Bertrand Russell, Hazlitt spent &quot;a good deal of time,&quot; as he described it, with the famous philosopher. Lord Russell &quot;so admired the young journalist&#x27;s talent&quot; that he had agreed with Norton&#x27;s proposal, but the project ended after nearly two years of work when Russell declared his intention to write it on his own as an autobiography instead.

During the interwar decades, a vibrant period in the history of American literature, Hazlitt served as literary editor of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; (1925–1929), and as literary editor of the left-leaning journal, &quot;The Nation&quot; (1930–1933). In connection with his work for &quot;The Nation&quot;, Hazlitt also edited &quot;A Practical Program for America&quot; (1932), a compilation of Great Depression policy considerations. After a series of public debates with socialist Louis Fischer, Hazlitt and &quot;The Nation&quot; parted ways.

In 1933, Hazlitt published &quot;The Anatomy of Criticism&quot;, an extended &quot;trialogue&quot; examining the nature of literary criticism and appreciation, regarded by some to be an early refutation of literary deconstruction. In the same year, he became H. L. Mencken&#x27;s chosen successor as editor of the literary magazine, &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, which Mencken had founded with George Jean Nathan, as a result of which appointment &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; included Hazlitt among those hailed in its regular &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; photo feature. Due to increasing differences with the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf Sr., he served in that role for only a brief time, but Mencken wrote that Hazlitt was the &quot;only competent critic of the arts that I have heard of who was at the same time a competent economist, of practical as well as theoretical training,&quot; adding that he &quot;is one of the few economists in human history who could really write.&quot;

From 1934 to 1946, Hazlitt was the principal editorial writer on finance and economics for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing both a signed weekly column and most of the unsigned editorials on economics, producing a considerable volume of work. Following World War II, he came into conflict with Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, over the newly established Bretton Woods system which created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Hazlitt opposed the Bretton Woods agreement, primarily fearing the risk of inflation. After agreeing not to write on the topic, he looked for another venue for his work, deciding on &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, for which he wrote a signed column, &quot;Business Tides&quot;, from 1946 to 1966.

According to Hazlitt, the greatest influence on his writing in economics was the work of Ludwig von Mises, and he is credited with introducing the ideas of the Austrian School of economics to the English-speaking layman. In 1938, for example, he reviewed the recently published English translation of Mises&#x27;s influential treatise &quot;Socialism&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, declaring it &quot;a classic&quot; and &quot;the most devastating analysis of socialism yet penned.&quot; After the Jewish economist&#x27;s emigration to the United States from National Socialist-dominated Europe in 1940, Hazlitt arranged for Mises to contribute editorials to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and helped to secure for Mises a teaching position at New York University. Along with the efforts of his friends, Max Eastman and John Chamberlain, Hazlitt also helped introduce F. A. Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; to the American reading public. His 1944 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; caused &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, where Eastman served as roving editor, to publish one of its trademark condensations, bringing the future Nobel laureate&#x27;s work to a vast audience.

Author Tom Malone contends that Hazlitt distinguished himself from other economists largely by his skill as a writer:Unlike many other writers of his generation from the political right, Hazlitt never experienced a period when he was a socialist or communist, or a significant change in his classical liberal political views. He was the founding vice president of the Foundation for Economic Education, which also acquired his large personal library in the 1980s. Established by Leonard Read in 1946, FEE is considered to be the first &quot;think tank&quot; for free-market ideas. He was also one of the original members of the classical liberal Mont Pelerin Society in 1947.

With John Chamberlain (and Suzanne La Follette as managing editor), Hazlitt served as editor of the early free market publication &quot;The Freeman&quot; from 1950 to 1952, and as sole editor-in-chief from 1952 to 1953, and its contributors during his tenure there included Hayek, Mises, and Wilhelm Röpke, as well as the writers James Burnham, John Dos Passos, Max Eastman, John T. Flynn, Frank Meyer, Raymond Moley, Morrie Ryskind, and George Sokolsky. Prior to his becoming editor, &quot;The Freeman&quot; had supported Senator Joseph McCarthy in his conflict with President Harry Truman on the issue of communism, &quot;undiscriminatingly&quot; according to some critics, but upon becoming editor, Hazlitt changed the magazine&#x27;s policy to one of support for President Truman.

&quot;The Freeman&quot; is widely considered to be an important forerunner to the conservative &quot;National Review&quot;, founded by William F. Buckley, Jr., which from the start included many of the same contributing editors. Hazlitt himself was on the masthead of &quot;National Review&quot;, either as a contributing editor or, later, as contributor, from its inception in 1955 until his death in 1993. Differences existed between the journals: &quot;The Freeman&quot; under Hazlitt was more secular and presented a wider range of foreign policy opinion than the later &quot;National Review&quot;.

Even prior to her success with &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, the novelist Ayn Rand was a friend of both Hazlitt and his wife, Frances, and Hazlitt introduced Rand to Mises, bringing together the two figures who would become most associated with the defense of pure &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism. The two became admirers of Hazlitt and of one another.

Hazlitt became well known both through his articles and by frequently debating prominent politicians on the radio, including: Vice President Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of State Dean Acheson, and U.S. Senators Paul Douglas and Hubert H. Humphrey, the future Vice President. In the early 1950s, he also occasionally appeared on the CBS Television current events program &quot;Longines Chronoscope&quot;, interviewing figures such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., along with coeditor William Bradford Huie. At the invitation of philosopher Sidney Hook, he was also a participating member of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom in the 1950s.

When he finally left &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1966, the magazine replaced Hazlitt with three university professors: &quot;free-market monetarist Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, middle-of-the-roader Henry Wallich of Yale, and Keynesian Paul A. Samuelson of MIT.&quot; His last published scholarly article appeared in the first volume of &quot;The Review of Austrian Economics&quot; (now, &quot;The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics&quot;) in 1987.

He was awarded an honorary doctoral degree at Universidad Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala.

== Economics and philosophy ==
About Hazlitt, Lew Rockwell wrote: &quot;The times call for courage. The times call for hard work. But if the demands are high, it is because the stakes are even higher. They are nothing less than the future of liberty, which means the future of civilization.&quot; Rockwell called &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;most enduring contribution.&quot; With a million copies sold and available in ten languages, it is considered a classic by several American conservative, free-market, and right-libertarian circles, such as at the Mises Institute. Ayn Rand called it a &quot;magnificent job of theoretical exposition&quot;, while Congressman Ron Paul ranks it with the works of Frédéric Bastiat and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek himself praised the work, saying that &quot;Henry Hazlitt&#x27;s explanation of how a price system works is a true classic: timeless, correct, painlessly instructive.&quot; Nobel Prize laureate Milton Friedman described it as &quot;a brilliant performance. It says precisely the things which need most saying and says them with rare courage and integrity. I know of no other modern book from which the intelligent layman can learn so much about the basic truths of economics in so short a time.&quot; In 1996, Laissez Faire Books issued a 50th anniversary edition with an introduction by publisher and presidential candidate Steve Forbes. Economist Thomas Sowell&#x27;s work has been described as following in the &quot;Bastiat-Hazlitt tradition&quot; of economic exposition.

Another of Hazlitt&#x27;s works, &quot;The Failure of the New Economics&quot; (1959), gives a detailed, chapter-by-chapter critique of John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s highly influential work &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;. With reference to Keynes&#x27;s book, Hazlitt paraphrased a quote attributed to Samuel Johnson, that he was &quot;unable to find in it a single doctrine that is both true and original. What is original in the book is not true; and what is true is not original.&quot; Hazlitt also published three books on the subject of inflation, including &quot;From Bretton Woods to World Inflation&quot; (1984), and two influential works on poverty, &quot;Man vs. The Welfare State&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Conquest of Poverty&quot; (1973), thought by some to have anticipated the later work of Charles Murray in &quot;Losing Ground&quot;. Hazlitt&#x27;s major work in philosophy, such as &quot;The Foundations of Morality&quot; (1964), a treatise on ethics defending utilitarianism, builds on the work of David Hume and John Stuart Mill. Hazlitt&#x27;s 1922 work, &quot;The Way to Will-Power&quot; was characterized by Lew Rockwell as &quot;a defense of individual initiative against the deterministic claims of Freudian psychoanalysis.&quot; In contrast to many other thinkers on the political right, Hazlitt was an agnostic with regard to religious beliefs.

In &quot;A New Constitution Now&quot; (1942), published during Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s unprecedented third term as President of the United States, Hazlitt called for the replacement of the existing fixed-term presidential tenure in the United States with a more Anglo-European system of &quot;cabinet&quot; government, under which a head of government who had lost the confidence of the legislature or cabinet might be removed from office after a no-confidence vote in as few as 30 days. In 1951, following Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1945, the United States imposed presidential term limits. Hazlitt&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Great Idea&quot;, reissued in 1966 as &quot;Time Will Run Back&quot;, depicts rulers of a centrally-planned socialist dystopia discovering, amid the resulting economic chaos, the need to restore a market pricing-system, private ownership of capital goods and competitive markets.

== Personal life ==
Henry was born to Stuart Clark and Bertha (Zauner) Hazlitt on November 28, 1894, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They resided at 819 North Broad Street in Philadelphia. The Hazlitt family was originally from England, although his paternal grandmother was from Ireland. His maternal grandparents were German immigrants. Henry&#x27;s father, a clerk, died of diabetes when Henry was only five months old. His mother, Bertha, then married Frederick E. Piebes, who was engaged in manufacturing, and they resided in Brooklyn, where Henry was raised. Henry is listed on the 1905 New York state census as Henry S. Piebes, and he is listed on Frederick&#x27;s will as Henry Hazlitt Piebes, Frederick&#x27;s adopted son. His stepfather died in 1907, leaving Henry to support his mother and probably leading to the ambition that enabled him to work at the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; while he was still a teenager.

In 1929, Hazlitt married Valerie Earle, daughter of the noted photographer and Vitagraph film director William P. S. Earle. They were married by the pacifist minister John Haynes Holmes, but later divorced. In 1936, he married Frances Kanes, the author of &quot;The Concise Bible&quot;, with whom he later collaborated to produce an anthology of the Stoic philosophers, &quot;The Wisdom of the Stoics: Selections from Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius&quot; (1984). They were married until Frances&#x27; death in 1991.

Hazlitt died at the age of 98 in Fairfield, Connecticut. At the time of his death, he resided in Wilton, Connecticut.

== Legacy ==
Hazlitt was a prolific writer, authoring 25 works in his lifetime.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference (or &quot;CPAC&quot;) named Hazlitt as one of the &quot;[i]ntellectual leaders&quot; (along with Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman, Russell Kirk, James Burnham and Frank Meyer) who had &quot;shaped so much of our thoughts...&quot;

Ludwig von Mises said at a dinner honoring Hazlitt: &quot;In this age of the great struggle in favor of freedom and the social system in which men can live as free men, you are our leader. You have indefatigably fought against the step-by-step advance of the powers anxious to destroy everything that human civilization has created over a long period of centuries... You are the economic conscience of our country and of our nation.&quot;

=== Hazlitt Policy Center ===
On 1 March 2019, the Young Americans for Liberty announced the launch of the Hazlitt Policy Center &quot;to provide YAL&#x27;s elected officials with modern legislation, facts, and strategies to give them the extra muscle they need to be effective liberty legislators.&quot;

<text>The newton-metre or newton-meter (also non-hyphenated, newton metre or newton meter; symbol N⋅m or N m) is the unit of torque (also called ) in the International System of Units (SI). One newton-metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long.

The unit is also used less commonly as a unit of work, or energy, in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy, the joule. In this usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement in the direction of the force, and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum (i.e. the lever arm length) as it does when used to express torque. This usage is generally discouraged, since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton-metres is a torque or a quantity of energy. &quot;Even though torque has the same dimension as energy (SI unit joule), the joule is never used for expressing torque&quot;.

Newton-metres and joules are dimensionally equivalent in the sense that they have the same expression in SI base units,

::formula_1

but are distinguished in terms of applicable kind of quantity, to avoid misunderstandings when a torque is mistaken for an energy or vice versa. Similar examples of dimensionally equivalent units include Pa versus J/m3, Bq versus Hz, and ohm versus ohm per square.

==Conversion factors==
*1 kilogram-force metre = 9.80665 N⋅m

*1 newton-metre ≈ 0.73756215 pound-force-feet
*1 pound-foot ≡ 1 pound-force-foot ≈ 1.35581795 N⋅m
*1 ounce-inch ≡ 1 ounce-force-inch ≈ 7.06155181 mN⋅m (millinewton-metres)
*1 dyne-centimetre = 10−7 N⋅m

<text>The racket-tailed treepie (Crypsirina temia) is an Asian treepie, a member of the crow family, Corvidae.

It has a velvety-black forehead of short, plush black feathers with the rest of the bird being an oily green colour, though appearing black in dim light. The tail feathers which in this species are long and broaden at the tail&#x27;s end are black also with a greenish tinge, as are the wings. The iris of the bird is a turquoise-blue darkening towards the pupil to a very deep or near black. The bill, legs and feet are black.

This bird occurs in southern Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Indo-China, Sumatra, Java and Bali in scrub and secondary growth, open fields and gardens, bamboo thickets and open forest often near villages.

It almost always feeds in trees (arboreal) never feeding from the ground though coming down to bathe on occasion. It moves through the trees with great agility and uses its remarkable tail as a balancing organ. It eats mainly insects and fruit.

A cup shaped nest is built in bamboo or shrubs especially thorny ones often surrounded by open grassy areas and normally lays 2–4 eggs.

The voice is usually described as harsh and unattractive. It has several described calls but a whining call is often heard.

<doc id="215758" wikidata="Q74251" url="?curid=215758" title="Ruhr Red Army">
<text>The Ruhr Red Army, also Red Ruhr Army (: ), was an impromptu army of 50,000 to 80,000 left-wing workers that fought in the Ruhr uprising of 13 March to 6 April 1920 in Germany&#x27;s Ruhr region. The uprising was sparked by the right-wing Kapp Putsch in Berlin and had as its goal the establishment of a soviet-style council republic in Germany. 

After an agreement to end a general strike in the region failed, the German government sent in Reichswehr (regular army) and Freikorps (paramilitary) units to put down the rebellion. They acted with considerable brutality, including summary executions of prisoners and the killing of wounded fighters. The government victory cost the lives of over 1,000 workers and about 600 Reichswehr and Freikorps soldiers.

==Formation==

The majority of Germany&#x27;s left-of-centre political parties responded to the right-wing Kapp Putsch of 13 March – 18 March 1920 with a call for a nationwide general strike. It drew around 12 million workers and was largely responsible for the quick failure of the attempted coup.

In the Ruhr, the workers did not stop with the general strike. Spontaneously formed local executive councils () took power over local governments after disarming the security police and regular army (Reichswehr) forces. By 22 March, the entire Ruhr district was in their hands. 

The councils used local workers&#x27; defence () units during armed action. Their weapons came from citizens&#x27; defence () groups and, after their first successful engagements, from defeated Freikorps units. It was from the workers&#x27; defence groups that the Red Ruhr Army was formed.

At its peak the Red Ruhr Army&#x27;s strength is estimated to have been 50,000 to 80,000 members. Of those who belonged to union-based organizations, a small majority came from the free unions and the remainder from the anarcho-syndicalist Free Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (FAUD). Among members of political parties, 60% were members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), 30% from the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and 10% from the Social Democrats (SPD).

== Armed rebellion ==

On 24 March, local and national government authorities signed the Bielefeld Agreement with the more moderate political parties and executive councils. The agreement called for the Red Ruhr Army to hand over its weapons, with a promise of amnesty for those who had broken the law in defence of the government against the putschists. Leaders of the Red Ruhr Army, however, thought that it would be better to fight than accept the compromises in the agreement. 

At a meeting a week later, on 1 April, the leaders of the Red Ruhr Army agreed that there was no point in continuing the fight, but the Army had by then splintered into numerous largely independent groups over which the leaders had no control. In addition, urgent calls for help were coming in from local citizens and city administrations reporting that Red Ruhr Army members were engaging in extortion, looting and shootings. The Berlin government then sent in both Reichswehr and Freikorps troops on 2 April.

The experienced and heavily armed government troops quickly ended the uprising with acts of violence and cruelty that dwarfed the workers&#x27; &quot;red terror&quot;. There were mass arrests and shootings without it always being clear whether the victims were members of the Red Ruhr Army. Wounded fighters were shot, as were ten female medics with the Red Ruhr Army who were carrying pistols. Many fighters were reported as having been shot while fleeing, indicating that they were shot in the back. Fifty had been executed and an additional 205 condemned by drumhead courts before the government in Berlin forbade them on 3 April. General Oskar von Watter, who was in charge of government troops in the region, defended himself from other charges that his men had engaged in unlawful behaviour by citing a letter from the Ministry of the Reichswehr that stated, &quot;You are given complete freedom to do what the situation demands&quot;.

On 5 April a large part of the Red Ruhr Army fled to the French occupied zone of the Rhineland. The skirmish that took place in Gelsenkirchen the next day marked the final end of the uprising and of the Red Ruhr Army. The number of insurgents killed has never been accurately determined. Historian Heinrich August Winkler puts the number at &quot;well over 1,000&quot;, the majority of them killed after being captured. The Reichswehr lost 208 killed and 123 missing; the security police 41 dead. The number of Freikorps deaths has been put at 273.

<text>The tax horsepower or taxable horsepower was an early system by which taxation rates for automobiles were reckoned in some European countries such as Britain, Belgium, Germany, France and Italy; some US states like Illinois charged license plate purchase and renewal fees for passenger automobiles based on taxable horsepower. The tax horsepower rating was computed not from actual engine power but by a mathematical formula based on cylinder dimensions. At the beginning of the twentieth century, tax power was reasonably close to real power; as the internal combustion engine developed, real power became larger than nominal taxable power by a factor of ten or more.

== Britain==
The so-called RAC horsepower rating was devised in 1910 by the RAC at the invitation of the British government. The formula is:
: formula_1

where:
: formula_2 is the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches,
: formula_3 is the number of cylinders

The formula was calculated from total piston surface area (i.e., &quot;bore&quot; only). The factor of 2.5 accounts for characteristics that were widely seen in engines at the time, such as a mean effective pressure in the cylinder of and a maximum piston speed of .

The system introduced a somewhat progressive way of taxing higher-value cars more than low-cost ones but was also introduced to protect the domestic British motor industry from foreign imports, especially the Ford Model T. Henry Ford&#x27;s mass production methods meant that the Model T was competitively priced with British-built cars despite being a much larger, more durable and more powerful car than other available similarly-priced models. In 1912 Ford opened a factory to build Model Ts in Manchester, to circumvent the import tariffs that, up to that point, had increased the effective price of foreign cars. Under the RAC&#x27;s formula the Model T was a 22 &#x27;tax horsepower&#x27; car, making it more expensive to run than its British-built rivals on sale for the same price.

At first the RAC rating was usually representative of the car&#x27;s actual (brake) horsepower, but as engine design and technology progressed in the 1920s and 1930s these two figures began to diverge, with engines making much more power than their RAC ratings suggested: by 1924 the engine of the Austin Seven (named for its 7 hp rating) produced 10.5 brake horsepower, 50 percent more than its official rating.

It became common for the name of a model to include both its RAC tax horsepower and its actual power output, such as the Wolseley 14/60 and the Alvis 12/70 of 1938.

To minimise tax ratings British designers developed engines with very long stroke and low piston surface area. Another effect was the multiplicity of models: Sevens, Eights, Nines, Tens, Elevens, Twelves, Fourteens, Sixteens etc., each to fit with a taxation class. Larger, more lightly stressed engines may have been equally economical to run and, in less variety, produced much more economically. The system discouraged manufacturers from switching to more fuel-efficient overhead valve engines as these generally required larger bores, while the established sidevalve layout could easily use very narrow bores. Despite OHV engines having significant benefits in economy, refinement and performance, the RAC system made these engines more expensive to own because it placed them in a higher tax class than sidevalve engines of identical power output. Despite this, by 1948 the Standard Flying Twelve, a typical mid-size saloon, produced from a engine, nearly four times as much horsepower as the RAC system suggested.

While the RAC system had protected the home market from the import of large-engined low-priced mass-produced American cars, the need for roomy generously proportioned cars for export was now paramount and the British government abandoned the tax horsepower system with effect from 1 January 1947 replacing it at first with a tax on cubic capacity, which was in turn replaced by a flat tax applying from 1 January 1948. However British cars and cars in other countries applying the same approach to automobile taxation continued to feature long, relatively narrow cylinders even in the 1950s and 1960s, partly because limited investment meant that new car models often had new bodies but their engines were carried over from earlier generations.

The emphasis on long strokes, combined with the nature of British roads in the pre-motorway era, meant that British engines tended to deliver strong low- and mid-range torque for their size, but low maximum speeds. The long stroke also meant that piston speeds and the load on the big end bearings became potentially damaging at high power outputs. Many smaller British cars did not cope well with sustained cruising at or more, which led to reliability problems when the vehicles were exported to other markets, especially the United States. Cars such as the Austin A40, the Morris Minor and the Hillman Minx all achieved notable initial sales success in the US in the late 1940s, until the short service life of the engines when asked to routinely drive long distances at freeway speeds became clear. Other imports originating in countries with different tax rules and existent high speed road networks, in particular the Volkswagen Beetle, proved more reliable, and achieved greater sales success.

==Australia==
In Australia, the various states had their own automobile taxation system. Several depended on the RAC formula, but the flaws of this system were well known as early as 1909. Another formula was the Dendy-Marshall formula, which included an engine&#x27;s stroke. Several Australian states used Dendy-Marshall, although Western Australia reverted to RAC hp in 1957. The Union of South Africa also depended on Dendy-Marshall, at least in the 1920s. The Automobile Club of Australia&#x27;s &quot;A.C.A. formula&quot; used the same calculations as did Dendy-Marshall formula. The Australian Bureau of Statistics used RAC hp in their &quot;Registration of New Motor Vehicles, Make of Vehicles, Australia&quot; statistics until this publication was discontinued in June 1976.

Several Australian states also added vehicle weight to the power rating, to get a power-weight unit which determined taxation.

The Dendy-Marshall / A.C.A. formula is as follows:

:formula_4

where:
: formula_5 = nominal horsepower 
: formula_2 = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches
: formula_7 = the length (or stroke) of the cylinder in inches
: formula_3 = the number of cylinders

==United States==

During the early twentieth century, automobiles in the United States were specified with a figure identical to RAC horsepower and computed using the same formula; this was known either as &quot;NACC horsepower&quot; (named for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce), &quot;ALAM horsepower&quot; (for NACC&#x27;s predecessor, the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers), or &quot;SAE horsepower&quot; (for the Society of Automotive Engineers). (This last term should not be confused with later horsepower ratings by the SAE.) This value is still used for taxation and license fee purposes in the State of Missouri for passenger vehicles, with electric vehicles assigned to the 12–23 Horsepower bracket by statute.

==Continental Europe==
Although tax horsepower was computed on a similar basis in several other European countries during the two or three decades before the Second World War, continental cylinder dimensions were quoted in millimetres. As a result of rounding when converting the formula between the two measurement systems, a British tax horse-power unit ended up being worth 1.014 continental (i.e. French) tax horse-power units.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the tax power depended on the cubic capacity of the engine in cubic centimetres at the rate of 1 tax horse power for every .

===France===

The &quot;Cheval Fiscal&quot;, often abbreviated to CV from &quot;chevaux-vapeur&quot; (literally &quot;steam horses&quot;) in tax law, is used for the issuing of French registration certificates known as &quot;cartes grises&quot; (&quot;grey cards&quot;). It is an administrative unit originally calculated partly from the power of the engine and used to calculate the amount of tax that may be due at the time of registration.

The Citroën 2CV (two tax horsepower) was the car that kept such a name for the longest time.

Its use in France dates from 1 January 1913. It was updated in 1956, with further revisions in 1978 and a new emission-based system introduced in 1998.

It was originally defined using the following formula:

:formula_9

where:
: formula_3 is the number of cylinders,
: formula_2 is the cylinder bore in centimetres,
: formula_7 is the stroke in centimetres,
: formula_13 is the maximum engine speed in revolutions per second, derived from manufacturers&#x27; performance claims,
: formula_14 is a coefficient depending on the number of cylinders (single-cylinder engine : 0.00020; two-cylinder engine : 0.00017; four-cylinder engine: 0.00015; six-or-more-cylinder engine: 0.00013)
&lt;br&gt;

====1956 formula====
In a circular issued on 28 December 1956, the chevaux fiscaux was defined as:

: formula_15

where:
: formula_16 = puissance administrative,
: formula_14 = constant of 0.00015,
: formula_3 = number of cylinders,
: formula_2 = bore in centimetres,
: formula_7 = stroke in centimetres,
: formula_21 = speed of rotation in revolutions per second

The result is multiplied by 0.7 for a four-stroke, diesel engine (also for wood gas-powered vehicles or those running on CNG). Since formula_21 and formula_14 are both constants while formula_3, formula_2, and formula_7 combine to form the engine&#x27;s displacement, a commission simplified the formula to:

: formula_27

where:
: formula_16 = puissance administrative,
: formula_29 = displacement in litres (1 L = ),
: formula_14 = constant of 5.7294 for petrol engines and 4.0106 for diesel engines

====1978 formula====
A new system was announced on 23 December 1977 to come into force on 1 January 1978 calculated by the following formula:

: formula_31

where:
: formula_16 = puissance administrative,
: formula_33 = coefficient of 1 for petrol or 0.7 for diesel,
: formula_29 = engine capacity in cubic centimetres,
: formula_14 = parameter calculated from a weighted arithmetic average speed in kilometres per hour theoretically reached by the vehicle at an engine speed of 1000 revolutions per minute in each gearbox ratio (see dropdown table to the right for more details).

====1998 formula====
From 1998 until January 2020, the fiscal tax depended on a standardised value of carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometre (g/km) and the maximum engine power in kilowatts (kW). If C is the amount of released and P the engine power, then:

:formula_36

formula_37 is expressed in horsepower, rounded to the nearest integer. The official emission rate of included in the calculation is taken from the European certificate of conformity.

===Germany===
Tax horse-power (&quot;Steuer-PS&quot;) was introduced in Germany on 3 June 1906 however in contrast to many regions, i.e. British and French tax horsepower formulae above, it was calculated based on the overall engine displacement from its implementation.

The German formula applied a higher tax horse-power factor to two stroke engine cars than to four-stroke engined cars based on the fact each cylinder in a two-stroke engine fires (has a power stroke) every revolution whereas an Otto cycle or four-stroke cylinder only fires every second revolution .

The formulae for calculating units of tax horsepower (&quot;Steuer-PS&quot;) were as follows:

four-stroke engined cars = formula_38

two-stroke engined cars = formula_39

where:
: formula_40 = the number of cylinders
: formula_41 = the diameter (or bore) of each cylinder
: formula_42 = the stroke length of each cylinder

Incomplete fractions were rounded up to the nearest whole number so a four-stroke engined car of would end up designated as a 4 PS (or four horsepower) car for car tax purposes.

After April 1928, recognizing the logic of the linear relationship between tax horsepower and engine capacity, the authorities simply set car tax rates according to engine size for passenger cars. (For commercial vehicles vehicle tax became a function of vehicle weight.) Attempts to correlate new tax horsepower values with old ones result in small differences due to roundings used in the new formula which are, for most purposes, unimportant.

In 1933 the Hitler government came into power and identified the promotion of the auto industry as key to economic recovery: new cars purchased after April 1933 were no longer burdened by an annual car tax charge and German passenger car production surged from 41,727 in 1932 to 276,804 in 1938. Thereafter war and military defeat led to a change in car tax policy and after 1945 tax horse-power returned in West Germany, applying the 1928 formula, as a determinant of annual car tax on new cars purchased in or after 1945. However, the introduction of tax on road fuel in 1951 and progressive increases in fuel tax thereafter reduced the importance of annual car tax so that today far more of the tax on car ownership is collected via fuel taxes than via annual car tax.

===Italy===
Fiscal horsepower is still used in Italy for insurance purposes; it was formerly used also for car property taxation and it is based on engine displacement. Following the 1973 oil crisis up until the 1990s, it was heavily imposed on vehicles with engines larger than 2,000 cc, prompting Italian car makers to fit turbochargers for extra power without enlarging the displacement.

===Spain===
Fiscal horsepower also lives on in Spain, but is defined simply in terms of overall engine capacity. It therefore encourages small engines, but does not influence the ratio of cylinder bore to stroke. The current Spanish definition does, however, add a factor that varies in order to favour four-stroke engines over two-stroke engines.

:formula_43

where:
: formula_44 = Tax Horsepower (&quot;Potencia fiscal&quot;),
: formula_45 = 0.08 for four-stroke engines, 0.11 for two-stroke engines,
: formula_2 = cylinder bore in centimetres,
: formula_47 = stroke length in centimetres,
: formula_3 = Number of cylinders

For vehicles where the above formula cannot be applied (e.g. electric vehicles), the tax horsepower is derived from the effective engine power (which is defined by law as the maximum power that the engine can provide after being used at full power from 30 minutes, which is normally lower than the rated engine power). Until 1998 the nominal power of the engine was used instead of the effective power.

:formula_49

where:
: formula_44 = Tax Horsepower (&quot;Potencia fiscal&quot;),
: formula_16 = effective power in kW

===Switzerland===
The 26 cantons of Switzerland used (and use) a variety of different taxation methods. Originally, all of Switzerland used the tax horsepower, calculated as follows:

: formula_52

where:
: formula_40 = the number of cylinders,
: formula_41 = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in cm,
: formula_55 = the piston stroke in cm
or times engine displacement in cc

The limits between the horsepower denominations were drawn at either 0.49, 0.50, or 0.51 in different cantons. Thus, the eight horsepower category would cover cars of about 7.5–8.5 CV. In 1973 Berne switched to a taxation system based on vehicle weight, and a few other cantons followed. In 1986 Ticino switched to a system based on a calculation including engine size and weight. The tax horsepower system remained in effect for seven cantons long into the 21st century; however, , although quite likely earlier, Geneva was the only canton to still base road tax purely on tax horsepower. The plethora of different taxation systems has contributed to there always being an uncommonly wide variety of different cars marketed in Switzerland.

==Japan==
In pre-war Japan, different prefectures had different automobile tax structures. Tokyo Prefecture was naturally the strictest, due to the population and vehicle density there, and used a tax horsepower system of their own devising:

: formula_56

where
: formula_2 = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches,
: formula_55 = the piston stroke in inches,
: formula_3 = the number of cylinders

Unlike the British system, the Tokyo system favored short-stroked engines, but since the tax categories were rather wide and only represented a portion of vehicle taxes it had less impact on sales. In 1950 new legislation was passed that taxed engine displacement in 500 cc increments. The automobile tax is paid every year during the road tax obligation.

==Impact on engine design and on auto-industry development==
The fiscal benefits of reduced cylinder diameters (bore) in favor of longer cylinders (stroke) in Britain and Ireland may have been a factor in encouraging the proliferation of relatively small six-cylinder-engined models appearing in Europe in the 1930s, as the market began to open up for faster middle-weight models. The system clearly perpetuated side-valve engines in countries where the taxation system encouraged these engine designs, and delayed the adoption of overhead valve engines because the small cylinder diameter reduced the space available for overhead valves and the lengthy combustion chamber in any case reduced their potential for improving combustion efficiency.

Another effect was to make it very expensive to run cars imported from countries where there was no fiscal incentive to minimise cylinder diameters: this may have limited car imports from the US to Europe during a period when western governments were employing naked protectionist policies in response to economic depression, and thereby encouraged US auto-makers wishing to exploit the European auto-markets to set up their own dedicated subsidiary plants in the larger European markets.

Taxation can modify incentives and tax horsepower is no exception. Large capacity (displacement) engines are penalized, so engineers working where engine capacity is taxed are encouraged to minimize capacity. This rarely happened in the US, where license plate fees, even adjusted for horsepower ratings, were comparatively much lower than European car taxes.

<doc id="215761" wikidata="Q652087" url="?curid=215761" title="Incesticide">
<text>is a compilation album by the American rock band Nirvana. It consists of their 1990 non-album single &quot;Sliver&quot;, B-sides, demos, outtakes, cover versions, and radio broadcast recordings, and as such is not the official follow-up to the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. The album was released on December 14, 1992, in Europe, and December 15, 1992, in the United States. It eventually reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background==
Early in 1992, Jonathan Poneman of Sub Pop contacted Gary Gersh, who had previously signed Nirvana to DGC Records, to inform him that Sub Pop still had a number of unreleased early Nirvana recordings in their possession. The band had intended to release the material via Sub Pop and cynically called it &quot;Cash Cow&quot;. However, Sub Pop could not match Geffen Records&#x27; distribution network, and the band felt that getting the material maximum exposure was important. Sub Pop sold the recordings to Geffen for &quot;a six-figure amount&quot; on the condition that the band would create and approve the release of an album by Christmas 1992.

At the time, the majority of the material on &quot;Incesticide&quot; was circulating within fan communities (albeit in lower quality). It was widely reported in the music press that the band wanted to offer fans a higher-quality alternative. In the book &quot;Cobain Unseen&quot;, Charles R. Cross writes that Kurt Cobain agreed to the release of this compilation because he was allowed complete control over the album&#x27;s artwork.

Since the songs were recorded in different sessions and some were recorded when Nirvana did not have a stable formation, the album includes recordings by four different drummers: Chad Channing, Dan Peters, Dale Crover, and Dave Grohl.

==Songs==

===Previously unreleased===
*&quot;Hairspray Queen&quot;
*&quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot;
*&quot;Big Long Now&quot;

===Alternate versions===
*&quot;Been a Son&quot; was a song originally released on the 1989 &quot;Blew&quot; EP. The version on &quot;Incesticide&quot; was recorded in 1991 during a BBC Radio 1 live studio session.
*&quot;(New Wave) Polly&quot; is a hard rock version of the &quot;Nevermind&quot; album track &quot;Polly&quot;. The version on &quot;Incesticide&quot; was recorded in 1991 during a BBC Radio 1 live studio session.
*&quot;Aneurysm&quot; was a song originally released as a b-side to the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; single, the version on &quot;Incesticide&quot; was recorded two months later during a BBC Radio 1 live studio session.

===Previously released===
*&quot;Dive&quot; and &quot;Sliver&quot; were released on the &quot;Sliver&quot; single in 1990. &quot;Dive&quot; was also previously released on &quot;The Grunge Years&quot; compilation album in 1991.
*&quot;Stain&quot; was released on the &quot;Blew EP&quot; in 1989.
*The three cover songs, &quot;Turnaround&quot; (Devo), &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; and &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; (The Vaselines) were released on the &quot;Hormoaning&quot; EP in 1992, which was only released in Japan and Australia. All three songs were recorded live in 1990 during a BBC Radio 1 live studio session.
*&quot;Mexican Seafood&quot; appeared on the 1989 &quot;Teriyaki Asthma Volume 1&quot; compilation.
*&quot;Beeswax&quot; appeared on the 1991 &quot;Kill Rock Stars&quot; compilation album.
*&quot;Downer&quot; appears as a bonus track on the 1990 CD release of Nirvana&#x27;s 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The cover art was painted by Cobain, who is credited as &quot;Kurdt Kobain&quot; in the liner notes. The rubber duck seen on the album&#x27;s back cover belonged to art-designer Robert Fisher. It can also be seen on the front sleeve of the compilation album DGC Rarities.

The front cover prominently displays a poppy, hinting at Cobain&#x27;s struggle with heroin use.

The first several pressings of the album contained liner notes written by Cobain, including a statement decrying homophobia, racism and misogyny:

Versions of the album containing the liner notes by Cobain could be found at record stores as late as 1998. Initial copies in the U.S. and Canada also contained a Parental Advisory label.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews. &quot;Nobody really wants a &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot;-type assortment of Peel/Goodier sessions, B-sides, demos and obscurities in the place of a proper studio album,&quot; observed Andrew Perry in &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;But, hell, wouldn&#x27;t you try and put an end to the consumer madness going on in your name? And harvest some of the money for yourself? Anyway, people might start talking about the music again…&quot; In a review for AllMusic, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the song &quot;Aneurysm&quot; was &quot;perhaps the greatest single song the group ever recorded&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Incesticide&quot; was released on December 14, 1992, in the United Kingdom, and on December 15, 1992, in the United States. The record label, Geffen, decided against heavily promoting the album, possibly to avoid a &quot;Nirvana burnout&quot; as the band had released &quot;Nevermind&quot; and four singles in the preceding fifteen months.

Despite this lack of promotion and being a collection of old and new material, &quot;Incesticide&quot; debuted at number 51 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 500,000 copies in two months. The album is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 17, and peaked at number 14.

On November 23, 2012, &quot;Incesticide&quot; was re-released on vinyl as a limited two-LP 45 RPM edition for its 20th anniversary.

<text>Shawntae Harris-Dupart (née Harris; born April 14, 1974), better known by her stage name Da Brat, is an American rapper. Born and raised in Chicago, she began her career in 1992 and signed with Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s So So Def Recordings two years later to release her debut studio album, &quot;Funkdafied&quot; (1994). Receiving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it became the first album by a female hip hop solo act to do so.

In 1996, Da Brat released her second full-length album, &quot;Anuthatantrum&quot;, which included the single &quot;Ghetto Love&quot; featuring T-Boz of TLC. Over the course of the 1990s, Brat came to be recognized for her comedic timing, her laidback attitude, and her many memorable guest-spots on other artists&#x27; songs. She was featured with Kris Kross on the title track of their album &quot;Da Bomb&quot; (1993), as well as on their third album, &quot;Young, Rich and Dangerous&quot; (1996). A long-time friend of singer Mariah Carey, Brat contributed a rap verse to the So So Def remix of Carey&#x27;s #1 single &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; in 1996, which also featured Dupri and fellow So So Def group Xscape. That same year, Brat made her feature film debut in &quot;Kazaam&quot; (1996), starring Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

The late 1990s saw Da Brat featured in many high-profile collaborations, including her appearance on a remix of Dru Hill&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;In My Bed&quot;. That same year, she and Dupri also appeared on a remix of Mariah Carey&#x27;s #1 single &quot;Honey&quot;, entitled &quot;Honey (So So Def mix)&quot;; Brat also recorded a hit remix of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night (Not Tonight)&quot; with Lil&#x27; Kim, Lisa &quot;Left-Eye&quot; Lopes (of TLC), Angie Martinez, and Missy Elliott.

<text>Terrance Cocheeks Kelly (born March 28, 1971), known professionally as Mr. Cheeks, is an American rapper from South Jamaica, Queens. He is best known for his 2001 single &quot;Lights, Camera, Action!&quot; (featuring Missy Elliott, P. Diddy and Petey Pablo), which peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Prior, he performed as a member of the hip hop group Lost Boyz from 1995 to 1999, and thereafter signed with Universal Records to pursue a solo career.

&quot;Lights, Camera, Action!&quot; preceded the release of his debut studio album &quot;John P. Kelly&quot; (2001), which was met with moderate critical and commercial reception along with its follow up, &quot;Back Again!&quot; (2003). He is also known for guest appearance on Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;The Jump Off,&quot; which peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== Biography ==
=== 1991–2019: Lost Boyz ===
Mr. Cheeks, who was mentored by his uncle Gil Scott-Heron, along with bandmates Freaky Tah (1971–1999), Spigg Nice and Pretty Lou made up Lost Boyz. The Lost Boyz practiced a sincere, literate, non-sensational style of New York hip-hop and produced a number of singles including; &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless&quot; (1994), &quot;Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz &amp; Benz&quot; (1995) and &quot;Renee&quot; (1996). Lost Boyz gained worldwide critical acclaim following the release of the albums; &quot;Legal Drug Money&quot; in 1996, &quot;Love, Peace &amp; Nappiness&quot; in 1997, &quot;LB IV Life&quot; in 1999, &quot;LB Next Generation&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Legacy&quot; in 2020.

=== 2001–09: Solo career ===
Mr. Cheeks became a solo artist in 2001. His debut solo album, &quot;John P. Kelly&quot;, named for both his cousin and his grandfather, featured the hit single &quot;Lights, Camera, Action!&quot;. The album also included a collaboration with longtime friend and business partner, Stephen Marley, (son of reggae artist Bob Marley) featuring the ballad &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; (recorded in Freaky Tah&#x27;s memory) and the reggae-flavored &quot;Mama Say&quot;. In 2003, Mr. Cheeks released the follow-up album, &quot;Back Again!&quot; The single off the album was &quot;Crush On You&quot; and it featured Mario Winans. In the fall of 2003, Cheeks separated from Universal, forming his own label, Diane&#x27;s Boyz. Cheeks was also featured on Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s single, &quot;The Jump Off.&quot;

<doc id="215772" wikidata="Q2779733" url="?curid=215772" title="What's the 411?">
<text>What&#x27;s the 411? is the debut album by American R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige. It was released on July 28, 1992, by Uptown Records and MCA Records. After signing a record contract with Uptown, Blige began working on the album with producer Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. Other producers and songwriters included DeVante Swing, Tony Dofat, Dave Hall, Mark Morales and Mark &quot;Cory&quot; Rooney. The resulting music covered hip hop soul, contemporary R&amp;B, and new jack swing styles.

&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was also met with positive reviews from critics, who applauded Blige&#x27;s singing and the combination of hip hop and soul music, which led to her being named the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot;. The album peaked at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and eventually sold 3.5 million copies.

==Background==
At the age of 17, Blige recorded a cover version of Anita Baker&#x27;s &quot;Caught Up in the Rapture&quot; in a recording booth at a local mall. Her mother&#x27;s boyfriend at the time later played the cassette to recording artist and A&amp;R runner for Uptown Records, Jeff Redd. Redd then sent it to the president and chief executive officer of the label, Andre Harrell. Blige met with Harrell in 1990 and performed the song for him. She was signed to Uptown and became the label&#x27;s youngest and third female recording artist (after Finesse N&#x27; Synquis).

== Recording ==
After being signed to Uptown Records, Blige began working with record producer Puff Daddy. He became the executive producer and produced a majority of the album. The title, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, derived from Blige&#x27;s past occupation as a 4-1-1 operator; it was also an indication by Blige of being the &quot;real deal&quot;. The music was described as &quot;revelatory on a frequent basis&quot;. Blige was noted for having a &quot;tough girl persona and streetwise lyrics&quot;. The album begins with &quot;Leave a Message&quot;, a collection of Blige&#x27;s answering machine messages over a drum beat. The following two tracks, &quot;Reminisce&quot; and &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, are melancholy songs that are overlaid with hip hop beats. A cover of Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; followed.

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was released on July 28, 1992. It peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also peaked at number 53 on the UK Albums Chart. The first single released to promote the album was &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, originally from 1991 film &quot;Strictly Business&quot;. It reached the number 29 position on the pop charts and number 1 on the R&amp;B charts in 1992. The next single, &quot;Real Love&quot; (#7 pop, #1 R&amp;B, 1992), made Blige one of the year&#x27;s biggest crossover successes.

With the album, Blige became the most successful new female R&amp;B artist of 1992 in the United States, according to music scholar Dave McAleer. Reporting on the album&#x27;s commercial success for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that year, Dave DiMartino said Blige&#x27;s &quot;powerful, soulful voice and hip-hop attitude&quot; made her &quot;solidly connected with an audience that has never seen a woman do new jack swing but loves it just the same&quot;. The following year, a remix album was released to further market &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, while &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; reached number 28 on the pop charts as a single.

In 2000, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over three million copies. As of July 2022, it has sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.

==Creation of Hip Hop Soul==
The release of this album would influence a larger wave within the Hip-Hop sphere, specifically championing the Hip-Hop Soul genre. Daphne Brooks writes about the change this album evoked in her article crediting Blige with pioneering the &quot;Hip-Hop Soul&quot; sound, which combines the grit and rhythm of Hip-Hop with the emotional depth of traditional R&amp;B. She goes on to explain that this fusion provided a platform for voicing the struggles and triumphs of young Black women in urban America. The album features an emphasized vulnerability and raw sound from Blige that would eventually come to be a staple sound in the Hip-Hop Soul genre. &quot;What&#x27;s the 411&quot;is able to achieve the fused sound between Hip-Hop and R&amp;B through this vocal sound as well as the lyrical content of the album. Blige conveys themes and stories of desire, betrayal, abandonment, affairs, marriage, domesticity, spirituality, sisterhood, and emotional violence. Before the release of this album, these storylines that represent experiences more relevant to Black women were rarely expressed in mainstream Hip-Hop. As a result, this album sparked a sub-genre that was based on Hip-Hop aesthetics, bass, and artists while appealing to a more female-dominated audience.

==Critical reception==

&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1992, Havelock Nelson hailed it as &quot;one of the most accomplished fusions of soul values and hip-hop to date&quot; while comparing Blige&#x27;s &quot;powerful voice&quot; to Khan, Anita Baker, and Caron Wheeler. Connie Johnson from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was particularly impressed by her rendition of &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, calling the latter track &quot;one of those perfect singer-to-song matches&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine said the album succeeded because of Blige&#x27;s &quot;fly-girl attitude&quot; and singing ability, even though &quot;she may not be Chaka Khan or Gladys Knight&quot;. Mitchell May was more critical in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, writing that aside from the title track and &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was marred by dull production and &quot;silly lyrics&quot; depriving the singer of self-esteem. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was largely unimpressed, grading the album a &quot;dud&quot; in his consumer guide. He later upgraded his score to a one-star honorable mention—indicating &quot;a worthy effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like&quot;; he named &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot; as highlights while writing that &quot;real is not enough, but attached to the right voice it&#x27;s something to build on&quot;.

The album was voted the year&#x27;s 30th best in the Pazz &amp; Jop—an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. It also earned Blige two Soul Train Music Awards in 1993: Best New R&amp;B Artist and Best R&amp;B Album, Female.

&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; has since been viewed by critics as one of the 1990s&#x27; most important records. Blige&#x27;s combination of vocals over a hip hop beat proved influential in contemporary R&amp;B. With the album, she was dubbed the reigning &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot;, Stanton Swihart wrote in a retrospective review for AllMusic. He called it &quot;the decade&#x27;s most explosive, coming-out displays of pure singing prowess&quot;. According to David O&#x27;Donnell from BBC Music, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was groundbreaking in its fusion of R&amp;B hooks and hip hop beats, creating the formula for the contemporary R&amp;B of the following decade. He complimented Blige&#x27;s &quot;sweet, soulful vocals&quot;, in line with Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;rough, jagged, hip-hop beats made for a winning combination that remains one of Blige&#x27;s finest albums&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Tom Moon wrote that with the album, Blige offered &quot;a gritty undertone and a realism missing from much of the devotional love songs ruling the charts at that time.&quot;

In 2020, the album was ranked 271 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Yolanda &quot;Yo-Yo&quot; Whitaker (born August 4, 1971) is an American rapper and actress from South Los Angeles.

Much of Yo-Yo&#x27;s music advocates female empowerment. She is the protégé of gangsta rapper Ice Cube. Yo-Yo has dubbed her crew the IBWC, Intelligent Black Woman&#x27;s Coalition. She also performed on a couple of stages with Shock G&#x27;s group Digital Underground.

==Career==

===Music===
Yo-Yo first appeared as a guest on Ice Cube&#x27;s 1990 debut studio album &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; on the track &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;. Cube returned the favor by appearing on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Play with My Yo-Yo&quot;, on Yo-Yo&#x27;s 1991 debut album, &quot;Make Way for the Motherlode&quot;. Each of the videos for the singles from the album were directed by Okuwah Garrett of Power Films.

Her follow-up album released in 1992, &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, was well received by critics, partly because of its focus on positive messages and uplifting themes that heavily contrasted with the popular gangsta rap style at the time. Despite the work of producers such as DJ Muggs, this failed to translate into a hit with mainstream hip-hop audiences, and the album&#x27;s sales were considered a disappointment.

Less than a year later, Yo-Yo released her follow-up album, titled &quot;You Better Ask Somebody&quot;. The final track on the album was her third recorded hip-hop duet with Ice Cube, &quot;The Bonnie and Clyde Theme&quot;.

Yo-Yo&#x27;s next album, &quot;Total Control&quot;, was released in 1996. In 1998, Yo-Yo finished her fifth studio album, &quot;Ebony&quot;, though it was not released. In 2008, her single, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Play With My Yo-Yo&quot; was ranked number 92 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs. Later that year, she performed with MC Lyte, The Lady of Rage, and Salt-N-Pepa at the BET Hip Hop Awards. She also performed on the Arsenio Hall show in 1994 alongside many other famous rappers and rap groups. Yo-Yo opened up the show and was later followed by rappers and groups like Naughty by Nature, A Tribe Called Quest and Wu-Tang Clan.

As of 2009, Yo-Yo has been working on an EP, titled &quot;My Journey to Fearless: The Black Butterfly&quot;.

In 2013, it was announced she joined the upcoming BET reality series &quot;Hip Hop Sisters&quot; which will focus on six female rappers&#x27; lives and their attempts to relaunch their careers. Other rappers confirmed to appear are MC Lyte, Lady of Rage, Monie Love, Lil Mama, and Smooth. Yo-Yo currently hosts a cooking show on the Aspire network &quot;Downright Delicious with Yo-Yo.&quot;

===Acting===
Yo-Yo appeared in the 1991 film &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;. She had a recurring role on the television show &quot;Martin&quot; as Keylolo, the sidekick to comedian Martin Lawrence&#x27;s alter ego Sheneneh. Yo-Yo also appeared on other TV shows, including the Fox network&#x27;s &quot;New York Undercover&quot;. She made a cameo appearance in the music video for Missy Elliot&#x27;s &quot;The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)&quot;. She also appeared in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; as the voice of Kendl Johnson. She has a reoccurring role in the series Saturdays on Disney Plus starring role as skating rink owner, Duchess.

==Personal life==
Yo-Yo was in a relationship with Tupac Shakur for some time in the 1990s. She was with Shakur in the hospital shortly before he died. Later, Yo-Yo became engaged to DeAndre Windom, the former mayor of Highland Park, Michigan, in August 2012. The two married on August 17, 2013 in the Cayman Islands and divorced in 2016.

In November 2023 Yo-Yo became engaged to Kelvin J. King a successful Businessman and Real Estate Mogul from South Jamaica Queens New York City.

Yo-Yo has been active in advocating for hip-hop artists to become involved within their community. Notably, she testified in 1994 for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about whether the government should require rating labels on gangsta rap. She also founded the Yo-Yo School of Hip-Hop to use hip-hop in curriculum for at-risk students.

<doc id="215788" wikidata="Q897757" url="?curid=215788" title="Brand Nubian">
<text>Brand Nubian is an American hip hop group from New Rochelle, New York, composed of three emcees (Grand Puba, Sadat X and Lord Jamar), and formerly three DJs (DJ Alamo, DJ Sincere, and DJ Stud Doogie). Their debut studio album, &quot;One for All&quot; (1990), is one of the most popular and acclaimed alternative hip hop albums of the 1990s, known for socially conscious and political lyrics inspired by the teachings of The Nation of Gods and Earths. In 2008, About.com placed the group on its list of the 25 Greatest Rap Groups of All Time.

==History==
===The Formation and naming Brand Nubian===
In 1988, Grand Puba was looking to recruit new members to form a new band after his group Masters of Ceremony broke up. Sadat X, Lord Jamar and DJ Alamo all joined together. The group didn&#x27;t have a name or any recorded demos to shop their music. While the group was at Tommy Boy records looking for a deal, they came across Dante Ross, an executive A&amp;R at Elektra Records who liked their talents, but told them that they need a group name and a song. The group recorded their first ever demo called &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Out Like That&quot; at Jazzy Jay Studios. After the group recorded their first demo, they started looking for names, while at a session of Jazzy Jay&#x27;s studios. The word &quot;Nubian&quot; came about after Jamar was reading one of Dwight York&#x27;s books that he found inside the pages. It was meant to be a new term for African American people. &quot;Nubian&quot; was the name at the time, then later on added the word &quot;Brand&quot; as in for &quot;Brand New&quot;. Then &quot;Brand Nubian&quot; was put together. Puba stated in an interview with Jamar on the &quot;Yanadameen Godcast&quot; saying the conclusion of naming the group was at the mall in New Rochelle, when they finally made a decision for the group name. The group officially named themselves &quot;Brand Nubian&quot;.

===1989–1992===
Brand Nubian formed in 1989, and their first single, &quot;Brand Nubian&quot;, was released in 1989. Signed to Elektra Records by A&amp;R man Dante Ross, their debut album, &quot;One For All&quot;, was released in 1990. Generally acclaimed, the album drew fire for militant Five-Percenter rhetoric on tracks such as &quot;Drop the Bomb&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot;. The controversy helped selling in excess of 400,000 copies. A version of the Fab Five Freddy-directed video of the single &quot;Wake Up&quot;, featuring a black man in white-face makeup, was banned from MTV. On that channel and from official WEA sources, this image was replaced by a Baptist preacher. The singles &quot;Slow Down&quot;, &quot;All for One&quot;, and &quot;Wake Up&quot; all became hits on &quot;Billboard’s&quot; Hot Rap Tracks chart in 1991.

Shortly after the group&#x27;s debut release, Grand Puba quarreled with Sadat X and Lord Jamar, and he left the group, along with DJ Alamo, to pursue a solo career. Following this, Lord Jamar and Sadat X asked DJ Sincere to join the group in 1992. The same year, Puba released his solo debut, &quot;Reel to Reel&quot;.

At the end of 1992, Brand Nubian released the single &quot;Punks Jump up to Get Beat Down&quot;. The track created controversy because of its homophobic content such as Sadat X&#x27;s line &quot;I can freak, fly, flow, fuck up a faggot/I don&#x27;t understand their ways; I ain&#x27;t down with gays&quot;. The single charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 77. Later versions omitted the line and replaced it with different lyrics, including the version on the greatest hits compilation &quot;The Very Best of Brand Nubian&quot;.

===1992–1996===
In early 1993, Brand Nubian released their second album, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, which included the song &quot;Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down&quot; and the number 92 Hot-100 single &quot;Love Me or Leave Me Alone&quot;. That same year, the group&#x27;s song &quot;Lick Dem Muthaphuckas&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Menace II Society&quot; soundtrack.

Brand Nubian&#x27;s next release, &quot;Everything is Everything&quot;, was released in November 1994. Reviews were mixed and sales mediocre, despite the top-40 Hot Rap Tracks singles &quot;Word is Bond&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot;. In 1995, Brand Nubian broke up and its members started solo careers in music and television. That same year, Grand Puba released his second solo album, &quot;2000&quot;, featuring another Billboard Hot 100 single, &quot;I Like It (I Wanna Be Where You Are)&quot;, and Sadat X released his first solo album, &quot;Wild Cowboys&quot;, in 1996.

===1997–2000===
Brand Nubian&#x27;s original members reunited in 1997 and contributed &quot;A Child is Born&quot; to the &quot;Soul in the Hole&quot; soundtrack. In 1997, &quot;Keep It Bubblin&#x27;&quot; appeared on the &quot;Money Talks&quot; soundtrack. In 1998, Brand Nubian released the album &quot;Foundation&quot; on Arista/BMG Records. It featured contributions from producers such as DJ Premier, Buckwild, Lord Finesse, and Diamond D. The lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Your Head&quot; became, at number 54, the group&#x27;s highest-charting single on the Hot 100. In 1999, Grand Puba and Sadat X were featured on &quot;Once Again&quot;, from the first Handsome Boy Modeling School record. In 2000, Brand Nubian once again teamed up with Buckwild of D.I.T.C., releasing the single &quot;Rockin&#x27; It&quot;, after which the members, once again, pursued their solo projects. Sadat X released a solo EP in 2000, &quot;The State of New York vs. Derek Murphy&quot;.

===2001–present===

Grand Puba released his third solo effort, &quot;Understand This&quot;, in 2001, which received little attention. Brand Nubian reunited once again in 2004 for their fifth album, &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, released by Babygrande Records. Sadat X released another solo effort in 2005, titled &quot;Experience &amp; Education&quot;, to mostly positive reviews. Jamar pursued his acting career, appearing on an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, as well as episodes of &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;Third Watch&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Lord Jamar released his first solo album, &quot;The 5% Album&quot;, in June 2006, on Babygrande Records. Sadat X&#x27;s third full-length album &quot;Black October&quot; came out in October 2006. In 2007, the group released an album titled &quot;Time&#x27;s Runnin&#x27; Out&quot;, containing material recorded ten years earlier during the sessions for the 1998 &quot;Foundation&quot; album.

===2007–present: Touring===
Since 2007, following the releases of their latest group album and other solo projects, Brand Nubian would still perform and still do shows. They would perform at sold out shows in the US and Europe.

<doc id="215791" wikidata="Q111208" url="?curid=215791" title="Erythrocyte sedimentation rate">
<text>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) is the rate at which red blood cells in anticoagulated whole blood descend in a standardized tube over a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation.
To perform the test, anticoagulated blood is traditionally placed in an upright tube, known as a Westergren tube, and the distance which the red blood cells fall is measured and reported in millimetres at the end of one hour.

Since the introduction of automated analyzers into the clinical laboratory, the ESR test has been automatically performed.

The ESR is influenced by the aggregation of red blood cells: blood plasma proteins, mainly fibrinogen, promote the formation of red cell clusters called &quot;rouleaux&quot; or larger structures (interconnected rouleaux, irregular clusters). As according to Stokes&#x27; law the sedimentation velocity varies like the square of the object&#x27;s diameter, larger aggregates settle faster. While aggregation already takes place at normal physiological fibrinogen levels, these tend to increase when an inflammatory process is present, leading to increased ESR.

The ESR is increased in inflammation, pregnancy, anemia, autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), infections, some kidney diseases and some cancers (such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma). The ESR is decreased in polycythemia, hyperviscosity, sickle cell anemia, leukemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease) and congestive heart failure. Although increases in immunoglobulins usually increase the ESR, very high levels can reduce it again due to hyperviscosity of the plasma. This is especially likely with IgM-class paraproteins, and to a lesser extent, IgA-class. The basal ESR is slightly higher in females.

==Stages==
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the measure of ability of erythrocytes (red blood cell) to fall through the blood plasma and accumulate together at the base of container in one hour.

There are three stages in erythrocyte sedimentation:
# Rouleaux formation
# Sedimentation or settling stage
# Packing stage - 10 minutes (sedimentation slows and cells start to pack at the bottom of the tube)

In normal conditions, the red blood cells are negatively charged and therefore repel each other rather than stacking. ESR is also reduced by high blood viscosity, which slows the rate of fall.

==Causes of elevation==
The rate of erythrocyte sedimentation is affected by both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.

===Inflammation===
In inflammatory conditions, fibrinogen, other clotting proteins, and alpha globulin are positively charged, thus increasing the ESR. ESR begins to rise at 24 to 48 hours after the onset of acute self-limited inflammation, decreases slowly as inflammation resolves, and can take weeks to months to return to normal levels. For ESR values more than 100 mm/hour, there is a 90% probability that an underlying cause would be found upon investigation.

===Non-inflammatory conditions===
In non-inflammatory conditions, plasma albumin concentration, size, shape, and number of red blood cells, and the concentration of immunoglobulin can affect the ESR. Non-inflammatory conditions that can cause raised ESR include anemia, kidney failure, obesity, ageing, and female sex. ESR is also higher in women during menstruation and pregnancy. The value of ESR does not change whether dialysis is performed or not. Therefore, ESR is not a reliable measure of inflammation in those with kidney injuries as the ESR value is already elevated.

==Causes of reduction==
An increased number of red blood cells (polycythemia) causes reduced ESR as blood viscosity increases. Hemoglobinopathy such as sickle-cell disease can have low ESR due to an improper shape of red blood cells that impairs stacking.

==Medical uses==
===Diagnosis===
ESR can sometimes be useful in diagnosing diseases, such as multiple myeloma, temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, various autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and chronic kidney diseases. In many of these cases, the ESR may exceed 100 mm/hour.

It is commonly used for a differential diagnosis for Kawasaki&#x27;s disease (from Takayasu&#x27;s arteritis; which would have a markedly elevated ESR) and it may be increased in some chronic infective conditions like tuberculosis and infective endocarditis. It is also elevated in subacute thyroiditis also known as DeQuervain&#x27;s.

In markedly increased ESR of over 100 mm/h, infection is the most common cause (33% of cases in an American study), followed by cancer (17%), kidney disease (17%) and noninfectious inflammatory disorders (14%). Yet, in pneumonia the ESR stays under 100.

The usefulness of the ESR in current practice has been questioned by some, as it is a relatively imprecise and non-specific test compared to other available diagnostic tests. Current literature suggests that and ESR should be &quot;obtained on all patients over the age of 50&quot; who have an intense headache.

===Disease severity===
It is a component of the PCDAI (pediatric Crohn&#x27;s disease activity index), an index for assessment of the severity of inflammatory bowel disease in children.

===Monitoring response to therapy===
The clinical usefulness of ESR is limited to monitoring the response to therapy in certain inflammatory diseases such as temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used as a crude measure of response in Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. Additionally, ESR levels are used to define one of the several possible adverse prognostic factors in the staging of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

==Normal values==
&quot;Note: mm/h. = millimeters per hour.&quot;

Westergren&#x27;s original normal values (men 3 mm/h and women 7 mm/h) made no allowance for a person&#x27;s age. Later studies from 1967 confirmed that ESR values tend to rise with age and to be generally higher in women.
Values of the ESR also appear to be slightly higher in normal populations of African-Americans than Caucasians of both genders. Values also appear to be higher in anemic individuals than non-anemic individuals.

===Adults===
The widely used rule calculating normal maximum ESR values in adults (98% confidence limit) is given by a formula devised in 1983 from a study of ≈1000 individuals over the age of 20: The normal values of ESR in men is age (in years) divided by 2; for women, the normal value is age (in years) plus 10, divided by 2.
:formula_1

Other studies confirm a dependence of ESR on age and gender, as seen in the following:

ESR reference ranges from a large 1996 study of 3,910 healthy adults (NB. these use 95% confidence intervals rather than the 98% intervals used in the study used to derive the formula above, and because of the skewness of the data, these values appear to be less than expected from the above formula):
===Children===
Normal values of ESR have been quoted as 1 to 2 mm/h at birth, rising to 4 mm/h 8 days after delivery, and then to 17 mm/h by day 14.

Typical normal ranges quoted are:
* Newborn: 0 to 2 mm/h
* Neonatal to puberty: 3 to 13 mm/h, but other laboratories place an upper limit of 20.

==Relation to C-reactive protein==
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein. Therefore, it is a better marker for acute phase reaction than ESR. While ESR and CRP generally together correlate with the degree of inflammation, this is not always the case and results may be discordant in 12.5% of the cases. Cases with raised CRP but normal ESR may demonstrate a combination of infection and some other tissue damage such as myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism. Such inflammation may not be enough to raise the level of ESR. Those with high ESR usually do not have demonstrable inflammation. However, in cases of low grade bacterial infections of bone and joints such as coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ESR can be a good marker for the inflammatory process. This may be due to the production of Interferon type I that inhibits the CRP production in liver cells during SLE. CRP is a better marker for other autoimmune diseases such as polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, post-operative sepsis, and neonatal sepsis. ESR may be reduced in those who are taking statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

==History==
The test was invented in 1897 by the Polish pathologist Edmund Biernacki. In some parts of the world the test continues to be referred to as Biernacki&#x27;s Reaction ({{langx|pl|odczyn Biernackiego}}, OB). In 1918, Dr Robert Fåhræus noted that ESR differed only during pregnancy. Therefore, he suggested that ESR could be used as an indicator of pregnancy. In 1921, Dr Alf Vilhelm Albertsson Westergren used ESR to measure the disease outcome of tuberculosis. He defined the measurement standards of ESR which is still being used today. Robert Fåhræus and Alf Vilhelm Albertsson Westergren are eponymously remembered for the &#x27;Fahraeus-Westergren test&#x27; (abbreviated as FW test; in the UK, usually termed Westergren test), which uses sodium citrate-anti-coagulated specimens.

==Research==
According to a study released in 2015, a stop gain mutation in &quot;HBB&quot; gene (p. Gln40stop) was shown to be associated with ESR values in Sardinian population. The red blood cell count, whose values are inversely related to ESR, is affected in carriers of this SNP. This mutation is almost exclusive of the inhabitants of Sardinia and is a common cause of beta thalassemia.

According to a 2010 study, there is a reverse correlation between ESR and general intelligence (IQ) in Swedish males aged 18–20.

<text>X Clan (formerly stylized as XCLAN and often incorrectly spelled X-Clan) is a hip hop group from Brooklyn, New York, originally consisting of Grand Verbalizer Funkin&#x27; Lesson Brother J, Professor X the Overseer, Paradise the Architect, and Sugar Shaft the Rhythm Provider. The current incarnation of the group features leader Brother J, Master China, Kumu, &quot;Ultraman&quot; Ra Hanna, ACL, Lord Cza, DJ Fat Jack and Zulu.

==Biography==
Known for its Afrocentrism and militant activism as member of the Blackwatch movement, X Clan soon gained fame for the controversy its music aroused, though commercial success was sporadic. X Clan&#x27;s debut was &quot;To the East, Blackwards&quot; (1990), followed by &quot;Xodus&quot; (1992) and a temporary break-up. Both albums peaked at #11 on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in the United States.

<text>Cam&#x27;ron Giles (born February 4, 1976), known mononymously as Cam&#x27;ron, is an American rapper. Beginning his career in the early 1990s as Killa Cam, Giles signed with Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera&#x27;s Untertainment, an imprint of Epic Records to release his first two studio albums &quot;Confessions of Fire&quot; (1998) and &quot;S.D.E. (Sports Drugs &amp; Entertainment)&quot; (2000); the former received gold certification by the RIAA. After leaving Epic, Giles signed with Roc-A-Fella Records in 2001 to release his third studio album, &quot;Come Home with Me&quot;, the following year. It received platinum certification by the RIAA and spawned the singles &quot;Oh Boy&quot; (featuring Juelz Santana) and &quot;Hey Ma&quot; (featuring Juelz Santana, Freekey Zekey and Toya), which peaked at numbers four and three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. His fourth studio album, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (2004) was met with similar success and likewise received gold certification by the RIAA.

Due to personal disagreements with Jay-Z, Giles and his label parted ways with Roc-A-Fella in 2005 in favor of Asylum Records. In 2006, Giles released his fifth studio album &quot;Killa Season&quot;, accompanied by a film of the same name in which Giles starred and made his director-screenwriter debut. In 2009, after taking a hiatus due to his mother&#x27;s health, Giles returned to music and released his sixth studio album &quot;Crime Pays&quot; (2009), which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A decade later, he released his seventh album, &quot;Purple Haze 2&quot; (2019), which narrowly entered the chart.

Aside from his solo career, Giles formed the short-lived hip hop group Children of the Corn alongside Big L and Mase in 1993; they disbanded in 1997. He subsequently formed the hip hop collective the Diplomats (also known as Dipset) in the latter year, alongside his longtime affiliate Jim Jones and cousin Freekey Zekey. He later performed as one half of the duo U.N. (Us Now) with fellow Harlem native Vado; the duo released two collaborative projects. In addition to the &quot;Killa Season&quot; film, Giles has acted in other works including the Roc-A-Fella films &quot;Paper Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Paid in Full&quot; in 2002.

==Biography==

===1976–1997: Early life and career beginnings===
Giles was born and raised in the East Harlem neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, New York City. He was raised by his mother, Fredericka Giles (July 10, 1955 – February 9, 2023). He went to school at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, where he met his longtime friends Mase and Jim Jones. He was a promising basketball player alongside Mase; however, he was unable to take advantage of scholarship offers due to his poor academic standing. Instead, he enrolled in a college in Texas, without even graduating from high school, but was expelled and returned to Harlem where he began selling drugs before starting his rap career. Giles was eventually introduced to The Notorious B.I.G. through his childhood friend Mase. B.I.G. introduced Giles to Lance Rivera, who signed him to his label, Untertainment.

He began his musical career in the mid-1990s, rapping alongside Big L, Mase, and his cousin Bloodshed, in a group called Children of the Corn. After Bloodshed&#x27;s death in a car accident on March 2, 1997, the group disbanded and the remaining members pursued solo careers.

===1998–2002: &quot;Confessions of Fire&quot;, &quot;S.D.E.&quot; and &quot;Come Home with Me&quot;===
Two years before Big L&#x27;s murder in 1999, Cam&#x27;ron was introduced to The Notorious B.I.G. by Mase who was signed to Bad Boy Records at the time. Biggie was so impressed by Cam&#x27;ron that he introduced him to his partner Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera who signed Cam&#x27;ron to his Untertainment label, distributed by Epic Records. His debut album, &quot;Confessions of Fire&quot;, was released a year later in July 1998 and included singles such as &quot;3-5-7&quot; (which was also featured in the movie Woo), and &quot;Horse and Carriage&quot; featuring Mase, which reached the R&amp;B Top Ten. The album achieved gold status and made the Top 10 of both the pop and R&amp;B charts.

In 2000, Cam&#x27;ron was working with music executive Tommy Mottola and released his second album &quot;S.D.E. (Sports Drugs &amp; Entertainment)&quot; on Sony/Epic Records. With features from Destiny&#x27;s Child, Juelz Santana, Jim Jones, N.O.R.E., and producer Digga, it included the relatively successful singles, &quot;Let Me Know&quot; and &quot;What Means The World To You&quot;. The album reached Number 2 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and Number 14 on the Billboard 200.

After demanding a release from Sony/Epic Records, Cam&#x27;ron signed with his childhood friend and new manager Damon Dash to Roc-A-Fella Records in December 2001, alongside artists such as Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, Freeway and Memphis Bleek. A reported $4.5 million record deal was agreed upon with Damon Dash and his Roc-A-Fella partners Kareem Biggs and Jay-Z in the form of a record advance. His third and most successful album &quot;Come Home with Me&quot; was released in 2002 featuring guests such as Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek, and production from Just Blaze, Kanye West and The Heatmakerz. It included the hit singles &quot;Oh Boy&quot; and &quot;Hey Ma&quot;, which both featured the Diplomats newest member Juelz Santana. The album achieved platinum status and served as a stepping stone for Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s group the Diplomats to sign with Roc-A-Fella.

In 2002, Cam&#x27;ron went on to appear in the Damon Dash produced film, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, in which he played one of three main characters alongside Mekhi Phifer and Wood Harris. In 2006 he started shooting his movie for his album titled &quot;Killa Season&quot;; the film would mark both Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s screenwriting and directorial debuts, as well as his return to acting. Killa Season was released to DVD on April 25, 2006, after a special two-day theatrical release.

===2003–2009: &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Killa Season&quot; and &quot;Crime Pays&quot;===
In March 2003, Cam&#x27;ron teamed up with his fellow Diplomats Members Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Freekey Zeeky to release the Diplomats&#x27; debut double disc album, &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;, under Roc-A-Fella/Diplomat Records, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. The album featured the lead single &quot;Dipset Anthem&quot;, a remix to Cam&#x27;rons hit &quot;Hey Ma&quot;, and the (street anthem) single &quot;I Really Mean It&quot;, as well as featuring production from Kanye West, Just Blaze, and The Heatmakerz. A year later, the Diplomats released their second album, &quot;Diplomatic Immunity 2&quot;.

On December 7, 2004, Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, was released on Def Jam/Roc-A-Fella Records. It featured collaborations with Kanye West, Jaheim, Twista, Juelz Santana, and various other artists and ultimately reached gold status. The album was also a critical success, being ranked 114th on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Top 200 Albums of the first decade of the 21st century List, and 10th on Rhapsody&#x27;s Hip Hop&#x27;s Best Albums Of The Decade List. However, after feeling that the album was poorly promoted and that his projects were not receiving enough attention, Cam&#x27;ron requested his release from Roc-A-Fella Records.

On April 28, 2005, Cam&#x27;ron officially joined the Warner Music Group under the Asylum Records imprint. He began work on what would be his first project for the new label. Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s fifth studio album, titled &quot;Killa Season&quot;, was released on May 16, 2006, featuring production from long-term collaborators The Heatmakerz, Charlmagne and Ty Fyffe, as well as others such as Alchemist and I.N.F.O. Along with the album, Cam&#x27;ron released his first film, in which he wrote, directed and starred in, also titled &quot;Killa Season&quot;. Despite selling 112,000 units in the first week and debuting at number 2 on the charts, &quot;Killa Season&quot; failed to have the same sales strength as his two previous releases, but &quot;Killa Season&quot; became certified gold.

After the release of &quot;Killa Season&quot; and his feud with 50 Cent in 2007, Cam&#x27;ron took a three-year hiatus from music after his mother suffered three strokes which left her paralyzed on her left side. He moved to Florida with her to set up her rehabilitation and therapy, and stayed there until she had fully recovered. Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s 2009 album, &quot;Crime Pays&quot; was released on Asylum/Diplomat Records, featuring the majority of the production handled by Skitzo and AraabMuzik. Although none of the singles from the album managed to chart, the album still reached number 3 on the Billboard 200 but only sold 150,000 units, making it the lowest selling album of his career. In 2009 Cam&#x27;ron formed a new label, Dipset West and new group the U.N.

After three years Cam&#x27;ron and Jim Jones decided to mend their differences and start working together again for the third installment of the &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; album along with fellow Diplomat members Juelz Santana and Freekey Zekey. Cam&#x27;ron announced that The Diplomats album&#x27;s release would take place around Christmas 2010.

==Feuds==

===Jay-Z===
Although there had been rumors of a feud between the two emcees, Cam&#x27;ron went public first with a track on &quot;Killa Season&quot; called &quot;You Gotta Love It (Jay-Z Diss)&quot; featuring ex-Dipset member Max B. In the song, Cam&#x27;ron takes jabs at Jay-Z&#x27;s age, his alleged &quot;biting&quot; (stealing) of lyrics, and his current girlfriend. He references Jay-Z using The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s rhymes, rapping &quot;You ain&#x27;t the only one with big wallets got it my shit&#x27;s brolick but ya publishing should go to Miss Wallace.&quot; He then released another song &quot;Swagger Jacker (Biter Not a Writer)&quot; to highlight the many songs Jay-Z has borrowed lines from. In the next issue of XXL, Cam&#x27;ron explained the beef originated when Jay-Z became CEO and President of Roc-A-Fella Records. In 2010, Cam&#x27;ron stated he does not have any issues with Jay-Z anymore.

In 2013, on &quot;Pound Cake&quot;, a song by Drake, Jay-Z mentioned Cam&#x27;ron again by rapping (in the middle of a verse): &quot;Now here&#x27;s the icing on the cake/ Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh/ I&#x27;m just getting started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch/ I&#x27;ve done made more millionaires than the lotto did/ Dame made millions, Bigg made millions/ Ye made millions, Just made millions/ Lyor made millions, Cam made millions/ Beans would tell you if he wasn&#x27;t in his feelin[g]s.&quot;

Cam replied briefly on &quot;Come and Talk to Me&quot; off of &quot;Ghetto Heaven Vol. 1&quot;: &quot;She said Jay made you a millionaire? and looked me in the eyes/ Said cake, cake, cake, got that from the pies/ We made each other millions, that was my reply/ had a mill before I met him, baby, that ain&#x27;t no lie/ See he named some Harlem cats and the homie from the Chi / but my thing, he ain&#x27;t name nobody from the Stuy&quot;.

On April 26, 2019, he and Jay-Z ended their feud at the re-opened Webster Hall.

===50 Cent===
On February 1, 2007, Cam&#x27;ron and 50 Cent had a live argument on &quot;The Angie Martinez Show&quot; on Hot 97 radio. 50 Cent commented that he felt Koch Entertainment was a &quot;graveyard&quot;, meaning major record labels would not work with their artists. Cam&#x27;ron then ridiculed the record sales of G-Unit members Lloyd Banks and Mobb Deep by pointing out that Dipset member Jim Jones outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels. Both rappers released diss songs with videos on YouTube. 50 Cent released &quot;Funeral Music&quot;, and suggested in the song that Cam&#x27;ron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Cam&#x27;ron responded with &quot;Curtis&quot; and &quot;Curtis Pt. II&quot;, in which he makes fun of 50 Cent&#x27;s appearance, calling him &quot;a gorilla, with rabbit teeth&quot;. 50 Cent responded by releasing &quot;Hold On&quot; with Young Buck. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.

===Jim Jones===
Cam&#x27;ron revealed in 2007 that he was no longer speaking to his fellow Diplomat members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, leading to speculation that the group had officially broken up. However, despite admitting that he did not want to contact Jim Jones, he said that he had no hard feelings towards him. In an interview with Miss Info, Cam&#x27;ron said: &quot;I still haven&#x27;t spoken to Jim. But Jim ran with me for over 10 years, he worked hard, and I wish him the best of luck. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m mad at Jim. Why am I mad? I told people for years that Jimmy was gonna be a star. So it&#x27;s better on my resume. I wish him the best.&quot; After three years of not speaking, Cam&#x27;ron and Jim Jones mended their differences in April 2010. In late 2011, both appeared together on Wolfgang Gartner&#x27;s album &quot;Weekend in America&quot;, on the track &quot;Circus Freaks&quot;.

===Kanye West===
Both Cam&#x27;ron and Jim Jones took out their frustrations on former label-mate Kanye West in defense of former CEO Dame Dash (due to their longtime friendship dating back to growing up in Harlem) by releasing a song titled &quot;Toast&quot; rhyming over Kanye West&#x27;s song &quot;Runaway&quot;. The feud eventually ended, evidenced by Cam&#x27;ron, Jim Jones, and Kanye West collaborating on a song called &quot;Christmas in Harlem&quot;.

==Personal life==
On October 23, 2005, Cam&#x27;ron was leaving a nightclub in Washington, D.C., having performed the day before at Howard University. While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of New York and New Jersey Avenues shortly after midnight, a passenger of a nearby car threatened Cam&#x27;ron to &quot;give up&quot; his 2006 Lamborghini. Cam&#x27;ron resisted, and the man then shot him. Cam&#x27;ron was struck at least once as he was holding the steering wheel, but he was able to drive, going the wrong way on streets and flashing his lights, until a fan drove him to Howard University Hospital. The gunman and passenger drove off, crashed into a parked car, and fled the scene. D.C. Metro Police recovered a cell phone from the scene of the crash, which they tried to use to trace the suspects. He stated that he does not know who shot him, although later, in the song &quot;Gotta Love It&quot; featuring Max B, Cam&#x27;ron claims that he saw the gunman throw up the Roc-A-Fella Records diamond hand signal before shots were fired.

On April 22, 2007, Cam&#x27;ron was interviewed on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; as part of a piece on the Stop Snitchin&#x27; movement. He stated that he would &quot;not help the police&quot; try to locate a potential shooter, saying he is &quot;not a snitch&quot; and helping the police would probably hurt his record sales, adding &quot;It&#x27;s about business but it&#x27;s still also a code of ethics.&quot; When asked by Anderson Cooper if he would tell the police if a serial killer was living next to him, Cam&#x27;ron replied &quot;I would probably move&quot; but would not inform the police. He later apologized, calling it an &quot;error in judgement&quot;: &quot;Where I come from, once word gets out that you&#x27;ve cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I&#x27;m not saying its right, but its reality.&quot; Cam&#x27;ron has had contact with the police in the past. According to The Smoking Gun, New York Police Department records indicate that Giles filed a report with police after he was assaulted at a park in Harlem in 1999.

<text>Zoe Porphyrogenita (also spelled Zoë; , &quot;life&quot;; 978 – 1050) was a member of the Macedonian dynasty who briefly reigned as Byzantine empress in 1042, alongside her sister Theodora. Before that she was enthroned as empress consort or empress mother to a series of co-rulers, two of whom were married to her.

Zoe was born when her father Constantine was nominal co-emperor to his brother, Basil II. After a planned marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Otto III in 996 failed to materialise, Zoe spent subsequent years in the imperial palace. Her uncle Basil died in 1025 when Zoe was 47, and her father acceded the Byzantine throne as Constantine VIII. As he had no sons, Constantine hoped to continue the dynasty by marrying off one of his daughters. Zoe, aged 50, was married to Romanos Argyros. She and Romanos took the throne the next day on her father&#x27;s death.

Zoe&#x27;s marriage to Romanos III was troubled, and Romanos was found dead in his bath in 1034. His death has been variously attributed to Zoe, her lover Michael, or both. Zoe and Michael were married on the same day as the supposed murder, and he was crowned Emperor Michael IV on the following day. In 1041, Zoe was persuaded to adopt her dying husband&#x27;s nephew, Michael Kalaphates. Once Michael V became emperor, he promptly exiled Zoe. This action sparked a popular revolt which dethroned him and installed Zoe and her sister Theodora as joint empresses. After a two-month joint reign, Zoe married a former lover who was installed as Constantine IX, transferring power to him. However, she continued to rule the empire as its heir and as the Byzantine empress. Eight years later, Zoe died aged 72. Her reign saw the decline of the Roman army, and the first incursions by the Turks into eastern Anatolia.

==Early life: 978–1028==

Zoe was &quot;Porphyrogenita&quot;, &quot;born into the purple&quot;; this was the appellation for a child born in the capital to a reigning emperor. She was the second daughter of Constantine VIII and his wife Helena. Her father had become co-emperor, at the age of two, in 962. His brother Basil II, the senior co-ruler, prevented his nieces from marrying any of the Byzantine nobility, as this would have given their husbands a claim on the imperial throne. As women they were unable to exercise any state authority; their only say in this was in choosing, or more likely accepting or not, a husband who would acquire their authority upon marriage. Consequently, Zoe lived a life of virtual obscurity in the imperial &quot;gynaeceum&quot; (women&#x27;s quarters) for many years.

As an eligible imperial princess Zoe was considered a possible bride for the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto III, in 996. A second embassy sent in 1001, headed by Arnulf II, Archbishop of Milan, was tasked with selecting Otto&#x27;s bride from among Constantine&#x27;s three daughters. The eldest, Eudocia, was disfigured by smallpox, while the youngest, Theodora, was a very plain girl. Arnulf, therefore, selected the attractive 23-year-old Zoe, to which Basil II agreed. In January 1002 she accompanied Arnulf back to Italy, only to discover when the ship reached Bari that Otto had died, forcing her to return home.

When Basil II died, Constantine VIII took the throne. His reign as sole emperor lasted less than three years, from 15 December 1025 to 11 November 1028. Another opportunity for Zoe to marry arose in 1028 when an embassy from the Holy Roman Empire arrived in Constantinople with a proposal for an imperial marriage. Constantine and Zoe rejected the idea out of hand when it was revealed that the intended groom, Henry, the son of Conrad II, was only ten years old. Constantine determined that the ruling house would be continued by one of his daughters being married to an appropriate aristocrat. The first potential match was the distinguished noble Constantine Dalassenos, the former &quot;dux&quot; of Antioch. The emperor&#x27;s advisors preferred a weak ruler whom they could control and they persuaded him to reject Dalassenos after he had already been summoned to the capital. Romanos Argyros, the urban prefect of Constantinople, was the next to be considered as a match. Theodora defied her father by refusing to marry Romanos, arguing that he was already marriedhis wife having been forced to become a nun to allow Romanos to marry into the imperial familyand that as third cousins they had too close a blood relationship for marriage to occur. Consequently, Constantine VIII chose Zoe to be Romanos&#x27;s wife. Zoe and Romanos married on 10 November 1028 in the imperial chapel of the palace. The next day Constantine died and the newlyweds were seated on the imperial throne.

==From Romanos III to Michael V: 1028–1042==

Spending years in the same restrictive quarters with her sister, Zoe had come to loathe Theodora. Zoe convinced Romanos to appoint one of his own men as the chief of Theodora&#x27;s household, with orders to spy on her. Shortly afterwards, Theodora was accused of plotting to usurp the throne, first with Presian in 1030, followed by Constantine Diogenes, the governor of Sirmium, in 1031. Zoe accused her of being part of the conspiracy, and Theodora was forcibly confined in the monastery of Petrion. Zoe later visited her sister and forced her to take religious vows.

Zoe was obsessed with continuing the Macedonian dynasty. Almost immediately upon marrying Romanos the fifty-year-old Zoe tried desperately to become pregnant. She used magic charms, amulets, and potions, all without effect. This failure to conceive helped alienate the couple, and soon Romanos refused to share the marriage bed with her. Romanos limited his wife&#x27;s spending and paid her little attention.

Zoe, furious and frustrated, engaged in a number of affairs. Romanos tolerated these and took a mistress himself. In 1033 Zoe became enamoured of a low-born servant called Michael. She flaunted her lover openly and spoke about making him emperor. Rumours of her conduct led Romanos to confront Michael, who denied aspiring to the throne.

In early 1034 Romanos became ill and it was widely believed that Zoe and Michael were conspiring to have him poisoned. On 11 April Romanos was found dying in his bath. According to court official and later chronicler Michael Psellus some of his retinue had &quot;held his head for a long time beneath the water, attempting at the same time to strangle him&quot;. John Scylitzes writes as a simple fact that Romanos was drowned on Michael&#x27;s orders. Matthew of Edessa&#x27;s account has Zoe poisoning Romanos.

Zoe and Michael were married on the same day that Romanos III died. The next day they summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate at the coronation of the new emperor. Although he initially refused to co-operate, the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. Zoe&#x27;s new husband took power as Michael IV. His abrupt rise to power had left him unprepared to rule, and he delegated much of the business of governing to his brother, the eunuch John the Orphanotrophos.

Although Zoe believed Michael would prove to be a more devoted husband than Romanos, she was mistaken. Fearing that Zoe would turn on him as she had turned on his predecessor, Michael excluded her from politics and sent her back to the &quot;gynaeceum&quot;, where she was kept under strict surveillance. The disgruntled empress tried to alter the balance of power by conspiring against John, without success.

Michael&#x27;s health was bad throughout his reign, and by 1041 it was obvious that he was dying. Eager to ensure that power remained in his hands, John the Eunuch forced Zoe to adopt his nephew Michael Kalaphates. On 10 December 1041, Michael IV died, refusing to the last to see his wife who begged that she be allowed to visit him one more time. Kalaphates was crowned emperor as Michael V.
Although he had pledged to respect Zoe, Michael V promptly banished her to a monastery on Principus, an island in the Sea of Marmara, on charges of attempted regicide. She was forcibly tonsured and sworn into a religious order. This treatment of the legitimate heir to the Macedonian Dynasty caused a popular uprising in Constantinople. Michael V, desperate to keep his throne, brought Zoe back from Principus and displayed her to the people, but his insistence that he continue to rule alongside her was in vain. On 19 April 1042, the mob revolted against Michael V in support of not only Zoe but also Theodora.

A delegation headed by Patrician Constantine Cabasilas went to the monastery at Petrion to convince Theodora to become co-empress alongside her sister. Theodora had become accustomed to a life of religious contemplation and tried to refuse the proposal, but the delegates brought her forcibly back to the capital. At an assembly in Hagia Sophia the people escorted a furious Theodora and proclaimed her empress along with Zoe. They were both crowned on 21 April and Michael V was forced to take refuge in a monastery.

==Ruling with Theodora and Constantine IX: 1042–1050==
Zoe immediately assumed power and tried to force Theodora back to her monastery, but the Senate and the people demanded that the sisters should jointly reign. As her first act Theodora was called upon to deal with Michael V. Zoe wanted to pardon and free Michael, but Theodora was clear and adamant. She initially guaranteed Michael&#x27;s safety, but then ordered him to be blinded and to spend the rest of his life as a monk.
Officially Zoe was the senior empress, and her throne was situated slightly in front of Theodora&#x27;s on all public occasions. In practice Theodora was the driving force behind the joint administration. The sisters proceeded to administer the empire, focusing on curbing the sale of public offices and on the administration of justice. Although contemporary historian Michael Psellus claimed the joint reign was a complete failure, John Scylitzes stated that they were very conscientious in rectifying the abuses of the previous reigns.

Theodora and Zoe appeared together at meetings of the Senate and gave public audiences, but it was soon apparent that their joint reign was under strain. Zoe was still jealous of Theodora and had no desire to administer the empire; but she would not allow Theodora to conduct public business alone. The court began to split, with factions forming behind each empress. After two months of increasing acrimony, Zoe decided to search for a new husbandthereby denying Theodora the opportunity to increase her influence. By the rules of the Orthodox Church her next marriage, her third, was the last she was permitted.
Her preference was for Constantine Dalassenos, who had been her father&#x27;s first choice as her husband back in 1028. He was brought for an audience before the Empress, but during their conversation his independent and forceful manner displeased Zoe, and he was dismissed from her presence. Her next choice was the married Constantine Atroklines, a court official with whom it was rumoured that she had had an affair during the reign of Romanos III. He died under mysterious circumstances a few days before the wedding was to take place, possibly poisoned by his own soon to be ex-wife.

Zoe then remembered the handsome and urbane Constantine Monomachos, another former lover. The pair were married on 11 June 1042, without the participation of Patriarch Alexios, who refused to officiate over a third marriage (for both spouses). Constantine was crowned by the patriarch the next day.

Zoe got more than she bargained for when Constantine decided to bring with him to his new station his long-standing mistress Maria Skleraina. Not content with bringing her to court, he insisted that he be allowed to publicly share his life with her, and that she obtain some official recognition. The 64-year-old Zoe did not object to sharing her bed and her throne with Skleraina. Skleraina was given the title of &quot;sebaste&quot;, ranking behind Zoe and Theodora, and was addressed as mistress or empress, like them. At official events Skleraina took position immediately behind the sisters.

In the eyes of the public, however, Constantine IX&#x27;s preferential treatment of Skleraina was a scandal, and eventually rumours began to spread that Skleraina was planning to murder Zoe, and possibly Theodora. This led to a popular uprising by the citizens of Constantinople in 1044, which came dangerously close to actually harming Constantine, who was participating in a religious procession along the streets of Constantinople. The mob was only quieted by the appearance on a balcony of Zoe and Theodora, who reassured the people that they were not in any danger of assassination.

It is said that Zoe was stunningly beautiful, and Michael Psellos in his &quot;Chronographia&quot; commented that &quot;every part of her was firm and in good condition&quot;. Recognising her own beauty and its use as a tool of statecraft, Zoe attempted to maximise and prolong its effect with a variety of treatments. She operated a cosmetics laboratory in the &quot;gynaeceum&quot;, and was said to have carried out experiments to improve the efficacy of the perfumes and unguents prepared there. Psellus reports that her face looked youthful into her sixties. Zoe died in 1050, aged 72. She was buried in Constantinople.

<text>The Islands District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. It is part of the New Territories. It had a population of 185,282 in 2021.

Hong Kong consists of a peninsula and 263 islands. The Islands District consists of some twenty large and small islands which lie to the south and southwest of Hong Kong. Notable areas that are part of the Islands District include Chek Lap Kok, the reclaimed island on which Hong Kong International Airport is located, Tung Chung on northern Lantau near the airport, and Discovery Bay, a large private residential area on eastern Lantau.

==Islands of Hong Kong==
Many islands of Hong Kong are actually not part of the district. Most notably, Hong Kong Island contains four districts itself. The term &quot;Outlying Islands&quot; tends to refer to the islands of the Islands District. The northeast point of Lantau and Ma Wan traditionally belong to Tsuen Wan District owing to their administration and transport dependence of Tsuen Wan. Tsing Yi Island once was administered by Tsuen Wan District (1982 to 1985) and now by Kwai Tsing District. Whilst the Sai Kung Islands are part of the Sai Kung District, and the Tolo Channel islands part of Tai Po District.

==Demographics==
With an area that is 16% of Hong Kong and a population that is 2% of Hong Kong, the Islands District is the largest in terms of area and also the least populated. It is therefore the district with by far the lowest population density of . The outlying islands are notable for a more relaxed way of life than that of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula. The district has the third-youngest residents.

Collectively, Mui Wo and Tai O on Lantau, Cheung Chau, Lamma Island and Peng Chau are more populated than the rest of the area of the district.

As of 2021, the district has a population of 185,282. 78.1% of the population are Chinese. Ethnic minority groups include White (5.8%) and Filipino (5.3%).

==Transport==
Most of the islands in the Islands District have ferry services linking them with each other and the remainder of the territory, along with Macau and nearby cities in the Pearl Delta, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Public ferry piers are located at Tai O (Wing Hong Street, Shek Tsai Po), Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Cheung Chau Wan, Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay), Lamma Island (Yung Shue Wan, Sok Kwu Wan), Discovery Bay, Chi Ma Wan, and Peng Chau.

However, only Lantau Island has a fixed link to the New Territories and the rest of Hong Kong. This is via the North Lantau Highway and the Lantau Link, part of the Airport Core Programme completed in 1998. Most recently, since 2018, Lantau is the location of the Hong Kong port of entry for the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge.

Lantau is also the only island in the Islands District with a well-developed public transport network on land. It has the only MTR stations within the district; they are Tung Chung on the Tung Chung line and two on the Airport Express serving the airport and AsiaWorld Expo (Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort on the Disneyland Resort line administratively lie in Tsuen Wan District). Finally, Lantau is the only island with franchised taxis and buses, the latter mainly provided by New Lantao Bus (although other operators serve the northern shore, the airport, Disneyland, and Discovery Bay).
