<text>William Nicholas Vander Zalm (born Wilhelmus Nicholaas Theodore Marie van der Zalm; May 29, 1934) is a Dutch-born Canadian businessman and politician who served as the 28th premier of British Columbia and leader of the British Columbia Social Credit Party from 1986 to 1991. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of British Columbia, representing the riding of Surrey from 1975 to 1983, and the riding of Richmond from 1986 to 1991.

==Early life==
Wilhelmus Nicholaas Theodore Marie van der Zalm was born and raised in Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands. He emigrated to Canada after World War II, settling in the Fraser Valley in 1947. After completing high school, he sold tulip bulbs and ultimately established himself in the gardening business. He moved to Surrey after marrying Lillian Mihalic, and purchased a nursery.

==Early political career==
Vander Zalm was elected an alderman of Surrey in 1965, and served as the municipality&#x27;s mayor from 1969 to 1975. His tenure was marked by his crackdown on welfare recipients (until the early 1970s, welfare in BC was a municipal responsibility).

He was originally a supporter of both the Liberal Party of Canada and the BC Liberal Party. He sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1968 federal election as a Liberal in Surrey, but lost by 4,445 votes to New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Barry Mather. He was a candidate at the 1972 provincial Liberal leadership convention, where he lost to David Anderson. He subsequently ran in the Surrey constituency for the Liberal Party in the 1972 provincial election, but lost to incumbent BC New Democratic Party candidate Ernest Hall.

==Social Credit MLA==
Vander Zalm joined the BC Social Credit Party (Socred) in 1974, and was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 1975 election for the riding of Surrey. The Socreds won back power after a three-year hiatus, and Vander Zalm served in the cabinet of Premier Bill Bennett as minister of human resources from 1975 to 1978, where he continued his crusade against welfare fraud.

On June 22, 1978, the &quot;Victoria Daily Times&quot; published a political cartoon by Bob Bierman that portrayed the Minister of Human Resources as a grinning sadist, deliberately pulling the wings off flies. Vander Zalm launched legal action for libel, &quot;Vander Zalm v. Times Publishers&quot;. Justice Craig Munroe of the BC Supreme Court awarded Vander Zalm $3,500 in damages. The decision was overturned by the BC Court of Appeal in 1980, which was praised by journalists as a victory for free speech. The original cartoon was purchased by the National Archives of Canada for $350.

Vander Zalm was re-assigned as Minister of Municipal Affairs in December 1978, and kept the portfolio after winning re-election in 1979, before becoming Minister of Education in August 1982. In 1983, he publicly called on the Smithers school board to suspend teacher Madeleine Sauve without pay. Sauve distributed, without the permission of either parents or the local school board, a questionnaire concerning &quot;mutual masturbation, oral sex, use of pornography and prostitution&quot; to a class of Grade 8 students in Smithers.

He declined to run in the May 1983 provincial election. In 1984, he bought Fantasy Garden World, a theme park in Richmond, British Columbia. The same year, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Vancouver as the candidate for the Non-Partisan Association. He lost to the incumbent Mike Harcourt, who was later the provincial NDP leader during most of Vander Zalm&#x27;s tenure as premier.

==Premier==

In 1986, Premier Bennett announced he was retiring. Vander Zalm attracted considerable attention as he considered whether he would run for the leadership of the Social Credit Party. He generated more press from the race than the other candidates did. At the party&#x27;s convention in Whistler, British Columbia, he prevailed over 11 other candidates (including future prime minister Kim Campbell) by winning on the fourth ballot, and was sworn in as premier on August 6, 1986.

During the 1986 provincial election campaign, &quot;Vandermania&quot; swept BC, and the Socreds easily won another term over the opposition BC NDP. Vander Zalm himself re-entered the legislature by winning one of the two seats in Richmond.

Vander Zalm promised a fresh start after the confrontational Bennett years, filling most of the cabinet slots with MLAs who had languished on the backbench under Bennett. He decided to release the normally secret list of cabinet appointments to two &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; reporters hours before the official announcement was to be made. Under his watch, the Socred government took a more social conservative hue. This did not sit well with more moderate Socreds, who began drifting to the previously moribund Liberals—a trend that would haunt Vander Zalm&#x27;s successors later.

On July 7, 1987, during the first session of the 34th Parliament, Vander Zalm&#x27;s health minister Peter Dueck introduced the Health Statutes Amendment Act (Bill 34). This bill specified quarantine procedures for individuals with “serious reportable communicable disease.&quot; The bill was met with serious backlash and protest from HIV/AIDS activism groups like ACT UP, the Vancouver Lesbian Connection, and the Vancouver Persons With AIDS Coalition. The mobilization by activists in protest of the bill led to the formation of the Coalition for Responsible Health Legislation (CRHL) by Vancouver-based AIDS activists that led several actions for protest, but also education like safer sex workshops focused on preventing HIV transmission. The bill received Royal Assent on December 17, 1987, and was passed into law. The protests continued, but effort from the BC Civil Liberties Association shifted to the modification of the bill, rather than discarding it completely.

The government of Premier Bill Vander Zalm refused to fund the 1990 Gay Games in Vancouver and cited inappropriate usage of public resources.

In 1988, after the Supreme Court of Canada decision of &quot;R v Morgentaler&quot;, the provinces were now expected to cover abortion. Vander Zalm chose not to extend provincial medical coverage to abortion by citing that abortions were an elective procedure and not medically necessary.

Vander Zalm became embroiled in an alleged conflict of interest controversy over the sale of his Fantasy Gardens flower garden and theme park. The conflict of interest arose because the Taiwanese buyer, Tan Yu, was provided VIP treatment by members of the Vander Zalm Government prior to the sale. Adding fuel to the fire, Faye Leung, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur and the woman who brokered the deal, claimed that Vander Zalm was a &quot;bad man&quot; since the day she first met him and secretly recorded conversations she had with him, which were subsequently leaked to the media. For her part in the affair, Leung would later be convicted of four counts of secret commissions over 100k, and one count of theft over 45k, and two counts of fraud in 1995 by the BC Court of Appeals.

Vander Zalm resigned in 1991 after a provincial conflict of interest report by Ted Hughes found that he had mixed private business with his public office in the sale of the Gardens. He was charged with criminal breach of trust, but was acquitted in BC Supreme Court in 1992. The judge ruled that Vander Zalm had acted in a manner that was &quot;foolish, ill-advised and in apparent or real conflict of interest or breach of ethics&quot;, but that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. It was revealed that during the sale of Fantasy Gardens, Vander Zalm had accepted $20,000 payment in cash from Tan Yu, the buyer of Fantasy Gardens, to which Vander Zalm said he took &quot;for innocent reasons relating to travel and expenses incurred.&quot;

Vander Zalm was succeeded as premier by Deputy Premier Rita Johnston, who defeated Grace McCarthy in the race to replace him as Socred leader. Contrary to popular belief that the party would thrive under new leadership, Social Credit collapsed to a distant third in the 1991 election, with the NDP returning to government and the Liberals becoming official opposition. The Social Credit Party were completely shut out of the legislature in the subsequent 1996 election and never again won seats.

== Later career ==

===Leadership of British Columbia Reform Party===
Vander Zalm returned to politics in November 1999 when he was acclaimed as leader of the Reform Party of British Columbia. Shortly after, he ran in a December 1999 provincial by-election in Delta South, but finished second with 32.91% of the vote behind BC Liberal Party candidate Val Roddick, who received 59.63%. The BC Green Party came in third place and the governing NDP finished in a distant fourth place with just 2.44%, their worst showing ever.

He attempted to orchestrate a merger of the Reform Party with other right-wing parties, but ran into stiff opposition. Vander Zalm and supporters within the party would later merge with several other small right-wing parties to form the British Columbia Unity Party. The Reform Party was de-registered as a BC political party in 2001 and Vander Zalm retired from politics. He now lives in Ladner.

===Successful campaign against HST===
Vander Zalm returned to the political spotlight in 2009, alongside Bill Tieleman, as a recurring critic of the provincial government&#x27;s conversion of the Provincial Sales Tax to the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). A series of populist rallies led to him becoming the official proponent, in accordance with the &quot;Recall and Initiative Act&quot;, of a petition seeking a referendum to cancel the HST. Vander Zalm established a website, FightHST, to promote the initiative. The provincial Liberal government countered Vander Zalm&#x27;s campaign and devoted a section of their website to the positive aspects of the HST.

For the petition to be certified, there was a requirement to secure the signatures of a minimum of 10% of all registered voters on the provincial voters list in each riding in the province, no later than June 30, 2010. On that date, Vander Zalm delivered 85 boxes containing 705,643 signatures from voters in every riding across the province. Those signatures represented some 45% of votes cast in the 2009 provincial election.

On August 11, 2010, Elections BC verified the official anti-HST petition submitted by the province&#x27;s Fight HST campaign. Vander Zalm said he was pleased with the result, but &quot;very disappointed&quot; to learn the province&#x27;s chief electoral officer would not act on the petition until all court proceedings involving the tax were complete. The anti-HST campaign turned its attention to a recall campaign for Liberal MLAs. Vander Zalm told reporters. &quot;We will recall every Liberal MLA in the province, if that&#x27;s what it takes.&quot; However, the initial attempts at recalls were unsuccessful.

On August 20, 2010, Chief Justice Robert J. Bauman ruled that the petition was valid. Bauman said Elections BC was correct when it approved the petition on August 11.

On September 14, 2010, it was announced a referendum would be held September 24, 2011 on repealing the HST. Premier Gordon Campbell stated a simple majority (50%+1) of those eligible and casting ballots would be sufficient for the government to cancel the HST if the referendum went against the government.

The 2011 British Columbia sales tax referendum was conducted by Elections BC via mail-in ballot throughout June and July 2011. The question on the ballot was: &quot;Are you in favour of extinguishing the HST (Harmonized Sales Tax) and reinstating the PST (Provincial Sales Tax) in conjunction with the GST (Goods and Services Tax)? Yes or No&quot; 

On August 26, 2011, Elections BC revealed the results of the referendum: 55% of 1.6 million voters in favour of abolishing the HST. The BC Liberals revealed a plan to re-instate the GST/PST system within 18 months, with a target date of March 31, 2013.

===2012 defamation suit===
In 2012, a BC Supreme Court judge and jury heard a defamation lawsuit lodged against Vander Zalm by retired conflict-of-interest commissioner Ted Hughes. The former judge alleged that he had been defamed in Vander Zalm&#x27;s 2008 self-published autobiography, &quot;For The People&quot;. The book suggested that Hughes, then in an interim appointment, may have conducted an unfair inquiry of Vander Zalm in 1991 by the prospect of achieving a permanent employment.

Vander Zalm defended the statements about Hughes, saying they had been fair comments, not facts, and that they had been made as a matter of public interest. Vander Zalm was found liable and ordered to pay $60,000 in damages, with Hughes to pay his own costs.

<text>Rita Margaret Johnston (born April 22, 1935; née Leichert) is a Canadian politician in British Columbia. Johnston became the first female premier in Canadian history when she succeeded Bill Vander Zalm in 1991 to become the 29th premier of British Columbia, serving for seven months.

The daughter of John Leichert and Annie Chyzzy, she was educated in Vancouver. In 1951, she married George Johnston.

Much of her early life was spent running a trailer park in the city of Surrey, British Columbia.

==Political career==

Johnston first entered politics as a city councillor in Surrey. In 1983, she was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as part of the Social Credit Party, representing the provincial riding of Surrey.

She was reelected in 1986 in the newly created riding of Surrey-Newton and became a cabinet minister under Premier Bill Vander Zalm, serving in various portfolios. She had previously served under Vander Zalm when she was a councilor and he was the mayor of Surrey.

Vander Zalm appointed Johnston deputy premier in 1990. When Vander Zalm resigned, on April 2, 1991, caucus selected her as interim leader over attorney general Russell Fraser by a vote of 21–17. As such, she was appointed premier on April 2, 1991, making her Canada&#x27;s first female first minister.

At a Social Credit party convention in July 1991, she was formally elected leader of the Socreds in an upset, narrowly defeating the frontrunner Grace McCarthy. However, she had little time to implement any new programs since she faced a statutory general election later that year.

Johnston waited as long as she could, finally calling an election for October. However, her long association with the scandal-plagued Vander Zalm hampered her chances of winning in her own right. Her party was also bitterly divided because of the leadership contest, and she had little time to repair the breach before the writs were dropped.

The Socreds were heavily defeated by New Democratic Party, led by Mike Harcourt. Moreover, many moderate Socreds switched their support to the previously moribund BC Liberals. The Socreds lost more than half of their popular vote from 1986 and were cut down to seven seats, falling to third place in the Legislative Assembly behind the NDP and Liberals.

Johnston herself lost her own seat to the NDP&#x27;s Penny Priddy by over 10 points, and all but seven members of her cabinet were defeated. Harcourt later said that he preferred facing Johnston rather than McCarthy, believing McCarthy would have been a tougher opponent in a general election.

Johnston resigned as leader of the Social Credit Party on January 11, 1992, and was replaced by McCarthy. After her defeat, Johnston retired from politics and has had a low public profile.

She returned to public life in 2009 as an advisor for the British Columbia Conservative Party.

<text>The Islamic National Army (, ), also referred to as the Islamic Emirate Army and the Afghan Army, is the land force branch of the Afghan Armed Forces. The roots of an army in Afghanistan can be traced back to the early 18th century when the Hotak dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s rise to power. It was reorganized in 1880 during Emir Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s reign. Afghanistan remained neutral during the First and Second World Wars. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Afghan Army was equipped by the Soviet Union.

After the resignation of President Najibullah in 1992, the army effectively dissolved. In 1996 the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban regime) took power, creating their own army, which lasted until the United States invasion of Afghanistan in October–November 2001.

By 2016, most of Afghanistan came under government control. However over the next few years the government slowly lost territory to the Taliban and eventually collapsed, with Kabul falling to the Taliban in 2021. The majority of training of the ANA was undertaken in the Kabul Military Training Centre. In 2019, the ANA had approximately 180,000 soldiers out of an authorized strength of 195,000. Despite its significant manpower on paper, in reality a significant portion of the Afghan National Army manpower were made up of ghost soldiers.

Following the withdrawal of U.S. and allied troops from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, in the face of a rapid Taliban offensive, the Afghan National Army largely disintegrated. Following the escape of President Ashraf Ghani and the fall of Kabul, remaining ANA soldiers either deserted their posts or surrendered to the Taliban. Some ANA remnants reportedly joined the anti-Taliban National Resistance Front of Afghanistan in the Panjshir Valley (see Republican insurgency in Afghanistan).

== History ==
=== The Royal Afghan Army ===

Historically, Afghans have served in the army of the Ghaznavids (963–c.1187), Ghurids (1148–1215), Delhi Sultanate (1206–1527), and the Mughals (1526–1858). The Afghan Army traces its origin to the early 18th century when the Hotak dynasty rose to power in Kandahar and defeated the Persian Safavid Empire at the Battle of Gulnabad in 1722.

When Ahmad Shah Durrani formed the Durrani Empire in 1747, in general, tribes were responsible for providing troops to the king. The only national army that existed during Ahmad Shah&#x27;s time consisted of small groups that functioned as royal bodyguards. The Afghan Army fought a number of battles in the Punjab region of India during the 19th century. One of the famous battles was the 1761 Battle of Panipat in which the Afghan army decisively defeated the Hindu Maratha Empire. The Afghans then fought with the Sikh Empire, until finally, the Sikh Marshal Hari Singh Nalwa died and Sikh conquests stopped. In 1839, the British successfully invaded Afghanistan and installed the exiled Shah Shujah Durrani into power. Their occupation of Afghanistan was challenged after Dost Mohammad&#x27;s son, Wazir Akbar Khan and the forces he led revolted against the occupying British. By October 1841 disaffected Afghan tribes were flocking to the support of Wazir Akbar Khan in Bamian. The success of Akbar Khan&#x27;s uprising led to the 1842 retreat from Kabul where the Afghan army decimated British forces, thanks to effective use of the rugged terrain and weapons such as the Jezail.
At the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80), Ali Ahmad Jalali cites sources saying that the regular army was about 50,000 strong and consisted of 62 infantry and 16 cavalry regiments, with 324 guns mostly organized in horse and mountain artillery batteries. Jalali writes that &#x27;..although Amir Shir Ali Khan (1863–78) is widely credited for founding the modern Afghan Army, it was only under Abdur Rahman that it became a viable and effective institution.&#x27; The Library of Congress Country Study for Afghanistan states that when Abdur Rahman came to the throne circa 1880:

&quot;..the army was virtually nonexistent. With the assistance of a liberal financial loan from the British, plus their aid in the form of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies, [Abdur Rahman] began a 20-year task of creating a respectable regular force by instituting measures that formed the long-term basis of the military system. These included increasing the equalization of military obligation by setting up a system known as the hasht nafari (whereby one man in every eight between the ages of 20 and 40 took his turn at military service); constructing an arsenal in Kabul to reduce dependence on foreign sources for small arms and other ordnance; introducing supervised training courses; organizing troops into divisions, brigades, and regiments, including battalions of artillery; developing pay schedules; and introducing an elementary (and harsh) disciplinary system.

Further improvements to the Army were made by King Amanullah Khan in the early 20th century just before the Third Anglo-Afghan War. King Amanullah fought against the British in 1919, resulting in Afghanistan becoming fully independent after the Treaty of Rawalpindi was signed. It appears from reports of Naib Sular Abdur Rahim&#x27;s career that a Cavalry Division was in existence in the 1920s, with him being posted to the division in Herat Province in 1913 and Mazar-i-Sharif after 1927. A military academy was in existence by Amanullah&#x27;s reign. The Army fought the Soviet Union in the Urtatagai conflict (1925–1926) over a border island, following earlier fighting in 1913. In 1927 Afghanistan invited Turkey to send a military advisory mission, resulting in a strengthening of Afghan divisions and brigades, &quot;augmenting each echelon headquarters with supporting staff;&quot; and &quot;regularizing the officer corps&quot;. The Afghan Army was expanded during King Zahir Shah&#x27;s reign, starting in 1933. In 1934, soldiers of the Royal Afghan Army were also taught the Japanese martial art of Jujutsu by His Excellency Abdullah Khan, at the royal army school.

From 1949–1950 to 1961, Afghanistan-Pakistan skirmishes took place along the frontier, culminating in fighting in Bajaur Agency in September 1960. This led to a breakoff in diplomatic relations between the two countries in September 1961.

In 1953, Lieutenant General Mohammed Daoud Khan, cousin of the King who had previously served as Minister of Defence, was transferred from command of the Central Corps in Kabul to become Prime Minister of Afghanistan. The Central Corps was headquartered at Amanullah&#x27;s Darulaman Palace. On the opening day of Parliament in October 1965, a violent student demonstration among which Babrak Karmal was at the forefront forced Zahir Shah&#x27;s new prime minister Yousef to resign. Two students were killed when the new corps commander, General Abdul Wali, sent in troops to restore order.

From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Afghan Army received training and equipment mostly from the Soviet Union. The Royal Afghan Army was also photographed wearing white “snegurochka” winter suits in snowy areas of the country and also had armored riverboats in their inventory, as seen in a parade in Kabul. In February–March 1957, the first group of Soviet military specialists (about 10, including interpreters) was sent to Kabul to train Afghan officers and non-commissioned officers. At the time, there seems to have been significant Turkish influence in the Afghan Armed Forces, which waned quickly after the Soviet advisors arrived. By the late 1950s, Azimi describes three corps, each with a number of divisions, along the eastern border with Pakistan and several independent divisions.

In a 1961 manual titled “Royalist Regulations” for the Royal Afghan Army, there were illustrations of numerous branch insignias, denoting the specialities and the role of the soldier wearing them. These include:

* “Academy” (اکادمی), worn by recruits who were still in a military academy
* “Infantry” (پیاده), the most common insignia, worn by most soldiers who have finished training and graduated from the academy
* “Cavalry” (سواری), worn by the Royal Afghan Army&#x27;s cavalrymen on horseback
* “Artillery” (طومي), worn by artillery men
* “Tank”(تانک), worn by tank operators of the Royal Afghan Army&#x27;s tank brigades
* “Fortification” (استحكام), worn by soldiers involved in the construction of defensive structures
* “Communications” (مخابره), worn by soldiers part of the army&#x27;s signal regiments
* “Gendarmerie” (شاندارم), worn by the paramilitary police force
* “Vehicle” (نقلیه) worn by motorized/mechanized units
* “Logistics” (لفوازير), worn by units specializing in transportation and supply
* “Cartography” (خریطہ), worn by soldiers specializing in map-making and mapping
* “Judicial” (قضا), worn by members of the military court
* “Field Medic” (صحید), worn by soldiers who are qualified medics
* “Subfield Medic” ( پرسونال فرعی صحید), worn by soldiers who distributed medicine
* “Veterinary” (وترین), worn by veterinarians who specialized in animal care
* “Minor Personnel” (پرسونال فرعی و ریز), worn by support staff and soldiers with specialized technical skills
* “Instructor” (معلم), worn by personnel responsible for training recruits
* “Chemical Warfare” (کیمیای عربی), worn by units that specialize in the use of chemical agents
* “Engineer” (انجنیر), worn by soldiers who specialize in engineering
* “Ordnance” (وسله پالی), worn by soldiers managing equipment such as weapons, bombs and ammunition
* “Finance” (مالی), worn by the army&#x27;s accountants who manage finances and budgeting
* “Music” (موزیک), worn by the military band of the Royal Afghan Army
In the early 1970s, Soviet military assistance was increased. The number of Soviet military specialists increased from 1,500 in 1973 to 5,000 by April 1978. The senior Soviet specialist at this time (from 29 November 1972 until 11 December 1975) was a Major General I.S. Bondarets (И.С. Бондарец), and from 1975 to 1978, the senior Soviet military adviser was Major General L.N. Gorelov. Before the Saur Revolution in 1978, according to Jacobs, the army included three armored divisions; infantry divisions averaging 4,500 to 8,000 men each; “two mountain infantry brigades, one artillery brigade, a guards regiment (for palace protection), three artillery regiments, two commando regiments, and a parachute battalion, which was largely grounded. All the formations were under the control of three corps level headquarters. All but three infantry divisions were facing Pakistan along a line from Bagram south to Kandahar.&quot; The guards regiment additionally performed ceremonial duties. There were 570 medium tanks, plus more Soviet T-55 tanks on order. The Afghan Army was also referred to as the Afghan Republican Army, or simply the “Republican Army”, in a Kabul Times newspaper, a few days after the 1973 Afghan coup d&#x27;état.

=== Socialist Afghanistan ===
On 27 April 1978 the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan, led by Nur Mohammad Taraki, Babrak Karmal and Amin overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was killed the next day, along with most of his family. On 1 May, Taraki became President, Prime Minister and General Secretary of the PDPA. The country was then renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), and the PDPA government lasted until April 1992.

In 1980, under President Babrak Karmal, the Ministry of Defense drafted plans to form three Spetsnaz battalions for each of the army corps. A year later, in 1981, the 203rd Separate Spetsnaz Battalion was formed (alongside the 212th, 230th and 211th) under the 1st Central Army Corps in Kabul and subordinated to KhAD-e Nezami (military intelligence). The 203rd Battalion reportedly worked alongside the Spetsnaz GRU and the Soviet Border Troops, as well as with the Soviet Airborne Forces.

The army lost much of its strength during the early stages of PDPA rule. One of the main reasons for the small size was that the Soviet military were afraid the Afghan army would defect &quot;en masse&quot; to the enemy if total personnel increased. There were several sympathisers of the mujahideen within the military. Even so, there were several elite units under the command of the Afghan army, for instance, the 26th Airborne Battalion, 444th, 37th and 38th Commando Brigades, all part of the Afghan Commando Forces. The 26th Airborne Battalion proved politically unreliable, and in 1979, they revolted against the PDPA government. As a result, the 26th Airborne Battalion was reformed and turned into the 37th Commando Battalion. In the same year, the 81st Artillery Regiment were given airborne training and converted into the 38th Commando Battalion. The Commando Brigades were, in contrast, considered reliable and were used as mobile strike forces until they sustained excessive casualties. Insurgents ambushed and inflicted heavy casualties on the 38th Commando Brigade during the Second Battle of Zhawar in Paktika Province in May 1983. After sustaining heavy casualties the commando brigades were turned into battalions.

Most soldiers were recruited for a three-year term, later extended to four-year terms in 1984.

After the PDPA seizure of power, desertions swept the force, affecting the loyalty and moral values of soldiers. There were purges on patriotic junior and senior officers, and upper class Afghan aristocrats in society. On 15 March 1979, the Herat uprising broke out. The 17th Division was detailed by the regime to put down the rebellion, but this proved a mistake, as there were few Khalqi faction soldiers in the division and instead it mutinied and joined the uprising. Forces from Kabul had to be dispatched to suppress the rebellion.

Gradually the Army&#x27;s three armoured divisions and now sixteen infantry divisions dropped in size to on average around 2,500 strong, quarter strength, by 1985. One of the first series of defections occurred in the 9th Division, which, Urban wrote, defected by brigades in response to the Soviet intervention. It lost its 5th Brigade at Asmar in August 1979 and its 30th Mountain Brigade in 1980. After Soviet advisors arrived in 1977, they inspired a number of adaptations and reorganisations. In April 1982, the 7th Division was moved from the capital. The division, which was commanded by Khalqi Major General Zia-Ud-Din, had its depleted combat resources spread out along the Kabul-Kandahar highway. In 1984–1985, all infantry divisions were restructured to a common design. In 1985 Army units were relieved of security duties, making more available for combat operations.

During the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War, the Army fought against the mujahideen rebel groups. Deserters or defectors became a severe problem. The Afghan Army&#x27;s casualties were as high as 50–60,000 soldiers and another 50,000 soldiers deserted the Army. The Afghan Army&#x27;s defection rate was about 10,000 soldiers per year between 1980 and 1989; the average deserters left the Afghan Army after the first five months.

Local militias were also important to the Najibullah regime&#x27;s security efforts. From 1988 several new divisions were formed from former Regional Forces/militias&#x27; formations: the 53rd Infantry Division – the &quot;Jowzyani militia&quot; of Abdul Rashid Dostum raised from Sheberghan, the 55th, 80th, 93rd, 94th, 95th, and 96th, plus, possibly, a division in Lashkar Gah.

As compensation for the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the USSR agreed to deliver sophisticated weapons to the government, among which were large quantities of Scud surface-to-surface missiles. The first 500 were transferred during the early months of 1989, and soon proved to be extremely useful, a critical asset. During the mujahideen attack against Jalalabad, between March and June 1989, three firing batteries manned by Afghan crews advised by Soviets fired approximately 438 missiles. Soon Scuds were in use in all the heavily contested areas of Afghanistan. After January 1992, the Soviet advisors were withdrawn, reducing the Afghan Army&#x27;s ability to use their ballistic missiles. On 24 April 1992, the mujahideen forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud (Jamiat-e Islami) captured the main Scud stockpile at Afshar, Kabul, belonging to the 99th Missile Brigade. Shia Hazara groups, such as Harakat-e Islami, additionally gained Scud missile launchers. As the government collapsed, the few remaining Scuds and their transporter erector launchers were divided among the rival factions fighting for power. However, the missile operators managed to successfully flee and a lack of trained personnel prevented a sustained use of such weapons, and, between April 1992 and 1996, only 44 Scuds were fired in Afghanistan.

=== 1992 and after ===
In spring 1992, the Afghan Army consisted of five corps – 1st Corps at Jalalabad, 2nd at Kandahar, 3rd Corps at Gardez, 4th Corps at Herat, and 6th Corps at Kunduz – as well as five smaller operations groups, including one at Charikar, which had been 5th Corps until it was reduced in status. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Corps, and the operations groups at Sarobi and Khost, nearly completely disintegrated in 1992. Formations in and around Kabul joined different mujahideen militias while forces in the north and west remained intact for a longer period. Forces in the north and west were taken over by three major commanders: Ismael Khan, Ahmed Shah Masoud, and Abdul Rashid Dostam.

On 18 April 1992, the PDPA garrison at Kunduz surrendered to local mujahideen commanders. The 54th Division base at Kunduz was handed over to the overall military leader of Ittehad in the area, Amir Chughay. Dostum and commanders loyal to him formed Junbesh I-Melli, the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan. The NIM grouped the former regime&#x27;s 18th, 20th, 53rd, 54th, and 80th Divisions, plus several brigades. By mid-1994 there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. Dostum&#x27;s 6th Corps was based at Pul-i-Khumri and had three divisions. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government&#x27;s 6th Corps was based at Kunduz and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum&#x27;s corps. By 1995 Masoud controlled three corps commands: the Central Corps at Kabul, the best organised with a strength of 15–20,000, the 5th Corps at Herat covering the west, and the 6th Corps at Kunduz covering the northeast.

By 1996 the Taliban Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan seized the country, aiming to control it by Islamic Sharia law. The Taliban&#x27;s army and commanders placed emphasis on simplicity; some were secretly trained by the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence and Pakistani Armed Forces around the Durand Line.
After the removal of the Taliban government through the United States invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, private armies loyal to warlords gained more and more influence. In mid-2001, Ali Ahmed Jalali wrote:

The army (as a state institution, organized, armed, and commanded by the state) does not exist in Afghanistan today. Neither the Taliban-led &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&quot; nor the &quot;Islamic State of Afghanistan&quot; headed by the ousted President Rabbani has the political legitimacy or administrative efficiency of a state. The militia formations they command are composed of odd assortments of armed groups with varying level of loyalties, political commitment, professional skills, and organizational integrity. Many of them feel free to switch sides, shift loyalties, and join or leave the group spontaneously. The country suffers from the absence of a top political layer capable of controlling individual and group violence. ... Although both sides identify their units with military formations of the old regime, there is hardly any organizational or professional continuity from the past. But these units really exist in name only ... [i]n fact only their military bases still exist, accommodating and supporting an assortment of militia groups.

Formations in existence by the end of 2002 included the 1st Army Corps (Nangarhar), 2nd Army Corps (Kandahar, dominated by Gul Agha Sherzai), 3rd Army Corps (Paktia, where the US allegedly attempted to impose Atiqullah Ludin as commander), 4th Army Corps (Herat, dominated by Ismail Khan), 6th Army Corps at Kunduz, 7th Army Corps (under Atta Muhammad Nur at Balkh), 8th Army Corps (at Jowzjan, dominated by Dostum&#x27;s National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan) and the Central Army Corps around Kabul. In addition, there were divisions with strong links to the centre in Kabul. These included the 1st in Kabul, 27th in Qalat, 31st in Kabul, 34th in Bamiyan (4th Corps), 36th in Logar, 41st in Ghor, 42nd in Wardak, 71st in Farah, and 100th in Laghman.

The International Crisis Group wrote:

New divisions and even army corps were created to recognise factional realities or undermine the power base of individual commanders, often without regard to the troop levels normally associated with such units. For example, the ministry in July 2002 recognised a 25th Division in Khost province, formed by the Karzai-appointed governor, Hakim Taniwal, to unseat a local warlord, Padshah Khan Zadran, who was then occupying the governor&#x27;s residence. At its inception, however, the division had only 700 men – the size of a battalion.
The 93rd Division of the AMF, which Malkasian&#x27;s &quot;The American War in Afghanistan&quot; (2021) describes as &quot;1,200 strong&quot; was later reported in southern Helmand.

Even by December 2004 Human Rights Watch was still saying in an open letter to Karzai that: &quot;Abdul Rabb al-Rasul Sayyaf, the head of the Ittihad-i Islami faction and the Daw&#x27;at-e Islami party [should be curbed]. Sayyaf has no government post but has used his power over the Supreme Court and other courts across the country to curtail the rights of journalists, civic society activists, and even political candidates. He also controls militias, including forces recognized as the 10th Division of the Afghan army, which intimidate and abuse Afghans even inside Kabul. We ask that you express public opposition to Sayyaf&#x27;s activities, explicitly state your opposition to such misuse of unofficial authority, and move expeditiously to disarm and demobilize armed forces associated with Ittihad-i Islami and other unofficial forces.&quot;
=== Afghan National Army (2002–2021) ===

During the Bonn Conference on Afghanistan in early December 2001, President Hamid Karzai issued a decree reestablishing a unified army, the Afghan National Army. The decree set a size target of 70,000 (by 2009) and laid out the planned army structure. There had been significant disagreement over the size of the army that was needed. A Ministry of Defense-issued paper said that at least 200,000 active troops were needed. The Afghan Ministry of Defence loudly objected to the smaller, volunteer, nature of the new army, a change from the previous usage of conscripts. The US also blocked the new government from using the army to pressure Pakistan.

The first new Afghan kandak (battalion) was trained by British Army personnel of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), becoming 1st Battalion, Afghan National Guard. Yet while the British troops provided high quality training, they were few in number. After some consideration, it was decided that the United States might be able to provide the training. Thus follow-on kandaks were recruited and trained by 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group. 3rd SFG built the training facilities and ranges for early use, using a Soviet built facility on the eastern side of Kabul, near the then ISAF headquarters.

Recruiting and training began in May 2002, with a difficult but successful recruitment process of bringing hundreds of new recruits in from all parts of Afghanistan. Training was initially done in Pashto and Dari (Persian dialect) and some Arabic due to the very diverse ethnicities. The original US target in April 2002 was that of 12,000 men trained by April 2003, but it was quickly realised that this was too ambitious, and the requirement reduced to only 9,000, to be ready by November 2003. The first female Afghan parachutist Khatol Mohammadzai, trained during the 1980s, became the first female general in the Afghan National Army in August 2002.
The National Military Academy of Afghanistan, a West Point analogue and part of the Marshal Fahim National Defense University based in Qargha Garrison, was also established to produce officers. The NMAA administered a four-year military and civil training programme with the aim of preparing the prospective officer for the long-term. The NMAA taught four major foreign languages, vital to developing the relationship between the ANA and foreign armies.

The U.S. Army&#x27;s major objectives for the ANA in October 2002 were:
* Ensure activation of Central Corps headquarters and its three Brigades by 1 October 2003
* Develop and begin implementation of Afghan MoD/General Staff reform plan
* Establish ANA institutional support systems including officer and NCO schools, ANA training and doctrine directorate, and garrison support elements
* Design and build Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A) ..consisting of US/Coalition military, contractor, and Afghan civilian and military personnel capable of managing the ANA building program as it increases in scope and complexity
* Increase international and Afghan domestic support for and confidence in ANA through the maintenance of quality within the force and the conduct of effective information operations.

The first deployment outside Kabul was made by 3rd Kandak ANA to Paktika Province, including Orgun, in January 2003. By January 2003 just over 1,700 soldiers in five &quot;Kandaks&quot; (battalions) had completed the 10-week training course, and by mid-2003 a total of 4,000 troops had been trained. Approximately 1,000 ANA soldiers were deployed in the US-led Operation Warrior Sweep, marking the first major combat operation for Afghan troops. Initial recruiting problems lay in the lack of cooperation from regional warlords and inconsistent international support. The problem of desertion dogged the force from the outset: in the summer of 2003, the desertion rate was estimated to be 10% and in mid-March 2004, an estimate suggested that 3,000 soldiers had deserted. Some recruits were under 18 years of age and many could not read or write. Recruits who only spoke the Pashto language experienced difficulty because instruction was usually given through interpreters who spoke Dari.

The Afghan New Beginnings Programme (ANBP) was launched on 6 April 2003 and begin disarmament of former Army personnel in October 2003. In March 2004, fighting between two local militias took place in the western Afghan city of Herat. It was reported that Mirwais Sadiq (son of warlord Ismail Khan) was assassinated in unclear circumstances. Thereafter a bigger conflict began that resulted in the death of up to 100 people. The battle was between troops of Ismail Khan and Abdul Zahir Nayebzada, a senior local military commander blamed for the death of Sadiq. Nayebzada commanded the 17th Herat Division of the Afghan Militia Forces&#x27; 4th Corps. In response to the fighting, about 1,500 newly trained ANA soldiers were sent to Herat in order to bring the situation under control.

In addition to the fighting units, establishment of regional structures began when four of the five planned corps commanders and some of their staff were appointed on 1 September 2004. The first regional command was established in Kandahar on 19 September; the second at Gardez on 22 September, with commands at Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat planned. The Gardez command, also referred to in the AFPS story as the 203 Corps, was to have an initial force of 200 soldiers. Kandahar&#x27;s command was the first activated, followed by Gardez and Mazar-e-Sharif. The Herat command was seemingly activated on 28 September. The next year, the ANA&#x27;s numbers grew to around 20,000 soldiers, most of which were trained by the United States Army. In the meantime, the United States Army Corps of Engineers started building new military camps for the fast-growing army.

In 2003, the United States issued guidelines to ensure the army&#x27;s ethnic balance. By late 2012, the ANA was composed of 43% Pashtuns, 32% Tajiks, 12% Hazaras, 8% Uzbeks, and the rest were smaller ethnic groups of Afghanistan. However, the army did not track the actual ethnic composition of the officer corps. There were no quotas for the enlisted soldiers.

By March 2011, a National Military Command Center had been established in Kabul, which was being mentored by personnel from the Virginia Army National Guard.

==== Costs and salaries ====
Under the US–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, the United States designated Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally and agreed to fund the ANA until at least 2024. This included soldiers&#x27; salaries, providing training and weapons, and all other military costs.

Soldiers in the Army initially received $30 a month during training and $50 a month upon graduation, though the basic pay for trained soldiers later rose to $165. This starting salary increased to $230 a month in an area with moderate security issues and to $240 in those provinces where there was heavy fighting. About 95% of the men and women who served in the military were paid by electronic funds transfer. Special biometrics were used during the registration of each soldier.

==== Training and International Partnerships ====

Task Force Phoenix was the initial U.S. and allied force training organisation in 2002. This program was formalized in April 2003, based near the Kabul Military Training Center. Coalition efforts were initially overseen by OMC-A, then Office of Security Cooperation-Afghanistan, then from 2006 to 2009, by the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A), a three-star level multi-national command headquartered in downtown Kabul. On the Afghan side, by 2011 all training and education in the Army was run by Afghan National Army Training Command, a two-star command which reported directly to the Chief of the General Staff. All training centers and military schools were under this command.

Individual basic training was conducted primarily by Afghan instructors and staff at the Kabul Military Training Center, situated on the eastern edge of Kabul. The United States Department of Defense assisted in basic and advanced training of enlisted recruits, and also ran the Drill Instructor School which ran basic training courses for training NCOs. Basic training had been expanded to include required literacy courses for illiterate recruits. A French Army advisory team oversaw the training of officers for staff and platoon or toli (company) command in a combined commissioning/infantry officer training unit called the Officer Training Brigade (OTB). OTB candidates in the platoon and company command courses were usually former militia and mujaheddin leaders with various levels of military experience. The United Kingdom also conducted initial infantry officer training and commissioning at the Officer Candidate School (OCS). OCS candidates were young men with little or no military experience. The British Army also conducted initial and advanced Non-Commissioned Officer training as well in a separate NCO Training Brigade.

The Canadian Forces supervised the Combined Training Exercise portion of initial military training, where trainee soldiers, NCOs, and officers were brought together in field training exercises at the platoon, toli (company) and kandak (battalion) levels to certify them ready for field operations. In the Regional Corps, Coalition Embedded Training Teams continued to mentor the kandak&#x27;s leadership, and advised them in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics.

During the ISAF era, advisers in the US Embedded Training Teams and NATO Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams acted as liaisons between the Afghan Army and coalition forces. The teams coordinated planning and ensured that ANA units received U.S./Coalition support.

Formal education and professional development was conducted at two main ANATC schools, both in Kabul. The National Military Academy of Afghanistan, located near the Kabul International Airport, was a four-year military university which produced degree second lieutenants in a variety of military professions. NMAA&#x27;s first cadet class entered its second academic year in spring 2006. A contingent of US and Turkish instructors jointly mentored the NMAA faculty and staff. The Command and General Staff College, located in southern Kabul, prepared mid-level ANA officers to serve on brigade and corps staffs. France established the CGSC in early 2004, and a cadre of French Army instructors continued to oversee operations at the school.

Sizable numbers of Afghan National Army Officers were sent to be trained in India either at the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun, the National Defence Academy near Pune or the Officers Training Academy in Chennai. The Indian Military Academy which had been in existence since 1932, provided a four-year degree to ANA army officers, while the National Defence Academy provided a 3-year degree after which officers underwent a one-year specialization in their respective service colleges. The Officers Training Academy provided a 49-week course to Graduate officer candidates. In 2014 the number of Afghan officers in training in India was nearly 1100.

In October 2007, ANA international partners said they had seen progress and were pleased with Afghan performance in recent exercises. Colonel Thomas McGrath estimated that the ANA would be capable of carrying out independent brigade-size operations by the spring of 2008. Despite high hopes, four years after McGrath&#x27;s estimated date for independent brigade-sized operations, not a single one of the ANA&#x27;s 180 kandaks could carry out independent operations, much less an entire brigade. On 30 July 2013, US Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Lavoy told reporters in Washington, D.C., according to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, that &#x27;... a residual [US] force would be needed to help the ANSF complete more mundane tasks such as logistics, ensuring soldiers get their paychecks, procuring food, awarding fuel contracts, and more.&#x27; Lavoy noted that the Afghans were still developing those skills and it would be &quot;well beyond the 2014 date&quot; before they were expected to be capable.

An increasing number of female soldiers joined. By early 2013, reports stated that there were 200,000 ANA troops. However, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in January 2013 that &quot;Determining ANSF strength is fraught with challenges. US and coalition forces rely on the Afghan forces to report their own personnel strength numbers. ..[T]he Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan.. noted that.. there is &quot;no viable method of validating [the ANA&#x27;s] personnel numbers.&quot; It was reported in 2016 that the Afghan National Army had close to 1,000 officers with the rank of general, more than the number of generals in the United States Army.

==== Ineffectiveness ====
The ANA was plagued by poor cohesion, illiteracy, corruption and abuse. A quarter of ANA troops were reported to have deserted in 2009 with many troops hiding in the heat of battle rather than engaging the enemy. It was reported that approximately 90% of ANA troops were illiterate and there were widespread instances of corruption with the ANA manpower consisting a high percentage of ghost battalions. Another significant problem for the ANA was a high level of drug abuse amongst its soldiers. The Special Investigator General for Afghan Reconstruction reported the number of ANA soldiers using drugs was &quot;at least 50 percent&quot; and might have been as high as 75 percent, according to some reports.

Many officers held loyalties with particular political factions. The endemic corruption of those officers eroded the army&#x27;s morale.

Theft and a lack of discipline plagued many elements of the ANA. US trainers reported missing vehicles, weapons and other military equipment, and outright theft of fuel provided by the US to the ANA. Death threats had been leveled against some US officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing. Some Afghan soldiers often found improvised explosive devices and snipped the command wires instead of marking them and waiting for US forces to come to detonate them. The practice allowed insurgents to return and reconnect them. US trainers frequently had to remove the cell phones from Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation would be compromised by bragging, gossip and reciprocal warnings.

At times ANA troops attacked their own troops and foreign troops of ISAF. Fragging had worsened enough to the point where two decrees were issued by the Department of Defense in the summer of 2012 stating that all American personnel serving in Afghanistan were told to carry a magazine with their weapon at all times, and that when a group of American troops were present and on duty with ANA forces, one American serviceman had to stand apart on guard with a loaded weapon ready. In addition to fragging, a report by a US inspector general revealed 5,753 cases of &quot;gross human rights abuses by Afghan forces&quot;, including &quot;routine enslavement and rape of underage boys (Bacha bazi) by Afghan commanders&quot;. The ineffectiveness of the ANA became most apparent during the 2021 Taliban offensive; thousands of ANA troops surrendered to the Taliban en masse, with many cities falling to the Taliban unopposed.

President Ashraf Ghani was also accused of replacing officers with people who supported his ideas, leading to declining morale among Afghan soldiers and officers.

==== Structure 2002–2021 ====

A January 2011 NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan information paper described the ANA as being led by the Chief of General Staff, supervising the Vice Chief of the General Staff, the Vice Chief of the Armed Forces (an Air Force officer), the Director of the General Staff, himself supervising the General Staff itself, and seven major commands. The ANA Ground Force Command, under a lieutenant general, directed the regional ground forces corps and the 111th Capital Division. Amongst support facilities were two National Ammunition Depots, at Khairabad, and at Chimtallah National Ammunition Depot, both in the environs of the capital, plus four corps-level Ammunition Supply Points.

===== Corps and other major commands =====
At its largest the Afghan National Army had seven corps; each corps was responsible for an area of the country. Establishment of the corps started when four regional commands were established with some staff in September 2004. The Afghan National Army Air Corps later renamed the Afghan Air Force also formed part of the army. Each corps had three to four subordinate brigades, and each brigade had four infantry Kandaks (battalions) as basic fighting units. Each kandak was assigned a specific area for which it is responsible for; its mission was to secure its area from internal and external threats.

Originally, the four outlying corps were assigned one or two brigades, with the majority of the manpower of the Army based in Kabul&#x27;s 201st Corps. This was superseded by a buildup in which each corps added extra brigades. Originally, the 2008 Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan size target was for a total of 14 brigades: 13 infantry, one mechanized, and one commando.

In 2019–2021 the regionally focused corps were as follows:
* 201st Corps (Kabul) – 1st Brigade was based at the Presidential Palace. 3rd Brigade, at Pol-e-Chakri, was to be a mechanised formation including M-113s and Soviet-built main battle tanks (T-62s). In early 2008 LongWarJournal.org placed most of the 3rd Brigade at Jalalabad, 2nd Brigade at Pol-e-Charkhi, and only a single kandak of 1st Brigade at the Presidential Palace. The corps area of responsibility included Eastern Afghanistan, including Kabul, Logar, Kapisa, Konar, and Laghman provinces. This included Kabul as well as vital routes running north and south, and valleys leading from the Pakistani border into Afghanistan.
* 203rd Corps (Gardez) The original Gardez Regional Command was established on 23 September 2004. As of 2009, First Brigade, Khost, Second Brigade, Forward Operating Base Rushmore, Sharana, Paktika Province, Third Brigade, Ghazni. On 19 Oct 2006, as part of Operation Mountain Fury, two ETTs (Embedded Training Teams) mentored and advised a D30 artillery section from Fourth Kandak, Second Brigade, 203rd Corps, to conduct the first artillery missions during combat operations with harassment and indirect fires. Three days later, they successfully conducted counterfire (with assistance from a US Q-36 radar) that resulted in a reported ten enemy casualties. The corps is supported by the Gardez Regional Support Squadron of the AAF, equipped with 8 helicopters: 4 transport to support the corps&#x27; commando kandak, two attack, and two medical transport.
* 205th Corps (Kandahar) – oversaw the provinces of Kandahar, Zabul, and 4th Brigade Urozgan under Brigadier General Zafar Khan&#x27;s control. It consisted of four brigades, a commando kandak and three garrisons. The corps had integrated artillery and airlift capacity, supplied by a growing Kandahar Wing of the Afghan Air Force.
* 207th Corps (Herat) – 1st Brigade at Herat, 2nd Brigade at Farah, and elements at Shindand (including commandos). The corps was supported by the Herat Regional Support Squadron of the AAF, equipped with eight helicopters: four transport to support the corps&#x27; commando kandak, two attack, and two medical transport aircraft.
* 209th Corps (Mazar-i-Sharif) – Worked closely with the German-led Regional Command North, and had 1st Brigade at Mazar-i-Sharif and, it appears, a Second Brigade forming at Kunduz. An Army Corps of Engineers solicitation for Kunduz headquarters facilities for the Second Brigade was issued in March 2008. The corps was supported by the Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Support Squadron of the AAF, equipped with eight helicopters: four transport to support the Corps&#x27; commando kandak, two attack, and two medical transport helicopters. In October 2015, as a response to the fall of Kunduz, reports came that a new division would be formed in the area.
* 215th Corps (Lashkar Gah) – In 2010, the Afghan government approved a sixth corps of the Afghan National Army – Corps 215 Maiwand – to be based in the Helmand capital of Lashkar Gah. The 215th was developed specifically to partner with the Marine Expeditionary Brigade in Helmand. On 28 January 2010, Xinhua reported that General Sayed Mallok would command the new corps. The corps will cover all parts of Helmand, half of Farah and most parts of southwestern Nimroz province. The corps was formally established on 1 April 2010. 1st Bde, 215th Corps, is at Garmsir, partnered with a USMC Regimental Combat Team. Elements of 2nd Brigade, 215th Corps, had been reported at Forward Operating Base Delaram, Farah Province. 3rd Bde, 215th Corps, partnered with the UK Task Force Helmand is at Camp Shorabak.
*217th Corps (Headquarters Kunduz) In 2019, the 20th Division, which was formerly part of the 209th Corps, became the 217th Corps. The corps was given responsibility for Kunduz Province, Takhar, Baghlan, and Badakhshan provinces. In August 2021, the Taliban seized control of the corps headquarters and Kunduz as part of the 2021 Taliban offensive.
*111th Capital Division – in late 2008 it was announced that the 201st Corps&#x27; former area of responsibility would be divided, with a Capital Division being formed in Kabul and the corps concentrating its effort further forward along the border. The new division, designated the 111th Capital Division, became operational in April 2009. It had a First Brigade and Second Brigade (both forming) as well as a Headquarters Special Security Brigade.

Most of the corps were retained, with their existing numerical designations, but renamed, in November 2021, after the Taliban seized power.

Other commands included:
*ANA Special Operations Command – from mid-2011, the ANA began establishing a Special Operations Command to control the Commando Brigade and the ANA Special Forces. Its headquarters was established at Camp Moorehead in Wardak Province, south of Kabul. In July 2007 the ANA graduated its first commandos. The commandos underwent a grueling three-month course being trained by American special forces. They were fully equipped with US equipment and had received specialized light infantry training with the capability to conduct raids, direct action, and reconnaissance in support of counterinsurgency operations; they also provided a strategic response capability for the Afghan government.
*Army Support Command, the ANA Recruiting Command, the Headquarters Security and Support Brigade (HSSB), and the Detainee Guard Force (as of 2011).
*The ANA Ground Force Command was active . Under a lieutenant general it directed the regional ground forces corps and the 111th Capital Division. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense expressed concerns with the ANA Ground Force Command in these terms in March 2013, as the U.S. and allies: &quot;began developing the Ground Forces Command in April 2009 and it is scheduled to achieve full operational capability for command and control of ANA forces by October 2012. However, it may take longer for the Ministry of Defense, General Staff, and some Corps Commanders to embrace this new organization. Several ANSF stakeholders expressed their belief that GFC was an unnecessary, intermediate layer of bureaucracy. A number of Afghan security officials conveyed doubts about the long-term existence of the GFC HQ after 2014.&quot; ..&quot;General Staff reluctance to identify and divest authorities and responsibilities to the GFC inhibited the timely development of the Ground Forces Command. Afghan and Coalition officers also reported widespread, lukewarm support among senior level Ministry of Defense and General Staff officers for the establishment of the GFC. Operationally, some Afghan Corps commanders and staff members considered the GFC unnecessary and a redundant headquarters.&quot; The command was eventually disbanded in 2015; it was seen &quot;by many as a redundant and unnecessary bureaucratic layer&quot; between the General Staff and the regional corps.

===== Kandaks (battalions) =====
The basic Afghan National Army unit was the &quot;kandak&quot; (battalion), consisting of 600 troops. Kandaks were made up of four companies (&quot;toli&quot;). Although the vast majority of kandaks were infantry, at least one mechanized and one tank kandak had been formed. Every ANA Corps was assigned commando kandaks.

Seven Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) kandaks were created in 2012–13, one kandak for each of the ANA&#x27;s corps and divisions. They were created by converting existing infantry kandaks into QRF kandaks at the NMAA Armour Branch School. The QRF kandaks were trained and fielded in 2012 and 2013. The QRF kandaks were the first major ANA users of armoured vehicles.

As the ANA grew, the focus changed to further developing the force so that it could become self-sustaining. Development of Combat Support Kandaks [Battalions] (CSK) was vital to any self-sustainability. The CSK role includes motor fleet maintenance, specialized communications, scouting, engineering, and long range artillery units. While most ANA brigades had a CSK, they were underdeveloped and did not fit the requirements of a growing army. Eventually one fully developed CSK was planned to be assigned to each of the 24 army combat brigades. Each CSK included an Intelligence toli (company) called a Cashf Tolai. Each company was responsible for collecting information about the surrounding area and Taliban activities. The members of the unit interacted closely with the local residents in an effort to deny the enemy control over the surrounding area.

Combat service support was not an initial U.S. development priority, as U.S. arrangements could be drawn upon. But in order for the ANA to be self-sufficient, a Corps Logistics Kandak was to be formed which was to be responsible for providing equipment to the 90 infantry kandaks. The CLK was responsible for the maintenance of the new heavier equipment including APCs. In the 215th Corps area, the US Marine Combat Logistics Battalion 1 announced in January 2010 that the training of the ANA 5th Kandak, 1st Brigade, 215th ANA Corps Logistics Kandak has gone very well and that the unit was capable of undertaking the majority of day-to-day activities on their own. The ANA never achieved self-sufficiency and after losing logistical and air support from the U.S., the ANA fell apart during the 2021 Taliban offensive, making a series of negotiated surrenders.

=== Other forces ===
The Afghan Border Force (ABF) was responsible for the security of Afghanistan&#x27;s border area with neighboring countries extending up to into the interior. In December 2017, most of the Afghan Border Police (ABP) personnel of the Afghan National Police were transferred to the Afghan National Army to form the ABF.| The Afghan National Police retained 4,000 ABP personnel for customs operations at border crossings and international airports. The ABF consisted of seven brigades.

The Afghan National Civil Order Force (ANCOF) was responsible for civil order and counterinsurgency. In March 2018, most of the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) personnel of the Afghan National Police were transferred to the Afghan National Army to form the ANCOF with their role remaining the same. The remaining 2,550 ANCOP personnel in the Afghan National Police formed the Public Security Police (PSP). The ANCOF consisted of eight brigades. In June 2020, the ANCOF brigades began to be disbanded with personnel to be integrated into the Afghan National Army.

=== Collapse to Taliban in 2021 and reorganization ===

United States and other remaining NATO troops withdrew from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021. Couple with a rapid offensive conducted by the Taliban, the Afghan National Army then largely disintegrated, with large numbers of ANA soldiers abandoning their posts or surrendering en masse to the Taliban. This allowed the Taliban to capture large quantities of US-provided military equipment, vehicles and aircraft.

The reasons for the collapse were closely connected with the devastating Afghan soldiers&#x27; low morale and massive corruption.

Soon, all the regional forces of the ANA had dissolved, with the exception of the 201st Corps and the 111th Capital Division, both of which were headquartered in Kabul, which had been surrounded by the Taliban. On 15 August 2021, the Taliban entered the outskirts of Kabul from multiple directions, beginning the fall of Kabul. On the same day, President Ashraf Ghani fled the country to Dubai. It was reported that ANA soldiers were fleeing to neighbouring countries in droves, some on foot and others onboard Afghan Air Force aircraft. At 8:55 pm local time, Taliban forces seized the Arg and raised their flag, soon afterwards declaring the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

Following the fall of Kabul, the remaining forces of the ANA either deserted their posts or surrendered to the Taliban. Some remnants of the ANA regrouped in the Panjshir Valley, where they joined the anti-Taliban National Resistance Front of Afghanistan. Around 500–600 remaining Afghan troops, made up mostly of Afghan Commandos, were reported to have refused to surrender to the Taliban in Kabul, and instead joined up with US forces in at Kabul International Airport, helping them secure the outer perimeter of the airport during the evacuation in August 2021. According to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, the US will evacuate these remaining Afghan troops to safety if they wish to leave Afghanistan when the evacuation operation ends.

Since the Taliban took control, there has been more than 200 former Afghan security forces who either disappeared, or were extrajudicially executed. These figures only cover four provinces, meaning the real number of former Afghan security forces disappearing or being executed may be much higher. Taliban soldiers have hunted down former Afghan security forces in the aftermath of the withdrawal.

 the Islamic Emirate Army is subdivided into eight corps, mostly superseding the previous corps of the Afghan National Army. They are listed below. In November 2021 Mullah Yaqoob, Acting Minister of Defense, announced the new names of the corps.

== Equipment ==
The Afghan Army was equipped with the Soviet AK-47 as its main service rifle from the 1970s, with the 444th Commando Battalion being the only unit with access to the rifle in 1968. As a major non-NATO ally of the United States, Afghanistan continued to receive billions of dollars in military assistance and the American M16 rifle joined the AK-47 as the service rifle. In addition, various U.S. rifles, bulletproof vests, night vision goggles, trucks and Mine Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles entered service. The ANA previously had a contract with International Trucks that would provide a fleet of 2,781 trucks which could be used for transporting personnel, water, petroleum and as a recovery vehicle.

Besides NATO, Afghanistan had increasingly turned to its regional allies, India and Russia for military aid and supplies. Both countries supported the Northern Alliance, with funding, training, supplies and medical treatment of wounded fighters, against the Taliban for years prior to the US-led intervention in 2001.

After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, India invested several billion dollars in infrastructure development projects in Afghanistan, besides the training of Afghan officers in India. But India was unwilling to provide military aid unless under an UN-authorised peacekeeping mission. In 2014, India signed an agreement with Russia and Afghanistan where it would pay Russia for all the heavy equipment requested by Afghanistan instead of directly supplying them. The deal also includes the refurbishment of heavy weapons left behind since the Soviet war. Following the end of the 2021 Taliban offensive, much of the Afghan National Army&#x27;s arsenal, including much of its U.S. military hardware, ended up in the hands of the Taliban.

<text>The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (, ; ; , &quot;Roman Orthodox Patriarchate, Ecumenical Patriarchate of Istanbul&quot;) is one of the fifteen to seventeen autocephalous churches that together compose the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is headed by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.

Because of its historical location as the capital of the former Eastern Roman Empire and its role as the mother church of most modern Eastern Orthodox churches, Constantinople holds a special place of honor within Eastern Orthodox Christianity and serves as the seat for the Ecumenical Patriarch, who enjoys the status of &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals) among the world&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox prelates and is regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians.

The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople promotes the expansion of the Christian faith and Eastern Orthodox doctrine, and the Ecumenical Patriarchs are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of Orthodox Christian traditions. Prominent issues for the Ecumenical Patriarchate&#x27;s policy in the 21st century include the safety of the believers in the Middle East, reconciliation of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches, and the reopening of the Theological School of Halki, which was closed down by the Turkish authorities in 1971.

== History ==

===The Great Church of Christ===

In 330 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great moved his residence to the town renaming it &quot;Nova Roma&quot; (), or &quot;New Rome&quot;. Thenceforth, the importance of the church there grew, along with the influence of its bishop. Prior to the moving of the imperial capital, the bishop of Byzantium had been under the authority of the metropolitan of Heraclea, but from the 4th century on, he grew to become independent in his own right and even to exercise authority throughout what is now Greece, Asia Minor, Pontus, and Thrace. With the development of the hierarchical structure of the Church, the bishop of Constantinople came to be styled as exarch (a position superior to metropolitan). Constantinople was recognized as the fourth patriarchate at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, after Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome. The patriarch was usually appointed by Antioch.

Because of the importance of the position of Constantinople&#x27;s church at the center of the Roman Empire, affairs involving the various churches outside Constantinople&#x27;s direct authority came to be discussed in the capital, particularly where the intervention of the emperor was desired. The patriarch naturally became a liaison between the emperor and bishops traveling to the capital, thus establishing the position of the patriarch as one involving the unity of the whole Church, particularly in the East.

In turn, the affairs of the Constantinopolitan church were overseen not just by the patriarch, but also by synods held including visiting bishops. This pan-Orthodox synod came to be referred to as the (, &quot;resident synod&quot;). The resident synod not only governed the business of the patriarchate but also examined questions pertinent to the whole Church as well as the eastern half of the old empire. The patriarch thus came to have the title of &quot;Ecumenical&quot;, which referenced not a universal episcopacy over other bishops but rather the position of the patriarch as at the center of the , the &quot;household&quot; of the empire.

As the Roman Empire stabilized and grew, so did the influence of the patriarchate at its capital. This influence came to be enshrined in Orthodox canon law, to such an extent that it was elevated even beyond more ancient patriarchates: Canon 3 of the First Council of Constantinople (381) stated that the bishop of that city &quot;shall have primacy of honor after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is the New Rome.&quot;

In its disputed 28th Canon, the Council of Chalcedon in 451 recognized an expansion of the boundaries of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and of its authority over bishops of dioceses &quot;among the barbarians&quot;, which has been variously interpreted as referring either to areas outside the Byzantine Empire or to non-Greeks. The council resulted in a schism with the Patriarchate of Alexandria.

In any case, for almost a thousand years the Patriarch of Constantinople presided over the church in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire and its missionary activity that brought the Christian faith in its Byzantine form to many peoples north of the imperial borders. The cathedral church of Constantinople, Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), was the center of religious life in the eastern Christian world.

The Ecumenical Patriarchate came to be called the &quot;Great Church of Christ&quot; and it was the touchstone and reference point for ecclesiastical affairs in the East, whether in terms of church government, relations with the state, or liturgical matters.

====Prerogatives of the Ecumenical Patriarchate====
In history and in canonical literature (i.e. the Church&#x27;s canons and traditional commentaries on them), the Ecumenical Patriarchate has been granted certain prerogatives () that other autocephalous Orthodox churches do not have. Not all of these prerogatives are today universally acknowledged, though all do have precedents in history and canonical references. The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of these prerogatives and their reference points:

* Equal prerogatives to Old Rome (Canon 28 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Canon 36 of the Quinisext Council);
* The right to hear appeals, if invited, regarding disputes between clergy (Canons 9 and 17 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council);
* The right to ordain bishops for areas outside defined canonical boundaries (Canon 28 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council);
* The right to establish stavropegial monasteries even in the territories of other patriarchates (the Epanagoge, commentaries of Matthew Blastares and Theodore Balsamon)

===Iconoclast controversy===

In the eighth and ninth centuries the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images and ordered the destruction of an image of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act which was fiercely resisted by the citizens. Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: one source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a &quot;fruit store and aviary&quot;. Following the death of his son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress Theodora, who restored the icons.

===Great Schism of 1054===

The relations between the papacy and the Byzantine court were good in the years leading up to 1054. The emperor Constantine IX and the Pope Leo IX were allied through the mediation of the Lombard catepan of Italy, Argyrus, who had spent years in Constantinople, originally as a political prisoner.

Patriarch Michael I Cerularius ordered a letter to be written to John, the Bishop of Trani in which he attacked the &quot;Judaistic&quot; practices of the West, namely the use of unleavened bread. The letter was to be sent by John to all the bishops of the West, including the Pope. John promptly complied and the letter was passed to Humbert of Mourmoutiers, the cardinal-bishop of Silva Candida, who translated the letter into Latin and brought it to the Pope, who ordered a reply to be made to each charge and a defence of papal supremacy to be laid out in a response.

Although he was hot-headed, Michael was convinced to cool the debate and thus attempt to prevent the impending breach. However, Humbert and the pope made no concessions and the former was sent with legatine powers to the imperial capital to solve the questions raised once and for all. Humbert, Frederick of Lorraine, and Peter, Archbishop of Amalfi, arrived in April 1054 and were met with a hostile reception; they stormed out of the palace, leaving the papal response with Michael, who in turn was even more angered by their actions. The patriarch refused to recognise their authority or, practically, their existence. When Pope Leo died on April 19, 1054, the legates&#x27; authority legally ceased, but they effectively ignored this technicality.

In response to Michael&#x27;s refusal to address the issues at hand, the legatine mission took the extreme measure of entering the church of the Hagia Sophia during the Divine Liturgy and placing a bull of excommunication on the altar.

The events of the East-West Schism are generally dated from the acts of 1054. However, these events only triggered the beginning of the schism. The full schism was not actually consummated by the seemingly mutual excommunications. The New Catholic Encyclopedia reports that the legates had been careful not to intimate that the bull of excommunication implied a general excommunication of the Byzantine Church. The bull excommunicated only Cerularius, Leo of Achrida, and their adherents. Thus, the New Catholic Encyclopedia argues that the dispute need not have produced a permanent schism any more than excommunication of any &quot;contumacious bishop&quot;. The schism began to develop when all the other Eastern patriarchs supported Cerularius. According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, it was the support of Emperor Michael VI Stratiotikos that impelled them to support Cerularius. Some have questioned the validity of the bull on the grounds that Pope Leo IX had died at that time and so the authority of the legates to issue such a bull is unclear.

The legates left for Rome two days after issuing the bull of excommunication, leaving behind a city near riot. The patriarch had the immense support of the people against the emperor, who had supported the legates to his own detriment. To assuage popular anger, the bull was burnt, and the legates were anathematised. Only the legates were anathematised and, in this case too, there was no explicit indication that the entire Western church was being anathematised.

In the bull of excommunication issued against Patriarch Michael I Cerularius by the papal legates, one of the reasons cited was the alleged deletion by the Eastern Church of the &quot;Filioque&quot; from the original Nicene Creed. In fact, it was precisely the opposite: the Eastern Church had not deleted anything; it was the Western Church that had added this phrase to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.

As Bishop Kallistos Ware writes, &quot;Even after 1054 friendly relations between East and West continued. The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them. […] The dispute remained something of which ordinary Christians in East and West were largely unaware&quot;. In fact, efforts were made in subsequent centuries by Popes and Patriarchs to heal the rift between the churches. However, a number of factors and historical events worked to widen the separation over time.

===Fall of Constantinople in 1204 and the exile in Nicaea===

The Fourth Crusade in exchange for promised funds attempted to help the deposed emperor Alexius IV regain his throne. After taking Constantinople, returning Alexius IV to the throne, the revolt against and murder of Alexius IV left the Crusaders without payment. On 12 April 1204, the crusaders inflicted a severe sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders ruthlessly and systematically violated the city&#x27;s holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling, or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights.

Nicetas Choniates gives a vivid account of the sack of Constantinople by the Frankish and Venetian Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade:

:The Latin soldiery subjected the greatest city in Europe to an indescribable sack. For three days they murdered, raped, looted and destroyed on a scale which even the ancient Vandals and Goths would have found unbelievable. Constantinople had become a veritable museum of ancient and Byzantine art, an emporium of such incredible wealth that the Latins were astounded at the riches they found. Though the Venetians had an appreciation for the art which they discovered (they were themselves semi-Byzantines) and saved much of it, the French and others destroyed indiscriminately, halting to refresh themselves with wine, violation of nuns, and murder of Orthodox clerics. The Crusaders vented their hatred for the Greeks most spectacularly in the desecration of the greatest Church in Christendom. They smashed the silver iconostasis, the icons and the holy books of Hagia Sophia, and seated upon the patriarchal throne a whore who sang coarse songs as they drank wine from the Church&#x27;s holy vessels. The estrangement of East and West, which had proceeded over the centuries, culminated in the horrible massacre that accompanied the conquest of Constantinople. The Greeks were convinced that even the Turks, had they taken the city, would not have been as cruel as the Latin Christians. The defeat of Byzantium, already in a state of decline, accelerated political degeneration so that the Byzantines eventually became an easy prey to the Turks. The Crusading movement thus resulted, ultimately, in the victory of Islam, a result which was of course the exact opposite of its original intention.

Meanwhile, the Latin Empire of Constantinople was established, and Byzantine refugees founded their own successor states, the most notable of these being the Empire of Nicaea under Theodore Lascaris (a relative of Alexius III), the Empire of Trebizond, and the Despotate of Epirus.

The new seat of the Patriarchate was established in the city of Nicaea until in 1261, when Constantinople was reconquered by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.

=== Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and Ottoman period ===


In accordance with the traditional custom at the time, Sultan Mehmed II allowed his troops and his entourage three full days of unbridled pillage and looting in the city shortly after it was captured. Once the three days passed, he would then claim its remaining contents for himself. However, by the end of the first day, he proclaimed that the looting should cease as he felt profound sadness when he toured the looted and enslaved city. Hagia Sophia was not exempted from the pillage and looting and specifically became its focal point as the invaders believed it to contain the greatest treasures and valuables of the city. Shortly after the defence of the Walls of Constantinople collapsed and the Ottoman troops entered the city victoriously, the pillagers and looters made their way to the Hagia Sophia and battered down its doors before storming in.

Throughout the period of the siege of Constantinople, the trapped worshippers of the city participated in the Divine Liturgy and the Prayer of the Hours at the Hagia Sophia and the church formed a safe-haven and a refuge for many of those who were unable to contribute to the city&#x27;s defence, which comprised women, children, elderly, the sick and the wounded. Being trapped in the church, the many congregants and yet more refugees inside became spoils-of-war to be divided amongst the triumphant invaders. The building was desecrated and looted, with the helpless occupants who sought shelter within the church being enslaved. While most of the elderly and the infirm/wounded and sick were killed, and the remainder (mainly teenage males and young boys) were chained up and sold into slavery.

The women of Constantinople also suffered from rape at the hands of Ottoman forces. According to Barbaro, &quot;all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city&quot;. According to historian Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city&#x27;s civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes, and 30,000 civilians being enslaved or forcibly deported. George Sphrantzes says that people of both genders were raped inside Hagia Sophia.

After Constantinople was overrun by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the Patriarchate came to care more directly for all the Orthodox living in the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed II appointed Gennadius II of Constantinople as the Patriarch in 1454 and designated him as the spiritual leader as well as the ethnarch or, in Turkish, &quot;millet&quot; of all the Orthodox Christians in the Empire, regardless of ethnic origin; not only Greeks but also Bulgarians, Serbs, Albanians, Wallachians, Moldavians, Croatis, Syrians, orthodox Arabs, Georgians and Lazs came under the spiritual, administrative, fiscal, cultural and legal jurisdiction of the Patriarchate. Some of the other patriarchs came at various points to live permanently in Constantinople and function as part of the local church government. This situation, according to some of the Orientalists and historians, shows the &quot;Pax Ottomana&quot; (or &quot;Pax Ottomanica&quot;, literally &quot;the Ottoman Peace&quot;).

The Russian Orthodox Church, which for centuries had been a diocese of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, declared its independence in 1448 shortly before Constantinople fell owing to its protest over the Council of Florence, in which representatives of the patriarchate had signed onto union with Rome, trading doctrinal concessions for military aid against the encroaching Ottomans. The military aid never came and those concessions were subsequently repudiated by the patriarchate but, from 1448, the Russian church came to function independently as a council of Russian bishops elected their own metropolitan. After the fall of Constantinople to Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453, Moscow became the only independent Orthodox power and its leaders soon began to advance the claim that Moscow was the successor to the Byzantine Empire, calling it the &quot;third Rome&quot;. In 1589, 141 years later, Constantinople came to recognize Russia&#x27;s independence and led the Eastern Orthodox Church in declaring Russia also to be a patriarchate, numbering Moscow&#x27;s bishop as fifth in rank behind the ancient patriarchates. The Russian Orthodox Church became the largest of the Eastern Orthodox churches in the world.

As Ottoman rule weakened, various parts of the Orthodox Church that had been under the direct influence of the Ecumenical Patriarchate came to be independent. These churches at first usually declared their independence without universal approval, which came after Constantinople gave its blessing. The rate at which these new autocephalous (&quot;self-headed&quot;) churches came into being increased in the 19th century, particularly with the independence of Greece.

In 1833, the Church of Greece declared its autocephaly, which was subsequently recognized by the patriarchate in 1850. In 1865, the Romanian Orthodox Church, against the protests of Constantinople, declared its independence, which was acknowledged in 1885. A year before Greece&#x27;s autocephaly was self-proclaimed, the Serbian Orthodox Church was named autocephalous by the local secular government but Constantinople refused recognition until 1879. In 1860 the Bulgarians seceded from the Ecumenical Patriarchate; in 1870 the Bulgarian church was politically recognized as autonomous under the name Bulgarian Exarchate by the Sultan&#x27;s firman, but it was not until 1945 that it was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In 1922, the Albanian Orthodox Church declared its autocephaly, being granted recognition of it in 1937.

In addition to these churches, whose territory had been agreed upon by all as within Constantinople&#x27;s jurisdiction, several other disputed areas&#x27; Eastern Orthodox churches have had recognition by the Ecumenical Patriarchate as either autocephalous or autonomous, including the Finnish Orthodox Church and Estonian Orthodox Church in 1923, the Polish Orthodox Church in 1924, and the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church in 1998. The majority of these disputes are a result of the expansion of the Russian Empire, which often included a subjugation of the Orthodox churches in conquered lands to the Moscow Patriarchate. Due to this, the Moscow Patriarchate often disputes the Ecumenical Patriarch&#x27;s role as prime representative and spiritual leader of the world&#x27;s Orthodox Christians, citing that it represents the numerically largest Orthodox community.

==== Ecclesiastical buildings in Ottoman cities ====
As a ruling institution, the Ottoman Empire brought regulations on how the cities would be built (quality reassurances) and how the architecture (structural integrity, social needs, etc.) should be shaped. Special restrictions were imposed concerning the construction, renovation, size and usage of bells in churches. For example, in a town a church should not be larger in size than the largest mosque. Many churches were converted into mosques (among them the Hagia Sophia and Chora Church in Constantinople, and the Rotunda and Hagios Demetrios in Thessaloniki) or served for other uses (e.g. Hagia Irene in Constantinople, which became an armory for the Janissaries, and the Gül Mosque [Hagia Theodosia or Christ Euergetes], also in Constantinople, which after the Conquest served for a while as a naval dockyard). Such rules, however, although very strict in the beginning, with time and the increasing importance in the Ottoman Empire of the Rum millet were increasingly disregarded, so that in the 19th century in Istanbul there was a veritable building boom of Orthodox churches, many among them having high bell towers and brick domes, both of which had previously been strictly 

===Patriarchate under the secular Republic of Turkey===

Since 1586 the Ecumenical Patriarchate has had its headquarters in the Church of St George in the Fener (Phanar) district of Istanbul. The current territory of the Patriarchate is significantly reduced from what it was at its height. Its canonical territory currently includes most of modern Turkey, northern Greece and Mount Athos, the Dodecanese and Crete. By its interpretation of Canon 28 of Chalcedon, Constantinople also claims jurisdiction over all areas outside the canonically defined territories of other Orthodox churches, which includes the entire Western hemisphere, Oceania, the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia. This claim is disputed by other autocephalous churches with dioceses in those areas, as well as the Turkish government.

The Orthodox presence in Turkey itself is small; however the majority of Orthodox in North America (about two-thirds) are under the Ecumenical Patriarchate, primarily in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. The Patriarchate also enjoys an even greater majority in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the Albanian, Rusyn and Ukrainian jurisdictions in America are also part of the Patriarchate.

Most of the Patriarchate&#x27;s funding does not come directly from its member churches but rather from the government of Greece, due to an arrangement whereby the Patriarchate had transferred property it had owned to Greece. In exchange, the employees, including the clergy, of the Patriarchate are remunerated by the Greek government. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America provides substantial support through an annual contribution, known as the &quot;logia&quot;, and its institutions, including the American-based Greek Orthodox Ladies Philoptochos Society and the Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, usually important laymen who make large donations for the upkeep of the Patriarchate. In turn, they are granted honorary titles which once belonged to members of the Patriarchal staff in centuries past.

The Patriarchate acts in the capacity of being an intermediary and facilitator between the Orthodox churches and also in relations with other Christians and religions. This role sometimes brings the Patriarchate into conflict with other Orthodox churches, as its role in the church is debated. The question centers around whether the Ecumenical Patriarchate is simply the most honored among the Orthodox churches or whether it has any real authority or prerogatives () that differ from the other autocephalous churches. This dispute is often between Constantinople and Moscow, the largest Orthodox church in terms of population, especially as expressed in the Third Rome theory which places Moscow in the place of Constantinople as the center of world Orthodoxy. Such disputes sometimes result in temporary breaks in full communion, though usually not for very long.

The relationship between Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire was frequently bitter, due in no small part to the privilege given to Islam. requires by law that the Patriarch be a Turkish citizen by birth, which all Patriarchs have been since 1923all ethnic Greeks from the decreasing Greek minority of Turkey, which is causing a shortage of priests and consequently potential candidates for the post of Ecumenical Patriarch. The closing of the Orthodox Theological School of Halki is also a difficulty faced by the Patriarchate.

In 2024, after the protests from Turkey, the signature of the Ecumenical Patriarchate has been removed from the statement of the June 2024 Ukraine peace summit.

==Administration and structure==
===Holy Synod===
The affairs of the patriarchate are conducted by the Holy Synod, presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch. The synod has existed since some time prior to the fourth century and assists the patriarch in determining the affairs of the possessions under his jurisdiction. The synod first developed from what was referred to as the &quot;resident synod&quot;, composed of the patriarch, local bishops, and any Orthodox bishops who were visiting in the imperial capital of Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople, the synod&#x27;s membership became limited to bishops of the patriarchate.

The Holy and Sacred Synod, presided over by His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, is composed of twelve hierarchs, each serving a year-long term, with half of the synod&#x27;s members changing every six months in March and September.

The current members of the Holy and Sacred Synod serving from September 1, 2023 – February 29, 2024, are as follows:
* Panteleimon of Vryoula
* Evangelos of Sardis
* Cyril of Rhodes
* Ilarion of Winnipeg
* Evgenios of Crete
* Ambrosios of Korea
* Arsenios of Austria
* Job of Pisidia
* Apostolos of New Jersey
* Chrysostomos of Syme
* Prodromos of Rethymno and Avlopotamos
* Dimitrios of France

Notable hierarchs of the Ecumenical Patriarchate are the popular writer Kallistos (Timothy) Ware, an assistant-bishop in the Archdiocese of Thyateira and author of &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot;, the best-known introduction to the Orthodox Church in English, and John Zizioulas, Metropolitan of Pergamon, a well-known professor of systematic theology.

The right of non-Turkish members of the synod (from Northern Greece, the Dodecanese, America and Western Europe) to convene appears to be threatened by a recent declaration from the Istanbul Governor reported in the Freiburg archdiocesan magazine.

===Structure===

Head of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and of the Holy Synod is the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch and who since 1991 has been Bartholomew I (). The local churches of the Ecumenical Patriarchate consist of six archdioceses, 66 metropolises, 2 dioceses and one exarchate, each of which reports directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople with no intervening authority.

<text>Ralph Philip Klein (November 1, 1942 – March 29, 2013) was a Canadian politician and journalist who served as the 12th premier of Alberta and leader of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta from 1992 until his retirement in 2006. Klein also served as the 32nd mayor of Calgary from 1980 to 1989.

Ralph was born and mostly grew up in Calgary, Alberta. After dropping out of High School in grade 11, Klein joined the Royal Canadian Air Force reserves for one year and then attended the Calgary Business College. Klein later worked as a teacher and principal at the Calgary Business College, and later public relations with non-profits. After that, Klein became a prominent local journalist in Calgary where he reported on the challenges of the working class, social outcasts and First Nations, endearing himself to those groups. In 1980, Klein turned his attention to politics and as an underdog was elected Mayor of Calgary, where he oversaw the boom and bust of the oil industry in the 1980s, expansion of the CTrain, and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Klein resigned as Mayor in 1989 and turned his attention to provincial politics where he served as Environment Minister in the Cabinet of Don Getty for four years.

In 1992, Klein was elected as leader of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and went on to lead the party to a majority government in the 1993 Alberta general election; Klein continued the Progressive Conservative dynasty and won three more majority governments afterwards. Klein&#x27;s informal style endeared him to Albertans early in his term, and his political longevity and centralized management style earned him the nickname &quot;King Ralph&quot;. As premier, Klein oversaw a short period of drastic cuts to the public service and privatization of government services; this fiscal strategy ended in the late 1990s as rising oil and gas prices increased provincial tax revenues resulting in spending increases and paying down of the provincial government debt. Klein&#x27;s 14-year-long tenure as premier ended when the Alberta Progressive Conservatives&#x27; new leader, Ed Stelmach, assumed office on December 14, 2006.

==Early years==
Klein was born in Calgary, to Philip Andrew Klein (1917–2014) and Florence Jeanette Harper (1924–2004). His paternal grandparents were immigrants, from Germany and England, respectively. His father, Phil, was born in Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, grew up poor and rode the rails during the Great Depression in search of work. In the early 1940s he married Florence Harper, a waitress, and lived in her parents&#x27; basement in Calgary while trying to make ends meet working in construction. Ralph Klein&#x27;s parents separated when he was five or six years old and he spent time living with his maternal grandparents in the Calgary&#x27;s north end, and Rocky Mountain House with his mother. After separating from his mother, Klein&#x27;s father worked as a professional wrestler in the Alberta circuit for most of the 1950s using the name Phil &quot;The Killer&quot; Klein and later became a businessman.

Ralph Klein grew up in a working-class part of Calgary and dropped out of high school in grade 11, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force reserves, then completed high school later in life. Klein&#x27;s time in the Air Force was limited, returning home a year later shortly after his 18th birthday. Klein attended Calgary Business College studying accounting and business administration, and later served as a teacher and principal of the college. He later studied at Athabasca University. Following his role at the Calgary Business College, Klein took a position as a public relations official at the Southern Alberta district of the Red Cross and United Way&#x27;s offices in Calgary from 1963 to 1969.

Klein married Hilda May Hepner on April 29, 1961. They met at Portage-la-Prairie while Klein was training with the Air Force. As two strong willed individuals there were many difficulties in maintaining their relationship, and after several separations in the late-1960s and early-1970s, Klein and Hilda formally divorced on March 29, 1972, with adultery cited as the grounds for divorce. Hilda received custody of their two children. Klein remarried three months after his divorce to the Victoria-born Colleen Evelyn Hamilton, a single-mother with two children working as an accounting clerk with Imperial Oil and as a bartender by night. They were married in Colleen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s basement by Reverend Robert A. Simpson, and together Ralph and Colleen had one child.

==Journalism career==
Klein rose to public prominence in Calgary as a radio and television personality between 1969 and 1980. He was the Senior Civic Affairs reporter with CFCN-TV and CFCN radio. Klein built a reputation for thorough reporting and gritty, street-wise &quot;down and dirty&quot; reporter who could see through rhetoric. Klein&#x27;s reporting style left him ostracized from the journalist community and provoked jealousy amongst the CFCN news group. Klein routinely skipped morning assignment meetings, rarely checked in, yet still would still appear in the afternoon with a new story. During his early career Klein became a staple patron of the St. Louis Hotel bar in Calgary&#x27;s East Village, an area of synonymous with urban decay in the city.

Klein&#x27;s early civic affairs beat revolved around following newly elected anti-establishment Mayor Rod Sykes. The relationship between the Mayor Sykes and Klein could be described as fickle, Klein alerted the Mayor to a Calgary Police Service&#x27;s cannabis bust involving the Mayor&#x27;s 13-year-old son which Klein believed would involve planting the drugs on the minor. Klein also alerted Sykes about a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story on a proposed convention centre benefiting from city sources, which Sykes was able to temporarily delay, although Klein&#x27;s reasons were somewhat selfish as the CBC story would have been released before Klein&#x27;s story on the topic. Klein&#x27;s story &quot;The Marriage&quot; later resulted in invasion of privacy charges pressed against Klein and CFCN over the leak of a meeting recordings, the charges were subsequently thrown out of court.

The 1973 oil crisis created an economic boom in Calgary, and Klein reported on stories which emphasized the lower-class, outcasts and challenges faced by those who did not benefit from urban renewal. Among those challenges was the challenges faced by Chinese-Canadians and overcoming the negative public perceptions stemming from publicized drug sales, prostitution, and other anti-social behaviour taking place in Calgary&#x27;s Chinatown, through his work, Klein built strong relationships with the community and helped show a more accurate and generous view of the Chinese-Canadian community. Klein produced compelling and vivid stories about biker gangs which were both open and critical about the organizations, all the while building strong relationships by both living and partying with the gangs.

In 1977, CFCN news director Thompson MacDonald commissioned Klein to complete an investigative report on the Blackfoot people and their feelings about the 100th anniversary of Treaty Seven. Klein and a camera man left for Gleichen, Alberta and did not contact MacDonald for a long period of time, which while normal behaviour for Klein, was worrying for the news director. Klein finally made contact from jail after he was arrested by RCMP officers after a bar fight with a government official. Klein continued to work with members of the Blackfoot, who introduced him to the indigenous religion, and provided him with a spiritual advisor. The outcome of Klein&#x27;s reporting was a moving documentary highlighting the &quot;gap between white intentions and aboriginal realities...on reservations&quot;. Klein&#x27;s documentary focused on the poverty and difficulty of life, and interviewed grocery store owners who sold huge stockpiles of vanilla extract to desperate alcoholics at inflated prices. Although Klein valued his time living with the Blackfoot people, he rarely brought the experience up publicly, instead only sharing the elements outside the documentary with close friends and family. For his effort the Siksika christened Klein &quot;White Writer&quot; and called him a friend.

==Mayor of Calgary==
Klein grew dissatisfied with the direction of Calgary City Council, urban sprawl and Mayor Ross Alger&#x27;s proposed civic centre. The enormous proposed city centre required City Council to purchase properties in a five block radius, purchasing historic and small buildings one-by-one. Klein voiced his dissatisfaction through a monthly column in &quot;Calgary Magazine&quot;, his topics included his displeasure with the city&#x27;s heavy-handed &quot;block busting&quot; and expropriation tactics, the polluted state of the Bow River, transportation planning and the Ctrain, weakness of open government and freedom of information, but always ended his columns with a note of optimism and a challenge to his readers to think of how to improve the city. Through his articles, Klein was able to grab the attention of Calgary voters highlighting the issues they faced. Finally Klein was alerted by former Mayor Rod Sykes to a film crew and actor portraying a &quot;bum&quot; digging through garbage in a downtown alleyway, Klein rushed over and filmed the event. The film crew belonged to an advertising agency which admitted to producing an election television advertisement for incumbent Mayor Alger. Alger had previously noted his new &quot;civic centre&quot; would remove undesirable populations, and the CFCN report on the advertisement showed Alger as cynical and manipulative, eroding his support. Klein&#x27;s final documentary &quot;Dreams, Schemes and Sandstone Dust&quot; brought the human element to the civic centre debate, interviewing the bar regulars, hotel tenants and small business owners who were set to be bulldozed, creating a narrative that the areas historic but rundown buildings were worth preserving.

On August 20, shortly after the film crew incident and documentary, Klein uncharacteristically appeared at the morning CFCN news meeting and announced he would run for Mayor against Alger. Klein&#x27;s campaign started on rocky footing, he had little funds and limited knowledge of how to run a campaign or organize volunteers. He hired his friend Webster MacDonald, a lawyer, and labour organizer Ted Takacs to run co-manage his campaign, but neither was particularly adept. Finally he convened a group of 20 of his friends to discuss moving to the Alderman ticket, and after convincing Klein to continue to run for Mayor, they formed what became known as the &quot;Klein Gang&quot; a group of diehard supporters who remained with him throughout his political career. Shortly afterwards he opened his campaign office in a small space donated by local businessman Jack Singer and his campaign began to take off. It was in this office he first met Rod Love, a recent University of Calgary political science dropout. Love had initially offered to work for Alger&#x27;s campaign, but was not offered a position he was interested in. The Klein campaign continued to grow, although remained strained financially, with Klein only raising a total of $22,000. In the week before the election Klein&#x27;s public position improved as many estimated he was neck and neck with Alger, and ahead of the third candidate, Alderman Peter Petrasuk. Alger the incumbent had accumulated $150,000 for the election, had strong support in the Chamber of Commerce, and a clean name. His other opponent, Petrasuk was a prominent lawyer with a large ethnic voter base and significant fundraising capabilities. Klein sought an endorsement from former Mayor Sykes who still held considerable sway amongst voters, Sykes declined as he had previously promised the other candidates he would not endorse any candidate, but agreed to an interview which he would say that Klein stood a chance in the election. The final mayoral debate took place 36 hours before the polls opened, with Alger and Petrasuk battling over rising budgets while Klein ignored the topics and spoke of accountability, open government and making Calgarians proud of the city.

Klein&#x27;s victory on October 15, 1980, came as a shock to many in the city including his own father who refused to believe the news, and shortly afterwards Klein was installed as the 32nd Mayor of Calgary, and the second Mayor of Calgary to be born in the city. A day after the election the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; declared Klein &quot;&quot;The People&#x27;s Mayor&quot; in describing his &quot;stunning victory&quot;&quot;. Klein was subsequently re-elected twice, first in 1983 and again in 1986.

===Saddledome construction===
Klein began his term as mayor with a significant infrastructure project. The newly relocated Calgary Flames were moved to the city just as the city prepared a bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics. A stadium was necessary for both purposes and City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city&#x27;s new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the Victoria Park neighbourhood on the east end of downtown. Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of Airdrie were also considered.

The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city&#x27;s Olympic bid if necessary. City Council voted on March 3, 1981, to build the proposed 20,000-seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated &quot;The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary&#x27;s) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary&#x27;s commitment to hosting the Games&quot;.

===1988 Calgary Winter Olympics===

During his tenure he presided over the 1988 Winter Olympics, the first Canadian city to host the winter games. The 1988 Calgary bid proposed by the Canadian Olympic Association (COA), would spend nearly three times what the rival Vancouver group proposed. Ralph Klein and other civic leaders crisscrossed the world attempting to woo International Olympic Committee (IOC) delegates as the city competed against rival bids by Falun, Sweden and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy.

While the games were viewed as a success for Klein and the city of Calgary, it was not without its issues. Residents had been promised that only 10 percent of tickets would go to &quot;Olympic insiders&quot;, IOC officials and sponsors, but OCO&#x27;88 was later forced to admit that up to 50 percent of seats to top events had gone to insiders. The organizing committee, which was subsequently chastised by mayor Klein for running a &quot;closed shop&quot;, admitted that it had failed to properly communicate the obligations it had to supply IOC officials and sponsors with priority tickets. These events were preceded by OCO&#x27;88&#x27;s ticketing manager being charged with theft and fraud after he sent modified ticket request forms to Americans that asked them to pay in United States funds rather than Canadian and to return them to his company&#x27;s post office box rather than that of the organizing committee.

During the 1988 Olympics, Klein mistook the King of Norway Olav V for his driver, and asked that he fetch the car. Olav, who was startled, explained who he was as he pulled out his silver cigarette case, after which Klein bummed a cigarette from him.

===Light rail transit===

Klein oversaw the development of the Calgary&#x27;s light rail transit system (known as the Ctrain) which began operation on May 25, 1981, shortly after Klein&#x27;s first term began, and expanded as the city has increased in population. The system is operated by Calgary Transit, as part of the Calgary municipal government&#x27;s transportation department. The South Line was planned to extend to the northwest, political pressures led to the commission of the &quot;Northeast Line&quot;, running from Whitehorn station (at 36 Street NE and 39 Avenue NE) to the downtown core, with a new downtown terminal station for both lines at 10 Street SW, which opened on April 27, 1985. The &quot;Northwest Line&quot;, the extension of the South Line to the city&#x27;s northwest, was opened on September 17, 1987, in time for the 1988 Winter Olympics.

===National Energy Program===

The federal government under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau introduced the National Energy Program (NEP) which &quot;effectively imposed revenue-sharing burdens on oil and gas revenues in Alberta, in the October 1980 budget shortly after Klein took office as mayor of Calgary.

While he was mayor, the city enjoyed an economic boom. This was contrary to the 1980s global recession around the world. Calgary attracted many unskilled labourers from all over the country. 
Klein gained unfavourable national attention by blaming eastern &quot;creeps and bums&quot; for straining the city&#x27;s social services and police. 
Prior to entering provincial politics, Klein considered himself a Liberal Party supporter. He supported the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney in the 1988 federal election.

==Entry into provincial politics==
In 1988, Premier Don Getty approached Klein to run as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. Getty&#x27;s popularity waned as Alberta&#x27;s financial position deteriorated with dropping oil and gas prices, and he saw the popular Calgary Mayor as a valuable candidate. Klein demanded a Cabinet position in the Getty government, which Getty agreed to. Klein also received an offer from Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to join the federal Progressive Conservatives which included a cabinet appointment, but Klein&#x27;s wife Colleen was not receptive to the move.

Klein made the transition from municipal to provincial politics, and was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the riding of Calgary-Elbow in the 1989 general election. Klein won the election, defeating Liberal candidate and lawyer Gilbert Clark and two others with 49.6 per cent of the vote. He was subsequently named the Minister of Environment in Don Getty&#x27;s government, while the Premier lost the election in his home seat of Edmonton-Whitemud, had to wait two months to be elected to the &quot;safe&quot; Progressive Conservative district of Stettler.

As Minister of the Environment Klein&#x27;s accomplishments included the consolidation of environmental statutes, and the creation of the National Resources Conservation Board. In this role Klein earned a positive reputation amongst industry and some environmentalists. Klein also dealt with several high-profile controversial issues including the Oldman River Dam, Alberta Pacific pulp mill and Swan Hills Waste Treatment Plant.

===Progressive Conservative leadership bid===
Premier Don Getty knew that the Tories faced a general election in 1993, and Albertans support of the Progressive Conservatives was dropping. Getty inherited a government with no provincial debt, and ran average deficits of $2.6-billion per year, resulting in an $11-billion debt in 1993. With polls showing the Liberals far ahead, Getty support hovered around 30 per cent, and he decided to retire from politics in 1992. Under former Edmonton mayor Laurence Decore, the Liberals had made major gains by criticizing the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; fiscal responsibility, the province&#x27;s rapidly rising debt, and the government&#x27;s involvement in the private sector which had seen some companies defaulting on government loans.

The Progressive Conservative Association leadership selection rules changed prior to the 1992 convention, moving away from the caucus system to the &quot;one member, one vote&quot; system which required one candidate to get a plurality of votes. Party membership could be purchased and provide voting rights up to the close of the polls. Klein faced strong competition from Edmonton MLA and Minister of Health Nancy Betkowski, and seven other candidates. Klein campaigned for Progressive Conservative leadership in part by making arguments similar to Liberal leader Decore&#x27;s. He favoured a near-immediate balancing of the provincial budget and rapid debt repayment thereafter, and declared his government &quot;out of the business of business&quot;. Klein was criticized throughout the leadership campaign by reporters, politicians and other candidates for his hand&#x27;s off approach to governance and notability for partying. Leadership hopeful and Minister of Culture Doug Main was especially critical charging &quot;We can&#x27;t win this province back - we can&#x27;t be the government - with a smoking, drinking, paving, premier&quot;.

Klein came second in the first ballot on November 28, 1992, with 16,392 votes, one behind Betkowski. The second ballot occurred on December 5 with three candidates, Klein received an overwhelming majority with 46,245 votes (60 per cent) compared to Betkowski&#x27;s 31,722, and was elected leader of the Progressive Conservatives, and one week later was sworn in as the Premier of Alberta on December 14, 1992. Klein&#x27;s success at the leadership convention was a surprise to political observers, and occurred despite numerous endorsements from the Progressive Conservative caucus for Betkowski. Klein&#x27;s victory has been attributed to populist support from rural Albertans who purchased memberships between the first and second ballot.

==Premier==

Ralph Klein was appointed the 12th Premier of Alberta on December 14, 1992, following his surprising victory. The new government seeking a mandate three years into the 22nd Alberta Legislature began preparing for an election which was called seven months after Klein&#x27;s appointment as Premier on June 15, 1993. Many of Klein&#x27;s opponents in the Progressive Conservative leadership did not contest the 1993 election including Nancy Betkowski, John Oldring, Doug Main, and Rick Orman.

During the 1993 campaign Klein distanced himself from the Getty administration and highlighted the changes he had implemented during his short time as Premier. Decore, facing a Premier with whom he agreed on many issues, argued that the Progressive Conservative party had no moral authority left on the issues on which Klein was campaigning. The 1993 election was a success for Klein even with his party losing eight seats, dropping from 59 to 51. The Progressive Conservatives retained a majority government gaining 0.2 per cent of the popular vote from 1989, but still receiving less than 45 percent of the vote. His party captured all but two seats in Calgary, while being shut out of Edmonton entirely. Decore&#x27;s Liberals formed opposition with 32 seats and 40 per cent of the popular vote, while Ray Martin&#x27;s New Democrats lost all 16 seats and were shut out of the Legislature, although taking ten percent of he vote and being proportionally due eight or nine MLAs.

The 1993 election would end up being Klein&#x27;s least successful provincial election, with the 32 Liberals forming the largest opposition during Klein&#x27;s 12 years as Premier.

Klein&#x27;s 1997 election proved more successful, reaching a plurality of voters with 51 per cent of the popular vote and 63 seats in the Legislature, including two in Edmonton. Klein achieved his strongest government in 2001 election, winning 62 per cent of the popular vote and 74 of the 83 seats, the largest majority government since the Peter Lougheed era.

The 2001 election victory came against the new Liberal leader and former Progressive Conservative leadership challenger Nancy MacBeth (formerly Betkowski). Klein&#x27;s final election as Premier in 2004 saw the Progressive Conservative&#x27;s support drop, winning 62 seats with 47 per cent of the popular vote against Kevin Taft&#x27;s Liberal Party and Brian Mason&#x27;s NDP.

===The Alberta Advantage: Klein&#x27;s austerity campaign===
By the mid-1980s there was a worldwide oil glut, a serious surplus of crude oil, with the world price of oil dropping from over US$35 per barrel to below $10. The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries (due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in 1973 and 1979) and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; stated, &quot;the world temporarily floats in a glut of oil.&quot; By 1993, when Klein took office, Alberta&#x27;s debt had reached billion. Despite lower oil prices, Alberta was largely shielded from the early 1990s recession.

Klein&#x27;s premiership faced its first financial challenge with the MLA Pension Plan, with public outrage growing with the generous payments and &quot;double-dipping&quot; where former cabinet ministers were able to draw immediate pension payments while sitting as backbenchers. Klein attempted to defuse the issue by amending the plan, but when that didn&#x27;t satisfy the public, he eliminated the pension plan entirely, with MLAs moving to the same general public service pension plan, the bold action was unexpected and added to his credibility.

Balanced budgets and repayment of the provincial debt were significant long-term goals of Klein&#x27;s premiership. In 1993 Klein followed up on the 1991 government economic strategy paper &quot;Toward 2000 Together&quot; which was the basis of his 1993 provincial election with the Financial Review Committee whose 1993 report promised to balance the provincial budget by 1997 without raising taxes. The backbone of the economic plan was austerity, often called the &quot;Klein Revolution&quot;, or the &quot;Alberta Advantage&quot;, as Klein called it. The first priority was reduction of the provincial payroll, which led to the abolishment of more than 4,000 public service positions through amalgamation or elimination of government agencies. Another 1,800 government jobs were eliminated by the privatization of liquor retailers, and motor vehicle and property registration services. The 1994 budget required all departments to cut 20 per cent from their operating budgets and all public servants including Members of the Legislative Assembly, civil servants, teachers, nurses and university staff saw a 5 per cent pay cut and a two-year salary freeze. The Klein government initiated the sale of the provincial Crown Corporations and investments, including the public telephone company, AGT, alcohol sales, Alberta Energy Corporation, and provincial ownership stakes in other business entities. By 1995 owing to rising non-renewable resource revenue, corporate tax revenue and gambling taxes the Klein government had balanced the budget and eliminated the province&#x27;s deficit two years ahead of schedule, the cost was public spending dropping by $1.9-billion and more than 4,500 public service jobs had been abolished.

In the years following 1995 oil and natural gas prices continued to rise generating significant royalty revenue for the province. Klein&#x27;s new challenge was convincing the public to &quot;reinvest&quot; in recently cut public services while maintaining his fiscally conservative reputation. Government spending increased dramatically, rising 60 per cent between 1997 and 2001 which garnered rebuke from former administration allies such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and other conservative thinktanks. Klein sought to reinvent government in Alberta as a streamlined and efficient operation which heavily relied on privatization and contracting. Progressive Conservatives brought in Ted Gaebler the co-author of &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; and controversial former New Zealand Labour government Treasurer Roger Douglas to advise on the sweeping reforms.

At the 2004 Calgary Stampede, Klein announced that the province had set aside the necessary funds to repay its public debt in 2005.

From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under $25/barrel. A rebound in the price of oil worldwide led to big provincial surpluses in Alberta since the mid-1990. During 2004, the price of oil rose above $40, and then $50. A series of events led the price to exceed $60 by August 11, 2005, leading to a record-speed hike that reached $75 by the middle of 2006.

Political analyst David Taras of Mount Royal University argued that although Klein was popular, he failed at public policy. His focus on paying down Alberta&#x27;s fiscal debt during an oil boom - a time when interest rates on debt were low - was done &quot;at the expense of hospitals, roads, light rail transit lines, and investing in better health-care services or education.&quot; 
Rich Vivone, who was involved in Alberta politics from 1980 to 2005, claimed Klein &quot;had the trust and popularity to do almost anything he wanted and survive&quot; and his &quot;fiscal achievements early in his career were significant, but he &quot;utterly failed at health reform and economic diversification&quot; and he did &quot;little for culture, recreation or the arts.&quot;

===Prosperity Bonus===

In 2003, as the global price of oil increased Klein first contemplated government oil royalty payments to Albertans. The official announcement for the program came in September 2005, with each Albertan who filed a tax return received a &quot;Prosperity Bonus&quot;, known locally as &quot;Ralph Bucks&quot;. The program entailed a one-time $400 payment from the Government of Alberta in the form of a mailed cheque to each Alberta resident not in prison, at a cost of $1.4-billion. The Prosperity Bonus program was met with controversy, with critics claiming the funds would be better spent on infrastructure, health or education. Klein responded to the criticism saying if an Albertan did not want the cheque, they could &quot;send it back or donate it to charity&quot;, and defended the payment &quot;to some people it means a lot.&quot; ATB Financial&#x27;s Todd Hirsch observed, &quot;I think we missed some great opportunities to invest in our post-secondary education systems; instead, we frittered away our money. People got a couple of dinners and put some gas in their Hummer, and that was about it.&quot;

===Health Care===
Health care and funding were another significant policy objective for the Klein government. In 1994, the Klein government introduced the &quot;Regional Health Authorities Act&quot; to the 23rd Legislature which amalgamated the 204 hospital boards into 17 regional health authorities. The hospital boards were given significant autonomy to decide which hospitals would be closed or downgraded to the status of community clinics. This resulted in the closure of several urban hospitals including Calgary&#x27;s General Hospital demolished via implosion in 1998, and the closure of one other hospital in Calgary, and one in Edmonton. The number of acute care beds were halved in a period of three years and coverage of many medical services was reduced or eliminated.

In 2000, the Klein government introduced the &quot;Health Care Protection Act&quot; (Bill 11) to the 24th Alberta Legislature concerning partial privatization of healthcare evoked large protests at the Legislature. The bill allowed private for-profit clinics to perform minor surgeries and keep patients overnight, which had previously only been performed in hospitals. Klein blamed the two sitting NDP MLAs for fighting the reform, inciting the protests and forcing him to back away from the reform that he still supported. Federal Health Minister Allan Rock expressed his grave reservations over the legislation, but did not deem the &quot;Health Care Protection Act&quot; to violate the &quot;Canada Health Act&quot;.

The Klein government continued to search for efficiencies in health care, and in early 2002 the Premier&#x27;s Advisory Council on Health led by Don Mazankowski released its framework for reform report often referred to as the Mazankowski Report. The report included 43 recommendations the government fully accepted, including more choice, more private involvement, more competition and accountability, less comprehensiveness and increased user medicare co-payments for Alberta&#x27;s health care system. The direction of the Mazankowski Report towards privatization was expected, however, observers expected a much more radical report. The 2002 budget introduced a few months later raised medicare premiums, tobacco and liquor taxes, eliminated dental and optical subsidies for senior citizens, and also cut the corporate tax rate.

In July 2005 Klein delivered a speech on the &quot;third way&quot; of health care which would lie between the American system and the Canadian system. He proposed a series of provincial health care reforms that would potentially violate the Canada Health Act. Klein&#x27;s reforms for Alberta would have permitted for-profit care and made it possible to jump queues, to &quot;allow patients to pay cash for some surgery and let doctors practice in both the public and private health systems.&quot; Public outcry forced the government to listen to Albertans and the third way was not legislated.

Klein responded by exclaiming, &quot;I don&#x27;t need this crap&quot; and throwing the Liberal health care policy book at a seventeen-year-old page who had delivered the book during question period in the Alberta legislature. The same booklet later sold on eBay for a reported $1,400, signed by Alberta&#x27;s Liberal Leader Kevin Taft, with the caption, &quot;Policy on the fly&quot;. Earlier in the question period he also had to apologize for calling Liberal leader Kevin Taft a liar on the floor of the legislature, which is considered unparliamentary language. His apology consisted of saying, &quot;Sorry, Mr. Speaker. I won&#x27;t use the word &#x27;fib.&#x27; I&#x27;ll say that he doesn&#x27;t tell the whole truth all the time - most of the time.&quot;
Reacting to comments made in March 2006 by Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty opposing any two-tiered health care system in Ontario that Klein has proposed in Alberta which would allow quicker access to surgery for those who pay, Klein stated &quot;I&#x27;m no doctor, but I think that Mr. McGuinty&#x27;s got a case of premature speculation&quot;.

===Ralph Klein and the oil sands===
Calgary&#x27;s economy was so closely tied to the oil industry that the city&#x27;s boom peaked with the average annual price of oil in 1981. As the price of oil rose Alberta&#x27;s budget surplus stood at $4 billion in 2004. The province used this surplus to eliminate its $3-billion debt.

The subsequent drops in oil prices were cited by industry as reasons for a collapse in the oil industry and consequently the overall Calgary economy. Low oil prices prevented a full recovery until the 1990s.
Major investment incentives for oil sands companies were introduced by both the federal government under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and the provincial government under Klein. The Liberal federal government &quot;reformed and streamlined the tax write-offs it allowed for oil sands firms.&quot; Klein &quot;scrapped a welter of one-off royalty deals to create a generic royalty – one that demanded only token payments in the first years of the megaprojects.&quot; This facilitated oil sands development.

According to the Calgary Herald,

Klein changed Alberta&#x27;s royalty system so that oil companies paid only one per cent of their profits to Alberta until they recovered the cost of the project. The royalty rose to 25 per cent once the recovery cost was reached. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) claimed there was almost $4 billion coming from oil sands royalties in 2006.

In late June 2003, Klein and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney met to discuss the route of an Alaskan oil pipeline, which Klein argued had to be integrated with the extensive Alberta pipeline system. This was popular with Cheney and other advocates of North American energy independence in the oil industry.

At the end of Klein&#x27;s term one of the most common concerns &quot;was that Albertans were not getting enough money for their resources.&quot;

===Agriculture and forestry policy===
The Alberta agriculture industry faced significant challenges following the discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (also known as mad cow disease) in May 2003. The cow was inspected, found to be substandard and removed so that it would not be fed to animals or humans. The carcass was processed into oils and the head sent to the United Kingdom where the case of mad cow was confirmed. An investigation by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency resulted in the slaughter of 2,700 head of cattle. Exports of Canadian beef were halted by numerous countries immediately, most notably including the United States and Japan. Trade relations with the United States further deteriorated in December 2003 when a case of BSE was discovered in a cow imported from Canada to a farm near Yakima, Washington.

Klein&#x27;s response to BSE was highly criticized when he made a public statement &quot;I guess any self-respecting rancher would have shot, shovelled and shut up, but he didn&#x27;t do that,&quot; referring to the farmer in northern Alberta whose animal was found to have the disease when it was taken to a slaughterhouse. Exports of Canadian beef cattle had already been stopped at the U.S. border, with other countries already following suit. Japan had been a key stumbling block to getting the U.S. border reopened because it made clear it might rethink taking U.S. beef if it had Canadian beef mixed in with it. The United States eventually lifted restrictions on Canadian beef imports in stages, starting with cattle under 30 months of age in late-2003, then meat products in 2004, and later greater trade reductions in July 2005. Japan was slower to reopen trade with Canada, with the final BSE related restrictions on Canada beef lifted in 2019.

As part of economic diversification initiatives as Minister of Environment, Klein approved in December 1990 the construction of North America&#x27;s largest pulp mill by Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. The pulp mill was touted as the first in a new generation constructed to meet higher environmental standards put in place in the late 1980s. Alberta-Pacific received a loan of $264 million from the Alberta government through the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund in what Klein called a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot;. Against the advice of the Auditor General and the Provincial Treasurer on March 31, 1997, Klein wrote off all interest of the loan, totaling $140 million to the Alberta-Pacific Joint Venture when prices were low for pulp. Klein made national headlines during the announcement when he flipped off an environmental activist who was protesting the government&#x27;s the approval. Klein defended his actions by noting that it was the protester who made the offensive gesture first.

===Same-sex marriage===

In June 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario decision in &quot;Halpern v Canada (AG)&quot; which found the common law definition of marriage, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, violated section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Klein repeated a promise to use the Notwithstanding Clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to veto any requirement that the province register same-sex marriages, however the government recanted as legal scholars questioned whether the action have been constitutional. Contrary to many media reports which annoyed Klein, this was a position of the Alberta Legislature which passed the &quot;Marriage Amendment Act&quot; in March 2000 defining marriage exclusively as an opposite-sex union and attempted to insulate the decision by invoking the Notwithstanding Clause. In December 2004, Klein called for a national referendum on the issue of same-sex marriage. This plan was quickly rejected by the government of Paul Martin and by federal Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper.

Following the Parliament of Canada&#x27;s approval of same-sex marriage in 2005 via &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; (Bill C-38), Klein announced initially that his government would fight the distribution of same-sex marriage licences. However, he later recanted, stating publicly that there was no legal route to oppose the federal act (neither via the notwithstanding clause nor the province&#x27;s power over civil marriage), and the government reluctantly acknowledged the marriages officially on June 20, 2005.

===Law enforcement===
It was under Klein&#x27;s government that the Alberta Sheriffs Branch, was re-organized into its current state. The Klein government increasingly utilized CAPS, the precursor to the Sheriffs Branch, for special provincial law enforcement duties instead of the RCMP. In 2006, CAPS was renamed and the newly christened Sheriffs Branch was expanded rapidly to take on assignments that previously were the purview of the RCMP, the provincial policing authority. At this time, the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams were also created.

===Environment===
Klein&#x27;s social and environmental views were seen by opponents as uncaring. Supporters argued in response that Klein was merely choosing appropriate priorities for limited government funding.

Klein was opposed to the Kyoto Accord, since Alberta was a major producer of oil and natural gas, and he felt that environmental measures would hurt the economy. The successive government initiated a massive carbon-capture project.

At a 2002 fund-raiser Klein joked,
===Leadership review and retirement===
Prior to the 2004 election, Klein stated his intention to serve only one more term in office. Pressure mounted on Klein to set a firm date and, following such a request from party executive director Peter Elzinga, Klein announced on March 14, 2006, that he would be tendering his resignation on October 31, 2007. He later proposed that his resignation would take effect in early 2008 after a successor is chosen at the party&#x27;s leadership election.

Klein announced this timetable days before party delegates were to vote in a review of his leadership on March 31, 2006. The drawn-out schedule for his retirement, along with his announcement that any cabinet minister who wished to run for leader must resign by June 2006, generated a large degree of controversy, including criticism from cabinet minister Lyle Oberg who was subsequently fired from cabinet and suspended from caucus.

When the leadership review ballot was held on March 31, 2006, only 55 per cent of the delegates supported Klein. This was down from the 90 per cent level of support he had won at previous reviews and far lower than the 75 per cent Klein said he felt he needed in order to continue. The result was described as a &quot;crushing blow&quot; to Klein&#x27;s leadership.

Prior to the vote, Klein had said he would resign immediately if he did not win the leadership review by a &quot;substantial&quot; margin. In the hours following the vote, Klein released a statement thanking delegates for their support and saying he would take several days to consider his future.

At a press conference on April 4, 2006, Klein announced that as a result of the lukewarm vote for his continued leadership he would submit a letter in September to Alberta&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party urging it to convene a leadership contest. Klein said he would resign as party leader and premier after a successor was named, and would assist the new leader in their transition to premier.

Klein officially handed in his resignation as party leader on September 20, 2006, officially kicking off the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party leadership race. However, Klein remained premier until the new PC Leader, Ed Stelmach, assumed office on December 14, 2006.

Klein resigned his seat in the legislature on January 15, 2007.

==Later life==
On January 18, 2007, the law firm Borden Ladner Gervais announced that Klein, who is not a lawyer, would join their firm as a senior business adviser who would bring &quot;valuable insights to our clients as they look to do business in Alberta, in Canada, and in North America&quot;.

In a July 9, 2007, interview on Business News Network, Klein criticized Conservative PM Stephen Harper and Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty for their mishandling of the Income Trust issue and for not keeping their word on Income Trust taxation. According to the Canadian Association of Income Trust Investors, the change in tax rules cost investors $35 billion in market value. Stephen Harper specifically promised &quot;not to raid seniors&#x27; nest eggs&quot; during the 2006 federal election.

On March 27, 2008, Klein was created an Officer of the Order of the Legion of Honour by the Government of France. The creation had been approved by the Government of Canada on November 24, 2007.

On March 20, 2010, Klein appeared on his own television game show called &quot;On the Clock&quot; on the Crossroads Television System network. Klein, shown perched on a golden throne, evaluates the responses and awards &quot;Ralph Bucks&quot; to the contestants whose answers he found the best. The person who has the most Ralph Bucks at the end of the game is declared the winner.

==Illness and death==
On December 15, 2010, it was reported that Klein, a lifetime smoker, was suffering from COPD, a lung disease. His long-time friend Hal Walker commented that Klein was &quot;not well.&quot;

On April 8, 2011, it was reported that Klein was suffering from Pick&#x27;s disease, a form of progressive dementia.

Klein was hospitalized in September 2011 due to complications from COPD and dementia. He died in Calgary on March 29, 2013.

==Honours==
In September 2005 during the 22nd meeting of the American region of the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie in Alberta, Premier Ralph Klein and Speaker Kenneth Kowalski received the Order of La Pléiade, for individuals who have contributed to the promotion of the French language and culture in their respective jurisdictions. Klein would also be made an Officer of the Legion of Honour by France in 2008.

He received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, the Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005, The Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 and was appointed to the Alberta Order of Excellence in 2010.

Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from University of Calgary in 2011. and a member of the Order of Canada in late 2012.

In 1980, shortly after he was elected Mayor of Calgary, Klein was made an honorary Blackfoot Chief under the name &quot;Oots-squi-peeks&quot; meaning &quot;Blue Bird&quot;, one of only two to be honoured as such. Klein found the spiritualism inspiring and prepared mentally for provincial elections in sweat lodges, carried an eagle feather in his briefcase and hung sweetgrass braids in his office.

Ralph Klein Park in Calgary is the first park to be named for a former mayor during his lifetime. The site contains an Environmental Education Centre and man-made wetland to improve stormwater quality before it enters the Bow River system.

In a July 2014 poll of Albertans asking who the best Premier since 1985 is, 59% of respondents picked Ralph Klein.

==Controversies==
Ralph Klein was widely known for public mishaps and the inability for controversy or scandal to significantly weaken his public perceptions. Klein&#x27;s exploits while under the influence of alcohol were well known and publicized amongst Albertans and Canadians. Prior to his successful campaign for leadership of the Progressive Conservative Association, Klein was pressed by reporters and politicians on his drinking, leading &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; reporter Don Martin to quip &quot;&quot;Let&#x27;s face it. Klein&#x27;s liver has a busy reputation.&quot;, Klein responded to questions stating &quot;I like to party, yes. I&#x27;ve shared that with some of my colleagues that I enjoy a drink or two. But I can change. That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m going to totally quit.&quot;&quot;.

Klein was commonly spotted at casinos, with a preference for private card rooms, video lottery terminals and horse racing. Klein publicly admitted to having a &quot;borderline gambling addiction&quot; wagering hundreds on nights in the casino, having lost up to $7,000 in a single night.

In the late 1980s Klein was photographed in a Calgary bar drinking with two members of the Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club, later to be patched over to the Hells Angels. Years later, this photo was used against him by the Hells Angels when he objected to them patching over two motorcycle clubs in Alberta and promised greater funding to police in 1997.

Klein had numerous run-ins with protesters throughout his political career, including a December 1990 incident where Klein was photographed giving the finger to a protester at a news conference called to announce the approval of the controversial $1.6-billion Alberta Pacific pulp mill project in Athabasca, and the July 2003 incident where Klein was the recipient of a pieing at the annual Premier&#x27;s Stampede Breakfast in Calgary.

In April 1994, Klein commented on the that a youth court judge who had suggested he would not sit in order to protest proposed reductions to provincial court justice salaries should be &quot;very, very quickly fired&quot; was brought before the Supreme Court of Canada in the &quot;Provincial Judges Reference&quot; (1997) for raising concerns about judicial independence. The court merely said the comment was &quot;unfortunate.&quot;

Public opinion regarding Klein&#x27;s alcohol consumption reached a boiling point in December 2001 when he visited the Herb Jamieson Centre, a 249-bed homeless shelter in Edmonton while intoxicated. An argument ensued between Klein and homeless men sleeping in the hallway who were denied a bed because they had been drinking. During the argument Klein told the men to get a job, which was rebuked by some of the men who stated they had jobs but could still not afford housing. An argumentative Klein was shuffled out of the centre while he tossed money at a homeless man on the way out. According to biographer Don Martin, Klein continued with his normal schedule in the following days, and when rumors of the event began to pop-up amongst the media, Klein was unable to remember the event. After the event Klein called a press conference and emotionally acknowledged he had an alcohol problem and pledged to curb or stop his drinking. He called alcohol &quot;the devil&quot; and an &quot;awful beast&quot;, but did not go as far as acknowledging he suffered from alcoholism. Klein admitted to being intoxicated at many moments in his life, visibly during his 2001 general election party, a month earlier when he introduced former US President Bill Clinton, and at the public memorial for Calgary sportscasting legend Ed Whalen.

In February 2006, the &quot;Western Standard&quot; magazine came under fire for printing comments about Klein&#x27;s wife Colleen Klein, who is Métis. A column by Ric Dolphin, arguing that Colleen Klein has too much influence over her husband, quoted an unnamed source who said &quot;Once she stops being the premier&#x27;s wife, she goes back to being just another Indian.&quot;

During a charity roast on November 9, 2006, Klein made a lewd joke at the expense of former Conservative Member of Parliament Belinda Stronach: &quot;Belinda roasted me as a Conservative, but of course now she&#x27;s a Liberal.. and I wasn&#x27;t surprised that she crossed over; I don&#x27;t think she ever did have a Conservative bone in her body.. well, except for one.&quot; (Referring to Peter MacKay, her former boyfriend, who is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.) Klein refused to apologize for the remark stating that &quot;a roast is a roast is a roast is a roast&quot;, while his spokesman pointed out that &quot;Ms. Stronach roasted the premier two years ago and made remarks about his weight, his clothing and even his flatulence&quot;.

<text>Agnetha Åse Fältskog (born 5 April 1950), known as Agnetha Fältskog () and Anna Fältskog, is a Swedish singer, songwriter, and a former member of the pop group ABBA. She first achieved success in Sweden with the release of her 1968 self-titled debut album. She rose to international stardom in the 1970s as a member of ABBA, which is one of the best-selling music acts in history. She is the youngest member of ABBA, and the only one born in the 1950s.

After the unofficial break-up of ABBA in December 1982, she renewed success later in the decade as a solo artist with three albums and a leading role in a movie. She became reclusive in the 1990s, avoiding outside publicity and residing on the Stockholm County island of Ekerö.

Fältskog stopped recording music for 16 years until she released a new album, &quot;My Colouring Book&quot;, in 2004. She returned in 2013 with &quot;A&quot;, her highest UK charting solo album to date. ABBA has since reformed, and Fältskog has resumed her previous role with the group.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Agneta Åse Fältskog was born in Jönköping on 5 April 1950. She was the first of two daughters of department store manager Knut Ingvar Fältskog (1922–1995) and his wife Birgit Margareta Johansson (1923–1994). Ingvar showed much interest in music and show business, and Birgit devoted herself to her children and household. Fältskog&#x27;s younger sister, Mona, was born in 1955.

Fältskog wrote her first song at the age of six, titled &quot;Två små troll&quot; (&quot;Two Small Trolls&quot;). In 1958, she began taking piano lessons, and also sang in a local church choir. In early 1960, Fältskog formed a musical trio, the Cambers, with her friends Lena Johansson and Elisabeth Strub. They performed locally in minor venues but soon dissolved due to lack of work. Fältskog&#x27;s first professional engagement came after she was taken on by a local dance band at the age of 15, following which she left school and worked as a telephonist whilst also performing with the band.

Fältskog cites Connie Francis, Marianne Faithfull, Aretha Franklin and Lesley Gore as her strongest musical influences.

===Career development in Sweden (1966–1971)===

For two years Fältskog continued singing with the Bernt Enghardt band, and as its popularity grew, decided to give up her other job when combining both careers proved physically too demanding. During that time, Fältskog broke up with her boyfriend Björn Lilja; this event inspired her to write a song, &quot;Jag var så kär&quot; (&quot;I Was So in Love&quot;), that soon brought her to media prominence.

At that time, Karl Gerhard Lundkvist, a relative of one of the band&#x27;s members, retired from his successful rock and roll career and began working as a record producer at Cupol Records. Enghardt sent him a demo recording of the band, but Lundkvist only showed interest in Fältskog and her song. She was worried because he was not interested in the band, and they were not to be included on the record. However, she decided to accept the offer and signed a recording contract with Cupol Records.

Her self-penned début single &quot;Jag var så kär&quot; was recorded on 16 October 1967 and released through Cupol Records the following month. It topped the Swedish Chart on 28 January 1968 and sold more than 80,000 copies. The second single, her self-penned &quot;Utan dig&quot; (Without you) was also a big hit and so was her third single from 1968 &quot;Allting har förändrat sig&quot; (Everything has changed). She also submitted the song &quot;Försonade&quot; (&quot;Reconciled&quot;) to Melodifestivalen, the Swedish preliminary for the Eurovision Song Contest, but it was not selected for the final. Fältskog developed a career as one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular pop music artists, participating in a television special about Swedish composer Jules Sylvain in 1969. The same year, she released the single &quot;Zigenarvän&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Friend&quot;) about a young girl attending a Gypsy wedding and falling in love with the bride&#x27;s brother. Its release coincided with a heated debate about Gypsies in the Swedish media, and Fältskog was accused of deliberately trying to make money out of the situation by writing the song.

Fältskog&#x27;s success continued throughout the late 1960s. She met German songwriter/producer Dieter Zimmermann, to whom she became engaged. Her albums thus reached the German charts, and Zimmermann promised she would achieve great success in Germany. However, when she went there and met with record producers, the venture was not productive; Fältskog refused to meet the demands of the producers, describing their chosen material as &quot;horrible&quot;. She soon ended her engagement to Zimmermann and returned to Sweden.

In 1970, she released &quot;Om tårar vore guld&quot; (&quot;If Tears Were Gold&quot;). The Danish composer Per Hviid claimed that she used 22 bars from his composition &quot;Tema&quot; (&quot;Theme&quot;), although it was written in the 1950s and had never been recorded. The case dragged on until 1977 when a settlement was reached and Fältskog paid the Danish musician SEK 5,000,000.

In 1972, Fältskog portrayed Mary Magdalene in the Swedish production of the international hit musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

===First marriage and years with ABBA (1971–1982)===

Fältskog met Björn Ulvaeus, a member of the Hootenanny Singers, for the first time in 1968 and then again in 1969. Her relationship with Ulvaeus, as well as her friendship with Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson, with whom Ulvaeus had already written songs, eventually led to the formation of ABBA. Fältskog and Ulvaeus married on 6 July 1971 in the village of Verum, with Andersson playing the organ at their wedding. Their first child, Linda Elin Ulvaeus, was born on 23 February 1973, and their son Peter Christian Ulvaeus on 4 December 1977. After seven years of marriage, the couple decided to separate in late 1978 and filed for divorce in January 1979. The divorce was finalised in July 1980. Both Fältskog and Ulvaeus agreed not to let their failed marriage interfere with their responsibilities with ABBA. The failure of their marriage inspired Ulvaeus to write the lyrics of &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;.
As a member of ABBA, Fältskog was also known as &quot;Anna&quot; in some countries.

In 1975, during the same period as her bandmate Anni-Frid Lyngstad recorded her Swedish number one album &quot;Frida ensam&quot;, Fältskog recorded and produced her solo album &quot;Elva kvinnor i ett hus&quot;. These albums were both recorded between sessions and promotion for the ABBA albums &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;ABBA&quot;. Fältskog&#x27;s album spent 53 weeks on the Swedish album chart (longer than any of ABBA&#x27;s albums), but failed to reach the Top 10, peaking at No.11. It contained three further Svensktoppen entries for Fältskog: her Swedish-language version of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;SOS&quot; (also No. 4 on the single sales chart); &quot;Tack För En Underbar Vanlig Dag&quot;; and &quot;Doktorn!&quot;. Except for &quot;SOS&quot;, all the songs had lyrics by Bosse Carlgren and music by Fältskog herself. The creation of the album had been underway since 1972 when Fältskog started writing the songs, but it was delayed because of the work with ABBA and her pregnancy.

In 1974, Fältskog and Carlgren agreed on a concept for the album; it should consist of 12 songs, each sung by 12 female characters living in the same apartment building. However, in the end, only 11 songs were featured on the album, and the concept was not fully developed. Fältskog possesses a soprano voice and her range expands from D3 to E♭6.
Between the years 1968 and 1980, Fältskog had a total of 18 entries on the Svensktoppen radio chart, starting with the debut single &quot;Jag var så kär&quot; in January 1968 (peak position No. 1) and ending with &quot;När du tar mig i din famn&quot; (&quot;When You Take Me in Your Arms&quot;) from the compilation &quot;Tio år med Agnetha&quot; in January 1980 (peak position No. 1). These 18 entries, most of which were composed or co-written by Fältskog herself, spent a total of 139 weeks on the chart during this time, with the biggest hit being 1970&#x27;s &quot;Om tårar vore guld&quot; (No. 1, 15 weeks).

Fältskog also recorded the Swedish Christmas album &quot;Nu tändas tusen juleljus&quot; with daughter Linda Ulvaeus which peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in December 1981.

Fältskog participated in Melodifestivalen again, albeit only as a composer. In 1981, she wrote the ballad &quot;Men natten är vår&quot; (&quot;But the Night Is Ours&quot;) with lyrics by Ingela Forsman, but instead of performing the song in the contest herself, she chose new talent Kicki Moberg. The song placed 9th out of 10. The single, which Fältskog produced in the Polar Studios with the same musicians as on contemporary ABBA recordings, was backed with the Swedish version of &quot;I&#x27;m Still Alive&quot;, entitled &quot;Här är mitt liv&quot; (&quot;Here Is My Life&quot;), a song which she herself had performed in its English version (lyrics by ex-husband Björn Ulvaeus) during ABBA&#x27;s 1979 world tour.

Moberg&#x27;s recording of the song remains the only version to have been officially released to date.

Fältskog sang solo parts in the following ABBA songs: &quot;Disillusion&quot; (the only ABBA song to have been written by her, lyrics by Björn), &quot;I Am Just A Girl&quot;, &quot;Hasta Mañana&quot;, &quot;Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)&quot;, &quot;SOS&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Waiting For You&quot;, &quot;When I Kissed the Teacher&quot;, &quot;My Love, My Life&quot;, &quot;Take A Chance On Me&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;Move On&quot;, &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot;, &quot;Get on the Carousel&quot;, &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, &quot;Lovelight&quot;, &quot;As Good As New&quot;, &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for the Nights&quot;, &quot;Kisses Of Fire&quot;, &quot;Dream World&quot;, &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot;, &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;, &quot;Happy New Year&quot;, &quot;Lay All Your Love On Me&quot;, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, &quot;One of Us&quot;, &quot;Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot;, &quot;Just Like That&quot; (never officially released in its entirety by the group), &quot;I Am The City&quot;, &quot;Under Attack&quot;, &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Shut Me Down&quot;, &quot;I Can Be That Woman&quot; and &quot;Keep an Eye on Dan&quot;.

===Solo career development (1982–1988)===
Although no official announcement was made, ABBA effectively disbanded in late 1982 to early 1983. At the end of 1982, Fältskog duetted with Swedish singer (and former ABBA backing vocalist) Tomas Ledin on a song called &quot;Never Again&quot;, which became a Top Five hit in Sweden, and Top 10 in Norway, Belgium, and Finland. The song was also released in a Spanish-language version, entitled &quot;Ya Nunca Más&quot;. In the summer of the same year, Fältskog had a leading role in the Swedish movie &quot;Raskenstam&quot;.

In May 1983, Fältskog released her first post-ABBA solo album, &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot;, produced by Mike Chapman. The album became a moderate hit in North America and Australia but reached the higher regions of the charts across Europe, including No. 1 in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark (where it became the biggest-selling album of the year), top 5 in Germany, The Netherlands and No. 18 in the UK. The album achieved sales of 1.5 million copies in the first year. Two singles from the album became hits in continental Europe: &quot;The Heat Is On&quot; became a No. 1 hit in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Belgium and No. 2 in The Netherlands and Germany. The song peaked at No. 35 in the UK (and was Fältskog&#x27;s highest charting and only UK Top 40 hit until 2004). The album&#x27;s title track reached No. 1 in Belgium and peaked at No. 4 in the Netherlands. In North America, the album track &quot;Can&#x27;t Shake Loose&quot; was released as the lead-off single, reaching No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and No. 23 on the RPM Top 50 singles chart in Canada.

Fältskog&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Eyes of a Woman&quot;, produced by Eric Stewart of 10cc, was released in March 1985. &quot;She is quite content to grace the works of various other lesser mortals with her immaculate, sugar-sweet voice,&quot; wrote Barry McIlheney in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The album sold well in parts of Europe, peaking at No. 2 in Sweden and reaching the Top 20 in Norway and Belgium, but scraped into the UK Top 40 just for one week. The album sold up to 800,000 copies. The self-penned lead single &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; achieved moderate success in Europe, reaching No. 6 in Sweden, No. 18 in the Netherlands and No. 24 in West Germany.

In 1986, Fältskog recorded another duet, &quot;The Way You Are&quot;, with Swedish singer Ola Håkansson, which became another No. 1 hit in Sweden, Norway and Brazil.

In early 1987, Fältskog recorded the album &quot;Kom följ med i vår karusell&quot; (&#x27;Come Join Us On Our Carousel&#x27;) with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. Agnetha recorded duets with her son and a children&#x27;s choir for the album. In 1988, it was nominated for the Swedish music prize Grammis in the category &#x27;Barn&#x27; (For Children).

In the summer of 1987, Fältskog travelled to Malibu, California to record her fourth post-ABBA solo album, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, produced by Peter Cetera (formerly of the band Chicago) and Bruce Gaitsch, who had collaborated on Madonna&#x27;s &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. Released in November of that year, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; was a minor hit in Europe, except in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 1988. More than 300,000 copies were sold throughout Scandinavia. According to Hans Englund, the Swedish head of WEA, more than 800,000 copies were sold globally. However, chart-wise outside of Scandinavia, the results were less impressive.

The single &quot;I Wasn&#x27;t the One (Who Said Goodbye)&quot;, on which Fältskog duetted with Peter Cetera, was released primarily in North America, and became her second solo single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 93. It was also a Top 20 &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary hit. The track (along with &quot;The Last Time&quot; as &quot;La Última Vez&quot;) was also recorded in Spanish for the Latin American market as &quot;Yo No Fui Quién Dijo Adiós&quot;. Fältskog refused to promote the album in major TV shows in West Germany, but she made a promotional visit to London in February 1988, appearing on the &quot;Terry Wogan Show&quot;.

===Hiatus from recording (1988–2004)===
Following the release of &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, Fältskog had a 17-year hiatus from the music industry, during which she made few public appearances and devoted much of her time to astrology, yoga and horse back riding at her isolated country house in Ekerö.

In 1990, Fältskog married Swedish surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld, but the couple divorced in 1993.

In 1994, Fältskog&#x27;s mother died by suicide by jumping from her Jönköping apartment balcony. Fältskog&#x27;s resulting depression worsened a year later when her father died.

In 1997, Fältskog started a relationship with a Dutch forklift driver, Gert van der Graaf. After Fältskog decided to terminate the relationship in 1999, he stalked her further at her mansion, resulting in a court issuing Van der Graaf with a restraining order and deporting him to the Netherlands in 2000. Returning close to her home in 2003, he was arrested and then banned from entering Sweden. In 2005, the ban order from Sweden ran out, and within months Van der Graaf was again sighted near Fältskog&#x27;s estate in Ekerö.

In 1996, her autobiography &quot;Som jag är&quot; was published in Swedish (and in English the following year titled &quot;As I Am&quot;), followed by several compilation CDs of her Swedish and English recordings, including one called &quot;My Love, My Life&quot; for which Fältskog picked out the music herself. Fans welcomed the autobiography. The book was updated in 1998 and released worldwide via Virgin Publishing, selling over 50,000 copies.

===Return to music and selected public appearances (2004–2010)===

In April 2004, Fältskog released a new single, &quot;If I Thought You&#x27;d Ever Change Your Mind&quot; (a cover of the song originally recorded by Cilla Black). It peaked at No. 2 in Sweden and became Fältskog&#x27;s highest charting UK single to date, reaching No.11. One week later, the album &quot;My Colouring Book&quot;, a collection of Fältskog&#x27;s covers of 1960s classic oldies, was released, topping the chart in Sweden, reaching the top 5 in Finland and Denmark, and peaking at No. 6 and No. 12 in Germany and the UK respectively. 

The title track, &quot;My Colouring Book&quot;, is a cover of the song originally recorded by Barbra Streisand. &quot;The Observer&quot; suggested that &quot;time hasn&#x27;t diminished her perfect voice.&quot; Reviewing the release in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan wrote: &quot;Agnetha Fältskog has a vulnerability that gets under the skin of a song. She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but if anyone can do justice to the likes of &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, it&#x27;s her. The soaring sentimentality evokes Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don&#x27;t say that lightly.&quot; The release attracted media attention across Europe, but Fältskog staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album.

A second single release from the album, &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, peaked at No.11 in Sweden and entered the UK Top 40 at No. 34 (which was still higher than any of her UK singles in the 1980s). &quot;Sometimes When I&#x27;m Dreaming&quot;, originally recorded by Art Garfunkel, failed to be released as the third single.

Shortly after this release, for the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, Fältskog appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video&quot;. All four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did the singer and actress Cher and comedian Rik Mayall.

In 2004, Fältskog was nominated for &quot;Best Nordic Artist&quot; at the Nordic Music Awards, and at Christmas of that year, she gave an extensive interview (her first in many years) filmed by Swedish TV. Around the same time, Sony Music released a lavishly produced 6-CD boxed set comprising Fältskog&#x27;s Swedish solo career (mostly before ABBA), with five original solo albums: 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and her 1975 album recorded and released during her time with ABBA – plus an additional compilation disc with bonus tracks.

In 2005, Fältskog appeared with her former bandmates at the opening of the &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; musical in Stockholm, and together with ex-husband Björn, also attended the final show in January 2007.

In October 2008, a new compilation album, &quot;My Very Best&quot;, was released in Sweden. The double CD contains Swedish (CD 1) and English-language hits (CD 2) from her solo career from 1967 to 2004. It reached No. 4 on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold within its first week of release.

On 4 July 2008, Fältskog joined her former bandmates at the Swedish premiere of the film version of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, held at the Rival Theatre (owned by Andersson) in Mariatorget, Stockholm. Fältskog arrived with Lyngstad and movie star Meryl Streep, the three dancing in front of thousands of fans before joining the film&#x27;s other stars and Andersson and Ulvaeus on the hotel balcony for the first photograph of all four ABBA members together in 22 years.

In January 2009, Fältskog appeared onstage with Lyngstad at the Swedish Rockbjörnen Awards to receive a lifetime honorary award for ABBA.

In February 2010, ABBA World, an extensive multimillion-Pound (in monetary value) exhibition, debuted at London&#x27;s Earls Court and included an extensive interview with Fältskog filmed in Sweden the previous summer. For the exhibition&#x27;s Melbourne launch, she recorded a light-hearted opening film together with former ABBA colleague Benny Andersson, shot in Stockholm in June 2010.

In October 2010, Fältskog attended the opening of the &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; musical in Denmark with former husband, Björn Ulvaeus.

===&quot;A&quot;, &quot;ABBA Voyage&quot; and &quot;A+&quot; (2013–present)===
In May 2013, Fältskog released a new album called &quot;A&quot;, produced by Jörgen Elofsson and Peter Nordahl. In the UK, the first single, &quot;When You Really Loved Someone&quot;, had previously been released for download on 11 March, with the accompanying video also released on the same day. In Germany, the first single was &quot;The One Who Loves You Now&quot;, and it was also released for download on 11 March 2013. The album includes a duet with Gary Barlow of Take That, called &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Followed You Home&quot;. 

In June 2013, officials from Universal Records in the Netherlands said 600,000 copies of &quot;A&quot; were sold in the first two months after its release. The album managed Top 5 placings in many territories, including Sweden, Norway, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, New Zealand and Australia. It charted at No. 6 in the United Kingdom (her highest ever placing in that territory). A few weeks after its release, a TV special made by the BBC helped the album reach the No. 6 position in the UK album chart for a second time. The first single from the album to be released in the US, &quot;Dance Your Pain Away&quot;, was released on 28 May 2013. The digital single included two new mixes by Smash Mode. &quot;Dance Your Pain Away&quot; was released internationally as a single on 15 July 2013.

On 17 May 2013, Fältskog was awarded the SKAP 2013 Kai Gullmar Memorial Award at the Stockholm release party for &quot;A&quot;. On 12 November 2013, Fältskog sang live on stage for the first time in 25 years at the BBC Children in Need Rocks 2013 concert in London; she sang a duet with Gary Barlow, the organiser of the event, performing the single &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Followed You Home&quot; from Agnetha&#x27;s album &#x27;A&#x27;. On 18 November 2013, to promote the song, a video for &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Followed You Home&quot; was shot the same day as the single release. Although the single was released in most countries in November 2013, its release in the United Kingdom was held over. She also won Best Female Album – 6th Annual Scandipop 2014 and was nominated for the German 2014 ECHO award in the Artist Rock/Pop International category.

In April 2016, a new biography of Fältskog by Daniel Ward, &quot;Agnetha Fältskog – The Girl with the Golden Hair&quot;, was published in the UK.

In the summer of 2017, Faltskög joined her ABBA bandmates Frida Lyngstad, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to record two new songs, &quot;I Still Have Faith in You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shut Me Down&quot;. These songs were meant to be part of an ABBA-themed TV special that was eventually discarded and replaced by the more ambitious, digital-laden Voyage show.

On 2 September 2021, via YouTube Livestream, ABBA announced their upcoming virtual concert residency &quot;ABBA Voyage&quot;, as well as the imminent release of an eponymous album, recorded between 2017 and 2021. The new record, their first studio album in 40 years, features ten tracks, including &quot;I Still Have Faith In You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shut Me Down&quot;, which were first shown in the aforementioned Livestream event and released as a double A-side single. On 5 November 2021, the &quot;Voyage&quot; album was released worldwide. On 27 May 2022, ABBA Voyage opened in a purpose-built venue named the ABBA Arena at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London.

Fältskog&#x27;s official social media sources were updated on 23 August 2023 hinting at a new album/single called &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;. The new song was released on 31 August 2023, and had its radio premiere on Zoe Ball&#x27;s Breakfast show on BBC Radio 2. Her album called &quot;A+&quot;, released on 13 October 2023, was also announced.

==Personal life==

On 6 July 1971, Fältskog married Björn Ulvaeus. They had two children: Linda Elin Ulvaeus (born 23 February 1973) and Peter Christian Ulvaeus (born 4 December 1977). The couple announced their separation in January 1979, and their divorce was finalised in July 1980. Fältskog remarried to Swedish surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld in 1990, but they divorced in 1993.

Fältskog&#x27;s split from Ulvaeus in 1979 greatly affected her, and she needed therapy afterwards. Her mother&#x27;s suicide in 1994 and her father&#x27;s death the following year were also kept private.

Fältskog currently lives in Ekerö, Stockholm County. She has four grandchildren.

Fältskog had a fear of flying, which worsened during ABBA&#x27;s 1979 American tour, when the band&#x27;s plane, heading to Boston, Massachusetts, was short of fuel, hit a tornado and performed an emergency landing. Fältskog said in 2013 that she needed therapy to deal with the fear. During her solo career years, Fältskog would always travel by bus and was in a bus accident on a Swedish motorway in 1983.

On 21 March 2024, all four members of ABBA were appointed &quot;Commander, First Class, of the Royal Order of Vasa&quot; by His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. This was the first time in almost 50 years that the Swedish Royal Orders of Knighthood was bestowed on Swedes, also the 50th anniversary of ABBA winning the Eurovision Song Contest. ABBA shared the honour with nine other persons.

<text>In Unix-like and some other operating systems, the codice_1 command (&quot;print working directory&quot;) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.

==Implementations==
Multics had a codice_2 command (which was a short name of the codice_3 command) from which the Unix pwd command originated. The command is a shell builtin in most Unix shells such as Bourne shell, ash, bash, ksh, and zsh. It can be implemented easily with the POSIX C functions codice_4 or codice_5.

It is also available in the operating systems SpartaDOS X, PANOS, and KolibriOS. The equivalent on DOS (codice_6) and Microsoft Windows (codice_7) is the codice_8 command with no arguments. Windows PowerShell provides the equivalent codice_9 cmdlet with the standard aliases codice_10 and codice_2.
On Windows CE 5.0, the codice_12 &quot;Command Processor Shell&quot; includes the codice_2 command. 

 as found on Unix systems is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It appeared in Version 5 Unix. The version of codice_2 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Jim Meyering.

The numerical computing environments MATLAB and GNU Octave include a codice_2 
function with similar functionality. The OpenVMS equivalent is codice_16.

==*nix examples==
Note: POSIX requires that the default behavior be as if the codice_17 switch were provided.

==Working directory shell variables==
POSIX shells set the following environment variables while using the cd command:

; OLDPWD : The previous working directory (as set by the cd command).
; PWD : The current working directory (as set by the cd command).

<text>Quackery, often synonymous with health fraud, is the promotion of fraudulent or ignorant medical practices. A quack is a &quot;fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill&quot; or &quot;a person who pretends, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, qualification or credentials they do not possess; a charlatan or snake oil salesman&quot;. The term &quot;quack&quot; is a clipped form of the archaic term &quot;&quot;, derived from a &quot;hawker of salve&quot; or rather somebody who boasted about their salves, more commonly known as ointments. In the Middle Ages the term &quot;quack&quot; meant &quot;shouting&quot;. The quacksalvers sold their wares at markets by shouting to gain attention.

Common elements of general quackery include questionable diagnoses using questionable diagnostic tests, as well as untested or refuted treatments, especially for serious diseases such as cancer. Quackery is often described as &quot;health fraud&quot; with the salient characteristic of aggressive promotion.

== Definition ==

Psychiatrist and author Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch defines quackery as &quot;the promotion of unsubstantiated methods that lack a scientifically plausible rationale&quot; and more broadly as:
In addition to the ethical problems of promising benefits that are not likely to occur, quackery might cause people to forego treatments that are more likely to help them, in favor of ineffective treatments given by the &quot;quack&quot;.

American pediatrician Paul Offit has proposed four ways in which alternative medicine &quot;becomes quackery&quot;:

# &quot;by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful.&quot;
# &quot;by promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning.&quot;
# &quot;by draining patients&#x27; bank accounts ...&quot;
# &quot;by promoting magical thinking ...&quot;

Since it is difficult to distinguish between those who knowingly promote unproven medical therapies and those who are mistaken as to their effectiveness, United States courts have ruled in defamation cases that accusing someone of quackery or calling a practitioner a &quot;quack&quot; is not equivalent to accusing that person of committing medical fraud. However, the FDA makes little distinction between the two. To be considered a fraud, it is not strictly necessary for one to know they are misrepresenting the benefits or risks of the services offered.

== Quacksalver ==

Unproven, usually ineffective, and sometimes dangerous medicines and treatments have been peddled throughout human history. Theatrical performances were sometimes given to enhance the credibility of purported medicines. Grandiose claims were made for what could be humble materials indeed: for example, in the mid-19th century &quot;revalenta arabica&quot; was advertised as having extraordinary restorative virtues as an empirical diet for invalids; despite its impressive name and many glowing testimonials it was in truth only ordinary lentil flour, sold to the gullible at many times the true cost.

Even where no fraud was intended, quack remedies often contained no effective ingredients whatsoever. Some remedies contained substances such as opium, alcohol and honey, which would have given symptomatic relief but had no curative properties. Some would have addictive qualities to entice the buyer to return. The few effective remedies sold by quacks included emetics, laxatives and diuretics. Some ingredients did have medicinal effects: mercury, silver and arsenic compounds may have helped some infections and infestations; willow bark contains salicylic acid, chemically closely related to aspirin; and the quinine contained in Jesuit&#x27;s bark was an effective treatment for malaria and other fevers. However, knowledge of appropriate uses and dosages was limited.

== Criticism of quackery in academia ==
The evidence-based medicine community has criticized the infiltration of alternative medicine into mainstream academic medicine, education, and publications, accusing institutions of &quot;diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology.&quot;

For example, David Gorski criticized Brian M. Berman, founder of the University of Maryland Center for Integrative Medicine, for writing that &quot;There [is] evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture [are] more effective than no treatment and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.&quot; He also castigated editors and peer reviewers at the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; for allowing it to be published, since it effectively recommended deliberately misleading patients in order to achieve a known placebo effect.

== History in Europe and the United States ==

With little understanding of the causes and mechanisms of illnesses, widely marketed &quot;cures&quot; (as opposed to locally produced and locally used remedies), often referred to as patent medicines, first came to prominence during the 17th and 18th centuries in Britain and the British colonies, including those in North America. Daffy&#x27;s Elixir and Turlington&#x27;s Balsam were among the first products that used branding (e.g. using highly distinctive containers) and mass marketing to create and maintain markets. A similar process occurred in other countries of Europe around the same time, for example with the marketing of Eau de Cologne as a cure-all medicine by Johann Maria Farina and his imitators. Patent medicines often contained alcohol or opium, which, while presumably not curing the diseases for which they were sold as a remedy, did make the imbibers feel better and confusedly appreciative of the product.

The number of internationally marketed quack medicines increased in the later 18th century; the majority of them originated in Britain and were exported throughout the British Empire. By 1830, British parliamentary records list over 1,300 different &quot;proprietary medicines&quot;, the majority of which were &quot;quack&quot; cures by modern standards.

A Dutch organisation that opposes quackery, &#x27; (VtdK), was founded in 1881, making it the oldest organisation of this kind in the world. It has published its magazine &#x27; (&quot;Dutch Magazine against Quackery&quot;) ever since. In these early years the played a part in the professionalisation of medicine. Its efforts in the public debate helped to make the Netherlands one of the first countries with governmental drug regulation.
In 1909, in an attempt to stop the sale of quack medicines, the British Medical Association published &quot;Secret Remedies, What They Cost And What They Contain&quot;. This publication was originally a series of articles published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; between 1904 and 1909. The publication was composed of 20 chapters, organising the work by sections according to the ailments the medicines claimed to treat. Each remedy was tested thoroughly, the preface stated: &quot;Of the accuracy of the analytical data there can be no question; the investigation has been carried out with great care by a skilled analytical chemist.&quot; The book did lead to the end of some of the quack cures, but some survived the book by several decades. For example, Beecham&#x27;s Pills, which according to the British Medical Association contained in 1909 only aloes, ginger and soap, but claimed to cure 31 medical conditions, were sold until 1998. The failure of the medical establishment to stop quackery was rooted in the difficulty of defining what precisely distinguished real medicine, and in the appeals that quackery held out to consumers.

British patent medicines lost their dominance in the United States when they were denied access to the Thirteen Colonies markets during the American Revolution, and lost further ground for the same reason during the War of 1812. From the early 19th century &quot;home-grown&quot; American brands started to fill the gap, reaching their peak in the years after the American Civil War. British medicines never regained their previous dominance in North America, and the subsequent era of mass marketing of American patent medicines is usually considered to have been a &quot;golden age&quot; of quackery in the United States. This was mirrored by similar growth in marketing of quack medicines elsewhere in the world.
In the United States, false medicines in this era were often denoted by the slang term snake oil, a reference to sales pitches for the false medicines that claimed exotic ingredients provided the supposed benefits. Those who sold them were called &quot;snake oil salesmen&quot;, and usually sold their medicines with a fervent pitch similar to a fire and brimstone religious sermon. They often accompanied other theatrical and entertainment productions that traveled as a road show from town to town, leaving quickly before the falseness of their medicine was discovered. Not all quacks were restricted to such small-time businesses however, and a number, especially in the United States, became enormously wealthy through national and international sales of their products.

In 1875, the &quot;Pacific Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; complained: 

One among many examples is William Radam, a German immigrant to the US, who, in the 1880s, started to sell his &quot;Microbe Killer&quot; throughout the United States and, soon afterwards, in Britain and throughout the British colonies. His concoction was widely advertised as being able to &quot;cure all diseases&quot;, and this phrase was even embossed on the glass bottles the medicine was sold in. In fact, Radam&#x27;s medicine was a therapeutically useless (and in large quantities actively poisonous) dilute solution of sulfuric acid, coloured with a little red wine. Radam&#x27;s publicity material, particularly his books, provide an insight into the role that pseudoscience played in the development and marketing of &quot;quack&quot; medicines towards the end of the 19th century.

Advertising claims similar to those of Radam can be found throughout the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. &quot;Dr.&quot; Sibley, an English patent medicine seller of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, even went so far as to claim that his Reanimating Solar Tincture would, as the name implies, &quot;restore life in the event of sudden death&quot;. Another English quack, &quot;Dr. Solomon&quot; claimed that his Cordial Balm of Gilead cured almost anything, but was particularly effective against all venereal complaints, from gonorrhea to onanism. Although it was basically just brandy flavoured with herbs, the price of a bottle was a half guinea (£sd system) in 1800, equivalent to over £ ($) in 2014.

Not all patent medicines were without merit. Turlingtons Balsam of Life, first marketed in the mid-18th century, did have genuinely beneficial properties. This medicine continued to be sold under the original name into the early 20th century, and can still be found in the British and American pharmacopoeias as &quot;Compound tincture of benzoin&quot;. In these cases, the treatments likely lacked empirical support when they were introduced to the market, and their benefits were simply a convenient coincidence discovered after the fact.

The end of the road for the quack medicines now considered grossly fraudulent in the nations of North America and Europe came in the early 20th century. 21 February 1906 saw the passage into law of the Pure Food and Drug Act in the United States. This was the result of decades of campaigning by both government departments and the medical establishment, supported by a number of publishers and journalists (one of the most effective was Samuel Hopkins Adams, who wrote &quot;The Great American Fraud&quot; series in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in 1905). This American Act was followed three years later by similar legislation in Britain and in other European nations. Between them, these laws began to remove the more outrageously dangerous contents from patent and proprietary medicines, and to force quack medicine proprietors to stop making some of their more blatantly dishonest claims. The Act, however, left advertising and claims of effectiveness unregulated as the Supreme Court interpreted it to mean only that ingredients on labels had to be accurate. Language in the 1912 Sherley Amendment, meant to close this loophole, was limited to regulating claims that were false and fraudulent, creating the need to show intent. Throughout the early 20th century, the American Medical Association collected material on medical quackery, and one of their members and medical editors in particular, Arthur J. Cramp, devoted his career to criticizing such products. The AMA&#x27;s Department of Investigation closed in 1975, but their only archive open to non-members remains, the American Medical Association Health Fraud and Alternative Medicine Collection.

&quot;Medical quackery and promotion of nostrums and worthless drugs were among the most prominent abuses that led to formal self-regulation in business and, in turn, to the creation of the Better Business Bureau.&quot;

== Contemporary culture ==
&quot;Quackery is the promotion of false and unproven health schemes for a profit. It is rooted in the traditions of the marketplace&quot;, with &quot;commercialism overwhelming professionalism in the marketing of alternative medicine&quot;. &quot;Quackery&quot; is most often used to denote the peddling of the &quot;cure-alls&quot; described above. Quackery is an ongoing problem that can be found in any culture and in every medical tradition. Unlike other advertising mediums, rapid advancements in communication through the Internet have opened doors for an unregulated market of quack cures and marketing campaigns rivaling the early 20th century. Most people with an e-mail account have experienced the marketing tactics of spamming – in which modern forms of quackery are touted as miraculous remedies for &quot;weight loss&quot; and &quot;sexual enhancement&quot;, as well as outlets for medicines of unknown quality.

===India===
In 2008, the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; reported that some officials and doctors estimated that there were more than 40,000 quacks practicing in Delhi, following outrage over a &quot;multi-state racket where unqualified doctors conducted hundreds of illegal kidney transplants for huge profits.&quot; The president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in 2008 criticized the central government for failing to address the problem of quackery and for not framing any laws against it.

In 2017, IMA again asked for an antiquackery law with stringent action against those practicing without a license. As of 2024, the government of India is yet to pass an anti-quackery law.

====Ministry of Ayush====
In 2014, the Government of India formed a Ministry of AYUSH that includes the seven traditional systems of healthcare.
The Ministry of Ayush (expanded from Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy), is purposed with developing education, research and propagation of indigenous alternative medicine systems in India. The ministry has faced significant criticism for funding systems that lack biological plausibility and are either untested or conclusively proven as ineffective. Quality of research has been poor, and drugs have been launched without any rigorous pharmacological studies and meaningful clinical trials on Ayurveda or other alternative healthcare systems.

There is no credible efficacy or scientific basis of any of these forms of treatment. A strong consensus prevails among the scientific community that homeopathy is a pseudo-scientific, unethical and implausible line of treatment. Ayurveda is deemed to be pseudoscientific. Much of the research on postural yoga has taken the form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality; there is no conclusive therapeutic effect except in back pain. Naturopathy is considered to be a form of pseudo-scientific quackery, ineffective and possibly harmful, with a plethora of ethical concerns about the very practice.

Unani lacks biological plausibility and is considered to be pseudo-scientific quackery, as well.

===United States===

While quackery is often aimed at the aged or chronically ill, it can be aimed at all age groups, including teens, and the FDA has mentioned some areas where potential quackery may be a problem: breast developers, weight loss, steroids and growth hormones, tanning and tanning pills, hair removal and growth, and look-alike drugs.

In 1992, the president of The National Council Against Health Fraud, William T. Jarvis, wrote in &quot;Clinical Chemistry&quot; that:


For those in the practice of any medicine, to allege quackery is to level a serious objection to a particular form of practice. Most developed countries have a governmental agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, whose purpose is to monitor and regulate the safety of medications as well as the claims made by the manufacturers of new and existing products, including drugs and nutritional supplements or vitamins. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) participates in some of these efforts. To better address less regulated products, in 2000, US President Clinton signed Executive Order 13147 that created the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine. In 2002, the commission&#x27;s final report made several suggestions regarding education, research, implementation, and reimbursement as ways to evaluate the risks and benefits of each. As a direct result, more public dollars have been allocated for research into some of these methods.
Individuals and non-governmental agencies are active in attempts to expose quackery. According to John C. Norcross et al. less is consensus about ineffective &quot;compared to effective procedures&quot; but identifying both &quot;pseudoscientific, unvalidated, or &#x27;quack&#x27; psychotherapies&quot; and &quot;assessment measures of questionable validity on psycho-metric grounds&quot; was pursued by various authors. The evidence-based practice (EBP) movement in mental health emphasizes the consensus in psychology that psychological practice should rely on empirical research. There are also &quot;anti-quackery&quot; websites, such as Quackwatch, that help consumers evaluate claims. Quackwatch&#x27;s information is relevant to both consumers and medical professionals.

== Presence and acceptance ==


There have been several suggested reasons why quackery is accepted by patients in spite of its lack of effectiveness:
;Ignorance: Those who perpetuate quackery may do so to take advantage of ignorance about conventional medical treatments versus alternative treatments, or may themselves be ignorant regarding their own claims. Mainstream medicine has produced many remarkable advances, so people may tend to also believe groundless claims.
;Placebo effect: Medicines or treatments known to have no pharmacological effect on a disease can still affect a person&#x27;s perception of their illness, and this belief in its turn does indeed sometimes have a therapeutic effect, causing the patient&#x27;s condition to improve. This is &quot;not&quot; to say that no real cure of biological illness is effected – &quot;though we might describe a placebo effect as being &#x27;all in the mind&#x27;, we now know that there is a genuine neurobiological basis to this phenomenon.&quot; People report reduced pain, increased well-being, improvement, or even total alleviation of symptoms. For some, the presence of a caring practitioner and the dispensation of medicine is curative in itself.
;Regression fallacy: Lack of understanding that health conditions change with no treatment and attributing changes in ailments to a given therapy.
;Confirmation bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, or prioritize information in a way that confirms one&#x27;s beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.
;Distrust of conventional medicine: Many people, for various reasons, have a distrust of conventional medicine, or of the regulating organizations such as the FDA, or the major drug corporations. For example, &quot;CAM may represent a response to disenfranchisement [discrimination] in conventional medical settings and resulting distrust&quot;.
;Conspiracy theories: Anti-quackery activists (&quot;quackbusters&quot;) are often falsely accused of being part of a huge &quot;conspiracy&quot; to suppress &quot;unconventional&quot; and/or &quot;natural&quot; therapies, as well as those who promote them. It is alleged that this conspiracy is backed and funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the established medical care system – represented by the AMA, FDA, ADA, CDC, WHO, etc. – for the purpose of preserving their power and increasing their profits. This idea is often held by people with antiscience views.
;Fear of side effects: A great variety of pharmaceutical medications can have very distressing side effects, and many people fear surgery and its consequences, so they may opt to shy away from these mainstream treatments.
;Cost: There are some people who simply cannot afford conventional treatment, and seek out a cheaper alternative. Nonconventional practitioners can often dispense treatment at a much lower cost. This is compounded by reduced access to healthcare.
;Desperation: People with a serious or terminal disease, or who have been told by their practitioner that their condition is &quot;untreatable&quot;, may react by seeking out treatment, disregarding the lack of scientific proof for its effectiveness, or even the existence of evidence that the method is ineffective or even dangerous. Despair may be exacerbated by the lack of palliative non-curative end-of-life care. Between 2012 and 2018 appeals on UK crowdfunding sites for cancer treatment with an alternative health element have raised £8 million. This is described as &quot;a new and lucrative revenue stream for cranks, charlatans, and conmen who prey on the vulnerable.&quot;
;Pride: Once people have endorsed or defended a cure, or invested time and money in it, they may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit its ineffectiveness and therefore recommend a treatment that does not work. This is a manifestation of the sunk cost fallacy.
;Fraud: Some practitioners, fully aware of the ineffectiveness of their medicine, may intentionally produce fraudulent scientific studies, for example, thereby confusing any potential consumers as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment.

== Deceased persons accused of quackery ==

* Thomas Allinson (1858–1918), founder of naturopathy. His views often brought him into conflict with the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the General Medical Council, particularly his opposition to doctors&#x27; frequent use of drugs, his opposition to vaccination and his self-promotion in the press. His views and publication of them led to him being labeled a quack and being struck off by the General Medical Council for &quot;infamous conduct in a professional respect&quot;.
* Lovisa Åhrberg (1801–1881), the first Swedish female doctor. Åhrberg was met with strong resistance from male doctors and was accused of quackery. During the formal examination, she was acquitted of all charges and allowed to practice medicine in Stockholm even though it was forbidden for women in the 1820s. She later received a medal for her work.
* Johanna Brandt (1876–1964), a South African naturopath who advocated the &quot;Grape Cure&quot; as a cure for cancer.
* John R. Brinkley (1885–1942), a nonphysician and xenotransplant specialist in Kansas, US, who claimed to have discovered a method of effectively transplanting the testicles of goats into aging men. After state authorities took steps to shut down his practice, he retaliated by entering politics in 1930 and unsuccessfully running for the office of Governor of Kansas.
* Hulda Regehr Clark (1928–2009), was a controversial naturopath, author, and practitioner of alternative medicine who claimed to be able to cure all diseases and advocated methods that have no scientific validity.
* Max Gerson (1881–1959), was a German-born American physician who developed a dietary-based alternative cancer treatment that he claimed could cure cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases. His treatment was called The Gerson Therapy. Most notably, Gerson Therapy was used, unsuccessfully, to treat Jessica Ainscough and Garry Winogrand. According to Quackwatch, Gerson Institute claims of cure are based not on actual documentation of survival, but on &quot;a combination of the doctor&#x27;s estimate that the departing patient has a &#x27;reasonable chance of surviving&#x27;, plus feelings that the Institute staff have about the status of people who call in&quot;. The American Cancer Society reports that &quot;[t]here is no reliable scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is effective ...&quot;

* Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), founder of homeopathy. Hahnemann believed that all diseases were caused by &quot;miasms&quot;, which he defined as irregularities in the patient&#x27;s vital force. He also said that illnesses could be treated by substances that in a healthy person produced similar symptoms to the illness, in extremely low concentrations, with the therapeutic effect increasing with dilution and repeated shaking.
* Lawrence B. Hamlin (in 1916), was fined under the 1906 US Pure Food and Drug Act for advertising that his Wizard Oil could kill cancer.
* L. Ron Hubbard (1911–1986), was the founder of the Church of Scientology. He was an American science fiction writer, former US Navy officer, and creator of Dianetics. He has been commonly called a quack and a con man by both critics of Scientology and by many psychiatric organizations in part for his often extreme anti-psychiatric beliefs and false claims about technologies such as the E-meter.
* Linda Hazzard (1867–1938), was a self-declared doctor and fasting specialist, which she advertised as a panacea for every medical ailment. Up to 40 patients may have died of starvation in her &quot;sanitarium&quot; in Olalla, Washington, US. Imprisoned for one death in 1912, Hazzard was paroled in 1915 and continued to practice medicine without a license in New Zealand (1915–1920) and Washington, US (1920–1935). Died in 1938 while attempting a fasting to cure herself.
* William Donald Kelley (1925–2005), was an orthodontist and a follower of Max Gerson who developed his own alternative cancer treatment called Nonspecific Metabolic Therapy. This treatment is based on the unsubstantiated belief that &quot;wrong foods [cause] malignancy to grow, while proper foods [allow] natural body defenses to work&quot;. It involves, specifically, treatment with pancreatic enzymes, 50 daily vitamins and minerals (including laetrile), frequent body shampoos, coffee enemas, and a specific diet. According to Quackwatch, &quot;not only is his therapy ineffective, but people with cancer who take it die more quickly and have a worse quality of life than those having standard treatment, and can develop serious or fatal side-effects. Kelley&#x27;s most famous patient was actor Steve McQueen.
* John Harvey Kellogg (1852–1943), was a medical doctor in Battle Creek, Michigan, US, who ran a sanitarium using holistic methods, with a particular focus on nutrition, enemas and exercise. Kellogg was an advocate of vegetarianism and invented the corn flake breakfast cereal with his brother, Will Keith Kellogg.
* John St. John Long (1798–1834) was an Irish artist who claimed to be able to cure tuberculosis by causing a sore or wound on the back of the patient, out of which the disease would exit. He was tried twice for manslaughter of his patients who died under this treatment.
* Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), was a German physician and astrologist, who invented what he called &quot;magnétisme animal&quot;.
* Theodor Morell (1886–1948), a German physician best known as Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor. Morell administered approximately 74 substances, in 28 different mixtures to Hitler, including heroin, cocaine, Doktor Koster&#x27;s Antigaspills, potassium bromide, papaverine, testosterone, vitamins and animal enzymes. Despite Hitler&#x27;s dependence on Morell, and his recommendations of him to other Nazi leaders, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer and others quietly dismissed Morell as a quack.
* Daniel David Palmer (1845–1913), was a grocery store owner that claimed to have healed a janitor of deafness after adjusting the alignment of his back. He founded the field of chiropractic based on the principle that all disease and ailments could be fixed by adjusting the alignment of someone&#x27;s back. His hypothesis was disregarded by medical professionals at the time and despite a considerable following has yet to be scientifically proven. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself &#x27;doctor&#x27;. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: &quot;A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method … he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims … His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack.&quot;
* Louis Pasteur (1822–1895), was a French chemist best known for his remarkable breakthroughs in microbiology. His experiments confirmed the germ theory of disease, also reducing mortality from puerperal fever (childbed), and he created the first vaccine for rabies. He is best known to the general public for showing how to stop milk and wine from going sourthis process came to be called &quot;pasteurization&quot;. His hypotheses initially met with much hostility, and he was accused of quackery on multiple occasions. However, he is now regarded as one of the three main founders of microbiology, together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch.
* Linus Pauling (1901–1994), a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, Pauling spent much of his later career arguing for the treatment of somatic and psychological diseases with orthomolecular medicine. Among his claims were that the common cold could be cured with massive doses of vitamin C. Together with Ewan Cameron he wrote the 1979 book &quot;Cancer and Vitamin C&quot;, which was again more popular with the public than the medical profession, which continued to regard claims about the effectiveness of vitamin C in treating or preventing cancer as quackery. A biographer has discussed how controversial his views on megadoses of Vitamin C have been and that he was &quot;still being called a &#x27;fraud&#x27; and a &#x27;quack&#x27; by opponents of his &#x27;orthomolecular medicine.
* Doctor John Henry Pinkard (1866–1934) was a Roanoke, Virginia businessman and &quot;Yarb Doctor&quot; or &quot;Herb Doctor&quot; who concocted quack medicines that he sold and distributed in violation of the Food and Drugs Act and the earlier Pure Food and Drug Act. He was also known as a &quot;clairvoyant, herb doctor and spiritualist.&quot; Some of Pinkard&#x27;s Sanguinaria Compound, made from bloodroot or bloodwort, was seized by federal officials in 1931. &quot;Analysis by this department of a sample of the article showed that it consisted essentially of extracts of plant drugs including sanguinaria, sugar, alcohol, and water. It was alleged in the information that the article was misbranded in that certain statements, designs, and devices regarding the therapeutic and curative effects of the article, appearing on the bottle label, falsely and fraudulently represented that it would be effective as a treatment, remedy, and cure for pneumonia, coughs, weak lungs, asthma, kidney, liver, bladder, or any stomach troubles, and effective as a great blood and nerve tonic.&quot; He pleaded guilty and was fined.
* Wilhelm Reich (1897–1957), Austrian-American Psychoanalyst. Claimed that he had discovered a primordial cosmic energy called Orgone. He developed several devices, including the Cloudbuster and the Orgone Accumulator, that he believed could use orgone to manipulate the weather, battle space aliens and cure diseases, including cancer. After an investigation, the US Food and Drug Administration concluded that they were dealing with a &quot;fraud of the first magnitude&quot;. On 10 February 1954, the US Attorney for Maine filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction under Sections 301 and 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, to prevent interstate shipment of orgone accumulators and to ban some of Reich&#x27;s writing promoting and advertising the devices. Reich refused to appear in court, arguing that no court was in a position to evaluate his work. Reich was arrested for contempt of court, and convicted to two years in jail, a US$10,000 fine, and his Orgone Accumulators and work on Orgone were ordered to be destroyed. On 23 August 1956, six tons of his books, journals, and papers were burned in the 25th Street public incinerator in New York. On 12 March 1957, he was sent to Danbury Federal Prison, where Richard C. Hubbard, a psychiatrist who admired Reich, examined him, recording paranoia manifested by delusions of grandiosity, persecution, and ideas of reference. Nine months later, on 18 November 1957, Reich died of a heart attack while he was in the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
* William Herbert Sheldon (1898–1977), who created the theory of somatotypes corresponding to intelligence.

==Information Age quackery==
As technology has evolved, particularly with the advent and wide adoption of the internet, it has increasingly become a source of quackery. For example, writing in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Virginia Heffernan criticized WebMD for biasing readers toward drugs that are sold by the site&#x27;s pharmaceutical sponsors, even when they are unnecessary. She wrote that WebMD &quot;has become permeated with pseudomedicine and subtle misinformation.&quot;

<text>Schaumburg-Lippe, also called Lippe-Schaumburg, was created as a county in 1647, became a principality in 1807 and a free state in 1918, and was until 1946 a small state in Germany, located in the present-day state of Lower Saxony, with its capital at Bückeburg, an area of and over 40,000 inhabitants.

== History ==

Schaumburg-Lippe was formed as a county in 1647 through the division of the County of Schaumburg by treaties between the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and the Count of Lippe. The division occurred because Count Otto V of Holstein-Schaumburg had died in 1640 leaving no male heir. Initially Schaumburg-Lippe&#x27;s position was somewhat precarious: it had to share a wide variety of institutions and facilities with the County of Schaumburg (which belonged to Hesse-Kassel), including the representative assembly and the highly productive Bückeberg mines, and the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel retained some feudal rights over it. It was further threatened by the headstrong policies of the ruling Count, Frederick Christian. To counter these threats, Frederick&#x27;s grandson, Count William (who reigned 1748–1777) retained a standing army of up to 1000 troops – quite a lot for such a small territory.

With William&#x27;s death in 1777, the junior line Schaumburg-Lippe-Alverdissen inherited the county, thereby reuniting Schaumburg-Lippe with Lippe-Alverdissen.

Schaumburg-Lippe was a county until 1807, when it became a principality; from 1871 it was a state within the German Empire. In 1913, it was the least populous state in the German Empire. The capital was Bückeburg, while Stadthagen was the only other town. Under the constitution of 1868, there was a legislative diet of 15 members with ten elected by the towns and rural districts, one each by the nobility, clergy and educated classes and the remaining two nominated by the prince. Schaumburg-Lippe sent one member to the Bundesrat (federal council) and one deputy to the Reichstag. The principality lasted until the end of the German monarchies in 1918, when it became a free state as the Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe. In November 1918, Prince Adolf was the penultimate German monarch to abdicate.

<doc id="212710" wikidata="Q165763" url="?curid=212710" title="Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont">
<text>The County of Waldeck (later the Principality of Waldeck and Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont) was a state of the Holy Roman Empire and its successors from the late 12th century until 1929. In 1349 the county gained Imperial immediacy and in 1712 was raised to the rank of principality. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 it was a constituent state of its successors: the Confederation of the Rhine, the German Confederation, the North German Confederation, and the German Empire. After the abolition of the monarchy in 1918, the renamed Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont became a component of the Weimar Republic until divided between Hannover and other Prussian provinces in 1929. It comprised territories in present-day Hesse and Lower Saxony (Germany).

==History==
The noble family of the and the later Princes of Waldeck and Pyrmont were male line descendants of the (based at Schwalenberg Castle), ultimately descendent from (reigned 1127–1136/7). Waldeck Castle, overlooking the Eder river at Waldeck, was first attested in 1120. A branch of the family was named after the castle in 1180, when acquired the castle through his marriage with Luitgard, daughter of Count of and , who was heiress of Waldeck. Over time, the family built up a small lordship in modern day North Hesse.

=== County of Waldeck ===
Initially, Waldeck was a fief of the Electorate of Mainz. In 1379, it became the County of Reichslehen. After the death of Count Henry VI in 1397, the family split into two lines: the senior Landau line founded by Adolph III and the junior Waldeck line founded by Henry VII, which sometimes feuded with one another. The two lines came under the sovereignty of the Landgraviate of Hesse in 1431 and 1438 respectively, due to financial difficulties and the final victory of the Landgraviate over Mainz in 1427, which led to the transfer of the to Hesse. The Landgraves levied tribute on the Counts of Waldeck in exchange for forgiving their debts to them and taking on all their debts to others.

After the death of Henry VIII in 1486, the Waldeck line split once more, into the Waldeck-Wildungen and Waldeck-Eisenberg lines. The senior Landau line ended with the death of Otto IV in 1495 and its possessions passed to the Wildungen and Eisenberg lines. In 1526 and 1529, Philip IV of Waldeck-Wildungen and Philip III of Waldeck-Eisenberg converted their respective principalities to Lutheranism. Several partitions led to the creation of further lines, but these were reunited by the new Wildung line in 1692.

In 1626, the family also inherited the and thereafter called themselves &quot;Counts of Waldeck and Pyrmont.&quot; The two counties of Waldeck and Pyrmont were physically separated and were not united into a single legal entity until the 19th century.

In 1639, Count Philip Dietrich of Waldeck from the new Eisenberg line, inherited the in Gelderland along with the counties of in Münsterland, , and Wittem. The Lordship of Tonna in Thüringen, a fief of the Dukes of Saxe-Altenburg was inherited by Waldeck-Pyrmont in 1640, but sold to Duke Frederick I of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1677. Waldeck remained the main residence of the county until 1655, when the residence was shifted from Waldeck to Arolsen. Philip Dietrich was succeeded in 1664 by his brother Count George Frederick, whose full title was &quot;Count and Lord of Waldeck, Pyrmont, and Cuylenburg, Lord of Tonna, Paland, Wittem, Werth.&quot; In 1682, he was promoted by Emperor Leopold I to the status of &quot;Prince of Waldeck&quot;, with Imperial immediacy. His four sons all predeceased him, so on 12 June 1685, he made a contract with his cousin, Christian Louis of the new Wildung line, to transfer the whole Waldeck patrimony to him and for it to be inherited by primogeniture thereafter. This agreement was confirmed by Emperor Leopold in 1697. After George Frederick&#x27;s death in 1692, Christian Louis became the sole ruler of the entire principality.

The County of Cuylenburg and the Lordship of Werth were lost in 1714, owing to the marriage of George Frederick&#x27;s second daughter, Sophia Henriette (1662-1702) to Ernest of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

=== Principality of Waldeck (1712–1848) ===
On 6 January 1712, Frederick Anthony Ulrich of Waldeck and Pyrmont was elevated to prince by Emperor Charles VI. During the American War of Independence from 1775 to 1783, Prince Frederick Carl Augustus provided a single battalion sized regiment to the British for the war in America in exchange for payment. A total of 1,225 Waldeck soldiers fought in America. 

The principality was caught up in the Napoleonic Wars and in 1807 it joined the Confederation of the Rhine, but not the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia. Waldeck was required to guarantee equal rights of worship to its Catholic citizens and supply 400 soldiers in case of a campaign. For a brief period, from 1806 until 1812, Pyrmont was a separate principality as a result of the partition of the territory between the brothers Frederick and George, but the territories were reunited after Frederick&#x27;s death.

The independence of the principality was confirmed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, and Waldeck and Pyrmont became a member of the German Confederation. In 1832 it joined the Zollverein. In 1847, on Prussian initiative, the sovereignty of Hesse-Kassel over Waldeck (and Schaumburg-Lippe) was finally revoked by the Federal Convention of the Confederation. This had been the case &quot;de facto&quot; since Waldeck joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807, but the ruling meant that Hesse-Kassel lost the right to claim the territory in escheat. 

=== Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1849–1918) ===
Since 1645, Waldeck had been in a personal union with the . Beginning in 1813, the prince strove to unite the two territories legally into the Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont. However, political opposition meant that this did not take place until 1849. Even after the unification, Pyrmont retained its own tiny Landtag for budgetary matters until 1863/64. In 1849–1850, Waldeck was divided into three districts: the , the and the . 
On 1 August 1862, Waldeck-Pyrmont concluded a military convention with Prussia. As a result, Waldeck-Pyrmont fought on the Prussian side in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and thus avoided annexation at the war&#x27;s end – unlike the neighbouring Electorate of Hesse. However, the small, cash-strapped principality could not afford to pay its contributions to the new North German Confederation, so the principality&#x27;s Landtag unanimously voted to reject the North German Constitution in order to pressure the prince into signing an accession treaty Prussia. Bismarck had previously ruled out unification with Prussia on grounds of prestige. Therefore, under the treaty that Waldeck-Pyrmont and Prussia signed in October 1867, the principality remained nominally independent and retained its legislative sovereignty, but from 1 January 1868 Prussian took control of the principality&#x27;s state deficit, internal administration, judiciary, and schools. Thereafter, Prussia appointed a State Director formally with the agreement of the prince. Appellate jurisdiction for Waldeck was exercised by the Prussian state court (&quot;Landgericht&quot;) in Kassel and for Pyrmont by the state court in Hannover. The prince retained control over the administration of the church, the prerogative of mercy, and the right of veto over new laws. He also continued to receive the income from his domains. Prussian administration served to reduce administrative costs for the small state and was based on a ten-year contract that was repeatedly renewed for the duration of its existence. The situation continued in 1871, when the principality became a constituent state of the new German Empire. In 1905, Waldeck and Pyrmont had an area of 1121 km2 and a population of 59,000.

The princely house of Waldeck and Pyrmont is closely related to the royal family of the Netherlands. The last ruling prince, Frederick, was the brother of Queen Consort Emma of the Netherlands.

=== Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1919–1929) ===

On 13 November 1918, at the end of World War I, during the German Revolution that resulted in the fall of all the German monarchies, a representative of the revolutionary workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council of Kassel came to Waldeck and declared that the monarchy was abolished. The principality became the Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont within the Weimar Republic. However, no new constitution was produced, so the monarchical constitution of 1849/1852 remained in force &quot;de jure&quot; until 1929. The terms of the treaty with Prussia also remained in force. Following a referendum, Pyrmont was separated from Waldeck on 30 November 1921 and joined Prussia, becoming part of the new Hameln-Pyrmont district of the Province of Hanover. After this, the territory was simply the Free State of Waldeck.

The remaining territory continued to be governed according to the 1867 treaty with Prussia until it was cancelled in 1926. On 9 April 1927, the federal Financial Equalisation act (&quot;Finanzausgleichsgesetz&quot;) was amended. For Waldeck, this meant that its allocation of federal tax income was reduced by almost 600,000 Reichsmarks. Without a massive rise in local taxes, the Free State was no longer financially viable. Therefore on 1 April 1929, the state was abolished and became part of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. This marked the end of Waldeck&#x27;s existence as a sovereign state.

===Developments since 1929===
When Waldeck joined Prussia in 1929, the three districts into which Waldeck had been divided in 1849–1850 (Eder, Eisenberg, and Twiste) were initially retained. Additionally, Höringhausen and Eimelrod, which had been exclaves of Prussia surrounded by Waldeck since 1866, were joined to Eisenberg district. In 1932, the federal government merged Eder and Eisenberg districts. The district of the Twiste was to be merged with the neighbouring district of Wolfhagen on 1 April 1934, but this was delayed after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. A law of 28 February 1934 reversed the merger of Eder and Eisenberg and definitively cancelled the planned merger of Twiste and Wolfhagen.

On 1 February 1942, the three districts of Waldeck were merged into the new , which had its capital at Korbach. This new district had roughly the same borders as the old Free State. It was made part of Greater Hesse in 1945, which became the state of Hesse in the modern Federal Republic of Germany in 1946. On 1 August 1972, the city of Volkmarsen was separated from the district of Wolfhagen and reassigned to Waldeck. During the reform of the districts of Hesse in 1974, Waldeck was merged with the neighbouring district of Frankeberg to from the new district of Waldeck-Frankenberg, while the city of Züschen became a suburb of Fritzlar in Schwalm-Eder-Kreis.

==Military==
Waldeck had raised a battalion of infantry in 1681 but for much of the subsequent history leading up to the Napoleonic Wars, Waldeckers generally served as what is commonly described as &#x27;mercenaries&#x27;, but was actually &#x27;auxiliaries&#x27; hired out by the rulers of Waldeck for foreign service. Such was the demand that the single battalion became two in 1740 (the 1st Regiment), three battalions in 1744, four in 1767 (forming a 2nd Regiment). Most notably the foreign service was with the Dutch (the 1st and 2nd Regiments) and British (after an agreement was signed with Great Britain in 1776 to supply troops for the American War of Independence, the 3rd Waldeck Regiment, of a single battalion, was raised). The 3rd Waldeck Regiment thus served in America, where they were known under the &#x27;umbrella term&#x27; used during that conflict for all Germans—&#x27;Hessians&#x27;. The regiment, which was made up of 4 &#x27;Battalion companies&#x27;, a &#x27;Grenadier&#x27; company, staff and a detachment of artillery, was captured by French and Spanish troops supporting the Americans and only a small number returned to Germany, where some formed part of a newly raised 5th Battalion (1784).

By the time of Napoleon&#x27;s conquest of Germany, the Waldeck regiments in Dutch service had been dissolved when, as the Batavian Republic, the country was made into a kingdom ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s brother Louis. Reduced to battalion strength, they now formed the 3rd battalions of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments of the Kingdom of Holland. The 5th Battalion was disbanded, and Waldeck was now also obliged to provide two companies to the II Battalion, 6th German Confederation (i.e., Confederation of the Rhine) Regiment (along with two companies from Reuß) in the service of the French Empire. As with all French infantry, they were referred to as &#x27;Fusiliers&#x27;. They served mainly in the Peninsular War against the Duke of Wellington. In 1812, the 6th Confederation Regiment was re-formed, with three companies from Waldeck and one from Reuß again forming the II Battalion. By the time of the downfall of the French Empire in 1814 the battalions in Dutch service had disappeared, but Waldeck now supplied three Infantry and one Jäger Companies to the newly formed German Confederation.
By 1866, the Waldeck contingent was styled &quot;Fürstlisches Waldecksches Füselier-Bataillon&quot;, and in the Austro-Prussian War of that year Waldeck (already in a military convention with Prussia from 1862) allied with the Prussians; however the battalion saw no action. Joining the North German Confederation after 1867, under Prussian leadership, the Waldeck Fusilier Battalion became the III (Fusilier) Battalion of the Prussian Infantry Regiment von Wittich (3rd Electoral Hessian) No. 83, and as such it remained until 1918. The position of regimental &#x27;Chef&#x27; (an honorary title) was held by the Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont.

Unlike Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) retained no distinctions to differentiate them from the Prussian. The Waldeckers however, were permitted the distinction of carrying the Cockade of Waldeck on the Pickelhaube. The Waldeck battalion was garrisoned, at various times, at Arolsen/Mengeringhausen/Helsen, Bad Wildungen, Bad Pyrmont and Warburg.

The regiment saw action in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 (where it acquired the nickname &quot;Das Eiserne Regiment&quot;), and during the First World War—as part of the 22nd Division—fought mainly on the Eastern Front.

<text>Yad Mordechai (, &quot;lit.&quot; Memorial of Mordechai) is a kibbutz in Southern Israel. Located 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Ashkelon, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof Ashkelon Regional Council. In it had a population of .

==History==
The community was founded in 1936 by Hashomer Hatzair members from Poland and initially organized themselves in a kibbutz called Mitzpe Yam close to Netanya, which was also founded in 1936. However, the 14 dunams allocated to the kibbutz were insufficient to develop the kibbutz. As part of settlement in the Negev, the community moved to its site near Ashkelon in December 1943. The kibbutz was renamed in memorial to Mordechai Anielewicz, who was the first commander of the Jewish Fighting Organization in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the kibbutz was attacked by Egypt in the Battle of Yad Mordechai.

Among the many Holocaust memorials in Israel, the &quot;From Holocaust to Revival Museum&quot; especially commemorates Jewish resistance against the Nazis as well as the 1948 Battle of Yad Mordechai. The statue of Anielewicz by Nathan Rapoport clutching a grenade, next to the water tower which was destroyed by the Egyptians in May 1948, is a noted symbol of the kibbutz.

After 1948, Yad Mordechai expanded on the land of the Palestinian village of Hiribya, which Israel depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

During the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, in which more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed, Hamas gunmen attempted to infiltrate the kibbutz. The kibbutz security team repulsed the attack, emerging from the gate to engage the attackers and chasing them from the area. The kibbutz was also the target of several rocket attacks.

==Economy==
The Yad Mordechai honey, jam and olive oil brands have been partnered with the Strauss Group, an Israeli food products manufacturer.

<doc id="212724" wikidata="Q397469" url="?curid=212724" title="Neo-romanticism">
<text>The term neo-romanticism is used to cover a variety of movements in philosophy, literature, music, painting, and architecture, as well as social movements, that exist after and incorporate elements from the era of Romanticism.

It has been used with reference to late-19th-century composers such as Richard Wagner particularly by Carl Dahlhaus who describes his music as &quot;a late flowering of romanticism in a positivist age&quot;. He regards it as synonymous with &quot;the age of Wagner&quot;, from about 1850 until 1890—the start of the era of modernism, whose leading early representatives were Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler . It has been applied to writers, painters, and composers who rejected, abandoned, or opposed realism, naturalism, or avant-garde modernism at various points in time from about 1840 down to the present.

== Late 19th century and early 20th century ==
Neo-romanticism as well as Romanticism is considered in opposition to naturalism—indeed, so far as music is concerned, naturalism is regarded as alien and even hostile . In the period following German unification in 1871, naturalism rejected Romantic literature as a misleading, idealistic distortion of reality. Naturalism in turn came to be regarded as incapable of filling the &quot;void&quot; of modern existence. Critics such as Hermann Bahr, Heinrich Mann, and Eugen Diederichs came to oppose naturalism and materialism under the banner of &quot;neo-romanticism&quot;, demanding a cultural reorientation responding to &quot;the soul&#x27;s longing for a meaning and content in life&quot; that might replace the fragmentations of modern knowledge with a holistic world view .
== Late 20th century ==
&quot;Neo-romanticism&quot; was proposed as an alternative label for the group of German composers identified with the short-lived &quot;Neue Einfachheit&quot; movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Along with other phrases such as &quot;new tonality&quot;, this term has been criticised for lack of precision because of the diversity among these composers, whose leading member is Wolfgang Rihm .

===1930–1955===
In British art history, the term &quot;neo-romanticism&quot; is applied to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s. It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic Raymond Mortimer in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as William Blake and Samuel Palmer, but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as Pablo Picasso, André Masson, and Pavel Tchelitchew (; ). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included Paul Nash, John Piper, Henry Moore, Ivon Hitchens, and especially Graham Sutherland. A younger generation included John Minton, Michael Ayrton, John Craxton, Keith Vaughan, Robert Colquhoun, and Robert MacBryde .

<text>The Commonwealth Secretariat is the main intergovernmental agency and central institution of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is responsible for facilitating co-operation between members; organising meetings, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM); assisting and advising on policy development; and providing assistance to countries in implementing the decisions and policies of the Commonwealth.

The Secretariat has observer status in the United Nations General Assembly. It is located at Marlborough House in London, the United Kingdom, a former royal residence that was given by Queen Elizabeth II, Head of the Commonwealth at the time. Today, the Head of the Commonwealth is King Charles III.

==History==

The Secretariat was established by the Heads of Government in 1965, taking over many of the functions of the United Kingdom Government&#x27;s Commonwealth Relations Office, as part of a major shake-up of the organisation of the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Secretariat was to serve as an &quot;information exchange&quot; for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. At the same time, the United Kingdom succeeded in advocating the creation of the Secretariat&#x27;s sister organisation, the Commonwealth Foundation, which was founded to foster non-governmental relations and the promotion of the Commonwealth Family network of civil societies. Other attempts by members to create similar central bodies, such as a medical conference (proposed by New Zealand), a development bank (Jamaica), and an institution for satellite communications (Canada) failed.

The creation of the Secretariat itself was a contentious issue. The United Kingdom and other long-established countries had hoped to slow the expansion of Commonwealth membership to prevent the dilution of their traditional power within the Commonwealth (particularly after the admission of Cyprus). The newer members of the Commonwealth wanted to reduce British power and influence, so formed the Secretariat which would be operated and financed by members from all Commonwealth countries. By diversifying the staff who worked in the Commonwealth, different points of view and perspectives would be seen. This may have involved a dual-tiered Commonwealth, requiring the continuation of the organisation of Commonwealth co-operation by meetings, rather than a central administration. However, the new African members were keener to create an independent inter-governmental &quot;central clearing house&quot; (as Ghana&#x27;s Kwame Nkrumah described it) to remove power from the older dominions. Milton Obote of Uganda was the first to propose a specifically titled &quot;secretariat&quot;, which was then formally proposed by Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, who wished to see it based upon the secretariats of the OAS, EEC, and OAU.

Earlier attempts at the formation of a central secretariat had failed. Australia had proposed the establishment four times (in 1907, 1924, 1932, and 1944), whilst New Zealand had also made proposals in 1909 and 1956. Finally, in July 1964, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers met in London to discuss the establishment of an independent secretariat for the Commonwealth. Many of these members agreed and were unopposed to this idea as they believed this Secretariat would help centralize and broaden the Commonwealth for all members, not solely on Britain.

=== The Rhodesian Crisis ===
Arnold Smith, a Canadian Diplomat, was the first Commonwealth Secretary-General with Amishadai Larson Adu (A. L. Adu) of Ghana and Tilak Gooneratne of Ceylon as the first deputy secretaries-general. In 1965, the Rhodesian Declaration of Independence was issued, gaining its sovereignty from the British in Southern Africa. Simultaneously, Smith was performing his first official visit as Secretary General to East and Central Africa. Due to his diplomatic peacemaking abilities, he was able to save the Commonwealth from dissolving due to clashing opinions. As a result, the prime ministers of the Commonwealth formed a sanctions committee that taught prime ministers how the sanctions they implemented on the &quot;illegal&quot; Salisbury regime were maintained, and a standing committee primarily focused on assisting to train Rhodesian Africans. More state crises occurred after, shifting the Secretariat&#x27;s dominant focus to peacemaking efforts. The Rhodesian Crisis proved the Commonwealth Secretariat&#x27;s competence and credibility as their professional diplomat skills allowed them to respond to crises immediately and efficiently.

==Staff==

The chief executive of the Secretariat, and of the Commonwealth as a whole, is the Commonwealth Secretary-General. All Secretariat staff report to the secretary-general, who is also responsible for spending the Secretariat&#x27;s budget, which is granted by the Heads of Government. It is the secretary-general, and not the ceremonial Head of the Commonwealth, that represents the Commonwealth publicly. The Head of the Commonwealth is more of a symbolic role, chosen by the Commonwealth leaders with no maximum set term. The secretary-general is elected by the Heads of Government at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings for a maximum of two terms of four years; until 2000, a term was five years. The current Secretary-General is Dominica&#x27;s Patricia Scotland, who replaced Kamalesh Sharma as secretary-general on 1 April 2016.

The secretary-general is assisted by three deputy secretaries-general: one responsible for economic affairs (currently Deodat Maharaj), one for political affairs (Josephine Ojiambo), and one for corporate affairs (Gary Dunn). The secretary-general may appoint junior staff at his own discretion, provided the Secretariat can afford it, whilst the more senior staff may be appointed only from a shortlist of nominations from the Heads of Government. In practice, the secretary-general has more power than this; member governments consult the secretary-general on nominations, and secretaries-general have also at times submitted nominations of their own.

The Commonwealth Chair-in-Office is responsible for the representing the Commonwealth at &quot;high-level international meetings and reinforces the Good Offices role of the Commonwealth Secretary-General.&quot; The &quot;Good Offices&quot; primarily focus on conflict resolution for the Commonwealth. The Current Commonwealth Chair-in-Office is the Samoan Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa who is responsible for hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). This role has a 2 year term limit which begins before the start of the CHOGM.

All members of staff are exempt from income tax, under the International Organisations Act 2005, which redefined the legal status of the Secretariat.

==Headquarters==
The Secretariat is headquartered at Marlborough House, in London, the United Kingdom. Marlborough House is located on Pall Mall, Westminster, next to St. James&#x27;s Palace, which is formally the location of the British Royal Court. Marlborough House was previously a royal residence in its own right, but was given by Queen Elizabeth II, the former Head of the Commonwealth, to the British government in September 1959 for use for Commonwealth purposes. This was first realised three years later. Another three years later, in 1965, the building passed to the Secretariat upon its foundation. The building itself was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and served as the London residence of the dukes of Marlborough until it was given to Princess Charlotte in 1817.

The Commonwealth Secretariat Act 1966, which applied retroactively from the establishment of the Secretariat in 1965, first granted the organisation full diplomatic immunity. This has been subjected to a number of lawsuits challenging this, including &quot;Mohsin v Commonwealth Secretariat&quot;, and in 2005, &quot;Sumukan Limited v Commonwealth Secretariat&quot;. The 1966 Act had been interpreted by English courts as allowing the courts to exercise supervisory jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act 1996 over the Commonwealth&#x27;s arbitration tribunal, which had been envisaged as the sole organ to arbitrate on matters related to the Secretariat&#x27;s operations in the United Kingdom. In light of this interpretation, the Commonwealth Secretariat Act was amended by the International Organisations Act 2005, which gave the Commonwealth Secretariat Arbitral Tribunal the same legal immunity as the Secretariat itself, guaranteeing independence of the English courts.

== Membership ==

The Commonwealth Secretariat comprises 56 independent countries, 33 small states (states with a population of 1.5 million or less), and 2.7 billion citizens. As of November 2007, when the Commonwealth Heads of Government held a meeting in Uganda, they reviewed and solidified the rules for membership into the Secretariat. The Commonwealth Secretariat outlines these membership rules:

# The applicant country should have had a past constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member.
# Applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis, except in save for exceptional circumstances.
# The applicant country is expected to abide by the fundamental values written out in the 1971 Declaration of Commonwealth Principles
# The applicant country should show commitment to democracy and its processes, such as &quot;free and fair elections and representative legislatures; the rule of law and independence of the judiciary; good governance, including a well-trained public service and transparent public accounts; and protection of human rights, freedom of expression, and equality of opportunity.&quot;
# The applicant country should embrace the Commonwealth norms and agreements, such as &quot;the use of the English language as the medium of inter-Commonwealth relations, and acknowledge His Majesty King Charles III as the Head of the Commonwealth.&quot;
# Lastly, newly admitted members are encouraged to join the Commonwealth Foundation and to advance strong civil society and business organizations within their respective countries, and promoting democratic practices.
Any country can join the Commonwealth Secretariat. Gabon and Togo were the most recent states to join in 2022.

=== Vision ===
The Commonwealth Secretariat aids in building and maintaining the Commonwealth where all member states are &quot;mutually respectful, resilient, peaceful and prosperous&quot; and values equality and diversity.

=== Mission ===
The Commonwealth Secretariat strives to support their member states and their governments through working with other Commonwealth states and globally promoting their shared values to benefit and improve the well-being of all individuals in the Commonwealth.

== Goals ==

=== Environment ===
The Secretariat focuses on protecting Commonwealth states and their environment by promoting sustainable practices for natural resources. The Commonwealth Climate Change Programme provides support and plans for member states to utilize in order to lessen the impacts of climate change and adapt to changing conditions. This program helps to facilitate an understanding and overview of the capacity member states have to meet their Paris Agreement commitments. Many different partnerships and procedures have been created to lend support to member states in tackling climate change such as the Commonwealth Finance Access Hub, CommonSensing, the Commonwealth Call to Action on Living Lands (CALL), the Commonwealth NDC Programme, the Gender Integration for Climate Action, and the Disaster Risk Finance Portal.

=== Trade and Economy ===
The Secretariat also strives to promote international trade between member states to aid in creating inclusive and sustainable economies, with a particular focus for the Commonwealth&#x27;s developed and developing countries. Their different programmes such as the Connectivity Agenda, Public Debt Management Programme, and Commonwealth Fintech Toolkit all help in improving global trade competitiveness, managing debt, and promoting sustainable methods for natural resources.

=== Democracy, Government, and Rule of Law ===
The Secretariat develops programmes to encourage democratic practices, good governance strategies, peace, and the rule of law. For example, many of these programmes include countering violent extremism, the promotion and protection of Human Rights, the Commonwealth Cyber Declaration Programme, and the Commonwealth Database on International Cooperation in Criminal Matters.

=== Society ===
The Secretariat emphasizes a focus for the younger generation in enhancing their potential through sports, universal healthcare, gender equality, education, and peacebuilding. These youth focused programs are meant to nurture growing generations into creating resilient and harmonic societies for the future. Commonwealth says NO MORE, Commonwealth Moves, and the Commonwealth Alliance for Quality Youth Leadership are a few examples of the efforts the Commonwealth has taken to implement change and development for society and young people.

=== Small States ===
The Secretariat aims to help its 33 small states by offering specialized support and aid to help improve their development challenges, such as dependence on trade, climate change, natural disasters, and limited access to funds. The Secretariat works toward this goal by advocating for international policies to include and consider small states&#x27; needs, aiding in building economic resilience, providing access to financing, and developing publications and reports that can help to create solutions for small states.

<doc id="212748" wikidata="Q565532" url="?curid=212748" title="Marlborough House">
<text>Marlborough House, a Grade I listed mansion on The Mall in St James&#x27;s, City of Westminster, London, is the headquarters of the Commonwealth of Nations and the seat of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It is adjacent to St James&#x27;s Palace. 

The house was built in 1711 for Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, the favourite and confidante of Queen Anne. For over a century it served as the London residence of the dukes of Marlborough. It became a royal residence through the 19th century and first half of the 20th. The house was expanded for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII, and became closely associated with the prince and his social circle in the Victorian era. His daughter in law, later Queen Mary, lived there when she was Princess of Wales and took a special, continuing interest in the house; she, like her mother-in-law Queen Alexandra before her, returned to live there in her widowhood and memorials to both queens are on its grounds. The building was leased by Queen Elizabeth II to the Commonwealth Secretariat beginning in 1965.

==Construction==

In 1708, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough was granted a 50-year lease of the site from the Crown Estate at a low rent from Queen Anne, which beforehand had been partly occupied by the pheasantry adjoining St. James&#x27;s Palace, and partly by the gardens of Henry Boyle, Queen Anne&#x27;s Secretary of State. The Duke left his wife entirely in charge of the design and building of Marlborough House; she wanted her new home to be &quot;strong, plain and convenient and good&quot;. The architect Christopher Wren and his son of the same name designed a two-story brick building with rusticated stone quoins that was completed in 1711. The stonework and ornamentation were built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger. The Duke purchased the bricks cheaply in Holland while on campaign, and had them transported to England as ballast in the empty troop ships on their return journeys from depositing British troops. Throughout the building process, the Duchess kept a close watch on even the smallest details and quarreled with the Wrens over the contractors they had hired. This led John Vanbrugh to joke that the Duchess had &quot;the direction in chief to herself, with Sir Christopher Wren as her Deputy Surveyor.&quot; Eventually she dismissed the Wrens and took control of the design herself.

In 1727, Sarah&#x27;s political rival Sir Robert Walpole purchased the lot between Marlborough House and Pall Mall through his protégé Thomas Ripley, reputedly to deny the Duchess a direct entrance onto Pall Mall. Wren had designed and built a gateway arch and screen in the front courtyard with this entrance in mind, which survives as a grotto. Still intent on an entrance from Pall Mall, in 1729 the Duchess leased four houses to the west and had them demolished to create a &quot;poky&quot; diagonal entrance.

In the 1770s, the 4th Duke of Marlborough hired the architect Sir William Chambers to add a third storey to the house and architectural details like new ceilings and chimneypieces.

==Royal residence==

After the fourth duke&#x27;s death in 1817 ownership was taken up by the Crown so the building could be used as the residence of Princess Charlotte of Wales and her husband Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the location of the house (north of The Mall and east of St James&#x27;s Palace) making it convenient as a Royal Residence. The Princess died before the purchase was completed, and so her widower lived there alone for some time. He was offered the Belgian throne in the house on 22 April 1831. In the 1820s plans were drawn up to demolish Marlborough House and replace it with a terrace of similar dimensions to the two in neighbouring Carlton House Terrace, and this idea even featured on some contemporary maps, including Christopher and John Greenwood&#x27;s large-scale London map of 1830, but the proposal was not implemented.

After Leopold became King of Belgium and left Britain, Marlborough House continued to be primarily used by members of the Royal Family, Queen Adelaide being given the use of Marlborough House from 1831 until her death in 1849. Following Queen Adelaide&#x27;s death, Queen Victoria asked Parliament to allow the Prince of Wales to live there when he turned nineteen. From May to September 1852, the Museum of Manufactures, a predecessor of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, housed its collections in Marlborough House. From 1853 to 1861 Prince Albert arranged for the building to be used by the &quot;National Art Training School&quot;, later the Royal College of Art.

From 1861 to 1863, Sir James Pennethorne substantially enlarged the structure by adding a range of rooms on the north side and a deep porch for the Prince and Princess of Wales, later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, who made their home the social centre of London. Their second son, the future King George V, was born at Marlborough House in 1865, and the family lived there until Queen Victoria died in 1901, when Edward acceded to the throne and they moved to nearby Buckingham Palace. From the 1880s the term ‘Marlborough House Set’ came into usage to denote the Prince of Wales&#x27;s fast-living social circle, which included gamblers, bankers, and other &quot;raffish&quot; individuals.

After his father moved to Buckingham Palace in 1901, Edward VII&#x27;s son George, now Prince of Wales, took up residence with his wife Mary and their children. Mary extensively redecorated to make the home more comfortable, and was reluctant to move to Buckingham Palace after her husband became George V in 1910. Following this, Queen Alexandra once again made Marlborough House her London home, until her death in 1925. A late Art Nouveau-Gothic memorial fountain by Alfred Gilbert (1926–32) in the Marlborough Road wall of the house commemorates her.
In 1936, Marlborough House became the London residence of George V&#x27;s widow, Queen Mary, who survived George by 17 years. In the grounds of the house remains her pet cemetery. A thatch-roofed rotating summer house built for her is still in place. A plaque to commemorate Queen Mary was unveiled in 1967.

==Commonwealth Secretariat==
After Queen Mary&#x27;s death in 1953, Marlborough House continued to be used by various members of the royal family as a London residence before Queen Elizabeth II leased it to the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1965, an arrangement which continues today.

The Gambia Independence Act 1964 was signed at Marlborough House, before its independence on 18 February 1965.

==Features==

The nearly cubical saloon retains wall-paintings by Louis Laguerre of the Battle of Blenheim (at which the 1st Duke of Marlborough was overall commander for Britain and her allies; seat of the dukes of Marlborough is Blenheim Palace, one of England&#x27;s largest houses). A cupola inserted in the ceiling is surrounded by paintings by Orazio Gentileschi and Artemisia Gentileschi for the Queen&#x27;s House, Greenwich, 1636. There are paired staircases flanking the saloon, with further battle pieces by Laguerre. Most of the interiors have been altered.

==Public opening times==
Marlborough House is usually open to the public for Open House Weekend each September. The house is also open for group tours by prior arrangement.

<doc id="212756" wikidata="Q37892" url="?curid=212756" title="Chinese Crested Dog">
<text>The Chinese Crested Dog is a hairless breed of dog. Like most hairless dog breeds, the Chinese Crested Dog comes in two varieties, without hair and with hair, which can be born in the same litter: the hairless and the powderpuff.

== Description ==

The Chinese Crested is considered an extra small breed, weighing on average . The height is 11 to 13 inches (27–33 cm). The breed is fine-boned, with almond-shaped eyes and large, erect ears. There is no color standard for the breed.

At first look, the hairless and powderpuff varieties of Chinese Crested Dogs appear to be two different breeds, but hairlessness is an incomplete dominant trait within a single breed. The Hairless has soft, humanlike skin, as well as tufts of hair on its paws (&quot;socks&quot;) and tail (&quot;plume&quot;) and long, flowing hair on its head (&quot;crest&quot;). In addition to being an incomplete dominant gene, the &quot;hairless&quot; gene has a prenatal lethal effect when homozygous. Zygotes affected with double hairless genes never develop into puppies, and are reabsorbed in the womb. All hairless Chinese Crested Dogs are therefore heterozygous.

The hairless variety can vary in amount of body hair. Hair on the muzzle, known as a beard, is not uncommon. A true hairless often does not have as much furnishings (hair on the head, tail, and paws). The difference between a hairless with a copious amount of hair and a powderpuff is that the hairless has a single coat with hairless parts on the body, while the powderpuff has a thick double coat. The skin of the hairless comes in a variety of colors, ranging from a pale flesh to black. Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs often lack a full set of premolar teeth, but this is not considered a fault.

A powderpuff has a long, soft coat. Both hairless and powderpuff varieties can appear in the same litter. The look of the powderpuff varies according to how it is groomed. When its hair is completely grown out on its face, it strongly resembles a terrier; however, the powderpuff is usually shaved around the snout as a standard cut. The powderpuff Chinese Crested Dog is an elegant and graceful dog who makes a loving companion, playful and entertaining. The powderpuff&#x27;s coat is long and silky soft.

The amount of body hair on the Hairless variety varies quite extensively, from the true hairless which has very little or no body hair and furnishings, to what is called a &quot;hairy hairless&quot; dog, which, if left ungroomed, often grows a near-full coat of hair. These hairy hairless dogs are not a mix between powderpuffs and hairless Chinese Crested Dogs, but are merely a result of a weaker expression of the variable hairless gene. The mutation responsible for the hairless trait was identified in 2008.

== Care ==

Both varieties require certain amounts of grooming. The powderpuff is entirely covered with a double, very soft, straight coat. Although a powderpuff&#x27;s coat does not continuously grow, it can grow to be quite long at full length; a weekly bath and frequent brushing typically helps to prevent matting. For an optimal coat, it is recommended not to brush the dog&#x27;s coat when dry or dirty, as a light spray of water or grooming spray to their coat is recommended before brushing. Many choose to shave their powderpuff in a &quot;pony cut&quot; leaving long hair on the bottom of legs, tail, head and crest for an easy care coat. The breed has &quot;little to no shedding&quot;.

Maintenance of the hairless variety&#x27;s skin is similar to maintaining human skin and as such it can be susceptible to acne, dryness, and sunburn. Hypoallergenic or oil-free moisturizing cream can keep the skin from becoming too dry when applied every other day or after bathing. Burning can occur in regions that are subject to strong UV radiation, especially in lighter-skinned dogs. Many owners apply baby sunscreen to their pets before spending time in strong sun. Some Chinese Crested Dogs have skin allergies to lanolin.

Unless the dog is a &quot;true&quot; hairless (one with virtually no hair growth on non-extremities), trimming and/or shaving is often performed to remove excess hair growth.

The Chinese Crested Dog is further distinguished by its &quot;hare foot&quot; (having more elongated toes), as opposed to the &quot;cat foot&quot; common to most other dogs. Because of this, the quicks of Cresteds run deeper into their nails, so care must be taken not to trim the nails too short to avoid pain and bleeding.

Powderpuffs enjoy going outdoors for daily exercise, although they are not a high energy breed. Being an intelligent breed, this dog does well in obedience type sports. Consistency is a must; however, this breed can be relatively sensitive and should have a gentle trainer. The powderpuff is adept at learning and performing tricks.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Hairless varieties of the Cresteds can be prone to poor dentition. Poor dentition may include missing or crowded teeth and teeth prone to decay when not properly cared for. Most dogs of the Powderpuff variety have few, if any, dental defects.

Eye problems are a concern within the breed, which has a higher incidence of primary lens luxation (PLL) than most other breeds. The Chinese Crested Dog can also have at least two forms of progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) which can eventually lead to blindness as well. For PLL and one of the forms of PRA, a genetic test can be performed to determine if a dog is a &#x27;carrier&#x27;, &#x27;clear&#x27;, or &#x27;affected&#x27;. Since the test can only reveal the existence of affected or carrier status of one form of PRA, breeders and owners of the breed should still have regular eye exams by veterinary ophthalmologists. The breed also suffers from another eye disease called keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye syndrome (DES).

Along with Kerry Blue Terriers, Chinese Crested Dogs can develop canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD) also called progressive neuronal abiotrophy (PNA) in Kerry Blue Terriers. This is a progressive movement disorder that begins with cerebellar ataxia between 10 and 14 weeks of age. After 6 months of age, affected dogs develop difficulty initiating movements and fall frequently. The gene responsible has been mapped to canine chromosome 1.

As with all other toy breeds, the Chinese Crested Dog can be prone to patellar luxation. This inheritable condition is caused by shallow knee joints (stifles) and results in kneecaps that pop out of place. Onset is often at a young age, and can cause temporary to permanent lameness based on the severity. Breeders should have their stock certified free of patellar luxation. Many countries&#x27; kennel clubs maintain a centralised registry for health results.

The Chinese Crested is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary lens luxation which is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene.

== History ==
Although hairless dogs have been found in many places in the world, it is unlikely that the origins of the modern Chinese Crested Dog are in China. The same genetic mutation shared with the Xoloitzcuintli leads to the theory that they have a shared origin. It is thought the origins of the modern Chinese Crested dog are either Africa or, more likely, Mexico.

Spanish explorers found Chinese Crested dogs in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America as early as the 1500s. British, French, and Portuguese explorers likewise found the breed in various parts of Africa and Asia during the 1700s and 1800s.

In the 1950s, Debora Wood created the &quot;Crest Haven&quot; kennel and began to purposefully breed and record the lineages of her Chinese Crested Dogs. The famous burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee also bred Chinese Crested Dogs, and upon her death her dogs were incorporated into Crest Haven. These two lines are the true foundation of every Chinese Crested Dog alive today. Ms. Wood also founded the American Hairless Dog Club in 1959, which was eventually incorporated into the American Chinese Crested Club (ACCC) in 1978. The ACCC became the US parent club for the breed when the Chinese Crested Dog was recognized by the American Kennel Club 13 years later, in 1991.

The Chinese Crested Dog was officially recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1987 and by the American Kennel Club in 1991.

== Genetics ==

Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs are heterozygous for the mutation that causes hairlessness. The allele that causes hairlessness is lethal &quot;in utero&quot; when inherited as a homozygous dominant trait. Powderpuffs are homozygous recessive for the trait.

== In popular culture ==
A hairless purebred Chinese Crested Dog named Sam was the winner of the World&#x27;s Ugliest Dog Contest from 2003 to 2005.

<text>&quot;Jamaica, Land We Love&quot; is the national anthem of Jamaica, officially adopted in July 1962. It was chosen after a competition from September 1961 to 31 March 1962, in which the lyrics of the national anthem were selected by Jamaica&#x27;s Houses of Parliament. When Jamaica was granted independence on 6 August 1962, &quot;Jamaica, Land We Love&quot; continued to be officially used as the national anthem. 

==History==
Prior to the declaration of the independence of Jamaica, Jamaica was made a West Indies Federation province of the British West Indies, still under the rule of the United Kingdom. The nation entered the federation under the rule of Premier Norman Manley, who also made various constitutional amendments to allow the process of decolonisation to rapidly take place. These amendments also allowed the country to have more self-governing powers and permitted the formation of a cabinet led by a premier. Premier Norman Manley&#x27;s participation in the West Indies Federation was unpopular and led to the independence of the country on 6 August 1962, and the national anthem selected in July 1962 was officially used from that date.

In September 1961, the leading People&#x27;s National Party announced a competition to write the lyrics of Jamaica&#x27;s future national anthem, which would be judged by selected members of Jamaica&#x27;s Houses of Parliament. The competition received almost 100 script entries, and the competition closed on 31 March 1962, after this ending date was decided on 17 March. The Houses of Parliament were given two options of anthems to vote for on 19 July 1962, and a script was chosen with an overwhelming majority. The winning script was written by Reverend Hon. Hugh Sherlock, the music was composed by Hon. Robert Lightbourne, and the anthem was arranged by Mapletoft Poulle and Christine Alison Poulle. The Jamaican national anthem, &quot;Jamaica, Land We Love,&quot; was originally performed at the National Stadium in Kingston, on August 6, 1962, during the official independence ceremonies. 

== Use ==

=== Salutes ===

Everyone should stand at attention for the National Anthem, with males removing their caps. Those in uniform should salute. The Governor-General and Prime Minister&#x27;s arrival and departure will be marked by the performance or playing of the opening verse of the National Anthem. Furthermore, singing the National Anthem should be incorporated into the process of raising and lowering the flag at the beginning and end of each school year, as well as during Independence Day celebrations.

=== Other uses ===
The anthem has appeared in television shows and documentaries on Jamaican culture and history. It is commonly used for national festivals and television broadcasts, including Independence Day and athletic events starring Jamaican athletes. During sign-off sequences in Jamaica, television and radio stations customarily play the national anthem &quot;Jamaica, Land We Love.&quot; This custom honors an era when broadcasting was not a 24-hour operation, with stations suspending operations overnight. As an example, Television Jamaica and Radio Jamaica are recognized for incorporating the national anthem into their sign-off routines. At the conclusion of their daily broadcasts, these stations traditionally play the anthem, marking a formal end to their programming before they cease transmission.

<doc id="212764" wikidata="Q74445146" url="?curid=212764" title="Superluminous supernova">
<text>A super-luminous supernova (SLSN, plural super luminous supernovae or SLSNe) is a type of stellar explosion with a luminosity 10 or more times higher than that of standard supernovae. Like supernovae, SLSNe seem to be produced by several mechanisms, which is readily revealed by their light-curves and spectra. There are multiple models for what conditions may produce an SLSN, including core collapse in particularly massive stars, millisecond magnetars, interaction with circumstellar material (CSM model), or pair-instability supernovae.
The first confirmed superluminous supernova connected to a gamma ray burst was not found until 2003, when GRB 030329 illuminated the Leo constellation. SN 2003dh represented the death of a star 25 times more massive than the Sun, with material being blasted out at over a tenth the speed of light.

Stars with are likely to produce superluminous supernovae.

==Classification==
Discoveries of many SLSNe in the 21st century showed that not only were they more luminous by an order of magnitude than most supernovae, their remnants were also unlikely to be powered by the typical radioactive decay that is responsible for the observed energies of conventional supernovae.

SLSNe events use a separate classification scheme to distinguish them from the conventional type Ia, type Ib/Ic, and type II supernovae, roughly distinguishing between the spectral signature of hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor events.

Hydrogen-rich SLSNe are classified as Type SLSN-II, with observed radiation passing through the changing opacity of a thick expanding hydrogen envelope. Most hydrogen-poor events are classified as Type SLSN-I, with its visible radiation produced from a large expanding envelope of material powered by an unknown mechanism. A third less common group of SLSNe is also hydrogen-poor and abnormally luminous, but clearly powered by radioactivity from 56Ni.

Increasing number of discoveries find that some SLSNe do not fit cleanly into these three classes, so further sub-classes or unique events have been described. Many or all SLSN-I show spectra without hydrogen or helium but have lightcurves comparable to conventional type Ic supernovae, and are now classed as SLSN-Ic. PS1-10afx is an unusually red hydrogen-free SLSN with an extremely rapid rise to a near-record peak luminosity and an unusually rapid decline. PS1-11ap is similar to a type Ic SLSN but has an unusually slow rise and decline.

==Astrophysical models ==
A wide variety of causes have been proposed to explain events that are an order of magnitude or more greater than standard supernovae. The collapsar and CSM (circumstellar material) models are generally accepted and a number of events are well-observed. Other models are still only tentatively accepted or remain entirely theoretical.

===Collapsar model===
The collapsar model is a type of superluminous supernova that produces a gravitationally collapsed object, or black hole. The word &quot;collapsar&quot;, short for &quot;collapsed star&quot;, was formerly used to refer to the end product of stellar gravitational collapse, a stellar-mass black hole. The word is now sometimes used to refer to a specific model for the collapse of a fast-rotating star. When core collapse occurs in a star with a core at least around fifteen times the Sun&#x27;s mass ()—though chemical composition and rotational rate are also significant—the explosion energy is insufficient to expel the outer layers of the star, and it will collapse into a black hole without producing a visible supernova outburst.

A star with a core mass slightly below this level—in the range of —will undergo a supernova explosion, but so much of the ejected mass falls back onto the core remnant that it still collapses into a black hole. If such a star is rotating slowly, then it will produce a faint supernova, but if the star is rotating quickly enough, then the fallback to the black hole will produce relativistic jets. The energy that these jets transfer into the ejected shell renders the visible outburst substantially more luminous than a standard supernova. The jets also beam high energy particles and gamma rays directly outward and thereby produce x-ray or gamma-ray bursts; the jets can last for several seconds or longer and correspond to long-duration gamma-ray bursts, but they do not appear to explain short-duration gamma-ray bursts.

Stars with cores have an approximate total mass of , assuming the star has not undergone significant mass loss. Such a star will still have a hydrogen envelope and will explode as a Type II supernova. Faint Type II supernovae have been observed, but no definite candidates for a Type II SLSN (except type IIn, which are not thought to be jet supernovae). Only the very lowest metallicity population III stars will reach this stage of their life with little mass loss. Other stars, including most of those visible to us, will have had most of their outer layers blown away by their high luminosity and become Wolf-Rayet stars. Some theories propose these will produce either Type Ib or Type Ic supernovae, but none of these events so far has been observed in nature. Many observed SLSNe are likely Type Ic. Those associated with gamma-ray bursts are almost always Type Ic, being very good candidates for having relativistic jets produced by fallback to a black hole. However, not all Type Ic SLSNe correspond to observed gamma-ray bursts but the events would only be visible if one of the jets were aimed towards us.

In recent years, much observational data on long-duration gamma-ray bursts have significantly increased our understanding of these events and made clear that the collapsar model produces explosions that differ only in detail from more or less ordinary supernovae and have energy ranges from approximately normal to around 100 times larger.

A good example of a collapsar SLSN is SN 1998bw, which was associated with the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425. It is classified as a type Ic supernova due to its distinctive spectral properties in the radio spectrum, indicating the presence of relativistic matter.

===Circumstellar material model===
Almost all observed SLSNe have had spectra similar to either a type Ic or type IIn supernova. The type Ic SLSNe are thought to be produced by jets from fallback to a black hole, but type IIn SLSNe have significantly different light curves and are not associated with gamma-ray bursts. Type IIn supernovae are all embedded in a dense nebula probably expelled from the progenitor star itself, and this circumstellar material (CSM) is thought to be the cause of the extra luminosity. When material expelled in an initial normal supernova explosion meets dense nebular material or dust close to the star, the shockwave converts kinetic energy efficiently into visible radiation. This effect greatly enhances these extended duration and extremely luminous supernovae, even though the initial explosive energy was the same as that of normal supernovae.

Although any supernova type could potentially produce Type IIn SLSNe, theoretical constraints on the surrounding CSM sizes and densities do suggest that it will almost always be produced from the central progenitor star itself immediately prior to the observed supernova event. Such stars are likely candidates of hypergiants or LBVs that appear to be undergoing substantial mass loss, due to Eddington instability, for example, SN2005gl.

===Pair-instability supernova===

Another type of suspected SLSN is a pair-instability supernova, of which SN 2006gy may possibly be the first observed example. This supernova event was observed in a galaxy about 238 million light years (73 megaparsecs) from Earth.

The theoretical basis for pair-instability collapse has been known for many decades and was suggested as a dominant source of higher mass elements in the early universe as super-massive population III stars exploded. In a pair-instability supernova, the pair production effect causes a sudden pressure drop in the star&#x27;s core, leading to a rapid partial collapse. Gravitational potential energy from the collapse causes runaway fusion of the core which entirely disrupts the star, leaving no remnant.

Models show that this phenomenon only happens in stars with extremely low metallicity and masses between about 130 and 260 times the Sun, making them extremely unlikely in the local universe. Although originally expected to produce SLSN explosions hundreds of times greater than a normal supernova, current models predict that they actually produce luminosities ranging from about the same as a normal core collapse supernova to perhaps 50 times brighter, although remaining bright for much longer.

===Magnetar energy release===
Models of the creation and subsequent spin-down of a magnetar yield much higher luminosities than regular supernova events and match the observed properties of at least some SLSNe. In cases where pair-instability supernova may not be a good fit for explaining a SLSN, a magnetar explanation is more plausible.

===Other models===
There are still models for SLSN explosions produced from binary systems, white dwarf or neutron stars in unusual arrangements or undergoing mergers, and some of these are proposed to account for some observed gamma-ray bursts.

<text>The Trochozoa are a proposed Lophotrochozoa clade that is a sister clade of Bryozoa and Platyzoa. The clade would include animals in five phyla: the Nemertea, the Annelida, the Mollusca, and the two Brachiozoan phyla, Brachiopoda and Phoronida. Both annelids and molluscs have been suggested as the sister group of Brachiozoa. It has also been proposed that nemerteans are actually a clade of annelids.

<text>Ram Dass (born Richard Alpert; April 6, 1931 – December 22, 2019), also known as Baba Ram Dass, was an American spiritual teacher, guru of modern yoga, psychologist, and writer. His best-selling 1971 book &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, which has been described by multiple reviewers as &quot;seminal&quot;, helped popularize Eastern spirituality and yoga in the West. He authored or co-authored twelve more books on spirituality over the next four decades, including &quot;Grist for the Mill&quot; (1977), &quot;How Can I Help?&quot; (1985), and &quot;Polishing the Mirror&quot; (2013).

Ram Dass was personally and professionally associated with Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Then known as Richard Alpert, he conducted research with Leary on the therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs. In addition, Alpert assisted Harvard Divinity School graduate student Walter Pahnke in his 1962 &quot;Good Friday Experiment&quot; with theology students, the first controlled, double-blind study of drugs and the mystical experience. While not illegal at the time, their research was controversial and led to Leary&#x27;s and Alpert&#x27;s dismissal from Harvard in 1963.

In 1967, Alpert traveled to India and became a disciple of Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba, who gave him the name Ram Dass, meaning &quot;Servant of Ram,&quot; but usually rendered simply as &quot;Servant of God&quot; for Western audiences. In the following years, he co-founded the charitable organizations Seva Foundation and Hanuman Foundation. From the 1970s to the 1990s, he traveled extensively, giving talks and retreats and holding fundraisers for charitable causes. In 1997, he had a stroke, which left him with paralysis and expressive aphasia. He eventually grew to interpret this event as an act of grace, learning to speak again and continuing to teach and write books. After becoming seriously ill during a trip to India in 2004, he gave up traveling and moved to Maui, Hawaii, where he hosted annual retreats with other spiritual teachers until his death in 2019.

==Early life==
Ram Dass was born Richard Alpert in 1931. His parents were Gertrude (Levin) and George Alpert, a lawyer in Boston. He considered himself an atheist during his early life. Speaking at Berkeley Community Theater in 1973 he said, &quot;My Jewish trip was primarily political Judaism, I mean I was never Bar Mitzvahed, confirmed, and so on.&quot; In a 2006 article in &quot;Tufts Magazine&quot; he was quoted by Sara Davidson, describing himself as &quot;inured to religion. I didn&#x27;t have one whiff of God until I took psychedelics.&quot; He was also interviewed by Arthur J. Magida at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, who published the interview in 2008, quoting Ram Dass as saying &quot;What I mostly remember about my bar mitzvah was that it was an empty ritual. It was flat. Absolutely flat. There was a disappointing hollowness to the moment. There was nothing, nothing, nothing in it for my heart.&quot;

===Education===
Alpert attended the Williston Northampton School, graduating cum laude in 1948. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Tufts University in 1952. His father had wanted him to go to medical school, but while at Tufts he decided to study psychology instead. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Wesleyan University in 1954, he was recommended to Stanford University by his mentor at Wesleyan, David McClelland. Alpert wrote his doctoral thesis on &quot;achievement anxiety&quot;, receiving his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford in 1957. Alpert then taught at Stanford for one year, and began psychoanalysis.

===Harvard professorship===
McClelland moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to teach at Harvard University, and helped Alpert accept a tenure-track position there in 1958 as an assistant clinical psychology professor. Alpert worked with the Social Relations Department, the Psychology Department, the Graduate School of Education, and the Health Service, where he was a therapist. He specialized in human motivation and personality development, and published his first book &quot;Identification and Child Rearing&quot;.

McClelland did work with his close friend and associate Timothy Leary, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the university. Alpert and Leary had met through McClelland, who headed the Center for Research in Personality where Alpert and Leary both did research. Alpert was McClelland&#x27;s deputy in the lab.

====Harvard projects====
After returning from a visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1961, Alpert devoted himself to joining Leary in experimentation with and intensive research into the potentially therapeutic effects of hallucinogenic drugs such as psilocybin, LSD-25, and other psychedelic chemicals, through their Harvard Psilocybin Project. Alpert and Leary co-founded the non-profit International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF) in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in order to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs, and were both on the board of directors.

Alpert assisted Harvard Divinity School graduate student Walter Pahnke in his 1962 &quot;Good Friday Experiment&quot; with theology students, the first controlled, double-blind study of drugs and the mystical experience.

====Dismissal from Harvard====
Leary and Alpert were formally dismissed from Harvard in 1963. According to Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey, Leary was dismissed for leaving Cambridge and his classes without permission or notice, and Alpert for allegedly giving psilocybin to an undergraduate.

===Millbrook and psychedelic counterculture (1963–1967)===
In 1963 Alpert, Leary, and their followers moved to the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York, after IFIF&#x27;s New York City branch director and Mellon fortune heiress Peggy Hitchcock arranged for her brother Billy to rent the estate to IFIF. Alpert and Leary immediately set up a communal group with former Harvard Psilocybin Project members at the estate (commonly known as &quot;Millbrook&quot;), and the IFIF was subsequently disbanded and renamed the Castalia Foundation (after the intellectual colony in Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;).

The core group at Millbrook, whose journal was the &quot;Psychedelic Review&quot;, sought to cultivate the divinity within each person. At Millbrook, they experimented with psychedelics and often participated in group LSD sessions, looking for a permanent route to higher consciousness. The Castalia Foundation hosted weekend retreats on the estate where people paid to undergo the psychedelic experience without drugs, through meditation, yoga, and group therapy sessions.

Alpert and Leary co-authored &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot; with Ralph Metzner, based on the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, published in 1964. Alpert co-authored &quot;LSD&quot; with Sidney Cohen and Lawrence Schiller in 1966.

In 1967 Alpert gave talks at the League for Spiritual Discovery&#x27;s center in Greenwich Village.

==Spiritual search and name change==
In 1967, Alpert traveled to India where he met American spiritual seeker Bhagavan Das, and later met Neem Karoli Baba.

=== Neem Karoli Baba ===
In 1967, Bhagavan Das guided Alpert throughout India, eventually introducing him to Neem Karoli Baba, whom Alpert called &quot;Maharaj-ji&quot;, who became his guru at Kainchi ashram. Neem Karoli Baba gave Alpert the name &quot;Ram Dass&quot;, which means &quot;servant of God&quot;, referring to the incarnation of God as Ram or Lord Rama. Alpert also corresponded with Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba and mentioned Baba in several of his books.

Alpert was curious about the guru&#x27;s take on LSD. The day after their first meeting, Neem Karoli Baba asked Alpert to give him the &quot;medicine&quot;. Alpert gave him one dose of &quot;white lightning&quot;, but he asked for 2 more tabs (915 μg or 9 times the average dose); after trying them, the LSD seemed to have no psychotropic effect on Neem Karoli Baba, but instead told him that the same state could be achieved through meditation and that he could live in that state. After this, Neem Karoli Baba became Richard Alpert&#x27;s guru, and gave him the name &quot;Ram Dass&quot;, which means &quot;servant of God&quot;, referring to the incarnation of God as Ram or Lord Rama. Ram Dass called his new guru &quot;Maharaj-ji&quot;, and studied with him the following four years.

===&quot;Be Here Now&quot;===
After Alpert returned to America as Ram Dass, he stayed as a guest at the Lama Foundation in Taos, New Mexico. Ram Dass had helped Steve Durkee (Nooruddeen Durkee) and Barbara Durkee (Asha Greer or Asha von Briesen) co-found the countercultural, spiritual community in 1967, and it had an ashram dedicated to Ram Dass&#x27;s guru. During Ram Dass&#x27;s visit, he presented a manuscript he had written, entitled &quot;From Bindu to Ojas&quot;. The community&#x27;s residents edited, illustrated, and laid out the text, which ultimately became a best-selling book when published under the name &quot;Be Here Now&quot; in 1971. The 416-page manual for conscious being was published by the Lama Foundation, as Ram Dass&#x27;s benefit for the community. &quot;Be Here Now&quot; contained Ram Dass&#x27;s account of his spiritual journey, as well as recommended spiritual techniques and quotes. It became a popular guide to New Age spirituality, selling two million copies. The proceeds helped sustain the Lama Foundation for several years, after which they donated the book&#x27;s copyright and half its proceeds to the Hanuman Foundation in Taos.

&quot;Be Here Now&quot; is one of the first guides for those not born Hindu to becoming a yogi. For its influence on the hippie movement and subsequent spiritual movements, it has been described as a &quot;countercultural bible&quot; and &quot;seminal&quot; to the era. In addition to introducing its title phrase into common use, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; has influenced numerous other writers and yoga practitioners, including the Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, the self-help writer Wayne Dyer, and the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

The first section of the book inspired the lyrics to George Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, written in 1971 and released on his 1973 album &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;.

==Foundations and Living/Dying Project==
During the 1970s, Ram Dass taught, wrote, and worked with foundations. He founded the Hanuman Foundation, a nonprofit educational and service organization that initiated the Prison-Ashram Project (now known as the Human Kindness Foundation), in 1974. The Hanuman Foundation strives to improve the spiritual well-being of society through education, media and community service programs. 

In 1978, Ram Dass co-founded the Seva Foundation with public health leader Larry Brilliant and humanitarian activist Wavy Gravy. The foundation joined with health-care workers to treat the blind in India, Nepal, and developing countries. It has become an international health organization.

In the early 1970s, Ram Dass taught workshops on conscious aging and dying around the United States. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was one of his students. Ram Dass helped create the Dying Project with its Executive Director Dale Borglum, whom he had met in India. At the time, Borglum was also executive director of the Hanuman Foundation. The Living/Dying Project, based in Marin, California, starting in 1986, was initially named the Dying Center and located in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Dying Center was the first residential facility in the U.S. where people came to die &quot;consciously&quot;.

In 1981, he appeared on an Australian radio documentary about death and near-death experiences that aired on the ABC, &quot;And When I Die, Will I Be Dead?&quot; It was adapted into a book in 1987.
Ram Dass also served on the faculty of the Metta Institute where he provided training on mindful and compassionate care of the dying.

The Love Serve Remember Foundation was organized to preserve and continue the teachings of Neem Karoli Baba and Ram Dass. 

Over the course of his life, since the inception of the Hanuman Foundation, Ram Dass donated his book royalties and profits from teaching to his foundation and other charitable causes. The annual estimate of the earnings he donated ranges from $100,000 to $800,000.

==Later life==
His guru, Neem Karoli Baba, died on 11 September 1973. 

Timothy Leary and Ram Dass, who had grown apart after Ram Dass denounced Leary in a 1974 news conference, reconciled in 1983 at Harvard (at a reunion for the 20th anniversary of their controversial firing from the Harvard faculty), and reunited before Leary&#x27;s death in May 1996.

Ram Dass explored Judaism seriously for the first time when he was 60 years old. He wrote, &quot;My belief is that I wasn&#x27;t born into Judaism by accident, and so I needed to find ways to honor that&quot;, and &quot;From a Hindu perspective, you are born as what you need to deal with, and if you just try and push it away, whatever it is, it&#x27;s got you.&quot;

In February 1997, Ram Dass had a stroke that left him with expressive aphasia, which he interpreted as an act of grace. He stated, &quot;The stroke was giving me lessons, and I realized that was grace—fierce grace ... Death is the biggest change we&#x27;ll face, so we need to practice change.&quot; 

After he almost died from a second stroke during a trip to India in 2004, Ram Dass moved to Maui. In 2013, Ram Dass released a memoir and summary of his teaching, &quot;Polishing the Mirror: How to Live from Your Spiritual Heart&quot;. In an interview about the book, at age 82, he said that his earlier reflections about facing old age and death now seem naive to him. He said, in part: &quot;Now, I&#x27;m in my 80s ... Now, I am aging. I am approaching death. I&#x27;m getting closer to the end. ... Now, I really am ready to face the music all around me.&quot;

Ram Dass did not leave the Hawaiian Islands until July 2019, when he attended the consecration of a new Hanuman Mandir in Taos, New Mexico, on July 13, 2019, after which he returned to Hawaii and continued to make public appearances and to give talks at small venues; held retreats in Maui; and continued to teach through live webcasts.

Ram Dass died in Maui, on December 22, 2019, at the age of 88.

==Personal life==
In the 1990s, Ram Dass discussed his bisexuality. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve started to talk more about being bisexual, being involved with men as well as women,&quot; and added his opinion that for him, his sexuality &quot;isn&#x27;t gay, and it&#x27;s not not-gay, and it&#x27;s not anything—it&#x27;s just awareness.&quot;

At 78, Ram Dass learned that he had fathered a son as a 24-year-old at Stanford, during a brief relationship with history major Karen Saum, and that he was now a grandfather. The fact came to light when his son, Peter Reichard, a 53-year-old banker in North Carolina, took a DNA test after learning about his mother&#x27;s doubt concerning his parentage.

<text>Richard Alpert (born April 11, 1947) is an American sculptor, abstract filmmaker, and performance artist. He is also known for his work in &quot;Generating Art&quot; and received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant in Sculpture in 1979. In 1986 he was nearly killed in a fire that destroyed his studio and much of his artwork.

==Career==
===Education===
Richard Alpert was born on April 11, 1947, in New York City, New York. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in studio arts from the University of Pittsburgh in 1970, and an MFA in sculpture from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1973.

===Career in the 1970s===
In the 1970s Alpert&#x27;s conceptual and performance art included the performance sculpture &quot;Strategy for a Dance&quot;; the video works &quot;Post Time&quot;, &quot;A Circular Route&quot;, &quot;The Opacity of Order&quot;, and &quot;Facture&quot;; the article and collection &quot;South of the Slot&quot;; the printed works &quot;Women: On Our Way&quot; and &quot;Stretch&quot;; and the performances &quot;Hand Generated Light&quot;, &quot;Probe&quot;, &quot;Finger&quot;, and &quot;Sylph&quot;. In 1976 Mir Bahadur wrote in &quot;Artweek&quot; that &quot;Hand Generated Light&quot; was created by Alpert locking himself in a closet for three hours cranking a manual electrical generator keeping a tiny light aglow on the outside of the door. The article described this work, as well as &quot;Spent Time, Spent Energy&quot; and &quot;Sylph&quot; by the term &quot;Generating Art&quot;, whereby the subject of the work itself was the generation of the art being created. Another of his major works from this period of his career is &quot;Sound Sculpture&quot;.

In 1975 Alpert was interviewed as a part of a Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco (MOCA) sponsored history of art project titled &quot;11 Video Interviews&quot; produced by Jeanette Willison, and his video work was included with another MOCA video compilation titled &quot;A Tight Thirteen Minutes&quot; that same year, showing one-minute color video works from thirteen artists. During this period his work appeared in magazines including &quot;Artweek&quot; and &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;. Alpert received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant in Sculpture in 1979.

===Career in the 1980s===
Alpert&#x27;s work was described by University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Pacific Film Archive in 1980 as &quot;concerned with performance sculpture, video and concept-oriented drawing and object sculpture&quot;. That year an exhibition of his work was held at La Mamelle, &quot;Time Expands to Fit the Mold&quot;. In 1984 Alpert stated that his work was influenced not only by the performative arts but also by science. He wrote specifically that he has been inspired by Boyle&#x27;s law as well as the second law of thermodynamics.

On April 4, 1986, at 3:30pm EST Alpert&#x27;s collection of work up until that point was largely lost in an explosion that killed nine people and injured sixteen. During the explosion at the building that housed Alpert&#x27;s studio, he was working on a new sculpture when the fire began raging on the floors below him. Alpert survived the blaze that took over 150 firefighters to contain. Alpert described the fire to a journalist that day: &quot;There was no warning. There was a gigantic explosion. It went from daylight to pitch black. I got out because the roof collapsed around me.&quot;

===Career in the 2000s===
I think that all of my work ties into sculptural ideas whether video, performances, and obviously creating objects. All the art that I produce, or have produced, I feel can be interpreted as sculpture, even the work that might be seen as painting.

Since then Alpert has showed his work with a series of videos based on images recorded from a high-speed train journey in Spain, &quot;AVE (Alta Velocidad España)&quot; variations #1-10. Individual videos from this series have been screened in Europe, Cuba and India.

Alpert has also published three other books based on his photographs and videos over past ten years. He also restored a 1967 16mm film made whilst a student at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Alpert continues to produce object sculpture, photography and graphic (drawings) artwork.

He featured in &quot;Light on the Walls of Life: A Tribute Anthology to Lawrence Ferlinghetti&quot;, published by Jambu Press, San Francisco, March 24, 2022. The image of his sculpture &quot;Open the Bomb Bay Doors, Hal&quot;, appears on page 43.

== Published works ==

&quot;Warm Water Cove&quot; is a photo-book by Richard Alpert he published in 2015. His website describes this collection as &quot;… a celebration of another San Francisco; one far off the beaten path and excluded from travel brochures and TripAdvisor. This side of San Francisco was certainly not host to the &#x27;summer of love&#x27; nor &#x27;little cable cars…&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="212782" wikidata="Q1964668" url="?curid=212782" title="Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland">
<text>Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland PC (c. 1610 – 20 September 1643) was an English author and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1642. He fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War and was killed in action at the First Battle of Newbury.

==Early life==
Cary was born at Burford in either 1609 or 1610 as the son of Sir Henry Cary, afterwards first Viscount Falkland, and his wife Elizabeth, whose father Sir Lawrence Tanfield was at that time Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Henry Cary, a member of an ancient Devon family, was lord deputy of Ireland from 1622 to 1629. He was made Viscount Falkland and Lord Cary in 1620. His viscountcy, Falkland, was a royal burgh in Scotland, notwithstanding that the Carys were an English family and had no connection with the burgh, though letters patent were later issued naturalising the Viscount and his successors as Scottish subjects.

In 1621 Lucius was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge but in the following year he migrated to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1625. In 1625 he inherited from his grandfather the manors of Great Tew and Burford in Oxfordshire, and, about the age of 21, married Lettice, daughter of Sir Richard Moryson, of Tooley Park in Leicestershire. Following a quarrel with his father, whom he failed to propitiate by offering to hand over to him his estate, he left England to take service in the Dutch army, but soon returned. In 1633, by the death of his father, he became Viscount Falkland. His mother had embraced Roman Catholicism, to which it was now sought to attract Falkland himself, but his studies and reflections led him, under the influence of William Chillingworth, to the interpretation of religious problems rather by reason than by tradition or authority.

In 1634, he sold Burford Priory to William Lenthall.

==Great Tew circle==

At Great Tew he enjoyed a short but happy period of study, and he assembled a cultured circle, whom the near neighbourhood of the university and his own brilliant qualities attracted to his house. He was the friend of John Hales and Chillingworth, was celebrated by Ben Jonson, John Suckling, Abraham Cowley and Edmund Waller in verse, and in prose by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who calls him the &quot;incomparable&quot; Falkland, and draws a delightful picture of his society and hospitality.

==Political and military career==
Falkland&#x27;s intellectual pleasures, however, were soon interrupted by war and politics. He felt it his duty to take part on the side of King Charles I as a volunteer under the Earl of Essex in the Bishops&#x27; Wars of 1639 against the Scots. In 1640 he was elected Member of Parliament for Newport in the Isle of Wight to the Short Parliament. He was re-elected for Newport for the Long Parliament in November 1640, and took an active part on the side of the opposition. He spoke against the exaction of ship money on 7 December 1640, denouncing the servile conduct of Lord Keeper Finch and the judges.
He supported the prosecution of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, at the same time trying more than once to moderate the measures of the House of Commons in the interests of justice, and voted for the third reading of the attainder on 21 April 1641. On the question of the church he urged, in the debate of 8 February 1641, that the interference of the clergy in secular matters, the encroachments in jurisdiction of the spiritual courts, and the imposition by authority of unnecessary ceremonies, should be prohibited. On the other hand, though he denied that episcopacy existed &quot;jure divino&quot;, he was opposed to its abolition; fearing the establishment of the Presbyterian system, which in Scotland had proved equally tyrannical. Triennial parliaments would be sufficient to control the bishops, if they meditated any further attacks upon the national liberties, and he urged that &quot;where it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not to change&quot;. (This was probably said in reply to John Hampden during the Root and Branch Bill debate that happened later.) Even John Hampden still believed that a compromise with the episcopal principle was possible, and assured Falkland that if the bill taken up to the House of Lords on 1 May 1641, excluding the bishops from the Lords and the clergy from secular offices, were passed, &quot;there would be nothing more attempted to the prejudice of the church&quot;. Accordingly, the bill was supported by Falkland.
The times, however, were not favourable to compromise. The bill was lost in the Lords, and on 27 May the Root and Branch Bill, for the total abolition of episcopacy, was introduced in the House of Commons. This measure Falkland opposed, as well as the second bill for excluding the bishops, introduced on 21 October 1641. In the discussion on the Grand Remonstrance he took the part of the bishops and the Arminians. He was now opposed to the whole policy of the opposition, and, being reproached by John Hampden with his change of attitude, replied &quot;that he had formerly been persuaded by that worthy gentleman to believe many things which he had since found to be untrue, and therefore he had changed his opinion in many particulars as well as to things as to persons&quot;.

On 1 January 1642, immediately before the attempted arrest of the five members, of which, however, Falkland was unaware, the King offered him the secretaryship of state, and Sir Edward Hyde (later Lord Clarendon) persuaded him to accept it. Falkland thus became involved directly in the king&#x27;s policy, though evidently possessing little influence in his counsels. He was one of the peers who signed the protestation against making war, at York on 15 June 1642. On 5 September 1642 he carried Charles&#x27;s overtures for peace to the parliament, when he informed the leaders of the opposition that the king consented to a thorough reformation of religion. The secret correspondence connected with the Waller plot passed through his hands.

Falkland fought for the king at the Battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642) and at the Siege of Gloucester. By this time the hopelessness of the situation had completely overwhelmed him. The aims and principles of neither party in the conflict could satisfy a man of Falkland&#x27;s high ideals and intellectual vision. His royalism could not suffer the substitution, as the controlling power in the state, of a parliament for the monarchy, nor his conservatism the revolutionary changes in church and state now insisted upon by the opposite faction. The fatal character and policy of the king, the most incapable of men and yet the man upon whom all depended, must have been by now thoroughly understood by Falkland. Compromise had long been out of the question. The victory of either side could only bring misery; and the prolongation of the war was a prospect equally unhappy.

Falkland&#x27;s ideals and hopes were now destroyed, and he had no definite political convictions such as inspired and strengthened Strafford and John Pym. In fact his sensitive nature shrank from contact with the practical politics of the day and prevented his rise to the place of a leader or a statesman. Lord Clarendon has recorded his final relapse into despair:
Sitting amongst his friends, often, after a deep silence and frequent sighs (he) would with a shrill and sad accent ingeminate the word &quot;Peace, Peace,&quot; and would passionately profess that the very agony of the war, and the view of the calamities and desolation the kingdom did and must endure, took his sleep from him and would shortly break his heart.

At Gloucester he had in vain exposed himself to risks. On the morning of the First Battle of Newbury, on 20 September 1643, he declared to his friends, who would have dissuaded him from taking part in the fight, that &quot;he was weary of the times and foresaw much misery to his own Country and did believe he should be out of it ere night.&quot; He served during the engagement as a volunteer under Sir John Byron and, riding alone at a gap in a hedge commanded by the enemy&#x27;s fire, was immediately killed.

His body was stripped and left until recognised by a servant, who took his body back to Great Tew, where he was buried in an unmarked grave in the village churchyard.

==Death and legacy==
He died at the age of 33 and was succeeded in the title by his eldest son Lucius, 3rd Viscount Falkland. His male descent became extinct in the person of Anthony, 5th viscount in 1694, when the viscounty passed to Lucius Henry (1687–1730), a descendant of the first viscount via another line. 

A statue of Falkland sculpted by John Bell in 1845 stands in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall in the Houses of Parliament. In 1909 a suffragette called Margery Humes chained herself to the statue while protesting for women&#x27;s right to vote. The authorities were unable to remove her without chipping off much of the spur on the statue&#x27;s right boot. As it was never repaired, this lasting damage is considered a symbol of the suffragettes&#x27; struggle.

==Works==
Falkland wrote a &quot;Discourse of Infallibility&quot;, published in 1646 (Thomason Tracts, E 361), reprinted in 1650, in 1651 (E 634) edited by Triplet with replies, and in 1660 with the addition of two discourses on episcopacy by Falkland. This is a work of some importance in theological controversy, the general argument being that &quot;to those who follow their reason in the interpretation of the Scriptures God will either give his grace for assistance to find the truth or his pardon if they miss it. And then this supposed necessity of an infallible guide (with the supposed damnation for the want of it) fall together to the ground.&quot; Also &quot;A Letter ... 30 Sept. 1642 concerning the late conflict before Worcester&quot; (1642); and &quot;Poems&quot;, in which he shows himself a follower of Ben Jonson, edited by A. B. Grosart in &quot;Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library&quot;, vol. iii. (f 871).

John Aubrey attributed to Falkland the title &quot;the first Socinian in England&quot; but later gave that title to John Hales.

Also attributed to Falkland is the dictum, &quot;When it is not necessary to make a decision, it is necessary not to make a decision.&quot;

==Assessment==
According to Clarendon, he was:

In no degree attractive or promising. His stature was low and smaller than most men; his motion not graceful ... but that little person and small stature was quickly found to contain a great heart ... all mankind could not but admire and love him.

<doc id="212785" wikidata="Q349749" url="?curid=212785" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">
<text>Immanuel Velikovsky (; ; 17 November 1979) was a Russian-American psychoanalyst, writer, and catastrophist. He is the author of several books offering pseudohistorical interpretations of ancient history, including the U.S. bestseller &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; published in 1950. Velikovsky&#x27;s work is frequently cited as a canonical example of pseudoscience and has been used as an example of the demarcation problem.

His books use comparative mythology and ancient literary sources (including the Old Testament) to argue that Earth suffered catastrophic close contacts with other planets (principally Venus and Mars) in ancient history. In positioning Velikovsky among catastrophists including Hans Bellamy, Ignatius Donnelly, and , the British astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier noted &quot;... Velikovsky is not so much the first of the new catastrophists ...; he is the last in a line of traditional catastrophists going back to mediaeval times and probably earlier.&quot; Velikovsky argued that electromagnetic effects play an important role in celestial mechanics. He also proposed a revised chronology for ancient Egypt, Greece, Israel, and other cultures of the ancient Near East. The revised chronology aimed at explaining the so-called &quot;dark age&quot; of the eastern Mediterranean (–750 BC) and reconciling biblical accounts with mainstream archaeology and Egyptian chronology.

In general, Velikovsky&#x27;s theories have been ignored or vigorously rejected by the academic community. Nonetheless, his books often sold well and gained enthusiastic support in lay circles, often fuelled by claims of unfair treatment of Velikovsky by orthodox academia. The controversy surrounding his work and its reception is often referred to as &quot;the Velikovsky affair&quot;.

==Childhood and early education==
Immanuel Velikovsky was born in 1895 to a prosperous Jewish family in Vitebsk, Russian Empire (now in Belarus). The son of Shimon (Simon Yehiel) Velikovsky (1859–1937) and Beila Grodensky, he learned several languages as a child and was sent away to study at the Medvednikov Gymnasium in Moscow, where he performed well in Russian language and mathematics. He graduated with a gold medal in 1913. Velikovsky then traveled in Europe and visited Palestine before briefly studying medicine at Montpellier in France and taking premedical courses at the University of Edinburgh. He returned to Russia before the outbreak of World War I, enrolled in the University of Moscow, and received a medical degree in 1921.

==Editorial work and marriage==
Upon taking his medical degree, Velikovsky left Russia for Berlin. With the financial support of his father, Velikovsky edited and published two volumes of scientific papers translated into Hebrew. The volumes were titled &quot;Scripta Universitatis Atque Bibliothecae Hierosolymitanarum&quot; (&quot;Writings of the Jerusalem University &amp; Library&quot;). He enlisted Albert Einstein to prepare the volume dealing with mathematics and physics.

In 1923, Velikovsky married Elisheva Kramer, a young violinist.

==Career as a psychiatrist==
Velikovsky lived in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine from 1924 to 1939, practising medicine in the fields of general practice, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis which he had studied under Sigmund Freud&#x27;s pupil Wilhelm Stekel in Vienna. During this time, he had about a dozen papers published in medical and psychoanalytic journals. He was also published in Freud&#x27;s &quot;Imago&quot;, including a precocious analysis of Freud&#x27;s own dreams.

==Emigration to the US and a career as an author==
In 1939, with the prospect of war looming, Velikovsky travelled with his family to New York City, intending to spend a sabbatical year researching for his book &quot;Oedipus and Akhenaton.&quot; The book was inspired by Freud&#x27;s &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot; and explored the possibility that Pharaoh Akhenaton was the legendary Oedipus. Freud had argued that Akhenaton, the supposedly monotheistic Egyptian pharaoh, was the source of the religious principles that Moses taught to the people of Israel in the desert. Freud&#x27;s claim (and that of others before him) was based in part on the resemblance of Psalm 104 in the Bible to the Great Hymn to the Aten, an Egyptian hymn discovered on the wall of the tomb of Akhenaten&#x27;s courtier, Ay, in Akhenaten&#x27;s city of Akhetaten. To disprove Freud&#x27;s claim and to prove the Exodus as such, Velikovsky sought evidence for the Exodus in Egyptian documents. One such document was the Ipuwer Papyrus, which he felt reported events similar to several of the Biblical plagues. Since conventional Egyptology dated the Ipuwer Papyrus much earlier than either the Biblical date for the Exodus (—1450 BCE) or the Exodus date accepted by many of those who accepted the conventional chronology of Egypt (), Velikovsky had to revise the conventional chronology.

Within weeks of his arrival in the United States, World War II began. Launching on a tangent from his original book project, Velikovsky began to develop the radical catastrophist cosmology and revised chronology theories for which he would become notorious. For the remainder of the Second World War, now as a permanent resident of New York City, he continued to research and write about his ideas, searching for a means to disseminate them to academia and the public. He privately published two small &quot;Scripta Academica&quot; pamphlets summarising his theories in 1945 (&quot;Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History&quot; and &quot;Cosmos Without Gravitation&quot;). He mailed copies of the latter to academic libraries and scientists, including Harvard astronomer Harlow Shapley in 1947.

In 1950, after eight publishing houses rejected the &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; manuscript, it was finally published by Macmillan, which had a large presence in the academic textbook market. Even before its appearance, the book was enveloped by furious controversy, when &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published a highly positive feature on it, as did &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, with what would today be called a creationist slant. This came to the attention of Shapley, who opposed the publication of the work, having been made familiar with Velikovsky&#x27;s claims through the pamphlet Velikovsky had given him. Shapley threatened to organise a textbook boycott of Macmillan for its publication of &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;, and within two months the book was transferred to Doubleday. It was by then a bestseller in the United States. In 1952, Doubleday published the first installment in Velikovsky&#x27;s revised chronology, &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot;, followed by the &quot;Earth in Upheaval&quot; (a geological volume) in 1955. In November 1952, Velikovsky moved from Manhattan to Princeton, New Jersey.

For most of the 1950s and early 1960s, Velikovsky was &quot;persona non grata&quot; on college and university campuses. After this period, he began to receive more requests to speak. He lectured, frequently to record crowds, at universities across North America. In 1972, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a one-hour television special featuring Velikovsky and his work, and this was followed by a thirty-minute documentary by the BBC in 1973.

During the remainder of the 1970s, Velikovsky devoted a great deal of his time and energy to rebutting his critics in academia, and he continued to tour North America and Europe to deliver lectures on his ideas. By that time, the elderly Velikovsky had diabetes and intermittent depression, which his daughter said may have been exacerbated by the academic establishment&#x27;s continuing rejection of his work. He died in 1979.

==Posthumous administration of literary estate==
For many years, Velikovsky&#x27;s estate was controlled by his two daughters, Shulamit Velikovsky Kogan (b. 1925), and Ruth Ruhama Velikovsky Sharon (b. 1926), who generally resisted the publication of any further material. (Exceptions include the biography &quot;ABA – the Glory and the Torment: The Life of Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky&quot;, issued in 1995 and greeted with rather dubious reviews; and a Hebrew translation of another &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot; volume, &quot;The Dark Age of Greece&quot;, which was published in Israel.) A volume of Velikovsky&#x27;s discussions and correspondence with Albert Einstein appeared in Hebrew in Israel, translated and edited by his daughter Shulamit Velikovsky Kogan. In the late 1990s, a large portion of Velikovsky&#x27;s unpublished book manuscripts, essays and correspondence became available at the Velikovsky Archive website. In 2005, Velikovsky&#x27;s daughter Ruth Sharon presented his entire archive to Princeton University Library.

==Ideas==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Velikovsky published his concepts in medical and psychoanalytic journals. He is best known, however, for research performed in the 1940s when living in New York City. His main ideas in this area were summarized in an affidavit of November 1942, and two privately published &quot;Scripta Academica&quot; pamphlets, &quot;Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History&quot; (1945) and &quot;Cosmos without Gravitation&quot; (1946).

Rather than have his ideas dismissed wholesale because of potential flaws in any one area, Velikovsky then chose to publish them as a series of book volumes, aimed at a lay audience, dealing separately with his proposals on ancient history, and with areas more relevant to the physical sciences. Velikovsky was a passionate Zionist, and this did steer the focus of his work, although its scope was considerably more far-reaching than this. The entire body of work could be said to stem from an attempt to solve the following problem: that to Velikovsky there appeared to be insufficient correlation in the written or archaeological records between Biblical history and what was known of the history of the area, in particular, Egypt.

Velikovsky searched for common mention of events within literary records, and in the Ipuwer Papyrus he believed he had found a contemporary Egyptian account of the Plagues of Egypt. Moreover, he interpreted both accounts as descriptions of a great natural catastrophe. Velikovsky attempted to investigate the physical cause of these events, and extrapolated backwards and forwards in history from this point, cross-comparing written and mythical records from cultures on every inhabited continent, using them to attempt synchronisms of the historical records, yielding what he believed to be further periodic natural catastrophes that can be global in scale.

He arrived at a body of radical inter-disciplinary ideas, which might be summarised as:
*Planet Earth has suffered natural catastrophes on a global scale, both before and during humankind&#x27;s recorded history.
*There is evidence for these catastrophes in the geological record (here Velikovsky was advocating Catastrophist ideas as opposed to the prevailing Uniformitarian notions) and archeological record. The extinction of many species had occurred catastrophically, not by gradual Darwinian means.
*The catastrophes that occurred within the memory of humankind are recorded in the myths, legends and written history of all ancient cultures and civilisations. Velikovsky pointed to alleged concordances in the accounts of many cultures, and proposed that they referred to the same real events. For instance, the memory of a flood is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, in the Greek legend of Deucalion, and in the Manu legend of India. Velikovsky put forward the psychoanalytic idea of &quot;Cultural Amnesia&quot; as a mechanism whereby these literal records came to be regarded as mere myths and legends.
*The causes of these natural catastrophes were close encounters between the Earth and other bodies within the Solar System — not least what are now the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, these bodies having moved upon different orbits within human memory.
*To explain the fact that these changes to the configuration of the Solar System violate several well-understood laws of physics, Velikovsky invented a role for electromagnetic forces in counteracting gravity and orbital mechanics.

Some of Velikovsky&#x27;s specific postulated catastrophes included:
*A tentative suggestion that Earth had once been a satellite of a &quot;proto-Saturn&quot; body, before its current solar orbit.
*That the Deluge (Noah&#x27;s Flood) had been caused by proto-Saturn&#x27;s entering a nova state, and ejecting much of its mass into space.
*A suggestion that the planet Mercury was involved in the Tower of Babel catastrophe.
*Jupiter had been the prime mover in the catastrophe that saw the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
*Periodic close contacts with a &quot;cometary Venus&quot; (which had been ejected from Jupiter) had caused the Exodus events () and Joshua&#x27;s subsequent &quot;sun standing still&quot; (Joshua 10:12–13) incident.
*Periodic close contacts with Mars had caused havoc in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.

As noted above, Velikovsky had conceived the broad sweep of this material by the early 1940s. However, within his lifetime, whilst he continued to research, expand and lecture upon the details of his ideas, he released only selected portions of his work to the public in book form:
*&quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; (1950) discussed the literary and mythical records of the &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Mars&quot; catastrophes
*Portions of his &quot;Revised Chronology&quot; were published as &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot; (1952), &quot;Peoples of the Sea&quot; (1977) and &quot;Rameses II and His Time&quot; (1978) (The related monograph &quot;Oedipus and Akhenaten&quot;, 1960, posited the thesis that pharaoh Akhenaten was the prototype for the Greek mythic figure Oedipus.)
*&quot;Earth in Upheaval&quot; (1955) dealt with geological evidence for global natural catastrophes.

Velikovsky&#x27;s ideas on his earlier Saturn/Mercury/Jupiter events were never published, and the available archived manuscripts are much less developed.

Of all the strands of his work, Velikovsky published least on his belief that electromagnetism plays a role in orbital mechanics. Although he appears to have retreated from the propositions in his 1946 monograph &quot;Cosmos without Gravitation&quot;, no such retreat is apparent in &quot;Stargazers and Gravediggers&quot;. &quot;Cosmos without Gravitation&quot;, which Velikovsky placed in university libraries and sent to scientists, is a probable catalyst for the hostile response of astronomers and physicists to his later claims about astronomy. However, other Velikovskian enthusiasts such as Ralph Juergens (dec.), Earl Milton (dec.), Wal Thornhill (dec.), and Donald E. Scott have claimed that stars are powered not by internal nuclear fusion, but by galactic-scale electrical discharge currents. Such ideas do not find support in the conventional literature and are rejected as pseudoscience by the scientific community.

==Revised chronology==

Velikovsky argued that the conventional chronology of the Near East and classical world, based upon Egyptian Sothic dating and the king lists of Manetho, was wholly flawed. This was the reason for the apparent absence of correlation between the Biblical account and those of neighbouring cultures, and also the cause of the enigmatic &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in Greece and elsewhere. Velikovsky shifted several chronologies and dynasties from the Egyptian Old Kingdom to Ptolemaic times by centuries (a scheme he called the &quot;Revised Chronology&quot;), placing The Exodus contemporary with the fall of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. He proposed numerous other synchronisms stretching up to the time of Alexander the Great. He argued that these eliminate phantom &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, and vindicate the biblical accounts of history and those recorded by Herodotus.

These ideas were first put forward briefly in his &quot;Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History&quot;, but &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot; was his first full-length work on the subject. This was followed by &quot;Oedipus and Akhenaton&quot;, &quot;Peoples of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Rameses II and His Time&quot;, and two further works that were unpublished at the time of his death but that are now available online at the Velikovsky Archive: &quot;The Assyrian Conquest&quot; and &quot;The Dark Ages of Greece&quot;.

Though rejected by mainstream historians, these ideas have been developed by other historians such as David Rohl and Peter James, who have also attempted their own revised chronologies.

==Reception==

===Velikovskyism===

Velikovsky inspired numerous followers during the 1960s and 1970s.
Alfred de Grazia dedicated a 1963 issue of his journal, &quot;American Behavioral Scientist&quot;, to Velikovsky, which was published in an expanded version as a book, &quot;The Velikovsky Affair – Scientism Versus Science&quot;, in 1966.
&quot;The Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, in a review of a later book by de Grazia, &quot;Cosmic Heretics&quot; (1984), suggests that de Grazia&#x27;s efforts may be responsible for Velikovsky&#x27;s continuing notability during the 1970s.

The Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS) was &quot;formed in 1974 in response to the growing interest in the works of modern catastrophists, notably the highly controversial Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky&quot;. The Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences (ISIS) is a 1985 spinoff from the SIS founded under the directorship of David Rohl, who had come to reject Velikovsky&#x27;s Revised Chronology in favour of his own &quot;New Chronology&quot;.

&quot;&quot; was founded in 1975 explicitly &quot;to deal with Velikovsky&#x27;s work&quot;. Ten issues of &quot;Pensée: Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered&quot; appeared from 1972 to 1975.
The controversy surrounding Velikovsky peaked in the mid-1970s and public interest declined in the 1980s and, by 1984, erstwhile Velikovskyist C. Leroy Ellenberger had become a vocal critic of Velikovskian catastrophism. Some Velikovskyist publications and authors such as David Talbott remain active into the 2000s.

===Criticism===
Velikovsky&#x27;s ideas have been rejected by mainstream academia (often vociferously so) and his work is generally regarded as erroneous in all its detailed conclusions. Moreover, scholars view his unorthodox methodology (for example, using comparative mythology to derive scenarios in celestial mechanics) as an unacceptable way to arrive at conclusions. Stephen Jay Gould offered a synopsis of the mainstream response to Velikovsky, writing, &quot;Velikovsky is neither crank nor charlatan—although, to state my opinion and to quote one of my colleagues, he is at least gloriously wrong ... Velikovsky would rebuild the science of celestial mechanics to save the literal accuracy of ancient legends.&quot;

Velikovsky&#x27;s bestselling, and as a consequence most criticized, book is &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;. Astronomer Harlow Shapley, along with others such as Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, were highly critical of Macmillan&#x27;s decision to publish the work. The fundamental criticism against this book from the astronomy community was that its celestial mechanics were physically impossible, requiring planetary orbits that do not conform with the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum.

Velikovsky relates in his book &quot;Stargazers &amp; Gravediggers&quot; how he tried to protect himself from criticism of his celestial mechanics by removing the original appendix on the subject from &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;, hoping that the merit of his ideas would be evaluated on the basis of his comparative mythology and use of literary sources alone. However, this strategy did not protect him: the appendix was an expanded version of the &quot;Cosmos Without Gravitation&quot; monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940s—and they had regarded the physics within it as absurd.

By 1974, the controversy surrounding Velikovsky&#x27;s work had permeated US society to the point where the American Association for the Advancement of Science felt obliged to address the situation, as they had previously done in relation to UFOs, and devoted a scientific session to Velikovsky featuring (among others) Velikovsky himself and Professor Carl Sagan. Sagan gave a critique of Velikovsky&#x27;s ideas (the book version of Sagan&#x27;s critique is much longer than that presented in the talk; see below). His criticisms are available in &quot;Scientists Confront Velikovsky&quot; and as a corrected and revised version in the book &quot;Broca&#x27;s Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science&quot;.

It was not until the 1980s that a very detailed critique of &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; was made in terms of its use of mythical and literary sources when Bob Forrest published a highly critical examination of them (see below). Earlier in 1974, James Fitton published a brief critique of Velikovsky&#x27;s interpretation of myth (ignored by Velikovsky and his defenders) whose indictment began: &quot;In at least three important ways Velikovsky&#x27;s use of mythology is unsound. The first of these is his proclivity to treat all myths as having independent value; the second is the tendency to treat only such material as is consistent with his thesis; and the third is his very unsystematic method.&quot; A short analysis of the position of arguments in the late 20th century is given by Dr Velikovsky&#x27;s ex-associate, and &quot;Kronos&quot; editor, C. Leroy Ellenberger, in his &quot;A Lesson from Velikovsky&quot;.

More recently, the absence of supporting material in ice-core studies (such as the Greenland Dye-3 and Vostok cores) has removed any basis for the proposition of a global catastrophe of the proposed dimension within the later Holocene period. However, tree-ring expert Mike Baillie would give credit to Velikovsky after disallowing the impossible aspects of &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot;: &quot;However, I would not disagree with &quot;all&quot; aspects of Velikovsky&#x27;s work. Velikovsky was almost certainly correct in his assertion that ancient texts hold clues to catastrophic events in the relatively recent past, within the span of human civilization, which involve the effects of comets, meteorites and cometary dust ... But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets ... He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects ... This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth ... In other words, we can get down to his main thesis, which is that the Earth experienced dramatic events from heavenly bodies particularly in the second millennium BC.&quot;

Velikovsky&#x27;s revised chronology has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky&#x27;s usage of material for proof is often very selective. In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky&#x27;s use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs&#x27; attack. In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot; series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that the Revised Chronology was untenable. The SIS has continued to publish updates of this ongoing discussion, in particular the work of historian Emmet Sweeney.

While James credits Velikovsky with &quot;point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology&quot;, he severely criticised the contents of Velikovsky&#x27;s chronology as &quot;disastrously extreme&quot;, producing &quot;a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve&quot; and claiming that &quot;Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy.&quot;

Bauer accuses Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting interpretations which are at best possible, and gives several examples from &quot;Ages in Chaos&quot;.

==&quot;The Velikovsky Affair&quot;==
Such was the hostility directed against Velikovsky from some quarters (particularly the original campaign led by Harlow Shapley), that some commentators have made an analysis of the conflict itself. Among these was a study by &quot;American Behavioral Scientist&quot; magazine, eventually published in book form as &quot;The Velikovsky Affair — Scientism Versus Science.&quot; This framed the discussion in terms of how academic disciplines reacted to ideas from workers from outside their field, claiming that there was an academic aversion to permitting people to cross inter-disciplinary boundaries. More recently, James Gilbert, professor of history at the University of Maryland, challenged this traditional version with an account that focused on the intellectual rivalry between Velikovsky&#x27;s ally Horace Kallen and Harlow Shapley. Earlier, Henry Bauer had challenged the view that the Velikovsky Affair illustrated the resistance of scientists to new ideas by pointing out &quot;the nature and validity of Velikovsky&#x27;s claims must be considered before one decides that the Affair can illuminate the reception of new ideas in science ...&quot; and, on the same basis, Keith Dixon contended that the treatment of the case by sociologists was an example of a broader unhealthy tendency in sociology to explain all opinions as ideologically motivated without considering their possible rational basis.

The scientific press, in general, denied Velikovsky a forum to rebut his critics. Velikovsky claimed that this made him a &quot;suppressed genius&quot;, and he likened himself to the 16th century heretical friar Giordano Bruno, who was burnt at the stake for his beliefs.

The controversy created by Velikovsky&#x27;s publications may have helped revive the catastrophist movement in the second half of the 20th century; however, some working in the field also hold that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair.

<doc id="212786" wikidata="Q170002" url="?curid=212786" title="Maltose">
<text>Maltose ( or ), also known as maltobiose or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from two units of glucose joined with an α(1→4) bond. In the isomer isomaltose, the two glucose molecules are joined with an α(1→6) bond. Maltose is the two-unit member of the amylose homologous series, the key structural motif of starch. When beta-amylase breaks down starch, it removes two glucose units at a time, producing maltose. An example of this reaction is found in germinating seeds, which is why it was named after malt. Unlike sucrose, it is a reducing sugar.

== History ==
Maltose was discovered by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut, although this discovery was not widely accepted until it was confirmed in 1872 by Irish chemist and brewer Cornelius O&#x27;Sullivan. Its name comes from malt, combined with the suffix &#x27;-ose&#x27; which is used in names of sugars.

== Structure and nomenclature ==
Carbohydrates are generally divided into monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of sugar subunits. Maltose, with two sugar units, is a disaccharide, which falls under oligosaccharides. Glucose is a hexose: a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms. The two glucose units are in the pyranose form and are joined by an O-glycosidic bond, with the first carbon (C1) of the first glucose linked to the fourth carbon (C4) of the second glucose, indicated as (1→4). The link is characterized as α because the glycosidic bond to the anomeric carbon (C1) is in the opposite plane from the substituent in the same ring (C6 of the first glucose). If the glycosidic bond to the anomeric carbon (C1) were in the same plane as the substituent, it would be classified as a β(1→4) bond, and the resulting molecule would be cellobiose. The anomeric carbon (C1) of the second glucose molecule, which is not involved in a glycosidic bond, could be either an α- or β-anomer depending on the bond direction of the attached hydroxyl group relative to the substituent of the same ring, resulting in either α-maltose or β-maltose.

An isomer of maltose is isomaltose. This is similar to maltose but instead of a bond in the α(1→4) position, it is in the α(1→6) position, the same bond that is found at the branch points of glycogen and amylopectin.

== Properties ==
Like glucose, maltose is a reducing sugar, because the ring of one of the two glucose units can open to present a free aldehyde group; the other one cannot because of the nature of the glycosidic bond. Maltose can be broken down to glucose by the maltase enzyme, which catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond.

Maltose in aqueous solution exhibits mutarotation, because the α and β isomers that are formed by the different conformations of the anomeric carbon have different specific rotations, and in aqueous solutions, these two forms are in equilibrium. Maltose can easily be detected by the Woehlk test or Fearon&#x27;s test on methylamine.

It has a sweet taste, but is only about 30–60% as sweet as sugar, depending on the concentration. A 10% solution of maltose is 35% as sweet as sucrose.

== Sources and absorption ==

Maltose is a malt component, a substance obtained when the grain is softened in water and germinates. It is also present in highly variable quantities in partially hydrolyzed starch products like maltodextrin, corn syrup and acid-thinned starch.

Outside of plants, maltose is also (likely) found in sugarbag.

In humans, maltose is broken down by various maltase enzymes, providing two glucose molecules that can be further processed: either broken down to provide energy, or stored as glycogen. The lack of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme in humans causes sucrose intolerance, but complete maltose intolerance is extremely rare because there are four different maltase enzymes.

<doc id="212796" wikidata="Q10809118" url="?curid=212796" title="Mannose">
<text>Mannose is a sugar with the formula , which sometimes is abbreviated Man. It is one of the monomers of the aldohexose series of carbohydrates. It is a C-2 epimer of glucose. Mannose is important in human metabolism, especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins. Several congenital disorders of glycosylation are associated with mutations in enzymes involved in mannose metabolism.

Mannose is not an essential nutrient; it can be produced in the human body from glucose, or converted into glucose. Mannose provides 2–5 kcal/g. It is partially excreted in the urine.

==Etymology==
The root of both &quot;mannose&quot; and &quot;mannitol&quot; is manna, which the Bible describes as the food supplied to the Israelites during their journey in the region of Sinai. Several trees and shrubs can produce a substance called manna, such as the &quot;manna tree&quot; (&quot;Fraxinus ornus&quot;) from whose secretions mannitol was originally isolated.

==Structure==
Mannose commonly exists as two different-sized rings, the pyranose (six-membered) form and the furanose (five-membered) form. Each ring closure can have either an alpha or beta configuration at the anomeric position. The chemical rapidly undergoes isomerization among these four forms.

==Metabolism==

While much of the mannose used in glycosylation is believed to be derived from glucose, in cultured hepatoma cells (cancerous cells from the liver), most of the mannose for glycoprotein biosynthesis comes from extracellular mannose, not glucose. Many of the glycoproteins produced in the liver are secreted into the bloodstream, so dietary mannose is distributed throughout the body.

Mannose is present in numerous glycoconjugates including &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation of proteins. &quot;C&quot;-Mannosylation is also abundant and can be found in collagen-like regions.

The digestion of many polysaccharides and glycoproteins yields mannose, which is phosphorylated by hexokinase to generate mannose-6-phosphate. Mannose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate, by the enzyme phosphomannose isomerase, and then enters the glycolytic pathway or is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the gluconeogenic pathway of hepatocytes.

Mannose is a dominant monosaccharide in &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation, which is a post-translational modification of proteins. It is initiated by the &quot;en bloc&quot; transfer on Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to nascent glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a co-translational manner as the protein entered through the transport system. Glucose is hydrolyzed on fully folded protein and the mannose moieties are hydrolyzed by ER and Golgi-resident mannosidases. Typically, mature human glycoproteins only contain three mannose residues buried under sequential modification by GlcNAc, galactose, and sialic acid. This is important, as the innate immune system in mammals is geared to recognise exposed mannose residues. This activity is due to the prevalence of mannose residues, in the form of mannans, on the surfaces of yeasts. The human immunodeficiency virus displays considerable amount of mannose residues due to the tight clustering of glycans in its viral spike. These mannose residues are the target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.

==Biotechnology==
Recombinant proteins produced in yeast may be subject to mannose addition in patterns different from those used by mammalian cells. This difference in recombinant proteins from those normally produced in mammalian organisms may influence the effectiveness of vaccines.

==Formation==
Mannose can be formed by the oxidation of mannitol.

It can also be formed from glucose in the Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation.

==Uses==
Mannose (-mannose) is used as a dietary supplement to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). , one review found that taking mannose was as effective as antibiotics to prevent UTIs, while another review found that clinical trial quality was too low to allow any conclusion about using ‐mannose to prevent or treat UTIs. In 2024, a randomized clinical trial among 598 women with recurrent UTI recruited from primary care settings found the proportion experiencing a medically attended UTI was 51.0% in those taking daily -mannose over 6 months and 55.7% in those taking placebo, concluding that -mannose should not be recommended to prevent future episodes of medically attended UTI in women with recurrent UTI in primary care.

==Configuration==
Mannose differs from glucose by inversion of the C-2 chiral center. Mannose displays a formula_1 pucker in the solution ring form. This simple change leads to the drastically different biochemistry of the two hexoses. This change has the same effect on the other aldohexoses, as well.

==Mannose PTS permease==

The PEP-dependent sugar transporting phosphotransferase system transports and simultaneously phosphorylates its sugar substrates. Mannose XYZ permease is a member of the family, with this distinct method being used by bacteria for sugar uptake particularly exogenous hexoses in the case of mannose XYZ to release the phosphate esters into the cell cytoplasm in preparation for metabolism primarily through the route of glycolysis. The MANXYZ transporter complex is also involved in infection of &quot;E. coli&quot; by bacteriophage lambda, with subunit ManY and ManZ being sufficient for proper lambda phage infection.
MANXYZ possesses four domains in three polypeptide chains; ManX, ManY, and ManZ. The ManX subunit forms a homodimer that is localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. ManX contains two domains IIA and IIB linked by a hinge peptide with each domain containing a phosphorylation site and phosphoryl transfer occurs between both subunits. ManX can be membrane bound or not. The ManY and ManNZ subunits are hydrophobic integral membrane proteins with six and one transmembrane alpha helical spanner(s). The phosphoryl group of PEP is transferred to the imported sugar via Enzyme 1, histidine protein phosphate carrier, and then to the ManX, ManY, and ManZ subunits of the ManXYZ transportation complex, which phosphorylates the entering hexose sugar, creating a hexose-6-phosphate.

<text>Saint-Domingue () was a French colony in the western portion of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, in the area of modern-day Haiti, from 1697 to 1804. The name derives from the Spanish main city on the island, Santo Domingo, which came to refer specifically to the Spanish-held Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, now the Dominican Republic. The borders between the two were fluid and changed over time until they were finally solidified in the Dominican War of Independence in 1844.

The French had established themselves on the western portion of the islands of Hispaniola and Tortuga by 1659. In the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, Spain formally recognized French control of Tortuga Island and the western third of the island of Hispaniola. In 1791, slaves and some Creoles took part in a Vodou ceremony at Bois Caïman and planned the Haitian Revolution. The slave rebellion later allied with Republican French forces following the abolition of slavery in the colony in 1793, although this alienated the island&#x27;s dominant slave-owning class. France controlled the entirety of Hispaniola from 1795 to 1802, when a renewed rebellion began. The last French troops withdrew from the western portion of the island in late 1803, and the colony later declared its independence as Haiti, the Taino name for the island, the following year.

==Overview==
Spain controlled the entire island of Hispaniola from the 1490s until the 17th century, when French pirates began establishing bases on the western side of the island. The official name was &quot;La Española&quot;, meaning &quot;The Spanish (Island)&quot;. It was also called &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;, after Saint Dominic.

The western part of Hispaniola was neglected by the Spanish authorities, and French buccaneers began to settle first on the island of Tortuga, then on the northwest of Hispaniola. Spain later ceded the entire western coast of the island to France, retaining the rest of the island, including the &quot;Guava Valley&quot;, today known as the &quot;Central Plateau&quot;.

The French called their portion of Hispaniola &quot;Saint-Domingue&quot;, the French equivalent of &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;. The Spanish colony on Hispaniola remained separate, and eventually became the Dominican Republic, the capital of which is still named Santo Domingo.

==History==

===The division of Hispaniola===
When Christopher Columbus took possession of the island in 1492, he named it &quot;Insula Hispana&quot;, meaning &quot;the Spanish island&quot; in Latin. As Spain conquered new regions on the mainland of the Americas (Spanish Main), its interest in Hispaniola waned, and the colony&#x27;s population grew slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors, notably Tortuga, had become regular stopping points for Caribbean pirates. In 1606, the king of Spain ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than securing the island, however, this resulted in French, English and Dutch pirates establishing bases on the now-abandoned north and west coasts of the island.

French buccaneers established a settlement on the island of Tortuga in 1625 before going to Grande Terre (the mainland). At first they survived by pirating ships, eating wild cattle and hogs, and selling hides to traders of all nations. Although the Spanish destroyed the buccaneers&#x27; settlements several times, on each occasion they returned, drawn by the abundance of natural resources: hardwood trees, wild hogs and cattle, and fresh water. The settlement on Tortuga was officially established in 1659 under the commission of King Louis XIV.

In 1665, French colonization of the islands of Hispaniola and Tortuga entailed slavery-based plantation agricultural activity such as growing coffee and cattle farming. It was officially recognized by King Louis XIV. Spain tacitly recognized the French presence in the western third of the island in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick; the Spanish deliberately omitted direct reference to the island from the treaty, but they were never able to reclaim this territory from the French.

The economy of Saint-Domingue became focused on slave-based agricultural plantations. Saint-Domingue&#x27;s Black population quickly increased. They followed the example of neighboring Caribbean colonies in coercive treatment of the slaves. More cattle and slave agricultural holdings, coffee plantations and spice plantations were implemented, as well as fishing, cultivation of cocoa, coconuts, and snuff. Saint-Domingue quickly came to overshadow the previous colony in both wealth and population. Nicknamed the &quot;Pearl of the Antilles,&quot; Saint-Domingue became the richest and most prosperous French colony in the West Indies, cementing its status as an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe. Thus, the income and the taxes from slave-based sugar production became a major source of the French budget.

Among the first buccaneers was Bertrand d&#x27;Ogeron (1613–1676), who played a big part in the settlement of Saint-Domingue. He encouraged the planting of tobacco, which turned a population of buccaneers and freebooters, who had not acquiesced to royal authority until 1660, into a sedentary population. D&#x27;Ogeron also attracted many colonists from Martinique and Guadeloupe, including Jean Roy, Jean Hebert and his family, and Guillaume Barre and his family, who were driven out by the land pressure which was generated by the extension of the sugar plantations in those colonies. But in 1670, shortly after Cap-Français (later &quot;Cap-Haïtien&quot;) had been established, the crisis of tobacco intervened and a great number of places were abandoned. The rows of freebooting grew bigger; plundering raids, like those of Vera Cruz in 1683 or of Campêche in 1686, became increasingly numerous, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquis de Seignelay, elder son of Jean Baptist Colbert and at the time Minister of the Navy, brought back some order by taking a great number of measures, including the creation of plantations of indigo and of cane sugar. The first sugar windmill was built in 1685.

On 22 July 1795, Spain ceded to France the remaining Spanish part of the island of Hispaniola, Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic),
in the second Treaty of Basel, ending the War of the Pyrenees. The people of the eastern part of Saint-Domingue (French Santo Domingo) were opposed to the arrangements and hostile toward the French. The islanders revolted against their new masters and a state of anarchy ensued, leading to more French troops being brought in.

Until the mid-18th century, there were efforts made by the French Crown to found a stable French-European population in the colony, a difficult task because there were few European women there. From the 17th century to the mid-18th century, the Crown attempted to remedy this by sending women from France to Saint-Domingue and Martinique to marry the settlers. However, these women were rumoured to be former prostitutes from La Salpêtrière and the settlers complained about the system in 1713, stating that the women sent were not suitable, a complaint that was repeated in 1743. The system was consequently abandoned, and with it the plans for colonisation. In the later half of the 18th century, it became common and accepted that a Frenchman during his stay of a few years would cohabitate with a local black female.

An early death among Europeans was very common due to diseases and conflicts; the French soldiers that Napoleon sent in 1802 to quell the revolt in Saint-Domingue were attacked by yellow fever during the Haitian Revolution, and more than half of the French army died of disease.

===Saint-Domingue colony===
====Plantation economy====

Prior to the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the economy of Saint-Domingue gradually expanded, with sugar and, later, coffee becoming important export crops. After the war, which disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In 1767, it exported 72 million pounds of raw sugar and 51 million pounds of refined sugar, one million pounds of indigo, and two million pounds of cotton. Saint-Domingue became known as the &quot;Pearl of the Antilles&quot; – one of the richest colonies in the world in the 18th-century French empire. It was the greatest jewel in imperial France&#x27;s mercantile crown. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced about 40 percent of all the sugar and 60 percent of all the coffee consumed in Europe. By 1789, Saint Domingue was made up of about 8,000 plantations ..., producing one-half of all the sugar and coffee that was consumed in Europe and the Americas. This single colony, roughly the size of Hawaii or Belgium, produced more sugar and coffee than all of the British West Indies colonies combined, generating enormous revenue for the French government and enhancing its power.

Between 1681 and 1791 the labor for these plantations was provided by an estimated 790,000 or 860,000 slaves, accounting in 1783–1791 for a third of the entire Atlantic slave trade. In addition, some Native Americans were enslaved in Louisiana and sent to Saint-Domingue, particularly in the wake of the Natchez revolt. Between 1764 and 1771, the average annual importation of African slaves varied between 10,000 and 15,000; by 1786 it was about 28,000, and from 1787 onward, the colony received more than 30,000 slaves a year.

The inability to maintain slave numbers without constant resupply from Africa meant that at all times, a majority of slaves in the colony were African-born, as specific conditions of slavery and exposure to tropical diseases such as yellow fever prevented the population from experiencing growth through natural increase. Slave traders ventured along the Atlantic coast of Africa, buying slaves for plantation labor; most of the slaves they bought were war-captives and enslaved by an opposing African ethnic group. The slaves that they purchased came from hundreds of different tribes; their languages often were mutually incomprehensible, and they learned Creole French to communicate.

The slave population around 1789 totaled to 406,000 (according to Jacques Pierre Brissot) or 465,000, while there were 28,000 to 32,000 &quot;affranchis&quot; (ex-slaves) and Creole of color population who numbered about 28,000 or 32,000. Whites totaled to be around 40,000 to 45,000 whites which included its largest group being the &quot;Petits blancs&quot; (white commoners; lit: &quot;little whites&quot;) and Creoles of lighter complexions; French subjects: &quot;engagés&quot; (white indentured servants), foreign European immigrants or refugees, and a small exclusive group of &quot;Grands blancs&quot; (white nobles; lit: &quot;big whites&quot;) of whom the majority lived or were born in France.

There were numerous kinds of plantations in Saint-Domingue. Some planters produced indigo, cotton, and coffee; these plantations were small in scale, and usually only had 15–30 slaves, creating an intimate work environment. However, the most valuable plantations produced sugar. The average sugar plantation employed 300 slaves, and the largest sugar plantation on record employed 1400 slaves. These plantations took up only 14% of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s cultivated land; comparatively, coffee was 50% of all cultivated land, indigo was 22%, and cotton only 5%. Because of the comparative investment requirement between sugar plantations and all other plantation types, there was a big economic gap between normal planters and sugar &quot;lords.&quot;

While &quot;grands blancs&quot; owned 800 large scale sugar plantations, the &quot;petits blancs&quot; and &quot;gens de couleur&quot; (people of color) owned 11,700 small scale plantations, of which &quot;petits blancs&quot; owned 5,700 plantations, counting 3,000 indigo, 2,000 coffee, and 700 cotton; the &quot;affranchis&quot; and Creoles of color owned 6,000 plantations that mainly produced coffee of which they held an economic monopoly.

===Saint-Domingue Creole society===

Saint-Domingue had the largest and wealthiest free population of color in the Caribbean; they were known as the &quot;Gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color). Population estimations in 1789 indicate 28,000 to 32,000 &quot;affranchis&quot; and Creoles of color and 40,000 to 45,000 whites, which included its largest group being the &quot;Petits blancs&quot; (white commoners; lit: &quot;little whites&quot;) and Creoles of lighter complexions; French subjects: &quot;engagés&quot; (white indentured servants), foreign European immigrants or refugees, and a small exclusive group of &quot;Grands blancs&quot; (white nobles; lit: &quot;big whites&quot;) of whom the majority lived or were born in France, and the slave population totalled between 406,000 and 465,000. While many of the &quot;Gens de couleur libres&quot; were &quot;affranchis&quot; (ex-slaves), most members of this class were Creoles of color, i.e. free born blacks and mulattoes. As in New Orleans, a system of &quot;plaçage&quot; developed, in which white men had a kind of common-law marriage with slave or free mistresses, and provided for them with a dowry, sometimes freedom, and often education or apprenticeships for their children. Some such descendants of planters inherited considerable property.

While the French controlled Saint-Domingue, they maintained a class system which covered both whites and free people of color. These classes divided up roles on the island and established a hierarchy. The highest class, known as the &quot;grands blancs&quot; (white noblemen), was composed of rich nobles, including royalty, and mainly lived in France. These individuals held most of the power and controlled much of the property on Saint-Domingue. Although their group was very small and exclusive, they were quite powerful.

Below the &quot;grands blancs&quot; were the &quot;petits blancs&quot; (white commoners) and the &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color). These classes inhabited Saint Domingue and held a lot of local political power and control of the militia. &quot;Petits blancs&quot; shared the same societal level as &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;.
The &quot;Gens de couleur libres&quot; class was made up of &quot;affranchis&quot; (ex-slaves), free-born blacks, and mixed-race people, and they controlled much wealth and land in the same way as &quot;petits blancs&quot;; they held full citizenship and civil equality with other French subjects. Race was initially tied to culture and class, and some &quot;white&quot; Creoles had non-white ancestry.

Although the Creoles of color and &quot;affranchis&quot; held considerable power, they eventually became the subject of racism and a system of segregation due to the introduction of divisionist policies by the royal government, as the Bourbon regime feared the united power of the Creoles.

Starting in the early 1760s, and gaining much impetus after 1769, Bourbon royalist authorities began attempts to cut Creoles of color out of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s society, banning them from working in positions of public trust or as respected professionals. They were made subject to discriminatory colonial legislation. Statutes forbade &quot;Gens de couleur&quot; from taking up certain professions, wearing European clothing, carrying swords or firearms in public, or attending social functions where whites were present.

The regulations did not restrict their purchase of land, and many had already accumulated substantial holdings and became slave-owners. By 1789, they owned one-third of the plantation property and one-quarter of the slaves of Saint-Domingue. Central to the rise of the &quot;Gens de couleur&quot; planter class was the growing importance of coffee, which thrived on the marginal hillside plots to which they were often relegated. The largest concentration of &quot;Gens de couleur&quot; was in the southern peninsula. This was the last region of the colony to be settled, owing to its distance from Atlantic shipping lanes and its formidable terrain, with the highest mountain range in the Caribbean. In the parish of Jérémie, the &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; formed the majority of the population. Many lived in Port-au-Prince as well, which became an economic center in the South of the island.

====Africans in Saint-Domingue====
The vast majority of the slaves in Saint-Domingue were war-captives who had lost a war with another ethnic group. Most slaves came from ethnic tension between different tribes and kingdoms, or religious wars between pagans and Muslim-pagan interreligious wars. Many of the slaves who came to Saint-Domingue could not return to Africa, as their home was controlled by an opposing African ethnic group, and they stayed as &quot;affranchis&quot; in Saint-Domingue.



African folklore, such as the widespread tales of Compère Lapin and Compère Bouqui, has been recorded throughout Haiti.
Charles Malenfant, a French Captain of Dragoons who arrived in St. Domingue in 1792, after fighting had begun, compiled a list of who he thought were the different African peoples found in that French colony. Thus, the following list, taken from his 1814 &quot;Memoir&quot;, should be read as representative of European bias and second-hand knowledge:


*The Bambaras. &quot;Bambara&quot; was often used as a generic term for African slaves. European traders used &quot;Bambara&quot; as a term for defining vaguely a region of ethnic origin. Muslim traders and interpreters often used &quot;Bambara&quot; to indicate Non-Muslim captives. Slave traders would sometimes identify their slaves as &quot;Bambara&quot; in hopes of securing a higher price, as Bambara slaves were sometimes characterized as being more passive. Further confusing the name&#x27;s indication of ethnic, linguistic, religious, or other implications, the concurrent Bambara Empire had notoriety for its practice of slave-capturing wherein Bambara soldiers would raid neighbors and capture the young men of other ethnic groups, forcibly assimilate them, and turn them into slave soldiers known as &quot;Ton&quot;. The Bambara Empire depended on war-captives to replenish and increase its numbers; many of the people who called themselves &quot;Bambara&quot; were indeed not ethnic Bambara.
* The Dunkos, a tattooed people whose women cherished their men with the utmost respect.
* The Aradas, a tattooed people who used poison to kill their enemies. They worshipped the moon, mollusks, and serpents. Toussaint Louverture was reportedly of Arada heritage.
* The people of Juida, a tattooed people whose women were known to be extroardinarily flirtatious. The women of Juida wore a heavy ring inside of their bottom lip, and the skin of their throat was modified with cuts of a knife.
* The people of Essa who religiously worshipped the dead king of their people as a divinity. They place his body in a pagoda following the main route of their capital on a richly ornamented throne, and worship him until the reigning King of Essa dies. The cadavre is embalmed with palm oil which conserves the body&#x27;s freshness for a long time. The body is dressed very extravagantly, and a guardian watches it day and night as travelers come to visit and pay respects.
* The people of Urba, a fierce people who are arbitrary in their resolutions of revenge. If a murder takes place, the dead&#x27;s relatives do not search for the killer; rather, they will hide and will disembowel the first passer-by without fear of a judiciary backlash, offering the victim&#x27;s life as a sacrifice to their god Brataoth. They prepare the funeral of their relative, leaving the corpse of their victim exposed to the air, and devoured by ferocious beasts. They dig a huge trench where the murder was committed, so that the spirit of the dead may not wander to other places. The cadaver is embalmed and exposed and placed in an iron cage, so that the body is not touching the ground. For this reason the body is safe from carnivorous animals as they cannot get through the iron bars and the deepness of the trench. A little hut is constructed above the cage so that the weather does not interfere with the body.

:The King of Urba often calls meetings of magic men that are called Makendals, whose purpose is to foresee the results of battles, and in the event of a defeat, to indicate which soldiers were responsible for the failure of the battle; the Makendals many times would arbitrarily call upon innocent men to face punishment for &quot;criminal conduct&quot; leading to the defeat. When the King of Urba loses many of his people to war, he assembles the Makendal council, and consults the members on the way to repopulate his kingdom, where he is recommended to buy 1. one hundred gourde vases, 2. one hundred jugs, 3. one hundred slaves. The Makendals transport all of these on the major roadway, and order the slaves&#x27; bodies to be opened, where they pour red palm oil inside and specific shells, and bury all of these items at a specific location. This is the ritual of repopulation to gain favor from their gods.
:The Aminas who believed in metempsychosis, or the migration of the soul after death. When slaves from this ethnic group would arrive in Saint-Domingue, some would use suicide to return to the country of whence they came, believing that they would regain the rank, wealth, relatives, and friends that they lost after they were defeated in war.
:For an example, an account of this metempsychosis occurred on the plantation of Mr.Desdunes, who had purchased an Amina woman and her two children. The woman and children had barely arrived on the island, and the woman was witnessed observing the Ester river, stopping every moment to measure the depth of the river, and making sighs while lifting her eyes to the sky.
:One morning, the Amina woman was found drowned with her two children attached on her belt. The children&#x27;s screams for help, echoing the horrors of their soon-to-be death, were heard by African fishermen, but not knowing to what to attribute the cause, they didn&#x27;t go to the location to render aid.

*The Igbos who also believed in metempsychosis.
* The people of Borno had women who took very great care in selecting a suitable partner. The Borno women were absolutely submissive to their men, and sought to be bodily clean at all times. They would bathe three times a day and use palm oil to anoint their bodies.

:In finding a partner, old women of Borno are chosen to examine the new wife, and they bring her to her nuptial bed playing instruments and singing chants of joy, if she is indeed found to be a virgin.

:If, however, she is found not to be a virgin, she will be declared a prostitute. Prostitution in Borno was punished by enslavement; Borno prostitutes would be taken by order of the king, shipped to a coastal slave port to be sold to the first European slave ship that arrived.

:During child birth, other Borno wise-women serve as nurses to provide aid to the soon-to-be mother. As the child is born and the umbilical cord is cut, the scissors used are placed carefully under the pillow of the baby. The scissors are not used again except for the purpose of cutting the umbilical cord.

:New-born babies of Borno are tattooed eight days after their birth with the characteristics of their nation, which are placed on the face, the chest, on the arm, and elsewhere on the body. The designs are of a symmetrical sun, tongues of fire, diverse animals, of reptiles, and of prevalent architecture in their society.

:The people of Borno do not eat meat unless it is sacrificed and blessed by their grand-priest, called an &quot;alpha&quot;. Pork is entirely banned from their diet.

:A pilgrim to Borno will follow the main road with jugs filled with water, of which he offers to passer-byes or weary travelers.

:Their common money is shells, and they have a great veneration for a prayer book that, if they touch it cannot leave before reading it, singing by memory. The people of Borno would rather sell all of their animals rather than diminish their piety for their sacred laws.

:The Borno people have a code of laws for the punishment of crimes, following which require three witnesses to prosecute. Their good faith is so strong that if they are inclined to believe the witnesses, the accused will immediately be hung.

:Every house in Borno is like small island surrounding a courtyard. At night, the whole family assembles in the home to avoid savage beasts like leopards &amp; lions.

:The King of Borno never leaves his palace, and if someone who enters into the palace dares to fix his eyes on him, he will be punished by death. While the king must make judgements in criminal proceedings, he is seated on a throne and hidden from the vision of the general population by a elegantly fashioned curtain. Any declaration he makes is echoed through the chamber by 7 pipes. The subject to whom the declaration is made indicates his submission to the judgement of the king by giving him his humble recognition, and he kneels, claps with his hands, and covers his head with ashes.

:Thievery is abhorred in the society of Borno. If one is found guilty of thievery, the crime is not thought to be individual; indeed the whole family is charged with the crime. For example, if child of Borno takes something that doesn&#x27;t belong to him, the courtiers of the king take the child and his whole family and sell them as slaves.

:If a member of the royal court is found of adultery, he is punished with death. The woman will be drowned and the father and child are impaled and placed on the road to serve as an example.

:The people of Borno can hunt once a year. They burn the grass in swamps to fetch the nests of aquatic fowl and take their eggs, and the turtles that hide in the area. As the people don&#x27;t eat any meat except smoked, these provisions last for the whole year.

====Slavery in Saint-Domingue====
Planters took care to treat slaves well in the beginning of their time on the plantation, and they slowly integrated slaves into the plantation&#x27;s labor system. On each plantation there was a black commander who supervised the other slaves on behalf of the planter, and the planter made sure not to favor one African ethnic group over others. 

Most slaves who came to Saint-Domingue worked in fields or shops; younger slaves could become household servants, and old slaves were employed as surveillants. Some slaves became skilled workmen, and they received privileges such as better food, the ability to go into town, and &quot;liberté des savanes&quot; (savannah liberty), a sort of freedom with certain rules. Slaves were considered to be valuable property, and slaves were attended by doctors who gave medical care when they were sick.

Here is a description of how the &quot;liberté des savanes&quot; (savannah liberty) Creole custom worked:
To regularize slavery, in 1685 Louis XIV had enacted the &quot;Code Noir&quot;, which accorded certain rights to slaves and responsibilities to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe and provide for the general well-being of his slaves.

The &quot;Code Noir&quot; also conferred &quot;affranchis&quot; (ex-slaves) full citizenship and gave complete civil equality with other French subjects. Saint Domingue&#x27;s &quot;Code Noir&quot; never outlawed interracial marriage, nor did it limit the amount of property a free person could give to &quot;affranchis&quot;. Creoles of color and &quot;affranchis&quot; used the colonial courts to protect their property and sue whites in the colony.

The &quot;Code Noir&quot; sanctioned corporal punishment but had provisions intended to regulate the administration of punishments.

=====Sugar plantations=====

Some sugar planters, bent on earning high sugar yields, worked their slaves very hard. Costs to start a sugar cane plantation were very high, compared to every other plantation type, often causing the proprietor of the sugar plantation to go into deep debt. Despite a rural police, due to Saint-Domingue&#x27;s rough terrain and isolation away from French administration, the &quot;Code Noir&#x27;s&quot; protections were sometimes ignored on remote sugar plantations. Justin Girod-Chantrans, a famous contemporary French traveler and naturalist of the time noted one such sugar plantation:

Work in the fields was often difficult, and life expectancy was low. Some owners deep in debt concluded that it was more economically profitable to work their slaves to death and import replacements than to provide their slaves with adequate food, clothing and medical care. Some 5–10 percent of slaves died every year, from disease and overworking, and even more when epidemics of disease swept through the colony. In fact, deaths were outpacing births. The population of the colony only remained constant due to the constant influx of enslaved people. A majority of slaves only lived for a few years after their arrival.
 Many people in the colony were outraged by the death of many slaves and the brutality occurring. They proposed reforms that would help the population growth including allowing pregnant women and mothers more time off. 

A large portion of the enslaved work force worked in harvesting and processing sugar. The conditions made harvesting much more difficult. Slaves were met with &#x27;razor-sharp&#x27; stalks; insects and snakes were also hiding within the fields. Work days during harvest typically lasted from 5 am to sunset. Stronger slaves would do difficult field work, while children and older slaves would do easier tasks, such as trimming canes. It is worth noting, however, that the processing of cane sugar was mostly completed by women. The processing of sugar in sugar mills was also dangerous, and it was not uncommon for slaves to lose arms.

African culture remained strong among slaves to the end of French rule. The folk religion of Vodou commingled Catholic liturgy and ritual with the beliefs and practices of the Vodun religion of Guinea, Congo and Dahomey. Creoles were hesitant to consider Vodou an authentic religion, perceiving it instead as superstition, and they promulgated laws against Vodou practices, effectively forcing it underground.
Their connection with the Vodou religion aided in healing the trauma of plantation life, as they created their own rituals and healing processes. This outlet allowed the slaves in Saint-Domingue to escape the society that saw them as property and not human.

====Marronnage====

Thousands of slaves escaped into the mountains of Saint-Domingue, forming communities of maroons and raiding isolated plantations. The most famous was Mackandal, a one-armed slave, originally from the Guinea region of Africa, who escaped in 1751. A Vodou Houngan (priest), he united many of the different maroon bands. For the next six years, he staged successful raids while evading capture by the French. He and his followers reputedly killed more than 6,000 people. He preached a radical vision of killing the white population of Saint-Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the planters, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Français.

Slaves who fled to remote mountainous areas were called &quot;marron&quot; (French) or &quot;mawon&quot; (Haitian Creole), meaning &#x27;escaped slave&#x27;. The maroons formed close-knit communities that practised small-scale agriculture and hunting. They were known to return to plantations to free family members and friends. On a few occasions, they also joined the Taíno settlements, who had escaped the Spanish in the 17th century. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, there were a large number of maroons living in the Bahoruco mountains. In 1702, a French expedition against them killed three maroons and captured 11, but over 30 evaded capture, and retreated further into the mountainous forests. Further expeditions were carried out against them with limited success, though they did succeed in capturing one of their leaders, Michel, in 1719. In subsequent expeditions, in 1728 and 1733, French forces captured 46 and 32 maroons respectively. No matter how many detachments were sent against these maroons, they continued to attract runaways. Expeditions in 1740, 1742, 1746, 1757 and 1761 had minor successes against these maroons, but failed to destroy their hideaways.

In 1776–77, a joint French-Spanish expedition ventured into the border regions of the Bahoruco mountains, with the intention of destroying the maroon settlements there. However, the maroons had been alerted of their coming, and had abandoned their villages and caves, retreating further into the mountainous forests where they could not be found. The detachment eventually returned, unsuccessful, and having lost many soldiers to illness and desertion. In the years that followed, the maroons attacked a number of settlements, including Fond-Parisien, for food, weapons, gunpowder and women. It was on one of these excursions that one of the maroon leaders, Kebinda, who had been born in freedom in the mountains, was captured. He later died in captivity.

In 1782, de Saint-Larry decided to offer peace terms to one of the maroon leaders, Santiago, granted them freedom in return for which they would hunt all further runaways and return them to their owners. Eventually, at the end of 1785, terms were agreed, and the more than 100 maroons under Santiago&#x27;s command stopped making incursions into French colonial territory.

====White indentured servitude and economic downturn====

As the social systems of Saint-Domingue began to erode after the 1760s, the plantation economy of Saint-Domingue also began to weaken. The price of slaves doubled between 1750 and 1780 and land in Saint-Domingue tripled in price during the same period. Sugar prices still increased, but at a much lower rate than before. The profitability of other crops like coffee collapsed in 1770, causing many planters to go into debt. The planters of Saint-Domingue were eclipsed in their profits by enterprising businessmen; they no longer had a guarantee on their plantation investment, and the slave-trading economy came under increased scrutiny.

Along with the establishment of a French abolitionist movement, the Société des amis des Noirs, French economists demonstrated that paid labor or indentured servitude were much more cost-effective than slave labor. In principle the widespread implementation of indentured servitude on plantations could have produced the same output as slave labor. However, the Bourbon King Louis XVI did not want to change the labor system in his colonies, as slave labor was directly responsible for allowing France to surpass Britain in trade.

Slaves, however, became expensive, each one costing around 300 Spanish dollars. To counteract expensive slave labor, white indentured servants were imported. White indentured servants usually worked for five to seven years and their masters provided them housing, food, and clothing. Saint-Domingue gradually increased its reliance on indentured servants (known as &quot;petits blanchets&quot; or &quot;engagés&quot;) and by 1789 about 6 percent of all white Creoles were employed as labor on plantations along with slaves.

Many of the indentured servants in Saint-Domingue were German settlers or Acadian refugees deported by the British from old Acadia during the French and Indian War. Hundreds of Acadian refugees perished while forceably building a jungle military base for the French government of Saint-Domingue.

Despite signs of economic decline, Saint-Domingue continued to produce more sugar than all of the British Caribbean islands combined.

===End of colonial rule===
====The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue====

In France, the majority of the Estates General, an advisory body to the King, reconstituted itself as the Republican National Assembly, made radical changes in French laws, and on 26 August 1789, published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, declaring all men free and equal. The French Revolution shaped the course of the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed on the island.

Wealthy Creole planters saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France. The elite planters intended to take control of the island and create favorable trade regulations to further their own wealth and power and to restore social &amp; political equality granted to the Creoles.
Creole aristocrats like Vincent Ogé, Jean-Baptiste Chavannes, and the ex-governor of Saint-Domingue Guillaume de Bellecombe, incited several revolts to take control of Saint-Domingue from the Royal government. These revolts included the incitation of a slave revolt that destroyed much of the northern plain of Saint-Domingue. Creole rebel forces eventually defeated the Bourbon royalists, but they soon lost control of the slave revolt as Spanish and British forces concurrently invaded the colony.

&quot;The rebellion was extremely violent ... the rich plain of the North was reduced to ruins and ashes ...&quot; Within two months, the slave revolt in northern Saint-Domingue killed 2,000 Creoles and burned 280 sugar plantations owned by &quot;grand blancs&quot;. Ash from blazing sugar cane fields fell from afar onto Cap-Français. As the rebellion in Saint-Domingue dragged on, it changed in nature from a political revolution to a racial war.
After months of arson and murder, Toussaint Louverture, a planter and Jacobin from Saint-Domingue, and his general Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a field slave, took charge of the leaderless slave revolt; they formed an alliance with Spanish invasion forces. Louverture and Dessalines were inspired by the &quot;houngans&quot; (sorcerers or priests of Haitian Vodou) Dutty Boukman and François Mackandal.

As 7,000 French Republican forces arrived on the island in September 1792, they began fighting against the Creole rebels, Bourbon Royalists, as well as British and Spanish forces. In an attempt to take control of the slave revolt and entice Creole rebels to join them, French Republicans declared amnesty for any revolting slaves and Creole rebels if they would fight for the Republic.

To gain amnesty, Louverture betrayed the Spanish forces, eradicated them, and joined the Republican revolutionary army.

=====Commissioner Sonthonax=====

Léger-Félicité Sonthonax from September 1792 to 1795 was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Saint-Domingue. He was a French Girondist and abolitionist 
during the French Revolution, and closely associated with the &quot;Société des amis des Noirs&quot; (Friends of the Blacks Society). His official title was Civil Commissioner. Within a year of his appointment, his powers were considerably expanded by the Committee of Public Safety.

Sonthonax believed that all of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s whites were Bourbon royalist or rebel separatist conservatives attached to independence or joining Spain. He stripped away all of the military power of white Creoles, and by doing so, he alienated them from the Republican government. Meaning to radicalize slaves to the Republican cause, Sonthonax wrote:



Many &quot;gens de couleur&quot;, the &quot;affranchis&quot; (ex-slaves) and Creole residents of the colony whose rights were restored by the French National Convention as part of the decree of 15 May 1792, asserted that they could form the military backbone of Republican Saint-Domingue; Sonthonax rejected this view as outdated in the wake of the August 1791 slave uprising. He believed that Saint-Domingue would need slave soldiers among the ranks of the colonial army if it was to survive. Sonthonax abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue with an emancipation proclamation; some of his critics allege that he ended slavery to maintain his own power.

Louverture worked together with Sonthonax for a few years, but he ultimately forced Sonthonax out of his position in 1795, and became the sole ruler of northern Saint-Domingue.

====Civil War and invasion of Santo Domingo (1798–1801)====
In 1799, Louverture started a civil war known as the War of Knives with Creole general André Rigaud who ruled an autonomous state in the south; Louverture claimed that Rigaud attempted to assassinate him. Louverture delegated most of the campaign to his lieutenant, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who became infamous, during and after the civil war, for murdering about 10,000 Creole captives and civilians. After defeating Rigaud, Louverture became master of the whole French colony of Saint-Domingue.
In November 1799, during the civil war in Saint-Domingue, Napoleon Bonaparte gained power in France. He created a new civil code; the French Civil Code of Napoleon affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men; it established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention.

Napoleon also passed a new constitution, declaring that the colonies would be subject to special laws. Although slaves in Saint-Domingue suspected this meant the re-introduction of slavery, Napoleon began by confirming Louverture&#x27;s position and promising to maintain the abolition.

Napoleon forbade Louverture to control the formerly Spanish settlement on the eastern side of Hispaniola, as that would have given the Louverture a more powerful defensive position. In January 1801, Louverture invaded the Spanish territory of Santo Domingo, taking possession of it from the governor, Don Garcia, with few difficulties. The area was less developed and populated than the French section. Louverture brought it under French law, abolishing slavery and embarking on a program of modernization. He now controlled the entire island.

Louverture promulgated the Constitution of 1801 on 7 July, officially establishing his authority as governor general &quot;for life&quot; over the entire island of Hispaniola and confirming most of his existing policies. Article 3 of the constitution states: &quot;There cannot exist slaves [in Saint-Domingue], servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.&quot;

During this time, Bonaparte met with the planters of Saint-Domingue and they urged the restoration of slavery in Saint-Domingue, stating that it was integral to the colony&#x27;s economy.

=====Toussaint Louverture&#x27;s prevention of economic collapse in Saint-Domingue=====
Louverture as Saint-Domingue&#x27;s Governor-General-for-life enacted forced plantation labor to prevent the collapse of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s economy. This may have contributed to a rebellion against his regime of forced labor led by his nephew and top general, Moïse, in October 1801. Louverture violently suppressed the labor rebellion, with the result that when the French ships arrived, not all of Saint-Domingue was automatically on Louverture&#x27;s side.

A minority of state officials and civil servants were exempt from manual labor, including Creoles of color. Many of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s poor had to work hard to survive, and they became increasingly motivated by their hunger. Consisting mostly of slaves, the population was uneducated and largely unskilled. They lived under Louverture&#x27;s authoritarian control as forced rural laborers. Whites felt the sting of labor most sharply. While Louverture, an &quot;affranchi&quot; who had a tolerant master and became a slave holder and plantation owner himself, felt magnanimity toward whites, Dessalines, a former field slave, despised them.

Many of Saint-Domingue&#x27;s whites fled the island during the civil war. Toussaint Louverture, however, understood that they formed a vital part of the economy in Saint-Dommingue as a middle class, and in the hopes of slowing the impending economic collapse, he invited them to return. He gave property settlements and indemnities for war time losses, and promised equal treatment in his new Saint-Domingue; a good number of white Creole refugees did return. The refugees who came back to Saint-Domingue and believed in Toussaint Louverture&#x27;s rule were later exterminated by Jean-Jacques Dessalines.

====The Haitian Revolution====
Napoleon dispatched troops in 1802 under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Emmanuel Leclerc, to restore French rule to the island. Creole leaders who were defeated during the War of Knives such as André Rigaud and Alexandre Pétion accompanied Leclerc&#x27;s French expeditionary forces.
Napoleon wanted to take control of Saint-Domingue again through diplomatic means. In late January 1802, Leclerc arrived and asked permission to land at Cap-Français, but Henri Christophe prevented him. At the same time, the Vicomte de Rochambeau suddenly attacked Fort-Liberté, effectively quashing the diplomatic option and starting a new war in Saint-Domingue.

Both Louverture and Dessalines fought against the French expeditionary forces, but after the Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot, Dessalines defected from his long-time ally Louverture and joined Leclerc&#x27;s forces. Leclerc proclaimed peaceful intentions, but kept secret his orders to deport black officers holding a rank above captain.

Eventually, a ceasefire was enacted between Louverture and the French expeditionary forces. During this ceasefire, Louverture was captured &amp; arrested. Jean-Jacques Dessalines was at least partially responsible for Louverture&#x27;s arrest, as asserted by several authors, including Louverture&#x27;s son, Isaac. On 22 May 1802, after Dessalines learned that Louverture had failed to instruct a local rebel leader to lay down his arms per the recent ceasefire agreement, he immediately wrote to Leclerc to denounce Louverture&#x27;s conduct as &quot;extraordinary&quot;.

Leclerc originally asked Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. Jean Baptiste Brunet was ordered to do so, and he deported Louverture and his aides to France, claiming that he suspected the former leader of plotting an uprising. Louverture warned, &quot;In overthrowing me you have cut down in Saint-Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty; it will spring up again from the roots, for they are numerous and they are deep.&quot;

For a few months, the island was quiet under Napoleonic rule. But when it became apparent that the French intended to re-establish slavery, because they had done so on Guadeloupe, Dessalines and Pétion switched sides again, in October 1802, and fought against the French. In November Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army; the Vicomte de Rochambeau then became the commanding officer of French expeditionary forces.

The Vicomte de Rochambeau fought a brutal campaign. His atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the Haitian rebel cause. A passage from the personal secretary of the later King of Northern Haiti (1811–1820), Henry I describes punishments some slaves received:

Eventually, the British allied with the Haitian revolutionaries and enacted a naval blockade on the French forces. Dessalines led the Haitian revolution until its completion, when the French forces were finally defeated in 1803. The last battle of the Haitian Revolution, the Battle of Vertières, occurred on 18 November 1803, near Cap-Haïtien. When the French withdrew, they had only 7,000 troops left to ship to France.

In 1804, all remaining whites in Saint-Domingue were slaughtered and massacred wholesale under the orders of Dessalines. Ex-slaves or Creoles who declared to be traitors to Dessalines&#x27; rule were also eradicated.

====Genocide of the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue====
Between February and April 1804, Governor-General-for-life Jean-Jacques Dessalines ordered the genocide of all remaining whites in Haitian territory. He decreed that all those suspected of conspiring in the acts of the expeditionary army should be put to death, including Creoles of color and freed slaves deemed traitors to Dessalines&#x27; regime. Dessalines gave the order to the cities of Haiti that all white people should also be put to death. The weapons used should be silent weapons such as knives and bayonets rather than gunfire, so that the killing could be done more quietly, and avoid warning intended victims by the sound of gunfire and thereby giving them the opportunity to escape.
From early January 1804 until 22 April 1804, squads of soldiers moved from house to house throughout Haiti, torturing and killing entire families. Eyewitness accounts of the massacre describe imprisonment and killings even of whites who had been friendly and sympathetic to the Haitian Revolution.

The course of the massacre showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited. Before his arrival, there were only a few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area&#x27;s white population should be put into effect. Reportedly, he ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that the blame should not be placed solely on the black population. Mass killings took place on the streets and in places outside the cities.

In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred. Women and children were generally killed last. White women were &quot;often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death.&quot;

Dessalines did not specifically mention that the white women should be killed, and the soldiers were reportedly somewhat hesitant to do so. In the end, however, the women were also put to death, though normally at a later stage of the massacre than the adult males. The argument for killing the women was that whites would not truly be eradicated if the white women were spared to give birth to new Frenchmen.

Before his departure from a city, Dessalines would proclaim an amnesty for all the whites who had survived in hiding during the massacre. When these people left their hiding place, however, they were murdered as well. Some whites were, nevertheless, hidden and smuggled out to sea by foreigners. There were notable exceptions to the ordered killings. A contingent of Polish defectors were given amnesty and granted Haitian citizenship for their renouncement of French allegiance and support of Haitian independence. Dessalines referred to the Poles as &quot;the White Negroes of Europe&quot;, as an expression of his solidarity and gratitude.

====Empire of Haiti (1804–1806)====
Dessalines was crowned Emperor Jacques I of the Haitian Empire on 6 October 1804 in the city of Cap-Haïtien. On 20 May 1805, his government released the Imperial Constitution, naming Jean-Jacques Dessalines emperor for life with the right to name his successor. Dessalines declared Haiti to be an all-black nation and forbade whites from ever owning property or land there. The generals who served under Dessalines during the Haitian Revolution became the new planter class of Haiti.

In order to slow the economic collapse of Haiti, Dessalines enforced a harsh regimen of plantation labor on newly freed slaves. Dessalines demanded that all blacks work either as soldiers to defend the nation or return to the plantations as labourers, so as to raise commodity crops such as sugar and coffee for export to sustain his new empire. His forces were strict in enforcing this, to the extent that some black subjects felt they were enslaved again. Haitian society became feudal in nature as workers could not leave the land they worked.

Dessalines was assassinated on 17 October 1806 by rebels led by Haitian generals Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion; his body was found dismembered and mutilated. Dessalines&#x27; murder did not solve the tensions in Haiti; instead, the country was torn into two new countries led by each general. The Northern State of Haiti (later the Kingdom of Haiti) maintained forced plantation labor and became rich, while the Southern Republic of Haiti abandoned forced plantation labor and collapsed economically.

==Aftermath==
The Haitian Revolution culminated in the elimination of slavery in Saint-Domingue and the founding of the Haitian Empire in the whole of Hispaniola. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon lost interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere.

Between 1791 and 1810, more than 25,000 Creoles – planters, poorer whites (&quot;&quot;petits blancs&quot;), and free people of color (&quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;&quot;), as well as the slaves who accompanied them – fled primarily to the United States in 1793, Jamaica in 1798, and Cuba in 1803. Many of them found their way to Louisiana, with the largest wave of refugees, more than 10,000 people – almost equally divided among whites, free people of color, and slaves – arriving in New Orleans between May 1809 and January 1810 after being expelled from Cuba, nearly doubling the population of the city. These refugees had a significant impact on the culture of Louisiana, including developing its sugar industry and cultural institutions.

On April 17, 1825, the French king (Charles X) issued a decree stating France would recognize Haitian independence, but only at the price of 150 million francs – 10 times the amount the U.S. had paid for the Louisiana territory. The sum was meant to compensate the French colonists for their lost revenues from slavery. Newspaper articles from the period reveal that the French king knew the Haitian government was hardly capable of making these payments, as the total was more than 10 times Haiti&#x27;s annual budget. Baron de Mackau, whom Charles X sent to deliver the ordinance, arrived in Haiti in July, accompanied by a squadron of 14 brigs of war carrying more than 500 cannons. With the threat of violence looming, on July 11, 1825, Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer signed the document, which stated, &quot;The present inhabitants of the French part of St. Domingue shall pay … in five equal installments … the sum of 150,000,000 francs, destined to indemnify the former colonists.&quot; Researchers have found that the independence debt and the resulting drain on the Haitian treasury were directly responsible not only for the underfunding of education in 20th-century Haiti, but also lack of health care and the country&#x27;s inability to develop public infrastructure.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, American and British authors often referred to Saint-Domingue period as &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; or &quot;San Domingo.&quot;:2 This led to confusion with the earlier Spanish colony, and later the contemporary Spanish colony established at Santo Domingo during the colonial period; in particular, in political debates on slavery previous to the American Civil War, &quot;San Domingo&quot; was used to express fears of Southern whites of a slave rebellion breaking out in their own region. Today, the former Spanish possession contemporary with the early period of the French colony corresponds mostly with the Dominican Republic, whose capital is Santo Domingo. The name of Saint-Domingue was changed to Hayti (Haïti) when Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared the independence of all Hispaniola from the French in 1804. Like the name &quot;Haiti&quot; itself, &quot;Saint-Domingue&quot; may refer to all of Hispaniola, or the western part in the French colonial period, while the Spanish version &quot;Hispaniola&quot; or &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; is often used to refer to the Spanish colonial period or the Dominican nation.

<text>A tour puzzle is a puzzle in which the player travels around a board (usually but not necessarily two-dimensional) using a token which represents a character. Maze puzzles are often of this type.

Sometimes the player has more than one token with which to travel. Sometimes certain objects have to be found or retrieved on the way. In the case of large hedge mazes, the player makes the trip themselves instead of a token.

Often there is a given start and finish position for the player&#x27;s token. Some tour puzzles demand that certain points on the board have to be visited on the way.

==Examples of tour puzzles==
* knight&#x27;s tour
* mazes and labyrinths
* mizmazes
* logic mazes
* Hiroimono

<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t even think about it!&quot; is an emphatic prohibition popularized by a 1993 Pepsi commercial featuring Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, a famous basketball player.

==History==

The catchphrase as used by the Pepsi ad was based upon a similar phrase, &quot;Don&#x27;t even THINK of parking here&quot;, which came into use on no parking signs in major cities such as New York City and Chicago. The signs first appeared in New York in 1982 during Ed Koch&#x27;s mayoral administration.

==Popularization==
The 1993 commercial featuring O&#x27;Neal begins with him playing hoops at a street basketball court. A little kid notices him, and exclaims O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Shaq&quot;. O&#x27;Neal, noticing that the kid has a Pepsi in his hand, walks over and says &quot;Hey, can I have it?&quot; He bends over, supposing that his admirer will give him the soda, but the kid refuses, saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t even think about it!&quot; Suddenly, a sound simulating that of a scratched record is heard, and the commercial ends with the Pepsi logo and slogan.

The commercial is actually a parody of another famous one from the 1970s produced by Pepsi&#x27;s rival, Coca-Cola, in which a young boy meets football player &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene as he is leaving the field after a game. The boy gives his hero a bottle of Coke and, in exchange for the drink, the football player throws his jersey to the boy, who excitedly catches the souvenir.

In a Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life episode, Rocko got a traffic ticket for literally thinking of parking.

The sign is mentioned in an episode of &quot;Arthur&quot; in the backdoor pilot for &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;.

<text>Richard Bartlett Schroder (born April 13, 1970) is an American actor and filmmaker. As a child actor billed as Ricky Schroder he debuted in the film &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), for which he became the youngest Golden Globe award recipient, and went on to become a child star on the sitcom &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; (1982–87). He has continued acting as an adult, usually billed as Rick Schroder, notably in the Western miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989) and on the police drama series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1998–2001). He made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Black Cloud&quot; (2004) and has produced several films and television series, including the anthology film &quot;Locker 13&quot; and the war documentary &quot;The Fighting Season.&quot;

==Early life==
Schroder was born in Brooklyn, New York City and raised on Staten Island, the son of Diane Katherine Bartlett and Richard John Schroder, both former employees of AT&amp;T. His paternal grandparents were German immigrants. Schroder&#x27;s mother quit her job to raise him and his sister Dawn. As a child, Schroder appeared in many catalogs, and by age six, he had appeared in 60 advertisements.

==Career==
=== As a child actor ===
Schroder made his film debut as the son of Jon Voight&#x27;s character in &quot;The Champ&quot;, a 1979 remake of the 1931 film of the same title. He was nominated for, and subsequently won, a Golden Globe award in 1980 for Best New Male Star of the Year in a Motion Picture, becoming at age nine the youngest Golden Globe winner in history. Following his role in &quot;The Champ&quot;, Schroder was removed from school by his parents in the third grade to focus on his career. He moved to Los Angeles with his mother, but his father remained in New York City and kept his job with AT&amp;T. The following year, Schroder appeared in the Disney feature film &quot;The Last Flight of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, with Elliott Gould. He also starred as the title character in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, alongside Sir Alec Guinness.

Schroder then became well known as the star of the television series &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;. He played a starring role as Ricky Stratton, the son of a wealthy and eccentric millionaire, Edward Stratton. His performance earned him two Young Artist Awards. He struggled with his identity as an actor when &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; ended. Prospective roles were rare, and he was mainly designated to play boyish-looking teenagers or blond-haired heartthrobs. Schroder avoided the vices of other child actors and attempted to establish himself as a more mature actor, dropping the &quot;y&quot; from his first name. His mother enrolled him in Calabasas High School, but Schroder had trouble adjusting to the new environment.

In 1988, a year after &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; ended, Schroder starred in a prime time CBS TV movie based on a true story, the drama &quot;Too Young the Hero&quot;, as 12-year-old Calvin Graham who passes for 17 to enlist in World War II. He also appeared as the guest timekeeper in &quot;Wrestlemania 2&quot; for a match between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy.

===Later career===
After graduating from high school, Schroder enrolled in Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado. His co-starring role in the Western miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot;, helped him to be recognized in more mature roles. His roles as Danny Sorenson on three seasons of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, nurse Paul Flowers in &quot;Scrubs&quot;, Dr. Dylan West on &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, and Mike Doyle on the 2007 season of &quot;24&quot; worked to cement that perception with the viewing audience. In the fall of 2002 he hosted &quot;The New American Sportsman&quot; on ESPN2, a remake of the 1965–1986 outdoor TV series &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;.

Schroder made his directorial debut in 2004 with the feature film &quot;Black Cloud&quot;, a drama also written by him about a Navajo boxer. &quot;Black Cloud&quot; received positive receptions at film festivals, including two awards at the Phoenix Film Festival and Best Director award for Schroder at the San Diego Film Festival. He also directed and starred in the music video for &quot;Whiskey Lullaby&quot;, a song by Brad Paisley and Alison Krauss. The video garnered Schroder an award for Best Music Video at the 2005 Nashville Film Festival, while at the 2005 CMT Music Awards, the video won an award for Collaborative Video of the Year, and Schroder won for Director of the Year.

In 2009, he directed the adventure horror film &quot;Hellhounds&quot;. He guest-starred in a January 2011 episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot;.

With his production company, Ricky Schroder Productions, he produced &quot;Starting Strong&quot;, a series of recruiting commercials for the U.S. Army shot as reality series in 2013. His production company has well as other documentaries &quot;The Fighting Season&quot;, &quot;My Fighting Season&quot;, and &quot;The Volunteers&quot;. Schroder spent 110 days in Afghanistan with the US military in 2014 to capture footage. In 2013 he directed, produced, and starred in the TV film &quot;Our Wild Hearts&quot; for the Hallmark Channel, and the following year co-produced and starred in the anthology film &quot;Locker 13.&quot; He portrayed the father of Dolly Parton in the 2015 TV film &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Coat of Many Colors&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love.&quot;

==Personal life==
Schroder married Andrea Bernard on September 26, 1992. They have four children: Holden, Luke, Cambrie, and Faith. They all appeared in Schroder&#x27;s &quot;Our Wild Hearts&quot; (2013)&quot;.&quot; In 2000, Schroder joined his wife&#x27;s church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is not very vocal about his religious beliefs, and said in a 2015 interview: &quot;I don&#x27;t consider myself an extremely religious person, but at the same time I do believe there is higher power.&quot; He and his wife separated in 2016, and she filed for divorce later in the year.

He is an avid hunter and fisherman, having learned to shoot at the age of 10 from actor William Holden on the set of &quot;The Earthling&quot;. For 16 years he owned a 15,000-acre ranch near Grand Junction, Colorado, adjacent to Grand Mesa National Forest.

A 2004 news article called Schroder &quot;one of the few out-of-the-closet conservatives&quot; in the entertainment industry. Schroder has long identified as a Republican, and he spoke at the 2000 Republican National Convention, although he said in 2010 that he did not align with either major political party.

In 2019, Schroder was arrested twice within a month for suspicion of domestic violence; no charges were filed.

In November 2020, Schroder contributed $150,000 towards the $2million bail fund for Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year old charged and later acquitted in the shooting deaths of two people during the August 2020 unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

In May 2021, Schroder created controversy when he uploaded a video to social media that showed him harassing a Costco employee regarding the company&#x27;s policy and California mandate requiring face masks or coverings to be worn inside stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after the incident, Schroder began receiving backlash, causing him to upload a second video apologizing to the employee, stating that while he stood by his beliefs on the mask mandate, he was sorry if he hurt the employee&#x27;s feelings.

<doc id="212809" wikidata="Q5141066" url="?curid=212809" title="Cog (advertisement)">
<text>&quot;Cog&quot; is a British television and cinema advertisement launched by Honda in 2003 to promote the seventh-generation Accord line of cars. It follows the convention of a Rube Goldberg machine, utilizing a chain of colliding parts taken from a disassembled Accord. Wieden+Kennedy developed a £6 million marketing campaign around &quot;Cog&quot; and its partner pieces, &quot;Sense&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;, broadcast later in the year. The piece itself was produced on a budget of £1 million by Partizan Midi-Minuit. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet directed the seven-month production, contracting The Mill to handle post-production. The 120-second final cut of &quot;Cog&quot; was broadcast on British television on 6 April 2003, during a commercial break in ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix.

The campaign was very successful both critically and financially. Honda&#x27;s UK domain saw more web traffic in the 24 hours after &quot;Cog&quot; television début than all but one UK automotive brand received during that entire month. The branded content attached to &quot;Cog&quot; through interactive television was accessed by more than 250,000 people, and 10,000 people followed up with a request for a brochure for the Honda Accord or a DVD copy of the advertisement. 

The high cost of 120-second slots in televised commercial breaks meant that the full version of &quot;Cog&quot; was broadcast only a handful of times, and only in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden. Despite its limited run, it is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking and influential commercials of the 2000s, and received more awards from the television and advertising industries than any commercial in history. However, it has also faced persistent accusations of plagiarism by Peter Fischli and David Weiss, the creators of &quot;The Way Things Go&quot; (1987).

==Sequence==
&quot;Cog&quot; opens with a close-up on a transmission bearing rolling down a board into a synchro hub. The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off the board and into a camshaft and pulley wheel. The camera tracks slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to ziplines made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows. Later sequences begin to make use of the Accord&#x27;s electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor, and a side door with a door-mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through.

The majority of &quot;Cog&quot; takes place in complete silence, the only sounds coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s 1979 single &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;. The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully assembled Honda Accord Wagon on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls off the trailer, and stops in front of a tonneau cover bearing the &quot;Accord&quot; marque, while narrator Garrison Keillor asks &quot;Isn&#x27;t it nice when things just work?&quot;. The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand&#x27;s motto, &quot;The Power of Dreams&quot;.

==Production==
===Background===

Honda&#x27;s share of the European automotive market had been in decline since 1998, and the company&#x27;s position as the number two Japanese automotive company, behind Toyota, had been taken by Nissan. European consumers perceived the brand as staid and uninspiring, and the cars to be of lesser quality than those produced by European manufacturers. In one survey, one quarter of respondents &quot;wouldn&#x27;t dream of buying a Honda as their next car&quot;. It was in this climate in 2001 that advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy proposed to Honda a new advertising strategy based on the company&#x27;s Japanese motto, &quot;Yume No Chikara&quot; (&quot;Power of Dreams&quot;). The stated goal of the campaign was to increase Honda&#x27;s share of the UK market to five percent within three years and to change the public image of the brand from &quot;dull but functional&quot; to &quot;warm and consumer-friendly&quot;, all on a lower marketing budget than its predecessor agency had demanded.

The first series of promotions in the United Kingdom adopted the strapline &quot;What if...?&quot;, and explored various &quot;dream-like&quot; scenarios. The first television campaign explicitly introduced the premise of the campaign by asking what would happen if the world&#x27;s favourite word (Okay) was replaced with &quot;What if?&quot;. The next few pieces of the campaign, &quot;Pecking Order&quot;, &quot;Seats&quot;, and &quot;Bus Lane&quot; for television and &quot;Doodle&quot;, &quot;Big Grin&quot;, and &quot;Oblonger&quot; for radio, became progressively more surreal, and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches. In 2002, W+K Creative Directors Tony Davidson and Kim Papworth and creative team Matt Gooden and Ben Walker, proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the seventh-generation Honda Accord line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan. The advertisement, based on a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself, was approved and given the working title &quot;Cog&quot;.

===Pre-production===
Gooden and Walker had been working together since 1988. By 2002, their portfolio included a Guinness World Record-holding one-second advertisement produced for Leo Burnett Worldwide, and a depression-awareness booklet for the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust. Wieden+Kennedy approached Honda with a rough, low-budget 30-second trial film, inspired by the children&#x27;s board game Mouse Trap, Caractacus Potts&#x27; breakfast-making machine in the film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, and a 1987 Swiss art film by Peter Fischli and David Weiss, &quot;Der Lauf der Dinge&quot; (&quot;The Way Things Go&quot;).

The Honda executives were intrigued, but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving permission to go ahead with the full-scale project. &quot;Cog&quot; was approved with a budget of £1 million, and Gooden &amp; Walker recruited a London-based team to go through the logistics of the shoot in detail. The team, which comprised engineers, special effects technicians, car designers and even a sculptor, spent a month working with parts from a disassembled Honda Accord before the design for the advertisement&#x27;s set was even finalised. Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet was hired to direct the piece. Bardou-Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award-winning music videos, including Alex Gopher&#x27;s &quot;The Child&quot;, Playgroup&#x27;s &quot;Number One&quot;, and Air&#x27;s &quot;How Does It Make You Feel&quot;.

===Filming===
Bardou-Jacquet wanted to compose the advertisement with as little computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside for the creation of hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.

The final cut of &quot;Cog&quot; consists of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together later in post-production. (The stitching appears during the moment when the exhaust [muffler] rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of . Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, it took approximately 100 takes to film the commercial. (Rumors about 606 takes were later debunked.) The team commandeered two of Honda&#x27;s six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer at the end of the advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.

===Post-production===
&quot;Cog&quot; needed only limited post-production work, as the decision had been made early on to eschew computer-generated imagery wherever possible. To further reduce the work required, &quot;Barnsley&quot;, a specialist in the Flame editing tool (real name, Andrew Wood), from The Mill, spent a lot of time on set during filming, where he advised the film crew on whether particular sections could be accomplished more easily by re-filming or by manipulating the image afterwards. Even so, the constant movement of the components on-camera made it difficult to achieve a seamless transition between the two 60-second shots. Several sections also required minor video editing, such as re-centering the frame to stay closer to the action, removal of wires, highlighting a spray of water, and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes.

==Release and reception==

===Schedule===
&quot;Cog&quot; was first aired on British television on Sunday 6 April 2003. It filled an entire commercial break in ITV&#x27;s coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix. The release was widely remarked upon by the media, with articles appearing in both broadsheets such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;; and tabloid papers such as &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. The day after &quot;Cog&quot;&#x27;s debut, the Honda website received more hits than at any time in its history, and overnight became the second most-popular automotive website in the UK.

The full 120-second version of the advertisement aired only 10 times in all, and only in the 10 days after the initial screening. The slots were chosen for maximum impact, mostly in high-profile sporting events such as the UEFA Champion&#x27;s League football match between Manchester United and Real Madrid. The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60-second and five 30-second variations, which continued to air for a further six weeks. These shortened versions made use of newly introduced interactive options on the Sky Digital television network. Viewers were encouraged to press a button on their remote control, bringing up a menu that allowed the viewer to see the full 120-second version of the advertisement. Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord. The DVD, which was also included as an insert in 1.2 million newspapers in the first week of the commercial&#x27;s rollout, contained a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the production process, a virtual tour of the Accord, the original music video to &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang, and an illustrated guide to all the parts shown in &quot;Cog&quot;. The interactive 30-second versions of &quot;Cog&quot; proved hugely successful. More than 250,000 people used the menu option, spending an average of two-and-a-half minutes in the dedicated advertising area. A significant number watched the looped 120-second version for up to ten minutes. Of those who opened the menu, 10,000 requested either a DVD or a brochure, and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of test drives.

Expansion of the &quot;Cog&quot; campaign to a worldwide market was fraught with a number of logistical difficulties. The cost of airing a 120-second commercial proved prohibitive in most markets. This combined with Honda&#x27;s use of different advertising agencies in different regions and the relative autonomy of its various business units in marketing decisions, meant that &quot;Cog&quot; screened in only a few selected markets: the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia; and in cinemas in only a handful of other countries. For most markets, including the United States, the only way for audiences to see the piece was via the Internet, or in one of a handful of unsolicited and unpaid broadcasts on news channel review programmes. Traffic to Honda websites quadrupled; in the first few weeks, &quot;Cog&quot; was downloaded by over a million people. By mid-May, the number was twice that. It has been estimated that more people in the United States voluntarily chose to watch &quot;Cog&quot; than any other Honda commercial.

In financial terms, &quot;Cog&quot; was an unprecedented success for Honda. The £32,000 spent on placements on the BSkyB network alone achieved a greater response than a previous £1 million direct mailing campaign. Sales of Honda vehicles in the United Kingdom jumped by 28 percent, despite lower marketing and public relations spending by the company and an increase in prices relative to competitors&#x27; vehicles. Visits to Honda dealerships rose from an average of 3,500 to 3,700 per month, with 22 percent of these resulting in the purchase of a Honda, compared to 19 percent before the campaign. In all, &quot;Cog&quot; has been credited with increasing Honda&#x27;s revenue by nearly £400m.

===Media reception===
The media reaction to the advertisement was equally effusive; &quot;The Independent&quot; Peter York described it as creating &quot;the water-cooler ad conversation of the year&quot;, while Quentin Letts of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; believed it was &quot;certain to become an advertising legend&quot;.

===Plagiarism accusations===
Shortly after Cog appeared on television, Wieden+Kennedy received a letter from Peter Fischli and David Weiss, creators of the 1987 art film &quot;Der Lauf der Dinge&quot;. The film was well known in the advertising industry and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept, but had always declined. The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and &quot;Cog&quot;, and warned the agency that they were considering legal action on the basis of the &quot;commercialisation and simplification of the film&#x27;s content and the false impression that [they] might have endorsed the use&quot;. When interviewed by &quot;Creative Review&quot; magazine, the pair made clear that they wished they had been consulted on the advertisement, and that they would not have given permission if asked. Media publications quickly picked up the story, and asserted that Fischli and Weiss were already in the process of litigation against the car manufacturer.

Comparisons were made between the case and that of Mehdi Norowzian, a British director who complained about Diageo&#x27;s, the drinks conglomerate, for allegedly plagiarising his work in its 1994 &quot;Anticipation&quot; campaign for Guinness-brand stout. The matter was complicated by the fact that Wieden+Kennedy acknowledged that the film had served as an &quot;inspiration&quot; for &quot;Cog&quot;, and had distributed copies of the work to its script-writers. Ultimately, Fischli and Weiss did not file a lawsuit against either Wieden+Kennedy or Honda UK.

===Awards===

Despite the lingering shadow of these accusations, &quot;Cog&quot; drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim. It received more awards than any commercial in history; so many that it was both the most-awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd-most-awarded commercial of 2003. The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded; the jury&#x27;s chairman Charles Inge commented: &quot;My own opinion is that this is the best commercial that I have seen for at least ten years.&quot; After awarding &quot;Cog&quot; with several Silver awards, the president-elect of the D&amp;AD Awards, Dick Powell, said of the piece: &quot;It delights and entrances, [...] it communicates engineering quality and quality of thinking, and leaves you with a smile.&quot;

Having swept the majority of award ceremonies within the advertising community to date, &quot;Cog&quot; was widely believed to be the favourite for the industry&#x27;s top award, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Its chief competition was thought to be &quot;Sheet Metal&quot; for Saturn automobiles. &quot;Cog&quot; held a disadvantage in that the chairman of the Cannes voting jury, Dan Wieden, was one of the founders of Wieden+Kennedy, the firm responsible for creating &quot;Cog&quot;; tradition holds that it is bad form for the chairman of the jury to vote for a piece by his or her own agency.

The result at Cannes was a surprise; after the longest judging period in the festival&#x27;s history, the Grand Prix went to neither of the two event favourites. Instead, the jury awarded the prize to &quot;Lamp&quot;, a U.S. advertisement directed by Spike Jonze for the IKEA chain of furniture stores. Voted second was a British ad, &quot;Ear Tennis&quot; for the Xbox video game console. Chief among speculated reasons for the outcome was the plagiarism debate surrounding &quot;Cog&quot;. Ben Walker told &quot;Adweek&quot; &quot;A couple of people on the jury told me the reason it didn&#x27;t win is &#x27;cause they didn&#x27;t want to be seen to be awarding something which people in some corners had said we copied.&quot;

==Legacy==

===In advertising===
The popularity and recognition received by &quot;Cog&quot; led a number of other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the design space. The first of these was &quot;Just Works&quot;, a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. &quot;Just Works&quot; was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, whose previous work included spots for BT Cellnet, Heinz, and Guinness, and the Oscar-nominated short film &quot;Holiday Romance&quot;. Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy its advert, which, under Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second &quot;Just Works&quot; spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. &quot;Just Works&quot; went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Club.

In 2004, BBC Radio Manchester asked for and received permission from Wieden+Kennedy to produce a television advertisement in the style of &quot;Cog&quot; to advertise coverage of football events by local radio stations. The ad, which was directed by Reg Sanders and produced by Tracy Williams, shows pieces of sports equipment such as footballs and team shirts knocking into each other in sequence. In all, 65 versions were broadcast, each tailored to advertise the local BBC Radio station. Wieden+Kennedy were pleased to gain the extra publicity and Neil Christie, managing director of Wieden+Kennedy London, commented: &quot;We are very happy that every time the BBC runs one of their adverts, the person who watches it thinks of Honda.&quot;

&quot;Campaign&quot; magazine listed &quot;Cog&quot;, along with &quot;Balls&quot; for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition televisions, as one of the most-imitated commercials in recent times. Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from &quot;Cog&quot; are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs, &quot;Nearness&quot; for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, a 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage, and the 2007 &quot;Tipping Point&quot;, advertising Guinness stout. When asked about the similarities between &quot;Cog&quot; and &quot;Tipping Point&quot;, Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind &quot;Tipping Point&quot;, replied: &quot;I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, you have to look at things like that and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near &quot;Cog&quot;.&quot;

===Outside advertising===
&quot;Cog&quot; has also inspired a number of other creative endeavours outside of the advertising industry, including an elaborate domino toppling world record attempt by Robin Weijers, and a three-minute introductory trailer to the BBC show &quot;Bang Goes the Theory&quot;. In 2004, the United States Coast Guard Training Centre in California requested permission to use the ad in its training regime as a demonstration of the importance of attention to detail. Discussion of &quot;Cog&quot; as an example of the confluence of art and advertising, and as an example of inspiration versus plagiarism, has been ongoing. Mark Leckey included &quot;Cog&quot; as part of his video art installation &quot;Cinema in the Round&quot;, in the Tate Britain gallery, London, in 2008. It was also the focus of a panel discussion at the Tate Modern during a retrospective of Fischli &amp; Weiss&#x27; work there in 2006.

The next piece created by Wieden+Kennedy for Honda, &quot;Sense&quot;, advertised the company&#x27;s &quot;Integrated Motor System&quot; hybrid car technology. Deliberate steps were taken to distance the spot from &quot;Cog&quot;, using metaphor to make the promotion, rather than focusing on the technology itself. In 2005, Honda was once again in contention for the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Film Festival, with the animated 60-second spot &quot;Grrr&quot;. This time, it returned home triumphant, defeating &quot;Singing in the rain&quot; for the Volkswagen Golf and Stella Artois&#x27; &quot;Pilot&quot; to bring home the top prize. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet went on to direct two further Honda advertisements for Wieden+Kennedy. &quot;Choir&quot;, created with the help of fellow &quot;Cog&quot; team-members Ben Walker and Matt Gooden, was released in 2006, and &quot;Problem Playground&quot; in 2008.

<text>The Jersey is an American comedy television series based on the &quot;Monday Night Football Club&quot; books by Gordon Korman. The series aired on Disney Channel from January 30, 1999, to March 23, 2004.

==Premise==
Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Lighter, Morgan Hudson, Coleman Galloway, and Elliot Riffkin are four teenagers who discover the magic of &quot;the jersey&quot;, a mystical football jersey that transports them into the bodies of professional athletes. This is done in a way that is very similar to how &quot;Sam&quot;, the main character in &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, travels from body to body, and there is a different athlete featured in every episode. The show had several athletes as guest actors, including Dan Lyle, Michael Andretti, Terrell Davis, David Robinson, Malik Rose, Tony Gonzalez, Shannon Sharpe, Donovan McNabb, Tim Couch, Byron Dafoe, Michael Strahan, Kurt Warner, Stephon Marbury, Sergei Fedorov, Kordell Stewart, Jerome Bettis, Junior Seau, Scott Steiner, Booker T, Eddie George, Sabrina Bryan, Randy Johnson, Tony Hawk, Laila Ali, Peyton Manning, and Danny Farmer.

==Cast==
* Michael Galeota as Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Lighter
* Courtnee Draper as Morgan Hudson
* Jermaine Williams as Coleman Galloway
* Brianne Prather as Hilary Lighter
* Cheselka Leigh as Willa Conklin
* Theo Greenly as Elliot Rifkin
* Michael Bofshever as Mr. Lighter
* McNally Sagal as Mrs. Lighter
* Meagan Good as Tamika
* Vance Yudell as Phill Parker

==Production==
The series began production in 1998 with the filming of the pilot episode, &quot;The Magic Jersey&quot;, which aired on Disney Channel as a mid-season special on January 30, 1999. However, its main run wouldn&#x27;t start until later that fall with the airing of &quot;In Training&quot;, which is listed as episode 2 despite being the first episode of the show&#x27;s main run. The series aired for three seasons, and while production on the show wrapped in April 2001, new episodes were shown until March 2004. The last few episodes aired early Saturday mornings on Disney Channel and after all 64 episodes were shown, &quot;The Jersey&quot; was completely taken off the air in June 2004.

<doc id="212813" wikidata="Q203383" url="?curid=212813" title="1984 (advertisement)">
<text>&quot;1984&quot; is an American television commercial that introduced the Apple Macintosh personal computer. It was conceived by Steve Hayden, Brent Thomas, and Lee Clow at Chiat/Day, produced by New York production company Fairbanks Films, and directed by Ridley Scott. The ad was a reference to George Orwell&#x27;s noted 1949 novel, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised &quot;Big Brother&quot;. English athlete Anya Major performed as the unnamed heroine and David Graham as Big Brother. In the US, it first aired in 10 local outlets, including Twin Falls, Idaho, where Chiat/Day ran the ad on December 31, 1983, at the last possible break before midnight on KMVT, so that the advertisement qualified for the 1984 Clio Awards. Its second televised airing, and only US national airing, was on January 22, 1984, during a break in the third quarter of the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS.

In one interpretation of the commercial, &quot;1984&quot; used the unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her white tank top with a stylized line drawing of Apple’s Macintosh computer on it) as a means of saving humanity from &quot;conformity&quot; (Big Brother).

Originally a subject of contention within Apple, it has subsequently been called a watershed event and a masterpiece in advertising. In 1995, The Clio Awards added it to its Hall of Fame, and &quot;Advertising Age&quot; placed it on the top of its list of 50 greatest commercials.

The commercial opens with a dystopian, industrial setting in blue and grayish tones, showing a line of people marching in unison through a long tunnel monitored by a string of telescreens. This is in sharp contrast to the full-color shots of the nameless runner (Anya Major). She looks like a competitive track and field athlete, wearing an athletic outfit (red athletic shorts, running shoes, a white tank top with a cubist picture of Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computer, a white sweat band on her left wrist, and a red one on her right), and is carrying a large brass-headed sledgehammer. Rows of marching minions evoke the opening scenes of &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

As she is chased by four police officers (presumably agents of the Thought Police) wearing black uniforms, protected by riot gear, helmets with visors covering their faces, and armed with large night sticks, she races towards a large screen with the image of a Big Brother-like figure (David Graham, also seen on the telescreens earlier) giving a speech:

The runner, now close to the screen, hurls the hammer towards it, right at the moment Big Brother announces, &quot;we shall prevail!&quot; In a flurry of light and smoke, the screen is destroyed, leaving the audience in shock.

The commercial concludes with a portentous voiceover by actor Edward Grover, accompanied by scrolling black text (in Apple&#x27;s early signature Garamond typeface); the hazy, whitish-blue aftermath of the cataclysmic event serves as the background. It reads:

The screen fades to black as the voiceover ends, and the rainbow Apple logo appears.

==Production==

===Development===

The commercial was created by the advertising agency Chiat/Day, of Venice, California, with copy by Steve Hayden, art direction by Brent Thomas, and creative direction by Lee Clow. The commercial &quot;grew out of an abandoned print campaign&quot; with a specific theme:
Ridley Scott (whose dystopian sci-fi film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; had been released one and a half years prior) was hired by agency producer Richard O&#x27;Neill to direct it. Less than two months after the Super Bowl airing, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Scott &quot;filmed it in England for about $370,000&quot;; In 2005 writer Ted Friedman said the commercial had a then-&quot;unheard-of production budget of $900,000.&quot;
The actors who appeared in the commercial were paid $25 per day. Scott later admitted that he accepted brutal budget constraints because he believed in the ad&#x27;s concept, outlining how the total cost was less than $250,000 and that he used local skinheads to portray the broken, pale &quot;drones&quot; in the commercial.

Steve Jobs and John Sculley were so enthusiastic about the final product that they &quot;...purchased one and a half minutes of ad time for the Super Bowl, annually the most-watched television program in America. In December 1983 they screened the commercial for the Apple Board of Directors. To Jobs&#x27; and Sculley&#x27;s surprise, the entire board hated the commercial.&quot; However, Sculley himself got &quot;cold feet&quot; and asked Chiat/Day to sell off the two commercial spots.

Despite the board&#x27;s dislike of the film, Steve Wozniak and others at Apple showed copies to friends, and he offered to pay for half of the spot personally if Jobs paid the other half. This turned out to be unnecessary. Of the original ninety seconds booked, Chiat/Day resold thirty seconds to another advertiser, then claimed they could not sell the other 60 seconds, when in fact they did not even try.

===Intended message===
In his 1983 Apple keynote address, Steve Jobs read the following story before showcasing a preview of the commercial:

In March 1984 Michael Tyler, a communications expert quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said &quot;The Apple ad expresses a potential of small computers. This potential may not automatically flow from the company&#x27;s product. But if enough people held a shared intent, grass-roots electronic bulletin boards (through which computer users share messages) might result in better balancing of political power.&quot;

In 2004, Adelia Cellini writing for &quot;Macworld&quot;, summarized the message:
==Reception and legacy==
Art director Brent Thomas said Apple &quot;had wanted something to &#x27;stop America in its tracks, to make people think about computers, to make them think about Macintosh.&#x27; With about $3.5 million worth of Macintoshes sold just after the advertisement ran, Thomas judged the effort &#x27;absolutely successful.&#x27; &#x27;We also set out to smash the old that the computer will enslave us,&#x27; he said. &#x27;We did not say the computer will set us free—I have no idea how it will work out. This was strictly a marketing position.&#x27;&quot;

The estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; considered the commercial to be a copyright infringement and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and Chiat/Day in April 1984.

It ranked at number 38 in Channel 4&#x27;s 2000 list of the &quot;100 Greatest TV Ads&quot;.

===Social impact===
Ted Friedman, in his 2005 text, &quot;Electric Dreams: Computers in American Culture&quot;, notes the impact of the commercial:

:Super Bowl viewers were overwhelmed by the startling ad. The ad garnered millions of dollars worth of free publicity, as news programs rebroadcast it that night. It was quickly hailed by many in the advertising industry as a masterwork. &quot;Advertising Age&quot; named it the 1980s &quot;Commercial of the Decade&quot;, and it continues to rank high on lists of the most influential commercials of all time [...] &#x27;1984&#x27; was never broadcast again, adding to its mystique.

The &quot;1984&quot; ad became a signature representation of Apple computers. It was scripted as a thematic element in the 1999 docudrama, &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;, which explores the rise of Apple and Microsoft (the film opens and closes with references to the commercial, including a re-enactment of the heroine running towards the screen of &quot;Big Brother&quot; and clips of the original commercial).

The commercial was also prominent in the 20th anniversary celebration of the Macintosh in 2004, as Apple reposted a new version of the ad on its website and showed it during Jobs&#x27;s Keynote Address at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, California. In this updated version, an iPod, complete with signature white earbuds, was digitally added to the heroine. Keynote Attendees were given a poster showing the heroine with an iPod as a commemorative gift. And the ad has also been cited as the turning point for Super Bowl commercials, which had been important and popular before (especially Coca-Cola&#x27;s &quot;Hey Kid, Catch!&quot; featuring &quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene during Super Bowl XIV) but after &quot;1984&quot; those ads became the most expensive, creative and influential advertising set for all television coverage.

Revisiting the commercial in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; thirty years after it aired, social critic Rebecca Solnit suggested that &quot;1984&quot; did not so much herald a new era of liberation as a new era of oppression. In the December 2014 issue of the magazine, she wrote:
Media archivist (and early Apple supporter) Marion Stokes recorded the Super Bowl broadcast featuring the legendary ad, which was then featured in the 2019 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

=== Parodies===
In 2001, the &quot;Futurama&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Future Stock&quot; parodies the advert as a Planet Express advert challenging the all-powerful &quot;MomCorp&quot;. In the advert a Planet Express employee throws a delivery package into the telescreen showing Mom - however in contrast to the original advert, after the screen is smashed an annoyed prole turns to the employee and shouts &quot;Hey - we were watching that!&quot;

In March 2007, the advertisement attracted attention again when &quot;Hillary 1984&quot;, a video mashup of the original commercial with footage of Hillary Clinton used in place of Big Brother, went viral in the early stages of the campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. The video was produced in support of Barack Obama by Phil de Vellis, an employee of Blue State Digital, but was made without the knowledge of either Obama&#x27;s campaign or his own employer. De Vellis stated that he made the video in one afternoon at home using a Mac and some software. Political commentators including Carla Marinucci and Arianna Huffington, as well as de Vellis himself, suggested that the video demonstrated the way technology had created new opportunities for individuals to make an impact on politics.

The 2008 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;MyPods and Boomsticks&quot; parodies the ad. In it, Comic Book Guy throws a sledgehammer at a giant screen that displays the CEO &quot;Steve Mobs&quot;.

In May 2010, Valve released a short video announcing the release of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; on OS X featuring a recreation of the original commercial, with the people replaced with City 17&#x27;s citizens, Big Brother with a speech from Wallace Breen, the agents of the Thought Police with Combine Soldiers, and the nameless runner with Alyx Vance. It is Valve&#x27;s only official Half-Life 2 SFM.

In the 2016 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Last Traction Hero&quot;, Lisa Simpson is a bus monitor and fantasizes about being on a big screen controlling the bus children with Bart Simpson as the runner with the hammer. 

On August 13, 2020, Apple removed &quot;Fortnite&quot; from the App Store after Epic Games introduced a direct payment option that circumvented Apple&#x27;s 30% revenue cut policy, violating terms of service policies. In response, Epic filed a lawsuit against Apple, and created a parody of the &quot;1984&quot; ad called &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite&quot;.

The 2024 Pixar animated film &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; contains a loose parody of the ad, in which the character Joy riles up the Mind Workers to rebel against Anxiety; one worker throws a chair at the giant screen Anxiety uses to monitor their work.

<doc id="212818" wikidata="Q213449" url="?curid=212818" title="Eating">
<text>Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food. In biology, this is typically done to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and nutrients and to allow for growth. Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies.

For humans, eating is more complex, but is typically an activity of daily living. Physicians and dieticians consider a healthful diet essential for maintaining peak physical condition. Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. This may be a result of a lifestyle choice: as part of a diet or as religious fasting. Limited consumption may be due to hunger or famine. Overconsumption of calories may lead to obesity and the reasons behind it are myriad, however, its prevalence has led some to declare an &quot;obesity epidemic&quot;.

==Eating practices among humans==


Many homes have a large kitchen area devoted to preparation of meals and food, and may have a dining room, dining hall, or another designated area for eating.

Most societies also have restaurants, food courts, and food vendors so that people may eat when away from home, when lacking time to prepare food, or as a social occasion. At their highest level of sophistication, these places become &quot;theatrical spectacles of global cosmopolitanism and myth.&quot; At picnics, potlucks, and food festivals, eating is the primary purpose of a social gathering. At many social events, food and beverages are made available to attendees.

People usually have two or three meals a day. Snacks of smaller amounts may be consumed between meals. Doctors in the UK recommend three meals a day (with between 400 and 600 kcal per meal), with four to six hours between. Having three well-balanced meals (described as: half of the plate with vegetables, 1/4 protein food as meat, [...] and 1/4 carbohydrates as pasta, rice) will then amount to some 1800–2000 kcal, which is the average requirement for a regular person.

In jurisdictions under Sharia law, it may be proscribed for Muslim adults during the daylight hours of Ramadan.

==Development in humans==

Newborn babies do not eat adult foods. They survive solely on breast milk or formula. Small amounts of pureed food are sometimes fed to young infants as young as two or three months old, but most infants do not eat adult food until they are between six and eight months old. Young babies eat pureed baby foods because they have few teeth and immature digestive systems. Between 8 and 12 months of age, the digestive system improves, and many babies begin eating finger foods. Their diet is still limited, however, because most babies lack molars or canines at this age, and often have a limited number of incisors. By 18 months, babies often have enough teeth and a sufficiently mature digestive system to eat the same foods as adults. Learning to eat is a messy process for children, and children often do not master neatness or eating etiquette until they are five or six years old.

===Eating positions===
Eating positions vary according to the different regions of the world, as culture influences the way people eat their meals.
For example, most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting at a table.

Eating in a reclining position was favored by the Ancient Greeks at a celebration they called a symposium, and this custom was adopted by the Ancient Romans. Ancient Hebrews also adopted this posture for traditional celebrations of Passover.

===Compulsive overeating===

Compulsive overeating, or emotional eating, is &quot;the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions&quot;. Empirical studies have indicated that anxiety leads to decreased food consumption in people with normal weight and increased food consumption in the obese.

Many laboratory studies showed that overweight individuals are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to overeat when distressed than people of normal weight. Furthermore, it was consistently found that obese individuals experience negative emotions more frequently and more intensively than do normal weight persons.

The naturalistic study by Lowe and Fisher compared the emotional reactivity and emotional eating of normal and overweight female college students. The study confirmed the tendency of obese individuals to overeat, but these findings applied only to snacks, not to meals. That means that obese individuals did not tend to eat more while having meals; rather, the amount of snacks they ate between meals was greater. One possible explanation that Lowe and Fisher suggest is obese individuals often eat their meals with others and do not eat more than average due to the reduction of distress because of the presence of other people. Another possible explanation would be that obese individuals do not eat more than the others while having meals due to social desirability. Conversely, snacks are usually eaten alone.

===Hunger and satiety===

There are many physiological mechanisms that control starting and stopping a meal. The control of food intake is a physiologically complex, motivated behavioral system. Hormones such as cholecystokinin, bombesin, neurotensin, anorectin, calcitonin, enterostatin, leptin and corticotropin-releasing hormone have all been shown to suppress food intake.

Eating rapidly leads to obesity and overeating, probably because the feelings of satiety can be slower. 

====Initiation====

There are numerous signals given off that initiate hunger. There are environmental signals, signals from the gastrointestinal system, and metabolic signals that trigger hunger. The environmental signals come from the body&#x27;s senses. The feeling of hunger could be triggered by the smell and thought of food, the sight of a plate, or hearing someone talk about food. The signals from the stomach are initiated by the release of the peptide hormone ghrelin. Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite by signaling to the brain that a person is hungry.

Environmental signals and ghrelin are not the only signals that initiate hunger, there are other metabolic signals as well. As time passes between meals, the body starts to take nutrients from long-term reservoirs. When the glucose levels of cells drop (glucoprivation), the body starts to produce the feeling of hunger. The body also stimulates eating by detecting a drop in cellular lipid levels (lipoprivation). Both the brain and the liver monitor the levels of metabolic fuels. The brain checks for glucoprivation on its side of the blood–brain barrier (since glucose is its fuel), while the liver monitors the rest of the body for both lipoprivation and glucoprivation.

====Termination====
There are short-term signals of satiety that arise from the head, the stomach, the intestines, and the liver. The long-term signals of satiety come from adipose tissue. The taste and odor of food can contribute to short-term satiety, allowing the body to learn when to stop eating. The stomach contains receptors to allow us to know when we are full. The intestines also contain receptors that send satiety signals to the brain. The hormone cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum, and it controls the rate at which the stomach is emptied. This hormone is thought to be a satiety signal to the brain. Peptide YY 3-36 is a hormone released by the small intestine and it is also used as a satiety signal to the brain. Insulin also serves as a satiety signal to the brain. The brain detects insulin in the blood, which indicates that nutrients are being absorbed by cells and a person is getting full. Long-term satiety comes from the fat stored in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin, and leptin suppresses appetite. Long-term satiety signals from adipose tissue regulates short-term satiety signals.

Cessation of eating within two hours of sleeping can reduce body weight.

====Role of the brain====
The brain stem can control food intake, because it contains neural circuits that detect hunger and satiety signals from other parts of the body. The brain stem&#x27;s involvement of food intake has been researched using rats. Rats that have had the motor neurons in the brain stem disconnected from the neural circuits of the cerebral hemispheres (decerebration), are unable to approach and eat food. Instead, they must obtain their food in a liquid form. This research shows that the brain stem does in fact play a role in eating.

There are two peptides in the hypothalamus that produce hunger, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin. MCH plays a bigger role in producing hunger. In mice, MCH stimulates feeding and a mutation causing the overproduction of MCH led to overeating and obesity. Orexin plays a greater role in controlling the relationship between eating and sleeping. Other peptides in the hypothalamus that induce eating are neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP).

Satiety in the hypothalamus is stimulated by leptin. Leptin targets the receptors on the arcuate nucleus and suppresses the secretion of MCH and orexin. The arcuate nucleus also contains two more peptides that suppress hunger. The first one is cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), the second is α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone).

==Disorders==
Physiologically, eating is generally triggered by hunger, but there are numerous physical and psychological conditions that can affect appetite and disrupt normal eating patterns. These include depression, food allergies, ingestion of certain chemicals, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, pituitary gland malfunction and other endocrine problems, and numerous other illnesses and eating disorders. A chronic lack of nutritious food can cause various illnesses, and will eventually lead to starvation. 

While changes in appetite can result from various physical and psychological conditions, including depression, allergies, and anxiety; anorexia and bulimia are specific eating disorders that profoundly impact the entire body. In anorexia nervosa, people restrict their calorie intake out of fear of gaining weight. This malnutrition leads to an unhealthy weight, significantly impacting overall health. Bulimia is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, involving the consumption of a substantial amount of food within a short period. Subsequently, individuals engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as inducing vomiting, excessive physical activity, and using laxatives as compensatory measures.

If eating and drinking is not possible, as is often the case when recovering from surgery, alternatives are enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition.

<text>Baiotomeus is a genus of mammals from the extinct order of Multituberculata. It is known from the Paleocene of North America.

The genus &quot;Baiotomeus&quot; was formally named by Krause in 1987 (Krause, 1987), and has also been known as &quot;Mimetodon&quot; (partly), &quot;Neoplagiaulax&quot; (partly), and &quot;Ptilodus&quot; (partly).

== Species ==
=== &quot;B. douglassi&quot; ===
&quot;Baiotomeus douglassi&quot; is a fairly substantial multituberculate weighing almost 200 g. Remains have been found in the Fort Union Formation of Montana and Porcupine Hills Formation of Alberta, Canada. The holotype specimen hails from Wyoming in the United States, in strata of the Gidley Quarry dated to the Torrejonian stage of the Paleocene.

The species was originally named &quot;Ptilodus douglassi&quot; by Simpson in 1935 (Simpson, 1935), but it has been reclassified several times:
* &quot;Mimetodon douglassi&quot; in 1940, by Jepsen
* &quot;Neoplagiaulax douglassi&quot; in 1974, by Schiebout

It was finally assigned to &quot;Baiotomeus&quot; by Hartman in 1986 — which is &quot;before&quot; Krause formally established the genus in 1987.

=== &quot;B. lamberti&quot; ===
Remains of &quot;Baiotomeus lamberti&quot; have been discovered in Montana in the United States, in the Medicine Rocks of the Tongue River Formation, which have been dated to the Paleocene.

Several specimens, including the holotype, are at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale. Collected in 1958 and 1965, these were originally described as belonging to &quot;Mimetodon&quot;. It was given its current name in 1987 by Krause (Krause, 1987). &quot;B. lamberti&quot; has also been confused with &quot;Ptilodus montanus&quot;.

=== &quot;B. russelli&quot; ===
&quot;Baiotomeus russelli&quot; has been discovered in Alberta, Canada, in Cochrane 2 of the Paskapoo Formation, which has been dated to the lower Tiffanian stage of the Paleocene.

Remains consist of nine upper premolars, (P4), which average nearly 2.5 mm in length. This is smaller than the teeth of other genus members; from front to back, approximately 45% less than &quot;B. douglassi&quot; and 40% less than &quot;B. lamberti&quot;. The rows of cusps also display a strong curvature and the cuspate anterolabial lobe is better developed. There is more variation in the height of the cusps among the middle row. These particular premolars — P4s — have three rows of cusps, of which there seem to be about 15 or so in all. In addition, &quot;the enamel is weakly wrinkled on all specimens&quot;. (Scott &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002)

According to the same authors:
:At present, P4s are the only specimens from Cochrane 2 that we can identify as pertaining to &quot;B. russelli&quot;. Although knowledge of this species is limited, we consider its naming to be justified based on the diagnostic morphology of ultimate fourth premolars in ptilodontids generally (Krause 1982, 1987) and the unique structure of these teeth.

The species name honours L. S. Russell &quot;for his pioneering research on the mammals from Cochrane 2&quot;. All presently identified remains are part of the collection of the University of Alberta.

Cochrane 2 has also been interpreted as correlating to the Porcupine Hills Formation, but recent studies suggest that it is part of the Paskapoo, as originally concluded by Russell in 1929.

<doc id="212822" wikidata="Q503201" url="?curid=212822" title="Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)">
<text>Divisional-General Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc (17 March 1772 – 2 November 1802) was a French Army officer who served in the French Revolutionary Wars. He was the husband of Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon. In 1801, Leclerc was appointed commander of the Saint-Domingue expedition with the goal of restoring French rule and slavery in the colony of Saint-Domingue and deposing Governor-General Toussaint Louverture. The expedition defeated Louverture&#x27;s army and deported him to France, but Leclerc died of yellow fever after the colony&#x27;s Black population revolted against French rule.

==Early life==

Charles Leclerc was born on 17 March 1772 in Pontoise, Île-de-France. In 1791, he volunteered to join the French Royal Army, serving as a second lieutenant in the 12th Regiment of Chasseurs à Cheval before becoming an aide-de-camp to Jean François Cornu de La Poype. Leclerc remained loyal to the French First Republic which replaced the Kingdom of France and was promoted to the rank of captain, serving as the chief of staff of a French Revolutionary Army division during the siege of Toulon in 1793, where he met Napoleon for the first time.

Following the capture of Toulon, he served in the Army of the Rhine and fought in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, participating in the battles of Castiglione and Rivoli and rising to the rank of brigade general by 1797. Leclerc was subsequently ordered to bring news of the Peace of Leoben to the French Directory in Paris. Napoleon&#x27;s sister Pauline Bonaparte, who had a large number of suitors, was pressing him to have her married off to a man of his choosing. Upon Leclerc&#x27;s return to Paris, he accepted Napoleon&#x27;s offer to marry Pauline. The couple would go on to have one child, Dermide Leclerc, and resided in the Château de Montgobert.

Leclerc was later appointed as chief of staff under Louis-Alexandre Berthier and Guillaume Brune, participating in the second French expedition to Ireland led by Jean Joseph Amable Humbert in 1798. After Napoleon returned from the French invasion of Egypt and Syria, he promoted Leclerc to the rank of divisional general  and sent him back to the Army of the Rhine, then under Jean Victor Marie Moreau&#x27;s command. He subsequently participated in the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 which made Napoleon the First Consul of France. During the coup, supported by Joachim Murat, Leclerc ordered a detachment of grenadiers to march into the Council of Five Hundred.

He later fought in the War of the Second Coalition, including at the battle of Hohenlinden, receiving the supreme command of the 17th, 18th, and 19th divisions of the French army. Leclerc was then appointed as commander-in-chief of a French army corps that Napoleon planned to send to Portugal to force the Portuguese government to renounce the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, though that expedition never took place.

==Saint-Domingue==

In 1791, enslaved Black people in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti) launched a slave rebellion which initiated the Haitian Revolution. Two years later in August 1793, French commissioner Léger-Félicité Sonthonax officially abolished slavery on Saint-Domingue as part of an effort to win over Haitians to the cause of the French First Republic. Prominent Haitian leader Toussaint Louverture, himself a former slave, joined the French Republicans shortly afterwards. By 1801, Louverture had consolidated his rule over the entire island of Hispaniola. In July 1801, he promulgated a new constitution for Saint-Domingue which appointed himself as governor for life, while simultaneously reaffirming the colony&#x27;s position as &quot;part of the French empire.&quot;

Upon receiving news from Saint-Domingue in October 1801, Napoleon interpreted Louverture&#x27;s new constitution as an unacceptable offense to French colonial authority, and subsequently appointed Leclerc as the commander of a military expedition to restore France&#x27;s authority in Saint-Domingue. In his initial instructions, Napoleon directed Leclerc to liquidate Louverture&#x27;s government and deport his military officers to France, while publicly maintaining the abolition of slavery in Saint-Domingue. Napoleon announced his intentions to reinstate slavery in the neighbouring Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, which Louverture&#x27;s forces had recently occupied. Secretly, Napoleon planned to reinstate slavery in Saint-Domingue once Louverture had been detained by French troops.

Leclerc left Brest, France in December 1801 at the head of a French Navy fleet transporting 40,000 troops, publicly repeating Bonaparte&#x27;s promise that &quot;all of the people of Saint-Domingue are French&quot; and would remain forever free. Louverture&#x27;s harsh discipline had made him numerous enemies, and Leclerc played off the ambitions of Louverture&#x27;s officers and competitors against each other, promising them that they would maintain their ranks in the French army and convincing them to abandon Louverture. The French won several victories against Haitian forces and regained control of Saint-Domingue in three months after fierce fighting, with Louverture forced to negotiate a surrender with Leclerc which resulted in him being placed under house arrest in his plantations. However, Napoleon had given secret instructions to Leclerc to arrest Louverture, which he did during a meeting before deporting him to France, where Louverture died in 1803 while imprisoned at Fort de Joux in the Jura Mountains.

Despite his superiors&#x27; warnings, Leclerc did not consolidate his victory by disarming Louverture&#x27;s officers and troops. After a brief period in which he incorporated many of Louverture&#x27;s officers into his own army, Haitians in Leclerc&#x27;s forces began to desert during the second half of 1802. These desertions, along with uprisings by Haitians against French rule, occurred in response to news that slavery had been reestablished in the nearby French colony of Guadeloupe. The prospect of a similar restoration of slavery in Saint-Domingue swung the tide inexorably against French hopes of reimposing control, as Leclerc began summarily executing suspected conspirators en masse.

By October 1802, Leclerc wrote a letter to Napoleon advocating for a war of annihilation, declaring that &quot;We must destroy all the blacks of the mountains – men and women – and spare only children under 12 years of age. We must destroy half of those in the plains and must not leave a single colored person in the colony who has worn an epaulette.&quot; He also lamented his assignment in the letter, declaring &quot;My soul is withered, and no joyful thought can ever make forget these hideous scenes.&quot; In the meantime, more Black officers defected from Leclerc&#x27;s army, including Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe. After Christophe massacred several hundred Polish soldiers at Port-de-Paix following his defection, Leclerc ordered the arrest of all remaining Black troops in French service in Le Cap, executing 1,000 of them by tying sacks of flour to their necks and pushing them off the side of ships.

==Death and legacy==
In November 1802, Leclerc died of yellow fever, which had already decimated his army. Pauline returned to Europe, where she later married the Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona. Leclerc was succeeded in his command by Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, whose similarly brutal tactics drove more Haitians to resist the French. On 18 November 1803, François Capois defeated Rochambeau&#x27;s army in the Battle of Vertières. Dessalines proclaimed the independence of Saint-Domingue as Haiti on 1 January 1804. In the meantime, Leclerc&#x27;s body had been transported to France by Pauline and buried on one of his estates.

A statue at Pontoise depicts Leclerc in his French army uniform, his scabbard touching the earth. It was placed by Louis Nicolas Davout and his second wife Louise-Aimée-Julie at the top of a staircase built in 1869 by François Lemot. Around three metres high, the statue is on a square stone pedestal inscribed with information on him in gold majuscule letters. It adjoins the south side of the Pontoise Cathedral. There is also a statue of him by Jean Guillaume Moitte in the Pantheon de Paris, and another statue of Leclerc fully nude at the Palace of Versailles which was sculpted by Charles Dupaty.

<text>Kimbetohia is a genus of mammal belonging to the extinct order Multituberculata. It lived from the Upper Cretaceous to the Paleocene period in the United States.

==Taxonomy==
Two species are known. The type species, &quot;Kimbetohia campi&quot;, has been found in New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, in the Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan Basin. The deposits date from the Maastrichtian stage of the Upper Cretaceous to the Puercan stage of the Paleocene. Some material associated with this species was referred to as &quot;Clemensodon megaloba&quot;, by D. W. Krause in 1992. The second species, &quot;K. mzaie&quot;, is known from deposits of the Denver Formation, in Colorado, which has been dated to the Puercan stage of the Lower Paleocene.

<text>Seka (born Dorothiea Ivonniea Hundley,) is an American pornographic actress who was known in the 1980s as the Platinum Princess of Porn. In 2013, she released an autobiography about her life and career, titled &quot;Inside Seka&quot;.

==Early life==
Seka was born in 1954 in Radford, Virginia. She recalled having &quot;a plain, normal childhood&quot; with two siblings, a brother and sister. Her family later moved to Hopewell, Virginia, where, nicknamed &quot;Dottie&quot;, she won a beauty pageant at Hopewell High School. She was later crowned Miss Southside Virginia.

She married Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Patton on April 21, 1972, a week after her 18th birthday. She worked for Reynolds Metals Company, maker of Reynolds Wrap household aluminum. She later became a clerk at an adult bookstore, where she began dating the owner.

==Career==
===Beginnings: 1970s–1990s===
After briefly operating a chain of seven adult bookstores in Virginia, Seka sold her interest in the business and moved to Las Vegas, where she did her first erotic modeling for a magazine. She later moved to Los Angeles, where she appeared in her first pornographic film. She told an interviewer in 2006:

Seka used the stage name &quot;Linda Grasser&quot; early in her career. She eventually adopted the name &quot;Seka&quot; after a female blackjack dealer she knew in Las Vegas. By the mid-1980s, she was writing and directing adult films, as well as starring in them.

She stopped performing in pornography in 1992 because of what she saw as the adult film industry&#x27;s poor response to the AIDS epidemic, including an unwillingness to require condom use or routine HIV screening. She would go on to model for &quot;Club&quot; magazine and release videos through the website &quot;AEBN&quot;, as well as performing striptease on tour.

===Later appearances===
For several years beginning in 1994, Seka hosted a talk show called &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Sex&quot; on Chicago FM radio station WLUP.

In 2005, she moved from Chicago to Kansas City, operating her fan club through her 
own website. In February 2007 she announced her first hardcore scene in nearly 15 years, distributed via online pay-per-view.

Seka has appeared on various television talk shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Phil Donahue Show, and The Morton Downey Jr. Show. She appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the 1980s and was interviewed for the documentary &quot;After Porn Ends&quot; (2012).

===Reception and legacy===

&quot;PopMatters&quot; describes Seka as &quot;one of the adult industry&#x27;s most recognizable superstars&quot;. She was known as the adult film world&#x27;s &quot;Platinum Princess&quot; whom the magazine &quot;High Society&quot; called the &quot;Marilyn Monroe of porn&quot;. Pornographic film actor Jamie Gillis, who performed with her numerous times, said &quot;Seka was porn, but a little above itsort of a white trash queen in a way&quot;. Director Brian DePalma stated Seka had genuine acting talent. 

In the DVD commentary for the film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), director Paul Thomas Anderson stated that she was the main inspiration for his character of Amber Waves due to her involvement in a documentary about pornographic film actor John Holmes.

==Personal life==
Seka was married to Frank Patton from 1972, to no later than 1977. She dated comedian Sam Kinison in the mid-1980s, crediting him for arranging her appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;

==Awards==
Seka is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame, XRCO Hall of Fame, and Urban X Hall of Fame.

<doc id="212831" wikidata="Q778375" url="?curid=212831" title="Prochetodon">
<text>Prochetodon is a genus of mammals from the extinct order Multituberculata. It lived during the Upper Paleocene and the Lower Eocene in North America. The genus was formally named by G. L. Jepsen in 1940. (Jepsen, 1940)

== &quot;P. cavus&quot; ==

The species &quot;Prochetodon cavus&quot; weighed about 135 g. Remains have been discovered in Wyoming, in the United States. They were found in the Princeton Quarry, and the deposits were dated from the Upper Paleocene to the Lower Eocene. Material is in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale. The species was named by G. L. Jepsen in 1940. (Jepsen, 1940)

== &quot;P. foxi&quot; ==

The species &quot;Prochetodon foxi&quot; weighed about 200 g. Remains have been discovered in Wyoming and Montana in the United States, in the Long Draw Quarry, and in the Swan Hills of Alberta, Canada. The strata are dated to the Upper Paleocene. The species was named by David. W. Krause in 1987. (Krause, 1987)

== &quot;P. taxus&quot; ==

The species &quot;Prochetodon taxus&quot; weighed about 190 g. Remains have been discovered in Wyoming, in the United States, in the deposits of Clark&#x27;s Fork Basin, which have been dated to the Upper Paleocene. David Krause first tentatively referred to the species &quot;P. cf. cavus&quot; in 1980, and then gave it its current classification in 1987. (Krause, 1987)

<doc id="212832" wikidata="Q949603" url="?curid=212832" title="Pied crow">
<text>The pied crow (Corvus albus) is a widely distributed African bird species in the crow genus of the family Corvidae.

Structurally, the pied crow is better thought of as a small crow-sized raven, especially as it can hybridise with the Somali crow (dwarf raven) where their ranges meet in the Horn of Africa. Its behaviour, though, is more typical of the Eurasian carrion crows, and it may be a modern link (along with the Somali crow) between the Eurasian crows and the common raven.

==Description==
It is about the size of the European carrion crow or a little larger (46–50 cm in length), but has a proportionately larger bill, slightly longer tail and wings, and longer legs. As its name suggests, its glossy black head and neck are interrupted by a large area of white feathering from the shoulders down to the lower breast. The tail, bill, and wings are black, too. The eyes are dark brown. The white plumage of immature birds is often mixed with black. It resembles the white-necked and thick-billed ravens, but has a much smaller bill.

=== Measurements ===
* Length 46 – 52 cm
* Wing 328 to 388 mm (17 unsexed birds)
* Weight 520 g

=== Identification ===
In southern Africa, its range overlaps with the white-necked raven. The pied crow is slightly smaller and has a white chest and belly with a black, more delicate beak compared to the black chest and belly of the larger white-necked raven, which also has a white-tipped and weightier beak.
It is larger than the black crow.

=== Voice ===
The voice is often described as a harsh &quot;ar-ar-ar-ar&quot; or &quot;karh-karh-karh&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The pied crow was first described in 1776 by Statius Muller. Its specific name is the Latin adjective &quot;albus&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;.

The Maasai people call it &quot;ol-korrok&quot; from the sound of its call. It is considered annoying, but not a bird of ill omen.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species, Africa&#x27;s most widespread member of the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;, occurs from sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, South Africa and on the large island of Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, Aldabra, Assumption Island, Cosmoledo, Astove Island, Zanzibar, Pemba, and Fernando Po. It inhabits mainly open country with villages and towns nearby. It does not occur in the equatorial rainforest region. It is rarely seen very far from human habitation, though it is not as tied to the urban way of life as the house crow (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;) of Asia, and may be encountered far from human habitation in Eritrea.

==Behaviour==

Pied crows are generally encountered in pairs or small groups, although an abundant source of food may bring together large numbers of birds. The species behaves in a similar manner to the hooded and carrion crows. In Dakar, birds have been observed mobbing passing ospreys and snake eagles, but avoiding black kites.

===Diet===
All of its food is obtained from the ground, trees, etc., including injured wildlife such as insects and other small invertebrates, small reptiles, small mammals, young birds and eggs, grain, peanuts, carrion, and any scraps of human food and fruit. It has been recorded killing and eating roosting fruit bats, and is frequently seen (sometimes in huge numbers) scavenging around slaughterhouses.

===Digestion in the small intestine===
The small intestines within the African pied crows include duodena, jejuna, and ilea, which are vital components for nutrient absorption, such as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates consumed by the crow.

Pancreatic ducts and two bile ducts make up the duodenum, so provide greater support for nutrient digestion. The wall of the small intestine is lined with four main tunics - tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, tunica musclaris, and tunica serosa. The primary purpose of the said tunics is to protect the inner environment of the small intestine against foreign invaders that could otherwise harm the crow.

Pied crows tend to operate with restricted digestive capacity despite being capable of consuming greater than half their body weight of food per day. To maintain their slender weight, these birds rely on this reduced digestive capacity to aid in food regulation to ensure they can fly swiftly.

Pied crows obtain a characteristic looping and spiraling of their small intestines, which enhances their digestion and absorption of nutrients. These birds also obtain restricted gut retention time for food, but to combat this, they also have increased mucosal surface area evident within their digestive tracts.

===Reproduction===
The nest is usually built in tall, isolated trees, though sometimes smaller specimens are used, depending on availability. The cross supports of telephone poles are also frequently used, and both sexes build the nest. A clutch of three to six eggs is laid from September to November (depending on latitude) and are pale green spotted with various shades of brown. The eggs are normally covered when the incubating female leaves the nest. Incubation is 18–19 days and the young are usually fledged by around 45 days. Both sexes rear the young.

<text>Jiří Mucha (12 March 1915 in Prague – 5 April 1991 in Prague) was a Czech journalist, writer, screenwriter, author of autobiographical novels and studies of the works of his father, the painter Alphonse Mucha.

== Life ==
Born in Prague, he was working in Paris as a correspondent for &quot;Lidové noviny&quot; when Nazi Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939. It was at this time he wrote the Czech libretto for Martinů&#x27;s &quot;Field Mass&quot;. He returned to Prague briefly for his father&#x27;s funeral in July of the same year but was able to return to Paris and later joined the newly formed 1st Czechoslovak Division in France in Agde. Following the fall of France, Mucha made his way to the United Kingdom, where he joined the Royal Air Force before becoming a war correspondent for the BBC, where he was known as George Mucha. He returned to Prague in 1945. In 1951 he was arrested by the country&#x27;s Communist government for alleged espionage, and following the demands of the state prosecutor for the death penalty, he was ultimately sentenced to hard labor in the Jáchymov uranium mines. He was released from prison in 1955, allegedly due to the efforts of his wife Geraldine, but according to other records, it was due to his agreement to work for the State Security Police (StB). In 1989, following the Velvet Revolution, which brought down the communist regime, he became chairman of the Czech PEN club. He died of cancer in 1991.

==Family==
His first wife was Czech composer Vítězslava Kaprálová (1915–40). His second wife was Geraldine Thomson-Mucha (1917–2012), a Scottish born composer who lived in Prague until her death on 12 October 2012. Mucha had two children: a son, John, now President of the Mucha Foundation, with his wife Geraldine, and a daughter, Jarmila Plocková, with Vlasta Plocková.

Painter Jaroslava Muchová was his sister.

<doc id="212838" wikidata="Q155907" url="?curid=212838" title="Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir George Gabriel Stokes, 1st Baronet, (; 13 August 1819 – 1 February 1903) was an Irish mathematician and physicist. Born in County Sligo, Ireland, Stokes spent all of his career at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 1849 until his death in 1903. As a physicist, Stokes made seminal contributions to fluid mechanics, including the Navier–Stokes equations; and to physical optics, with notable works on polarisation and fluorescence. As a mathematician, he popularised &quot;Stokes&#x27; theorem&quot; in vector calculus and contributed to the theory of asymptotic expansions. Stokes, along with Felix Hoppe-Seyler, first demonstrated the oxygen transport function of haemoglobin, and showed colour changes produced by the aeration of haemoglobin solutions.

Stokes was made a baronet by the British monarch in 1889. In 1893 he received the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal, then the most prestigious scientific prize in the world, &quot;for his researches and discoveries in physical science&quot;. He represented Cambridge University in the British House of Commons from 1887 to 1892, sitting as a Conservative. Stokes also served as president of the Royal Society from 1885 to 1890 and was briefly the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge. Stokes&#x27;s extensive correspondence and his work as Secretary of the Royal Society has led him to be referred to as a gatekeeper of Victorian science, with his contributions surpassing his own published papers.

==Biography==
George Stokes was the youngest son of the Reverend Gabriel Stokes (died 1834), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland who served as rector of Skreen in County Sligo, and his wife Elizabeth Haughton, daughter of the Reverend John Haughton. Stokes&#x27;s home life was strongly influenced by his father&#x27;s evangelical Protestantism: three of his brothers entered the Church, of whom the most eminent was John Whitley Stokes, Archdeacon of Armagh. Alongside a lifelong commitment to his Protestant faith, Stokes&#x27;s childhood in Skreen had a strong influence on his later decision to pursue fluid dynamics as a research area. His daughter, Isabella Humphreys, wrote that her father &quot;told me that he was nearly carried away by one of these great waves when bathing as a boy off the coast of Sligo, and this first attracted his attention to waves&quot;.

John and George were always close, and George lived with John while attending school in Dublin. Of all his family he was closest to his sister Elizabeth. Their mother was remembered in the family as &quot;beautiful but very stern&quot;. After attending schools in Skreen, Dublin and Bristol, in 1837 Stokes matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Four years later he graduated as senior wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizeman, achievements that earned him election as a fellow of the college.

In accordance with the college statutes, Stokes had to resign the fellowship when he married in 1857. Twelve years later, under new statutes, he was re-elected to the fellowship and he retained that place until 1902, when on the day before his 83rd birthday, he was elected as the college&#x27;s Master. Stokes did not hold that position for long, for he died at Cambridge on 1 February the following year, and was buried in the Mill Road cemetery. There is also a memorial to him in the north aisle at Westminster Abbey.

===Career===
In 1849, Stokes was appointed to the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge, a position he held until his death in 1903. On 1 June 1899, the jubilee of this appointment was celebrated there in a ceremony attended by numerous delegates from European and American universities. A commemorative gold medal was presented to Stokes by the chancellor of the university and marble busts of Stokes by Hamo Thornycroft were formally offered to Pembroke College and to the university by Lord Kelvin. At 54 years, Stokes&#x27;s tenure as the Lucasian Professor was the longest in history.

Stokes, who was made a baronet in 1889, further served his university by representing it in parliament from 1887 to 1892 as one of the two members for the Cambridge University constituency. In 1885–1890 he was also president of the Royal Society, of which he had been one of the secretaries since 1854. As he was also Lucasian Professor at this time, Stokes was the first person to hold all three positions simultaneously; Newton held the same three, although not at the same time.

Stokes was the oldest of the trio of natural philosophers, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin being the other two, who especially contributed to the fame of the Cambridge school of mathematical physics in the middle of the 19th century.

Stokes&#x27;s original work began about 1840, and is distinguished for its quantity and quality. The Royal Society&#x27;s catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or corrective statements, but many are long and elaborate treatises.

==Contributions to science==

In scope, Stokes&#x27;s work covered a wide range of physical inquiry but, as Marie Alfred Cornu remarked in his Rede Lecture of 1899, the greater part of it was concerned with waves and the transformations imposed on them during their passage through various media.

===Fluid dynamics===
Stokes&#x27;s first published papers, which appeared in 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another on the effects of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums. To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced by the nature of the gas in which the sound is produced. These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in the air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships.

====Creeping flow====
Stokes&#x27;s work on fluid motion and viscosity led to his calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium. This became known as Stokes&#x27; law. He derived an expression for the frictional force (also called drag force) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers.

His work is the basis of the falling sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes&#x27;s law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.

The same theory explains why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and hail). Similar use of the equation can be made in the settlement of fine particles in water or other fluids.

&quot;stokes&quot;, the CGS unit of kinematic viscosity, was named in recognition of his work.

===Light===

Perhaps his best-known researches are those which deal with the wave theory of light. His optical work began at an early period in his scientific career. His first papers on the aberration of light appeared in 1845 and 1846, and were followed in 1848 by one on the theory of certain bands seen in the spectrum.

In 1849 he published a long paper on the dynamical theory of diffraction, in which he showed that the plane of polarisation must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Two years later he discussed the colours of thick plates.

Stokes also investigated George Airy&#x27;s mathematical description of rainbows. Airy&#x27;s findings involved an integral that was awkward to evaluate. Stokes expressed the integral as a divergent series, which were little understood. However, by cleverly truncating the series (i.e., ignoring all except the first few terms of the series), Stokes obtained an accurate approximation to the integral that was far easier to evaluate than the integral itself. Stokes&#x27;s research on asymptotic series led to fundamental insights about such series.

===Fluorescence===

In 1852, in his famous paper on the change of wavelength of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes&#x27;s honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes&#x27;s explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, is the basis of Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.

===Polarization===

In the same year, 1852, there appeared the paper on the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources, and in 1853 an investigation of the metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances. The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates; and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction, a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes. Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar, transparent calcite crystals.

A paper on the long spectrum of the electric light bears the same date, and was followed by an inquiry into the absorption spectrum of blood.

===Chemical analysis===
The chemical identification of organic bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864; and later, in conjunction with the Rev. William Vernon Harcourt, he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various glasses, with reference to the conditions of transparency and the improvement of achromatic telescopes. A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives.

===Ophthalmology===
In 1849, Stokes invented the Stokes lens to detect astigmatism. It is a lens combination consisted of equal but opposite power cylindrical lenses attached together in such a way so that the lenses can be rotated relative to one another.

===Other work===

In other areas of physics may be mentioned his paper on the conduction of heat in crystals (1851) and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside the outline of a dark body seen against the sky (1882); and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut&#x27;s theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at the surface of the Earth (1849) – Stokes&#x27;s gravity formula—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the &quot;Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures&quot; after the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847.

===Unpublished research===
Many of Stokes&#x27;s discoveries were not published, or were only touched upon in the course of his oral lectures. One such example is his work in the theory of spectroscopy.

In his presidential address to the British Association in 1871, Lord Kelvin stated his belief that the application of the prismatic analysis of light to solar and stellar chemistry had never been suggested directly or indirectly by anyone else when Stokes taught it to him at Cambridge University some time prior to the summer of 1852, and he set forth the conclusions, theoretical and practical, which he learnt from Stokes at that time, and which he afterwards gave regularly in his public lectures at Glasgow. These statements, containing as they do the physical basis on which spectroscopy rests, and the way in which it is applicable to the identification of substances existing in the sun and stars, make it appear that Stokes anticipated Gustav Kirchhoff by at least seven or eight years. Stokes, however, in a letter published some years after the delivery of this address, stated that he had failed to take one essential step in the argument—not perceiving that emission of light of definite wavelength not merely permitted, but necessitated, absorption of light of the same wavelength. He modestly disclaimed &quot;any part of Kirchhoff&#x27;s admirable discovery,&quot; adding that he felt some of his friends had been over-zealous in his cause. It must be said, however, that English men of science have not accepted this disclaimer in all its fullness, and still attribute to Stokes the credit of having first enunciated the fundamental principles of spectroscopy.

In another way, too, Stokes did much for the progress of mathematical physics. Soon after he was elected to the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university with difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society, he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.

====Contributions to engineering====
Stokes was involved in several investigations into railway accidents, especially the Dee Bridge disaster in May 1847, and he served as a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the use of cast iron in railway structures. He contributed to the calculation of the forces exerted by moving engines on bridges. The bridge failed because a cast iron beam was used to support the loads of passing trains. Cast iron is brittle in tension or bending, and many other similar bridges had to be demolished or reinforced.

He appeared as an expert witness at the Tay Bridge disaster, where he gave evidence about the effects of wind loads on the bridge. The centre section of the bridge (known as the High Girders) was completely destroyed during a storm on 28 December 1879, while an express train was in the section, and everyone aboard died (more than 75 victims). The Board of Inquiry listened to many expert witnesses, and concluded that the bridge was &quot;badly designed, badly built and badly maintained&quot;.

As a result of his evidence, he was appointed a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the effect of wind pressure on structures. The effects of high winds on large structures had been neglected at that time, and the commission conducted a series of measurements across Britain to gain an appreciation of wind speeds during storms, and the pressures they exerted on exposed surfaces.

====Work on religion====

Stokes generally held conservative religious values and beliefs. In 1886, he became president of the Victoria Institute, which had been founded to defend evangelical Christian principles against challenges from the new sciences, especially the Darwinian theory of biological evolution. He gave the 1891 Gifford lecture on natural theology. He was also the vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society and was actively involved in doctrinal debates concerning missionary work. However, although his religious views were mostly orthodox, he was unusual among Victorian evangelicals in rejecting eternal punishment in hell, and instead was a proponent of Christian conditionalism.

As President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: &quot;&quot;We all admit that the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that consequently there can be no real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, we must remember that we are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion&quot;.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stokes married Mary Susanna Robinson, the only daughter of Irish astronomer Rev Thomas Romney Robinson, at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh on 4 July 1857. They had five children: Arthur Romney, who inherited the baronetcy; Susanna Elizabeth, who died in infancy; Isabella Lucy (Mrs Laurence Humphry) who contributed the personal memoir of her father in &quot;Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of the Late George Gabriel Stokes, Bart&quot;; Dr William George Gabriel, physician, a troubled man who committed suicide aged 30 while temporarily insane; and Dora Susanna, who died in infancy. His male line and hence his baronetcy have since become extinct.

==Legacy and honours==

*Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University

*In 1869 he presided over the Exeter meeting of the British Association.
*In 1874 he was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
*In 1883 he was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences
*From 1883 to 1885 he was Burnett lecturer at Aberdeen, his lectures on light, which were published in 1884–1887, dealt with its nature, its use as a means of investigation, and its beneficial effects.
*On 18 April 1888 he was admitted as a Freeman of the City of London.
*On 6 July 1889 Queen Victoria made him a Baronet as Sir George Gabriel Stokes of Lensfield Cottage in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom; the title became extinct in 1916.
*In 1889, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society.
*In 1891, as Gifford lecturer, he published a volume on Natural Theology.
*Member of the Prussian Order Pour le Mérite
*His academic distinctions included honorary degrees from many universities, including
**&quot;Doctor mathematicae (honoris causa)&quot; from the Royal Frederick University on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.
*The stokes, a unit of kinematic viscosity, is named after him.
*In 1909, the Stokes Society at Pembroke College was founded as an academic hub for undergraduate scientists across the University. It remains active as of 2023.
*In July 2017, Dublin City University named a building after Stokes in recognition of his contributions to physics and mathematics.

==Publications==
Stokes&#x27;s mathematical and physical papers (see external links) were published in a collected form in five volumes; the first three (Cambridge, 1880, 1883, and 1901) under his own editorship, and the two last (Cambridge, 1904 and 1905) under that of Sir Joseph Larmor, who also selected and arranged the &quot;Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of Stokes&quot; published at Cambridge in 1907.

<text>Cimolodon is a genus of the extinct mammal order of Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and the family Cimolodontidae. Specimens are known from the Late Cretaceous of North America.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Cimolodon&quot; was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889. Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum (2001) noted that &quot;Cimolodon&quot; seems to be more closely related to members of their &quot;Paracimexomys&quot; group than to other ptilodontoideans.

===Species===
&quot;Cimolodon electus&quot; (Fox R.C. 1971) is known from the Upper Cretaceous of the Upper Milk River Formation in Alberta, Canada. Possible finds have been reported from New Mexico.

&quot;Cimolodon nitidus&quot; (Marsh O.C. 1889) is known from Late Cretaceous strata of the Lance Formation of Wyoming, Utah, Montana and South Dakota (United States) as well as Alberta and Saskatchewan (Canada). Synonyms include &quot;Allacodon lentus&quot; (Marsh, 1889); &quot;Allacodon rarus&quot; (Marsh, 1892); &quot;Cimolomys bellus&quot; (Marsh, 1889); &quot;Cimolomys digona&quot; (Marsh, 1899); &quot;Cimolomys nitidus&quot;; &quot;Halodon serratus&quot; (Marsh, 1889); &quot;Nanomyops minitus&quot; (Marsh, 1892); &quot;Nanomys minitus&quot; (Marsh, 1889); and &quot;Ptilodus serratus&quot; (Gidley, 1909). &quot;Cimolodon parvus&quot; (Marsh O.C. 1892) is also known from the Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Wyoming. A specimen referred to as &quot;C.&quot; cf. &quot;nitidus&quot; has been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation.

&quot;Cimolodon similis&quot; (Fox R.C. 1971) is known from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian-early Campanian) of Alberta and Utah. &quot;C. wardi&quot; is known from the Wahweap Formation of Utah.

&quot;Cimolodon akersteni&quot; is known from the Cenomanian-age Wayan Formation of Idaho.

<text>Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger (; 28 February 179914 January 1890), also Doellinger in English, was a German theologian, Catholic priest and church historian who rejected the dogma of papal infallibility. Among his writings which proved controversial, his criticism of the papacy antagonized ultramontanes, yet his reverence for tradition annoyed the liberals.

He is considered an important contributor to the doctrine, growth and development of the Old Catholic Church, though he himself never joined that denomination.

==Early life==
Born at Bamberg, Bavaria, Döllinger came from an intellectual family, his grandfather and father having both been eminent physicians and professors of medical science; his mother&#x27;s family were equally accomplished. Döllinger was first educated in the gymnasium at Würzburg, where he learned Italian. A Benedictine monk taught him English privately. He began to study philosophy at the University of Würzburg, where his father held a professorship. In 1817, he added philology, and, in 1818, turned to theology. He learned Spanish at the university. He particularly devoted himself to church history. In 1820, he became acquainted with Victor Aimé Huber (1800–1869), who was to influence him greatly.

==Career==
After studying at the seminary in Bamberg, on 5 April 1822 he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest for the Diocese of Bamberg, and in November, was appointed chaplain at Markscheinfeldt in Middle Franconia. In 1823 he became professor of church history and canon law in the lyceum at Aschaffenburg. He then took his doctoral degree, and in 1826 became professor of theology at the University of Munich, where he spent the rest of his life. About this time he brought upon himself the criticism of Heinrich Heine, who was then editor of a Munich paper. The unsparing satirist described the professor&#x27;s face as the &quot;gloomiest&quot; in the whole procession of clerics on Good Friday.

In 1836, Döllinger made his first visit to England, and met a number of leading English intellectuals, including John Henry Newman and William Gladstone, with whom he maintained lifelong contact. For many years, a number of young Englishmen boarded with him in Munich; among them was Lord Acton. Acton had been denied entry to the University of Cambridge because he was a Catholic, and subsequently went to Munich where he studied at the University. They became lifelong friends. Döllinger inspired in him a deep love of historical research and its function as a critical instrument.

In 1837, he was made member extraordinary of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences, in 1843 as a regular member, and, from 1860, he was secretary of its historical section. In 1845, Döllinger was made representative of his university in the second chamber of the Bavarian legislature. In 1839, the king had given him a canonry in the royal chapel of St. Cajetan at Munich. On 1 January 1847, he was made mitred provost of that body of canons. However, that same year he was dismissed from his chair, in punishment of his protest as representative of the university on the Bavarian Landtag, to which he had been appointed in 1844, against the dismissal of several university professors.

In 1849, Döllinger was offered the chair of church history. In 1848, when nearly every throne in Europe was shaken by the spread of revolutionary sentiments, he was elected delegate to the national German assembly at Frankfurt. He spoke boldly in favour of freedom for the church to manage her affairs without state interference. In 1857, Döllinger and Acton traveled to Rome, where they were both disenchanted with Pius IX&#x27;s papacy. Döllinger was troubled that the Pope was the head of state of the Papal States. In some speeches at Munich in 1861, he declared his view that the Roman Catholic Church did not need a temporal sovereign. His book on &quot;The Church and the Churches&quot; (Munich, 1861) dealt to a certain extent with the same question. In 1863, he invited 100 theologians to meet at Mechelen and discuss the question which the liberals Lamennais and Lacordaire had raised in France, namely, the attitude that should be assumed by the Roman Catholic Church towards modern ideas. In his address, “On the Past and Future of Catholic Theology,” Döllinger advocated for greater academic freedom.

==Views==
===Protestantism===
On the other hand, Döllinger published a treatise in 1838 against mixed marriages, and in 1843 wrote strongly in favour of requiring Protestant soldiers to kneel at the consecration of the Host when compelled officially to be present at Mass. Moreover, in his works on &quot;The Reformation&quot; (3 volumes Regensburg, 1846–1848) and on &quot;Luther&quot; (1851, Eng, tr., 1853) he severely criticizes Protestant leaders and propagates Ultramontane views. Meanwhile, he had been well received in England; and he afterwards travelled in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, acquainting himself with the condition and prospects of the Roman Catholic Church. His correspondence with leaders of the Tractarian movement in England, beginning in 1842, are preserved. When one of them, James Hope-Scott, converted to Roman Catholicism, Döllinger congratulated him warmly.
===Judaism===
&quot;The Jewish people moved in a circle of religious ideas only part of which were expressed in its sacred literature ... Far from being a dead letter in the hands of a people living in spiritual stagnation, [the Jews] were instinctually endowed with the power and the impulse to develop organically and steadily&quot;, wrote Döllinger. This favorable reference to the vigorous &#x27;spirit&#x27; of Judaism runs counter to common critiques of the religion by 19th century theologians.

==Liberalism==
Early in his professorial career at Munich, Jesuits criticized his manner of teaching of church history. But Adam Möhler defended Döllinger, and they later became friends. Döllinger was in touch with the well-known French Liberal Catholic Lamennais, whose views on the reconciliation of the Roman Catholic Church with the principles of modern society (liberalism) and the French Revolution had aroused much suspicion in Ultramontane circles, which were close to Jesuit. In 1832, Lammenais and his friends Lacordaire and Montalembert, visited Germany, obtaining considerable sympathy in their attempts to bring about a modification of the Roman Catholic attitude to modern problems and liberal political principles.

===Papal authority===

Döllinger&#x27;s stance on the papacy changed in the course of his life. Ultimately, he energetically opposed any addition to, or more stringent definition of, the powers of the pope. He spoke about his convictions, among other places, at a Catholic congress at Mechelen. Pius IX ordered the assembly closed after four days of debate. In response to Döllinger and others, Pius IX issued the famous Syllabus Errorum in 1864, harshly criticizing liberalism and scientism.

===Vatican Council and the Munich conference===

Leading Catholic theologians advised Pius IX to declare Papal infallibility a dogma. There was not, however, universal consensus on the subject. Some bishops, while not opposed, considered its promulgation to be inopportune. The headquarters of the opposition was Germany, and its leader was Döllinger. Among his supporters were his close friends Johann Friedrich and J. N. Huber, in Bavaria. In the rest of Germany, Döllinger was supported by theology professors at Bonn, including the canonist Johann Friedrich von Schulte, Franz Heinrich Reusch, Joseph Langen, Joseph Hubert Reinkens, and other distinguished scholars. In Switzerland, Eduard Herzog and others supported the movement.

Early in 1869, Döllinger&#x27;s &quot;Letters of Janus&quot; (written in conjunction with Huber and Friedrich) began to appear. They were at once translated into English. The disparaged the &quot;Syllabus&quot; and its incompatibility with modern thought. They argued that the concept of papal infallibility was intellectually indefensible, although their interpretation differed from what conservatives had proposed.

During the council, which convened on 8 December 1869, Augustin Theiner, the librarian at the Vatican, not in favor with the pope for his outspoken liberalism, kept his German friends informed of the course of the discussions. The &quot;Letters of Quirinus&quot;, written by Döllinger and Huber concerning the proceedings appeared in the German newspapers, and an English translation was published by Charles Rivington. The proceedings of the council were frequently stormy, and the opponents of the dogma of infallibility complained that they were interrupted, and that endeavours were made to put them down by clamour. The dogma was at length carried by an overwhelming majority, and the dissentient bishops, who – with the exception of two – had left the council before the final division, one by one submitted.

Döllinger headed a protest by forty-four professors in the University of Munich, and gathered together a congress at Munich, which met in August 1870 and issued a declaration adverse to the Vatican decrees. In Bavaria, where Döllinger&#x27;s influence was greatest, a strong determination to resist the resolutions of the council prevailed. But the authority of the council was held by the archbishop of Munich to be paramount, and he called upon Döllinger to submit. Döllinger addressed a memorable letter to the archbishop in 1871, refusing to follow his advice. &quot;As a Christian, as a theologian, as an historian, and as a citizen,&quot; he added, &quot;I cannot accept this doctrine.&quot;

==Excommunication==
On 18 April 1871, Gregor von Scherr, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, excommunicated Döllinger. On 29 February 1871, Döllinger was elected rector-magnificus of the University of Munich by a vote of 54 to six. Several other universities conferred an honorary degree on him: Doctor of Civil Law, University of Oxford, 1871; Doctor of Laws, University of Edinburgh, 1872; Doctor of Law, University of Marburg; Doctor of Philosophy, University of Vienna.

The dissident Bavarian clergy invited Bishop Loos of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, which for more than 150 years had existed independent of the Papacy, to administer the sacrament of Confirmation in Bavaria. The offer was accepted, and the bishop was received with triumphal arches and other demonstrations of joy by a part of the Bavarian Catholics. The three Dutch Old Catholic bishops declared themselves ready to consecrate a &quot;non-infallibilist&quot; bishop for Bavaria, if it were desired. The question was discussed at a meeting of the opponents of the Vatican Council&#x27;s doctrine, and it was resolved to elect a bishop and ask the Dutch Old-Order bishops to consecrate him. Döllinger, however, voted against the proposition, and withdrew from any further steps towards the promotion of this movement.

==The Old Catholic Church==
Döllinger&#x27;s refusal lost Bavaria to the movement; and the number of Bavarian sympathizers was still further reduced when the seceders, in 1878, allowed their priests to marry, a decision which Döllinger, as was known, sincerely regretted. The Old Catholic Communion, however, was formally constituted, with Joseph Hubert Reinkens at its head as bishop, and it still continues to exist in Germany as a whole and, more marginally, in Bavaria.
Döllinger&#x27;s attitude to the new community was not very clearly defined. &quot;I do not wish to join a schismatic society; I am isolated,&quot;. Döllinger&#x27;s regularly insisted, his church remained the ancient Catholic Church, “the one holy catholic and apostolic church.”

==Reunion conferences==
His addresses on the reunion of the churches, delivered at the Bonn Conference of 1872, show that he was by no means hostile towards the newly formed Old Catholic communion, in whose interests these conferences were held. In 1874 and again in 1875, he presided over the reunion conferences held at Bonn and attended by leading ecclesiastics from the British Isles and from the Oriental non-Roman churches, among whom were Bishop Christopher Wordsworth of Lincoln; Bishop Harold Browne of Ely; Lord Plunket, Archbishop of Dublin; Lycurgus, Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syros and Tenos; Canon Liddon; and the Russian Orthodox professor Ossmnine of Saint Petersburg. At the latter of these two conferences, when Döllinger was 76 years of age, he delivered a series of addresses in German and English in which he discussed the state of theology on the continent, the reunion question and the religious condition of the various countries of Europe in which the Roman Catholic Church held sway. Not the least of his achievements on this occasion was the successful attempt, made with extraordinary tact, ability, knowledge and perseverance, to induce the Orientals, Anglicans and Old Catholics present to accept a formula of concord drawn from the writings of the leading theologians of the Greek Church on the long-vexed question of the procession of the Holy Spirit.

==Scholarship in retirement==
This result having been attained, he passed the rest of his days in retirement, emerging sometimes from his retreat to give addresses on theological questions, and also writing, in conjunction with his friend Reusch, his last book, &quot;Geschichte der Moralstreitigkeiten in der römisch-katholischen Kirche seit dem sechszehnten Jahrhundert mit Beiträgen zur Geschichte und Charakteristik des Jesuitenordens&quot; (Nördlingen, 1889), in which he deals with the moral theology of Alphonsus Liguori. He died in Munich at the age of ninety-one. Even &quot;in&quot; &quot;articulo mortis&quot; he refused to receive the sacraments from the parish priest at the cost of submission, but the last offices were performed by his friend Professor Friedrich. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.
