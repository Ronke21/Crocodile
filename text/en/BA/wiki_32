<text>Claudia Alta &quot;Lady Bird&quot; Johnson (; December 22, 1912 – July 11, 2007) was an American woman who served as the first lady of the United States from 1963 to 1969 as the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson. She had previously served as second lady from 1961 to 1963 when her husband was vice president under John F. Kennedy.

Notably well educated for a woman of her era, Lady Bird proved a capable manager and a successful investor. After marrying Lyndon Johnson in 1934 when he was a political hopeful in Austin, Texas, she used a modest inheritance to bankroll his congressional campaign and then ran his office while he served in the Navy.

As first lady, Johnson broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress, employing her press secretary, and making a solo electioneering tour. She advocated beautifying the nation&#x27;s cities and highways (&quot;Where flowers bloom, so does hope&quot;). The Highway Beautification Act was informally known as &quot;Lady Bird&#x27;s Bill&quot;. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1984, the highest honors bestowed upon a U.S. civilian. Johnson has been consistently ranked in occasional Siena College Research Institute surveys as one of the most highly regarded American first ladies per historians&#x27; assessments.

==Early life==

Claudia Alta Taylor was born on December 22, 1912, in Karnack, Texas, a town in Harrison County, near the eastern state line with Louisiana. Her birthplace was &quot;The Brick House&quot;, an antebellum plantation house on the outskirts of town, which her father had purchased shortly before her birth. She was a descendant of English Protestant martyr Rowland Taylor through his grandson Captain Thomas J. Taylor II.

She was named for her mother&#x27;s brother Claud. 
During her infancy, her nursemaid, Alice Tittle, 
said that she was as &quot;pretty as a ladybird&quot;.
Opinions differ about whether the name refers to a bird or a ladybird beetle, the latter of which is commonly referred to as a &quot;ladybug&quot; in North America. The nickname virtually replaced her first name for the rest of her life. Her father and siblings called her Lady, and her husband called her Bird—the name she used on her marriage license. During her teenage years, some classmates would call her Bird to provoke her since she reportedly was not fond of the name.

Nearly all of her maternal and paternal immigrant ancestors arrived in the Virginia Colony during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, likely as indentured servants as were most early settlers in the colony. Her father, a native of Alabama, had primarily English ancestry and some Welsh and Danish. Her mother, also a native of Alabama, was of English and Scottish descent.

Her father, Thomas Jefferson Jonson Taylor (August 29, 1874 – October 22, 1960), was a sharecropper&#x27;s son. He became a wealthy businessman and owned of cotton and two general stores. &quot;My father was a very strong character, to put it mildly&quot;, his daughter once said. &quot;He lived by his own rules. It was a whole feudal way of life, really.&quot;

Her mother, born Minnie Lee Pattillo (1874–1918), loved opera and felt out of place in Karnack; she was often in &quot;poor emotional and physical health&quot;. When Lady Bird was five years old, Minnie fell down a flight of stairs while pregnant. She died of complications of miscarriage in 1918. In a profile of Lady Bird Johnson, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Lady Bird&#x27;s mother as &quot;a tall, eccentric woman from an old and aristocratic Alabama family, [who] liked to wear long white dresses and heavy veils [...] fussed over food fads, played grand opera endlessly on the phonograph, loved to read the classics aloud to tiny Lady Bird [... and who] scandalized people for miles around by entertaining Negroes in her home, and once even started to write a book about Negro religious practices, called Bio Baptism.&quot; Her husband, however, tended to see black people as nothing more than &quot;hewers of wood and drawers of water&quot;, according to his younger son Anthony.

Lady Bird had two elder brothers, Thomas Jefferson Jr. (1901–1959) and Antonio, also known as Tony (1904–1986). Her widowed father married twice more. His second wife was Beulah Taylor, a bookkeeper at a general store. His third wife was Ruth Scroggins, whom he married in 1937.

Lady Bird was largely raised by her maternal aunt Effie Pattillo, who moved to Karnack after her sister&#x27;s death. She also visited her Pattillo relatives in Autauga County, Alabama, every summer until she was a young woman. As she explained, &quot;Until I was about 20, summertime always meant Alabama to me. With Aunt Effie, we would board the train in Marshall and ride to the part of the world that meant watermelon cuttings, picnics at the creek, and a lot of company every Sunday.&quot; According to Lady Bird, her Aunt Effie &quot;opened my spirit to beauty, but she neglected to give me any insight into the practical matters a girl should know about, such as how to dress or choose one&#x27;s friends or learning to dance.&quot;

Lady Bird was a shy and quiet girl who spent much of her youth alone outdoors. &quot;People always look back at it now and assume it was lonely,&quot; she once said about her childhood. &quot;To me it definitely was not. ... I spent a lot of time just walking and fishing and swimming.&quot; She developed her lifelong love of the outdoors as a child growing up in the tall pines and bayous of East Texas, where she watched the wildflowers bloom each spring.

==Education==

When it came time to enter high school, Lady Bird had to move away and live with another family during weekdays in the town of Jefferson, Texas, since there was no high school in the Karnack area. (Her brothers were sent to boarding schools in New York.) She graduated third in her class at the age of 15 from Marshall Senior High School in the nearby county seat. Despite her young age, her father gave her a car so that she could drive herself to school, a distance of each way. She said of that time, &quot;[I]t was an awful chore for my daddy to delegate some person from his business to take me in and out.&quot; During her senior year, when she realized that she had the highest grades in her class, she &quot;purposely allowed her grades to slip&quot; so that she would not have to give the valedictorian or salutatorian speech.

After graduating from high school in May 1928, Lady Bird entered the University of Alabama for the summer session, where she took her first journalism course. But, homesick for Texas, she stayed home and did not return for the fall term at Alabama. Instead, she and a high school friend enrolled at St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal College for Women, an Episcopal boarding junior college for women in Dallas. It influenced her to &quot;convert to the Episcopal faith&quot;, although she waited five years for confirmation.

After graduating from St. Mary&#x27;s in May 1930, Lady Bird toyed with returning to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall was going to the University of Texas, so she chartered a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly fell in love with the city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, including Texas Orange Jackets, a women&#x27;s honorary service organization, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.

The summer after her second graduation, she and a girlfriend traveled to New York City and Washington, where they peered through the fence at the White House. Dallek described Lady Bird as having undergone a boost in her self-confidence through her years at the college. Her time there marked a departure from her timid behavior in her youth.

==Marriage and family==
A friend in Austin introduced her to Lyndon B. Johnson, a 26-year-old Congressional aide with political aspirations, working for Congressman Richard Kleberg. Lady Bird recalled having felt &quot;like a moth drawn to a flame&quot;. Biographer Randall B. Woods attributed Johnson&#x27;s &quot;neglect of his legal studies&quot; to his courting of Lady Bird.

On their first date, at the Driskill Hotel, Lyndon proposed. Lady Bird did not want to rush into marriage, but he was persistent and did not want to wait. Ten weeks later, Lady Bird accepted his proposal. The couple married on November 17, 1934, at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in San Antonio, Texas.

After she suffered three miscarriages, the couple had two daughters together: Lynda Bird (born 1944) and Luci Baines (born 1947). The couple and their two daughters all shared the initials LBJ. Their daughters lived in the White House during their teenage years, under media scrutiny.

Lynda Bird married Charles S. Robb in a White House ceremony. He was later elected governor of Virginia and U.S. Senator. Luci Baines married Pat Nugent in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and, later, Ian Turpin. Lady Bird had seven grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren at the time of her death.

Their marriage, however, suffered due to Lyndon&#x27;s numerous affairs—in particular, the relationship between Lyndon and socialite Alice Marsh. This relationship was on and off between 1939 and the early years of his presidency and was eventually ended due to Marsh&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War. Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s awareness of these infidelities was included in her 2007 obituary, noting that Lady Bird &quot;was openly humiliated&quot;. Her husband would even brag that he had slept with more women than his predecessor, John F. Kennedy.

==Early politics==
When Lyndon decided to run for Congress from Austin&#x27;s 10th district, Lady Bird provided the money to launch his campaign. She took $10,000 of her inheritance from her mother&#x27;s estate to help start his political career. The couple settled in Washington, D.C., after Lyndon was elected to Congress. After he enlisted in the Navy at the outset of the Second World War, Lady Bird ran his congressional office.

Lady Bird sometimes served as a mediating force between her wilful husband and those he encountered. On one occasion after Lyndon had clashed with Dan Rather, then a young Houston reporter, Lady Bird followed Rather in her car. Stopping him, she invited him to return and have some punch, explaining, &quot;That&#x27;s just the way Lyndon sometimes is.&quot;

During the years of the Johnson presidency, Lyndon, in one incident, yelled at the White House photographer who failed to show up for a photo shoot with the First Lady. She consoled the photographer afterward, who said that, despite his feelings against President Johnson, he &quot;would walk over hot coals for Lady Bird.&quot;

==Business career==
In January–February 1943, during World War II, Lady Bird Johnson spent $17,500 of her inheritance to purchase KTBC, an Austin radio station. She bought the radio station from a three-man partnership that included Robert B. Anderson, a future U.S. secretary of the navy and U.S. secretary of the treasury, and Texas oilman and rancher Wesley West.

She served as president of the LBJ Holding Co., and her husband negotiated an agreement with the CBS radio network. Despite Lyndon&#x27;s objections, Lady Bird expanded by buying a television station in 1952. She reminded him that she could do as she wished with her inheritance. The station, KTBC-TV/7 (then affiliated with CBS as well), was Austin&#x27;s monopoly VHF franchise and generated revenues that made the Johnsons millionaires. Over the years, journalists have revealed that Lyndon used his influence in the Senate to influence the Federal Communications Commission into granting the monopoly license, which was in Lady Bird&#x27;s name.

LBJ Holding also had two small banks; they failed and were closed in 1991 by the FDIC. But the core Johnson radio properties survived and prospered. Emmis Communications bought KLBJ-AM, KLBJ-FM, KGSR, and three other stations from LBJ Holding in 2003 for $105 million.

Eventually, Lady Bird&#x27;s initial $41,000 investment turned into more than $150 million for the LBJ Holding Company. She was the first president&#x27;s wife to have become a millionaire in her own right before her husband was elected to office. She remained involved with the company until she was in her eighties.

==Second Lady of the United States==

John F. Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson as his running mate for the 1960 election. At Kennedy&#x27;s request, Lady Bird took an expanded role during the campaign, as his wife Jacqueline was pregnant with their second child. Over 71 days, Lady Bird traveled through 11 states and appeared at 150 events. Kennedy and Johnson won the election that November, with Lady Bird helping the Democratic ticket carry seven Southern states.

Reflecting later, Lady Bird said that the years her husband served as vice president and she as Second Lady were &quot;a very different period of our lives.&quot; Nationally, the two had a kind of celebrity, but they both found the office of vice president to lack power.

As the vice president&#x27;s wife, Lady Bird often served as a substitute for Jacqueline Kennedy at official events and functions. Within her first year as Second Lady, she had substituted for Mrs. Kennedy at more than 50 events, roughly one per week. This experience prepared Lady Bird for the following challenges of her unexpected years as First Lady.

On November 22, 1963, the Johnsons were accompanying the Kennedys in Dallas when President Kennedy was assassinated; they were two cars behind the President in his motorcade. Lyndon was sworn in as president on Air Force One two hours after Kennedy died, with Lady Bird and Jacqueline Kennedy by his side. Afterward, Lady Bird created a tape on which she recorded her memories of the assassination, saying it was &quot;primarily as a form of therapy to help me over the shock and horror of the experience.&quot; She submitted a transcript of the tape to the Warren Commission as testimony. LBJ advisor Abe Fortas had made notations on her document to add detail. In their plans for their trip to Texas, the Johnsons had intended to entertain the Kennedys that night at their ranch.

In the days following the assassination, Lady Bird worked with Jacqueline Kennedy on the transition of her husband to the White House. While having great respect for Jacqueline and finding her strong in the aftermath of the murder, Lady Bird believed from the start of her tenure as first lady that she would be unfavorably compared to her immediate predecessor. On her last day in the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy left Lady Bird a note in which she promised she would &quot;be happy&quot; there.

==First Lady of the United States==
As first lady and trusted presidential confidant, Lady Bird Johnson helped establish the public environmental movement in the 1960s. She worked to beautify Washington, D.C., by planting thousands of flowers, set up the White House Natural Beauty Conference, and lobbied Congress for the president&#x27;s full range of environmental initiatives. In 1965, she took the lead in calling for passage of the Highway Beautification Act. The act called for control of outdoor advertising, including removal of certain types of signs, along the nation&#x27;s growing Interstate Highway System and the existing federal-aid primary highway system. It also required certain junkyards along Interstate or primary highways to be removed or screened and encouraged scenic enhancement and roadside development. According to Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, she single-handedly, &quot;influenced the president to demand-and support-more far-sighted conservation legislation.&quot;

Her capital beautification project turned the national capital into a showcase for the nation. It was intended to improve physical conditions in Washington, D.C., for residents and tourists by planting millions of flowers, many of them on National Park Service land along roadways around the capital. She said, &quot;Where flowers bloom, so does hope.&quot;

She worked extensively with the American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) executive Vice President Robert F. Lederer to protect wildflowers and promoted planting them along highways. Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She became the first president&#x27;s wife to advocate actively for legislation when she was instrumental in promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which was nicknamed &quot;Lady Bird&#x27;s Bill&quot;. It was developed to beautify the nation&#x27;s highway system by limiting billboards and by planting roadside areas. She was also an advocate of the Head Start program to give children from lower-income families a step up in school readiness.

Lady Bird created the modern structure of the First Lady&#x27;s office: she was the first in this role to have a press secretary and chief of staff of her own, and an outside liaison with Congress. Her press secretary from 1963 to 1969 was Liz Carpenter, a fellow alumna of the University of Texas. As a mark of changing times, Carpenter was the first professional newswoman to become press secretary to a First Lady; she also served as Lady Bird&#x27;s staff director. Lady Bird&#x27;s tenure as First Lady marked the beginning of hiring employees in the East Wing to work specifically on the First Lady&#x27;s projects.

President Johnson had initially said he would turn down the Democratic Party nomination for president in 1964, having been unhappy during his service in President Kennedy&#x27;s administration and believing the party did not want him. Although aides could not sway him, the First Lady convinced him otherwise, reassuring him of his worthiness and saying that if he dropped out, the Republicans would likely take the White House.

During the 1964 campaign, Lady Bird traveled through eight Southern states from October 6 to 9 in a chartered train, the &quot;Lady Bird Special&quot;, at one point giving 45 speeches over four days. It was the first solo whistle-stop tour by a First Lady. In the same month, Lady Bird continued her campaign tour by airplane, with stops in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana, and Kentucky.

In the November 1964 presidential election, Johnson won a landslide victory over his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater. At the ceremony to swear in the new president, Lady Bird held the Bible as her husband took the oath of office on January 20, 1965, starting a tradition which continues.

On September 22, 1965, Lady Bird dedicated a Peoria, Illinois, landscape plaza, with the president of the Peoria City Beautification Association, Leslie Kenyon, saying during the ceremony that Lady Bird was the first presidential spouse &quot;who has visited our city as an official guest in our 140 years of existence.&quot;

On September 22, 1966, Lady Bird dedicated the Glen Canyon Dam in northern Arizona, fulfilling a goal that both presidents Kennedy and Johnson had sought to accomplish. She said the dam belonged to all Americans amid an increasing concern for water that affected every American &quot;no matter whether he lives in New York or Page, Arizona.&quot;

In late-August 1967, Lady Bird traveled to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to attend the Expo 67, a White House aide saying she had been urged by the President to travel there since his own trip three months prior.

In mid-September 1967, Lady Bird began touring the Midwestern United States as part of a trip that one White House described as &quot;mostly agriculture during the day and culture at night.&quot; President Johnson was then declining in support by farmers, months before a planned re-election bid. Speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on September 20, Lady Bird said problems within American cities were creating crime.

In January 1968 at a White House luncheon, Eartha Kitt, when asked by the first lady what her views were on the Vietnam War, replied: &quot;You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.&quot; Kitt&#x27;s anti-war remarks reportedly angered Lyndon and Mrs. Johnson, and this resulted in the derailment of Kitt&#x27;s professional career.

Toward the end of Johnson&#x27;s first term, Lady Bird was anxious for her husband to leave office. In September 1967, Lady Bird voiced her concerns that a second term would be detrimental to his health. Health concerns may have been one of the reasons why President Johnson decided not to seek re-election.

In 1970, Lady Bird published &quot;A White House Diary&quot;, her intimate, behind-the-scenes account of her husband&#x27;s presidency spanning November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969. Beginning with President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, she recorded the momentous events of her times, including the Great Society&#x27;s War on Poverty; the national civil rights and social protest movements; her activism on behalf of the environment; and the Vietnam War.

Johnson was acquainted with a long span of fellow first ladies, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Laura Bush. She was protected by the United States Secret Service for 44 years.

Biographer Betty Boyd Caroli said in 2015 of Johnson that

She really invented the job of the modern first lady. She was the first one to have a big staff, the first one to have a comprehensive program in her own name, the first one to write a book about the White House years, when she leaves. She had an important role in setting up an enduring role for her husband with the LBJ Library. She&#x27;s the first one to campaign extensively on her own for her husband.

Writing in 1986, William H. Inman observed that Johnson was considered by some &quot;the most effective First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt&quot;, citing her battles against highway billboard forests, auto heaps, and junk piles as well as her support for American public landscapes maintaining beauty and sanity.

==Later life==

Former president Johnson died of a heart attack in 1973, four years after leaving office. When he suffered the heart attack, Lady Bird was in a meeting, and the former president had died when she reached him. She arranged for the body to lie in state at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library and Museum the following day, and the body was laid to rest two days later. The couple&#x27;s elder daughter, Lynda, said that God &quot;knew what he was doing&quot; when her father died ahead of her mother; she thought her father would not have been able to live without Lady Bird.
After his death, Lady Bird took time to travel and spent more time with her daughters. She remained in the public eye, honoring her husband and other presidents. She entertained the wives of governors at the LBJ Presidential Library.

In the 1970s, Johnson focused her attention on the Austin riverfront area through her involvement in the Town Lake Beautification Project. From 1971 to 1978, she served on the board of regents for the University of Texas System. She also served on the National Park Service Advisory Board, and was the first woman to serve on National Geographic Society&#x27;s board of trustees. President Nixon mentioned her as a possible ambassador in a circulated memo, but never nominated her for office.

In December 1973, after President Nixon established the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac, he notified Johnson via a telephone call.

In August 1975, after First Lady Betty Ford made comments on sex, Johnson expressed sympathy: &quot;I know the pressures of being a First Lady, and I think maybe she got asked one question too quick.&quot;

During the 1976 United States presidential election, Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter apologized to Johnson over comments he made about her husband during an interview in which he stated he would not follow trends of &quot;lying, cheating, and distorting the truth&quot; set forth by former Presidents Nixon and Johnson.

In November 1977, Johnson spoke at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference among other speakers including Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, Bella Abzug, Barbara Jordan, Cecilia Burciaga, Gloria Steinem, Lenore Hershey and Jean O&#x27;Leary.

On March 12, 1980, Johnson returned to the White House and attended a reception commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the Head Start program. In his remarks, President Carter expressed gratitude for her attending as he stated &quot;she personifies too, as you know, the essence of what this great man did with those who worked around him&quot;, referring to her late husband.

In June 1981, officials of Dartmouth College stated that Johnson and former president Gerald Ford would serve as co-chairs of the fundraising committee for the Rockefeller Center for the Social Sciences. Johnson later attended the dedication of the center in September 1983.

In 1982, Johnson and actress Helen Hayes founded the National Wildflower Research Center west of Austin, Texas, as a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving and reintroducing native plants in planned landscapes. In 1994, the center opened a new facility southwest of Austin; they officially renamed it the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1995 in acknowledgment of her having raised $10 million for the facility. In 2006, the center was incorporated into the University of Texas at Austin.

In 1988, Johnson convened with three other former first ladies—Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, and Pat Nixon—at the &quot;Women and the Constitution&quot; conference at The Carter Center to assess that document&#x27;s impact on women. The conference featured over 150 speakers and 1,500 attendees from all 50 states and 10 foreign countries. The conference was meant to promote awareness on sexual inequality in other countries, and fight against it in America.In September 1991, Johnson unveiled a new line of English porcelain flower sculpture that drew influence from American wildflowers in the Corrigan&#x27;s Jewelry at NorthPark Center in Dallas.

For 20 years, Johnson spent her summers on the Massachusetts island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, renting the home of Charles Guggenheim for many of those years. She said she had greatly appreciated the island&#x27;s natural beauty and flowers.

In August 1984, Johnson publicly stated her support for the vice-presidential nomination of Geraldine Ferraro in that year&#x27;s presidential election while admitting the difficulty the Mondale-Ferraro ticket faced in winning Texas.

Johnson returned to the White House for the twenty-fifth-anniversary celebration of her husband&#x27;s inauguration on April 6, 1990. Incumbent president George H. W. Bush praised her for her support of her husband and work toward beautifying landscapes.

On October 13, 2006, Johnson made a rare public appearance at the renovation announcement of the LBJ Library and Museum.

===Health problems and death===

In 1986, 13 years after her husband&#x27;s death, Johnson&#x27;s health began to fail. She suffered her first fainting spell that year while attending a funeral, and entered St. David&#x27;s Community Hospital for observation. She also injured her left knee in a fall the day before her hospitalization. In August 1993, she suffered a stroke and became legally blind due to macular degeneration. In 1999, she was hospitalized for a second fainting spell. In 2002, she suffered a second, more severe, stroke, which prevented her from speaking normally or walking without assistance. In 2005, she spent a few days in an Austin hospital for treatment of bronchitis. In February 2006, Lynda Johnson Robb told a gathering at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, that her mother was totally blind and was &quot;not in very good health&quot;. In June 2007, she spent six days in Seton Hospital in Austin after suffering from a low-grade fever.

Lady Bird Johnson died at home on July 11, 2007, at 4:18 p.m. (CDT) from natural causes at the age of 94, attended by family members and Catholic priest Father Robert Scott.

At the funeral service, her daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, gave a eulogy, saying, &quot;A few weeks before Mother died, I was taking visiting relatives to the extraordinary Blanton Art Museum ... Mother was on IV antibiotics, a feeding tube, and oxygen, but she wasn&#x27;t gonna let little things like that deter her from discovering another great art museum. What a picture we were—literally rolling through the museum like a mobile hospital.&quot;

Three weeks before Johnson&#x27;s death, the rector of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Fredericksburg, her second home for over 50 years, had announced to his parishioners that she had given $300,000 to pay off the church&#x27;s mortgage.

Johnson&#x27;s funeral was a public event. On July 15, 2007, a ceremonial cortège left the Texas State Capitol. The public was invited to line the route through downtown Austin on Congress Avenue and along the shores of Lady Bird Lake to pay their respects. The public part of the funeral procession ended in Johnson City. The family had a private burial at the Johnson family cemetery in Stonewall, where she is buried next to her husband, who had died 34 years earlier. Unlike previous funerals for first ladies, the pallbearers came from members of the armed forces.

==Historical assessments==
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Johnson has ranked among the seven-most highly regarded first ladies in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Johnson has been ranked:
*3rd-best of 42 in 1982
*6th-best of 37 in 1993
*7th-best of 38 in 2003
*5th-best of 38 in 2008
*7th-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2008 Siena Research Institute survey, Johnson was ranked in the top five for six out of the ten criteria, ranking the 5th highest in background, 5th highest in intelligence, 5th highest in value to the country, 5th highest in integrity, 4th highest in her accomplishments, and 5th highest in leadership. In additional questions asked in the 2014 survey, among 20th- and 21st-century American first ladies, historians assessed Johnson as the 5th easiest to imagine serving as president herself, having had the 5th-greatest public service after leaving the White House, and having been the 5th best in creating a lasting legacy. In the 2014 survey, Johnson and her husband were also ranked the 10th highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

==Honors==
On August 27, 1969, President Richard Nixon dedicated a grove of redwood trees as the &quot;Lady Bird Johnson Grove&quot; due to her efforts as First Lady toward preserving national resources for Americans. The grove is located just north of Orick, California, and is part of Redwood National Park. Lady Bird attended the dedication with former President Johnson.

Lady Bird Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford on January 10, 1977. The citation for her medal read:

One of America&#x27;s great First Ladies, she claimed her own place in the hearts and history of the American people. In councils of power or in homes of the poor, she made government human with her unique compassion and her grace, warmth and wisdom. Her leadership transformed the American landscape and preserved its natural beauty as a national treasure.

She received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1988, becoming the first wife of a president to receive the honor. In a 1982 poll taken of historians ranking the most influential and important First Ladies, Lady Bird was ranked third—behind Abigail Adams and Eleanor Roosevelt—primarily for her work as a conservation activist.

In 1995, the National Wildflower Research Center, near Austin, Texas, was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. She and actress Helen Hayes founded the center in 1982.

In 1966, she was awarded the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal for Services to Humanity.

In 1995, Lady Bird received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In November 1968, Columbia Island, in Washington, D.C., was renamed Lady Bird Johnson Park in honor of her campaign as first lady to beautify the capital. In 1976, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated on Columbia Island.

Lady Bird declined many overtures to name Austin&#x27;s Town Lake in her honor after she had led a campaign to clean up the lake and add trails to its shoreline; following her death, Austin Mayor Will Wynn&#x27;s office said it was a &quot;foregone conclusion that Town Lake is going to be renamed&quot; in honor of Lady Bird Johnson. The lake was renamed Lady Bird Lake on July 26, 2007.

In April 2008, the &quot;Lady Bird Johnson Memorial Cherry Blossom Grove&quot; was dedicated to Marshfield, Missouri. The dedication took place during the city&#x27;s annual cherry blossom festival. Johnson had supported the rural community and their initiative to plant ornamental cherry trees.

In 1995, she received an Honor Award from the National Building Museum for her lifetime leadership in beautification and conservation campaigns. She was also named the honorary chairwoman of the Head Start program.

Lady Bird held honorary degrees from many universities: Boston University; the University of Alabama; George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University; State University of New York; Southern Methodist University; Texas Woman&#x27;s University; Middlebury College; Williams College, Southwestern University; Texas State University–San Marcos; Washington College; and St. Edward&#x27;s University.

On June 7, 2008, Texas honored Lady Bird by renaming the state convention&#x27;s Blue Star Breakfast as the &#x27;Lady Bird Breakfast&#x27;. In January 2009, St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin completed a new residence hall for upperclassmen bearing the name of Lady Bird Johnson Hall, or &quot;LBJ Hall&quot; for short.

On August 28, 2008, Lady Bird Johnson High School was opened in her name in San Antonio, Texas, a part of the North East Independent School District.

On October 22, 2012, the United States Postal Service announced the issue of a souvenir Forever stamp sheet honoring Lady Bird Johnson as a tribute to her legacy of beautifying the nation&#x27;s roadsides, urban parks and trails. Five of the six stamps feature adaptations of stamps originally issued in the 1960s to promote planting in public spaces. The sixth stamp features her official White House portrait, a painting of the First Lady in a yellow gown, by Elizabeth Shoumatoff. The stamps were dedicated on November 30, 2012, at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center of The University of Texas at Austin.

In 2013, Lady Bird was posthumously awarded the prestigious Rachel Carson Award. The award, presented by Audubon&#x27;s Women in Conservation, was accepted by her daughter Lynda.

<doc id="216426" wikidata="Q1065704" url="?curid=216426" title="C. Y. O'Connor">
<text>Charles Yelverton O&#x27;Connor, (11 January 1843 – 10 March 1902), was an Irish engineer who is best known for his work in Western Australia, especially the construction of Fremantle Harbour, thought to be impossible, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Connor was born in Gravelmount House, a small country house in Castletown Kilpatrick, a parish located between Kells and Ardee in the north of County Meath in Ireland. He was the third and youngest son and fourth child of John O&#x27;Connor, a farmer and company secretary, and his wife Mary Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Keefe. O&#x27;Connor was home-schooled by his aunt before being educated at Waterford Endowed School (also
known as Bishop Foy&#x27;s School). In 1859 he was apprenticed to John Chaloner Smith as a railway engineer. At the age of 21 he emigrated to New Zealand, and on 6 September 1866 was appointed assistant engineer for Canterbury Province under Edward Dobson.

His first task was the construction of the Otira Gorge section of the road over Arthur&#x27;s Pass, so that the gold fields on the West Coast became easier to access. After holding other positions, O&#x27;Connor became inspecting engineer for the mid-South Island. In 1873 he married Scottish-born Susan Laetitia Ness, and they had eight children, four girls (including Girl Guiding commissioner Bridget Yelverton Lee Steere and painter Kathleen O&#x27;Connor) and four boys while in New Zealand (their fifth child, Charles Goring Yelverton O&#x27;Connor, died aged 7 months in a home accident). In 1883 O&#x27;Connor was appointed Under-Secretary of Public Works in New Zealand, and in 1890 he was appointed Marine Engineer for the colony.

By 1891, O&#x27;Connor had much experience in harbour and dock construction when he resigned his position in April that year to become Engineer-in-Chief of Western Australia. His wife and children relocated with him to Australia. There he was responsible for the construction of Fremantle Harbour and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme project, which supplied water to the Eastern Goldfields. He was the inaugural Engineer in Chief of the Public Works Department.

==Fremantle Harbour==

The construction of Fremantle Harbour was probably O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s greatest personal triumph, as his proposal to build the harbour within the entrance to the Swan River was contrary to previous expert advice that this was impracticable and that the construction would require constant dredging. Work commenced in 1892 in removing a limestone bar and sand shoals at the mouth of the Swan River and was successfully completed in 1903. On 4 May 1897 the first ocean-going steamer, the &quot;Sultan&quot;, berthed at South Quay (renamed Victoria Quay on 26 July 1901 in honour of the late Queen Victoria). At age 54, O&#x27;Connor travelled to London to be inducted a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

More than 100 years of continued use of Fremantle Harbour by heavy shipping has erased all doubt concerning O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s technical judgement.

==Railways==
O&#x27;Connor was engineer-in-chief and acting general manager of railways in Western Australia. Upgrades of existing lines and plans for new lines were made. The search for water for the Northam-Southern Cross route was initiated by O&#x27;Connor. He was in charge of the railway.

==Goldfields Water Supply Scheme==
O&#x27;Connor is best known for his work on the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, also known as the &quot;Goldfields Pipeline&quot;. The pipeline carries water from Perth to Kalgoorlie. A succession of gold rushes at Southern Cross in 1887, at Coolgardie in 1892, and at Kalgoorlie in 1893 caused a population explosion in the barren and dry desert centre of Western Australia, exemplified by towns like Cunderdin and Merredin. On 16 July 1896, John Forrest introduced to Western Australian Parliament a bill to authorise the raising of a loan of £2.5 million to construct the scheme: the pipeline would pump of water per day to the Goldfields from a dam on the Helena River near Mundaring Weir in Perth, pumped in eight successive stages through 330 miles of pipe to the Mount Charlotte Reservoir in Kalgoorlie. The water is then reticulated to various mining centres in the Goldfields.

The lake created by Mundaring Weir is now known as &quot;Lake O&#x27;Connor&quot;, and still provides drinking water for the towns along the pipeline to Kalgoorlie.

==Death==

O&#x27;Connor was subjected to prolonged criticism by members of the press and also many members of the Western Australian Parliament over the scheme. John Forrest, always a supporter, had left Western Australian politics to become federal defence minister. Defamatory attacks by the press had wounded O&#x27;Connor.

Evans describes how political machinations and individual greed led to many libellous newspaper articles about O&#x27;Connor towards the end of the pipeline project. One article in particular in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, 9 February 1902, by its editor, Thomas Walker, continuing a campaign against O&#x27;Connor by Walker&#x27;s deceased predecessor Frederick Vosper, is thought to have contributed to his death. Accusing O&#x27;Connor of corruption, it read, in part:

The government conducted an inquiry into the scheme and found no basis for the press accusations of corruption or misdemeanours on the part of O&#x27;Connor. Thomas Walker claimed vindication as the Royal Commission into the Coolgardie Water Scheme found &quot;of the degree to which his [O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s] implicit trust had been misplaced [in Thomas C. Hodgson, the Engineer in Charge of the Coolgardie Water Scheme]... unbalanced an already overstrained mind&quot;.

It is claimed that local Noongar Aboriginal people, unhappy with his destruction of the limestone bar across the Swan River at Point Walter, placed a curse on O&#x27;Connor. and that &quot;... they sang him to make him crazy&quot;, and his suicide was the result. O&#x27;Connor took his own life on 10 March 1902 by shooting himself at the water&#x27;s edge after riding his horse to Robb Jetty, south of Fremantle. Less than a year later, Forrest officially commissioned the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme.

==Legacy==

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s greatest legacies are the Fremantle Inner Harbour and the Goldfields Water supply Scheme, which ranks as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest engineering achievements.

The beach where O&#x27;Connor died was named after him and there is also a statue sculpted by Tony Jones, of him in the water there.

The Monument to C. Y. O&#x27;Connor was built in 1911 and was designed by Pietro Porcelli.

The novel &quot;The Drowner&quot; by Robert Drewe provides a fictionalised account of O&#x27;Connor and the building of the pipeline.

On 7 December 1898, his daughter Eva married Sir George Julius at St John&#x27;s Church, Fremantle. Julius was the first chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) which later became the CSIRO.

His daughter Kathleen O&#x27;Connor was a successful and respected painter.

The C. Y. O&#x27;Connor College of TAFE in Western Australia bears his in name.

The Division of O&#x27;Connor, named after O&#x27;Connor, is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Western Australia. Originally it encircled the area around Perth, from Geraldton on the Indian Ocean coast to Albany on the Southern Ocean coast. The electoral boundary was changed dramatically in 2008 (taking effect in 2010) and it now includes the Southern Wheatbelt and most of the Goldfields of Western Australia.

A bronze statue of O&#x27;Connor by Pietro Porcelli stands in front of the Fremantle Port Authority buildings, commemorating O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s achievements.
O&#x27;Connor has also had a school named after him called O&#x27;Connor Primary School, in Kalgoorlie-Boulder.

A song called &#x27;C.Y. O&#x27;Connor&#x27; by a local Irish band based in Western Australian named The Healys was written in memory of the Irish Engineer.

<doc id="216428" wikidata="Q199182" url="?curid=216428" title="Ornamental plant">
<text>Ornamental plants or &quot;garden plants&quot; are plants that are primarily grown for their beauty but also for qualities such as scent or how they shape physical space. Many flowering plants and garden varieties tend to be specially bred cultivars that improve on the original species in qualities such as color, shape, scent, and long-lasting blooms. There are many examples of fine ornamental plants that can provide height, privacy, and beauty for any garden. These ornamental perennial plants have seeds that allow them to reproduce. One of the beauties of ornamental grasses is that they are very versatile and low maintenance. 

Almost all types of plant have ornamental varieties: trees, shrubs, climbers, grasses, succulents, aquatic plants, herbaceous perennials and annual plants. Non-botanical classifications include houseplants, bedding plants, hedges, plants for cut flowers and &quot;foliage plants&quot;. The cultivation of ornamental plants comes under floriculture and tree nurseries, which is a major branch of horticulture.
Commonly, ornamental garden plants are grown for the display of aesthetic features including flowers, leaves, scent, overall foliage texture, fruit, stem and bark, and aesthetic form. In some cases, unusual features may be considered to be of interest, such as the prominent thorns of &quot;Rosa sericea&quot; and &quot;cacti&quot;.

==History==
The cultivation of ornamental plants in gardening began in ancient civilizations around 2000 BC. Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings of 1500 BC show physical evidence of ornamental horticulture and landscape design. The wealthy pharaohs of Amun had plenty of lands to grow all different kinds of ornamental plants.

==Cultivation==
Ornamental plants and trees are distinguished from utilitarian and crop plants, such as those used for agriculture and vegetable crops, and for forestry or as fruit trees. This does not preclude any particular type of plant being grown both for ornamental qualities in the garden, and for utilitarian purposes in other settings. Thus lavender is typically grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, but may also be grown as a crop plant for the production of lavender oil.

Ornamental plants are frequently targeted by the Japanese beetle, a notorious insect pest known for its destructive feeding habits. With a voracious appetite, Japanese beetles pose a significant threat to various plant species, including ornamental flowers, fruit-bearing trees, and agricultural crops. Their indiscriminate feeding behavior can cause extensive damage to the foliage of ornamental plants, compromising their aesthetic appeal and overall health. This widespread recognition of the Japanese beetle&#x27;s impact underscores the importance of effective pest management strategies to protect ornamental gardens and landscapes from infestation.

==The term==
The term &quot;ornamental plant&quot; is used here in the same sense that it is generally used in the horticultural trades, in which they are often just called &quot;ornamentals&quot;. The term largely corresponds to &#x27;garden plant&#x27;, though the latter is much less precise, as any plant may be grown in a garden. Ornamental plants are plants that are grown for display purposes, rather than functional ones. While some plants are both ornamental and functional, people usually use the term &quot;ornamental plants&quot; to refer to plants which have no value beyond being attractive, although many people feel that this is value enough. Ornamental plants are the keystone of ornamental gardening, and they come in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors suitable to a broad array of climates, landscapes, and gardening needs.

Some ornamental plants are &quot;foliage plants&quot; grown mainly or entirely for their showy foliage; this is especially true of houseplants. Their foliage may be deciduous, turning bright orange, red, and yellow before dropping off in the fall, or evergreen, in which case it stays green year-round. Some ornamental foliage has a striking appearance created by lacy leaves or long needles, while other ornamentals are grown for distinctively colored leaves, such as silvery-gray ground covers and bright red grasses, among many others.

Other ornamental plants are cultivated for their blooms. Flowering ornamental plants are a key aspect of most gardens, with many flower gardeners preferring to plant a variety of flowers so that the garden is continuously in flower through the spring and summer. Depending on the types of plants being grown, the flowers may be subtle and delicate, or large and showy, with some ornamental plants producing distinctive aromas. Ornamental plants are beneficial.

==Ornamental grasses==
Ornamental grasses and grass-like plants are valued in home landscapes for their hardiness, ease of care, dramatic appearance, and a wide variety of colors, textures, and sizes available. Many ornamental types of grass are true grasses (Poaceae), however, several other families of grass-like plants are typically marketed as ornamental grasses. These include the sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae), restios (Restionaceae), and cat-tails (Typhaceae). All are monocotyledons, typically with narrow leaves and parallel veins. Most are herbaceous perennials, though many are evergreen and some develop woody tissues. Ornamental grasses are popular in many countries. They bring striking linear form, texture, color, motion, and sound to the garden, throughout the year.

Ornamental grasses are popular in many colder hardiness zones for their resilience to cold temperatures and aesthetic value throughout the fall and winter seasons.

<doc id="216429" wikidata="Q1780882" url="?curid=216429" title="List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States">
<text>The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest-ranking judicial body in the United States. Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum. Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.

==Background==

The Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the &quot;judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,&quot; and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court&#x27;s original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).

Since 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country&#x27;s own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court&#x27;s size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court&#x27;s size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court&#x27;s size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court&#x27;s size to nine members, where it has remained ever since.

While the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.

== List of justices ==
Since the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas&#x27;s to John Rutledge&#x27;s as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his as chief justice. As of , the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas&#x27;s to Ketanji Brown Jackson&#x27;s . Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge, Edward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan F. Stone and William Rehnquist. While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:


==Timeline of justices==
This graphical timeline depicts the progression of the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Information regarding each justice&#x27;s predecessors, successors, and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court, can be gleaned (and comparisons between justices drawn) from it. There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.

<doc id="216432" wikidata="Q7062022" url="?curid=216432" title="Not-for-profit arts organization">
<text>A not-for-profit arts organization, also known as a nonprofit arts organization, usually takes the form of a not-for-profit organization, nonprofit organization, association, or foundation. Such organizations are formed for the purpose of developing and promoting the work of artists in various visual and performing art forms such as film, sculpture, dance, painting, multimedia, poetry, and performance art.

==History==
Although museums and performing arts societies have existed for centuries, they have proliferated since the end of World War II. In particular, government sponsored organisations such as the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Canada Council, the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts, have been created to fund award grants to help promote the development of art and culture.

Not-for-profit legal service organizations provide services to artists and arts and cultural organizations. Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts (PVLA) is one such organization. Through its volunteer attorneys PVLA provides non-criminal legal assistance to artists and arts and cultural organizations on arts related issues.

==Canadian artist-run centres==
In Canada, a series of artist-run organizations often known as &quot;parallel galleries&quot; or artist-run centres (ARCs) have developed in cities across the country since the 1960s to encourage the exhibition of contemporary works by Canadian and international artists. The purpose is often to provide alternative spaces for exhibition for emerging artists and contemporary artists outside the commercial gallery system. Canadian ARCs usually pay a fee and de-emphasize the selling of work, although this will vary from gallery to gallery. A recommended schedule of payment is provided by the Canadian Artists&#x27; Representation (CARFAC), an artists&#x27; advocacy group.

==Not-for-profits versus nonprofits in the United States==
In the United States, not-for-profit organizations are defined separately from nonprofit organizations. Not-for-profits are groups that do not have salaried positions and are often collectives or social groups. Whereas nonprofits are organizations run by salaried employees and often volunteer boards with a community mission. These organizations operate like a business but have different tax identification and are supported additionally by grants. A museum is an example of a nonprofit, whereas an artists&#x27; collective may be an example of a not-for-profit.

<doc id="216434" wikidata="Q191826" url="?curid=216434" title="Tugboat">
<text>A tugboat or tug is a marine vessel that manoeuvres other vessels by pushing or pulling them, with direct contact or a tow line. These boats typically tug ships in circumstances where they cannot or should not move under their own power, such as in crowded harbors or narrow canals, or cannot move at all, such as barges, disabled ships, log rafts, or oil platforms. Some are ocean-going, and some are icebreakers or salvage tugs. Early models were powered by steam engines, which were later superseded by diesel engines. Many have deluge gun water jets, which help in firefighting, especially in harbours.

==Types==
===Seagoing===

Seagoing tugs (deep-sea tugs or ocean tugboats) fall into four basic categories:

#The standard seagoing tug with model bow that tows almost exclusively by way of a wire cable. In some rare cases, such as some USN fleet tugs, a synthetic rope hawser may be used for the tow in the belief that the line can be pulled aboard a disabled ship by the crew owing to its lightness compared to wire cable. 
#The &quot;notch tug&quot; can be secured by way of cables, or more commonly in recent times, synthetic lines that run from the stern of the tug to the stern of the barge. This configuration is generally used in inland waters where sea and swell are minimal because of the danger of parting the push wires. Often, this configuration is employed even without a &quot;notch&quot; on the barge, but in those cases it is preferable to have &quot;push knees&quot; on the tug to stabilize its position. Model bow tugs employing this method of pushing nearly always have a towing winch that can be used if sea conditions render pushing inadvisable. With this configuration, the barge being pushed might approach the size of a small ship, with the interaction of the water flow allowing a higher speed with a minimal increase in power required or fuel consumption.
#The &quot;integral unit&quot;, or &quot;integrated tug and barge&quot; (ITB), comprises specially designed vessels that lock together in such a rigid and strong method as to be certified as such by authorities (classification societies) such as the American Bureau of Shipping, Lloyd&#x27;s Register of Shipping, Indian Register of Shipping, Det Norske Veritas or several others. These units stay combined under virtually any sea conditions and the tugs usually have poor sea-keeping designs for navigation without their barges attached. Vessels in this category are legally considered to be ships rather than tugboats and barges must be staffed accordingly. These vessels must show navigation lights compliant with those required of ships rather than those required of tugboats and vessels undertow.
#&quot;Articulated tug and barge&quot; (ATB) units also utilize mechanical means to connect to their barges. The tug slips into a notch in the stern and is attached by a hinged connection, becoming an articulated vehicle. ATBs generally utilize Intercon and Bludworth connecting systems. ATBs are generally staffed as a large tugboat, with between seven and nine crew members. The typical American ATB displays navigational lights of a towing vessel pushing ahead, as described in the 1972 ColRegs.

===Harbour===
Compared with seagoing tugboats, harbour tugboats that are employed exclusively as ship assist vessels are generally smaller and their width-to-length ratio is often higher, due to the need for the tugs&#x27; wheelhouse to avoid contact with the hull of a ship, which may have a pronounced rake at the bow and stern. In some ports there is a requirement for certain numbers and sizes of tugboats for port operations with gas tankers. Also, in many ports, tankers are required to have tug escorts when transiting in harbors to render assistance in the event of mechanical failure. The port generally mandates a minimum horsepower or bollard pull, determined by the size of the escorted vessel. Most ports will have a number of tugs that are used for other purposes than ship assist, such as dredging operations, bunkering ships, transferring liquid products between berths, and cargo ops. These tugs may also be used for ship assist as needed. Modern ship assist tugs are &quot;omni directional tugs&quot; that employ propellers that can rotate 360 degrees without a rudder, like azimuthal stern drives (ASD), azimuthal tractor drives (ATD), Rotor tugs (RT) or cycloidal drives (VSP)(as described below).

===River===
River tugs are also referred to as towboats or pushboats. Their hull designs would make open ocean operations dangerous. River tugs usually do not have any significant hawser or winch. Their hulls feature a flat front or bow to line up with the rectangular stern of the barge, often with large pushing knees.

==Propulsion==
The first tugboat, &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, was built by William Symington in 1801. It had a steam engine and paddle wheels and was used on rivers in Scotland. Paddle tugs proliferated thereafter and were a common sight for a century.
In the 1870s schooner hulls were converted to screw tugs. Compound steam engines and scotch boilers provided 300 Indicated Horse Power. Steam tugs were put to use in every harbour of the world towing and ship berthing.

Tugboat diesel engines typically produce 500 to 2,500 kW (~ 680 to 3,400 hp), but larger boats (used in deep waters) can have power ratings up to 20,000 kW (~ 27,200 hp). Tugboats usually have an extreme power:tonnage-ratio; normal cargo and passenger ships have a P:T-ratio (in kW:GRT) of 0.35 to 1.20, whereas large tugs typically are 2.20 to 4.50 and small harbour-tugs 4.0 to 9.5. The engines are often the same as those used in railroad locomotives, but typically drive the propeller mechanically instead of converting the engine output to power electric motors, as is common for diesel-electric locomotives. For safety, tugboat engines often feature two of each critical part for redundancy.

A tugboat is typically rated by its engine&#x27;s power output and its overall bollard pull. The largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000s–2010s, used for towing container ships or similar, had around of bollard pull, which is described as above &quot;normal&quot; tugboats.

Tugboats are highly manoeuvrable, and various propulsion systems have been developed to increase manoeuvrability and increase safety. The earliest tugs were fitted with paddle wheels, but these were soon replaced by propeller-driven tugs. Kort nozzles (see below) have been added to increase thrust-to-power ratio. This was followed by the nozzle-rudder, which omitted the need for a conventional rudder. The cycloidal propeller (see below) was developed prior to World War II and was occasionally used in tugs because of its maneuverability. After World War II it was also linked to safety due to the development of the Voith Water Tractor, a tugboat configuration that could not be pulled over by its tow. In the late 1950s, the Z-drive or (azimuth thruster) was developed. Although sometimes referred to as the Aquamaster or Schottel system, many brands exist: Steerprop, Wärtsilä, Berg Propulsion, etc. These propulsion systems are used on tugboats designed for tasks such as ship docking and marine construction. Conventional propeller/rudder configurations are more efficient for port-to-port towing.

===Kort nozzle===

The Kort nozzle is a sturdy cylindrical structure around a special propeller having minimum clearance between the propeller blades and the inner wall of the Kort nozzle. The thrust-to-power ratio is enhanced because the water approaches the propeller in a linear configuration and exits the nozzle the same way. The Kort nozzle is named after its inventor, but many brands exist.

===Cyclorotor===

The cycloidal propeller is a circular plate mounted on the underside of the hull, rotating around a vertical axis with a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) that protrude out of the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis. The internal mechanism changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate, so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction, similar to the collective pitch control and cyclic in a helicopter.

==Fenders==
Tugboat fenders are made of high-abrasion-resistance rubber with good resilience properties. They are very popular with small port craft owners and tug owners. These fenders are generally made from cut pieces of vehicle tires strung together. Often the fendering on the sides of the tug is composed of large heavy equipment or aircraft tires attached to or hung on the side of the tug. Some fendering is compression moulded in high-pressure thermic-fluid-heated moulds and have excellent seawater resistance, but are not widely used owing to the cost. Tugboat bow fenders are also called beards or bow puds. In the past they were made of rope for padding to protect the bow, but rope rendering is almost never seen in recent times. Other types of tugboat fender include Tug cylindrical fender, W fender, M fender, D fender, and others.

==Carousel==
A recent Dutch innovation is the carousel tug, winner of the Maritime Innovation Award at the Dutch Maritime Innovation Awards Gala in 2006. It adds a pair of interlocking rings to the body of the tug, the inner on the boat, the outer on the ship by winch or towing hook. Since the towing point rotates freely, the tug is very difficult to capsize.

==Races==
Vintage tugboat races have been held annually in Olympia, Washington, since 1974 during the Olympia Harbor Days Maritime Festival
Tugboat races are held annually on Elliott Bay in Seattle, on the Hudson River at the New York Tugboat Race, the Detroit River, and the Great Tugboat Race and Parade on the St. Mary&#x27;s River.

==Ballet==
Since 1980, an annual tugboat ballet has been held in Hamburg harbour on the occasion of the festival commemorating the anniversary of the establishment of a port in Hamburg. On a weekend in May, eight tugboats perform choreographed movements for about an hour to the tunes of waltz and other sorts of dance music.

==Roundups==
The Tugboat Roundup is a gathering of tugboats and other vessels in celebration of maritime industry. The Waterford Tugboat Roundup is held in the late summer at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers in Waterford, New York. The tugs featured are river tugs and other tugs re-purposed to serve on the New York State Canal System.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; was the subject of a series of &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine stories featuring the female captain of the tugboat &quot;Narcissus&quot; in Puget Sound, later featured in the films &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (1933), &quot;Tugboat Annie Sails Again&quot; (1940) and &quot;Captain Tugboat Annie&quot; (1945). The Canadian television series &quot;The Adventures of Tugboat Annie&quot; was filmed in 1957.

===Film and television===
To date, there have been four children&#x27;s shows revolving around anthropomorphic tugboats. 
* In the late 1980s, 13 episodes were made of &quot;TUGS&quot;, a series depicting the life of tugboats in the 1920s. 
* An American adaptation using edited footage from &quot;Tugs&quot; followed: &quot;Salty&#x27;s Lighthouse&quot;. 
* In the 1975&#x27;s Soviet short animation musical film &quot;В порту/ In the sea port&quot; a tugboat sang a song: &quot;Through a harbour area&quot; 
* One of the creators of &quot;Tugs&quot; went on to direct &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot;.
* Animated preschool series &quot;Toot the Tiny Tugboat&quot; started broadcasting on Channel 5 &quot;Milkshake!&quot; in 2014 and on Cartoonito in 2015, with a Welsh-language version airing on S4C Cyw.

&quot;Tugger&quot; is a tugboat in the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;. He appears in the episode &quot;The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer&quot; as a sidekick for Russell Crowe in a fictitious television series entitled &quot;Fightin&#x27; Round The World with Russell Crowe&quot;. Tugger follows Crowe as he engages various people in physical conflicts, providing emotional support and comic relief. At one point Tugger even attempts to commit suicide, upon being forced to hear Russell Crowe&#x27;s new musical composition.

===Literature===
(Alphabetical by author)
*The children&#x27;s book &quot;Scuffy the Tugboat&quot;, written by Gertrude Crampton and illustrated by Tibor Gergely and first published in 1946 as part of the Little Golden Books series, follows the adventures of a young toy tugboat who seeks a life beyond the confines of a tub inside his owner&#x27;s toy store.
*The Dutch writer Jan de Hartog wrote numerous nautical novels, first in Dutch, then in English. 
**The novel &quot;Hollands Glorie&quot;, written prior to World War II, was made into a Dutch miniseries in 1978 and concerned the dangers faced by the crews of Dutch salvage tugs.
**The novella &quot;Stella&quot;, concerning the dangers faced by the captains of rescue tugs in the English Channel during World War II, was made into a film entitled &quot;The Key&quot; in 1958.
**The novel &quot;The Captain&quot; (1967), about the captain of a rescue tug during a Murmansk Convoy, sold over a million copies.
**Its 1986 sequel, &quot;The Commodore&quot;, features the narrator captaining a fleet of tugs in peace-time.
*&quot;Little Toot&quot; (1939), written and illustrated by Hardie Gramatky, is a children&#x27;s story of an anthropomorphic tugboat child, who wants to help tow ships in a harbour near Hoboken. He&#x27;s rejected by the tugboat community and dejectedly drifts out to sea, where he accidentally discovers a shipwrecked liner and a chance to prove his worth. This story was animated as part of the Disney movie &quot;Melody Time&quot;.
*Farley Mowat&#x27;s book &quot;The Grey Seas Under&quot; tells the tale of a legendary North Atlantic salvage tug, the &quot;Foundation Franklin&quot;. He later wrote &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Coil&quot;, which also deals with salvage tugs in the North Atlantic.

<doc id="216440" wikidata="Q123037" url="?curid=216440" title="Mohammad Mosaddegh">
<text>Mohammad Mosaddegh (, ; 16 June 1882 – 5 March 1967) was an Iranian politician, author, and lawyer who served as the 30th Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 to 1953, elected by the 16th Majlis. He was a member of the Iranian parliament from 1923, and served through a contentious 1952 election into the 17th Iranian Majlis, until his government was overthrown in the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;etat aided by the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom (MI6) and the United States (CIA), led by Kermit Roosevelt Jr. His National Front was suppressed from the 1954 election.

Before its removal from power, his administration introduced a range of social and political measures such as social security, land reforms and higher taxes including the introduction of taxation on the rent of land. His government&#x27;s most significant policy was the nationalisation of the Iranian oil industry, which had been built by the British on Persian lands since 1913 through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC/), later known as British Petroleum (BP).

In the aftermath of the overthrow, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi returned to power, and negotiated the Consortium Agreement of 1954 with the British, which gave split ownership of Iranian oil production between Iran and western companies until 1979. Mosaddegh was imprisoned for three years, then put under house arrest until his death and was buried in his own home so as to prevent a political furor. In 2013, the US government formally acknowledged its role in the coup as being a part of its foreign policy initiatives, including paying protestors and bribing officials.

== Early life, education and early career ==
Mosaddegh was born to a prominent Persian family of high officials in Ahmedabad, near Tehran, on 16 June 1882; his father, Mirza Hideyatu&#x27;llah Ashtiani, was the finance minister under the Qajar dynasty, and his mother, Princess Malek Taj Najm-es-Saltaneh, was the granddaughter of the reformist Qajar prince Abbas Mirza, and a great-granddaughter of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. When Mosaddegh&#x27;s father died in 1892, his uncle was appointed the tax collector of the Khorasan province and was bestowed with the title of Mosaddegh-os-Saltaneh by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. Mosaddegh himself later bore the same title, by which he was still known to some long after titles were abolished.

In 1901, Mosaddegh married Zahra Emami (1879–1965), a granddaughter of Naser al-Din Shah through her mother Zi&#x27;a es-Saltaneh.

=== Education ===
In 1909, Mosaddegh pursued education abroad in Paris, France, where he studied at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). He studied there for two years, returning to Iran because of illness in 1911. After two months, Mosaddegh returned to Europe to study a Doctorate of Laws (&quot;doctorate en Droit&quot;) at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. In June 1913, Mosaddegh received his doctorate and in doing so became the first Iranian to receive a PhD in law from a European university.

Mosaddegh taught at the Tehran School of Political Science at the start of World War I before beginning his political career.

=== Early political career ===
Mosaddegh started his political career with the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–07. At the age of 24, he was elected from Isfahan to the newly inaugurated Persian Parliament, the Majlis of Iran. However, he was unable to assume his seat, because he had not reached the legal age of 30.
During this period he also served as deputy leader of the Society of Humanity, under Mostowfi ol-Mamalek. In protest at the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1919, he relocated to Switzerland, from where he returned the following year after being invited by the new Iranian prime minister, Hassan Pirnia (Moshir-ed-Dowleh), to become his minister of justice. While en route to Tehran, he was asked by the people of Shiraz to become the governor of the Fars province. He was later appointed finance minister, in the government of Ahmad Qavam (Qavam os-Saltaneh) in 1921, and then foreign minister in the government of Moshir-ed-Dowleh in June 1923. He then became governor of the Azerbaijan Province. In 1923, he was re-elected to the Majlis.

In 1925, the supporters of Reza Khan in the Majlis proposed legislation to dissolve the Qajar dynasty and appoint Reza Khan the new Shah. Mossadegh voted against such a move, arguing that such an act was a subversion of the 1906 Iranian constitution. He gave a speech in the Majlis, praising Reza Khan&#x27;s achievements as prime minister while encouraging him to respect the constitution and stay as the prime minister. On 12 December 1925, the Majlis deposed the young Shah Ahmad Shah Qajar and declared Reza Shah the new monarch of the Imperial State of Persia, and the first Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. Mosaddegh then retired from politics, due to disagreements with the new regime.

In 1941, Reza Shah Pahlavi was forced by the British to abdicate in favour of his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1944, Mosaddegh was once again elected to parliament. This time he took the lead of &quot;Jebhe Melli&quot; (National Front of Iran, created in 1949), an organisation he had founded with nineteen others such as Hossein Fatemi, Ahmad Zirakzadeh, Ali Shayegan and Karim Sanjabi, aiming to establish democracy and end the foreign presence in Iranian politics, especially by nationalising the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&#x27;s (AIOC) operations in Iran. In 1947 Mossadegh once again announced retirement, after an electoral-reform bill he had proposed failed to pass through Majlis.

== Prime Minister of Iran ==
=== Election ===

On 28 April 1951, the Shah confirmed Mosaddegh as Prime Minister after the Majlis (Parliament of Iran) elected Mosaddegh by a vote of 79–12. After a period of assassinations by Fada&#x27;iyan-e Islam and political unrest by the National Front, the Shah was aware of Mosaddegh&#x27;s rising popularity and political power. Demonstrations erupted in Tehran after Mosaddegh was elected, with crowds further invigorated by the speeches of members from the National Front. There was a special focus on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the heavy involvement of foreign actors and influences in Iranian affairs. Although Iran was not officially a colony or a protectorate, it was still heavily controlled by foreign powers beginning with concessions provided by the Qajar Shahs and leading up to the oil agreement signed by Reza Shah in 1933.

The new administration introduced a wide range of social reforms: unemployment compensation was introduced, factory owners were ordered to pay benefits to sick and injured workers, and peasants were freed from forced labour in their landlords&#x27; estates. In 1952, Mosaddegh passed the Land Reform Act, which forced landlords to place 20% of their revenue into a development fund. This development fund paid for various projects such as public baths, rural housing, and pest control.

On 1 May, Mosaddegh nationalised the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, cancelling its oil concession, which was otherwise set to expire in 1993, and expropriating its assets. Mosaddegh saw the AIOC as an arm of the British government controlling much of the oil in Iran, pushing him to seize what the British had built in Iran. The next month, a committee of five majlis deputies was sent to Khuzistan to enforce the nationalisation. Mosaddegh justified his nationalisation policy by claiming Iran was &quot;the rightful owner...&quot; of all the oil in Iran. He also pointed out that Iran could use the money in a 21 June 1951 speech:

The confrontation between Iran and Britain escalated as Mosaddegh&#x27;s government refused to allow the British any involvement in their former enterprise. Britain made sure Iran could sell the oil, which it considered stolen. In July, Mosaddegh broke off negotiations with AIOC after it threatened to &quot;pull out its employees&quot; and told owners of oil tanker ships that &quot;receipts from the Iranian government would not be accepted on the world market.&quot; Two months later, the AIOC evacuated its technicians and closed down the oil installations. Under nationalised management, many refineries lacked the trained technicians that were needed to continue production. The British government announced a &quot;de facto&quot; blockade and embargo, reinforced its naval force in the Persian Gulf, and lodged complaints against Iran before the United Nations Security Council, where, on 15 October 1951, Mosaddegh declared that &quot;the petroleum industry has contributed nothing to well-being of the people or to the technological progress or industrial development of my country.&quot;

The British government also threatened legal action against purchasers of oil produced in the Iranian refineries and obtained an agreement with its sister international oil companies not to fill the void left by the AIOC. The entire Iranian oil industry came to a virtual standstill, with oil production dropping almost 96% from in 1950 to in 1952. This Abadan Crisis reduced Iran&#x27;s oil income to almost nothing, putting a severe strain on the implementation of Mosaddegh&#x27;s promised domestic reforms. At the same time, BP and Aramco doubled their production in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq to make up for lost production in Iran so that no hardship was felt in Britain.

Still enormously popular in late 1951, Mosaddegh called elections and introduced a modified version of his 1944 electoral reform bill. As his base of support was in urban areas and not in the provinces, the proposed reform no longer barred illiterate voters, but it placed them into a separate category from literate voters and increased the representation of the urban population. The opposition defeated the bill on the grounds that it would &quot;unjustly discriminate patriots who had been voting for the last forty years&quot;, thus leaving the National Front to compete against conservatives, royalists, and tribal leaders alike in the upcoming election.

His government came under scrutiny for ending the 1952 election before rural votes could be fully counted. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian: &quot;Realizing that the opposition would take the vast majority of the provincial seats, Mosaddegh stopped the voting as soon as 79 deputies—just enough to form a parliamentary quorum—had been elected.&quot; An alternative account is offered by journalist Stephen Kinzer: Beginning in the early 1950s under the guidance of C.M. Woodhouse, chief of the British intelligence station in Tehran, Britain&#x27;s covert operations network had funnelled roughly £10,000 per month to the Rashidian brothers (two of Iran&#x27;s most influential royalists) in the hope of buying off, according to CIA estimates, &quot;the armed forces, the Majlis (Iranian parliament), religious leaders, the press, street gangs, politicians and other influential figures&quot;. Thus, in his statement asserting electoral manipulation by &quot;foreign agents&quot;, Mosaddegh suspended the elections. His National Front party had made up 30 of the 79 deputies elected. Yet none of those present vetoed the statement, and completion of the elections was postponed indefinitely. The 17th Majlis convened in April 1952, with the minimum required of the 136 seats filled.

Throughout his career, Mosaddegh strove to increase the power parliament held versus the expansion of the crown&#x27;s authority. But tension soon began to escalate in the Majlis. Conservative, pro-Shah, and pro-British opponents refused to grant Mosaddegh special powers to deal with the economic crisis caused by the sharp drop in revenue and voiced regional grievances against the capital Tehran, while the National Front waged &quot;a propaganda war against the landed upper class&quot;.

=== Resignation and uprising ===

On the 16th of July 1952, during the royal approval of his new cabinet, Mosaddegh insisted on the constitutional prerogative of the Prime Minister to name a Minister of War and the Chief of Staff, something the Shah had done up to that point. The Shah refused, seeing it as a means for Mosaddegh to consolidate his power over the government at the expense of the monarchy. In response, Mosaddegh announced his resignation, appealing directly to the public for support, pronouncing that &quot;in the present situation, the struggle started by the Iranian people cannot be brought to a victorious conclusion&quot;.

Veteran politician Ahmad Qavam (also known as Ghavam os-Saltaneh) was appointed as Iran&#x27;s new Prime Minister. On the day of his appointment, he announced his intention to resume negotiations with the British to end the oil dispute, a reversal of Mosaddegh&#x27;s policy. The National Front—along with various Nationalist, Islamist, and socialist parties and groups—including Tudeh—responded by calling for protests, assassinations of the Shah and other royalists, strikes, and mass demonstrations in favour of Mosaddegh. Major strikes broke out in all of Iran&#x27;s major towns, with the Bazaar closing down in Tehran. Over 250 demonstrators in Tehran, Hamadan, Ahvaz, Isfahan, and Kermanshah were killed or suffered serious injuries.

On the fourth day of mass demonstrations, Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani called on the people to wage a &quot;holy war&quot; against Qavam. On the following day, &quot;Si-ye Tir&quot; (the 30th of Tir on the Iranian calendar), military commanders ordered their troops back to barracks, fearful of over-straining the enlisted men&#x27;s loyalty, and left Tehran in the hands of the protesters. Frightened by the unrest, the Shah asked for Qavam&#x27;s resignation and re-appointed Mosaddegh to form a government, granting him control over the Ministry of War he had previously demanded. The Shah asked whether he should step down as monarch, but Mosaddegh declined.

=== Reinstatement and emergency powers ===

More popular than ever, a greatly strengthened Mosaddegh introduced a single-clause bill to parliament to grant him emergency &quot;dictatorial decree&quot; powers for six months to pass &quot;any law he felt necessary for obtaining not only financial solvency, but also electoral, judicial, and educational reforms&quot; in order to implement his nine-point reform program and to bypass the stalled negotiations of the nationalisation of the oil industry. On the 3rd of August 1952, the Majlis voted in approval and elected Ayatollah Kashani as House Speaker. Kashani&#x27;s Islamic scholars, as well as the Tudeh Party, proved to be two of Mosaddegh&#x27;s key political allies, although relations with both were often strained.

In addition to the reform program, which intended to make changes to a broad region of laws covering elections, financial institutions, employment, the judiciary, the press, education, health, and communications services, Mosaddegh tried to limit the monarchy&#x27;s powers. He cut the Shah&#x27;s personal budget, forbade his direct communications with foreign diplomats, and transferred royal lands back to the state. He also expelled the Shah&#x27;s politically active sister, Ashraf Pahlavi.

However, six months proved not long enough, so Mosaddegh asked for an extension in January 1953, successfully pressing Parliament to extend his emergency powers for another 12 months.

Though the Shah had only initiated land reforms in January 1951, where all territory inherited by the Crown was sold to peasants at 20% of the assessed value over a payment period of 25 years, Mosaddegh decreed a new land reform law to supersede it, establishing village councils and increasing the peasants&#x27; share of production. This weakened the landed aristocracy by imposing a 20% tax on their income, of which 20% was diverted back to the crop-sharing tenants and their rural banks. It also weakened them by levying heavy fines for compelling peasants to work without wages. Mosaddegh attempted to abolish Iran&#x27;s centuries-old feudal agriculture sector by replacing it with a system of collective farming and government land ownership, which also centralised power in his government. Ann Lambton indicates that Mosaddegh saw this as a means of checking the power of the Tudeh Party, who had been agitating the peasants by criticising his lack of significant land reforms.

Despite these accomplishments, Iranians were &quot;becoming poorer and unhappier by the day&quot;, in large part due to the British-led boycott. As Mosaddegh&#x27;s political coalition began to fray, his enemies increased in number.

Partly through the efforts of Iranians sympathising with the British, and partly in fear of the growing dictatorial powers of the Prime Minister, several former members of Mosaddegh&#x27;s coalition turned against him, fearing arrest. They included Mozzafar Baghai, head of the worker-based Toilers party; Hossein Makki, who had helped lead the takeover of the Abadan refinery and was at one point considered Mosaddegh&#x27;s successor; and most outspokenly, Ayatollah Kashani, who damned Mosaddegh with the &quot;vitriol he had once reserved for the British&quot;. The reason for difference of opinion among Makki and Mosaddegh was the sharp response of Mosaddegh to Kashani, who he saw as a largely inoffensive scholar who attracted public support. Hossein Makki strongly opposed the dissolution of the majlis by Mossadegh and evaluated that, because of its closure, the right to dismiss the Prime minister is reserved for the Shah.

== Overthrow of Mosaddegh ==
=== Plot to depose Mosaddegh ===
The British government had grown increasingly distressed over Mosaddegh&#x27;s policies and were especially bitter over the loss of their control of the Iranian oil industry. Repeated attempts to reach a settlement had failed, and, in October 1952, Mosaddegh declared Britain an enemy and cut all diplomatic relations. Since 1935, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had the exclusive rights to Iranian oil. Earlier in 1914, the British government had purchased 51% of its shares and became the majority shareholder. After the British Royal Navy converted its ships to use oil as fuel, the corporation was considered vital to British national security, and the company&#x27;s profits partially alleviated Britain&#x27;s budget deficit.

Engulfed in a variety of problems following World War II, Britain was unable to resolve the issue single-handedly and looked towards the United States to settle the matter. Initially, the US had opposed British policies. After mediation had failed several times to bring about a settlement, American Secretary of State Dean Acheson concluded that the British were &quot;destructive, and determined on a rule-or-ruin policy in Iran.&quot;

The American position shifted in late 1952 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected president. In November and December, British intelligence officials suggested to American intelligence that the Iranian prime minister should be ousted. British prime minister Winston Churchill suggested to the incoming Eisenhower administration that Mosaddegh, despite the latter&#x27;s open dislike of communism, would become reliant on the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party, resulting in Iran &quot;increasingly turning towards communism&quot; and towards the Soviet sphere at a time of high Cold War fears.

Though his suggestion was rebuffed by Eisenhower as &quot;paternalistic&quot;, Churchill&#x27;s government had already begun &quot;Operation Boot&quot;, and simply waited for the next opportunity to press the Americans. On 28 February 1953, rumours spread by British-backed Iranians that Mosaddegh was trying to exile the Shah from the country gave the Eisenhower administration the impetus to join the plan. The United States and the United Kingdom agreed to work together toward Mosaddegh&#x27;s removal and began to publicly denounce Mosaddegh&#x27;s policies for Iran as harmful to the country. In the meantime, the already precarious alliance between Mosaddegh and Kashani was severed in January 1953, when Kashani opposed Mosaddegh&#x27;s demand that his increased powers be extended for a period of one year. Finally, to end Mossadegh&#x27;s destabilising influence that threatened the supply of oil to the West and could potentially pave the way for a communist takeover of the country, the US made an attempt to depose him.

=== Operation Ajax ===

In March 1953, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles directed the CIA, which was headed by his younger brother Allen Dulles, to draft plans to overthrow Mossadegh. On 4 April 1953, Dulles approved $1 million to be used &quot;in any way that would bring about the fall of Mosaddegh&quot;. Soon the CIA&#x27;s Tehran station started to launch a propaganda campaign against Mossadegh. Finally, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in early June, American and British intelligence officials met again, this time in Beirut, and put the finishing touches on the strategy. Soon afterward, according to his later published accounts, the chief of the CIA&#x27;s Near East and Africa division, Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. the grandson of US President Theodore Roosevelt, arrived in Tehran to direct it. In 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot; made partial publication of a leaked CIA document titled &quot;Clandestine Service History – Overthrow of Premier Mosaddegh of Iran – November 1952 – August 1953&quot;.

The plot, known as Operation Ajax, centered on convincing Iran&#x27;s monarch to issue a decree to dismiss Mosaddegh from office, as he had attempted some months earlier. But the Shah was terrified to attempt such a dangerously unpopular and risky move against Mosaddegh. It would take much persuasion and many US-funded meetings, which included bribing his sister Ashraf with a mink coat and money, to successfully change his mind.

Mosaddegh became aware of the plots against him and grew increasingly wary of conspirators acting within his government. According to Donald Wilber, who was involved in the plot to remove Mossadegh from power, in early August, Iranian CIA operatives pretending to be socialists and nationalists threatened Muslim leaders with &quot;savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh&quot;, thereby giving the impression that Mossadegh was cracking down on dissent earlier than planned, and stirring anti-Mossadegh sentiments within the religious community. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99 per cent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against. According to historian Mark Gasiorowski, &quot;There were separate polling stations for yes and no votes, producing sharp criticism of Mosaddeq&quot; and that the &quot;controversial referendum...gave the CIA&#x27;s precoup propaganda campaign to show up Mosaddeq as an anti-democratic dictator an easy target&quot;. On or around 16 August, Parliament was suspended indefinitely, and Mosaddeq&#x27;s emergency powers were extended.

Declassified documents released by the CIA in 2017 revealed that—after the Shah had fled to Italy—CIA headquarters believed the coup to have failed. Following the initial failed coup by the foreign-backed General Fazlollah Zahedi, the CIA sent Roosevelt a telegram on 18 August 1953 telling him to flee Iran immediately, but Roosevelt ignored it and began work on the second coup, circulating a false account that Mossadegh attempted to seize the throne and bribed Iranian agents.
Soon, massive popular protests, aided by Roosevelt&#x27;s team, took place across the city and elsewhere with tribesmen at the ready to assist the coup, with anti- and pro-monarchy protesters, both being paid by Roosevelt. By paying mobs to demonstrate, tricking Mossadegh into urging his supporters to stay home, and bribing and mobilising officers against Mossadegh, he was able to force a military confrontation outside Mossadegh&#x27;s home.

The protests turned increasingly violent, leaving almost 300 dead, at which point the pro-monarchy leadership, led by retired army General and former Minister of Interior in Mosaddegh&#x27;s cabinet, Fazlollah Zahedi, interceded, joined with underground figures such as the Rashidian brothers and local strongman Shaban Jafari. Pro-Shah tank regiments stormed the capital and bombarded the prime minister&#x27;s official residence. With loyalist troops overwhelmed, Mossadegh was taken into hiding by his aides, narrowly escaping the mob that set in to ransack his house. The following day, he surrendered himself at the Officers&#x27; Club, where General Zahedi had been set up with makeshift headquarters by the CIA. Zahedi announced an order for his arrest on the radio, and Mosaddegh was transferred to a military jail shortly after.

The Shah finally agreed to Mossadegh&#x27;s overthrow after Roosevelt said that the United States would proceed with or without him, and formally dismissed the prime minister in a written decree, an act that had been made part of the constitution during the Constitutional Assembly of 1949, convened under martial law, at which time the power of the monarchy was increased in various ways by the Shah himself. As a precautionary measure, he flew to Baghdad and from there hid safely in Rome. He actually signed two decrees, one dismissing Mosaddegh and the other nominating the CIA&#x27;s choice, General Zahedi, as Prime Minister. These decrees, called &quot;Farmāns&quot;, played a major role in giving legitimacy to the coup, and were further spread by CIA officials. On 22 August, the Shah returned from Rome.
Zahedi&#x27;s new government soon reached an agreement with foreign oil companies to form a consortium and &quot;restore the flow of Iranian oil to world markets in substantial quantities&quot;, giving the United States and Great Britain the lion&#x27;s share of the restored British holdings. In return, the US massively funded the Shah&#x27;s resulting government, until the Shah&#x27;s overthrow in 1979.

As soon as the coup succeeded, many of Mosaddegh&#x27;s former associates and supporters were tried, imprisoned, and tortured. Some were sentenced to death and executed. The minister of foreign affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, Hossein Fatemi, was executed by order of the Shah&#x27;s military court. The order was carried out by firing squad on 10 November 1954.

== Post-overthrow life ==
On 21 December 1953, Mosaddegh was sentenced to three years&#x27; solitary confinement in a military prison, well short of the death sentence requested by prosecutors. After hearing the sentence, Mossadegh was reported to have said with a calm voice of sarcasm: &quot;The verdict of this court has increased my historical glories. I am extremely grateful you convicted me. Truly tonight the Iranian nation understood the meaning of constitutionalism.&quot;

Mosaddegh was kept under house arrest at his Ahmadabad residence, until his death on 5 March 1967. He was denied a funeral and was buried in his living room, despite his request to be buried in the public graveyard, beside the victims of the political violence on 30 Tir 1331 (21 July 1952).

== Electoral history ==
== Legacy ==

=== Iran ===

Although Mosaddegh was never directly elected as Prime Minister, he enjoyed massive popularity throughout most of his career. Despite beginning to fall out of favour during the later stages of the Abadan Crisis, the secret U.S. overthrow of Mosaddegh served as a rallying point in anti-US protests during the 1979 Iranian revolution, and to this day he is one of the most popular figures in Iranian history.

The withdrawal of support for Mosaddegh by the powerful Shia clergy has been regarded as having been motivated by their fear of a communist takeover. Some argue that while many elements of Mosaddegh&#x27;s coalition abandoned him, it was the loss of support from Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani and another cleric that was fatal to his cause, reflective of the dominance of the Ulema in Iranian society and a portent of the Islamic Revolution to come. The loss of the political clerics effectively cut Mosaddegh&#x27;s connections with the lower middle classes and the Iranian masses which are crucial to any popular movement in Iran.

On 5 March 1979, not even a month after the Shah was deposed, hundreds of thousands of Iranians marked the 12th anniversary of Mossadegh&#x27;s death. In Ahmadabad, where he was buried, Iranian leaders and politicians eulogized him in a way that would&#x27;ve been unthinkable before the Shah&#x27;s removal. It was estimated that the crowd in size was over one million. The event was described as:For sixty solid miles, the highway from Tehran to Mossadeq&#x27;s burial site...transformed into a massive, unbroken daisy chain of cars...In the final seven or eight miles approaching the village, traffic became so gridlocked that mourners were forced to...complete the journey on foot.

=== U.S. ===

The U.S. role in Mosaddegh&#x27;s overthrow was not formally acknowledged for many years, although the Eisenhower administration vehemently opposed Mossadegh&#x27;s policies. President Eisenhower wrote angrily about Mosaddegh in his memoirs, describing him as impractical and naive.

Eventually, the CIA&#x27;s involvement with the coup was exposed. This caused controversy within the organisation and the CIA congressional hearings of the 1970s. CIA supporters maintained that the coup was strategically necessary and praised the efficiency of the agents responsible. Critics say the scheme was paranoid, colonial, illegal, and immoral—and truly caused the &quot;blowback&quot; suggested in the pre-coup analysis. The extent of this &quot;blowback&quot;, over time, was not completely clear to the CIA, as they had an inaccurate picture of the stability of the Shah&#x27;s regime. The Iranian revolution of 1979 caught the CIA and the U.S. very much off guard (as CIA reporting a mere month earlier predicted no imminent insurrectionary turbulence whatsoever for the Shah&#x27;s regime) and resulted in the overthrow of the Shah by a fundamentalist faction opposed to the U.S., headed by Ayatollah Khomeini. In retrospect, not only did the CIA and the U.S. underestimate the extent of popular discontent for the Shah, but much of that discontent historically stemmed from the removal of Mosaddegh and the subsequent clientelism of the Shah.

In March 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated her regret that Mosaddegh was ousted: &quot;The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons. But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran&#x27;s political development and it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America.&quot; In the same year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a detailed report about the coup based on declassified CIA documents.

=== British ===
Mosaddegh&#x27;s overthrow had a direct relationship with the creation of an Islamic revolution and the collapse of the Pahlavi government. America&#x27;s close relationship with the Shah and the subsequent hostility of the United States to the Islamic Republic and Britain&#x27;s profitable interventions caused pessimism for Iranians, stirring nationalism and suspicion of foreign interference.

== Mosaddegh in the media ==

* Mosaddegh was named man of the year in 1951 by &quot;Time&quot;. Others considered for that year&#x27;s title included Dean Acheson, General (and future President) Dwight D. Eisenhower and General Douglas MacArthur.
* The figure of Mosaddegh was an important element in the 2003 French TV production &quot;&quot;, which deals with the life of the Shah&#x27;s second wife and former Queen of Iran, Princess Soraya Esfandiary Bakhtiari. Mosaddegh&#x27;s role was played by the French actor Claude Brasseur.
* In &quot;Argo&quot;, Malick (Victor McCay) references Mosaddegh and the coup as he and Bates (Titus Welliver) try to deal with the situation at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
* A short 24-minute film titled &quot;Mosaddegh&quot;, directed by Roozbeh Dadvand, was released in 2011. The role of Mosaddegh was played by Iranian American actor David Diaan.
* An independent video game called &quot;The Cat and the Coup&quot; was released in 2011. It features the player playing as Mosaddegh&#x27;s cat reversing Mosaddegh&#x27;s life to the beginning.
* In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders, during debates, interviews, and speeches, repeatedly praised Mosaddegh&#x27;s &quot;secular, democratic government&quot;, while commenting on the 1953 CIA-backed coup, stating that it is a &quot;bad example of U.S. foreign policy&quot;, resulting in &quot;negative unintended consequences and dictatorships&quot;. Another candidate, Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley, said similar things.
* In &quot;Coup 53&quot;, a 2021 documentary, co-writers Taghi Amirani and Walter Murch assess new archive material about the 1953 CIA-backed coup of Mossadegh. The documentary&#x27;s primary contribution is to uncover the extent of MI6 involvement, particularly that of Norman Darbyshire, the operative who led MI6&#x27;s involvement in the coup. According to the newly discovered archive material, Darbyshire was involved in the kidnapping, torture, and assassination of General Mahmoud Afshartous, Mosaddegh&#x27;s chief of police, and the bribing of Princess Ashraf, the twin sister of Shah Reza Pahlavi, to obtain the Shah&#x27;s approval for the coup. The British government has never admitted its involvement in the overthrow of Mosaddegh.
* In neighbouring Afghanistan, support and sympathy for Mosaddegh was evident in a 1953 article in the Kabul-based &quot;Pamir&quot; newspaper under the title &quot;A friendly suggestion to the great nation of Iran&quot;, urging the authorities of the time to use best judgment during the trial regarding a man like Mosaddegh.

<text>The iPAQ is a discontinued line of Pocket PC devices produced from 2000 until 2010. It was first unveiled by Compaq in April 2000. iPAQ included PDA-devices, smartphones and GPS-navigators. A substantial number of devices were outsourced from Taiwanese HTC corporation.

Following Hewlett-Packard (HP)&#x27;s acquisition of Compaq, the product had been marketed by HP. The devices use a Windows Mobile interface. In addition to this, there are several Linux distributions that also operate on some of these devices. Earlier units were modular. Sleeve accessories were released called &quot;jackets&quot;, which slide around the unit and add functionality such as a card reader, wireless networking, GPS, and extra batteries. Later versions of iPAQs have most of these features integrated into the base device itself, some including GPRS mobile telephony (SIM card slot and radio).

==History==
The name was borrowed from Compaq&#x27;s earlier iPAQ Desktop Personal Computers. 

The iPAQ was developed by Compaq based on the SA-1110 &quot;Assabet&quot; and SA-1111 &quot;Neponset&quot; reference boards that were engineered by a StrongARM development group located at Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Hudson Massachusetts facility. At the time when these boards were in development, this facility was acquired by Intel. When the &quot;Assabet&quot; board is combined with the &quot;Neponset&quot; companion processor board they provide support for 32 megabytes of SDRAM in addition to CompactFlash and PCMCIA slots along with an I2S or AC-Link serial audio bus, PS/2 mouse and trackpad interfaces, a USB host controller and 18 additional GPIO pins. Software drivers for a CompactFlash Ethernet device, IDE storage devices such as the IBM Microdrive and the Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11 Wifi device were also available. An earlier StrongARM SA-1100 based research handheld device call the &quot;Itsy&quot; had been developed at Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Western Research Laboratory (later to become the Compaq Western Research Laboratory).

The first iPAQ Pocket PC was the H3600 series, released in 2000. It ran Microsoft&#x27;s Pocket PC 2000 operating system, and featured a 240 x 320 pixel 4096-color LCD, 32 MB of RAM, and 16 MB of ROM. Compaq released a similarly-designed H3100 series Pocket PC in January, 2001. It was a lower-priced model with a 15-greyscale monochrome LCD, 16 MB of RAM, and a dark grey D-pad instead of the chrome D-pad of its predecessor. The H3600 series was succeeded by the H3800 and H3900 series, which retained the same form factor, but had a different button layout.

Soon after HP&#x27;s merger with Compaq in 2002, HP discontinued its Jornada line of Microsoft Windows powered Pocket PCs, and continued the iPAQ line that started under Compaq.

In June 2003, HP retired the h3xxx line of iPAQs and introduced the h1xxx line of iPAQs targeted at price conscious buyers, the h2xxx consumer line, and the h5xxx line, targeted at business customers. They were sold pre-installed with the Windows Mobile for Pocket PC 2003 Operating System. The h63xx series of iPAQs running the Phone Edition of Windows Mobile 2003, the hx47xx series and the rz17xx series, both running the Second Edition of Windows Mobile 2003 were introduced in August 2004.

In August 2004, HP released the rz17xx and rx3xxx series of Mobile Media Companions. These devices were aimed at consumers, rather than the traditional corporate audience. Emphasis was placed on media features, like NEVO TV Remote and Mobile Media. They ran on Windows Mobile 2003SE.

In February 2005, the iPAQ Mobile Messenger hw6500 series was introduced to selected media at the 3GSM conference in Cannes, France. It was replaced a year later by the hw6900 series, running on Windows Mobile 5.

In 2007, the iPAQ rx4000 Mobile Media Companion PDA/media devices and rx5000 Travel Companion PDA/GPS devices were released. Both series of iPAQs work on the Windows Mobile 5 Operating System (WM5), as do the hx2000 and hw6900 series. The first HP Windows Mobile 6 device, the iPAQ 500 Series Voice Messenger, with the Windows Mobile 6 Standard Operating System (WM6), and numeric pad, was released in the same year.

The entire iPAQ line was completely revamped by the introduction of five new iPAQ series to complement the introduction of the iPAQ 500 Series Voice Messenger earlier in the year. The models announced were the 100 Series Classic Handheld, the 200 Series Enterprise Handheld, the 300 Series Travel Companion, the 600 Series Business Navigator and the 900 Series Business Messenger. The 100 and 200 Series are regular touchscreen PDAs without phone functionality running WM6. The 300 Series Travel Companion is not a PDA; marketed as a Personal Navigation Device, it is a handheld GPS unit operating on the Windows CE 5.0 core Operating System with a custom user interface. The 600 and 900 series are phones with integrated GPS and 3G capabilities, running the WM6 Professional. The 600 series possesses a numeric pad and the 900 series features a full QWERTY keyboard.

Hewlett-Packard introduced a smartphone iPAQ Pocket PC that looks like a regular cell phone and has VoIP capability. The series is the HP iPAQ 500 Series Voice Messenger.

In December 2009, HP released the iPAQ Glisten, running on Windows Mobile 6.5.

In mid-August 2011, HP announced that they would be discontinuing all webOS devices.

==Model list==

===Jacket-compatible===
These older models are compatible with the iPAQ Jacket which can accept 1× CompactFlash, 1× PC Card or 2× PC Card slots.

iPAQ jacket PN 173396-001 PCMCIA (PC port) 1× internal Li-ion battery PN 167648 3.7 V 1500 mAh (upgradable).

===Newer models===

* SDIO can support up to 2GB.

==Alternative operating systems for the iPAQ==

===OpenEmbedded===
The OpenEmbedded distribution is (as of 2016) the only actively maintained Linux distribution for the iPAQ models, by way of the meta-handheld layer.

===Familiar Linux===
An alternative Linux-based OS available for the iPAQ was Familiar. It stopped being actively maintained in 2007.

It was available with the Opie or GPE GUI environment, or as a base Linux system with no GUI if preferred.

Both Opie and GPE provided the usual PIM suite (calendar, contacts, to do list, and notes) as well as a long list of other applications. Support for handwriting recognition, on-screen keyboard, bluetooth, IrDA and add-on hardware such as keyboards are standard in both environments.

The v0.8.4 (2006-08-20) version supports HP iPAQ H3xxx and H5xxx series of handhelds, and introduced initial support for the HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and H6300 series.

===Intimate Linux===
On devices with added storage (primarily microdrives) there is a modified port of Debian called Intimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intimate (temporarily offline as of 12/2012)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a standard X11 desktop, Intimate also offered the Opie, GPE and Qtopia suites. (Qtopia was a QT-based PIM suite with an optional commercial license.)

===NetBSD===
NetBSD will install and run on iPAQ.

===Plan 9 from Bell Labs===
Plan 9 from Bell Labs runs on some iPAQs. The nickname of the architecture is &quot;bitsy,&quot; after the name of the ARM-based chipsets used in many of the machines. The &quot;Installation on Ipaq&quot; part of the wiki states: &quot;These instructions are for a Compaq Ipaq and have been tested only on models H3630 and H3650 with 32MB of RAM.&quot; In regards to iPAQs, the page on the wiki titled &quot;Supported PDAs&quot; only mentions that the &quot;H3630 and H3650 are known to work.&quot;

===Ångström distribution===
See Ångström distribution

==Upgrades==
The hx2000 series and some later models are upgradeable to newer versions of Windows Mobile. These upgrades could be purchased from HP. Windows Mobile 2003 could be installed on the H3950, H3970, h5450 models and possibly other models of the H3xxx series with sufficient ROM capacity. Other &quot;cooked&quot; (ready to run) roms have been provided by the group known as the xda-developers and are available for the hx2000 series, the hx4700 and others. The upgradeable versions for the hx2000 and hx4700 include Windows Mobile 6.0, 6.1 and 6.5 which are the newest releases of the Windows Mobile platform.

===Internal Li-ion battery===
iPAQ models 3100–3700 are fitted with internal Li-ion battery PN 167648 3.7 V 1500 mAh which can be replaced with a 2200 mAh unit. The same battery is used in the iPAQ jacket PN 173396-001 PCMCIA (PC port), which may also be upgraded to a 2200 mAh unit. The 3800/3900 series are fitted with a 1700 mAh cell as standard, also upgradeable to 2200 mAh. Compaq presumably upgraded the battery to cope with the faster CPU&#x27;s power requirements.

===RAM upgrades===
It is possible to have the internal RAM of an iPAQ H3970 and hx4700 upgraded to 128 MB by using a specialist service to replace the surface-mount BGA RAM chips.

<text>The 1809 Instrument of Government (), adopted on 6 June 1809 by the Riksdag of the Estates and King Charles XIII, was the constitution of the Kingdom of Sweden from 1809 to the end of 1974. It came about as a result of the Coup of 1809, in which King Gustav IV Adolf was deposed. The promulgation of the constitution marks the point at which Sweden transitioned from the absolute monarchy of the Gustavian era (established by a previous coup in 1772) into a stable, constitutional monarchy adhering to the rule of law and significant civil liberties. 

Initially the Instrument only curtailed the powers of the king, who retained a significant role in politics, but over time the crown&#x27;s powers were reduced still further by convention as Sweden developed into a full democracy.

The 1809 Instrument was finally replaced altogether by the Instrument of Government of 1974, which formally enshrined democracy and the will and equality of the people, exercised through a unicameral parliament.

==History==
After the promulgation of the Instrument of Government (1719), Sweden had a half-century of parliamentary government under the Riksdag of the Estates, a period traditionally known as the Age of Liberty. This came to an end with the Revolution of 1772, a self-coup perpetrated by Gustav III, who subsequently ruled as an enlightened despot under the 1772 Instrument of Government. Gustav III&#x27;s son, Gustav IV Adolf, succeeded him but proved a less charismatic ruler, and his political authority was fatally undermined by Swedish defeat in the Finnish War, part of the broader Napoleonic Wars, which led to the cession of Finland to Russia under the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. 

This military catastrophe provided an opportunity for disaffected liberals, backed by elements of the Swedish Army, to mount a coup against the unpopular king. Gustav Adolf was arrested, forced to abdicate and then sent into exile, and his uncle Duke Charles was acclaimed as King Charles XIII. Charles agreed to renounce absolute monarchy, and to accept the replacement of the absolutist Instrument of Government (1772) by a new constitution. The new constitution was drawn up by a committee led by Hans Järta, and was officially adopted by the Riksdag on 6 June, Sweden&#x27;s national day.

As Charles XIII was childless, it was vital to find an heir in order to guarantee a smooth succession upon his death. The Riksdag initially elected a Danish prince and Stadtholder of Norway, Charles August, but he died soon afterwards. In 1810 they therefore held a second election and chose the French Marshal and Prince of Pontecorvo Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who was adopted by Charles XIII and officially recognised as heir apparent. In order to prevent future succession crises, the rights of Bernadotte&#x27;s descendants to accede to the Swedish throne were codified in an amendment to the Instrument of Government, the Act of Succession (1810).

==Description==
The Instrument of Government established a separation of powers between the executive branch (the king) and the legislative branch (the Riksdag of the Estates). The King and Riksdag possessed joint power over legislation (article 87, constitutional law in articles 81-86), while the Riksdag had sole power over the budget and state incomes and expenses (articles 57-77) including military burdens (article 73). While the king&#x27;s power was somewhat reduced compared to the enlightened absolutism of Gustav III, the new document did allow the king to take a more active role in politics than the 1720 Instrument of Government which had been in force during the Age of Liberty.

Originally, ministers were politically responsible solely to the king, who appointed and dismissed them. However, they were legally responsible to the Riksdag and a special court (Riksrätten) according to a special statute and to law in general if they committed legal offences (articles 106 and 101-102).

==Later Reforms==
Although the Instrument of Government remained in force to the end of 1974, a large number of important reforms were made in the meantime which transformed the structures of Swedish government.

Under the Instrument, the Riksdag of the Estates initially retained the multicameral form it had had since the Middle Ages, comprising representatives of the four &quot;estates&quot; of Swedish society, namely the nobility, clergy, burghers and peasantry. However, in 1866 it was replaced by a new bicameral (two-chamber) legislature, the modern Riksdag, in which members of the &quot;First Chamber&quot; elected indirectly by the county councils and the municipal assemblies in the larger towns and cities, and members of the &quot;Second Chamber&quot; directly elected by male property owners.

A further important change came in 1876 with the creation of the office of Prime Minister of Sweden, reflecting practice in other parliamentary democracies such as the United Kingdom.

===Courtyard Crisis===

As the Riksdag&#x27;s authority grew, it became increasingly difficult for a government to stay in office solely with the Crown&#x27;s support. This tension grew especially bad after 1907, when a liberal government was chosen that enjoyed the confidence of the Riksdag but was disliked by King Gustav V. In 1914 the king made the so-called Courtyard Speech publicly criticising the government, which resigned in protest, whereupon the king appointed a conservative government of civil servants responsible to him.

The Liberals won a decisive victory in 1917, and although Gustaf nevertheless tried to appoint another conservative ministry, it could not garner enough support in the Riksdag. It was now obvious that the king could no longer pick a government entirely of his choosing, nor could he keep an unpopular ministry in office against the will of the Riksdag. Gustaf yielded and appointed a liberal-social democratic coalition that effectively arrogated most of the crown&#x27;s political powers to itself. 

This &quot;Courtyard Crisis&quot; definitively established that ministers were both politically and legally responsible to the Riksdag rather than the crown, and from then on, while ministers were still formally appointed by the king, convention required him to ensure they had the support of a majority in the Riksdag. Although the 1809 Instrument&#x27;s statement that &quot;the King alone shall govern the realm&quot; (article 4) remained unchanged, it was understood that he was to exercise his powers through the ministers and act on their advice. As a result, the ministers did most of the actual work of governing, making Sweden a de facto parliamentary monarchy.

==Replacement by the 1974 Instrument==
On 1 January 1975, the 1809 Instrument was replaced by a new Instrument of Government (1974), which stripped the king of even nominal political power and made Sweden a &quot;de facto&quot; crowned republic. but in the terms of Constitutional Monarchy as the form of government in Sweden according to the Constitution

<text>The Instrument of Government () of 1634 was a document describing the form and operation of the Swedish government, retrospectively regarded as the country&#x27;s first constitution, although it was not intended to function as such. It was composed by the Lord High Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, and was adopted by the Riksdag of the Estates (Swedish Parliament) on 29 July 1634. It was rendered void when the Riksdag repudiated it in 1680.

==Background==
After King Gustav II Adolf was killed at the Battle of Lützen (1632), the Swedish crown passed to his daughter, Christina. However, she was only five years old at the time, and so power was exercised in her name by the Council of the Realm. As the dominant figure on the Council was the Lord High Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, he therefore became the effective regent of Sweden. However, he was at the time out of the country, having been accompanying King Gustav on his campaigns in Germany, and he chose to remain in Mainz to direct military operations rather than returning to Sweden. Indeed, he did not come back to Sweden until 1636, and it was during this period of absence that he composed the Instrument of Government.

Oxenstierna&#x27;s primary purpose in drawing up the 1634 Instrument was not to effect a major change in Sweden&#x27;s form of government (as would be the case with the later Instruments of Government promulgated in 1719, 1772 and 1809), but rather to describe its existing structures and norms, and to clarify the division of responsibilities among different royal officials, in order to ensure that the regency government functioned smoothly in his absence.

==Description==
The Instrument of Government was the first attempt to systematically describe and regulate the structures of Swedish government and administration, as well as the judiciary and the armed forces. It also instituted a number of reforms, such as decreeing that the number of members of the Council of the Realm, hitherto an &quot;ad hoc&quot; gathering of the king&#x27;s advisors, was to be fixed at twenty-five (Article #5). It furthermore established that the Council was to be headed by the five Great Officers of the Realm; one of these was Oxenstierna himself (as Lord High Chancellor), while two others were kinsmen of his, namely his brother Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna (as Lord High Steward) and their cousin Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna (as Lord High Treasurer).

One of the Instrument&#x27;s most important reforms, and certainly the one that has had the most pervasive effect upon Swedish life since 1634, was the introduction of a system of counties () to replace the traditional provinces (Article #23). The counties have been rejigged several times in the centuries since, but remain the primary units of local government in Sweden to this day.

The Instrument largely ignored the role of the Crown in its description of the operation of the Swedish government, and indeed reassigned many functions which were usually discharged by the king to the Great Officers of the Realm instead. As Sven Nilsson says in his biography of Oxenstierna:

Obviously, this reflects in part the fact that the underage Queen Christina was incapable of taking an active role in government at the time the Instrument was written. However, it was intended from the beginning that the Instrument would apply not just during Christina’s minority but also after she came of age, and indeed during the reigns of subsequent monarchs. Oxenstierna stated as much in a letter of 5 December 1632, in which he described one purpose of the new document as being to ensure that “a wise king could be properly understood, and a foolish king not immediately deposed”,
i.e. that it would enable royal officials to prevent a wayward monarch from taking unwise actions that might provoke revolt.

==Reception==

The Instrument of Government was endorsed by the Riksdag of the Estates in July 1634 and subsequently applied across Sweden, although technically it did not have legal force as it was never formally confirmed by either Queen Christina or her successor King Charles X Gustav. Indeed, the latter strongly resented the restrictions it imposed upon his role in the government, and he used the Swedish defeat in the Dano-Swedish War (1658-1660) to argue that the current arrangement was inadequate. He therefore proposed to the 1660 session of the Riksdag that the Instrument be rewritten to give him greater freedom of action, but his efforts came to naught due to his sudden death in February of that year.

The Instrument thus remained in force &quot;de facto&quot; down to 1680, when Charles Gustav’s son Charles XI used the poor Swedish performance in another conflict, the Scanian War (1675-9), to revive his father’s argument that the only way to ensure the security of the Swedish Empire was by centralising power in the person of the monarch. The Riksdag was convinced, declaring on 1680 that the king &quot;was not to be bound by any instrument of government, only by the laws of Sweden&quot;, thereby rendering the Instrument of Government void and establishing an absolute monarchy in Sweden for the first time.

Despite the introduction of absolutism, Charles XI continued to implicitly accept many of the limits on royal power laid out in the Instrument of Government. His son and successor Charles XII was less sensitive, especially toward the end of his reign, when the strains imposed by the Great Northern War led him to rule in an increasingly high-handed and autocratic fashion. His arbitrary interference in the business of government and his refusal to take advice from his officials led to mounting frustration with the absolutist system, and after the king&#x27;s death in 1718 it was overthrown and replaced by a constitutional monarchy. The document drawn up to articulate the new system was inspired by the 1634 Instrument of Government, and was given the same title (see Instrument of Government (1719)), although it differed from its predecessor in that it was explicitly intended to function as a constitution.

<text>Magnus Magnentius ( 303 – 10 August 353) was a Roman general and usurper against Constantius II. Of Germanic descent, Magnentius served with distinction in Gaul under the emperor Constans. On 18 January 350 Magnentius was acclaimed &quot;Augustus&quot;. Quickly killing the unpopular Constans, Magnentius gained control over most of the Western Empire. The Eastern emperor Constantius II, the brother of Constans, refused to acknowledge Magnentius&#x27; legitimacy and led a successful campaign against Magnentius. Ultimately, Magnentius&#x27; forces were scattered after the Battle of Mons Seleucus, and he died by suicide on 10 August 353.

Much of Magnentius&#x27; short reign was concerned with asserting his legitimacy. Unlike Constans, Magnentius was unrelated to Constantine the Great, and so had no dynastic claim to the emperorship. Magnentius instead sought popular support by modeling himself as a liberator who had freed the Western Empire from the tyranny of Constans. He attempted various public and religious reform, but almost all his acts were quickly repealed by Constantius after his death. In light of the political instability of his reign, modern and ancient historians tend to consider him a usurper rather than an emperor.

Perhaps the most important consequence of Magnentius&#x27; revolt was the severe depletion of the Empire&#x27;s military forces in civil war: The Battle of Mursa left so many Roman soldiers dead that, according to Zosimus, Constantius feared that Rome would no longer be able to effectively hold off barbarian invasions. Following his death, Constantius II became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.

==Early life and accession==
Born in Samarobriva (Amiens), Gaul, Magnentius was purportedly the son of a British father and a Frankish mother, though some scholars suspect that his supposed origins were exaggerated or invented as a result of Constantinian propaganda. He served in the &quot;protectores&quot;, a prestigious bodyguard corps attached to the imperial retinue, and was promoted to &quot;comes&quot; of the Herculians and Jovians, the Imperial guard units. Magnentius seems to have been effective in his post and to have been well-liked by other important court officials, notably Marcellinus, the &quot;comes rerum privatarum&quot;, who supported his usurpation.

Court officials eventually hatched a plot to overthrow Constans and place Magnentius in power. By 350, Constans was likely deeply unpopular; ancient sources deride him as licentious, incompetent, and homosexual. There is confusion as to the details, but in Augustulum (Autun) on 18 January 350 Magnentius announced his bid for power by attending a dinner party, stepping out for a moment, and re-entering the room in a purple toga (the traditional dress of an emperor). The party-goers, either all or in part in on the plot, hailed him Augustus.

In the days following his acclamation, Magnentius bribed the city guard to secure their loyalty and barred residents of Augustulum from leaving the city to prevent the spread of the news. Anxious to eliminate Constans—who was then hunting near the Pyrenees away from his forces—Magnentius sent a contingent to run him down, and Constans was killed at Helena (near Perpignan). Zosimus claims this force was headed by Gaiso, and that his consulship in 351 was a reward for this act.

== Usurper ==

Magnentius quickly attracted the loyalty of the provinces of Britannia, Gaul, and Hispania, and immediately moved to control Italy. He did so within a month of his ascension, appointing Fabius Titianus to the position of &quot;praefectus urbis&quot; to govern Rome. He seems to have secured Africa quickly as well, thus inheriting all of Constans&#x27; former territory except Illyria (which would shortly come under the control of Vetranio).

Magnentius&#x27; early reign is marked by a series of bids for political legitimacy. Lacking a connection to the Constantinian dynasty, Magnentius married Justina, possibly a great-granddaughter of Constantine (and future wife of Valentinian). Magnentius attempted to create an image of himself as a liberator, and minted coins with such inscriptions as &#x27;liberator of the Roman world.&#x27; Further, Magnentius seems to have initially pursued a policy of diplomacy with Constantius, hoping to induce the emperor to recognize him officially: for the first six months of his reign, Magnentius spoke of Constantius as his senior and minted coins bearing his image. Magnentius also appealed to the controversial bishop Athanasius—who in the end chose to side with Constantius—and repealed some of Constans&#x27; restrictions on pagan sacrifice in Italy. This latter decision, aimed at winning the support of wealthy Italian pagans, proved to be a rather crude political maneuver, and earned Magnentius a reputation as a pagan himself.Despite his efforts Magnentius remained politically vulnerable. Constantius reasoned that legitimizing the man who murdered his brother would set an unacceptable precedent, and so prepared to march West. In Italy, Magnentius&#x27; hold over Rome proved tenuous, and Julius Nepotianus, Constantine&#x27;s nephew, took and held the city for 27 days. Magnentius dispatched Marcellinus (now promoted to &quot;magister officiorum&quot;) to retake the city. In Illyria, Vetranio was acclaimed emperor with the support of Constantius&#x27; sister Constantina on 1 March 350. Though he publicly allied with Magnentius, many modern scholars contend that Vetranio was working for Constantius from the beginning, preventing Magnentius from threatening Constantinople until Constantius could march West.

There is little evidence to suggest that Magnentius&#x27; rule was tyrannical or unjust. In a funeral oration for the emperor Julian, the orator Libanius concedes that Magnentius &quot;governed [the empire] in accordance with the laws.&quot; This, along with the speed with which he attracted the provinces of Britain and Hispania, may indicate that his administration was relatively competent.

== Civil war ==

By the summer of 350 it had become clear that war was inevitable between Constantius and Magnentius. Magnentius had already moved east over the spring, and appointed his brother Decentius as &quot;caesar&quot; to control Gaul during his absence. In the East, Constantius was tied down for most of 350 in his war against the Persians. However, in the autumn of 350 Constantius successfully lifted the Persian siege of Nisibis and forged a nominal peace with the Sasanids. Appointing Constantius Gallus &quot;caesar&quot; and entrusting command of the Eastern legions to Lucillianus, Constantius moved West. On 25 December 350 he accepted Vetranio’s resignation in Illyria.

Constantius and Magnentius wintered far apart, and, in the early months of 351, both parties flirted with the idea of peace. Constantius offered Magnentius control of Gaul, which Magnentius rejected. Magnentius&#x27; force may have been slowly deserting him, for he seems to have pushed for a battle: either the night before the battle or long before (accounts conflict) the important commander Silvanus defected to Constantius. After failing to take the city of Mursa, Magnentius&#x27; force was approached by Constantius&#x27;, and the Battle of Mursa Major ensued. Constantius won a Pyrrhic victory in one of the largest battles ever fought among Romans: low estimates suggest there were over 50,000 deaths. The sight of the field is reported to have reduced Constantius to tears, and to have made him fear that Rome would be unable to resist barbarian invasion. Contemporary commentators like Eutropius lament the waste of Roman soldiers, noting that enough men for an entire foreign invasion were lost.

==Demise==

Magnentius retreated across the Alps, perhaps after being prevented from entering Italy by the erection of garrisons loyal to Constantius. Magnentius blocked the passages West, and Constantius engaged in skirmishes with the barbarians to the Northeast for the rest of the year.

The year 352 is marked by Magnentius&#x27; failed attempts to broker a peace with Constantius: Magnentius sent an embassy to Constantius who, worried about espionage, prevented them reaching him. Magnentius then sent an assembly of bishops with the message that he was willing to step down and take a soldier&#x27;s posting under Constantius. Constantius rejected this offer as well. Magnentius&#x27; legions along the Rhine began defecting en masse, access to northern Gaul and Spain was blocked, and, in the end, he was unable to effectively prevent defection even in his camp.

At some time in the year 353, Magnentius may have attempted to assassinate Constantius Gallus, Constantius&#x27; &quot;caesar&quot;, in a bid to open the Eastern empire to attack. The incident is mentioned only in the account of Zonaras, though some scholars see a passage in Ammianus Marcellinus as corroborating it. However, some modern scholars have claimed that Zonaras&#x27; account contains chronological problems, and thus the historicity of this event is uncertain. In any case, if the plot did exist, it was foiled, as Gallus outlived the civil war.

Constantius crossed the Alps in 353, and Magnentius made a final stand in July of the same year at the Battle of Mons Seleucus, after which he fled to Lugdunum (Lyon). There, some sources report that his home was surrounded by the forces of Constantius and that he lashed out against his brother Desiderius. However, most sources agree that on 10 August 353 he died by suicide, falling on his sword. His brother Decentius hanged himself when he received the news.

Following the suppression of Magnentius&#x27; rebellion, Constantius began to root out his followers. The most notorious agent he employed in this search was the &quot;primicerius notariorum&quot; Paulus Catena (&quot;Paul the Chain&quot;).

== Religion ==
Magnentius&#x27; religious beliefs remain a point of contention among scholars. Many argue that Magnentius was, at least nominally, a Christian. However, some sources hint at a pagan restoration during his short reign. Epigraphic evidence suggests that he allowed pagans to perform sacrifices at night, a practice that had been banned by Constans. Philostorgius describes Magnentius as a demon worshiper, and Zonaras recounts a story of him using black magic. Numismatically, Magnentius&#x27; coinage is neither distinctively pagan nor Christian, with the exception of a series of coins bearing a Christogram. This symbol has come to be associated solely with Christianity, but this may not reflect attitudes at the time: MacMullen argues that Magnentius was a Pagan, and that the Chi-Rho had been so de-Christianized by the mid fourth century that he could use it freely.

<doc id="216472" wikidata="Q575400" url="?curid=216472" title="Sugar Ray">
<text>Sugar Ray is an American rock band formed in Newport Beach, California, in 1986. Originally playing heavier funk metal and nu metal style music, the band achieved mainstream popularity in 1997 with their more pop-influenced single &quot;Fly&quot;. The song&#x27;s success led the band to shift its style dramatically to the more radio-friendly pop sound with their subsequent releases. Their best-selling album, &quot;14:59&quot;, was released in 1999, and featured popular singles &quot;Every Morning&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, followed by a self-titled album in 2001 featuring the single &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot;. The band would release two further albums, &quot;In the Pursuit of Leisure&quot; (2003) and &quot;Music for Cougars&quot; (2009), though the albums and respective singles generally sold far less. The band continued to tour into the 2010s.

In 2019, ten years after the band&#x27;s last album, they announced their seventh studio album, &quot;Little Yachty&quot;, in June 2019. The lead single, &quot;Make It Easy&quot;, was released the same month.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; (1986–1996)===
The band members grew up in Orange County, California. Rodney Sheppard played in a number of reggae bands, including working with future Good Charlotte drummer Dean Butterworth. In the late 1980s, prior to Sugar Ray, Sheppard and Stan Frazier played together in a band under the name The Tories. Later additions Murphy Karges and Mark McGrath changed the band&#x27;s name to Shrinky Dinx (initially &quot;Shrinky Dinks&quot;). After signing with Atlantic Records, the name was changed to Sugar Ray upon threat of a lawsuit from the Milton Bradley Company, maker of the Shrinky Dinks toy.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, was released in 1995 and though it failed to produce a major hit single it did earn them recognition in alternative circles.

After they gained fame with the 1997 album &quot;Floored&quot; in 1998, the single &quot;Speed Home California&quot; and &quot;Mean Machine&quot; from &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; was featured in the PlayStation game &quot;Road Rash 3D&quot;, and its Nintendo 64 counterpart &quot;Road Rash 64&quot;, respectively.

===&quot;Floored&quot; (1997–1998)===
Sugar Ray&#x27;s first mainstream hit came in the summer of 1997 with their song &quot;Fly&quot;, which was released from the album &quot;Floored&quot; and featured reggae musician Super Cat. &quot;Fly&quot; did not sound anything at all like the rest of the tracks on the album and received frequent radio play, resulting in a number one rank on the Billboard&#x27;s Airplay List. As a result of the success of &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Floored&quot; sold well and was certified double platinum. By the end of 1997 critics were skeptical that Sugar Ray could put out another successful song and labeled them a one-hit wonder. The same year, Sugar Ray was featured in the movie &quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot;, starring Billy Crystal and Robin Williams.

===&quot;14:59&quot; (1999–2000)===
Their 1999 album &quot;14:59&quot; was the band&#x27;s reply to suggestions that they were a one-hit wonder, with the title implying that their 15 minutes of fame were not quite up — their &quot;fame clock&quot; read 14:59. &quot;Every Morning&quot;, which was widely compared to &quot;Fly&quot;, had similar success during the spring of 1999, reaching number 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. When asked about the band&#x27;s change of style to cash on their previous hit, bassist Murphy Karges said, &quot;We never had any credibility. Nobody ever gave us any so how could we lose any?&quot;

Their follow-up single &quot;Someday&quot; also enjoyed extensive airplay later that year and reached number 7 in the U.S. The next follow-up single &quot;Falls Apart (Run Away)&quot; reached number 29 in early 2000. &quot;14:59&quot; outsold its predecessor and was certified triple platinum. The band toured in support of the album, and were scheduled to perform at Woodstock 99 but McGrath fell ill and they had to cancel. After &quot;14:59&quot; in 2000, Sugar Ray teamed up with The Alkaholiks to contribute the track &quot;Make Room&quot; on the Rap Rock collaboration album, &quot;Loud Rocks&quot;, with other artists with a similar style such as Crazy Town and Incubus. In 2000, Sugar Ray did a cover version of John Cale and Brian Eno&#x27;s song &quot;Spinning Away&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Beach&quot;.

===&quot;Sugar Ray&quot; (2001–2002)===
Their 2001 self-titled album &quot;Sugar Ray&quot; produced another hit with &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, which, although it failed to achieve the same level of success as their previous singles, still reached number 13 in the U.S. Other singles such as &quot;Answer the Phone&quot;, &quot;Under the Sun&quot; and &quot;Words to Me&quot; gained some popularity as well. Sugar Ray also made several movie appearances, including &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; in 2002. 

===&quot;In the Pursuit of Leisure&quot; (2003–2005)===
Sugar Ray&#x27;s 2003 effort &quot;In the Pursuit of Leisure&quot;, and the first single from the album, &quot;Mr. Bartender (It&#x27;s So Easy)&quot;, received a lukewarm reception. The album also contained the band&#x27;s cover of Joe Jackson&#x27;s famous &quot;Is She Really Going Out With Him?&quot;. ProHoeZak guested live with the band in 2003 having appeared on &quot;Mr. Bartender (It&#x27;s So Easy)&quot;. In 2005, Sugar Ray released a greatest hits album, with three new songs, &quot;Shot of Laughter&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, and &quot;Psychedelic Bee&quot;.

===Inactivity and &quot;Music for Cougars&quot; (2006–2009)===
After releasing their greatest hits album – &quot;The Best of Sugar Ray&quot;, in 2005, the band went into a period of relative inactivity for a number of years, with Mark McGrath starting a new job as an anchor on the television show &quot;Extra&quot;. In January 2006, Sugar Ray was released from their recording contract with Atlantic Records. In mid-2007, their previously unreleased song &quot;Into Yesterday&quot; was used on the &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; movie soundtrack, and the band made brief tour in Asia in August 2007 where they headlined SingFest, Singapore&#x27;s first international music festival.

Sugar Ray appeared on the May 18, 2008, season 3 finale of &quot;American Dad!&quot;, titled &quot;Spring Break-Up&quot;, as themselves, playing &quot;Fly&quot; at a Spring Break party.

On May 19, 2008, the band announced they would be entering the studio to record their first album of new material since 2003. Jason Bernard, a friend of the band (who also happened to be a music producer) brought them a deal to sign with his label. It was announced that the band signed Pulse Recordings and that the new album should be released in the summer of 2009. On March 6, 2009, Mark McGrath announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Music for Cougars&quot;. It was released on July 21, 2009. The first single was &quot;Boardwalk&quot;.

Some critics noted that McGrath aimed to lower people&#x27;s expectations for the album during its promotion by saying things like: &quot;I know people aren&#x27;t sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for a Sugar Ray album, but that wasn&#x27;t the point.&quot;

===Lineup changes and 1990s nostalgia touring (2010–2017)===
On August 22, 2010, Sugar Ray&#x27;s Twitter page announced that Craig &quot;DJ Homicide&quot; Bullock had left the band. In 2011, the band had what McGrath described as not &quot;the highest-grossing year for Sugar Ray&quot;. Murphy Karges and Stan Frazier also left, one not wanting to tour anymore, and the other taking a job with Aaron Rodgers. This left Rodney Sheppard and McGrath as the remaining original members. The band recruited replacements in percussionist Al Keith, bassist Justin Bivona and drummer Jesse Bivona, the latter two being touring support members in the past. 

In 2012, McGrath worked with Art Alexakis, frontman and vocalist of the band Everclear, on starting up a 1990s nostalgia tour, something they had discussed in the past but had always felt was too soon to be successful. The result was the &quot;Summerland&quot; tour, featuring a line-up of alternative rock bands that &quot;at least had a big hit or two&quot; in the 1990s, containing McGrath and Alexakis&#x27;s own bands along with Marcy Playground, Gin Blossoms, and Lit. Percussionist Al Keith (Khalil Al-Rashad) injured his foot on July 2, 2012 at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, during the song &quot;Fly&quot;. He was absent from shows until August 2012. The tour was deemed a success, and McGrath initially spoke of the possibility of it becoming a yearly event. Initial plans to expand the nostalgia touring into 2013 faced issues. McGrath announced a &quot;Mark McGrath &amp; Friends&quot; tour, in which the band would perform alongside other 1990s alternative rock bands Smash Mouth, Spin Doctors, and Vertical Horizon, on a cruise ship. though the plans were cancelled, with the idea losing support after the Carnival Triumph cruise ship disaster. Additionally, McGrath and Alexakis did not see eye to eye on the future direction for the &quot;Summerland&quot; tour, leading to Sugar Ray leaving its 2013 incarnation in favor of starting their own rival nostalgia tour called &quot;Under the Sun&quot; instead. The tour ran three separate years – 2013, 2014, and 2015.

As early as 2013, McGrath spoke of recording and releasing an EP, though at the time, he was unsure if it would be released as a band release or a solo release. On April 9, 2013, Mark McGrath announced via Twitter that he would be &quot;heading to Pulse Recording Studios&quot; to record the new material, he stated July to be a hopeful release date. For the tour, and drummer Jesse Bivona and bassist Justin Bivona were temporarily replaced by drummer Dean Butterworth and bassist Serg Dimitrijevic, as the Bivona brothers&#x27; band The Interrupters are opening for Rancid. On September 9, 2013, former members Stan Frazier (drums, percussion, programming, backing vocals) and Murphy Karges (bass guitar, backing vocals) performed with Scott Foster (lead vocals, guitar), Lewis Richards (guitar, backing vocals), and Damon Tucker (guitar, backing vocals) during Keep Calm and Beat H.E.A.T. Rocking &amp; Rally. They performed some of Foster&#x27;s solo material, and some Sugar Ray classics. They performed from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at Twila Reid Park, 3100 West Orange Avenue, Anaheim. On November 9, 2013, Sugar Ray was to play a benefit for the Greater Los Angeles Fisher House
at West LA&#x27;s Wadsworth Theater.

The band continued its &quot;Under the Sun&quot; tour through 2014. However, in June 2014, McGrath revealed that the band had been struggling with legal wranglings with Karges and Frazier since their departure in 2012, and that because of it, he felt there would never be another Sugar Ray album. McGrath would later release the EP as a solo EP entitled &quot;Summertime&#x27;s Coming&quot; in 2015. As of the fall of 2014, drummer Jesse Bivona and bassist Justin Bivona are no longer in Sugar Ray (leaving officially in 2016); drummer Dean Butterworth became a full member in fall 2014, while bassist Kristian Attard became a full member in 2016.

In August 2017, McGrath spoke of writing and recording another album, which he hoped he would be able to release within the next year.

===&quot;Little Yachty&quot; (2019–present)===
In June 2019, ten years after the band last released music, Sugar Ray signed with BMG Rights Management and announced a new album, &quot;Little Yachty&quot;; with the lead single &quot;Make it Easy&quot; debuting on June 7, 2019. The album title is a reference to both the rapper Lil Yachty and the fact that McGrath views Sugar Ray as a &quot;yacht rock&quot; band. The album was released on July 26, 2019.

==Musical style==
Sugar Ray originally began their career as a hardcore punk band, before introducing a DJ into the band&#x27;s musical composition, resulting in their first shift in style. This new sound fused glam metal and hardcore punk with funk, sample-based hip-hop, new wave, disco, dub, reggae, R&amp;B and soul music. This sound has been predominantly categorized as nu metal and funk metal, as well as alternative metal, hard rock, punk rock and rap metal. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine says that after the success of their crossover hit &quot;Fly&quot; they &quot;no longer tried to ape the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; Regarding the band&#x27;s first two albums, singer Mark McGrath stated, &quot;we were the Chili Peppers with zero talent. [...] Out of necessity we kind of became known as a metal band, a little pre nu-metal type rap rock thing before there was rap rock.&quot;

Sugar Ray shifted to a pop rock sound following the mainstream success of &quot;Fly&quot;, beginning with their third album &quot;14:59&quot;. The band&#x27;s later music has also been categorized as skate punk, pop, and alternative pop. The band&#x27;s new sound occasionally incorporated elements of genres such as power pop and disco. The band&#x27;s overall sound, throughout its shifts in style, has been characterized as alternative rock. The band&#x27;s music is generally tongue-in-cheek.

<text>Real options valuation, also often termed real options analysis, (ROV or ROA) applies option valuation techniques to capital budgeting decisions. A real option itself, is the right—but not the obligation—to undertake certain business initiatives, such as deferring, abandoning, expanding, staging, or contracting a capital investment project. For example, real options valuation could examine the opportunity to invest in the expansion of a firm&#x27;s factory and the alternative option to sell the factory.

==Scope==
Real options are generally distinguished from conventional financial options in that they are not typically traded as securities, and do not usually involve decisions on an underlying asset that is traded as a financial security. A further distinction is that option holders here, i.e. management, can directly influence the value of the option&#x27;s underlying project; whereas this is not a consideration regarding the underlying security of a financial option. Moreover, management cannot measure uncertainty in terms of volatility, and must instead rely on their perceptions of uncertainty. Unlike financial options, management must also create or discover real options, and such creation and discovery process comprises an entrepreneurial or business task. Real options are most valuable when uncertainty is high; management has significant flexibility to change the course of the project in a favorable direction and is willing to exercise the options.

Real options analysis, as a discipline, extends from its application in corporate finance, to decision making under uncertainty in general, adapting the techniques developed for financial options to &quot;real-life&quot; decisions. For example, R&amp;D managers can use real options valuation to help them deal with various uncertainties in making decisions about the allocation of resources among R&amp;D projects. Non-business examples might be evaluating the cost of cryptocurrency mining machines, or the decision to join the work force, or rather, to forgo several years of income to attend graduate school. It, thus, forces decision makers to be explicit about the assumptions underlying their projections, and for this reason ROV is increasingly employed as a tool in business strategy formulation. This extension of real options to real-world projects often requires customized decision support systems, because otherwise the complex compound real options will become too intractable to handle.

==Types of real options==
The flexibility available to management – i.e. the actual &quot;real options&quot; – generically, will relate to project size, project timing, and the operation of the project once established. In all cases, any (non-recoverable) upfront expenditure related to this flexibility is the option premium. Real options are also commonly applied to stock valuation - see - as well as to various other &quot;Applications&quot; referenced below.

===Options relating to project size===
Where the project&#x27;s scope is uncertain, flexibility as to the size of the relevant facilities is valuable, and constitutes optionality.

*Option to expand: Here the project is built with capacity in excess of the expected level of output so that it can produce at higher rates if needed. Management then has the option (but not the obligation) to expand – i.e. exercise the option – should conditions turn out to be favourable. A project with the option to expand will cost more to establish, the excess being the option premium, but is worth more than the same without the possibility of expansion. This is equivalent to a call option.
*Option to contract: The project is engineered such that output can be contracted in future should conditions turn out to be unfavourable. Forgoing these future expenditures constitutes option exercise. This is the equivalent to a put option, and again, the excess upfront expenditure is the option premium.
*Option to expand or contract: Here the project is designed such that its operation can be dynamically turned on and off. Management may shut down part or all of the operation when conditions are unfavorable (a put option), and may restart operations when conditions improve (a call option). A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a good example of this type of option. This option is also known as a Switching option.

===Options relating to project life and timing===
Where there is uncertainty as to when, and how, business or other conditions will eventuate, flexibility as to the timing of the relevant project(s) is valuable, and constitutes optionality.
*Growth options: perhaps the most generic in this category – these entail the call option to exercise only those projects that appear to be profitable at the time of initiation.
*Initiation or deferment options: Here management has flexibility as to when to start a project. For example, in natural resource exploration a firm can delay mining a deposit until market conditions are favorable. This constitutes an American styled call option.
*Delay option with a product patent: A firm with a patent right on a product has a right to develop and market the product exclusively until the expiration of the patent. The firm will market and develop the product only if the present value of the expected cash flows from the product sales exceeds the cost of development. If this does not occur, the firm can shelve the patent and not incur any further costs.
*Option to abandon: Management may have the option to cease a project during its life, and, possibly, to realise its salvage value. Here, when the present value of the remaining cash flows falls below the liquidation value, the asset may be sold, and this act is effectively the exercising of a put option. This option is also known as a Termination option. Abandonment options are American styled.
*Sequencing options: This option is related to the initiation option above, although entails flexibility as to the timing of more than one inter-related projects: the analysis here is as to whether it is advantageous to implement these sequentially or in parallel. Here, observing the outcomes relating to the first project, the firm can resolve some of the uncertainty relating to the venture overall. Once resolved, management has the option to proceed or not with the development of the other projects. If taken in parallel, management would have already spent the resources and the value of the option not to spend them is lost. The sequencing of projects is an important issue in corporate strategy. Related here is also the notion of Intraproject vs. Interproject options.
===Options relating to project operation===
Management may have flexibility relating to the product produced and/or the process used in manufacture. As in the preceding cases, this flexibility increases the value of the project, corresponding in turn, to the &quot;premium&quot; paid for the real option.
*Output mix options: The option to produce different outputs from the same facility is known as an output mix option or product flexibility. These options are particularly valuable in industries where demand is volatile or where quantities demanded in total for a particular good are typically low, and management would wish to change to a different product quickly if required.
*Input mix options: An input mix option – process flexibility – allows management to use different inputs to produce the same output as appropriate. For example, a farmer will value the option to switch between various feed sources, preferring to use the cheapest acceptable alternative. An electric utility, for example, may have the option to switch between various fuel sources to produce electricity, and therefore a flexible plant, although more expensive may actually be more valuable.
*Operating scale options: Management may have the option to change the output rate per unit of time or to change the total length of production run time, for example in response to market conditions. These options are also known as Intensity options.

==Valuation==
Given the above, it is clear that there is an analogy between real options and financial options, and we would therefore expect options-based modelling and analysis to be applied here. At the same time, it is nevertheless important to understand why the more standard valuation techniques may not be applicable for ROV.

===Applicability of standard techniques===
ROV is often contrasted with more standard techniques of capital budgeting, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis / net present value (NPV). Under this &quot;standard&quot; NPV approach, future expected cash flows are present valued under the empirical probability measure at a discount rate that reflects the embedded risk in the project; see CAPM, APT, WACC. Here, only the expected cash flows are considered, and the &quot;flexibility&quot; to alter corporate strategy in view of actual market realizations is &quot;ignored&quot;; see below as well as . The NPV framework (implicitly) assumes that management is &quot;passive&quot; with regard to their Capital Investment once committed. Some analysts account for this uncertainty by (i) adjusting the discount rate, e.g. by increasing the cost of capital, or (ii) adjusting the cash flows, e.g. using certainty equivalents, or (iii) applying (subjective) &quot;haircuts&quot; to the forecast numbers, or (iv) via probability-weighting these as in rNPV. Even when employed, however, these latter methods do not normally properly account for changes in risk over the project&#x27;s lifecycle and hence fail to appropriately adapt the risk adjustment. 

By contrast, ROV assumes that management is &quot;active&quot; and can &quot;continuously&quot; respond to market changes. Real options consider &quot;all&quot; scenarios (or &quot;states&quot;) and indicate the best corporate action in each of these contingent events. Because management adapts to each negative outcome by decreasing its exposure and to positive scenarios by scaling up, the firm benefits from uncertainty in the underlying market, achieving a lower variability of profits than under the commitment/NPV stance. The contingent nature of future profits in real option models is captured by employing the techniques developed for financial options in the literature on contingent claims analysis. Here the approach, known as risk-neutral valuation, consists in adjusting the probability distribution for risk consideration, while discounting at the risk-free rate. This technique is also known as the &quot;martingale&quot; approach, and uses a risk-neutral measure. For technical considerations here, see below. For related discussion and graphical representation see Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation.

Given these different treatments, the real options value of a project is typically higher than the NPV – and the difference will be most marked in projects with major flexibility, contingency, and volatility. As for financial options, a higher volatility of the underlying leads to a higher value. An application of real options valuation in the Philippine banking industry exhibited that increased levels of income volatility may adversely affect option values on the loan portfolio, when the presence of information asymmetry is considered. In this case, increased volatility may limit the value of an option. Part of the criticism and subsequently slow adoption of real options valuation in practice and academia stems from the generally higher values for underlying assets these functions generate. However, studies have shown that these models are reliable estimators of underlying asset value, when input values are properly identified. 

===Options based valuation===
Although there is much similarity between the modelling of real options and financial options, ROV is distinguished from the latter, in that it takes into account uncertainty about the future evolution of the parameters that determine the value of the project, &quot;coupled with&quot; management&#x27;s ability to respond to the evolution of these parameters. It is the combined effect of these that makes ROV technically more challenging than its alternatives.

When valuing the real option, the analyst must therefore consider the inputs to the valuation, the valuation method employed, and whether any technical limitations may apply. Conceptually, valuing a real option looks at the premium between inflows and outlays for a particular project. Inputs to the value of a real option (time, discount rates, volatility, cash inflows and outflows) are each affected by the terms of business, and external environmental factors that a project exists in. Terms of business as information regarding ownership, data collection costs, and patents, are formed in relation to political, environmental, socio-cultural, technological, environmental and legal factors that affect an industry. Just as terms of business are affected by external environmental factors, these same circumstances affect the volatility of returns, as well as the discount rate (as firm or project specific risk). Furthermore, the external environmental influences that affect an industry affect projections on expected inflows and outlays.

====Valuation inputs====
Given the similarity in valuation approach, the inputs required for modelling the real option correspond, generically, to those required for a financial option valuation. The specific application, though, is as follows:

* The option&#x27;s underlying is the project in question – it is modelled in terms of:
** Spot price: the starting or current value of the project is required: this is usually based on management&#x27;s &quot;best guess&quot; as to the gross value of the project&#x27;s cash flows and resultant NPV;
** Volatility: a measure for uncertainty as to the change in value over time is required:
*** the volatility in project value is generally used, usually derived via monte carlo simulation; sometimes the volatility of the first period&#x27;s cash flows are preferred; see further under Corporate finance for a discussion relating to the estimation of NPV and project volatility.
*** some analysts substitute a listed security as a proxy, using either its price volatility (historical volatility), or, if options exist on this security, their implied volatility.
**Dividends generated by the underlying asset: As part of a project, the dividend equates to any income which could be derived from the real assets and paid to the owner. These reduce the appreciation of the asset.
* Option characteristics:
** Strike price: this corresponds to any (non-recoverable) investment outlays, typically the prospective costs of the project. In general, management would proceed (i.e. the option would be in the money) given that the present value of expected cash flows exceeds this amount;
** Option term: the time during which management may decide to act, or not act, corresponds to the life of the option. As above, examples include the time to expiry of a patent, or of the mineral rights for a new mine. See Option time value. Note though that given the flexibility related to timing as described, caution must be applied here.
** Option style and option exercise. Management&#x27;s ability to respond to changes in value is modeled at each decision point as a series of options, as above these may comprise, i.a.:
*** the option to contract the project (an American styled put option);
*** the option to abandon the project (also an American put);
*** the option to expand or extend the project (both American styled call options);
*** switching options or composite options which may also apply to the project.

====Valuation methods====
The valuation methods usually employed, likewise, are adapted from techniques developed for valuing financial options. Note though that, in general, while most &quot;real&quot; problems allow for American style exercise at any point (many points) in the project&#x27;s life and are impacted by multiple underlying variables, the standard methods are limited either with regard to dimensionality, to early exercise, or to both. In selecting a model, therefore, analysts must make a trade off between these considerations; see . The model must also be flexible enough to allow for the relevant decision rule to be coded appropriately at each decision point.

* Closed form, Black–Scholes-like solutions are sometimes employed. These are applicable only for European styled options or perpetual American options. Note that this application of Black–Scholes assumes constant — i.e. deterministic — costs: in cases where the project&#x27;s costs, like its revenue, are also assumed stochastic, then Margrabe&#x27;s formula can (should) be applied instead, here valuing the option to &quot;exchange&quot; expenses for revenue. (Relatedly, where the project is exposed to two (or more) uncertainties — e.g. for natural resources, price and quantity — some analysts attempt to use an overall volatility; this, though, is more correctly treated as a rainbow option, typically valued using simulation as below.)
* The most commonly employed methods are binomial lattices. These are more widely used given that most real options are American styled. Additionally, and particularly, lattice-based models allow for flexibility as to exercise, where the relevant, and differing, rules may be encoded at each node. Note that lattices cannot readily handle high-dimensional problems; treating the project&#x27;s costs as stochastic would add (at least) one dimension to the lattice, increasing the number of ending-nodes by the square (the exponent here, corresponding to the number of sources of uncertainty).
* Specialised Monte Carlo Methods have also been developed and are increasingly, and especially, applied to high-dimensional problems. Note that for American styled real options, this application is somewhat more complex; although recent research combines a least squares approach with simulation, allowing for the valuation of real options which are both multidimensional and American styled; see .
* When the Real Option can be modelled using a partial differential equation, then Finite difference methods for option pricing are sometimes applied. Although many of the early ROV articles discussed this method, its use is relatively uncommon today—particularly amongst practitioners—due to the required mathematical sophistication; these too cannot readily be used for high-dimensional problems.

Various other methods, aimed mainly at s, have been developed for real option valuation. These typically use cash-flow scenarios for the projection of the future pay-off distribution, and are not based on restricting assumptions similar to those that underlie the closed form (or even numeric) solutions discussed. Recent additions include 
the Datar–Mathews method (which can be understood as an extension of the net present value multi-scenario Monte Carlo model with an adjustment for risk aversion and economic decision-making), 
the fuzzy pay-off method, 
and the simulation with optimized exercise thresholds method.

By contrast, methods focusing on, for example, real option valuation in engineering design may be more sophisticated. These include analytics based on decision rules, which merge physical design considerations and management decisions through an intuitive &quot;if-then-else&quot; statement e.g., &quot;if&quot; demand is higher than a certain production capacity level, &quot;then&quot; expand existing capacity, &quot;else&quot; do nothing; this approach can be combined with advanced mathematical optimization methods like stochastic programming and robust optimisation to find the optimal design and decision rule variables. A more recent approach reformulates the real option problem as a data-driven Markov decision process, and uses advanced machine learning like deep reinforcement learning to evaluate a wide range of possible real option and design implementation strategies, well suited for complex systems and investment projects. 
These help quantify the value of flexibility engineered early on in system designs and/or irreversible investment projects. The methods help rank order flexible design solutions relative to one another, and thus enable the best real option strategies to be exercised cost effectively during operations. These methods have been applied in many use cases in aerospace, defense, energy, transport, space, and water infrastructure design and planning.

==Limitations==
The relevance of Real options, even as a thought framework, may be limited due to market, organizational and / or technical considerations. When the framework is employed, therefore, the analyst must first ensure that ROV is relevant to the project in question. These considerations are as follows.

===Market characteristics===
As discussed above, the market and environment underlying the project must be one where &quot;change is most evident&quot;, and the &quot;source, trends and evolution&quot; in product demand and supply, create the &quot;flexibility, contingency, and volatility&quot; 
which result in optionality. Without this, the NPV framework would be more relevant.

===Organizational considerations===
Real options are &quot;particularly important for businesses with a few key characteristics&quot;, and may be less relevant otherwise. In overview, it is important to consider the following in determining that the RO framework is applicable:
#Corporate strategy has to be adaptive to contingent events. Some corporations face organizational rigidities and are unable to react to market changes; in this case, the NPV approach is appropriate.
# Practically, the business must be positioned such that it has appropriate information flow, and opportunities to act. This will often be a market leader and / or a firm enjoying economies of scale and scope.
# Management must understand options, be able to identify and create them, and appropriately exercise them. This contrasts with business leaders focused on maintaining the status quo and / or near-term accounting earnings.
# The financial position of the business must be such that it has the ability to fund the project as, and when, required (i.e. issue shares, absorb further debt and / or use internally generated cash flow); see Financial statement analysis. Management must, correspondingly, have appropriate access to this capital.
# Management must be in the position to exercise, in so far as some real options are proprietary (owned or exercisable by a single individual or a company) while others are shared (can (only) be exercised by many parties).

===Technical considerations===
Limitations as to the use of these models arise due to the contrast between Real Options and financial options, for which these were originally developed.
The main difference is that the underlying is often not tradable – e.g. the factory owner cannot easily sell the factory upon which he has the option. Additionally, the real option itself may also not be tradeable – e.g. the factory owner cannot sell the right to extend his factory to another party, only he can make this decision (some real options, however, can be sold, e.g., ownership of a vacant lot of land is a real option to develop that land in the future). Even where a market exists – for the underlying or for the option – in most cases there is limited (or no) market liquidity. Finally, even if the firm can actively adapt to market changes, it remains to determine the right paradigm to discount future claims

The difficulties, are then:

# As above, data issues arise as far as estimating key model inputs. Here, since the value or price of the underlying cannot be (directly) observed, there will always be some (much) uncertainty as to its value (i.e. spot price) and volatility (further complicated by uncertainty as to management&#x27;s actions in the future).
# It is often difficult to capture the rules relating to exercise, and consequent actions by management. Further, a project may have a portfolio of embedded real options, some of which may be mutually exclusive.
# Theoretical difficulties, which are more serious, may also arise.
::*Option pricing models are built on rational pricing logic. Here, essentially: (a) it is presupposed that one can create a &quot;hedged portfolio&quot; comprising one option and &quot;delta&quot; shares of the underlying. (b) Arbitrage arguments then allow for the option&#x27;s price to be estimated today; see . (c) When hedging of this sort is possible, since delta hedging and risk neutral pricing are &quot;mathematically&quot; identical, then risk neutral valuation may be applied, as is the case with most option pricing models. (d) Under ROV however, the option and (usually) its underlying are clearly not traded, and forming a hedging portfolio would be difficult, if not impossible.
::*Standard option models: (a) Assume that the risk characteristics of the underlying do not change over the life of the option, usually expressed via a constant volatility assumption. (b) Hence a standard, risk free rate may be applied as the discount rate at each decision point, allowing for risk neutral valuation. Under ROV, however: (a) managements&#x27; actions actually change the risk characteristics of the project in question, and hence (b) the Required rate of return could differ depending on what state was realised, and a premium over risk free would be required, invalidating (technically) the risk neutrality assumption.

These issues are addressed via several interrelated assumptions:

# As discussed above, the data issues are usually addressed using a simulation of the project, or a listed proxy. Various new methods – see for example those described above – also address these issues.
# Also as above, specific exercise rules can often be accommodated by coding these in a bespoke binomial tree; see:.
# The theoretical issues:
::*To use standard option pricing models here, despite the difficulties relating to rational pricing, practitioners adopt the &quot;fiction&quot; that the real option and the underlying project are both traded: the so called, Marketed Asset Disclaimer (MAD) approach. Although this is a strong assumption, it is pointed out that a similar fiction in fact underpins standard NPV / DCF valuation (and using simulation as above). See: and.
::*To address the fact that changing characteristics invalidate the use of a constant discount rate, some analysts use the &quot;replicating portfolio approach&quot;, as opposed to Risk neutral valuation, and modify their models correspondingly. Under this approach, (a) we &quot;replicate&quot; the cash flows on the option by holding a risk free bond and the underlying in the correct proportions. Then, (b) since the cash flows of the option and the portfolio will &quot;always&quot; be identical, by arbitrage arguments their values may (must) be equated &quot;today&quot;, and (c) &quot;no&quot; discounting is required. (For an alternative, modifying Black-Scholes, see:.)

==History==
Whereas business managers have been making capital investment decisions for centuries, the term &quot;real option&quot; is relatively new, and was coined by Professor Stewart Myers of the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1977. In 1930, Irving Fisher wrote explicitly of the &quot;options&quot; available to a business owner (&quot;The Theory of Interest&quot;, II.VIII). The description of such opportunities as &quot;real options&quot;, however, followed on the development of analytical techniques for financial options, such as Black–Scholes in 1973. As such, the term &quot;real option&quot; is closely tied to these option methods.

Real options are today an active field of academic research. Professor Lenos Trigeorgis has been a leading name for many years, publishing several influential books and academic articles. Other pioneering academics in the field include Professors Michael Brennan, Eduardo Schwartz, Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck (the latter two, authoring the pioneering text in the discipline). An academic conference on real options is organized yearly (Annual International Conference on Real Options).

Amongst others, the concept was &quot;popularized&quot; by Michael J. Mauboussin, then chief U.S. investment strategist for Credit Suisse First Boston. He uses real options to explain the gap between how the stock market prices some businesses and the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; for those businesses. Trigeorgis also has broadened exposure to real options through layman articles in publications such as The Wall Street Journal. This popularization is such that ROV is now a standard offering in postgraduate finance degrees, and often, even in MBA curricula at many Business Schools.

Recently, real options have been employed in business strategy, both for valuation purposes and as a conceptual framework. The idea of treating strategic investments as options was popularized by Timothy Luehrman in two HBR articles: &quot;In financial terms, a business strategy is much more like a series of options, than a series of static cash flows&quot;. Investment opportunities are plotted in an &quot;option space&quot; with dimensions &quot;volatility&quot; &amp; value-to-cost (&quot;NPVq&quot;).

Luehrman also co-authored with William Teichner a Harvard Business School case study, &quot;Arundel Partners: The Sequel Project&quot;, in 1992, which may have been the first business school case study to teach ROV. Reflecting the &quot;mainstreaming&quot; of ROV, Professor Robert C. Merton discussed the essential points of Arundel in his Nobel Prize Lecture in 1997. Arundel involves a group of investors that is considering acquiring the sequel rights to a portfolio of yet-to-be released feature films. In particular, the investors must determine the value of the sequel rights before any of the first films are produced. Here, the investors face two main choices. They can produce an original movie and sequel at the same time &quot;or&quot; they can wait to decide on a sequel after the original film is released. The second approach, he states, provides the option &quot;not&quot; to make a sequel in the event the original movie is not successful. This real option has economic worth and can be valued monetarily using an option-pricing model. See Option (filmmaking).

<doc id="216476" wikidata="Q426971" url="?curid=216476" title="Economic value added">
<text>In accounting, as part of financial statements analysis, economic value added is an estimate of a firm&#x27;s economic profit, or the value created in excess of the required return of the company&#x27;s shareholders. EVA is the net profit less the capital charge ($) for raising the firm&#x27;s capital. The idea is that value is created when the return on the firm&#x27;s economic capital employed exceeds the cost of that capital. This amount can be determined by making adjustments to GAAP accounting. There are potentially over 160 adjustments but in practice, only several key ones are made, depending on the company and its industry.

==Calculation==
EVA is net operating profit after taxes (or NOPAT) less a capital charge, the latter being the product of the cost of capital and the economic capital. The basic formula is:

:formula_1

where:

*formula_2 is the return on invested capital;
*formula_3 is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC);
*formula_4is the economic capital employed (total assets − current liability);
*NOPAT is the net operating profit after tax, with adjustments and translations, generally for the amortization of goodwill, the capitalization of brand advertising and other non-cash items.

EVA calculation:

&quot;EVA = net operating profit after taxes – a capital charge&quot; [the residual income method]

therefore EVA = NOPAT – (&quot;c&quot; × capital), or alternatively

: EVA = (&quot;r&quot; × capital) – (&quot;c&quot; × capital) so that

: EVA = (&quot;r&quot; − &quot;c&quot;) × capital&quot; [the spread method, or excess return method]

where
: &quot;r&quot; = rate of return, and
: &quot;c&quot; = cost of capital, or the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

NOPAT is profits derived from a company&#x27;s operations after cash taxes but before financing costs and non-cash bookkeeping entries. It is the total pool of profits available to provide a cash return to those who provide capital to the firm.

Capital is the amount of cash invested in the business, net of depreciation. It can be calculated as the sum of interest-bearing debt and equity or as the sum of net assets less non-interest-bearing current liabilities (NIBCLs).

The capital charge is the cash flow required to compensate investors for the riskiness of the business given the amount of economic capital invested.

The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return on capital required to compensate investors (debt and equity) for bearing risk, their opportunity cost.

Another perspective on EVA can be gained by looking at a firm&#x27;s return on net assets (RONA). RONA is a ratio that is calculated by dividing a firm&#x27;s NOPAT by the amount of capital it employs (RONA = NOPAT/Capital) after making the necessary adjustments to the data reported by a conventional financial accounting system.

: EVA = (RONA – required minimum return) × net investments

If RONA is above the threshold rate, EVA is positive.

==Comparison with other approaches==
Other approaches along similar lines include residual income valuation (RI) and residual cash flow. Although EVA is similar to residual income, under some definitions there may be minor technical differences between EVA and RI (for example, adjustments that might be made to NOPAT before it is suitable for the formula below). Residual cash flow is another, much older term for economic profit. In all three cases, &quot;money cost of capital&quot; refers to the amount of money rather than the proportional cost (% cost of capital); at the same time, the adjustments to NOPAT are unique to EVA.

Although in concept, these approaches are in a sense nothing more than the traditional, commonsense idea of &quot;profit&quot;, the utility of having a more precise term such as EVA is that it makes a clear separation from dubious accounting adjustments that have enabled businesses such as Enron to report profits while actually approaching insolvency.

Other measures of shareholder value include:
*Added value
*Market value added
*Total shareholder return

== Market value added ==
The firm&#x27;s market value added, is the added value an investment creates for its shareholders over the total capital invested by them. MVA is the discounted sum (present value) of all future expected economic value added:

:formula_5

Note that MVA = PV of EVA.

More enlightening is that since MVA = NPV of free cash flow (FCF) it follows therefore that the

: NPV of FCF = PV of EVA;

since after all, EVA is simply the re-arrangement of the FCF formula.

== Process-based costing ==

In 2012, Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone and Minà proposed a performance and cost measurement system that integrates the EVA criteria with process-based costing (PBC). The EVA-PBC methodology allows us to implement the EVA management logic not only at the firm level but also at lower levels of the organization. EVA-PBC methodology plays an interesting role in bringing strategy back into financial performance measures.

<text>Hobart Amory Hare &quot;Hobey&quot; Baker (January 15, 1892 – December 21, 1918) was an American amateur athlete of the early twentieth century who was feted for both his sporting skill and his beauty. Considered the first American star in ice hockey by the Hockey Hall of Fame, he was also an accomplished American football player. Born into a prominent family from the Philadelphia area, he enrolled at Princeton University in 1910. Baker excelled on the university&#x27;s hockey and football teams, and became a noted amateur hockey player for the St. Nicholas Hockey Club in New York City. He was a member of three national championship teams, for football in 1911 and hockey in 1912 and 1914, and helped the St. Nicholas Club win a national amateur championship in 1915. Baker graduated from Princeton in 1914 and worked for J.P. Morgan Bank until he enlisted in the United States Army Air Service. During World War I he served with the 103rd and the 13th Aero Squadrons before being promoted to captain and named commander of the 141st Aero Squadron. Baker died in December 1918 after a plane he was test-piloting crashed, hours before he was due to leave France and return to America.

Baker was widely regarded by his contemporaries as one of the best athletes of his time and is considered one of the best early American hockey players. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, Baker was named one of the first nine inductees, the only American among them. In 1973, he became one of the initial inductees in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975, and is the only person to be in both the hockey and college football halls of fame.

F. Scott Fitzgerald idolized Baker and based Allenby, a minor character in the 1920 novel &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, on him. In 1921, Princeton named its new hockey arena the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The Hobey Baker Award was introduced in 1980, awarded annually to the best collegiate hockey player.

==Early life==

Baker was born in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, the second son of Alfred Thornton Baker, a wealthy upholsterer, and Mary Augusta Pemberton, a socialite. Alfred, known as Bobby to his friends, had played halfback while a student at Princeton University in the 1880s, the same school his father had attended. One of Baker&#x27;s ancestors was Francis Rawle, a Quaker who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1688 and became one of the wealthiest members of the city. Baker was named after his uncle, Dr. Hobart Amory Hare, who was the obstetrician at his birth and president of the Jefferson Medical Hospital in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven, Baker and his twelve-year-old brother Thornton were sent to St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. Baker&#x27;s parents divorced in 1907 and both remarried.

While at St. Paul&#x27;s, Baker was introduced to ice hockey. Malcolm Gordon, one of the first people to help develop hockey in the United States, was the coach of the school team and recognized Baker&#x27;s skill. Baker was known by his classmates to be an exceptionally fast and agile skater. He spent nights skating on frozen ponds to improve his ability to . Baker was named to the school&#x27;s varsity team at the age of fourteen and helped St. Paul&#x27;s defeat some of the best prep schools and universities in the United States. In every sport he attempted, Baker soon demonstrated proficiency. His cousin said that Baker swam through water &quot;like some sort of engine&quot;. After his first attempt at golf he was able to score in the low 40s on the school&#x27;s nine-hole course; after using roller skates for the first time, he was able to perform one-legged stunts within minutes. He once entered St. Paul&#x27;s annual cross-country race for fun and won, defeating some of the school&#x27;s most proficient runners. At the age of fifteen he was named the school&#x27;s best athlete for his skill in hockey, football, baseball, tennis, swimming, and track. Most of his former classmates recalled their time at St. Paul&#x27;s with Baker solely by his athletic achievements.

Alfred Baker lost much of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send one of his sons to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother continue his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul&#x27;s in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul&#x27;s, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school&#x27;s most popular students.

==Princeton==

In 1910, Baker enrolled at Princeton University as a member of the Class of 1914. Along with six other classmates from St. Paul&#x27;s, he lived in a house at 82 Nassau Street in Princeton. He joined the school&#x27;s hockey, football, and baseball teams in his freshman year. The university&#x27;s rules stated that students could only play two varsity sports, so Baker played outfield for the freshman baseball team before he gave up that sport to focus on hockey and football. In one of his first games with the football team, he helped defeat rival Yale when he faked a drop-kick field goal and instead ran the ball for a touchdown. Easily recognizable on the field because he wore no helmet, Baker was referred to as &quot;the blond Adonis of the gridiron&quot; by Philadelphia sportswriters. Princeton finished the 1911 season with a record of eight wins and two ties in ten games and won the national championship. During a game against Yale on November 18, 1911, Baker set a school record that still stands when he had 13 punt returns for 63 yards.

During the 1911 football season Baker scored 92 points, a school record that lasted until 1974. Princeton finished the 1912 season with seven wins, one loss, and one tie in nine games. As the Princeton hockey team did not have its own ice rink, most of their home games were played in New York City at the St. Nicholas Rink, one of the few facilities in the world with artificial ice at the time. The team finished the 1911–12 hockey season with a record of eight wins and two losses in ten games. During his sophomore year, Baker was invited to join the Ivy Club, the oldest and most prestigious of the eating clubs that were at the center of social life at the university.

Baker was named captain of the football team in 1913, his senior year. Princeton finished with a record of five wins, two losses, and one tie. Over his three-year football career with the Tigers, Baker scored 180 points, a school record that lasted until 1964 when Cosmo Iacavazzi broke it in the final quarter of his last college game. Baker caught over 900 punts in his career, and averaged 300 yards in punt returns per season. He was awarded a varsity letter in football five times; combined with the three letters he earned in hockey, his total was the most that could be earned at Princeton at the time.
It was during the 1913–14 hockey season, Baker&#x27;s senior year, that his most famous game with Princeton took place. On January 24, they played Harvard at the Boston Arena. Initially the favorite to win, Princeton had a setback as one of its star players was injured and unable to play, and another was suspended. Baker was repeatedly called offside, as he was too fast for the two replacement Princeton players (players were required to stay behind the puck-carrier at the time). In the &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime, after sixty minutes of play, Baker was not even breathing heavily. The game was the longest college hockey game played up to that point.

The final hockey game of Baker&#x27;s Princeton career was at Ottawa&#x27;s Dey&#x27;s Arena against the University of Ottawa on February 28, 1914, for the Intercollegiate Hockey Championship of America. Ottawa defeated Princeton by a 3–2 score. Princeton won the 1914 national championship after they finished with a record of ten wins and three losses. Statistics were not kept of his time at Princeton, but biographer Emil Salvini estimated Baker to have scored over 120 goals and 100 assists in three years, an average of three goals and three assists per game. As well as skill, Baker was known for his sportsmanship. In a hockey game against Harvard on January 22, 1913, Baker recorded the only penalty of his collegiate career, for slashing; Princeton lost the game 5–4 in overtime. He visited the dressing rooms of opponents after every game to shake hands with each player.

In early 1914, Baker graduated from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, and finished with above-average grades. He was named the school&#x27;s best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete and the man who had done the most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker&#x27;s three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally well with a record of twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost to Yale.

==Post-university years==

The summer after graduation, Baker toured Europe as a celebrity correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he wrote about events like the Henley Royal Regatta. Through his Princeton classmates, he was hired by Wall Street insurance firm Johnson &amp; Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne 2nd, who had also attended St. Paul&#x27;s and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne invited Baker to live with him at his house at 263 Madison Avenue, which he did for two years. Pyne was known to be homosexual, and there is evidence suggestive of a romantic relationship. In 1917, Baker wrote to Pyne: &quot;I can’t tell you what your letters mean to me...the picture of you came, also...When I feel especially dirty, I shall look at that picture...it makes me want to see you so much...I get horrible homesick and get thinking of the wonderful times we had when we weren’t scrapping.&quot;

Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, an equally rich socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.
Baker found enjoyment outside the office through sports. He joined the St. Nicholas Club, an amateur hockey team in New York, soon after he arrived in the city. Pyne introduced Baker to both polo and auto racing, sports he quickly mastered. Baker remained well known from his time at Princeton; marquees at his home arena, which was shared with Princeton, often said &quot;Hobey Baker Plays Tonight&quot;. This made Baker uncomfortable and he eventually asked the building manager to take down the sign. Preferring a life out of the public eye, he once told a reporter that he would rather have nothing written about him. In order to leave the arena quickly after hockey games without having to deal with the public, Baker often borrowed Pyne&#x27;s valet and car. During the two years that Baker played hockey with St. Nicholas, he was recognized as one of the best players in the American Amateur Hockey League and named to the post-season All-Star Teams both years. While still with the St. Nicholas Club, Baker was offered a contract by the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association. He turned down an offer of $20,000 to play three seasons as social conventions prohibited a person of his standing from playing sports for money.

On March 24, 1917, Baker played his last hockey game at the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh&#x27;s amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team defeated Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played for the love of the game.

===World War I===

Looking for new adventures, in 1916 he joined a civilian aviation corps led by New York City attorney Phillip A. Carroll on Governors Island, off the coast of Manhattan, a privately funded program to train civilians to pass the Reserve Military Aviator flying test and receive commissions in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps. He often went to the island late in the afternoon after he finished work for the day. Baker found the same enjoyment in flying that he had in sports, but with a more serious aspect. Prior to the annual Yale–Princeton football game on November 18, 1916, Baker in a Curtiss &quot;Jenny&quot; flown by fellow Governors Island student Cord Meyer (a Yalie), joined a squadron of New York National Guard Jennies led by Captain Raynal Bolling, the most to have ever flown in military formation, and flew to Palmer Stadium, home of the Princeton football team. The planes performed several maneuvers, to the delight of the crowd, and Baker landed on the field, becoming the first person to reach a football game by air.

The entry of the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally gave him a purpose in life and allowed him to make good use of his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be certified by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.

Baker was finally sent to the front in April and assigned to the 103d Aero Squadron, formed from former members of the Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps in January 1918. Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane for the first time in his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given credit for it. In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the &quot;biggest thrill I ever had in my life&quot;, and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.

During the summer, Baker was transferred to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving for the front.

Various delays in the arrival of planes and equipment meant that Baker&#x27;s squadron was unable to participate in the final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton&#x27;s black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports at the time of his death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).

Around the time of the armistice which ended the war, Baker&#x27;s engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancée and the excitement of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.

==Death==

On December 21, 1918, Baker received orders to return to the United States. Reluctant to leave France and return to his life in America, he decided to take a final flight at his squadron&#x27;s airfield in Toul. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a test flight. The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.

In heavy rain, Baker took off and began to level off at 600 feet. A quarter of a mile into the flight, the engine failed. The plane was generally easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.

A few hundred yards from the airfield, his plane crashed nose first into the ground. He was quickly freed from the aircraft by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Though newspapers reported that Baker had died as a result of engine failure, unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that his death was not accidental. Those who knew him were aware of his reluctance to return to civilian life and his feelings over the loss of Scott. He could have returned to America and played professional sport, where he could have earned far more money than from a job in finance, but his upbringing made that impossible for him. A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, and he would never again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker&#x27;s could not see a future for him in the post-war world. However, Davies refused to elaborate on what he called the &quot;suicide theory of [Baker&#x27;s] enigmatic death&quot;, as he feared that &quot;some of the old guard would be furious if they thought I was trying to prove it&quot;.

==Legacy==
Baker is considered one of the greatest ice hockey players of his era, and the first great American hockey player. He was one of the first nine players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame upon its founding in 1945, the first American so honored, and was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame as one of its charter members in 1973. Baker was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy by the National Hockey League and USA Hockey in 1987 for his contributions to hockey in the United States. In 1975, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and is the only person in both the College Football and Hockey Halls of Fame. Baker was also inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.

His popularity was such that, after he enlisted in the military, so many of his fellow Princeton athletes followed his lead that the school had to cancel its hockey team for the 1917–18 season; all five starting players enlisted in the armed forces. Of the eleven players on the team the previous season, nine enlisted shortly after Baker.

Baker was also the inspiration for literary works. In 1913 F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when Baker was a senior. Though he only spoke to Baker once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. His first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker&#x27;s middle name, and the minor character Allenby is Baker himself. Mark Goodman&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies&quot; is a fictionalized account of Baker&#x27;s life.

Baker&#x27;s honors included a citation on March 27, 1919, by General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, for exceptional bravery on May 21, 1918, when he brought down his first plane. The Hobey Baker Award was established in 1981 and is awarded annually to the best player in NCAA hockey. The Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award was also created that year and is given to the &quot;all-time great contributors to the game of college hockey&quot; each year. Since 1950, Princeton has awarded the Hobey Baker Trophy to the &quot;freshman hockey player who, among his classmates, in play, sportsmanship and influence has contributed most to the sport.&quot; When Princeton opened their hockey arena in 1921, it was named the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. At St. Paul&#x27;s, hockey players compete for an award known as &quot;Hobey&#x27;s Stick&quot;. Inside the bar of the Nassau Inn in Princeton is a photo of Baker flanked by two other famous Princeton athletes, Bill Bradley and Dick Kazmaier. The Ivy Club, of which Baker was a member, has had a painting of him in the living room. In 2024, ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; podcast explored Baker&#x27;s life, legacy, and possibly queer relationship with Percy R. Pyne II, in &quot;Searching for Hobey Baker&quot; (narrated by David Duchovny).

<doc id="216481" wikidata="Q6058269" url="?curid=216481" title="Intoxication defense">
<text>In criminal law, the intoxication defense is a defense by which a defendant may claim diminished responsibility on the basis of substance intoxication. Where a crime requires a certain mental state (&quot;mens rea&quot;) to break the law, those under the influence of an intoxicating substance may be considered to have reduced liability for their actions. With regard to punishment, intoxication may be a mitigating factor that decreases a prison or jail sentence. Numerous factors affect the applicability of the defense.

==Variation==
Societies have varied in their attitudes and cultural standards regarding public intoxication, historically based on the relationship between religion and drugs in general, and religion and alcohol in particular. In some instances, consumption of a mind-altering substance has formed the basis of religious or other socially approved ceremonies and festivals. In others, intoxication has been stigmatized as a sign of human weakness, of immorality, or as a sin. Secular approaches may also vary, having less inherent opposition to drugs but acknowledging that these may affect the inhibitions that help to keep socialized individuals from breaking prevailing social taboos which may or may not have been expressly criminalized. The attitude of a legal system to intoxicating substances can affect the applicability of intoxication as a defense under its laws: a system strongly opposed to a substance may even view intoxication as an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one.

The effect of intoxication on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in question may require proof of various levels of intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness to commit a crime, general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication may serve as a defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant&#x27;s intoxication was &quot;voluntary&quot; or &quot;involuntary&quot;: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.

==Voluntary and involuntary consumption==
A distinction may be made based on whether the defendant chose to become intoxicated, and is thus responsible for their diminished control or not. As an example, in the Dutch courage defense (see the Gallagher case in English law on intoxication), the accused hates his spouse but fears to take action. The accused therefore buys a bottle of brandy and a sharp knife. In the morning, the bottle is empty and the knife is in the spouse&#x27;s heart. Because the accused had a plan and weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness was a part of that plan, an intoxication defense is not feasible. But if, at a party, a bowl of fruit punch is &quot;spiked&quot; by someone who secretly adds gin, the resulting drunkenness is not voluntary and might be considered a possible defense. A sharper distinction is drawn in Islamic law, where involuntary intoxication may remove criminal if not financial responsibility, while voluntary intoxication has no effect and the accused is treated as if sober.

===Foreseeability test===
The presence or absence of liability may hang on a foreseeability test. The fact that the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion of drugs may cause a loss of control is well known. Thus, anyone who knowingly consumes is, at the very least, reckless as to the possibility of losing control. If they did not wish to lose control, they would not consume, so loss of control must be within the scope of their intention by continuing to consume. But, loss of control is not instantaneous and without symptoms. The issue of involuntary consumption is therefore contentious. In most legal systems, involuntary loss of control is limited to cases where there is no real loss of control with noticeable symptoms. Thus, for example, in many states, the blood alcohol level for the commission of the offence of driving under the influence is set sufficiently low that people might exceed the limit without realising that they had consumed enough alcohol to do so. Leaving aside the issue that, in some states, this is a strict liability offense excluding drunkenness as a defense, there is usually a requirement that the person who &quot;spiked&quot; the drinks be prosecuted in place of the driver. This reflects the fact that the commission of a crime has been procured by the actions of secretly adding the alcohol and the practical fact that without this rule, too many accused who are only marginally over the limit, might be encouraged to blame others for their intoxication. 

In the US, the Model Penal Code also includes the possibility of &quot;pathological intoxication&quot; whereby a medical condition that allows a small amount of alcohol to cause disproportionate intoxication that the drinker could not foresee.

More generally, the defense would be denied to people experiencing symptoms of intoxication who continued to consume the spiked drink because they ought to have known what was happening to them. Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they ought to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.

==Offenses of basic and of specific intent==
In some states, a distinction is based on the nature of the &quot;mens rea&quot; requirement. While voluntary intoxication may not be a defense to an offense of basic (sometimes termed &quot;general&quot;) intent, it is allowed as a defense to offenses requiring a &quot;specific intent&quot;. This term refers to two separate types of offense:
#A limited number of offenses require a further element of intent beyond the &quot;basic intent&quot; (where the &quot;mens rea&quot; is no more than the intentional or reckless commission of the &quot;actus reus&quot;). This additional element is termed &quot;specific intent&quot;.
#The inchoate offenses such as attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy require specific intent in a slightly different sense. The test for the existence of &quot;mens rea&quot; may be:
::(a) subjective where the court must be satisfied that the accused actually had the requisite mental element present in his or her mind at the relevant time (see concurrence);
::(b) objective where the requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; element is imputed to the accused on the basis that the reasonable person would have had the mental element in the same circumstances;
::(c) hybrid where the test is both subjective and objective.
:The rationale for the existence of criminal laws is as a deterrent to those who represent a danger to society. If an accused has actually committed the full offence, the reality of the danger has been demonstrated. For where the commission of the &quot;actus reus&quot; is in the future, a clear subjective intention to cause the &quot;actus reus&quot; of the full offense must be demonstrated. Without this &quot;specific intent&quot;, there is insufficient evidence that the accused is the clear danger as feared because, at any time before the commission of the full offense, the accused may change his or her mind and not continue.
If a &quot;specific intent&quot; in either sense is required and there is clear evidence that the accused was too intoxicated to form the element subjectively, this fact is recognised as a defense unless the loss of control was part of the plan. This, however, is of little value to defendants since there are almost always offenses of basic intent that can be charged and/or the basic intent offenses are usually lesser included offenses and an alternative verdict can be delivered by judge or jury without the need for a separate charge. In English law, note the controversial &quot;Jaggard v Dickinson&quot; [1980] 3 All ER 716 which held that, for the purposes of the statutory defense of &quot;lawful excuse&quot; under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971, a drunken belief will found the defense even though this allows drunkenness to negate basic intent. This is limited authority and does not affect the generality of the defense.

Examples of specific intent crimes include first degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation, attempts, burglary (intent to commit larceny), larceny (intent to steal), possession of or receiving stolen property (intent to steal), and robbery (intent to steal). General intent crimes include arson, rape, common law murder, and voluntary manslaughter.

<doc id="216484" wikidata="Q3566104" url="?curid=216484" title="Provocation (law)">
<text>In law, provocation is when a person is considered to have committed a criminal act partly because of a preceding set of events that might cause a reasonable individual to lose self control. This makes them less morally culpable than if the act was premeditated (pre-planned) and done out of pure malice (malice aforethought). It &quot;affects the quality of the actor&#x27;s state of mind as an indicator of moral blameworthiness.&quot;

Provocation is often a mitigating factor in sentencing. It rarely serves as a legal defense, meaning it does not stop the defendant from being guilty of the crime. It may however, lead to a lesser punishment. In some common law legal systems, provocation is a &quot;partial defense&quot; for murder charges, which can result in the offense being classified as the lesser offense of manslaughter, specifically voluntary manslaughter.

Provocation is distinct from self-defense in that self-defense is a legal defense, and refers to a justifiable action to exclusively protect oneself from imminent violence.

==Definition==
If a crime is caused by provocation, it is said to be committed in the heat of passion, under an irresistible urge incited by the provoking events, and without being entirely determined by reason. &quot;&#x27;Malice aforethought&#x27; implies a mind under the sway of reason, whereas &#x27;passion&#x27; whilst it does not imply a dethronement of reason, is the &quot;furor brevis&quot;, which renders a man deaf to the voice of reason so that, although the act was intentional to death, it was not the result of malignity of heart, but imputable to human infirmity. Passion and malice are, therefore, inconsistent motive powers, and hence an act which proceeds from the one, cannot also proceed from the other.&quot; (Hannah v. Commonwealth, Supreme Court of Virginia 1929) Establishing Provocation can reduce a murder charge to a voluntary manslaughter charge.

Provocation may be defined by statutory law, by common law, or some combination. It is a possible defense for the person provoked, or a possible criminal act by the one who caused the provocation. It may be a defense by excuse or exculpation alleging a sudden or temporary loss of control (a permanent loss of control is regarded as insanity) as a response to another&#x27;s provocative conduct sufficient to justify an acquittal, a mitigated sentence or a conviction for a lesser charge. Provocation can be a relevant factor in a court&#x27;s assessment of a defendant&#x27;s &quot;mens rea&quot;, intention, or state of mind, at the time of an act which the defendant is accused of.

In common law, provocation is established by establishing events that would be &quot;adequate&quot; to create a heat of passion in a reasonable person, and by establishing that the heat of passion was created in the accused.

==History==
The defense of provocation was first developed in English courts in the 16th and 17th centuries. During that period, a conviction of murder carried a mandatory death sentence. This inspired the need for a lesser offense. At that time, not only was it acceptable, but was socially required that a man respond with controlled violence if his honor or dignity were insulted or threatened. It was therefore considered understandable that sometimes the violence might be excessive and end with a killing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSW Brief #5/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, as social norms began changing, the idea that it was desirable for dignified men to respond with violence when they were insulted or ridiculed began losing traction and was replaced with the view that while those responses may not be ideal, that they were a normal human reaction resulting from a loss of self-control, and, as such, they deserved to be considered as a mitigating circumstance.

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the defense of provocation, and the situations in which it should apply, have led to significant controversies, with many condemning the concept as an anachronism, arguing that it contradicts contemporary social norms where people are expected to control their behavior, even when angry.

==Present day==
Today, the use of provocation as a legal defense is generally controversial, because it appears to enable defendants to receive more lenient treatment because they allowed themselves to be provoked. Judging whether an individual should be held responsible for their actions depends on an assessment of their culpability. This is usually tested by reference to a reasonable person: that is, a universal standard to determine whether an ordinary person would have been provoked and, if so, would have done as the defendant did; if the predominant view of social behavior would be that, when provoked, it would be acceptable to respond verbally and, if the provocation persists, to walk away, that will set the threshold for the defense. &quot;Furor brevis&quot; or &quot;heat of passion&quot;, is the term used in criminal law to describe the emotional state of mind following a provocation, in which acts are considered to be at least partially caused by loss of self-control, so the acts are not entirely governed by reason or expressed &quot;[It&#x27;s the heat of passion] which renders a man deaf to the voice of reason&quot;. In common law, &quot;passion usually means rage, but it also
includes fear or any violent and intense emotion sufficient to dethrone reason&quot;.

Another controversial factor of this defense, especially in UK law, is that the provoked must have carried out their act immediately after the provocation occurred, otherwise known as a &quot;sudden loss of self control&quot;, with the controversy surrounding the definition of &quot;sudden&quot;. This argument on the grounds of time still occurs and has caused many defendants, particularly women, to lose their cases on this ground, as they will often wait (in wife-battering cases) until the husband is asleep, as shown in R v Ahluwalia 1992. This led to the enactment of a new defense of &quot;loss of control&quot;. The new defense removed the &quot;sudden&quot; requirement, as it wanted to cover battered women who lose control over a long period. However, it will probably not succeed in achieving that aim. The new loss of control defense found in ss. 54-55 Coroners and Justice Act 2009 also removed sexual infidelity as a qualifying form of provocation, but in a recent controversial decision by Lord Judge in R v Clinton [2012] 1 Cr App R 26 in the Court of Appeal, Lord Judge interpreted the new offense as allowing for sexual infidelity to count under the third prong of the new defense. R v Clinton [2012] 1 Cr App R 26 has received heavy criticism from academics.

===As a partial defense for murder===
In some common law jurisdictions such as the UK, Canada, and several Australian states, the defense of provocation is only available against a charge of murder and only acts to reduce the conviction to manslaughter. This is known as &quot;voluntary manslaughter&quot;, which is considered more serious than &quot;involuntary manslaughter&quot;, and comprises both manslaughter by &quot;unlawful act&quot; and manslaughter by criminal negligence. In the United States, the Model Penal Code substitutes the broader standard of extreme emotional or mental distress for the comparatively narrower standard of provocation. Criminal law in the United States, however, falls mostly within the jurisdiction of the individual states, and not all states have adopted the Model Penal Code. Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines for federal courts, &quot;If the victim&#x27;s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence below the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense.&quot;

Provocation as a partial defence for murder came into spotlight in New Zealand during 2009 following the trial of 33-year-old university tutor Clayton Weatherston, with calls for its abolition except during sentencing. On 9 January 2008, Weatherston stabbed to death university student and girlfriend Sophie Elliott in her Dunedin home. During his trial, Weatherston used provocation as a defense to murder and claimed it was manslaughter. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a 17 years non-parole period. In response, the New Zealand Parliament introduced the Crimes (Provocation Repeal) Amendment Bill, which repealed Sections 169 and 170 of the Crimes Act 1961 and therefore abolishing the partial defense of provocation. The bill passed its third reading 116–5, with only ACT New Zealand opposing the bill, and became law effective 8 December 2009. Although the defense was removed, it could still be used for cases prior to 2009. In May 2010 Moliga Tatupu-Tinoa&#x27;i was convicted of murdering his wife at a service station in Wellington. Mr Tatupu-Tinoa&#x27;i&#x27;s lawyer Mike Antunovic unsuccessfully attempted to use the partial defense of provocation.

In 2015, Canada reformed the provocation defense restricting its use. Article 232(2) of the Criminal Code states that provocation is: &quot;Conduct of the victim that would constitute an indictable offense under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment and that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section, if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for their passion to cool.&quot; Prior to the amendment, the law required only that the provoking act be a &quot;wrongful act or insult&quot;, not a serious indictable offence.

In Australia, Tasmania became the first state to abolish the partial defence of provocation in case of murder which acted by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter. The next state to abolish it was Victoria, in 2005, however it was replaced by a new defensive homicide law. The 2005 defensive homicide laws were subsequently repealed in 2014. Western Australia abolished the partial defence of provocation in 2008. The ACT and the Northern Territory amended the law in 2004 and 2006 respectively to exclude a non-violent sexual advance as a sufficient basis for a defence of provocation in itself; such conduct must be taken into account with other conduct of the deceased to determine whether the defence has been established. By contrast in New South Wales, the law of provocation was amended in 2014 to assert that a non-violent sexual advance to the accused does not constitute extreme provocation. The new provocation law of New South Wales was amended to the defence of extreme provocation; the provocative conduct of the deceased must also have constituted a serious indictable offence, and the loss of self-control test must be measured by the objective test of the &quot;ordinary person&quot;. It was also made clear in the amendments that the conduct of the deceased may constitute extreme provocation, even if the conduct did not occur immediately before the act causing death. This was done in order to provide protection for victims of long-term abuse, or &quot;slow burn&quot; situations. In Queensland the partial defence of provocation in section 304(1) of the Criminal Code was amended in 2011, in order to &quot;reduce the scope of the defence being available to those who kill out of sexual possessiveness or
jealousy&quot;. South Australia abolished provocation in 2020.

===In cases of assault and battery===

In the United States, provocation is rarely accepted as a complete defense, but state courts have ruled that it is still a mitigating factor in matters of assault and/or battery where the sentence can be reduced or the crime lowered to a lesser charge.
In extremely rare cases, adequate provocation has resulted in the defendant never being charged with a crime. In one famous example, prosecutors in California refused to charge astronaut Buzz Aldrin with assault after he punched conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel in the face for aggressively confronting him and calling him &quot;a coward, and a liar, and a thief.&quot;

In England and Wales, provocation is similarly considered a partial defense and only reduces the penalty. Ironically, English law considers the act of intentionally provoking another person to be crime in and of itself under the charge of Fear or provocation of violence.

==Controversy==

===General concerns===
The concept of provocation is controversial, and there are many debates related to it. Critics bring several arguments against it, such as:
*people in contemporary society are expected to control their behavior, even when angry, and to not act on any impulse they may have
*provocation creates a culture of blaming the victim
*what is considered provocation is subjective
*provocation laws are very difficult to enforce since, in cases involving murder, the victim is dead and cannot present their version of facts

===Selective use of the laws===
Some people accept provocation as a valid legal concept, but express serious concerns about the context in which it is used. Data from Australia shows that the partial defense of provocation that converts murder into manslaughter has been used successfully primarily in two circumstances: sexual infidelity where a male kills his female partner or her lover; and non-violent homosexual advances.

Feminist groups and LGBT groups have been highly critical of this situation. They argue that this legitimizes or trivializes male violence against women; undermines campaigns that seek to stop violence against women; reinforces the view of women as men&#x27;s property; and maintains and justifies homophobia and discrimination against gay people.

===Objective vs subjective test===
There has been controversy on whether the objective or the subjective standard should be used when deciding on whether the behavior of the victim has constituted sufficient provocation. The objective &#x27;ordinary person&#x27; test has been criticised for ignoring characteristics such as ethnicity and culture which affect a person&#x27;s capacity to lose self-control, whereas the subjective standard that focuses on ones&#x27; personal and cultural background has been criticized for opening the door for mitigation in cases of honor killings, homophobic or racist violence and bringing in justifications for crimes that may be acceptable in the family and subculture of the accused but are rejected by wider society. A compromise can be a combination of objective and subjective analysis, as was ruled in 2020 by the Supreme Court of Ireland (replacing what was considered to be a purely subjective test that was in existence since the 1970s).

<doc id="216485" wikidata="Q466115" url="?curid=216485" title="Judah P. Benjamin">
<text>Judah Philip Benjamin (August 6, 1811 – May 6, 1884) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from Louisiana, a Cabinet officer of the Confederate States and, after his escape to Britain at the end of the American Civil War, an English barrister. Benjamin was the first Jew to hold a Cabinet position in North America and the first to be elected to the United States Senate who had not renounced his faith.

Benjamin was born to Sephardic Jewish parents from London who had moved to Saint Croix in the Danish West Indies when it was occupied by Britain during the Napoleonic Wars. Seeking greater opportunities, his family immigrated to the United States, eventually settling in Charleston, South Carolina. Benjamin attended Yale College but left without graduating. He moved to New Orleans, where he read law and passed the bar.

He rose rapidly both at the bar and in politics, becoming a wealthy slaveholding planter who was elected to and served in both houses of the Louisiana legislature prior to his election by the legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1852. There, he was a vocal advocate of slavery. After Louisiana seceded in 1861, Benjamin resigned as senator and returned to New Orleans. He soon moved to Richmond after Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him as Attorney General. Benjamin had little to do in that position, but Davis was impressed by his competence and appointed him as Secretary of War. He was a firm supporter of Davis, who reciprocated that loyalty by promoting him to Secretary of State in March 1862, while Benjamin was being criticized for the Confederate defeat at Roanoke Island.

As Secretary of State, Benjamin attempted to gain official recognition for the Confederacy by France and the United Kingdom, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. To preserve the Confederacy as military defeats made its situation increasingly desperate, he advocated freeing and arming the slaves, but his proposals were only partially accepted in the closing month of the war. When Davis fled the Confederate capital of Richmond in early 1865, Benjamin went with him. He left the presidential party and was successful in escaping from the mainland United States, but Davis was captured by the Union Army. Benjamin sailed to Britain, where he settled and became a barrister, again rising to the top of his profession before retiring in 1883. He died in Paris in the following year.

==Early and personal life==
Judah Philip Benjamin was born on August 6, 1811, in St. Croix of the Danish West Indies (today the United States Virgin Islands), a colony that was under British occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. His parents were Sephardi Jews who married in London, Philip Benjamin (who had been born on the British colony of Nevis) and the former Rebecca de Mendes. Philip and Rebecca had been shopkeepers and migrated to the West Indies in search of better opportunities.

Judah, the third of seven children, was given the same name as an older brother who died in infancy. Following a tradition adhered to by some Sephardi, he was named for his paternal grandfather, who performed the &quot;brit milah&quot;, or circumcision ceremony. The Benjamins encountered hard times in the Danish West Indies, as normal trade was blocked due to the British occupation. In 1813, the Benjamin family moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where they had relatives. Philip Benjamin was not financially successful there, and around 1821 moved with his family to Charleston, South Carolina. That city had the largest Jewish community in the United States and a reputation for religious tolerance. Benjamin was learned in his faith but not a successful businessman; Rebecca earned money for the family by operating a fruit stand near the harbor. Phillip Benjamin was a first cousin and business partner of Moroccan-Jewish trader Moses Elias Levy, the father of David Levy Yulee. Levy also immigrated to the United States, in the early 1820s.

Judah and two siblings were boarded with relatives in Fayetteville for about 18 months after the rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States. It developed practices that included shorter services conducted in English rather than in Hebrew. Benjamin was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath. The extent of Judah&#x27;s religious education is uncertain. The boy&#x27;s intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.

At the age of 14, in 1825, Benjamin entered Yale College, an institution popular among white Southerners; Vice President John C. Calhoun, a South Carolinian, was among its alumni. Although Benjamin was successful as a student at Yale, he left abruptly in 1827 without completing his course of study. The reasons for this are uncertain: In 1861, when Louisiana left the Union and Benjamin resigned as a U.S. senator, an abolitionist newspaper alleged that he had been caught as a thief at Yale. He considered bringing suit for libel but litigation was impractical. In 1901, his sole surviving classmate wrote that Benjamin had been expelled for gambling. One of his biographers, Robert Meade, considered the evidence of wrongdoing by Benjamin to be &quot;too strong to be ignored&quot;, but noted that at the time Benjamin left Yale, he was only 16 years old.

After a brief return to Charleston, Benjamin moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. According to Rabbi Bertram W. Korn&#x27;s volume on that city&#x27;s Jews, he &quot;arrived in New Orleans in 1828, with no visible assets other than the wit, charm, omnivorous mind and boundless energy with which he would find his place in the sun&quot;. After working in a mercantile business, he became a clerk for a law firm, where he began to read law, studying as an apprentice. Knowledge of French was important in practicing law in Louisiana, as the state&#x27;s code was (and is still) based on French and Spanish law. To earn money, he tutored French Creoles in English; he taught the language to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin on the condition that she teach him French. In late 1832, at age 21, he was admitted to the bar.

Early the following year, Benjamin married Natalie, who was Catholic and from a wealthy French Creole family. As part of her dowry, she brought with her $3,000 and two female slaves, aged 11 and 16 (together worth about $1,000). Even before the marriage, Natalie St. Martin had scandalized New Orleans society by her conduct. William De Ville, in his journal article on the Benjamin marriage contract, suggests that the &quot;St. Martin family was not terribly distraught to be rid of their young daughter&quot; and that &quot;Benjamin was virtually suborned to marry [Natalie], and did so without hesitation in order to further his ambitions&quot;.

The marriage was not a success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple&#x27;s only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, that Benjamin was impotent and that Natalie was unfaithful.

Benjamin&#x27;s troubled married life has led to speculation that he was gay. Daniel Brook, in a 2012 article about Benjamin, suggests that early biographies read as though &quot;historians are presenting him as an almost farcically stereotypical gay man and yet wear such impervious heteronormative blinders that they themselves know not what they write&quot;. These conjectures were not given scholarly weight until 2001, when, in an introduction to a reprinting of Meade&#x27;s biography of Benjamin, Civil War historian William C. Davis acknowledged &quot;cloaked suggestions that he [Benjamin] was a homosexual&quot;.

==Louisiana lawyer==
Within months of his admission to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice. He had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the &quot;Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana&quot; in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin&#x27;s career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy litigating cases to participate.

Benjamin became a specialist in commercial law, of which there was a great deal in New Orleans&#x27; busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.

In 1842, Benjamin had a group of cases with international implications. He represented insurance companies being sued for the value of slaves who had revolted aboard the ship &quot;Creole&quot; in 1841, as they were being transported in the coastwise slave trade from Virginia to New Orleans. The rebels had sailed the ship to Nassau in the Bahamas, a British colony, where those who came ashore were freed, as Britain had abolished slavery in 1834. The owners of the slaves brought suit for $150,000 against their insurers, who declined to pay. Benjamin made several arguments, the most prominent of which was that the slaveowners had brought the revolt on themselves by packing the slaves in overcrowded conditions. 

Benjamin said in his brief to the court:

The court ruled for Benjamin&#x27;s clients, although on other grounds. Benjamin&#x27;s brief was widely reprinted, including by abolitionist groups. Historian Eli Evans, Benjamin&#x27;s biographer, does not believe that the argument in the &quot;Creole&quot; case represented Benjamin&#x27;s personal view; rather, he was an advocate for his clients in an era when it was usual to write dramatically to distract attention from the weaker points of a case. Evans finds it remarkable and a testament to Benjamin that he could be elected to office in antebellum Louisiana, a slave society, after writing such words.

==Electoral career==

===State politician===

Benjamin was a supporter of the Whig Party from the time of its formation in the early 1830s. He became increasingly involved in the party, and in 1841 ran unsuccessfully for the New Orleans Board of Aldermen. The following year, he was nominated for the Louisiana House of Representatives. He was elected, though the Democrats alleged fraud: Whig supporters, to obtain the vote at a time when the state had a restrictive property qualification for suffrage, acquired licenses for carriages. A voter did not have to demonstrate that the carriage existed, but his license had to be accepted as evidence of ownership by election officials. The Democratic press blamed Benjamin as the strategist behind this maneuver. In 1844, the legislature voted to hold a constitutional convention, and Benjamin was chosen as a delegate from New Orleans. At the convention, Benjamin successfully opposed counting a slave as three-fifths of a human being for purposes of representation in state elections, as was done in federal elections. His position prevailed, and slaves were not counted at all for electoral purposes in Louisiana state elections. According to Evans, his &quot;tact, courtesy, and ability to find compromises impressed the political elders in all corners of the state&quot;.

Rabbi Myron Berman, in his history of Jews in Richmond, describes the attitude of antebellum white Southerners toward Jews:

By the early 1840s, Benjamin was wealthy from his law practice and, with a partner, bought a sugar cane plantation, Bellechasse. This purchase, and the subsequent construction of a grand house there, advanced Benjamin&#x27;s ambitions; the planter class controlled Louisiana politics and would trust only a man who also owned substantial land and slaves. The Benjamin marriage was by then failing, and he hoped in vain that his wife would be content at the plantation. Benjamin threw his energy into improving Bellechasse, importing new varieties of sugar cane and adopting up-to-date methods and equipment to extract and process the sugar. He purchased 140 slaves to work the plantation, and had a reputation as a humane slaveowner.

Benjamin scaled back his involvement in politics in the late 1840s, distracted by his plantation and law practice. His mother Rebecca, whom he had brought to New Orleans, died in 1847 during a yellow fever epidemic. In 1848, Benjamin was a Whig member of the Electoral College; he voted for fellow Louisiana planter, General Zachary Taylor, who was elected U.S. President. He and other Louisianans accompanied President-elect Taylor to Washington for his inauguration, and Benjamin attended a state dinner given by outgoing president James K. Polk. In 1850, Millard Fillmore, who succeeded Taylor after his death earlier that year, appointed Benjamin as judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. He was confirmed by the Senate, but he declined the appointment as the salary of $3,500 was too small. The following year, Benjamin assisted the United States Attorney in New Orleans in prosecuting American adventurers who had tried to spark a rebellion against Spanish rule in Cuba, but two trials both ended in hung juries.

===Mexican railroad===
Benjamin became interested in strengthening trade connections between New Orleans and California, and promoted an infrastructure project to build a railroad across the Mexican isthmus near Oaxaca; this would speed passenger traffic and cargo shipments. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in an 1852 speech to a railroad builders&#x27; convention, Benjamin said this trade route &quot;belongs to New Orleans. Its commerce makes empires of the countries to which it flows.&quot; Benjamin lobbied fellow lawmakers about the project, gained funds from private New York bankers, and even helped organize construction crews. In private correspondence he warned backers of problems; project workers suffered yellow fever, shipments of construction materials hit rough seas, and actions or inaction by both U.S. and Mexican officials caused delays and increases in construction costs. Backers had invested several hundred thousand dollars by the time the project died after the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.

===Election to the Senate===
Benjamin spent the summer of 1851 abroad, including a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin emerged as one of the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state&#x27;s senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs. He was the fifth person of Jewish descent to be elected to the United States Congress, after David Levy Yulee, Lewis Charles Levin, David S. Kaufman, and Emanuel B. Hart.

The outgoing president, Fillmore, offered to nominate Benjamin, a fellow Whig, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy after the Senate Democrats had defeated Fillmore&#x27;s other nominees for the post. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on February 15, 1853, that &quot;if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him.&quot; The new president, Franklin Pierce, a Democrat, also offered Benjamin a place on the Supreme Court. Pierce Butler suggested in his 1908 biography of Benjamin that the newly elected senator likely declined these offers not only because he preferred active politics, but because he could maintain his law practice and substantial income as a senator, but could not as a justice. As an advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court, Benjamin won 13 of his first 18 cases.

Judah Benjamin was sworn in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce&#x27;s inauguration. These new colleagues included Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm&#x27;s affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.

===Spokesman for slavery===
Benjamin&#x27;s view that slavery should continue was based in his belief that citizens had a right to their property as guaranteed by the Constitution. As Butler put it, &quot;he could no more see that it was right for Northern people to rob him of his slave than it would be for him to connive at horse stealing&quot;. He avoided the arguments of some that the slaves were inferior beings, and that their position was ordained by God: Evans ascribes this to Benjamin not being raised as a slaveowner, but coming to it later in life. Benjamin joined in a widespread view of white Southerners that the African American would not be ready for emancipation for many years, if ever. They feared that freeing the slaves would ruin many and lead to murders and rapes by the newly liberated of their former masters and mistresses. Such a massacre had been feared by Southerners since the Haitian Revolution, the violent revolt known as &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; in the South, in which the slaves of what became Haiti killed many whites and mulattoes in the 1804 massacre, after successfully gaining independence from French control. When the anti-slavery book &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was published in 1852, Benjamin spoke out against Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s portrayal. He said that slaves were for the most part well treated, and plantation punishments, such as whipping or branding, were more merciful than sentences of imprisonment that a white man might receive in the North for similar conduct.

In early 1854, Senator Douglas introduced his Kansas–Nebraska Bill, calling for popular sovereignty to determine whether the Kansas and Nebraska territories should enter the Union as slave or free states. Depending on the outcome of such elections, slavery might spread to territories closed to it under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. In the debate over the bill, Benjamin defended this change as returning to &quot;the traditions of the fathers&quot;, that the federal government not legislate on the subject of slavery. He said that the South merely wished to be left alone. The bill passed, but its passage had drastic political effects, as the differences between North and South that had been thought settled by both the 1820 and 1850 compromises were reopened. The Whig Party was torn apart North from South, with many Northern Whigs joining the new Republican Party, a group pledged to oppose the spread of slavery. Benjamin continued to caucus with the remains of the Whig Party through 1854 and 1855 but, as a member of a legislative minority, he had little influence on legislation and received no important committee assignments.

In May 1856, Benjamin joined the Democrats, stating they had the principles of the old-time Whig Party. He indicated, in a letter to constituents, that, as Northern Whigs had failed to vote to uphold the rights granted to Southern states in the Constitution, the Whigs, as a national party, were no more.

At a state dinner given by Pierce, Benjamin first met Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, whose wife Varina described the Louisiana senator as having &quot;rather the air of a witty bon vivant than of a great senator&quot;. The two men, both ambitious for leadership in the South and the nation, formed a relationship that Evans describes as &quot;respectful but wary&quot;. The two had occasional differences; when in 1858, Davis, by then a Mississippi senator, was irritated by Benjamin&#x27;s questioning him on a military bill and suggested that Benjamin was acting as a paid attorney, the Louisianan challenged him to a duel. Davis apologized.

Benjamin, in his speeches in the Senate, took the position that the Union was a compact by the states from which any of them could secede. Nevertheless, he understood that any dissolution would not be peaceful, stating in 1856 that &quot;dreadful will be the internecine war that must ensue&quot;. In 1859, Benjamin was elected to a second term, but allegations of involvement in land scandals and the fact that upstate legislators objected to both of Louisiana&#x27;s senators being from New Orleans stretched the contest to 42 ballots before he prevailed.

===Secession crisis===

Benjamin worked to deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling he had turned against the South. Douglas contended that although the Supreme Court, in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas&#x27;s opponent in his re-election bid, former US Representative Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas Benjamin considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention was not able to nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.

Between June and December 1860 Benjamin was almost entirely absorbed in the case of &quot;United States v. Castillero&quot;, which was tried in San Francisco during the latter part of that period. The case concerned a land grant by the former Mexican government of California. Castillero had leased part of his land to British mining companies, and when American authorities ruled the grant invalid, they hired Benjamin; he spent four months in San Francisco working on the case. The trial began in October, and Benjamin gave an address lasting six days. The local correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Benjamin, &quot;a distinguished stranger&quot;, drew the largest crowds to the courtroom and &quot;the Senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting&quot;. Once the case was submitted for decision in early November, Benjamin departed for the East. The court&#x27;s ruling, rendered in January 1861, was substantially for his clients, but not satisfied, they appealed. They lost the case entirely to an adverse decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, three justices dissenting, the following year. Benjamin was by then a Confederate Cabinet officer, and could not argue the case. His co-counsel filed his brief with the court.

By the time Benjamin returned to the east, the Republican candidate, Lincoln, had been elected president, and there was talk, in Louisiana and elsewhere, of secession from the Union. The &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot; reported that Benjamin favored secession only in the last resort. On December 23, 1860, another Louisiana periodical, the &quot;Delta&quot;, printed a letter from Benjamin dated December 8 stating that, as the people of the North were of unalterable hostility to their Southern brethren, the latter should depart from the government common to them. He also signed a joint letter from Southern Representatives to their constituents, urging the formation of a confederation of the seceding states. According to a letter reportedly written by Benjamin during the crisis, he saw secession as a means of obtaining more favorable terms in a reformed Union.

With Southern opinion turning in favor of secession, Benjamin made a farewell speech in the Senate on December 31, 1860, to a packed gallery, desirous of hearing one of the South&#x27;s most eloquent voices. They were not disappointed; Evans writes that &quot;historians consider Benjamin&#x27;s farewell ... one of the great speeches in American history.&quot; Benjamin foresaw that the South&#x27;s departure would lead to civil war:

According to Geoffrey D. Cunningham in his article on Benjamin&#x27;s role in secession, &quot;Swept up in the popular cries for independence, Benjamin willingly went out with the Southern tide.&quot; He and his Louisiana colleague, John Slidell, resigned from the Senate on February 4, 1861, nine days after their state declared secession.

==Confederate statesman==
===Attorney General===
Fearful of arrest as a rebel once he left the Senate, Benjamin quickly departed Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin&#x27;s resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis was sworn in as provisional Confederate States President on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington&#x27;s Birthday, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as attorney general; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.

Davis, in his memoirs, remarked that he chose Benjamin because he &quot;had a very high reputation as a lawyer, and my acquaintance with him in the Senate had impressed me with the lucidity of his intellect, his systematic habits, and capacity for labor&quot;. Meade suggested that Davis wanted to have a Louisianan in his Cabinet, but that a smarter course of action would have been to send Benjamin abroad to win over the European governments. Butler called Benjamin&#x27;s appointment &quot;a waste of good material&quot;. Historian William C. Davis, in his volume on the formation of the Confederate government, notes, &quot;For some there was next to nothing to do, none more so than Benjamin.&quot; The role of the attorney general in a Confederacy that did not yet have federal courts or marshals was so minimal that initial layouts for the building housing the government in Montgomery allotted no space to the Justice Department.

Meade found the time that Benjamin spent as attorney general to be fruitful, as it allowed him the opportunity to judge Davis&#x27;s character and to ingratiate himself with the president. Benjamin served as a host, entertaining dignitaries and others Davis had no time to see. At the first Cabinet meeting, Benjamin counseled Davis to have the government buy 150,000 bales of cotton for shipment to the United Kingdom, with the proceeds used to buy arms and for future needs. His advice was not taken, as the Cabinet believed the war would be short and successful. Benjamin was called upon from time to time to render legal opinions, writing on April 1 to assure Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger that lemons and oranges could enter the Confederacy duty-free, but walnuts could not.

Once Virginia joined the Confederacy, the capital was moved to Richmond, though against Benjamin&#x27;s advice—he believed that the city was too close to the North. Nevertheless, he traveled there with his brother-in-law, Jules St. Martin; the two lived in the same house throughout the war, and Benjamin probably procured the young man&#x27;s job at the War Department. Although Alabama&#x27;s Leroy Walker was Secretary of War, Davis—a war hero and former U.S. War Secretary—considered himself more qualified and gave many orders himself. When the Confederates were unable to follow up their victory at the First Battle of Manassas by threatening Washington, Walker was criticized in the press. In September, Walker resigned to join the army as a brigadier general, and Davis appointed Benjamin in his place. Butler wrote that Davis had found the cheerfully competent Benjamin &quot;a most useful member of the official family, and thought him suited for almost any post in it.&quot; In addition to his appointment as War Secretary, Benjamin continued to act as Attorney General until November 15, 1861.

===Secretary of War===
As War Secretary, Benjamin was responsible for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. It was his job, with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had chosen a &quot;defensive war&quot; strategy: the Confederacy would await invasion by the Union and then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis came to realize that his subordinate was loyal to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. Varina Davis wrote, &quot;It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason.&quot;

In his months as War Secretary, Benjamin sent thousands of communications. According to Evans, Benjamin initially &quot;turn[ed] prejudice to his favor and play[ed] on the Southerner&#x27;s instinctive respect for the Jewish mind with a brilliant performance.&quot; Nevertheless, Benjamin faced difficulties that he could do little to solve. The Confederacy lacked sufficient soldiers, trained officers to command them, naval and civilian ships, manufacturing capacity to make ships and many weapons, and powder for guns and cannon. The Union had those things and moved to block the South&#x27;s access to European supplies, both by blockades and by buying up supplies that the South might have secured. Other problems included drunkenness among the men and their officers and uncertainty as to when and where the expected Northern invasion would begin. Also, Benjamin had no experience of the military or of the executive branch of the government, placing him in a poor position to contradict Davis.

An insurgency against the Confederacy developed in staunchly pro-Union East Tennessee in late 1861, and at Davis&#x27;s order, Benjamin sent troops to crush it. Once it was put down, Benjamin and Davis were in a quandary about what to do about its leader, William &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow, who had been captured, and eventually allowed him to cross to Union-controlled territory in the hope that it would cause Lincoln to release Confederate prisoners. While Brownlow was in Southern custody, he stated that he expected, &quot;no more mercy from Benjamin than was shown by his illustrious predecessors towards Jesus Christ&quot;.

Benjamin had difficulty in managing the Confederacy&#x27;s generals. He quarreled with General P.G.T. Beauregard, a war hero since his victory at First Manassas. Beauregard sought to add a rocket battery to his command, an action that Benjamin stated was not authorized by law. He was most likely relaying Davis&#x27;s views, and when challenged by Beauregard, Davis backed Benjamin, advising the general to &quot;dismiss this small matter from your mind. In the hostile masses before you, you have a subject more worthy of your contemplation&quot;. In January 1862, Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s forces had advanced in western Virginia, leaving troops under William W. Loring at the small town of Romney. Distant from Jackson&#x27;s other forces and ill-supplied, Loring and other officers petitioned the War Department to be recalled, and Benjamin, after consulting Davis, so ordered after he used the pretext of rumored Union troop movements in the area. Jackson complied but, in a letter to Benjamin, asked to be removed from the front or to resign. High-ranking Confederates soothed Jackson into withdrawing his request.

The power of state governments was another flaw in the Confederacy and a problem for Benjamin. Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown repeatedly demanded arms and the return of Georgian troops to defend his state. North Carolina Governor Henry T. Clark also wanted troops returned to him to defend his coastline. After Cape Hatteras, on the North Carolina&#x27;s coast, was captured, Confederate forces fell back to Roanoke Island. If it fell, a number of ports in that area of the coast would be at risk, and Norfolk, Virginia, might be threatened by land.

General Henry A. Wise, commanding Roanoke, also demanded troops and supplies. He received little from Benjamin&#x27;s War Department that had no arms to send, as the Union blockade was preventing supplies from being imported. That Confederate armories were empty was a fact not publicly known at the time. Benjamin and Davis hoped that the island&#x27;s defenses could hold off the Union forces, but an overwhelming number of troops were landed in February 1862 at an undefended point, and the Confederates were quickly defeated. Combined with Union General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s capture of Fort Henry, the site of the Battle of Fort Henry, and Fort Donelson in Tennessee, it was the most severe military blow yet to the Confederacy, and there was a public outcry against Benjamin, led by General Wise.

It was revealed a quarter-century after the war that Benjamin and Davis had agreed for Benjamin to act as a scapegoat, rather than to reveal the shortage of arms. Not knowing it, the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot; accused Benjamin of &quot;stupid complacency.&quot; Diarist Mary Chestnut recorded that &quot;the mob calls him Mr. Davis&#x27;s pet Jew.&quot; The Wise family never forgave Benjamin, to the detriment of his memory in Southern eyes. Wise&#x27;s son, Captain Jennings Wise, fell at Roanoke Island, and Henry&#x27;s grandson John Wise, interviewed in 1936, told Meade that &quot;the fat Jew sitting at his desk&quot; was to blame. Another of the general&#x27;s sons, also named John Wise, wrote a highly-popular book about the South in the Civil War, &quot;The End of an Era&quot; (1899) in which he said that Benjamin &quot;had more brains and less heart than any other civic leader in the South. ... The Confederacy and its collapse were no more to Judah P. Benjamin than last year&#x27;s birds nest.&quot;

The Confederate States Congress established a special committee to investigate the military losses, and Benjamin testified before it. The Secretary of State, Virginia&#x27;s Robert M. T. Hunter, had quarreled with Davis and resigned, and in March 1862, Benjamin was appointed as his replacement. Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin&#x27;s ouster &quot;because of reverses which no one could have averted, [so] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done to the man who had now become his friend and right hand.&quot; Richmond diarist Sallie Ann Brock Putnam wrote, &quot;Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven... this act on the part of the President [in promoting Benjamin], in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of his reputation and popularity... [Benjamin] was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia.&quot; Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise&#x27;s superior, Major General Benjamin Huger, &quot;and the late secretary of war, J.P. Benjamin.&quot;

===Confederate Secretary of State===
Throughout his time as Secretary of State, Benjamin tried to induce Britain and France to recognize the Confederacy—no other nation was likely to do so unless these powerful states led the way. The protection this would bring to the Confederacy and its foreign trade was hoped to be enough to save it.

====Basis of Confederate foreign policy====
By the 1850s, cheap Southern cotton fueled the industries of Europe. The mills of Britain, developed during the first half of the 19th century, by 1860 used more cotton than the rest of the industrialized world combined. Cotton imports to Britain came almost entirely from the American South. According to an article in &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1853, &quot;let any great social or physical convulsion visit the United States, and England would feel the shock from Land&#x27;s End to John O&#x27;Groats. The lives of nearly two million of our countrymen ... hang upon a thread.&quot;

In 1855, an Ohioan, David Christy, published &quot;Cotton Is King: or Slavery in the Light of Political Economy&quot;. Christy argued that the flow of cotton was so important to the industrialized world that cutting it off would be devastating—not least to the Northern United States, as cotton was by far the largest U.S. export. This became known as the &quot;King Cotton&quot; theory, to which Davis was an enthusiastic subscriber. Benjamin also spoke in favor of the theory, though Butler suspected he may have &quot;known better&quot;, based on his firsthand knowledge of Europe.

When war came, Davis, against Benjamin&#x27;s advice, imposed an embargo on exports of cotton to nations that had not recognized the Confederate government, hoping to force such relations, especially with Britain and France. As the Union was attempting to prevent cotton from being exported from Confederate ports by a blockade and other means, this played to a certain extent into the hands of Lincoln and his Secretary of State, William H. Seward. Additionally, when the war began, Britain had a large surplus of cotton in warehouses, enough to keep the mills running at least part-time for a year or so. Although many prominent Britons believed the South would prevail, there was a reluctance to recognize Richmond until it had gained the military victories to put its foe at bay. Much of this was due to hatred of slavery, though part of it stemmed from a desire to remain on good terms with the U.S. government—due to a drought in 1862, Britain was forced to import large quantities of wheat and flour from the United States. Also, Britain feared the expansionist Americans might invade the vulnerable Canadian colonies, as Seward hinted they might.

====Appointment====
Davis appointed Benjamin as Secretary of State on March 17, 1862. He was promptly confirmed by the Confederate Senate. A motion to reconsider the confirmation was lost, 13–8. According to Butler, the appointment of Benjamin brought Davis little political support, as the average white Southerner did not understand Benjamin and somewhat disliked him. As there was not much open opposition to Davis in the South at the time, Benjamin&#x27;s appointment was not criticized, but was not given much praise either. Meade noted, &quot;the silence of many influential newspapers was ominous. [Benjamin&#x27;s] promotion in the face of such bitter criticism of his conduct in the war office caused the first serious lack of confidence in the Davis government.&quot;

Meade wrote that, since the Secretary of State would have to work closely with Jefferson Davis, Benjamin was likely the person best suited to the position. In addition to his relationship with the President, Benjamin was very close to the Confederate First Lady, Varina Davis, with whom he exchanged confidences regarding war events and the President&#x27;s health. &quot;Together, and by turns, they could help him over the most difficult days.&quot;

For recreation, Benjamin frequented Richmond&#x27;s gambling dens, playing poker and faro. He was incensed when British correspondent William Howard Russell publicized his gambling, feeling that it was an invasion of his private affairs. He was also displeased that Russell depicted him as a losing gambler, when his reputation was the opposite.

====Early days (1862–1863)====
The &quot;Trent&quot; Affair had taken place before Benjamin took office as Secretary of State: a U.S. warship had in October 1861 removed Confederate diplomats James Mason and James Slidell (Benjamin&#x27;s former Louisiana colleague in the U.S. Senate) and their private secretaries from a British-flagged vessel. The crisis brought the U.S. and Britain near war, and was resolved by their release. By the time of Benjamin&#x27;s appointment, Mason and Slidell were at their posts in London and Paris as putative ministers from the Confederacy, seeking recognition by the governments of Britain and France. With difficult communications between the South and Europe (dispatches were often lost or intercepted), Benjamin was initially reluctant to change the instructions given the agents by Secretary Hunter. Communications improved by 1863, with Benjamin ordering that dispatches be sent to Bermuda or the Bahamas, from where they reached the Confederacy by blockade runner.

As a practical matter, Benjamin&#x27;s chances of gaining European recognition rose and fell with the military fortunes of the Confederacy. When, at the end of June 1862, Confederate General Robert E. Lee turned back Union General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign in the Seven Days Battles, ending the immediate threat to Richmond, Emperor Napoleon III of France favorably received proposals from Benjamin, through Slidell, for the French to intervene on the Confederacy&#x27;s behalf in exchange for trade concessions. Nevertheless, the Emperor proved unwilling to act without Britain. In August 1862, Mason, angered by the refusal of British government ministers to meet with him, threatened to resign his post. Benjamin soothed him, stating that while Mason should not submit to insulting treatment, resignation should not take place without discussion.

The bloody standoff at Antietam in September 1862 that ended Lee&#x27;s first major incursion into the North gave Lincoln the confidence in Union arms he needed to announce the Emancipation Proclamation. British newspapers mocked Lincoln for hypocrisy in freeing slaves only in Confederate-held areas, where he could exercise no authority. British officials had been shocked by the outcome of Antietam—they had expected Lee to deliver another brilliant victory—and now considered an additional reason for intervening in the conflict. Antietam, the bloodiest day of the war, had been a stalemate; they read this as presaging an overall deadlock in the war, with North and South at each other&#x27;s throats for years as Britain&#x27;s mills sat empty and its people starved. France agreed with this assessment.

The final few months of 1862 saw a high water mark for Benjamin&#x27;s diplomacy. In October, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, expressed confidence in Confederate victory, stating in Newcastle, &quot;There is no doubt that Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South have made an army. They are making, it appears, a navy, and they have made what is more than either—they have made a nation.&quot; Later that month, Napoleon proposed to the British and Russians (a U.S. ally) that they combine to require a six months&#x27; armistice for mediation, and an end to the blockade; if they did so, it would likely lead to Southern independence. The proposal divided the British Cabinet. In mid-November, at the urgings of Palmerston and War Secretary George Cornewall Lewis, members decided to continue to wait for the South to defeat Lincoln&#x27;s forces before recognizing it. Although proponents of intervention were prepared to await another opportunity, growing realization among the British public that the Emancipation Proclamation meant that Union victory would be slavery&#x27;s end made succoring the South politically infeasible.

Benjamin had not been allowed to offer the inducement for intervention that might have succeeded—abolition of slavery in the Confederacy, and because of that, Meade deemed his diplomacy &quot;seriously, perhaps fatally handicapped&quot;. The Secretary of State blamed Napoleon for the failure, believing the Emperor had betrayed the Confederacy to get the ruler the French had installed in Mexico, Maximilian, accepted by the United States.

In Paris, Slidell had been approached by the banking firm Erlanger et Cie. The company offered to float a loan to benefit the Confederacy. The proposed terms provided a large commission to Erlanger and would entitle the bondholder to cotton at a discounted price once the South won the war. Baron Frederic Emile d&#x27;Erlanger, head of the firm, journeyed to Richmond in early 1863, and negotiated with Benjamin, although the transaction properly fell within the jurisdiction of Treasury Secretary Memminger. The banker softened the terms somewhat, though they were still lucrative for his firm. Benjamin felt the deal was worth it, as it would provide the Confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in Europe.

====Increasing desperation (1863–1865)====

The twin rebel defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in early July 1863 made it unlikely that Britain, or any other nation, would recognize a slaveholding Confederacy staggering towards oblivion. Accordingly, in August, Benjamin wrote to Mason telling him that as Davis believed the British unwilling to recognize the South, he was free to leave the country. In October, with Davis absent on a trip to Tennessee, Benjamin heard that the British consul in Savannah had forbidden British subjects in the Confederate Army from being used against the United States. The Secretary of State convened a Cabinet meeting, that expelled the remaining British consuls in Confederate-controlled territory, then notified Davis by letter. Evans suggests that Benjamin&#x27;s actions made him the Confederacy&#x27;s acting president—the first Jewish president.

Benjamin supervised the Confederate Secret Service, responsible for covert operations in the North, and financed former federal Interior Secretary Jacob Thompson to work behind the scenes financing operations that might undermine Lincoln politically. Although efforts were made to boost Peace Democrats, the most prominent actions proved to be the St. Albans Raid (an attack on a Vermont town from Canada) and an unsuccessful attempt to burn New York City. In the aftermath of the war, these activities led to accusations that Benjamin and Davis were involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, as one Confederate courier, John H. Surratt, who had received money from Benjamin, was tried for involvement in the conspiracy, though Surratt was acquitted.

As the Confederacy&#x27;s military fortunes flagged, there was increasing consideration of what would have been unthinkable in 1861—enlisting male slaves in the army and emancipating them for their service. In August 1863, B. H. Micou, a relative of a former law partner, wrote to Benjamin proposing the use of black soldiers. Benjamin responded that this was not feasible, principally for legal and financial reasons, and that the slaves were performing valuable services for the Confederacy where they were. According to Meade, &quot;Benjamin did not offer any objections to Micou&#x27;s plan except on practical grounds—he was not repelled by the radical nature of the proposal&quot;. A British financial agent for the Confederacy, James Spence, also urged emancipation as a means of gaining British recognition. Benjamin allowed Spence to remain in his position for almost a year despite the differences with Confederate policy, before finally dismissing him in late 1863. Despite official neutrality, tens of thousands from British-ruled Ireland were enlisting in the Union cause; Benjamin sent an agent to Ireland hoping to impede those efforts and Dudley Mann to Rome to urge Pope Pius IX to forbid Catholic Irish from enlisting. The Pope did not do so, though he responded sympathetically.

In January 1864, Confederate General Patrick Cleburne, of the Army of Tennessee, proposed emancipating and arming the slaves. Davis, when he heard of it, turned it down and ordered it kept secret. Evans notes that Benjamin &quot;had been thinking in similar terms for much longer, and perhaps the recommendation of so respected an officer was just the impetus he needed.&quot; The year 1864 was a disastrous one for the Confederacy, with Lee forced within siege lines at Petersburg and Union General William T. Sherman sacking Atlanta and devastating Georgia on his march to the sea. Benjamin urged Davis to send the secretary&#x27;s fellow Louisianan, Duncan Kenner, to Paris and London, with an offer of emancipation in exchange for recognition. Davis was only willing to offer gradual emancipation, and both Napoleon and Palmerston rejected the proposal. Benjamin continued to press the matter, addressing a mass meeting in Richmond in February 1865 in support of arming the slaves and emancipating them. A bill eventually emerged from the Confederate Congress in March, but it had many restrictions, and it was too late to affect the outcome of the war.

In January 1865, Lincoln, who had been re-elected the previous November, sent Francis Blair as an emissary to Richmond, hoping to secure reunion without further bloodshed. Both sides agreed to a meeting at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Benjamin drafted vague instructions for the Southern delegation, led by Vice President Alexander Stephens, but Davis insisted on modifying them to refer to North and South as &quot;two nations&quot;. This was the point that scuttled the Hampton Roads Conference; Lincoln would not consider the South a separate entity, insisting on union and emancipation.

==Escape==
By March 1865, the Confederate military situation was desperate. Most major population centers had fallen, and General Lee&#x27;s defense of Richmond was faltering against massive Union forces. Nevertheless, Benjamin retained his usual good humor; on the evening of April 1, with evacuation likely, he was at the State Department offices, singing a silly ballad of his own composition, &quot;The Exit from Shocko Hill&quot;, a graveyard district located in Richmond. On April 2, Lee sent word that he could only keep Union troops away from the line of the Richmond and Danville Railroad—the only railroad still running out of Richmond—for a short time. Those who did not leave Richmond would be trapped. At 11:00 pm that night, the Confederate President and Cabinet left aboard a Danville-bound train. Navy Secretary Stephen R. Mallory recorded that Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;hope and good humor [was] inexhaustible ... with a &#x27;never-give-up-the-ship&#x27; sort of air, referred to other great national causes which had been redeemed from far gloomier reverses than ours&quot;.

In Danville, Benjamin shared a room with another refugee, in the home of a banker. For a week, Danville served as capital of the Confederacy, until word came of Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House. With no army to shield the Confederate government, it would be captured by Union forces within days, so Davis and his Cabinet, including Benjamin, fled south to Greensboro, North Carolina. Five minutes after the train passed over the Haw River, Union cavalry raiders burned the bridge, trapping the trains that followed Davis&#x27;s.

Greensboro, fearing wrathful reprisal from the Union, gave the fugitives little hospitality, forcing Benjamin and the other Cabinet members to bunk in a railroad boxcar. Davis hoped to reach Texas, where rumor had it large Confederate forces remained active. The Cabinet met in Greensboro, and Generals Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston sketched the bleak military situation. Davis, backed as usual by Benjamin, was determined to continue to fight. The refugee government moved south on April 15. With the train tracks cut, most Cabinet members rode on horseback, but the heavyset Benjamin declared he would not ride on one until he had to, and shared an ambulance with Jules St. Martin and others. For the entertainment of his companions, Benjamin recited Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington&quot;.

In Charlotte, Benjamin stayed in the home of a Jewish merchant as surrender negotiations dragged. Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis&#x27;s plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, &quot;the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone&quot;. When he bade John Reagan goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going. &quot;To the farthest place from the United States, if it takes me to the middle of China.&quot;

With one companion, Benjamin travelled south in a poor carriage, pretending to be a Frenchman who spoke no English. He had some gold with him, and left much of it for the support of relatives. He was traveling in the same general direction as the Davis party, but evaded capture whereas Davis was taken by Union troops. Benjamin reached Monticello, Florida, on May 13 to learn Union troops were in nearby Madison. Benjamin decided to continue alone on horseback, east and south along Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast, pretending to be a South Carolina farmer. John T. Lesley, James McKay, and C. J. Munnerlyn assisted in hiding Benjamin in a swamp, before eventually transporting him to Gamble Mansion in Ellenton, on the southwest coast of Florida. From there, assisted by the blockade runner Captain Frederick Tresca, he reached Bimini in the Bahamas. His escape from Florida to England was not without hardship: at one point he pretended to be a Jewish cook on Tresca&#x27;s vessel, to deceive American soldiers who inspected it—one of whom stated it was the first time he had seen a Jew do menial labor. The small sponge-carrying vessel on which he left Bimini bound for Nassau exploded on the way, and he and the three black crewmen eventually managed to return to Bimini. Tresca&#x27;s ship was still there, and he chartered it to take him to Nassau. From there, he took a ship for Havana, and on August 6, 1865, left there for Britain. He was not yet done with disaster; his ship caught fire after departing St. Thomas, and the crew put out the flames only with difficulty. On August 30, 1865, Judah Benjamin arrived at Southampton, in Britain.

==Career in England==

Benjamin spent a week in London assisting Mason in winding up Confederate affairs. He then went to Paris to visit his wife and daughter for the first time since before the war. Friends in Paris urged him to join a mercantile firm there, but Benjamin felt that such a career would be subject to interference by Seward and the United States. Accordingly, Benjamin sought to shape his old course in a new country, resuming his legal career as an English barrister. Most of Benjamin&#x27;s property had been destroyed or confiscated, and he needed to make a living for himself and his relatives. He had money in the United Kingdom as he had, during the war, purchased cotton for transport to Liverpool by blockade runner.

On January 13, 1866, Benjamin enrolled at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and soon thereafter was admitted to read law under Charles Pollock, son of Chief Baron Charles Edward Pollock, who took him as a pupil at his father&#x27;s direction. Benjamin, despite his age of 54, was initially required, like his thirty-years-younger peers, to attend for twelve terms, that is, three years. According to Benjamin&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, though, &quot;the secretary of the Confederacy was dispensed from the regular three years of unprofitable dining, and called to the bar&quot; on June 6, 1866.

Once qualified as a barrister, Benjamin chose to join the Northern Circuit, as it included Liverpool, where his connections in New Orleans and knowledge of mercantile affairs would do him the most good. In an early case, he defended two former Confederate agents against a suit by the United States to gain assets said to belong to that nation. Although he lost that case (&quot;United States v Wagner&quot;) on appeal, he was successful against his former enemies in &quot;United States v McRae&quot; (1867). He had need of rapid success, as most of his remaining assets were lost in the collapse of the firm of Overend, Gurney and Company. He was reduced to penning columns on international affairs for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

According to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, &quot;repeating his Louisiana progress, Benjamin made his reputation among his new peers by publication&quot;. In an early representation, he wrote a complex governing document for an insurance firm that other counsel had declined despite the substantial fee, due to the early deadline. After brief study, Benjamin wrote out the document, never making a correction or erasure. In 1868, Benjamin published &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Sale of Personal Property, With Reference to the American Decisions, to the French Code, and Civil Law&quot;. This work, known for short as &quot;Benjamin on Sales&quot;, became a classic in both Britain and America, and launched his career as a barrister. It went through three editions prior to Benjamin&#x27;s death in 1884; an eighth edition was published in 2010. Today &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s Sale of Goods&quot; forms part of the &quot;common law library&quot; of key practitioner texts on English civil law.

In 1867, Benjamin had been indicted in Richmond, along with Davis, Lee, and others, for waging war against the United States. The indictment was soon quashed. Davis visited London in 1868, free on bail, and Benjamin advised him not to take legal action against the author of a book that had angered Davis, as it would only give the book publicity. Benjamin corresponded with Davis, and met with him on the former rebel president&#x27;s visits to Europe during Benjamin&#x27;s lifetime, though the two were never as close as they had been during the war.

Benjamin was created a &quot;Palatine silk&quot;, entitled to the precedence of a Queen&#x27;s Counsel within Lancashire, in July 1869. There was a large creation of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in early 1872, but Benjamin was not included; it was stated in his &quot;Times&quot; obituary that he had put his name forward. Later that year, he argued the case of &quot;Potter v Rankin&quot; before the House of Lords and so impressed Lord Hatherley that a patent of precedence was soon made out, giving Benjamin the privileges of a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. As he became prominent as a barrister, he discontinued practice before juries (at which he was less successful) in favor of trials or appeals before judges. In his last years in practice, he demanded an additional fee of 100 guineas (£105) to appear in any court besides the House of Lords and the Privy Council. In 1875, he was made a bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

In 1881, Benjamin represented Arthur Orton, the Tichborne claimant, before the House of Lords. Orton, a butcher from Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, had claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne, a baronet who had vanished some years previously, and Orton had perjured himself in the course of defending his claim. Benjamin sought to overturn the sentence of 14 years passed on Orton, but was not successful.

=== Decline and death ===

In his final years, Benjamin suffered from health issues. In 1880, he was badly injured in a fall from a tram in Paris. He also developed diabetes. He suffered a heart attack in Paris at the end of 1882, and his doctor ordered him to retire. His health improved enough to allow him to travel to London in June 1883 for a dinner in his honor attended by the English bench and bar. He returned to Paris and suffered a relapse of his heart trouble in early 1884. Natalie Benjamin had the last rites of the Catholic Church administered to her Jewish husband before his death in Paris on May 6, 1884, and funeral services were held in a church prior to Judah Benjamin&#x27;s interment at Père Lachaise Cemetery in the St. Martin family crypt. His grave did not bear his name until 1938, when a plaque was placed by the Paris chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

==Appraisal==

Benjamin was the first U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. In 1845, David Yulee, born David Levy, his second cousin, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and eventually formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin married a non-Jew, was not a member of a synagogue, and took no part in communal affairs. He rarely spoke of his Jewish background publicly, but was not ashamed of it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on this subject come from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who referred to an address Benjamin delivered in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city&#x27;s Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains &quot;part of the Benjamin legend&quot;, according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an &quot;Israelite in Egyptian clothing&quot;. Benjamin is supposed to have replied, &quot;It is true that I am a Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain.&quot; However, this anecdote is likely apocryphal as the same exchange between British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and Daniel O&#x27;Connell took place in the House of Commons in 1835.

Edgar M. Kahn, in his journal article on the 1860 California sojourn, wrote, &quot;Benjamin&#x27;s life is an example of a man&#x27;s determination to overcome almost insurmountable barriers by industry, perseverance, and intelligent use of a remarkable brain.&quot; This brilliance was recognized by contemporaries; Salomon de Rothschild, in 1861, deemed Benjamin &quot;the greatest mind&quot; in North America. Nevertheless, according to Meade, &quot;he was given to quixotic enthusiasms and was sometimes too cocksure of his knowledge.&quot; Ginsburg said of Benjamin, &quot;he rose to the top of the legal profession twice in one lifetime, on two continents, beginning his first ascent as a raw youth and his second as a fugitive minister of a vanquished power.&quot; Davis, after Benjamin&#x27;s death, deemed him the most able member of his Cabinet, and said that the lawyer&#x27;s postwar career had fully vindicated his confidence in him.
According to Brook, &quot;in every age, a heroic sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurity—and invariably fails.&quot; Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which &quot;the task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious&quot;. After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, in contrast to Davis and other Confederate leaders. Part of this was due to Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history, it would not have been characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin&#x27;s success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln&#x27;s assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin&#x27;s postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. &quot;For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin became a kind of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry.&quot;

Those writing on Jewish history were reluctant to glorify a slaveowner, and reacted to Benjamin&#x27;s story with &quot;embarrassed dismay&quot;. This was especially so in the two generations following 1865 when the question of the Civil War remained an active issue in American politics. It was not until the 1930s that Benjamin began to be mentioned as a significant figure in the history of the United States, and in the chronicle of the Jews there. Nevertheless, Tom Mountain, in his 2009 article on Benjamin, points out that Benjamin was respected in the South as a leader of the rebel cause for a century after the Civil War, and that Southern schoolchildren who could not name the current Secretary of State in Washington knew about Benjamin. Reform Rabbi Daniel Polish noted in 1988 that Benjamin &quot;represent[ed] a significant dilemma [in] my years growing up as a Jew both proud of his people and with an intense commitment to the ideals of liberalism and human solidarity that I found embodied in the civil rights movement.&quot;

Benjamin appears as a character in a number of works of fiction, notably Viña Delmar&#x27;s 1956 historical novel &quot;Beloved&quot; and Dara Horn&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;All Other Nights&quot;. The subject of Benjamin&#x27;s fictional afterlife has been discussed by Michael Hoberman, who notes how the man&#x27;s &quot;many mysteries&quot; have appealed to novelists as well as historians.

Berman recounts a story that during the Civil War, Benjamin was called to the Torah at Beth Ahabah synagogue in Richmond. However, there is no proof of this, nor does Benjamin&#x27;s name appear in any surviving record of the Jews of that city. &quot;But whether or not Benjamin practiced Judaism overtly or contributed to Jewish causes, to the Jews of the South, he was a symbol of a coreligionist who was a man among men&quot;. According to Evans, &quot;Benjamin survives, as he willed it: a shadowy figure in Civil War history&quot;. Kahn noted that Benjamin &quot;is epitomized as a foremost orator, lawyer, and statesman, without a peer at the bars of two of the world&#x27;s greatest nations&quot;. Meade questioned whether Benjamin&#x27;s character can ever be fully understood:

A monument was installed in 1948 in Charlotte, North Carolina commemorating Benjamin. It was removed in 2020 amid the George Floyd protests.

<text>The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects. They are named after Eugène Catalan, though they were previously discovered in the 1730s by Minggatu.

The -th Catalan number can be expressed directly in terms of the central binomial coefficients by

:formula_1

The first Catalan numbers for are

== Properties ==
An alternative expression for is
:formula_2 for formula_3
which is equivalent to the expression given above because formula_4. This expression shows that is an integer, which is not immediately obvious from the first formula given. This expression forms the basis for a proof of the correctness of the formula.

Another alternative expression is
:formula_5
which can be directly interpreted in terms of the cycle lemma; see below.

The Catalan numbers satisfy the recurrence relations
:formula_6
and
:formula_7

Asymptotically, the Catalan numbers grow as
formula_8
in the sense that the quotient of the -th Catalan number and the expression on the right tends towards 1 as approaches infinity.

This can be proved by using the asymptotic growth of the central binomial coefficients, by Stirling&#x27;s approximation for formula_9, or via generating functions.

The only Catalan numbers that are odd are those for which ; all others are even. The only prime Catalan numbers are and . More generally, the multiplicity with which a prime divides can be determined by first expressing in base . For , the multiplicity is the number of 1 bits, minus 1. For an odd prime, count all digits greater than ; also count digits equal to unless final; and count digits equal to if not final and the next digit is counted. The only known odd Catalan numbers that do not have last digit 5 are , , , , and . The odd Catalan numbers, for , do not have last digit 5 if has a base 5 representation containing 0, 1 and 2 only, except in the least significant place, which could also be a 3.

The Catalan numbers have the integral representations

:formula_10
which immediately yields formula_11.

This has a simple probabilistic interpretation. Consider a random walk on the integer line, starting at 0. Let -1 be a &quot;trap&quot; state, such that if the walker arrives at -1, it will remain there. The walker can arrive at the trap state at times 1, 3, 5, 7..., and the number of ways the walker can arrive at the trap state at time formula_12 is formula_13. Since the 1D random walk is recurrent, the probability that the walker eventually arrives at -1 is formula_14.

== Applications in combinatorics ==

There are many counting problems in combinatorics whose solution is given by the Catalan numbers. The book &quot;Enumerative Combinatorics: Volume 2&quot; by combinatorialist Richard P. Stanley contains a set of exercises which describe 66 different interpretations of the Catalan numbers. Following are some examples, with illustrations of the cases and .
* is the number of Dyck words of length . A Dyck word is a string consisting of X&#x27;s and Y&#x27;s such that no initial segment of the string has more Y&#x27;s than X&#x27;s. For example, the following are the Dyck words up to length 6:
 XY
 XXYY     XYXY
 XXXYYY     XYXXYY     XYXYXY     XXYYXY     XXYXYY
* Re-interpreting the symbol X as an open parenthesis and Y as a close parenthesis, counts the number of expressions containing pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched:
* is the number of different ways factors can be completely parenthesized (or the number of ways of associating applications of a binary operator, as in the matrix chain multiplication problem). For , for example, we have the following five different parenthesizations of four factors:
((ab)c)d     (a(bc))d     (ab)(cd)     a((bc)d)     a(b(cd))
* Successive applications of a binary operator can be represented in terms of a full binary tree, by labeling each leaf . It follows that is the number of full binary trees with leaves, or, equivalently, with a total of internal nodes:
* is the number of non-isomorphic ordered (or plane) trees with vertices. See encoding general trees as binary trees. For example, is the number of possible parse trees for a sentence (assuming binary branching), in natural language processing.
* is the number of monotonic lattice paths along the edges of a grid with square cells, which do not pass above the diagonal. A monotonic path is one which starts in the lower left corner, finishes in the upper right corner, and consists entirely of edges pointing rightwards or upwards. Counting such paths is equivalent to counting Dyck words: X stands for &quot;move right&quot; and Y stands for &quot;move up&quot;.

The following diagrams show the case :

This can be represented by listing the Catalan elements by column height:

 [0,0,0,0] [0,0,0,1] [0,0,0,2] [0,0,1,1]

 [0,1,1,1] [0,0,1,2] [0,0,0,3] [0,1,1,2] [0,0,2,2] [0,0,1,3]

 [0,0,2,3] [0,1,1,3] [0,1,2,2] [0,1,2,3]

* A convex polygon with sides can be cut into triangles by connecting vertices with non-crossing line segments (a form of polygon triangulation). The number of triangles formed is and the number of different ways that this can be achieved is . The following hexagons illustrate the case :

* is the number of stack-sortable permutations of . A permutation is called stack-sortable if , where is defined recursively as follows: write where is the largest element in and and are shorter sequences, and set , with being the identity for one-element sequences.
* is the number of permutations of that avoid the permutation pattern 123 (or, alternatively, any of the other patterns of length 3); that is, the number of permutations with no three-term increasing subsequence. For , these permutations are 132, 213, 231, 312 and 321. For , they are 1432, 2143, 2413, 2431, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421, 4132, 4213, 4231, 4312 and 4321.
* is the number of noncrossing partitions of the set . &quot;A fortiori&quot;, never exceeds the -th Bell number. is also the number of noncrossing partitions of the set in which every block is of size 2.
* is the number of ways to tile a stairstep shape of height with rectangles. Cutting across the anti-diagonal and looking at only the edges gives full binary trees. The following figure illustrates the case :

* is the number of ways to form a &quot;mountain range&quot; with upstrokes and downstrokes that all stay above a horizontal line. The mountain range interpretation is that the mountains will never go below the horizon.

* is the number of standard Young tableaux whose diagram is a 2-by- rectangle. In other words, it is the number of ways the numbers can be arranged in a 2-by- rectangle so that each row and each column is increasing. As such, the formula can be derived as a special case of the hook-length formula.

* formula_15 is the number of length sequences that start with formula_16, and can increase by either formula_17 or formula_16, or decrease by any number (to at least formula_16). For formula_20 these are formula_21. From a Dyck path, start a counter at . An X increases the counter by and a Y decreases it by . Record the values at only the X&#x27;s. Compared to the similar representation of the Bell numbers, only formula_22 is missing.

== Proof of the formula ==

There are several ways of explaining why the formula
:formula_23
solves the combinatorial problems listed above. The first proof below uses a generating function. The other proofs are examples of bijective proofs; they involve literally counting a collection of some kind of object to arrive at the correct formula.

=== First proof ===

We first observe that all of the combinatorial problems listed above satisfy Segner&#x27;s recurrence relation

:formula_24

For example, every Dyck word of length ≥ 2 can be written in a unique way in the form
with (possibly empty) Dyck words and .

The generating function for the Catalan numbers is defined by

:formula_25

The recurrence relation given above can then be summarized in generating function form by the relation

:formula_26

in other words, this equation follows from the recurrence relation by expanding both sides into power series. On the one hand, the recurrence relation uniquely determines the Catalan numbers; on the other hand, interpreting as a quadratic equation of and using the quadratic formula, the generating function relation can be algebraically solved to yield two solution possibilities

:formula_27  or  formula_28.

From the two possibilities, the second must be chosen because only the second gives

:formula_29.

The square root term can be expanded as a power series using the binomial series

formula_30
Thus,
formula_31

=== Second proof ===


We count the number of paths which start and end on the diagonal of an grid. All such paths have right and up steps. Since we can choose which of the steps are up or right, there are in total formula_32 monotonic paths of this type. A &quot;bad&quot; path crosses the main diagonal and touches the next higher diagonal (red in the illustration).

The part of the path after the higher diagonal is then flipped about that diagonal, as illustrated with the red dotted line. This swaps all the right steps to up steps and vice versa. In the section of the path that is not reflected, there is one more up step than right steps, so therefore the remaining section of the bad path has one more right step than up steps. When this portion of the path is reflected, it will have one more up step than right steps.

Since there are still steps, there are now up steps and right steps. So, instead of reaching , all bad paths after reflection end at . Because every monotonic path in the grid meets the higher diagonal, and because the reflection process is reversible, the reflection is therefore a bijection between bad paths in the original grid and monotonic paths in the new grid.

The number of bad paths is therefore:

:formula_33

and the number of Catalan paths (i.e. good paths) is obtained by removing the number of bad paths from the total number of monotonic paths of the original grid,

:formula_34

In terms of Dyck words, we start with a (non-Dyck) sequence of X&#x27;s and Y&#x27;s and interchange all X&#x27;s and Y&#x27;s after the first Y that violates the Dyck condition. After this Y, note that there is exactly one more Y than there are Xs.

=== Third proof ===

This bijective proof provides a natural explanation for the term appearing in the denominator of the formula for . A generalized version of this proof can be found in a paper of Rukavicka Josef (2011).
Given a monotonic path, the exceedance of the path is defined to be the number of vertical edges above the diagonal. For example, in Figure 2, the edges above the diagonal are marked in red, so the exceedance of this path is 5.

Given a monotonic path whose exceedance is not zero, we apply the following algorithm to construct a new path whose exceedance is less than the one we started with.
* Starting from the bottom left, follow the path until it first travels above the diagonal.
* Continue to follow the path until it &quot;touches&quot; the diagonal again. Denote by the first such edge that is reached.
* Swap the portion of the path occurring before with the portion occurring after .
In Figure 3, the black dot indicates the point where the path first crosses the diagonal. The black edge is , and we place the last lattice point of the red portion in the top-right corner, and the first lattice point of the green portion in the bottom-left corner, and place X accordingly, to make a new path, shown in the second diagram.
The exceedance has dropped from to . In fact, the algorithm causes the exceedance to decrease by for any path that we feed it, because the first vertical step starting on the diagonal (at the point marked with a black dot) is the only vertical edge that changes from being above the diagonal to being below it when we apply the algorithm - all the other vertical edges stay on the same side of the diagonal.

It can be seen that this process is &quot;reversible&quot;: given any path whose exceedance is less than , there is exactly one path which yields when the algorithm is applied to it. Indeed, the (black) edge , which originally was the first horizontal step ending on the diagonal, has become the &quot;last&quot; horizontal step &quot;starting&quot; on the diagonal. Alternatively, reverse the original algorithm to look for the first edge that passes &quot;below&quot; the diagonal.

This implies that the number of paths of exceedance is equal to the number of paths of exceedance , which is equal to the number of paths of exceedance , and so on, down to zero. In other words, we have split up the set of &quot;all&quot; monotonic paths into equally sized classes, corresponding to the possible exceedances between 0 and . Since there are formula_35 monotonic paths, we obtain the desired formula formula_36

Figure 4 illustrates the situation for . Each of the 20 possible monotonic paths appears somewhere in the table. The first column shows all paths of exceedance three, which lie entirely above the diagonal. The columns to the right show the result of successive applications of the algorithm, with the exceedance decreasing one unit at a time. There are five rows, that is , and the last column displays all paths no higher than the diagonal.

Using Dyck words, start with a sequence from formula_37. Let formula_38 be the first that brings an initial subsequence to equality, and configure the sequence as formula_39. The new sequence is formula_40.

=== Fourth proof ===

This proof uses the triangulation definition of Catalan numbers to establish a relation between and .

Given a polygon with sides and a triangulation, mark one of its sides as the base, and also orient one of its total edges. There are such marked triangulations for a given base.

Given a polygon with sides and a (different) triangulation, again mark one of its sides as the base. Mark one of the sides other than the base side (and not an inner triangle edge). There are such marked triangulations for a given base.

There is a simple bijection between these two marked triangulations: We can either collapse the triangle in whose side is marked (in two ways, and subtract the two that cannot collapse the base), or, in reverse, expand the oriented edge in to a triangle and mark its new side.

Thus
:formula_41.

Write formula_42

Because

:formula_43

we have

:formula_44

Applying the recursion with formula_45 gives the result.

=== Fifth proof ===

This proof is based on the Dyck words interpretation of the Catalan numbers, so formula_15 is the number of ways to correctly match pairs of brackets. We denote a (possibly empty) correct string with and its inverse with . Since any can be uniquely decomposed into formula_47, summing over the possible lengths of formula_48 immediately gives the recursive definition
:formula_49.

Let be a balanced string of length , i.e. contains an equal number of formula_50 and formula_51, so formula_52. A balanced string can also be uniquely decomposed into either formula_53 or formula_54, so

:formula_55

Any incorrect (non-Catalan) balanced string starts with formula_56, and the remaining string has one more formula_50 than formula_51, so
:formula_59

Also, from the definitions, we have:

:formula_60

Therefore, as this is true for all ,

:formula_61

:formula_62

:formula_63

:formula_64

=== Sixth proof ===

This proof is based on the Dyck words interpretation of the Catalan numbers and uses the cycle lemma of Dvoretzky and Motzkin.

We call a sequence of X&#x27;s and Y&#x27;s &quot;dominating&quot; if, reading from left to right, the number of X&#x27;s is always strictly greater than the number of Y&#x27;s. The cycle lemma states that any sequence of formula_65 X&#x27;s and formula_66 Y&#x27;s, where formula_67, has precisely formula_68 dominating circular shifts. To see this, arrange the given sequence of formula_69 X&#x27;s and Y&#x27;s in a circle. Repeatedly removing XY pairs leaves exactly formula_68 X&#x27;s. Each of these X&#x27;s was the start of a dominating circular shift before anything was removed. For example, consider formula_71. This sequence is dominating, but none of its circular shifts formula_72, formula_73, formula_74 and formula_75 are.

A string is a Dyck word of formula_66 X&#x27;s and formula_66 Y&#x27;s if and only if prepending an X to the Dyck word gives a dominating sequence with formula_78 X&#x27;s and formula_66 Y&#x27;s, so we can count the former by instead counting the latter. In particular, when formula_80, there is exactly one dominating circular shift. There are formula_81 sequences with exactly formula_78 X&#x27;s and formula_66 Y&#x27;s. For each of these, only one of the formula_84 circular shifts is dominating. Therefore there are formula_85 distinct sequences of formula_78 X&#x27;s and formula_66 Y&#x27;s that are dominating, each of which corresponds to exactly one Dyck word.

== Hankel matrix ==

The Hankel matrix whose entry is the Catalan number has determinant 1, regardless of the value of . For example, for we have
:formula_88

Moreover, if the indexing is &quot;shifted&quot; so that the entry is filled with the Catalan number then the determinant is still 1, regardless of the value of .
For example, for we have
:formula_89

Taken together, these two conditions uniquely define the Catalan numbers.

Another feature unique to the Catalan–Hankel matrix is that the submatrix starting at has determinant .

:formula_90

:formula_91

:formula_92

:formula_93

et cetera.

== History ==

The Catalan sequence was described in 1751 by Leonhard Euler, who was interested in the number of different ways of dividing a polygon into triangles. The sequence is named after Eugène Charles Catalan, who discovered the connection to parenthesized expressions during his exploration of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The reflection counting trick (second proof) for Dyck words was found by Désiré André in 1887.

The name “Catalan numbers” originated from John Riordan.

In 1988, it came to light that the Catalan number sequence had been used in China by the Mongolian mathematician Mingantu by 1730. That is when he started to write his book &quot;Ge Yuan Mi Lu Jie Fa&quot; &quot;[The Quick Method for Obtaining the Precise Ratio of Division of a Circle]&quot;, which was completed by his student Chen Jixin in 1774 but published sixty years later. Peter J. Larcombe (1999) sketched some of the features of the work of Mingantu, including the stimulus of Pierre Jartoux, who brought three infinite series to China early in the 1700s.

For instance, Ming used the Catalan sequence to express series expansions of formula_94 and formula_95 in terms of formula_96.

== Generalizations ==
The Catalan numbers can be interpreted as a special case of the Bertrand&#x27;s ballot theorem. Specifically, formula_15 is the number of ways for a candidate A with votes to lead candidate B with votes.

The two-parameter sequence of non-negative integers formula_98
is a generalization of the Catalan numbers. These are named super-Catalan numbers, per Ira Gessel. These should not confused with the Schröder–Hipparchus numbers, which sometimes are also called super-Catalan numbers.

For formula_99, this is just two times the ordinary Catalan numbers, and for formula_100, the numbers have an easy combinatorial description.
However, other combinatorial descriptions are only known
for formula_101 and formula_102,
and it is an open problem to find a general combinatorial interpretation.

Sergey Fomin and Nathan Reading have given a generalized Catalan number associated to any finite crystallographic Coxeter group, namely the number of fully commutative elements of the group; in terms of the associated root system, it is the number of anti-chains (or order ideals) in the poset of positive roots. The classical Catalan number formula_15 corresponds to the root system of type formula_104. The classical recurrence relation generalizes: the Catalan number of a Coxeter diagram is equal to the sum of the Catalan numbers of all its maximal proper sub-diagrams.

The Catalan numbers are a solution of a version of the Hausdorff moment problem.

<doc id="216489" wikidata="Q2835713" url="?curid=216489" title="Kirkpatrick Doctrine">
<text>The Kirkpatrick Doctrine was a foreign policy doctrine expounded by United States ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick in the early 1980s based on her 1979 essay, &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;. The doctrine was used to justify U.S. foreign policy of supporting Third World anti-communist dictatorships during the Cold War.

==Doctrine==
Kirkpatrick claimed that states in the Soviet bloc and other communist states were totalitarian regimes, while pro-Western dictatorships were merely &quot;authoritarian&quot; ones. According to Kirkpatrick, totalitarian regimes were more stable and self-perpetuating than authoritarian regimes, and thus had a greater propensity to influence neighboring states.

The Kirkpatrick Doctrine was particularly influential during the administration of President Ronald Reagan. The Reagan administration gave varying degrees of support to several militaristic anti-communist dictatorships, including those in Guatemala (to 1985), the Philippines (to 1986), and Argentina (to 1983), and armed the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; in the Soviet–Afghan War, UNITA during the Angolan Civil War, and the Contras during the Nicaraguan Revolution as a means of toppling governments, or crushing revolutionary movements, in those countries that did not support the aims of the U.S.

According to Kirkpatrick, authoritarian regimes merely try to control and/or punish their subjects&#x27; behaviors, while totalitarian regimes move beyond that into attempting to control the thoughts of their subjects, using not only propaganda, but brainwashing, re-education, widespread domestic espionage, and mass political repression based on state ideology. Totalitarian regimes also often attempt to undermine or destroy community institutions deemed ideologically tainted (e.g., religious ones, or even the nuclear family), while authoritarian regimes by and large leave these alone. For this reason, she argued that the process of restoring democracy is easier in formerly authoritarian than in formerly totalitarian states, and that authoritarian states are more amenable to gradual reform in a democratic direction than are totalitarian states.

==Criticism==
Kirkpatrick&#x27;s tenet that totalitarian regimes are more stable than authoritarian regimes has come under criticism since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, particularly as Kirkpatrick predicted that the Soviet system would persist for decades.

Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute has also disputed the doctrine, noting that while communist movements tend to depose rival authoritarians, the traditional authoritarian regimes supported by the U.S. came to power by overthrowing democracies. He thus concludes that while communist regimes are more difficult to eradicate, traditional autocratic regimes &quot;pose the more lethal threat to functioning democracies.&quot;

<doc id="216492" wikidata="Q2599077" url="?curid=216492" title="Yale College">
<text>Yale College is the undergraduate college of Yale University. Founded in 1701, it is the original school of the university. Although other Yale schools were founded as early as 1810, all of Yale was officially known as Yale College until 1887, when its schools were confederated and the institution was renamed Yale University. 

Originally established to train Congregationalist ministers, the college began teaching humanities and natural sciences by the late 18th century. At the same time, students began organizing extracurricular organizations: first literary societies, and later publications, sports teams, and singing groups. By the middle of the 19th century, it was the largest college in the United States. In 1847, it was joined by another undergraduate school at Yale, the Sheffield Scientific School, which was absorbed into the college in 1956. These merged curricula became the basis of the modern-day liberal arts curriculum, which requires students to take courses in a broad range of subjects, including foreign language, composition, sciences, and quantitative reasoning, in addition to electing a departmental major in their sophomore year.

The most distinctive feature of undergraduate life is the school&#x27;s system of residential colleges, established in 1932, and modeled after the constituent colleges of English universities. Undergraduates live in these colleges after their freshman year, when most live on the school&#x27;s Old Campus.

==History==


The Collegiate School was founded in 1701 by a charter drawn by ten Congregationalist ministers led by James Pierpont and approved by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut. Originally situated in Abraham Pierson&#x27;s home in Killingworth, Connecticut, the college moved to Old Saybrook, Connecticut in 1703, when Nathaniel Lynde, the first treasurer of Yale, donated land and a building. The college moved again to New Haven in 1718, and was renamed for Elihu Yale, an early benefactor, merchant, and philanthropist. Founded as a school to train ministers, original curriculum included only coursework in theology and sacred languages. Although early faculty, including Jonathan Edwards and Elisha Williams, maintained strict Congregational orthodoxy, by the time of the American Revolution subsequent rectors, especially Ezra Stiles, relaxed the curriculum to include humanities and limited natural science education.

Scientific courses introduced by chemist Benjamin Silliman in 1801, made the college an early hub of scientific education, a curriculum which was grafted into Yale&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School in 1847. As in many of Yale&#x27;s sister institutions, debates about the expansiveness of the undergraduate curriculum were waged throughout the early 19th century, with statements like the Yale Report of 1828 re-asserting Yale&#x27;s conservative theological heritage and faculty. Later in the century, William Graham Sumner, the first professor of sociology in the United States, introduced studies in the social sciences. These expanding fields of study were integrated with graduate schools of the university and amalgamated into a course of liberal arts education, which presaged the advent of divisional majors in the twentieth century.

The relaxation of curriculum came with expansion of the extracurriculum. Student literary societies emerged as early as 1750, singing groups and student publications in the early 1800s, fraternities and secret societies in the mid-nineteenth century, and intercollegiate athletics by the century&#x27;s end. Participation and leadership in these groups was an important social signifier and a route to induction into prestigious senior societies. Thus extracurricular participation became central to student life and social advancement, an ethos that became a template for collegiate life across the United States.
By 1870, Yale was the largest undergraduate institution in the country. The growth of the student body prompted major growth in the college&#x27;s physical campus, the greatest expansion of which occurred in 1933, when a gift of Edward S. Harkness created and endowed eight residential colleges. Modeled after the college system of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, the colleges were intended to be the social and residential centers of undergraduate life while leaving academic programs under the oversight of university&#x27;s departments. Two additional colleges were built by 1940, two more (Ezra Stiles College and Morse College) opened in 1962, and two more (Pauli Murray College and Benjamin Franklin College) in 2017.

===Admission and exclusion===
For most of its history, study at Yale was almost exclusively restricted to white Protestant men, often the children of alumni. Documented exceptions to this paradigm include Hawaiian native Henry ʻŌpūkahaʻia, who became a student of Yale President Timothy Dwight in 1809, and black abolitionist James W. C. Pennington, who was allowed to audit theology courses in 1837. Moses Simons, a descendant of a slave-holding South Carolinian family, has been suggested to be the first Jew to graduate from Yale. Though his maternal ancestry is disputed, he may have also been the first person of African-American descent to graduate from any American college. In 1854, Yung Wing graduated from the college and became the first student from China to graduate from an American university, and in 1857, Richard Henry Green became the first African-American man to receive a degree from the college. Until the rediscovery of Green&#x27;s ethnic descent in 2014, physicist Edward Bouchet, who stayed at Yale to become the first African-American PhD recipient, was believed to also be the first African-American graduate of Yale College.

In the early 20th century, the student body was predominantly &quot;old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians&quot;—a group later called WASPs. By the 1970s, it was much more diverse.

Enrollment at Yale only became competitive in the early 20th century, requiring the college to set up an admissions process. As late as the 1950s, tests and demographic questionnaires for admission to the college worked to exclude non-Christian men, especially Jews, as well as non-white men. By the mid-1960s, these processes were becoming more meritocratic, allowing for the recruitment of a racially, economically, and geographically diverse student body. This meritocratic transition encouraged the university to establish the first need-blind admissions policy in the United States. After several decades of debate about coeducation, Yale College admitted its first class of women in 1969.

In recent years, the college has focused on international recruitment, quadrupling the fraction of international students admitted between 1993 and 2013.

==Organization==

Yale College is a constituent school of Yale University and contains a dependent system of residential colleges. Its executive officer is the Dean of Yale College, who is appointed to a five-year term by the Yale Corporation. The dean oversees undergraduate academic curriculum, extracurricular activities, and student discipline, but does not have direct control over the residential colleges. The position is currently held by Pericles Lewis, professor of comparative literature.

All of the college&#x27;s faculty are members of the Yale Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are thereby jointly affiliated with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Tenured members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences constitute the Board of Permanent Officers, who govern the school&#x27;s curriculum and programs. Most undergraduate courses and majors are offered under the purview of academic departments, divisions of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences which offer undergraduate and graduate curricula. In addition, the faculties of three Yale professional schools, the School of Art, School of Architecture and School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies, also offer undergraduate programs.

Residential colleges, which are funded and controlled by the university, have separate administration and limited self-governance. The Heads of College (before 2016 called Masters), usually tenured faculty members, are appointed to renewable, five-year terms by the Yale Corporation to oversee the affairs of each college. Residential college deans, who are supervised by the Dean of Yale College, are in charge of undergraduate academic oversight. Each residential college is governed by its Head of College, Dean, and Fellows, and has a college council of students with limited jurisdiction over student affairs. Issues affecting multiple colleges are governed by the Council of the Heads of College, composed of the Heads of College of the fourteen colleges.

==Residential colleges==

The most distinctive feature of Yale College undergraduate life is the residential college system. The system was established in 1933, through a gift by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness, who admired the college systems at Oxford University and Cambridge University. Each college consists of dormitory buildings surrounding an enclosed courtyard, and features a dining hall, library, and student facilities ranging from printing presses to darkrooms. Each is led by a Head of College, a faculty member who serves as its chief administrator, and a Dean, who oversees student academic affairs. University faculty and distinguished affiliates are associated with the colleges as fellows. Unlike their English forerunners, the colleges do not administer academic degree programs or courses of study, but they do sponsor academic seminars that fall outside the normal departmental structure of the university, and the Heads of College host lectures and teas for the colleges that attract high-profile visitors.

Harkness&#x27; gift built and endowed eight colleges, completed from 1932 to 1934. Additional colleges were opened in 1935 (Timothy Dwight College), 1940 (Silliman College), 1962 (Morse College and Ezra Stiles College), and 2017 (Pauli Murray College and Benjamin Franklin College), bringing the present-day number to fourteen. The first ten colleges were designed in Collegiate Gothic and Georgian Revival styles; the two colleges built in the 1960s are Modernist reinventions of the college plan. In 2007, Yale announced the construction of two additional Collegiate Gothic residential colleges near Science Hill, which opened in 2017.

==Student organizations==
===Singing groups===
Yale College has been called &quot;the epicenter of college singing,&quot; both for its long history of singing groups and its centrality in establishing collegiate a cappella in the United States. The earliest choral group, the Beethoven Society, dates to 1812 and emerged in the mid-nineteenth century as the Yale Glee Club. Although glee clubs around the country had spawned small collegiate ensembles since that time, the all-senior, all-male Whiffenpoofs, formed in 1909, are often considered to be the oldest collegiate a cappella society in the United States. Formalizing a style pioneered by black barbershop groups in New Haven, their repertoire was amplified by the founding of similar groups across the country. Coeducation in 1969 made possible all-women&#x27;s groups and mixed groups. In all, there are now at least eighteen undergraduate a cappella groups in Yale College, ranging from a Slavic chorus to Christian a cappella.

===Publications===
Student publications at Yale date back as far as 1806, but the earliest still in print, the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot;, was founded in 1836 and is believed to be the oldest surviving literary review in the United States. Undergraduate publications like the &quot;Yale Banner&quot;, a yearbook, and &quot;The Yale Record&quot;, a humor magazine, followed suit, often around the same time similar publications were established at Harvard and Princeton. The &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, established in 1878, was a relative latecomer but became the flagship campus daily, and continues to publish during every weekday of the undergraduate academic term. These publications have been joined by many 20th-century debuts, including &quot;The Yale Herald&quot; and &quot;The New Journal&quot;.

===Secret societies===

In 1832, a rift over Phi Beta Kappa inductions between the college&#x27;s two debating societies, Linonia and Brothers in Unity, caused seniors to establish the first secret society at the university, Skull and Bones. Skull and Bones &quot;tapped&quot; select juniors for membership as seniors, a ritual later adopted by all undergraduate senior societies. Since then, senior societies have proliferated at Yale, with recent estimates of 41 existing societies and senior class membership ranging from ten to fifty percent of each class. Although once carefully guarded, the &quot;secrecy&quot; of these senior societies is dubious; their existence is widely known and membership rolls for most are published yearly. Ten present-day societies—Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Book and Snake, Wolf&#x27;s Head, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, and Mace and Chain—have private buildings near campus; many other societies have a fixed on-campus meeting space where they meet twice a week. Some of the oldest society buildings are enclosed and windowless; members refer to them as &quot;tombs.&quot;

Their activities have varied over time and across societies, but most societies meet for dinners, discussion, drinking, and long-form disclosure of members&#x27; life history. Despite a long history of social exclusion—of Jews and women in particular—many of these societies have prioritized membership diversity in the last several decades. The semi-secrecy and influential membership of Yale&#x27;s older senior societies has attracted wide interest and scrutiny, particularly when both 2004 U.S. presidential candidates were members of Skull and Bones.

<text>The treecreepers are a family, Certhiidae, of small passerine birds, widespread in wooded regions of the Northern Hemisphere and sub-Saharan Africa. The family contains eleven species in two genera, &quot;Certhia&quot; and &quot;Salpornis&quot;. Their plumage is dull-coloured, and as their name implies, they climb over the surface of trees in search of food.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family consists of two subfamilies, each with one genus. Their distinctive anatomical and behavioural characteristics are discussed in their respective articles.
*Subfamily Certhiinae, genus &quot;Certhia&quot;, is the typical treecreepers, with eight species found in Europe and Asia, and one, the brown creeper, in North America.
*Subfamily Salpornithinae, genus &quot;Salpornis&quot;, contains only the Indian spotted creeper and African spotted creeper.

Some taxonomists place the nuthatches and treecreepers in a larger grouping with the wrens and gnatcatchers. This superfamily, the Certhioidea, was based on phylogenetic studies using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and was created to cover a clade of four families removed from a larger grouping of passerine birds, the Sylvioidea. The fossil record for this group appears to be restricted to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which has been identified as an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as &quot;Certhiops rummeli&quot;.

The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;kerthios&quot;, a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others.

There are two other small bird families with &quot;treecreeper&quot; or &quot;creeper&quot; in their name, which are not closely related:
* the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae)
* the Philippine creepers (Rhabdornithidae)

The wallcreeper was originally described in the family Certhiidae but is now considered as more closely related to the nuthatches. The woodcreepers (subfamily Dendrocolaptinae) also have a similar name.

===Species in taxonomic order===
* Genus &quot;Certhia&quot;
**Eurasian treecreeper or common treecreeper, &quot;Certhia familiaris&quot;
**Hodgson&#x27;s treecreeper, &quot;Certhia hodgsoni&quot;
**Brown creeper, &quot;Certhia americana&quot;
**Short-toed treecreeper, &quot;Certhia brachydactyla&quot;
**Bar-tailed treecreeper or Himalayan treecreeper, &quot;Certhia himalayana&quot;
**Sichuan treecreeper, &quot;Certhia tianquanensis&quot;
**Rusty-flanked treecreeper or Nepal treecreeper, &quot;Certhia nipalensis&quot;
**Sikkim treecreeper or brown-throated treecreeper, &quot;Certhia discolor&quot;
**Hume&#x27;s treecreeper, &quot;Certhia manipurensis&quot;
* Genus &quot;Salpornis&quot;
**Indian spotted creeper, &quot;Salpornis spilonotus&quot;
**African spotted creeper, &quot;Salpornis salvadori&quot;
An extinct treecreeper, &quot;Certhia rummeli&quot;, was described from a fossilized right tarsometatarsus found in karstic fissure fillings in Petersbuch, Bavaria by German paleornithologist Albrecht Manegold. This specimen implies the branching of Certhioidea occurred 20 MYA, and represents the oldest fossil passerine assignable to an extant subordinated clade of oscines in the Northern Hemisphere.

==Description==
Treecreepers measure from 12 to 18 centimetres in length. Their bills are gently down-curved and rather long, used for probing bark for insects and spiders. They often climb up tree trunks in a helical path, hopping with their feet together; their toes are long and tipped with strongly curved claws for gripping. The longer tails of the &quot;Certhia&quot; treecreepers are stiffened to use as a prop while climbing, but those of the spotted creeper are shorter and not stiffened. Their songs and calls are thin and high-pitched.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most species of treecreeper occur in the Palearctic and Indomalayan realms, from Western Europe to Japan and India. One species occurs in North America from Alaska to Nicaragua and another has a discontinuous distribution in sub-Saharan Africa and India. All species of treecreeper are found in forest and woodland habitats. The more northerly species are partly migratory, and those found in warmer climates are thought to be resident, although information is lacking for many species.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Treecreepers are generally unobtrusive and are often indifferent to humans. They occur as singles or in pairs, sometimes in small family groups after fledging. Communal roosting has been observed in three species (and may occur in more), with as many as 20 birds sharing a roosting hole in order to conserve warmth.

Treecreepers forage on the trunks of large trees. They move up the trunk in a progression of small hops. They fly to the bottom of a tree, then climb in a spiral fashion searching for prey. The majority of their diet is composed of small invertebrates, including insects and their larvae, spiders, and pseudoscorpions. In hard times seeds and fruits may be taken, and a few species will also visit birdfeeders. Species in both genera have been recorded joining mixed-species feeding flocks.

The treecreepers are monogamous and territorial. Nests and eggs vary between the genera: the &quot;Certhia&quot; treecreepers usually nest in a gap between the tree bark and the tree, whereas the nest of the spotted creeper is placed in the fork of a branch. Incubation lasts 14 to 15 days, and young fledge after 15 to 16 days.

<text>The Philippine creepers or rhabdornises are small passerine birds and form the genus Rhabdornis. They are endemic to the Philippines. They do not migrate, other than to make local movements.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Rhabdornis&quot; was introduced in 1853 by German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach to accommodate the stripe-headed rhabdornis. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;rhabdos&quot; meaning &quot;stripe&quot; with &quot;ornis&quot; meaning &quot;bird.&quot;

The relationship of the Philippine creepers to other bird species was formerly uncertain and the genus &quot;Rhabdornis&quot; was placed in its own family Rhabdornithinae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the Philippine creepers are aberrant members of the starling family Sturnidae.

The genus contains four species:
* Stripe-headed rhabdornis, stripe-headed rhabdornis or stripe-sided rhabdornis, &quot;Rhabdornis mystacalis&quot;
* Grand rhabdornis, long-billed rhabdornis or grand rhabdornis, &quot;Rhabdornis grandis&quot;
* Stripe-breasted rhabdornis, plain-headed creeper or stripe-breasted rhabdornis, &quot;Rhabdornis inornatus&quot;
*Visayan rhabdornis, &quot;Rhabdornis rabori&quot;

==Description==
The Philippine creepers are similar in appearance to treecreepers (Certhiidae). They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which they can use to extricate insects from bark, but they have brush-like tongues, which enable them to also feed on nectar.

<doc id="216499" wikidata="Q1193086" url="?curid=216499" title="Indian spotted creeper">
<text>The Indian spotted creeper (Salpornis spilonota) is a small passerine bird, which is a member of the subfamily Salpornithinae which is placed along with the treecreepers in the family Certhiidae. This small bird has a marbled black and white plumage that makes it difficult to spot as it forages on the trunks of dark, deeply fissured trees where it picks out insect prey using its curved bill. It is found in patchily distributed localities mainly in the dry scrub and open deciduous forests of northern and central peninsular India. It does not migrate. Their inclusion along with the treecreepers is not certain and some studies find them more closely related to the nuthatches while others suggest a close relation to the wallcreeper. They lack the stiff tail feathers of treecreepers and do not use their tail for supporting them while creeping vertically along tree trunks.

==Description==
The Indian spotted creeper has grey and white spotted and barred plumage, clearly different from the treecreepers of the subfamily Certhiinae. It weighs up to 16 grams, twice as much as treecreepers of similar length (up to 15 cm). The Indian spotted creeper has a thin pointed down-curved bill, a bit longer than the head, that it uses to extricate insects from bark, but it lacks the stiff tail feathers which treecreepers use to prop themselves on the vertical surface of tree trunks. They have a whitish supercilium contrasting with a dark eye stripe and white on the throat. The wing is long and pointed with a highly reduced first primary feather. The tail has twelve feathers and is square tailed. The sexes are identical in plumage.

The tarsus is stout and they have a long hind claw (average 8.9 ± 0.48 (s.d.) mm). The bill is 25.9±1.29 mm, the length of the wing is 88.5±2.76 mm and the tail is 53.8±2.05 mm long.

== Classification and naming ==
This species was first described by Major James Franklin in 1831 who provided a brief description in Latin and placed it in the genus &quot;Certhia&quot; as &quot;Certhia spilonota&quot; while noting that the tail feathers were not stiff as is typical for the genus. George Robert Gray at the British Museum erected the genus &quot;Salpornis&quot; and placed this species in it as &quot;Salpornis spilonota&quot;. When similar species were found in Africa, they were added as subspecies of the Indian species. It was only in 2010 that molecular, morpholological and vocal differences were studied, which resulted in the African species being considered distinct species. Scholars of nomenclature emended the ending &quot;spilonota&quot; which is suited for the feminine gender &quot;Certhia&quot; to the masculine form &quot;spilonotus&quot; to match the placement in the genus &quot;Salpornis&quot;. In 2014, Dickinson &amp; Christidis cited the rule that the species group epithet is invariable, so the species name was changed back to the spelling used in the original description as &quot;spilonota&quot;. Older works use the name &quot;spotted grey creeper&quot;.

The genus itself is placed in the family Certhiidae despite being significantly different from other members. Molecular studies show ambiguity in their relations to the nuthatches in the genus &quot;Sitta&quot; to which they may be closer or to the genus &quot;Tichodroma&quot;, which are basal within the superfamily Certhioidea.

==Distribution and habitat==

The African spotted creeper was formerly considered conspecific. Together they were called spotted creeper. The Indian species is nowhere common but is found in locations scattered around parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, central India (Bandhavgarh, Jabalpur, Bastar district) Orissa, northern Andhra Pradesh (Adilabad, Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary). In the past the slightly paler plumaged population in the arid zone of the Aravalli hills was separated as a subspecies &quot;rajputanae&quot; by Richard Meinertzhagen (and his wife) but this is treated as part of a single population and combined into a single (nominate) subspecies.

The species is found mainly in habitats having trees with deeply fissured bark including those of &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Diospyros&quot;, &quot;Tectona&quot; and mango.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The species is found singly or in mixed species flocks, foraging on the trunks of trees. It has an undulating flight and moves up the trunk, starting off from near the base, sometimes on horizontal branches. When flying down to the base of a tree, it has the clumsy appearance of a quail landing in grass. They resemble nuthatches in the way they work up and down the trunk and do not work in the spiral manner of treecreepers. The tail is held away and sometimes clings upside down. They feed on small insects and spiders on the bark.

Their calls are a series of rising &quot;tui-tui-tui&quot; notes and the song is a plaintive series of whistled notes &quot;tsip-tsee tuu tuui-tuwee&quot; having the quality of that of sunbird.

The breeding season is February to May. The nest is a cup made of roots and stalks placed at the junction of a horizontal branch and the vertical trunk, often near a knot or other outgrowth that makes it very difficult to spot. The nest walls are pliant and soft but strong. The surface is decorated with spider webs, caterpillar frass and lichen. The inner lining is made from spider webs and other fine material. The usual clutch consists of two eggs, which are greenish or gray, spotted darker brown and blotched pale. The female alone incubates the eggs and is fed by the male with which it keeps in contact with a twittering call. Both parents take part in feeding the chicks.

<text>A mail-order bride is a woman who lists herself in catalogs and is selected by a man for marriage. In the twentieth century, the trend primarily involved women living in developing countries seeking men from more developed nations. Men who list themselves in such publications are referred to as &quot;mail-order husbands&quot;, although this is much less common. As of 2002, there were an estimated 100,000–150,000 mail order brides worldwide.

The term &quot;mail-order bride&quot; has been criticized by international marriage agencies, who nevertheless continue to use it as an easily recognizable term. Women of Asian descent have also criticized the term, which they consider stigmatizing to women in such relationships. Consequently, some researchers have rejected the term.

==Demographics==
Around 100,000 to 150,000 women advertise themselves as mail-order brides globally. Of these, around 4,000 to 6,000 are married to American men every year, according to CIS estimates. More mail order brides originate from the Philippines than any other country, in spite of the illegality of mail order brides in the Philippines.

According to Robert Scholes, in a sample of 6,000 mail order brides, 76% were of Asian origin, while 28% originated from former Soviet Union countries such as Russia and Ukraine. A smaller portion were from Latin America. The majority of the American men who married foreign wives were white, highly educated, and successful.

Of the foreign brides given residence status in the United States in 2002, 50% were from East Asia (mainly China, Vietnam and the Philippines), 25% were from European countries (namely Russia and Ukraine), and 5% were from Latin America.

Owing to the large number of single men in rural Japan, mail-order brides from the Philippines became common in the 1990s, and in 2006 the number of such marriages peaked at 12,150. Although the number of marriages has dropped to less than 4,000, Filipinas still make up the largest number of foreign brides in Japan.

Due to the rising cost of paying for a bride in China, some Chinese men from working class communities have paid marriage brokers for wives from Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. Although many of the women from Vietnam willingly marry for love or economic reasons, some are kidnapped and sold by human traffickers. According to China&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security, 17,746 women were rescued from human traffickers in a period of less than two years.

==Motivations==
===East and Southeast Asia===
Many international brides come from developing countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and occasionally from South Asia as well. The countries the women come from are faced with unemployment, malnutrition and inflation. However, economic factors are not the only driving factor for women in Asia to enter the mail-order industry. In some cases women were recruited based on their physical appearance, with an emphasis placed on youth and virginity. This is found among boutique agencies, most of which cater to wealthy men from other Asian nations. During the 1990s, the majority of Asian mail-order brides came from the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and China.

In 2022, Monica Liu published findings which question the common assumption that mail-order brides in East Asia are often seeking marriage to escape poverty. She found that many marriage agencies in China cater to women from wealthy backgrounds. Liu found that in many cases, wealthy Chinese women sought Western, especially White American partners, because they are stereotyped within China as being more masculine and better able to satisfy women&#x27;s sexual and emotional needs. However, for the wealthiest Chinese women, the lower income of their foreign boyfriends was sometimes an impediment to marriage. 

According to Ericka Johnson, in Taiwan, many Taiwanese men seek Southeast Asian women as mail-order wives because they prefer hard-working women who will accept the drudges of daily housewife chores, while Taiwanese women reject this traditional view of a woman&#x27;s role in marriage. For this reason, Taiwanese women seek to marry Western mail-order husbands.

====Philippines====
Filipina women often entered the mail-order industry in the hope of marrying abroad, and then sponsoring their family for immigration.

===Eastern Europe===
Economic and social conditions for women in Russia and other Post-Soviet states are a motivational factor in finding foreign arrangements. The rise of Russian mail-order brides happened immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In testimony before the United States Senate, Professor Donna Hughes said that two-thirds of Ukrainian women interviewed wanted to live abroad and this rose to 97% in the resort city of Yalta.
====Russia====
In 1999 it was reported that women in Russia earned 43 percent of what men did. Marriage is a substantial part of Russian culture, with 30 years being the age at which a woman is considered an &quot;old maid&quot;.

==International marriage agencies==
An international marriage agency (also called an international introduction agency or international marriage broker) is a business that endeavors to introduce men and women of different countries for the purpose of marriage, dating, or correspondence. Many of these marriage agencies are based near women in developing countries (such as Colombia, China, Thailand, and the Philippines). International marriage agencies encourage women to register for their services, and facilitate communication and meetings with men from developed regions of Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, and Australia. This network of smaller international marriage agencies is often affiliated with web-based international dating sites that are able to market their services on a larger scale, in compliance with regulations such as the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act. Experian, a market research firm, reports that the top 10 international dating sites attracted 12 million visitors in March 2013, up 29% from March 2012. International dating sites provide a wide variety of online communication, including instant messaging, email letters, webchat, phone translation, virtual gifts, live games, and mobile-based chat. International marriage agencies are frequently referred to as &quot;mail-order bride&quot; agencies. However, many consider the term &quot;mail-order bride&quot; derogatory and feel it demeans foreign women by comparing them to commodities for sale and by falsely implying that (unlike local women), they exercise no judgment over the men they meet and would marry anyone from a relatively wealthy country.

Services offered by marriage agencies typically include:
*Offering a catalog with verified women&#x27;s profiles
*Introductions
*Platform for communication and interaction
*Translation of correspondence between clients not speaking a common language
*Excursions, in which a man is introduced to several women interested in marriage 

==History==

===17th and 18th centuries===

====British colonies====

In 1620, the Virginia Company recruited mail-order brides for the Jamestown colony, sponsoring the emigration of 140 women in hopes of reducing desertion by the settlers and to avoid the men marrying women from the local Native American tribes. They were sometimes referred to as &quot;tobacco wives&quot;, because each male colonist who married a mail-order bride had to reimburse the company for her passage at a cost of 120 pounds of &quot;good leaf tobacco&quot;. The women who were brought over by the company were free to marry whomever they chose, even men who were too poor to pay their passage fee. The average age of these brides was 20.

====French colonies====
France took a similar tactic in the mid-1600s, recruiting and sponsoring approximately 800 women to emigrate to New France. These mail-order brides were known as the filles du roi ( or in the spelling of the era). The New France colony followed the same patterns as Jamestown: male settlers returned home or married Native American women and left the colony to live with their wives&#x27; tribes. For the filles du roi, the government not only paid to recruit and transport them, it also provided each woman with a dowry of at least 50 livres. As with the &quot;tobacco wives&quot; of Jamestown, the filles du roi had the right to choose their partners and could refuse any suitor. Genetic studies of French Canadians have suggested that millions of people in Canada today are descended from the filles du roi.

When New France began its Louisiana colony in 1699, it requested more mail-order brides. These were known as Pelican girls (for the first ship that brought women to the colony, &quot;Le Pélican&quot;). This program was not successful; the women had been recruited with false descriptions of the struggling colony and had many complaints about their treatment. When women in France heard of the terrible conditions and of how the Pelican girls had been treated, the government was unable to recruit many more mail-order brides. France had to resort to shipping over thieves and prostitutes, known as &quot;correction girls&quot;.

====Portuguese colonies====
The Órfãs do Rei (&quot;orphans of the king&quot;) were Portuguese girl orphans who were sent from Portugal to overseas colonies during the Portuguese Empire as part of Portugal&#x27;s colonization efforts. The orphans were married to native rulers or Portuguese settlers. Their fathers were Portuguese men who died in battle for the king. Both noble and non-noble girls were in the &quot;órfãs do rei&quot;. Many were sent to the colony of Brazil, and they ranged from 12 to 30 years of age.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
There are at least two historical roots of the mail-order bride industry that emerged in the 1800s in the American frontier: Asian workers in the frontier regions (although Asian workers were scattered throughout the world), and American men who had headed west across the United States to the frontier.

====Asian immigrants====
Asian men worked through mail-order agencies to find wives as they worked overseas in the 1800s. Key variables determining the relationship between migration and marriage were demographics, legal policies, cultural perceptions and technology. Imbalances between the number of available women and the number of men desiring partners created a demand for immigrant women. As a result of this imbalance, a new system of &quot;picture brides&quot; developed in predominantly male settlements. In the early 20th century, the institution of &quot;picture brides&quot; developed due to immigration restrictions. The Japanese-American Passport Agreement of 1907 allowed Japan to grant passports to the wives of immigrants to America. As immigration of unmarried Japanese women to America was effectively barred, the use of &quot;picture brides&quot; provided a mechanism for willing women to obtain a passport to America, while Japanese workers in America could gain a female helpmate of their own nationality.

====European immigrants====
European American men sought financial success in the migration West, but few women lived there at this time, so it was hard for these men to settle down and start a family. During the California gold rush in 1849, there were at least three men for every woman, and by 1852 the ratio had increased to nearly seven men for every woman. They attempted to attract women living back East; the men wrote letters to churches and published personal advertisements in magazines and newspapers. In return, the women would write to the men and send them photographs of themselves. Courtship was conducted by letter, until a woman agreed to marry a man she had never met. Many women wanted to escape their present way of living, gain financial security and see what life on the frontier could offer them. Most of these women were single, but some were widows, divorcées or runaways. Mail-order marriages gave Black women an escape from the crushing racial restrictions in the South. In 1885, a group of married Black women in Arizona Territory formed the Busy Bee Club to advertise for wives for Arizona miners, hoping to reduce violence in the mining camps and encourage Black women to move to the area.

To recruit mail-order brides for Oregon, area bachelors combined funds to send two brothers east. The Benton brothers began their search in Maryland, posting &quot;Brides Wanted&quot; flyers. They held meetings at which they described the territory and promised free passage west. More than 100 women accompanied the Bentons back to Oregon. Asa Mercer performed a similar recruiting role for Seattle. Only 11 women accompanied Mercer back on his first trip, but his second was more successful, with more than 100 women travelling to Seattle, accompanied by a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist to chronicle the journey. These prospective brides were known as Mercer Girls.

British Columbia welcomed sixty women from Britain, mail-order brides recruited by the Columbia Emigration Society, in 1862. Another twenty women from Australia were bound for Victoria but were convinced to stay in San Francisco when their ship docked there.

In the early 20th century, answering matrimonial ads was a route to entering the United States after immigration limits became more restrictive. It was also a means of escaping war-torn regions. In 1922, two ships docked in New York with 900 mail-order brides from Eastern European countries such as Turkey, Romania, Armenia, and Greece, fleeing the Greco-Turkish War.

In 2005, President Alexander Lukashenko attempted to regulate &quot;marriage agencies&quot; in Belarus and make it difficult for them to operate. However, since he failed to address the economic problems which have been the root cause of the issue, he has been unable to stop (or otherwise regulate) this activity.

===Cambodia===
Thousands of women from Cambodia were mail-order brides to men in South Korea. Viewing the practice as a form of human trafficking, in the 21st century the Cambodian government passed a number of laws, such as prohibiting marriage between Cambodian women and men over the age of 50, a ban on marriage between Cambodian women and Korean men, and a ban on marriages with foreigners (which was rescinded after six months).

===Canada===
Canadian immigration laws concerning mail-order brides have traditionally been similar to (but slightly less restrictive than) their U.S. counterparts; for instance, previously not requiring the Canadian citizen to prove minimum-income requirements (as has been a long-standing requirement of United States immigration laws). While there is still no formal requirement for a minimum salary, the sponsor must provide evidence of income (such as the T4 income tax slip from an employer) with their IMM 5481 Sponsorship Evaluation. Until 2001 Canada&#x27;s immigration policy designated mail-order brides under the &quot;family class&quot; to refer to spouses and dependents and &quot;fiancé(e)&quot; class for those intending to marry, with only limited recognition of externally married opposite-sex &quot;common law&quot; relationships; same-sex partners were processed as independent immigrants or under a discretionary provision for &quot;humane and compassionate&quot; considerations. In 2002, the Canadian Immigration Law was completely revised. One of the major changes was conjugal partner sponsorship, available for any two people (including same-sex couples) who have had conjugal relations, with &quot;a significant degree of attachment&quot; and &quot;mutually interdependent relationship&quot;, for at least one year.

There have been reported instances in which foreign spouses have abandoned their Canadian sponsors upon arrival in Canada or soon thereafter, often collecting welfare, which the sponsor is obligated to repay. In some of the cases, federal immigration authorities have made no attempt to revoke fraudulently-obtained landed immigrant status or deport the claimants, treating cases where one spouse is duped by the other as low-priority and difficult to prove.

A two-year conditional residence requirement (like that in force in Australia and the United States) was proposed in 2011 and is now applied to new arrivals.

===China===

China is one of the main source countries of East Asian mail-order brides. Vietnamese women are traveling to China as mail-order brides for rural Han Chinese men to earn money for their families and a rise in the standard of living, matchmaking between Chinese men and Vietnamese women has increased and has not been affected by troubled relations between Vietnam and China. Some Vietnamese women from Lào Cai who married Han Chinese men stated that among their reasons for doing so was that Vietnamese men beat their wives, engaged in affairs with mistresses, and refused to help their wives with chores while Han men actively helped their wives carry out chores and care for them. Cambodian women also travel to China as mail order brides for rural men. In the majority of cases, young women are persuaded by friends and relatives with an offer, and at least 5 percent of Vietnamese women in marriages to Chinese men are victims of human trafficking. There is no established bilateral cooperation between China and Vietnam to deal with the problematic aspects of undocumented, transnational marriages, since the Chinese marriage market crisis has been significantly alleviated by female immigrants. Despite prohibition, illegal border crossing and de facto marriage are common and uncontrollable.

===Colombia===
According to immigration statistics from the United States Department of Homeland Security, Colombia has ranked in the top 10 of countries since 1999 from which fiancées have emigrated for the United States. As well, the number of Colombians being admitted to the United States between 1999 and 2008 using fiancé visas (including children) has increased 321 percent.

A dissertation by Jasney E. Cogua-Lopez, &quot;Through the Prisms of Gender and Power: Agency in International Courtship between Colombian Women and American Men&quot;, suggests various reasons for this growth, including continuing cultural inequality between the sexes despite equality being codified in the country&#x27;s laws (honor killings were not made completely illegal until 1980).

Because of the large number of Colombians wishing to leave their country by marrying foreigners, a black market for marriages to foreigners has developed, with some people allegedly paying as much as 20 million pesos ($10,000) to illegal groups.

According to Colombia Decrees No. 2668/88 and 1556/89, passed in 1988, foreigners are allowed to marry nationals in the country provided they supply the proper paperwork, including a birth certificate and proof that both parties are not already married. A notary is required, but because the laws are open to interpretation, the requirements can vary from notary to notary.

===Japan===

During the 1980s and 1990s, local authorities started government-led initiatives encouraging marriage between women from other Asian countries and Japanese farmers due to the lack of Japanese women who wanted to live in the countryside. These Asian brides came from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and South Korea. The phenomenon of marrying women from other Asian countries later spread to urban parts of Japan as well.

===Philippines===
The Philippines prohibits the business of organizing or facilitating marriages between Filipinas and foreign men. The Philippine congress enacted the Anti Mail-Order Bride Law on 13 June 1990, as a result of stories in the local media about Filipinas being abused by their foreign husbands. Because of this, Filipinas often used &quot;reverse publications&quot; – publications in which &quot;men&quot; advertise themselves – to contact foreign men for marriage to Filipina women.

Successful prosecution under this statute is rare or non-existent as widespread deployment of the Internet in the mid-1990s brought a proliferation of websites operating outside the Philippines which legally remain beyond the reach of Filipino law. One Montana site profiled in an ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs report entitled &quot;Pinay Brides&quot; circumvented the restrictions by characterising its role as that of a travel agency. Thousands of Filipina women marry Americans each year.

===South Korea===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reports, &quot;Every month, hundreds of South Korean men fly to Vietnam, the Philippines, Nepal and Uzbekistan on special trips. An agent escorts each man to see many women in a single day, sometimes all gathered in the same hall&quot;. Although these marriages can be successful, in some cases immigrant wives are mistreated, misunderstood and separated from their Korean husbands. One method men use when choosing young girls as wives is &quot;Like a judge in a beauty pageant, the man interviews the women, many of them 20 years younger than he, and makes a choice&quot;. The British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; reports, &quot;Last year it was reported that more than 40,000 Vietnamese women have married South Korean men and migrated there.&quot; Cambodian women are also popular with Korean men seeking foreign brides, but in March 2010 the Cambodian government banned marriages to South Korean men.

&quot;The Korea Times&quot; reports that every year, thousands of Korean men sign up for matches with Filipina brides through agencies and by mail order. Based on data from the Korean government, there are 6,191 Filipinas in South Korea who are married to Koreans. After contacting a mail-order agency, the majority of Filipina mail-order brides met their husbands by attending &quot;show-ups&quot;, a meeting in which a group of Filipina women are brought to meet a Korean man who is looking for a wife. At the show-up the Korean man picks a prospective wife from among the group, and in a matter of days they are married.

An anthropological study on Filipina wives and Korean men by professor Kim Min-jung of the Department of Cultural Anthropology at Kangwon National University found that these Korean men find it difficult to marry Korean women, so they look for girls in poorer countries with difficult economic circumstances. The Korean men feel that because of the difficult circumstances from which the Filipina women come, cultural differences and the language barrier, they &quot;will not run away&quot;. Further, she said, Korean men characterize Southeast Asian women as friendly, hardworking (due to agrarian backgrounds), &quot;docile and obedient, able to speak English, and are familiar with Korean patriarchal culture&quot;.

A recent study by matchmaking firm Bien-Aller polled 274 single South Korean men through its website concerning motivations for marrying non-Korean women and found that men choose foreign brides primarily for one of four reasons. &quot;According to the poll, 32.1 percent of the men said they felt the biggest benefit of marrying foreign women is their lack of interest in their groom&#x27;s educational background and financial or social status. The next best reason was their belief that foreign brides would be submissive (23 percent), make their lives more comfortable (15.3 percent), and that the men would not have to get stressed about their in-laws (13.8 percent).&quot;

The majority of mail order brides from China to South Korea consist of Chinese citizens of Korean ethnicity.

====Violence against foreign brides in South Korea====
In June 2013, The Philippine embassy in Seoul reported that it had received many complaints from Filipinas who have married Korean men through mail-order, frequently becoming &quot;victims of grave abuses&quot;. The Philippine police rescued 29 mail-order brides on their way to marry South Korea men whom Chief Superintendent Reginald Villasanta, head of an organised crime task force, says were &quot;duped into promises of an instant wealthy life through marriage with Korean gentlemen&quot;. The women were advertised in online and offline &quot;catalogs&quot; to South Korean men. In many cases however, victims were fed false information about the background of their future spouse and family, and suffered abuse from the South Korean men, which led to &quot;abandonment of the marital home, separation and divorce&quot;, Villasanta said.

There have been several murders of mail-order brides in South Korea. On 24 May 2011, one South Korean man &quot;stabbed his Vietnamese wife to death while the couple&#x27;s 19-day-old baby lay next to her. The man, a farmer, had been matched up with his foreign bride through a broker. In 2010, another Vietnamese woman was killed by her husband a week after they were married. In 2008, a Vietnamese woman jumped from an apartment building to her death after being abused by her husband and mother-in-law.&quot;

In November 2009, Philippine Ambassador to South Korea Luis T. Cruz warned Filipina women against marrying Korean men. He said in recent months that the Philippine Embassy in Seoul has received complaints from Filipina wives of abuses committed by their Korean husbands that caused separation, divorce and abandonment. As language and cultural differences become an issue, the Filipina women are regarded as commodities bought for a price.

=== Malaysia ===
Mail-order brides travelled to Malaysia to marry Malaysian men. Mail-order brides include women from Vietnam, Indonesia, and China.

===Singapore===
Singapore has received Vietnamese women as mail order brides.

===Taiwan===

Vietnamese and Uzbek mail order brides have gone to Taiwan for marriage. Domestic violence and other problems that Vietnamese women faced during the marriages in Taiwan.

===Turkmenistan===
On 4 June 2001, Turkmenian President Saparmurat Niyazov (also known as Turkmenbashi) authorized a decree that required foreigners to pay a $50,000 fee to marry a Turkmen citizen (regardless of how they met), and to live in the country and own property for one year. Authorities indicated that the law was designed to protect women from being duped into abusive relationships.
In June 2005, Niyazov scrapped the $50,000 and the property-owning requirements.

===United States===
U.S. immigration law provides protection for brides once they arrive. &quot;In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act... Section 652 of this legislation specifically addresses the mail-order bride industry&quot;.

On 6 January 2006, President George W. Bush signed the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA) as part of the Violence Against Women Act.
In enacting IMBRA, Congress was responding to claims by the Tahirih Justice Center (TJC), a woman&#x27;s advocacy group, that mail-order brides were susceptible to domestic abuse because they are unfamiliar with the laws, language and customs of their new home. The TJC insisted that special legislation was needed to protect them. The TJC asked Congress to consider several notable cases mentioned in the Congressional Record. Critics of IMBRA claim that the TJC failed to ask Congress to consider the relative amount of abuse between mail-order bride couples and other couples (including the thousands of spousal murders that occurred in the US over the past 15 years).

Two federal lawsuits (&quot;European Connections &amp; Tours v. Gonzales&quot;, N.D. Ga. 2006; &quot;AODA v. Gonzales&quot;, S.D. Ohio 2006) sought to challenge IMBRA on constitutional grounds. The AODA case was terminated when the plaintiffs withdrew their claim. The European Connections case ended when the judge ruled against the plaintiff, finding the law constitutional regarding a dating company.

On 26 March 2007, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper dismissed with prejudice a suit for injunctive relief filed by European Connections, agreeing with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and TJC that IMBRA is a constitutional exercise of Congressional authority to regulate for-profit dating websites and agencies where the primary focus is on introducing Americans to foreigners. Additionally, the federal court specifically found that: &quot;the rates of domestic violence against immigrant women are much higher than those of the U.S. population&quot;. According to a compilation of disaggregated samples of Asian ethnicities from local communities, Asian women in the United States reported intimate physical and/or sexual violence of 21 to 55 percent in 2015. The judge also compared background checks on American men to background checks on firearm buyers by stating, &quot;However, just as the requirement to provide background information as a prerequisite to purchasing a firearm has not put gun manufacturers out of business, there is no reason to believe that IMBs will be driven from the marketplace by IMBRA&quot;.

====Legal issues====
Marriage agencies are legal in almost all countries. On 6 January 2006, the United States Congress enacted IMBRA, which requires certain actions of some businesses prior to selling a foreign woman&#x27;s address to a US citizen or resident or otherwise facilitating contact, including the following:
*The man must complete a questionnaire on his criminal and marital background
*The business must obtain the man&#x27;s record from the United States National Sex Offenders Public Registry database
*The questionnaire and record must be translated into the woman&#x27;s native language and provided to her
*The woman must certify that she agrees to permit communication
*A lifetime limit of two K-1 visas is imposed, with a waiver required for the approval of any subsequent fiancée visa

=====Visa regulations=====
To bring a spouse into the United States, Form I-130 must be filed, which is an immigrant petition on behalf of a relative. After that, a K-3/K-4 &amp; V-1/V-2 Entry Visa for Spouse must be filed. The Immigration and Nationalization Service advises that &quot;in some cases, it may be to a couple&#x27;s advantage to pursue a K-1 fiancée visa before getting married. In other cases, applicants may find that it is more cost effective to get married abroad and then apply for an immigrant visa overseas. In many cases, the K-1 visa application process takes just as long as the immigrant visa process&quot;. The cost of the visa may be around $2000. Couples must remain together at least two years. There were 849,000 female naturalized citizens between the ages of 20 and 29 and 2,084,000 women of the same age living without U.S. citizenship in 2016, accounting for 13.3% of the female population of that age bracket. &quot;Despite well over 2,000 mail-order marriages a year, there is no information on the amount of mail-order brides entering the United States. The purpose of this law is two-fold: to protect the safety of mail-order brides and to prevent fraud&quot;.

<text>Tree and Leaf is a small anthology of works by J. R. R. Tolkien published in 1964 and originally illustrated by Pauline Baynes which consisted of: 
* a revised version of an essay called &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; (originally published in 1947 in &quot;Essays Presented to Charles Williams&quot;)
* an allegorical short story called &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; (originally published in the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; in 1945).
Both pieces were re-issued in the collection &quot;The Tolkien Reader&quot; (1966), and have also appeared in various subsequent collections.
Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; was added to the 1988 second edition (), and his poem &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot; was added in the 2001 third edition ().

<text>Health Canada (HC; ) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health policy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal health-related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance with federal law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves extensive collaboration with various other federal- and provincial-level organizations in order to ensure the safety of food, health, and pharmaceutical products—including the regulation of health research and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.

The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of health—presently Mark Holland—as part of the federal health portfolio. The minister is aided by the associate minister of health, and minister of mental health and addictions—presently Ya&#x27;ara Saks. The deputy minister of health, the senior most civil servant within the department, is responsible for the day-to-day leadership and operations of the department and reports directly to the minister.

Originally created as the &quot;Department of Health&quot; in 1919—in the wake of the Spanish flu crisis—what is known as &quot;Health Canada&quot; today was formed in 1993 from the former Health and Welfare Canada department (established in 1944), which split into two separate units; the other department being Human Resources and Labour Canada.

The Compliance and Enforcement Directorate provides support to Health Canada by enforcing the laws and regulations pertaining to the production, distribution, importation, sale, and/or use of consumer products, including but not limited to: tobacco, pest control materials, drugs and medical devices, biologics, and natural health products.

The Directorate conducts inspections and investigations to ensure that products are safe, of good quality, and properly labelled and distributed, in order to better protect Canadians from potentially harmful products and consumables.

Compliance and Enforcement Directorate is divided into six distinct programs:
* Canada Vigilance Program
* Controlled Substances Program

=== Canada Vigilance Program ===
Health Canada&#x27;s Canada Vigilance Program (CVP) &quot;collects and assesses reports of suspected adverse reactions to health products marketed in Canada,&quot; including prescription and over-the-counter medications, natural health products, biotechnology products, vaccines, blood products, human cell products, human tissue products, human organs, disinfectants and radiopharmaceuticals. The program has been in effect since 1965.

Pharmacovigilance related to Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) is a shared responsibility between Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.

==Special access program==
Health Canada has a special access program that health care providers may use to request medications that are not currently commercially available in Canada.

==COVID-19 response==
The chief medical advisor of Health Canada, Supriya Sharma, as of April 2021, oversees the COVID-19 vaccine approval process in Canada. On 29 March 2021, Sharma supported the National Advisory Committee on Immunization&#x27;s declaration of a pause for the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canadians under the age of 55.

==Criticisms==
An editorial published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal has called for Health Canada to more strictly regulate natural health products. The editorial cited weaknesses in current legislation that allow natural health products to make baseless health claims, to neglect side-effects research prior to products reaching market, and to be sold without being evaluated by Health Canada.

On 10 September 2012, a report on CBC Television questioned the safety of drugs sold in North America. The Canadian Press reported that Health Canada is secretive regarding inspections about drugs manufactured overseas, leaving the public unsure about the safety of these drugs.

== Drug approvals process ==
Health Canada aims to provide responses to pharmaceutical innovators within 300 days of submitting a drug for review. However, for submissions filed between 2015 and 2019, only 33 percent received a response within that target. Fully 18 percent waited over a year, and almost 5 percent over two years. The average delay for a standard review was 335 days. Health Canada&#x27;s accelerated pathway for approval dubbed &quot;conditional compliance&quot; reduces its target timeline to 200 days, but its actual average delay was still 302 days, and only 8 percent of applicants received responses within the 200-day target.

It has been suggested that government entities should make use of rolling submissions, as was done for COVID-19 vaccines, to proceed with the examination of partially complete submissions and accept new information as it becomes available, and also that drugs already approved in other jurisdictions should be approved more rapidly to avoid redundancy.

<doc id="216531" wikidata="Q192139" url="?curid=216531" title="Neoconservatism">
<text>Neoconservatism (colloquially neocon) is a political movement which began in the United States during the 1960s among liberal hawks who became disenchanted with the increasingly pacifist Democratic Party along with the growing New Left and counterculture of the 1960s. Neoconservatives typically advocate the unilateral promotion of democracy and interventionism in international relations together with a militaristic and realist philosophy of &quot;peace through strength&quot;. They are known for espousing opposition to communism and radical politics.

Many adherents of neoconservatism became politically influential during Republican presidential administrations from the 1960s to the 2000s, peaking in influence during the presidency of George W. Bush, when they played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the Bush administration included Paul Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, Paul Bremer, and Douglas Feith.

Although U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had not self-identified as neoconservatives, they worked closely alongside neoconservative officials in designing key aspects of the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy; especially in their support for Israel, promotion of American influence in the Arab world and launching the war on terror. The Bush administration&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies were heavily influenced by major ideologues affiliated with neoconservatism, such as Bernard Lewis, Lulu Schwartz, Richard and Daniel Pipes, David Horowitz, and Robert Kagan.

Critics of neoconservatism have used the term to describe foreign policy and war hawks who support aggressive militarism or neocolonialism. Historically speaking, the term &quot;neoconservative&quot; refers to Americans who moved from the anti-Stalinist left to conservatism during the 1960s and 1970s. The movement had its intellectual roots in the magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, edited by Norman Podhoretz. They spoke out against the New Left, and in that way helped define the movement.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;neoconservative&quot; was popularized in the United States during 1973 by the socialist leader Michael Harrington, who used the term to define Daniel Bell, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Irving Kristol, whose ideologies differed from Harrington&#x27;s. Earlier during 1973, he had described some of the same ideas in a brief contribution to a symposium on welfare sponsored by &quot;Commentary&quot;.

The &quot;neoconservative&quot; label was adopted by Irving Kristol in his 1979 article &quot;Confessions of a True, Self-Confessed &#x27;Neoconservative. His ideas have been influential since the 1950s, when he co-founded and edited the magazine &quot;Encounter&quot;.

Another source was Norman Podhoretz, editor of the magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, from 1960 to 1995. By 1982, Podhoretz was terming himself a neoconservative in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; article titled &quot;The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan&#x27;s Foreign Policy&quot;.

The term itself was the product of a rejection among formerly self-identified liberals of what they considered a growing leftward turn of the Democratic Party in the 1970s. Neoconservatives perceived in the new left liberalism an ideological effort to distance the Democratic Party and American liberalism from Cold War liberalism as it was espoused by former Presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. After the Vietnam War, the anti-communist, internationalist and interventionist roots of this Cold War liberalism seemed increasingly brittle to the neoconservatives. As a consequence they migrated to the Republican Party and formed one pillar of the Reagan Coalition and of the conservative movement. Hence, they became Neo-conservatives.

== History ==

Through the 1950s and early 1960s, the future neoconservatives had endorsed the civil rights movement, racial integration, and Martin Luther King Jr. From the 1950s to the 1960s, liberals generally endorsed military action in order to prevent a communist victory in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

Neoconservatism was initiated by liberals&#x27; repudiation of the Cold War and by the &quot;New Politics&quot; of the American New Left, which Norman Podhoretz said was too sympathetic to the counterculture and too alienated from the majority of the population, and by the repudiation of &quot;anti-anticommunism&quot; by liberals, which included substantial endorsement of Marxist–Leninist politics by the New Left during the late 1960s. Some neoconservatives were particularly alarmed by what they believed were the antisemitic sentiments of Black Power advocates. Irving Kristol edited the journal &quot;The Public Interest&quot; (1965–2005), featuring economists and political scientists, which emphasized ways that government planning in the liberal state had produced unintended harmful consequences. Some early neoconservative political figures were disillusioned Democratic politicians and intellectuals, such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, who served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the Reagan administration. Some left-wing academics such as Frank Meyer and James Burnham eventually became associated with the conservative movement at this time.

A substantial number of neoconservatives were originally moderate socialists who were originally associated with the moderate wing of the Socialist Party of America (SP) and its successor party, the Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA). Max Shachtman, a former Trotskyist theorist who developed strong feelings of antipathy towards the New Left, had numerous devotees in the SDUSA with strong links to George Meany&#x27;s AFL-CIO. Following Shachtman and Meany, this faction led the SP to oppose immediate withdrawal from the Vietnam War and oppose George McGovern in the Democratic primary race and, to some extent, the general election. They also chose to cease their own party-building and concentrated on working within the Democratic Party, eventually influencing it through the Democratic Leadership Council. Thus the Socialist Party dissolved in 1972, and the SDUSA emerged that year. (Most of the left-wing of the party, led by Michael Harrington, immediately abandoned the SDUSA.) SDUSA leaders associated with neoconservatism include Carl Gershman, Penn Kemble, Joshua Muravchik and Bayard Rustin.

Norman Podhoretz&#x27;s magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, originally a journal of liberalism, became a major publication for neoconservatives during the 1970s. &quot;Commentary&quot; published an article by Jeane Kirkpatrick, an early and prototypical neoconservative. 

=== Rejecting the American New Left and McGovern&#x27;s New Politics ===
As the policies of the New Left made the Democrats increasingly leftist, these neoconservative intellectuals became disillusioned with President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society domestic programs. The influential 1970 bestseller &quot;The Real Majority&quot; by Ben Wattenberg expressed that the &quot;real majority&quot; of the electorate endorsed economic interventionism but also social conservatism and that it could be disastrous for Democrats to adopt liberal positions on certain social and crime issues.

The neoconservatives rejected the countercultural New Left and what they considered anti-Americanism in the non-interventionism of the activism against the Vietnam War. After the anti-war faction took control of the party during 1972 and nominated George McGovern, the Democrats among the neoconservatives endorsed Washington Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson for his unsuccessful 1972 and 1976 campaigns for president. Among those who worked for Jackson were the incipient neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz, Doug Feith, and Richard Perle. During the late 1970s, neoconservatives tended to endorse Ronald Reagan, the Republican who promised to confront Soviet expansionism. Neoconservatives organized in the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation to counter the liberal establishment. Author Keith Preston named the successful effort on behalf of neoconservatives such as George Will and Irving Kristol to cancel Reagan&#x27;s 1980 nomination of Mel Bradford, a Southern Paleoconservative academic whose regionalist focus and writings about Abraham Lincoln and Reconstruction alienated the more cosmopolitan and progress-oriented neoconservatives, to the leadership of the National Endowment for the Humanities in favor of longtime Democrat William Bennett as emblematic of the neoconservative movement establishing hegemony over mainstream American conservatism.
In another (2004) article, Michael Lind also wrote: 

=== Leo Strauss and his students ===
C. Bradley Thompson, a professor at Clemson University, claims that most influential neoconservatives refer explicitly to the theoretical ideas in the philosophy of Leo Strauss (1899–1973), although there are several writers who claim that in doing so they may draw upon meaning that Strauss himself did not endorse. Eugene Sheppard notes: &quot;Much scholarship tends to understand Strauss as an inspirational founder of American neoconservatism&quot;. Strauss was a refugee from Nazi Germany who taught at the New School for Social Research in New York (1938–1948) and the University of Chicago (1949–1969).

Strauss asserted that &quot;the crisis of the West consists in the West&#x27;s having become uncertain of its purpose&quot;. His solution was a restoration of the vital ideas and faith that in the past had sustained the moral purpose of the West. The Greek classics (classical republican and modern republican), political philosophy and the Judeo-Christian heritage are the essentials of the Great Tradition in Strauss&#x27;s work. Strauss emphasized the spirit of the Greek classics and Thomas G. West (1991) argues that for Strauss the American Founding Fathers were correct in their understanding of the classics in their principles of justice.

For Strauss, political community is defined by convictions about justice and happiness rather than by sovereignty and force. A classical liberal, he repudiated the philosophy of John Locke as a bridge to 20th-century historicism and nihilism and instead defended liberal democracy as closer to the spirit of the classics than other modern regimes. For Strauss, the American awareness of ineradicable evil in human nature and hence the need for morality, was a beneficial outgrowth of the pre-modern Western tradition. O&#x27;Neill (2009) notes that Strauss wrote little about American topics, but his students wrote a great deal and that Strauss&#x27;s influence caused his students to reject historicism and positivism as morally relativist positions. They instead promoted a so-called Aristotelian perspective on America that produced a qualified defense of its liberal constitutionalism. Strauss&#x27;s emphasis on moral clarity led the Straussians to develop an approach to international relations that Catherine and Michael Zuckert (2008) call Straussian Wilsonianism (or Straussian idealism), the defense of liberal democracy in the face of its vulnerability.

Strauss influenced &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; editor Bill Kristol, William Bennett, Newt Gingrich, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, as well as Paul Wolfowitz.

=== Jeane Kirkpatrick ===
A theory of neoconservative foreign policy during the final years of the Cold War was articulated by Jeane Kirkpatrick in &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;, published in &quot;Commentary Magazine&quot; during November 1979. Kirkpatrick criticized the foreign policy of Jimmy Carter, which endorsed détente with the Soviet Union. She later served the Reagan Administration as Ambassador to the United Nations.

==== Skepticism towards democracy promotion ====
In &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;, Kirkpatrick distinguished between authoritarian regimes and the totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union. She suggested that in some countries democracy was not tenable and the United States had a choice between endorsing authoritarian governments, which might evolve into democracies, or Marxist–Leninist regimes, which she argued had never been ended once they achieved totalitarian control. In such tragic circumstances, she argued that allying with authoritarian governments might be prudent. Kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally autocratic countries, the Carter administration had delivered those countries to Marxist–Leninists that were even more repressive. She further accused the Carter administration of a &quot;double standard&quot; and of never having applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to communist governments. The essay compares traditional autocracies and Communist regimes: 
Kirkpatrick concluded that while the United States should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries, it should not do so when the government risks violent overthrow and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation. She wrote: &quot;No idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments, anytime and anywhere, under any circumstances ... Decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits. In Britain, the road [to democratic government] took seven centuries to traverse. ... The speed with which armies collapse, bureaucracies abdicate, and social structures dissolve once the autocrat is removed frequently surprises American policymakers&quot;.
=== 1990s ===
During the 1990s, neoconservatives were once again opposed to the foreign policy establishment, both during the Republican Administration of President George H. W. Bush and that of his Democratic successor, President Bill Clinton. Many critics charged that the neoconservatives lost their influence as a result of the end of the Soviet Union.

After the decision of George H. W. Bush to leave Saddam Hussein in power after the first Iraq War during 1991, many neoconservatives considered this policy and the decision not to endorse indigenous dissident groups such as the Kurds and Shiites in their 1991–1992 resistance to Hussein as a betrayal of democratic principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174894&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of those same targets of criticism would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies. During 1992, referring to the first Iraq War, then United States Secretary of Defense and future Vice President Richard Cheney said: 

A key neoconservative policy-forming document, &quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Clean Break&quot; report) was published in 1996 by a study group of American-Jewish neoconservative strategists led by Richard Perle on the behest of newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The report called for a new, more aggressive Middle East policy on the part of the United States in defense of the interests of Israel, including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and the containment of Syria through a series of proxy wars, the outright rejection of any solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would include a Palestinian state, and an alliance between Israel, Turkey and Jordan against Iraq, Syria and Iran. Former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense and leading neoconservative Richard Perle was the &quot;Study Group Leader&quot;, but the final report included ideas from fellow neoconservatives, pro-Israel right-wingers and affiliates of Netanyahu&#x27;s Likud party, such as Douglas Feith, James Colbert, Charles Fairbanks Jr., Jonathan Torop, David Wurmser, Meyrav Wurmser, and IASPS president Robert Loewenberg.

Within a few years of the Gulf War in Iraq, many neoconservatives were endorsing the ousting of Saddam Hussein. On 19 February 1998, an open letter to President Clinton was published, signed by dozens of pundits, many identified with neoconservatism and later related groups such as the Project for the New American Century, urging decisive action to remove Saddam from power.

Neoconservatives were also members of the so-called &quot;Blue Team&quot;, which argued for a confrontational policy toward the People&#x27;s Republic of China (the communist government of mainland China) and for strong military and diplomatic endorsement of the Republic of China (also known as Taiwan), as they believed that China will be a threat to the United States in the future.

=== 2000s ===
==== Administration of George W. Bush ====
The Bush campaign and the early Bush administration did not exhibit strong endorsement of neoconservative principles. As a presidential candidate, Bush had argued for a restrained foreign policy, stating his opposition to the idea of nation-building. Also early in the administration, some neoconservatives criticized Bush&#x27;s administration as insufficiently supportive of Israel and suggested Bush&#x27;s foreign policies were not substantially different from those of President Clinton.
Bush&#x27;s policies changed dramatically immediately after the 11 September 2001 attacks.

During Bush&#x27;s State of the Union speech of January 2002, he named Iraq, Iran and North Korea as states that &quot;constitute an axis of evil&quot; and &quot;pose a grave and growing danger&quot;. Bush suggested the possibility of preemptive war: &quot;I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world&#x27;s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world&#x27;s most destructive weapons&quot;.

Some major defense and national-security persons have been quite critical of what they believed was a neoconservative influence in getting the United States to go to war against Iraq.

Former Nebraska Republican U.S. senator and Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, who has been critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s adoption of neoconservative ideology, in his book &quot;America: Our Next Chapter&quot; wrote: 

===== Bush Doctrine =====

The Bush Doctrine of preemptive war was stated explicitly in the National Security Council (NSC) text &quot;National Security Strategy of the United States&quot;. published 20 September 2002: &quot;We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed ... even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy&#x27;s attack. ... The United States will, if necessary, act preemptively&quot;.

The choice not to use the word &quot;preventive&quot; in the 2002 National Security Strategy and instead use the word &quot;preemptive&quot; was largely in anticipation of the widely perceived illegality of preventive attacks in international law via both Charter Law and Customary Law. In this context, disputes over the non-aggression principle in domestic and foreign policy, especially given the doctrine of preemption, alternatively impede and facilitate studies of the impact of libertarian precepts on neo-conservatism.

Policy analysts noted that the Bush Doctrine as stated in the 2002 NSC document had a strong resemblance to recommendations presented originally in a controversial Defense Planning Guidance draft written during 1992 by Paul Wolfowitz, during the first Bush administration.

The Bush Doctrine was greeted with accolades by many neoconservatives. When asked whether he agreed with the Bush Doctrine, Max Boot said he did and that &quot;I think [Bush is] exactly right to say we can&#x27;t sit back and wait for the next terrorist strike on Manhattan. We have to go out and stop the terrorists overseas. We have to play the role of the global policeman. ... But I also argue that we ought to go further&quot;. Discussing the significance of the Bush Doctrine, neoconservative writer Bill Kristol claimed: &quot;The world is a mess. And, I think, it&#x27;s very much to Bush&#x27;s credit that he&#x27;s gotten serious about dealing with it. ... The danger is not that we&#x27;re going to do too much. The danger is that we&#x27;re going to do too little&quot;.

==== 2008 presidential election and aftermath ====

John McCain, who was the Republican candidate for the 2008 United States presidential election, endorsed continuing the second Iraq War, &quot;the issue that is most clearly identified with the neoconservatives&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported further that his foreign policy views combined elements of neoconservatism and the main competing conservative opinion, pragmatism, also known as realism: 

Barack Obama campaigned for the Democratic nomination during 2008 by attacking his opponents, especially Hillary Clinton, for originally endorsing Bush&#x27;s Iraq-war policies. Obama maintained a selection of prominent military officials from the Bush administration including Robert Gates (Bush&#x27;s Defense Secretary) and David Petraeus (Bush&#x27;s ranking general in Iraq). Neoconservative politician Victoria Nuland, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO under Bush, was made United States Under Secretary of State by Obama.

=== 2010s and 2020s ===
By 2010, U.S. forces had switched from combat to a training role in Iraq and they left in 2011. The neocons had little influence in the Obama White House, and neo-conservatives have lost much influence in the Republican party since the rise of the Tea Party Movement.

Several neoconservatives played a major role in the Stop Trump movement in 2016, in opposition to the Republican presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, due to his criticism of interventionist foreign policies, as well as their perception of him as an &quot;authoritarian&quot; figure. After Trump took office, some neoconservatives joined his administration, such as John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Elliott Abrams and Nadia Schadlow. Neoconservatives have supported the Trump administration&#x27;s hawkish approach towards Iran and Venezuela, while opposing the administration&#x27;s withdrawal of troops from Syria and diplomatic outreach to North Korea. Although neoconservatives have served in the Trump administration, they have been observed to have been slowly overtaken by the nascent populist and national conservative movements, and to have struggled to adapt to a changing geopolitical atmosphere. The Lincoln Project, a political action committee consisting of current and former Republicans with the purpose of defeating Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election and Republican Senate candidates in the 2020 United States Senate elections, has been described as being primarily made of neoconservative activists seeking to return the Republican party to Bush-era ideology. Although Trump was not reelected and the Republicans failed to retain a majority in the Senate, surprising success in the 2020 United States House of Representatives elections and internal conflicts led to renewed questions about the strength of neoconservatism.

In the Biden administration, neoconservative Victoria Nuland retained the portfolio of Under Secretary of State she had held under Obama. President Joe Biden&#x27;s top diplomat for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, was also a neocon and a former Bush administration official. In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, neoconservatives including the Cheney family (Dick &amp; Liz) and Adam Kinzinger supported Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27; campaign. After losing the election, Harris&#x27; campaign team was criticized by those within the Democratic camp for allying with neoconservatives.

== Evolution of opinions ==
=== Usage and general views ===
During the early 1970s, socialist Michael Harrington was one of the first to use &quot;neoconservative&quot; in its modern meaning. He characterized neoconservatives as former leftistswhom he derided as &quot;socialists for Nixon&quot;who had become more conservative. These people tended to remain endorsers of social democracy, but distinguished themselves by allying with the Nixon administration with respect to foreign policy, especially by their endorsement of the Vietnam War and opposition to the Soviet Union. They still endorsed the welfare state, but not necessarily in its contemporary form.
 Irving Kristol remarked that a neoconservative is a &quot;&quot;, one who became more conservative after seeing the results of liberal policies. Kristol also distinguished three specific aspects of neoconservatism from previous types of conservatism: neo-conservatives had a forward-looking attitude from their liberal heritage, rather than the reactionary and dour attitude of previous conservatives; they had a meliorative attitude, proposing alternate reforms rather than simply attacking social liberal reforms; and they took philosophical ideas and ideologies very seriously.

During January 2009, at the end of President George W. Bush&#x27;s second term in office, Jonathan Clarke, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs and prominent critic of Neoconservatism, proposed the following as the &quot;main characteristics of neoconservatism&quot;: &quot;a tendency to see the world in binary good/evil terms&quot;, a &quot;low tolerance for diplomacy&quot;, a &quot;readiness to use military force&quot;, an &quot;emphasis on US unilateral action&quot;, a &quot;disdain for multilateral organizations&quot; and a &quot;focus on the Middle East&quot;.

=== Opinions concerning foreign policy ===

In foreign policy, the neoconservatives&#x27; main concern is to prevent the development of a new rival. Defense Planning Guidance, a document prepared during 1992 by Under Secretary for Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz, is regarded by Distinguished Professor of the Humanities John McGowan at the University of North Carolina as the &quot;quintessential statement of neoconservative thought&quot;. The report says: Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power.

According to Lead Editor of e-International Relations Stephen McGlinchey: &quot;Neo-conservatism is something of a chimera in modern politics. For its opponents it is a distinct political ideology that emphasizes the blending of military power with Wilsonian idealism, yet for its supporters it is more of a &#x27;persuasion&#x27; that individuals of many types drift into and out of. Regardless of which is more correct, it is now widely accepted that the neo-conservative impulse has been visible in modern American foreign policy and that it has left a distinct impact&quot;.

Neoconservatism first developed during the late 1960s as an effort to oppose the radical cultural changes occurring within the United States. Irving Kristol wrote: &quot;If there is any one thing that neoconservatives are unanimous about, it is their dislike of the counterculture&quot;. Norman Podhoretz agreed: &quot;Revulsion against the counterculture accounted for more converts to neoconservatism than any other single factor&quot;. Neoconservatives began to emphasize foreign issues during the mid-1970s.
In 1979, an early study by liberal Peter Steinfels concentrated on the ideas of Irving Kristol, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Daniel Bell. He noted that the stress on foreign affairs &quot;emerged after the New Left and the counterculture had dissolved as convincing foils for neoconservatism ... The essential source of their anxiety is not military or geopolitical or to be found overseas at all; it is domestic and cultural and ideological&quot;.

Neoconservative foreign policy is a descendant of so-called Wilsonian idealism. Neoconservatives endorse democracy promotion by the U.S. and other democracies, based on the conviction that natural rights are both universal and transcendent in nature. They criticized the United Nations and détente with the Soviet Union. On domestic policy, they endorse reductions in the welfare state, like European and Canadian conservatives. According to Norman Podhoretz, &quot;&#x27;the neo-conservatives dissociated themselves from the wholesale opposition to the welfare state which had marked American conservatism since the days of the New Deal&#x27; and ... while neoconservatives supported &#x27;setting certain limits&#x27; to the welfare state, those limits did not involve &#x27;issues of principle, such as the legitimate size and role of the central government in the American constitutional order&#x27; but were to be &#x27;determined by practical considerations&#x27;&quot;.

In April 2006, Robert Kagan wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Russia and China may be the greatest &quot;challenge liberalism faces today&quot;: 

Trying to describe the evolution within the neoconservative school of thought is bedeviled by the fact that a coherent version of Neoconservatism is difficult to distill from the various diverging voices who are nevertheless considered to be neoconservative. On the one hand were individuals such as former Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick
who embodied views that were hawkish yet still fundamentally in line with Realpolitik. The more institutionalized neoconservatism that exerted influence through think tanks, the media and government officials, rejected Realpolitik and thus the Kirkpatrick Doctrine. This rejection became an impetus to push for active US support for democratic transitions in various autocratic nations.

In the 1990s leading thinkers of this modern strand of the neoconservative school of thought, Robert Kagan and Bill Kristol, published an essay in which they lay out the basic tenants of what they call a Neo-Reaganite foreign policy. In it they reject a &quot;return to normalcy&quot; after the end of the Cold War and argue that the United States should instead double down on defending and extending the liberal International order. They trace the origin of their approach to foreign policy back to the foundation of the United States as a revolutionary, liberal capitalist republic. As opposed to advocates of Realpolitik, they argue that domestic politics and foreign policies are inextricably linked making it natural for any nation to be influenced by ideology, ideals and concepts of morality in their respective international conduct. Hence, this archetypical neoconservative position attempts to overcome the dichotomy of pragmatism and idealism emphasizing instead that a values-driven foreign policy is not just consistent with American historical tradition but that it is in the enlightened self-interest of the United States.

=== Views on economics ===
While neoconservatism is concerned primarily with foreign policy, there is also some discussion of internal economic policies. Neoconservatism generally endorses free markets and capitalism, favoring supply-side economics, but it has several disagreements with classical liberalism and fiscal conservatism. Irving Kristol states that neocons are more relaxed about budget deficits and tend to reject the Hayekian notion that the growth of government influence on society and public welfare is &quot;the road to serfdom&quot;. Indeed, to safeguard democracy, government intervention and budget deficits may sometimes be necessary, Kristol argues. After the so-called &quot;reconciliation with capitalism&quot;, self-identified &quot;neoconservatives&quot; frequently favored a reduced welfare state, but not its elimination.

Neoconservative ideology stresses that while free markets do provide material goods in an efficient way, they lack the moral guidance human beings need to fulfill their needs. They say that morality can be found only in tradition and that markets do pose questions that cannot be solved solely by economics, arguing: &quot;So, as the economy only makes up part of our lives, it must not be allowed to take over and entirely dictate to our society&quot;. Critics consider neoconservatism a bellicose and &quot;heroic&quot; ideology opposed to &quot;mercantile&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; virtues and therefore &quot;a variant of anti-economic thought&quot;. Political scientist Zeev Sternhell states: &quot;Neoconservatism has succeeded in convincing the great majority of Americans that the main questions that concern a society are not economic, and that social questions are really moral questions&quot;.

=== Friction with other conservatives ===
Many conservatives oppose neoconservative policies and have critical views on it. Disputes over the non-aggression principle in domestic and foreign policy, especially given the doctrine of preemption, can impede (and facilitate) studies of the impact of libertarian precepts on neo-conservatism, but that of course didn&#x27;t, and still doesn&#x27;t, stop pundits from publishing appraisals. For example, Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke (a libertarian based at Cato), in their 2004 book on neoconservatism, &quot;America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order&quot;, characterized the neoconservatives at that time as uniting around three common themes:

Responding to a question about neoconservatives in 2004, William F. Buckley Jr. said: &quot;I think those I know, which is most of them, are bright, informed and idealistic, but that they simply overrate the reach of U.S. power and influence&quot;.

=== Friction with paleoconservatism ===

Starting during the 1980s, disputes concerning Israel and public policy contributed to a conflict with paleoconservatives. Pat Buchanan terms neoconservatism &quot;a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology&quot;. Paul Gottfried has written that the neocons&#x27; call for &quot;permanent revolution&quot; exists independently of their beliefs about Israel, characterizing the neoconservatives as &quot;ranters out of a Dostoyevskian novel, who are out to practice permanent revolution courtesy of the U.S. government&quot; and questioning how anyone could mistake them for conservatives. What make neocons most dangerous are not their isolated ghetto hang-ups, like hating Germans and Southern whites and calling everyone and his cousin an anti-Semite, but the leftist revolutionary fury they express.He has also argued that domestic equality and the exportability of democracy are points of contention between them.

Paul Craig Roberts, United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy during the Reagan administration and associated with paleoconservatism stated in 2003 that &quot;there is nothing conservative about neoconservatives. Neocons hide behind &#x27;conservative&#x27; but they are in fact Jacobins. Jacobins were the 18th century French revolutionaries whose intention to remake Europe in revolutionary France&#x27;s image launched the Napoleonic Wars&quot;.

==== Trotskyism allegation ====
Critics have argued that since the founders of neo-conservatism included ex-Trotskyists, Trotskyist traits continue to characterize neo-conservative ideologies and practices. During the Reagan administration, the charge was made that the foreign policy of the Reagan administration was being managed by ex-Trotskyists. This claim was cited by , who was a neoconservative and former Trotskyist himself. This &quot;Trotskyist&quot; charge was repeated and widened by journalist Michael Lind during 2003 to assert a takeover of the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration by former Trotskyists; Lind&#x27;s &quot;amalgamation of the defense intellectuals with the traditions and theories of &#x27;the largely Jewish-American Trotskyist movement&#x27; [in Lind&#x27;s words]&quot; was criticized during 2003 by University of Michigan professor Alan M. Wald, who had discussed Trotskyism in his history of &quot;The New York Intellectuals&quot;.

The charge that neoconservativism is related to Leninism has also been made by Francis Fukuyama. He argued that both believe in the &quot;existence of a long-term process of social evolution&quot;, though neoconservatives seek to establish liberal democracy instead of communism. He wrote that neoconservatives &quot;believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will. Leninism was a tragedy in its Bolshevik version, and it has returned as farce when practiced by the United States. Neoconservatism, as both a political symbol and a body of thought, has evolved into something I can no longer support&quot;. However, these comparisons ignore anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist positions central to Leninism, which run contradictory to core neoconservative beliefs.

== Criticism ==
Critics of neoconservatism take issue with neoconservatives&#x27; support for interventionistic foreign policy. Critics from the left take issue with what they characterize as unilateralism and lack of concern with international consensus through organizations such as the United Nations.

Critics from both the left and right have assailed neoconservatives for the role Israel plays in their policies on the Middle East.

Neoconservatives respond by describing their shared opinion as a belief that national security is best attained by actively promoting freedom and democracy abroad as in the democratic peace theory through the endorsement of democracy, foreign aid and in certain cases military intervention. This is different from the traditional conservative tendency to endorse friendly regimes in matters of trade and anti-communism even at the expense of undermining existing democratic systems.

In a column on &quot;The New York Times&quot; named &quot;Years of Shame&quot; commemorating the tenth anniversary of 9/11, Paul Krugman criticized them for causing a supposedly entirely unrelated war.

=== Adherence to conservatism ===
Former Republican Congressman Ron Paul (now a Libertarian politician) has been a longtime critic of neoconservativism as an attack on freedom and the Constitution, including an extensive speech on the House floor addressing neoconservative beginnings and how neoconservatism is neither new nor conservative.

=== Imperialism and secrecy ===

John McGowan, professor of humanities at the University of North Carolina, states after an extensive review of neoconservative literature and theory that neoconservatives are attempting to build an American Empire, seen as successor to the British Empire, its goal being to perpetuate a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;. As imperialism is largely considered unacceptable by the American media, neoconservatives do not articulate their ideas and goals in a frank manner in public discourse. McGowan states:

<doc id="216537" wikidata="Q943091" url="?curid=216537" title="U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement">
<text>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE; ) is a federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Created by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2003 following the September 11th attacks, ICE&#x27;s stated mission is to protect the United States from cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety.

The ICE mission is executed through the enforcement of more than 400 federal statutes and focuses on customs violations, immigration enforcement, preventing terrorism and combating the illegal movement of people and goods. ICE has two primary and distinct law enforcement components, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), in addition to three supporting divisions: Management &amp; Program Administration, Office of Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).

Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which primarily deals with the deportation and removal of illegal immigrants, is among the most public and contentious functions of ICE. ERO maintains the custodial facilities used to detain people that are illegally present in the United States. In interior offices, ERO officers primarily conduct targeted enforcement operations to apprehend immigrants engaged in serious criminal activity. For example, in fiscal year 2020, 90% of those immigrants apprehended by ERO had criminal convictions or pending charges at the time of their administrative arrest. This FY 2020 arrest statistic includes 1,800 homicide related offenses, 1,600 kidnappings, 3,800 robberies, 37,000 assaults, and 10,000 sex crimes. At border offices, ERO officers receive and detain illegal immigrants apprehended by the United States Border Patrol. Illegal immigrants apprehended in the interior of the United States have significantly higher levels of criminal history than those arrested by ERO at the border.

ICE maintains domestic offices throughout the United States and detachments at major U.S. diplomatic missions overseas. ICE personnel (special agents and officers) do not patrol American borders; rather, that role is performed by the Border Patrol. ERO and HSI operate as two independent law enforcement agencies and have completely separate mission statements. HSI is focused on the disruption of transnational crime, where as ERO is responsible for the apprehension, detention and removal of illegal immigrants.

The acting director is Caleb Vitello. The agency has not had a Senate-confirmed director since Sarah Saldaña stepped down on January 20, 2017.

==History==

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was formed under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, following the September 11 attacks. With the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, the functions and jurisdictions of several border and revenue enforcement agencies were combined and consolidated into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Consequently, ICE is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security and a contributor to the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Force.

The agencies that were either moved entirely or merged in part into ICE included the criminal investigative and intelligence resources of the United States Customs Service, the criminal investigative, detention and deportation resources of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Federal Protective Service. The Federal Protective Service was later transferred from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate effective October 28, 2009. In 2003, Asa Hutchinson moved the Federal Air Marshals Service from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to ICE, but Michael Chertoff moved them back to the TSA in 2005.

The origins of HSI Special Agents date back to the formations of the United States Customs Service in 1789. The taxing of imports led to the creation of the Treasury Department and its sub-components (i.e. Division of Customs Chief and Revenue Marine (Revenue Cutter Service). Later, the Industrial Revolution led to some of the first immigration related laws targeting forced labor, human trafficking and child exploitation.

==Organization==
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for identifying and eliminating border, economic, transportation, and infrastructure security vulnerabilities. There is an estimate of about 20,000 ICE employees in approximately 400 offices within the United States and 53 countries.

The organization is composed of two law enforcement directorates (HSI and ERO) and several support divisions each headed by a director who reports to an executive associate director. The divisions of ICE provide investigation, interdiction and security services to the public and other law enforcement partners in the federal and local sectors.

The director of ICE is appointed at the sub-cabinet level by the president of the United States, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and reports directly to the secretary of homeland security.

===Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)===

HSI is the primary investigative arm of Department of Homeland Security and consists of more than 10,300 employees who are assigned throughout 30 SAC offices in the U.S. and 52 international offices (41 international sub-offices) across the world. Approximately 6,000 special agents (criminal investigators) are included among the over 10,300 HSI employees, making it the second largest investigative service in the United States, behind the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

HSI special agents investigate violations of more than 400 U.S. laws that threaten the national security of the United States such as counter-proliferation; human smuggling and trafficking; weapons smuggling and export enforcement; narcotics smuggling and trafficking; document and benefit fraud; the manufacturing, sale, and use of counterfeit immigration and identity documents; human rights violations; transnational gang activity; financial crimes, including money laundering and bulk cash smuggling; cyber crime; child exploitation and sex tourism; trade crimes such as commercial fraud and intellectual property theft; smuggling of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and other merchandise; mass-marketing fraud; art theft; international cultural property and antiquities crimes; and visa security. HSI agents can be requested to provide security for VIPs, and also augment the U.S. Secret Service during overtaxed times such as special security events and elections.

HSI was formerly known as the ICE Office of Investigations (OI). HSI special agents are Series 1811 criminal investigators and have the statutory authority to enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act (Title 8), U.S. customs laws (Title 19), general federal crimes (Title 18), the Controlled Substances Act (Title 21), with approval from the Department of Justice, as well as Titles 5, 6, 12, 22, 26, 28, 31, 46, 49, and 50 of the U.S. Code.

====HSI Domestic Operations====

The largest cadre of special agents are located within Domestic Operations. In FY 2020, HSI special agents made 31,915 criminal arrests, rescued or identified 1,012 child exploitation victims, and seized $341 million worth of counterfeit goods, 6,195 lbs of fentanyl and $1.8 billion in currency &amp; assets from criminal organizations.

HSI is a global leader in the fight against child exploitation, including the sexual exploitation of children; the production, advertisement and distribution of child pornography; and child sex tourism. HSI’s special agents and analysts prioritize the recovery and support of victims. They also work to educate children, parents, schools, and communities on the tactics of child predators. They also work to identify and arrest those possessing and distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

In 2006, Operation Flicker found that there were a number of government employees, including &quot;dozens of Pentagon staff and contractors with high-level security clearance&quot;, who had downloaded child pornography.

====HSI Office of Intelligence====
The Office of Intelligence is a subcomponent of HSI that employs a variety of special agents and intelligence research specialists to facilitate HSI&#x27;s tactical and strategic intelligence demands. Collectively, these intelligence professionals collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence for use by the operational elements of DHS. The Office of Intelligence works closely with the intelligence components of other federal, state, and local agencies. Many HSI field offices assign intelligence analysts to specific groups, such as financial crimes, counter-proliferation, narcotics, or document fraud; or they can be assigned to a residential intelligence unit, known as a Field Intelligence Group (FIG). HSI agents assigned to FIGs generally focus on Human Intelligence (HUMINT) collection.

====HSI International Operations====

International Operations, formerly known as the Office of International Affairs (OIA), is a subcomponent of HSI with agents stationed in 60 locations around the world. HSI&#x27;s foreign offices, known as attaché offices, work with foreign governments to identify and combat transnational criminal organizations before they threaten the United States. IO also facilitates domestic HSI investigations by providing intelligence from host countries, conducting collateral investigations, and facilitating international investigations conducted by field offices within the United States.

====HSI Special Response Teams====
Nineteen HSI field offices maintain a Special Response Team (SRT) that operates as a federal SWAT element for the office&#x27;s area of responsibility (AOR). SRT was founded under the U.S. Customs Service as the Warrant Entry and Tactical Team (WETT) and were renamed to SRT in 1998. The SRT handles HSI&#x27;s high-risk arrest and search warrants, barricaded subjects, rural area operations, VIP protection, sniper coverage for high-risk operations, and security for National Security Events. HSI&#x27;s active SRTs are located in Tampa, Miami, Arizona (Phoenix), New Orleans, Houston, New York, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Juan, Detroit, San Francisco, El Paso, Chicago, San Diego, Seattle, Buffalo, and Washington, D.C. There is also a team of instructors and coordinators stationed full-time in Columbus, Georgia. These teams primarily deploy to handle high-risk operations, but also assist in events such as Hurricane Katrina, the Haiti earthquake 2010, and other natural disasters around the globe.

SRT is a collateral duty open to HSI special agents assigned to an office with a certified team. To qualify, candidates must pass a physical fitness test, qualify with multiple firearms by shooting 90% or better in full tactical gear, and pass an oral interview process. If a candidate passes these stages and is voted on the local team, they are then designated &quot;Green Team&quot; members and allowed to train with the certified team members. Green Team members are eventually sent to the SRT Initial Certification Course at the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs, Tactical Operations Unit (OFTP/TOU) Fort Benning, Georgia, where they must pass additional physical fitness, firearms, scenario-based and written assessments. Out of approximately 6,500 special agents, there are currently only approximately 300 certified SRT members nationwide.

HSI SRTs often conduct training exercises with various federal, state and local teams, and also assist other teams during national events or large-scale operations that require multiple high-risk scenarios to be conducted simultaneously. The working relationship between the SRTs and the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s U.S. Special Operations Command has led to SOCOM providing the SRTs with excess mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs), firearms, and other gear designed for use by U.S. special operations forces.

===Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)===
ERO is responsible for enforcing the nation&#x27;s immigration laws and ensuring the departure of removable immigrants from the United States. ERO uses its detention and deportation officers to identify, arrest, and remove immigrants who violate U.S. immigration law. Deportation officers are responsible for the transportation and detention of immigrants in ICE custody to include the removal of immigrants to their country of origin. Deportation officers arrest immigrants for violations of U.S. immigration law, monitor cases during deportation proceedings, supervise released immigrants, and remove immigrants from the United States.

Deportation officers operate strategically placed Fugitive Operations Teams whose function is to locate, apprehend, and remove immigrants who have absconded from immigration proceedings and remain in the United States with outstanding warrants for deportation. Due to limited staffing, ERO Fugitive Operations typically target illegal immigrants with a history of serious criminal convictions (i.e. homicide, sexual assaults, aggravated felonies). ERO officers do not randomly target illegal immigrants for detention and civil arrest due to current case law and internal policies.

ERO manages the Secure Communities program which identifies removable immigrants located in jails and prisons. Fingerprints submitted as part of the normal criminal arrest and booking process will automatically check both the Next Generation Identification (NGI) of the FBI&#x27;s Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division and the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) of the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s US-VISIT Program.

ERO was formerly known as the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO).

===Other ICE Divisions===
The Office of State, Local and Tribal Coordination (OSLTC) is ICE&#x27;s primary outreach and communications component for state, local and tribal stakeholders. It is responsible for building and improving relationships, and coordinating activities with state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies and through public engagement. It also fosters and sustains relationships with federal, state and local government officials and coordinates ICE ACCESS programs (Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security).

The Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) provides legal advice, training and services to support the ICE mission and defends the interests of the United States in the administrative and federal courts.

The Office of Professional Responsibility is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct involving employees of ICE.

ICE Air is the aviation division of ICE that charters aircraft or books commercial flights to send deportees back to their home countries. There are 10 aircraft used to send deportees and has a working list of 185 countries. Deportees have legs and arms secured while boarding, handcuffs are removed during flight and all shackles removed upon disembarking.

ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) is a division that is responsible for providing direct patient care to approximately 13,500 detainees housed in 21 detention facilities throughout the nation. Their stated mission is to provide the best care to those in ICE custody, practicing on the core values of Integrity, Commitment, Accountability, Service, and Excellence. The IHSC team is made up of around 1,000 members that consist of US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers, healthcare professionals, and federal civil service workers.

===Former units===
The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) was aligned into ICE shortly after the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. On October 16, 2005, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff officially approved the transfer of the Federal Air Marshal Service from the Bureau of Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the TSA as part of a broader departmental reorganization to align functions consistent with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) &quot;Second Stage Review&quot; findings for:

*consolidating and strengthening aviation law enforcement and security at the Federal level;
*creating a common approach to stakeholder outreach; and
*improving the coordination and efficiency of aviation security operations.

As part of this realignment, the director of the Federal Air Marshal Service also became the assistant administrator for the TSA Office of Law Enforcement (OLE), which houses nearly all TSA law enforcement services.

The Federal Protective Service (FPS) was moved from the General Services Administration (GSA) to ICE upon the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The FPS was later moved out of ICE to the National Protection Programs Directorate.

Originally a part of the U.S. Customs Service&#x27;s Office of Investigations, the Office of Air and Marine (then called the Air and Marine Interdiction Division) was transferred to ICE in 2003 during the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the Office of Air and Marine Operations. Due in part to a 500 million dollar budgetary dispute between CBP and ICE, in 2004 ICE Air and Marine Operations was transferred to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP Air and Marine still works closely with ICE to support the agency&#x27;s domestic and international law enforcement operations.

The Office of Detention Policy and Planning was responsible developing and maintaining ICE&#x27;s National Detention Standards, which set out detailed rules for how immigration detainees were to be treated differently than criminal inmates. In April 2017, President Donald Trump decided to close the office and to stop including the standards in new jail contracts.

==Assistant Secretaries and Directors==
==Training==

Newly hired ICE law enforcement personnel receive their training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. FLETC is the largest law enforcement training facility in the United States. To meet division specific academic and practical instruction, the ICE academies vary in length from 4 to 6 months depending on the position. Furthermore, following graduation, all ICE law enforcement personnel undergo additional post academy training, as well as career-continuous training.

HSI Special Agent trainees must complete the inter-agency Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) and the HSI Special Agent Training Course (HSI SAT). HSI special agents also receive significantly advanced training regarding U.S. customs law, warrant service, advanced tactics, undercover operations, criminal interrogation, weapons of mass destruction, and other subjects routinely encountered by HSI special agents in the field. HSI Special Agents typically complete CITP in conjunction with other agencies (i.e. Secret Service, Diplomatic Security Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, and various Office of Inspector Generals, etc.). However, the agency specific HSI SAT course is only attended by HSI trainees and focuses on customs &amp; immigration related investigations.

ERO Officer trainees must complete the basic 13-week ERO academy. ERO deportation officers undergo several weeks of intensive Spanish language training prior to graduating.

Specific course curriculum is kept confidential, but both ERO officers and HSI special-agent new hires undergo training related to basic law enforcement tactics, immigration law, firearms training, emergency response driving, and Constitutional law.

==HSI requests separation from ICE==
In 2018, a total of 19 HSI special agents in Charge or SACs (who are the senior most officials in each investigative division) sent a letter to the DHS Secretary and asked to be formally separated from ICE. These 19 SACs explained that HSI&#x27;s investigative mission was repeatedly being hamstrung by ICE&#x27;s civil immigration enforcement mission. It appeared HSI Special Agents were routinely being confused for ERO Officers both by the public and state/local law enforcement agencies. These Senior Leaders requested HSI be restructured as a stand-alone agency analogous to the Secret Service. It was also stated &quot;No U.S. Department of Justice law enforcement agency is paired with another disparate entity, i.e., the FBI is not paired with the Bureau of Prisons or DEA.&quot; This letter was ultimately ignored by the administration and resulted in no institutional changes.

==Weapons and equipment==
Since the agency&#x27;s formation, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents and officers.

===Previously issued sidearms===
Initially when the agency was formed in 2003, the sidearms issued to its agents and officers were the weapons issued by the legacy agencies: the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The USCS issued sidearms were the Glock 17 and Glock 19 9mm pistols. The I&amp;NS issued sidearms were the Heckler &amp; Koch USP Compact or Beretta 96D .40 caliber pistols. Duty loads were hollow-point rounds.

In 2007 the agency selected the SIG-Sauer P229 DAK .40 caliber pistol as its agency issued sidearm loaded with hollow-point rounds. This weapon stayed in service from 2009 to 2020.

===Currently issued sidearms===
The agency&#x27;s current duty sidearm, is the SIG Sauer P320C (C for Carry) pistol, chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum hollow-point rounds, utilizing a striker-fired mechanism in lieu of a double action only hammer system.

The agency has a list of personally owned weapons that are authorized for duty and off duty carry. These weapons must be inspected and approved by the agency&#x27;s firearms unit. The agent and/or officer must qualify with the weapon every three months.

===Other firearms and non-lethal weapons===
HSI special agents and ERO officers are trained on standard shoulder fired weapons that include the M4 carbine, chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition and the 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun.

As non-lethal options, special agents and officers are armed with the expandable metal baton and pepper spray.

==In popular culture==
ICE special agents and officers have been depicted in a number of movies and documentaries.

===HSI special agents===

&quot;The Punisher&quot;: The lead female character portrays an HSI special agent.

&quot;Human Trafficking&quot;: Led by Mira Sorvino, this TV series highlights the role of HSI special agents in combating sex trafficking.

&quot;The Crossing&quot;: People from a war torn future start showing up in a small town, prompting HSI special agents to investigate.

&quot;The Shield&quot;: Actress Laurie Holden played a prominent recurring role in the final season of &quot;The Shield&quot; as Special Agent Olivia Murray. In the final episode, the main character (Vic Mackey) is forced to work for ICE as part of his immunity agreement.

&quot;Crossing Over&quot;: In this 2009 film Harrison Ford portrays ICE / Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Max Brogan, who during the film, investigates human smuggling, fraud, and murder. Brogan is world weary, honest, and tough. But he has not let the injustices of life that he has witnessed during his career make him cynical or uncaring.

&quot;Sound of Freedom&quot;: This Christian thriller film features a Special Agent working for HSI, who focusses on investigating child pornography.

&quot;Wire Room&quot;: This direct-to-video action movie features an HSI Special Agent involved in a surveillance operation.

===ERO officers===
&quot;Immigration Nation&quot;: Takes an unprecedented look into ICE operations that target fugitives.

==Transnational gangs==

In February 2005, ICE began Operation Community Shield, a national law enforcement initiative that targets violent transnational street gangs through the use of ICE&#x27;s broad law enforcement powers, including the unique and powerful authority to remove criminal immigrants, including illegal immigrants and legal permanent residents.

==Immigration law==
Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g) allows ICE to establish increased cooperation and communication with state, and local law enforcement agencies. Section 287(g) authorizes the secretary of homeland security to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, permitting designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions, pursuant to a memorandum of agreement (MOA), provided that the local law enforcement officers receive appropriate training and function under the supervision of sworn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Under 287(g), ICE provides state and local law enforcement with the training and subsequent authorization to identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.

The enforcement of immigration laws was historically supported by both major political parties within the United States. In 1995, then President Clinton (Democrat) stated the following in his State of the Union address: &quot;All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That&#x27;s why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal immigrants. In the budget I will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal immigrants who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal immigrants in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.&quot; Similarly in the 1996 State of the Union, then President Clinton (Democrat) stated the following: &quot;But there are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.&quot;

The 287(g) program is one of several ICE ACCESS (ICE &quot;Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security&quot;) programs that increase collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration enforcement agents.

Between 2009 and 2016, the Barack Obama administration oversaw the deporting of a record 2.4 million illegal immigrants who had entered the United States, earning him the nickname &quot;Deporter-In-Chief&quot; by Janet Murguía, the president of National Council of La Raza. According to ICE data, about 40% of those deported by ICE in 2015 had no criminal conviction, while a majority of those convicted were guilty of minor charges. However, this statistic is misleading, as the way in how deportations were counted was changed under the Bush administration and continued under the Obama administration. Before, people caught crossing the southern border were simply bused back and were not counted as deportations. However, with the change, these people were fingerprinted and added to the deportation tally, giving the Obama administration a record number of deportations.

===2021 Border Crisis===
The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 1.3 million illegal crossers in the first eight months of 2021; with a total of 1.6 million apprehensions in Fiscal Year 2021 (highest on record). This figure does not include a daily count of 1,000+ illegal migrants who successfully evade the Border Patrol. Many of these migrants are now coming from third party countries and filing asylum claims, which have log jammed DOJ administrative courts. Not all migrants come from Mexico alone, many have come from other areas, such as: South America, Eastern Europe, Turkey and India. of those who arrived in the United States, two thirds were adults without children. Inversely, there was a record of 145,000 children that arrived in the United States unaccompanied. For example, in FY 2014 there were 56,912 asylum claims, which jumped to 142,760 in FY 2017 and are now even higher. Most illegal immigrants are released into the United States after processing and ordered to report for a future court date. According to the American Immigration Council, 83% of non-detained immigrants with completed or pending removal cases attended all of their hearings and 96% of non-detained immigrants represented by a lawyer attended all of their hearings. This has been colloquially referred to by U.S. Conservatives as the Border Crisis, and it has become a significant problem to solve for presidential administrations.

==Cartel ambush of HSI Special Agent Jaime Zapata==
In 2011, HSI Special Agents Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila, while working in Mexico to combat the flow of illicit narcotics, were ambushed by members of the Los Zetas drug cartel. Special Agent Zapata was killed while Special Agent Avila suffered life-threatening injuries. This was the first assassination of U.S. law enforcement agents since the infamous and gruesome murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Camarena. Several members of the drug cartel were extradited to the U.S. and charged for the murders, however, the applicable statute revealed a potential loophole that made it inapplicable for violations committed outside the U.S. In November 2021, President Joe Biden signed the &quot;Jaime Zapata &amp; Victor Avila Federal Officers &amp; Employees Protection Act,&quot; which helped extend legal protection to all U.S. personnel working overseas.

==Kidnapping of HSI special agent==
In 2005, an undercover HSI special agent was kidnapped in Medellin by members of a Colombian drug cartel, who held him responsible for a buy/bust operation that resulted in the seizure of 217 kilos of cocaine. The agent was moved to a &quot;stash house&quot; where he was assaulted and faced a &quot;narco-trial.&quot; U.S. embassy officials eventually became aware of the kidnapping and notified senior officials within the Colombian government. The Colombian drug cartel members eventually obtained access to his hotel room safe and retrieved documents that revealed his true identity as a U.S. federal law enforcement officer. In order to avoid additional scrutiny from the Colombian Security Services, the drug cartel subsequently released the HSI special agent once they determined his true identity. The HSI agent eventually returned home safely and the subsequent investigation resulted in the extradition of several drug traffickers involved in the kidnapping.

==ERO detention centers==

ICE ERO operates detention centers throughout the United States that detain illegal immigrants who are apprehended and placed into removal proceedings. About 34,000 people are held in immigration detention on any given day, in over 500 detention centers, jails, and prisons nationwide. Those detained are both illegal immigrants apprehended by ERO and other agencies such as Border Patrol.

Due to the United States detention bed quota, mandated by Congress, that number will increase rather than decrease. The quota mandates at least 34,000 beds available for immigrants on any given day. Under the Trump administration, the number of people being detained on any given day increased to 52,500 in early June 2019.

===Corporate contracts===
Engineering and construction firm Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) released a press statement on January 24, 2006, that the company had been awarded a no-bid contingency contract from the Department of Homeland Security to support its ICE facilities in the event of an emergency. The maximum total value of the contract is $385 million and consists of a one-year base period with four one-year options. KBR held the previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005. The contract provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to expand existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contract may also provide migrant detention support to other government organizations in the event of an immigration emergency, the company said.

===Sexual abuse allegations===
&quot;The Intercept&quot; published a report by the DHS Office of Inspector General revealing that 1,224 sexual abuse complaints while in immigration custody were filed between January 2010 and June 2017. Contrary to ICE&#x27;s claims, only 2% of these complaints were investigated.
In 2020, the Kino Border Initiative received 442 reports of alleged abuse by US agents, meaning 18% of new arrivals were abused by a US official.

===Forced sterilization allegations===
In 2020, multiple human rights groups joined a whistleblower to accuse a private-owned U.S. immigration detention centre in Georgia of forcibly sterilizing women. The reports claimed a doctor conducted unauthorized medical procedures on women detained by ICE. The whistleblower, Dawn Wooten, was a nurse and former employee. She claims a high rate of sterilizations were performed on Spanish-speaking women and women who spoke various Indigenous languages common in Latin America. Wooten said the centre did not obtain proper consent for these surgeries, or lied to women about the medical procedures.

More than 40 women submitted testimony in writing to document these abuses, one attorney said. Jerry Flores, a faculty member at the University of Toronto Mississauga said the alleged treatment of women constituted a violation of human rights and genocide according to the standards of the United Nations. &quot;Just Security&quot; of the New York University School of Law said the U.S. bore &quot;international responsibility for the forced sterilization of women in ICE detention&quot;. In September 2020, Mexico demanded more information from US authorities on medical procedures performed on migrants in detention centers, after allegations that six Mexican women were sterilized without their consent. Another woman said she had undergone a gynecological operation, although there was nothing in her detention file to support she agreed to the procedure.

===Allegations of pork and expired meals to Muslim detainees===
In 2020, CNN reported that Muslim detainees at a federal immigration facility in Miami, Florida, were repeatedly served pork or pork-based products against their religious beliefs, according to claims made by immigrant advocates. There are dozens of Muslim detainees at the facility for whom it is religiously forbidden to consume pork, civil rights groups said in a letter to ICE and federal oversight agencies. The Muslim detainees at the Krome detention facility in Miami were forced to accept pork because religiously compliant/halal meals that ICE served had been consistently rotten and expired. In one instance, the Chaplain at Krome&#x27;s allegedly dismissed pleas from Muslim detainees for help, saying, &quot;It is what it is.&quot;

A letter by civil rights lawyers stated &quot;Many have suffered illness, like stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea, as a result.&quot; An ICE spokesman said, &quot;Any claim that ICE denies reasonable and equitable opportunity for persons to observe their religious dietary practices is false.&quot; Representatives of the facility, including the chaplain did not respond to requests for comment. Previously in 2019, a Pakistani-born man with a valid American work permit was reportedly given nothing but pork sandwiches for six consecutive days.

===Wrongful detention allegations===
From 2012 to early 2018, ICE wrongfully arrested and detained 1,488 U.S. citizens, including many who spent months or years in immigration detention. A 2018 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; investigation found that ICE&#x27;s reliance on incomplete and error-prone databases and lax investigations led to the erroneous detentions. From 2008 to 2018, ICE was sued for wrongful arrest by more than two dozen U.S. citizens, who had been detained for periods ranging from one day to over three years. Some of the wrongfully detained U.S. citizens had been arrested by ICE more than once. The inaccurate government data that ICE used had shown that both immigrants and U.S. citizens were both targets of being detained. In 2019, a U.S. citizen that was detained stated that he lost 26 pounds from the horrendous conditions that the detention center offered.

===Separation of illegal migrant children from families by ICE ERO===

As part of the 2018 Trump administration&#x27;s zero tolerance policy, nearly 3,000 minors were separated from their parents, or the adults accompanying them, while trying to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border and placed in detention camps. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; likened these centers to &quot;prisons&quot; while &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; reported that a movement swelled online to call them &quot;concentration camps.&quot; Similarly, former first lady of the United States Laura Bush compared the images of the centers to U.S. Japanese internment camps during the Second World War. 16 out of 34 of the centers located in Texas had previously been cited by Texas officials for more than 150 health violations. The former head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Sandweg, was critical of child separation, telling NBC News, &quot;You could easily end up in a situation where the gap between a parent&#x27;s deportation and a child&#x27;s deportation is years,&quot; and that many children might never see their parents again.

Detained children have also been given up for adoption. In a series of court cases, foster families were successfully able to gain full custody of migrant children that they were housing without notifying their parents. Most notably, the agency Bethany Christian Services, an agency that facilitates the care of foster children in Michigan has been criticized for promoting adoption of migrant children instead of trying to reunite them with their families. In a previous Facebook post, they had waived the previous $550 international adoption application fee for the month of June. This had led to public outcry and protests have been held against this agency and their practices.

This policy in particular has led to the Abolish ICE movement gaining traction in June 2018.

==Sanctuary cities==

Sanctuary cities are cities that limit their cooperation with ICE ERO, particularly in regards to illegal migrants arrested for state criminal violations. When an illegal immigrant is arrested by state or local police for criminal offenses, their information is placed into a federal database that ERO officers can access. In a non-sanctuary city, ERO Officers can ask the police to hold that person after they would normally have been released until ERO can pick them up. However, sanctuary cities believe this is unconstitutional and view being an illegal immigrant as not a crime but a civil violation. As such, policies or ordinances in these cities prevent the police from continuing to hold a person based on an ERO request if that person was otherwise cleared for release.

Sanctuary cities were one of the many focal points for the Trump administration&#x27;s attempts to reform the country&#x27;s immigration policies. In early 2017, President Trump issued an executive order to deny sanctuary cities federal grants if they did not comply with ICE. By November 2017, this order was struck down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Despite this, the Trump administration continued to seek ways to challenge sanctuary cities, such as implementing a policy that preferentially awards policing grants that cooperate with ICE.

==Protests==

Numerous protests have emerged across the nation in response to the Trump administration&#x27;s ICE policies. Many of the protesters are occupying areas around ICE facilities in hopes of disrupting operations. The Occupy ICE movement began on June 17, 2018, outside Portland, Oregon. It initially began as a vigil for the people suffering from ICE policies but spontaneously grew into a larger movement as more people showed up. The movement ultimately spread into other major cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Diego, and New York. As the movement grew, they faced counter protesters and arrests, but protesters remained undeterred and vowed to continue fighting the Trump administration&#x27;s ICE policies. As Occupy ICE groups spread to different cities, there has also been a greater amount of coordination between them. Other grassroots protests have sprung up across the nation as well. On August 1, 2019, a month-long peaceful protest event was started outside the San Francisco ICE office, where protesters beat drums and demanded that family separation at the border be stopped. In addition to blocking ICE facilities, protesters are also protesting technology companies such as Microsoft for providing technology to aid ICE. One such instance of this was the sit in at the Microsoft store on 5th Avenue in NYC led by Close the Camps NYC on September 14, 2019. In the 2020 protests and riots in Portland, Oregon, the local ICE office had its window broken.

<doc id="216547" wikidata="Q1060476" url="?curid=216547" title="Spinifex hopping mouse">
<text>The spinifex hopping mouse (Notomys alexis), also known as the tarkawara or tarrkawarra, occurs throughout the central and western Australian arid zones, occupying both spinifex-covered sand flats and stabilised sand dunes, and loamy mulga and melaleuca flats.

The population fluctuates greatly: in normal years it is sparsely distributed and probably confined to sandy country; after rain the population explodes and spreads to other types of habitat for a time.

They are mostly seen at night, bounding across open ground on their large hind feet, with tails extended and the body almost horizontal.

As semi-fossorial, burrowing surface foragers, the tiny hopping mice spend a great deal of energy not just foraging for food, but also transporting it back to their burrows. In fact, it was found that the total energy spent on transporting food in relation to energy investment on burrows far outweighed any other similar type of species (White, 2006).

==Appearance==
The appearance is very similar to the northern hopping mouse: slightly larger than a common house mouse at head-body length and an average weight of . As with all hopping mice, the hind legs are greatly elongated, the fore limbs small, and the brush-tipped tail very long—about . The fur is chestnut or fawn above, pale below, with a grey wash about the muzzle and between the eye and ear, and longer, coarse black guard hairs on the back. The tail is sparsely furred and pink, darker above than below.

Spinifex hopping mice live in small family groups of up to 10 individuals in deep, humid burrow systems. Typically, there is a large nest chamber lined with small sticks and other plant material about a metre below the surface, from which several vertical shafts lead upwards. Shaft entrances do not have spoil heaps.

==Breeding==
Breeding can be at any time of year depending on conditions, with spring being favoured. Pregnancy usually takes 38–41 days but can be prolonged significantly if the mother is still suckling the previous brood. Litters of three or four are typical, six being the maximum. The young remain in the nest while the female forages; if they wander both male and female adults retrieve them. They reach sexual maturity in about two and a half months. After mating, a copulatory plug is formed in the female&#x27;s reproductive tract.

The spinifex hopping mouse is widespread and although the population fluctuates considerably, is not considered at risk.

==As pets==
Previously, spinifex hopping mice could be kept as pets in Victoria and ACT (Australia), but a Basic Wildlife Licence was required. In 2013, Victorian regulations for the possession, use and trade of wildlife underwent a number of changes and as part of these reforms spinifex hopping mice were moved to Schedule 4B, which allows private ownership without a licence. Commercial breeding still requires a licence to prevent removal of mice from the wild. Pet owners should be aware of the potential parasite and disease risks, including mites and helminths, and in very rare cases even melanoma.

Captive populations of spinifex hopping mice are useful for small scale research, and can be used for developing management tools to assess the health status of those in captivity.

<text>Aziz Saleh al-Numan [[Khafaja|al-Khafaji]] (; 1 July 1941 – 30 January 2024) was an Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party Regional Command Chairman. He was appointed Iraqi Governor of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War; taking over the post from Ali Hassan al-Majid in November 1990, and holding it until 27 February 1991. He previously served as Governor of Karbala (1976–1979), Governor of Najaf (1979–1986) and Minister of Agriculture (1986–1991).

==Biography==
Aziz Saleh al-Numan was born on 1 July 1941. He was a member of the &quot;dirty dozen&quot;, allegedly responsible for torture and murder in Iraq. Prior to the U.S. invasion in April 2003, Al-Numan was the Baath Party&#x27;s regional command chair, responsible for West Baghdad. He was previously the governor of Karbala and Najaf. 

He was taken into custody on 22 May 2003. At the time, he was the Number 8 on the Central Command&#x27;s list of the 55 most wanted Iraqis, and was the highest-ranking person on the list of 55 to have been taken into custody to that time. He was one of nine Iraqi leaders that the United States wished to see tried for either war crimes or crimes against humanity.

In 2011, he was transferred to Iraqi custody along with five others, tried and sentenced to death.

Al-Numan was the&quot; King of Diamonds&quot; in the US deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards.

He died on 30 January 2024, at the age of 82.

<doc id="216551" wikidata="Q1200532" url="?curid=216551" title="Repdigit">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a repdigit or sometimes monodigit is a natural number composed of repeated instances of the same digit in a positional number system (often implicitly decimal). The word is a portmanteau of &quot;repeated&quot; and &quot;digit&quot;.
Examples are 11, 666, 4444, and 999999. All repdigits are palindromic numbers and are multiples of repunits. Other well-known repdigits include the repunit primes and in particular the Mersenne primes (which are repdigits when represented in binary).

Any such number can be represented as follows

 formula_1

Where nn is the concatenation of n with n. k the number of concatenated n. 

nn can be represented mathematically as

formula_2

for n = 23 and k = 5, the formula will look like this 

formula_3

Also, any number can be decomposed into the sum and difference of the repdigit numbers.

For example 3453455634 = 3333333333 + (111111111 + (9999999 - (999999 - (11111 + (77 + (2))))))

Repdigits are the representation in base formula_4 of the number formula_5 where formula_6 is the number of repetitions. For example, the repdigit 77777 in base 10 is formula_7.

A variation of repdigits called Brazilian numbers are numbers that can be written as a repdigit in some base, not allowing the repdigit 11, and not allowing the single-digit numbers (or all numbers will be Brazilian). For example, 27 is a Brazilian number because 27 is the repdigit 33 in base 8, while 9 is not a Brazilian number because its only repdigit representation is 118, not allowed in the definition of Brazilian numbers. The representations of the form 11 are considered trivial and are disallowed in the definition of Brazilian numbers, because all natural numbers &quot;n&quot; greater than two have the representation 11&quot;n&quot; − 1. The first twenty Brazilian numbers are
: 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, ... .

On some websites (including imageboards like 4chan), it is considered an auspicious event when the sequentially-assigned ID number of a post is a repdigit, such as 22,222,222, which is one type of &quot;GET&quot; (others including round numbers like 34,000,000, or sequential digits like 12,345,678).

==History==
The concept of a repdigit has been studied under that name since at least 1974, and earlier called them &quot;monodigit numbers&quot;. The Brazilian numbers were introduced later, in 1994, in the 9th Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad that took place in Fortaleza, Brazil. The first problem in this competition, proposed by Mexico, was as follows: 

A number is called &quot;Brazilian&quot; if there exists an integer &quot;b&quot; such that for which the representation of &quot;n&quot; in base &quot;b&quot; is written with all equal digits. Prove that 1994 is Brazilian and that 1993 is not Brazilian.
==Primes and repunits==

For a repdigit to be prime, it must be a repunit (i.e. the repeating digit is 1) and have a prime number of digits in its base (except trivial single-digit numbers), since, for example, the repdigit 77777 is divisible by 7, in any base &gt; 7. In particular, as Brazilian repunits do not allow the number of digits to be exactly two, Brazilian primes must have an odd prime number of digits. Having an odd prime number of digits is not enough to guarantee that a repunit is prime; for instance, 21 = 1114 = 3 × 7 and 111 = 11110 = 3 × 37 are not prime. In any given base &quot;b&quot;, every repunit prime in that base with the exception of 11&quot;b&quot; (if it is prime) is a Brazilian prime. The smallest Brazilian primes are
:7 = 1112, 13 = 1113, 31 = 111112 = 1115, 43 = 1116, 73 = 1118, 127 = 11111112, 157 = 11112, ... 

While the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers is a divergent series, the sum of the reciprocals of the Brazilian prime numbers is a convergent series whose value, called the &quot;Brazilian primes constant&quot;, is slightly larger than 0.33 . This convergence implies that the Brazilian primes form a vanishingly small fraction of all prime numbers. For instance, among the 3.7×1010 prime numbers smaller than 1012, only 8.8×104 are Brazilian.

The decimal repunit primes have the form formula_8 for the values of &quot;n&quot; listed in . It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many decimal repunit primes. The binary repunits are the Mersenne numbers and the binary repunit primes are the Mersenne primes.

It is unknown whether there are infinitely many Brazilian primes. If the Bateman–Horn conjecture is true, then for every prime number of digits there would exist infinitely many repunit primes with that number of digits (and consequentially infinitely many Brazilian primes). Alternatively, if there are infinitely many decimal repunit primes, or infinitely many Mersenne primes, then there are infinitely many Brazilian primes. Because a vanishingly small fraction of primes are Brazilian, there are infinitely many non-Brazilian primes, forming the sequence
:2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 19, 23, 29, 37, 41, 47, 53, ... 

If a Fermat number formula_9 is prime, it is not Brazilian, but if it is composite, it is Brazilian.
Contradicting a previous conjecture, Resta, Marcus, Grantham, and Graves found examples of Sophie Germain primes that are Brazilian, the first one is 28792661 = 1111173.

==Non-Brazilian composites and repunit powers==
The only positive integers that can be non-Brazilian are 1, 6, the primes, and the squares of the primes, for every other number is the product of two factors &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with 1 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; − 1, and can be written as &quot;xx&quot; in base &quot;y&quot; − 1. If a square of a prime &quot;p&quot;2 is Brazilian, then prime &quot;p&quot; must satisfy the Diophantine equation &quot;p&quot;2 = 1 + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot;2 + ... + &quot;b&quot;&quot;q&quot;-1 with &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; ≥ 3 primes and &quot;b&quot; &gt;= 2.
Norwegian mathematician Trygve Nagell has proved that this equation has only one solution when &quot;p&quot; is prime corresponding to . Therefore, the only squared prime that is Brazilian is 112 = 121 = 111113.
There is also one more nontrivial repunit square, the solution (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) = (20, 7, 4) corresponding to 202 = 400 = 11117, but it is not exceptional with respect to the classification of Brazilian numbers because 20 is not prime.

Perfect powers that are repunits with three digits or more in some base &quot;b&quot; are described by the Diophantine equation of Nagell and Ljunggren&quot;n&quot;&quot;t&quot; = 1 + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot;2 +...+ &quot;b&quot;&quot;q&quot;-1 with &quot;b, n, t&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;q&quot; &gt; 2.
Yann Bugeaud and Maurice Mignotte conjecture that only three perfect powers are Brazilian repunits. They are 121, 343, and 400 , the two squares listed above and the cube 343 = 73 = 11118.

==&quot;k&quot;-Brazilian numbers==
* The number of ways such that a number &quot;n&quot; is Brazilian is in . Hence, there exist numbers that are non-Brazilian and others that are Brazilian; among these last integers, some are once Brazilian, others are twice Brazilian, or three times, or more. A number that is &quot;k&quot; times Brazilian is called &quot;k-Brazilian number&quot;.
*Non-Brazilian numbers or 0&quot;-Brazilian numbers&quot; are constituted with 1 and 6, together with some primes and some squares of primes. The sequence of the non-Brazilian numbers begins with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 23, 25, ... .
* The sequence of 1&quot;-Brazilian numbers&quot; is composed of other primes, the only square of prime that is Brazilian, 121, and composite numbers that are the product of only two distinct factors such that with . .
* The 2&quot;-Brazilian numbers&quot; consists of composites and only two primes: 31 and 8191. Indeed, according to Goormaghtigh conjecture, these two primes are the only known solutions of the Diophantine equation: formula_10 with &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot; &gt; 2 : 
**(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = (31, 5, 2, 3, 5) corresponding to 31 = 111112 = 1115, and,
**(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = (8191, 90, 2, 3, 13) corresponding to 8191 = 11111111111112 = 11190, with 11111111111 is the repunit with thirteen digits 1.
* For each sequence of &quot;k-Brazilian numbers&quot;, there exists a smallest term. The sequence with these smallest &quot;k&quot;-Brazilian numbers begins with 1, 7, 15, 24, 40, 60, 144, 120, 180, 336, 420, 360, ... and are in . For instance, 40 is the smallest &quot;4-Brazilian number&quot; with 40 = 11113 = 557 = 449 = 2219.
* In the &quot;Dictionnaire de (presque) tous les nombres entiers&quot;, Daniel Lignon proposes that an integer is &quot;highly Brazilian&quot; if it is a positive integer with more Brazilian representations than any smaller positive integer has. This definition comes from the definition of highly composite numbers created by Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1915. The first numbers &quot;highly Brazilian&quot; are 1, 7, 15, 24, 40, 60, 120, 180, 336, 360, 720, ... and are exactly in . From 360 to 321253732800 (maybe more), there are 80 successive highly composite numbers that are also highly Brazilian numbers, see .

==Numerology==
Some popular media publications have published articles suggesting that repunit numbers have numerological significance, describing them as &quot;angel numbers&quot;.

<doc id="216554" wikidata="Q462061" url="?curid=216554" title="Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri">
<text>Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri (; 1 July 1942 – 26 October 2020) was an Iraqi politician, army officer and field marshal. He served as Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council until the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and was regarded as the closest advisor and deputy under President Saddam Hussein. He led the Iraqi resistance group Naqshbandi Army. 

Al-Douri was the most high-profile Ba&#x27;athist official to successfully evade capture after the invasion of Iraq, and was the &quot;king of clubs&quot; in the infamous U.S. deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Al-Douri continued to lead elements of the Iraqi resistance such as the Naqshbandi Army against the then-occupation forces and waged an insurgency against the current regime in Baghdad. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December 2006, al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party on 3 January 2007.

In April 2015, the Shiite militant organization Asa&#x27;ib Ahl al-Haq claimed they had killed al-Douri and his nine bodyguards during a military operation near the Al-Alaas oil fields in Hemreen east of Tikrit. The group further alleged that his body had been transported to Baghdad to confirm its identity on 17 April 2015. Though the story was carried by the BBC, they also noted that the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath party denied that al-Douri had died, while a Kurdish news source reported that Iraq did not have al-Douri&#x27;s DNA to confirm his death. Al-Douri subsequently appeared in videos talking about events that took place after his supposed death. On 26 October 2020, news of his death was again carried by both local and international media, this time based on announcements by the Iraqi Ba-ath party and Raghad Hussein, the daughter of Saddam Hussein.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in 1942, al-Douri was born in Ad-Dawr, near the Iraqi town of Tikrit, to Ibrahim Khalil al-Douri, a farmer, and Hamdah Saloum al-Douri. His family belonged to the Sunni Muslim Al-Shuwaikhat clan of the Jabour tribe. Nicknamed &quot;the Iceman&quot; for his humble origins selling blocks of ice, he became involved in revolutionary politics in his late teenage years, despite having had only a primary school education. He befriended Saddam Hussein in 1963, then they both served in the early intelligence apparatus of the Ba&#x27;ath Party and participated in what would be known as the 17 July Revolution in 1968.

===During the Ba&#x27;athist government===
Al-Douri was a senior member of the Ba&#x27;athist government under Saddam Hussein. This was due to the fact that both al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. When the Ba&#x27;athists seized power in 1968, he was made interior minister where he oversaw efforts to sideline political rivals to the Ba&#x27;ath Party, mainly the Iraqi Communist Party. Al-Douri became the vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council prior to 2003, giving him unprecedented amounts of power and influence within the Iraqi political sphere.

As vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka &#x27;Chemical Ali&#x27;) to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja. He was complicit in the invasion of Saudi Arabia and the attack on the town of Khafji in January 1991. During the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, he was involved in the suppression of the revolt led by the Iraqi marsh Arabs. When the Kurds rebelled again in 1991, al-Douri warned them &quot;If you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to remind you that we are ready to repeat the operation.&quot;

In 1993, al-Douri was involved in the state-sponsored Return to Faith Campaign &quot;(al-Hamlah al-Imaniyyah)&quot;, which sought to encourage devotion to Islam in Iraqi social life. This saw aspects of Islam fused into the Iraqi media, education system and judicial system.

In October 1998, al-Douri escaped an assassination attempt when visiting Karbala.

Following the October 2000 events, Arab leaders including al-Douri gathered in Cairo condemning Israel&#x27;s reaction to the protests. In response to the Palestinian protests, Al-Douri was said to have remarked &quot;The Jews will be taught a lesson.&quot;

On 5 March 2003, during an emergency summit of the then Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation, al-Douri made a heated address where he accused the neighbouring Gulf states of being &quot;traitors&quot; for cooperating with the United States and Israel. He blamed Kuwait for being responsible for Iraq&#x27;s suffering and scrutinised the United States of America&#x27;s aggressive stance towards Iraq. These comments sparked the Kuwaiti representative to stand up and protest to which al-Douri responded &quot;Shut up, sit down you small American agent, you monkey!&quot;

Al-Douri, a member of the Naqshbandi Order, was able to use his position in the regime to leverage support to the Naqshbandi community within Iraq. This form of patronage would eventfully culminate in the rise of the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order during the Iraqi insurgency, of which al-Douri would play a leading role.

===Personal life===
Al-Douri married for the first time in 1968; however, he married five times in total and had 24 children: 13 daughters and 11 sons. In a sign of loyalty, al-Douri consented to marry his daughter Hawazin to Saddam&#x27;s eldest son, Uday. Al-Douri&#x27;s influence with Saddam was so substantial that he could even levy a condition, that the union would not be consummated, and later made a successful petition that his daughter be permitted to divorce Uday.

Al-Douri is believed to have suffered from leukemia and was said to have undergone blood transfusions every six months. In 1999, he visited Vienna, Austria for treatment. A Vienna city Councillor submitted an request for the arrest and investigation on al-Douri for war crimes, but the government allowed him to leave the country. His son was reportedly killed in Tikrit in July 2014.

==Fall of the Ba&#x27;ath regime and Iraqi insurgency==
===The 2003 US invasion of Iraq===
On 20 March 2003, U.S.-led coalition forces invaded Iraq, leading to the toppling of the regime of President Saddam Hussein on 9 April 2003. Following the fall of Baghdad, al-Douri went into hiding. U.S. officials claimed that he was involved in the subsequent Iraqi insurgency against U.S. forces, directing and funding attacks, as well as brokering an alliance between Ba&#x27;athist insurgents and militant Islamists.

In November 2003, the U.S.-led coalition issued a US$10 million bounty for any information leading to al-Douri&#x27;s apprehension by authorities in response to coordinating attacks against Coalition forces. One of al-Douri&#x27;s wives and a daughter were captured in the same month, to be questioned about his whereabouts.

Al-Douri was made the King of Clubs in the famous most-wanted Iraqi playing cards, making him among the top 8 &quot;most wanted&quot; figures in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

At the time of the invasion of Iraq, al-Douri, along with Saddam and Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, were among the three surviving plotters who had brought the Ba&#x27;ath Party to power in a coup in 1968.

===The Iraqi insurgency and disappearance ===
In an interview in May 2008, al-Douri detailed his strategy, indicating that &quot;any negotiations with the invaders without it represents a desertion and treason, and is refused by all national, Pan-Arab and Islamic factions of the resistance.&quot; During the interview, al-Douri made the following demands:

# An official pronounced recognition of the armed and unarmed national resistance, including all its factions and (political) parties, as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Iraq
# An official declaration of unconditional withdrawal from Iraq by the U.S. leadership
# Declaring null and void all the political and legislative institutions, as well as all the laws and legislation issued by them, since the occupation, with the de-Ba&#x27;athfication law in the forefront, and compensating all who were adversely affected by them
# A stop to raids, prosecutions, arrests, killings and displacement
# Release of all prisoners of war (POWs), prisoners and detainees without exception and compensating all for their physical and psychological damage
# Reinstating the army and the national security forces in service in accordance with their preoccupation laws and regulations, and compensating all who were adversely affected by dissolving them
# A pledge to compensate Iraq for all the material and moral losses it incurred because of the occupation

Al-Douri was reportedly the head of the Iraqi resistance group Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order as well as the Supreme Command for Jihad and Liberation based on his longstanding positions of leadership in the Naqshbandi sect in Iraq.

====Whereabouts====

Sometime after the Fall of Baghdad, al-Douri evaded capture and went into hiding. There are many different reports on his whereabouts. Several sources close to al-Douri&#x27;s family reported to Al Jazeera that they had not heard of al-Douri since April 2003 and did not know where he was hiding.

According to veteran intelligence consultant Malcolm Nance and a U.S. telegram cable, al-Douri and the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council were rumoured to have developed deep relations with Hafez al-Assad and the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath party, despite historical differences between the two Ba&#x27;ath factions. Al-Douri urged Saddam to open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. Nance would also allege that al-Douri fled to Syria after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency.

The RAND Corporation reported prior to the capture of Saddam Hussein, al-Douri served as &quot;Saddam’s point of contact in Diyala Governorate&quot; and that he had visited Diyala twice to meet with leaders to organize the insurgency inside Iraq.

There were reports from al-Hayat that al-Douri was allegedly in Mosul visiting his wife, before fleeing to an undisclosed location. NBC News reported that al-Douri was rumoured to be hiding in Syria or elsewhere.

In 2007, Iraqi security forces raided a hideout in Tikrit belonging to al-Douri, the raid was based on &quot;confirmed intelligence&quot; that al-Douri was holding meetings with his aides at the hideout. Al-Douri however was not caught. In early 2007, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani claimed al-Douri was not in Syria, but that he was in Yemen, saying that the Iraqi government has had this information for a while and had been tracing al-Douri&#x27;s movements. A U.S. intelligence source told the Long War Journal, that al-Douri was being sheltered in northern Iraq. Iraqi tribal expert and senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, Amatzia Baram, claimed that al-Douri is likely in hiding somewhere between Mosul and the Turkish border. Middle East expert Juan Cole believes that al-Douri is likely in the Mosul area and not Syria.

The U.S. claimed that al-Douri resurfaced in Syria in 2008, however, &quot;Al-Mawqif Al-Arabi&quot;, an Egyptian newspaper which interviewed al-Douri that same year, told reporters that he was &quot;on the battlefield&quot; and on a &quot;combat field while weapons were talking&quot;, presumably meaning he was still fighting in Iraq. The Combating Terrorism Center reported that al-Douri was still &quot;politically active within Iraq.&quot; The Irish Times reported that it was believed that al-Douri was hiding somewhere in Iraq. Likewise, The Times reported that it was believed that al-Douri was hiding around Mosul or Tikrit. Other reports claimed that al-Douri was in the Iraqi town of Ad-Dawr and Iraqi Kurdistan.

General David Petraeus who was at the time heading the United States Central Command, told reporters from Al Arabiya that al-Douri was still residing in Syria with &quot;complete freedom&quot;. The Syrian government denied that al-Douri was residing in Syria. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki claimed to U.S. officials that a Syrian offered to show him al-Douri&#x27;s home in Damascus during a visit. However, Iraqi intelligence sources in 2009 have emphasized that al-Douri was residing in the southern suburbs of Diyala in an Islamic State of Iraq stronghold.

Unconfirmed speculations located al-Douri somewhere in Gulf or the southern Arabian Peninsula, or in Qatar, while other theories claimed that al-Douri had stayed in Iraq permanently since 2003, or that he had &quot;a number of safe houses in and around Muqdadiya.&quot;

Despite allegations from U.S. and Iraqi officials that al-Douri was residing in Syria, al-Douri had opposed and even attempted to oust the Syrian-backed Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist, Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, from the party and he had also criticized the Syrian government for being part of an American conspiracy to undermine the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party. Furthermore, analysts have noted that &quot;Douri deeply distrusts working with the Syrians because he distrusts the Iranians, who are strong allies with Syria&quot;. In an interview on 26 May 2008, al-Douri boasted that his resistance was not supported or incubated by any outside powers.

Some leaders such as former national security advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie and former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused the Assad government of harbouring and supporting Iraqi militants. A charge Syria heavily denies and demands be proven with evidence.

While U.S. telegram cable claimed by at least October 2009 that al-Douri was no longer part of the &quot;former regime elements&quot; living in Syria, U.S. intelligence believed al-Douri operated out of Syria until the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, when he may have moved to safe houses across the North-western Iraq province of Nineveh. Malcolm Nance, however claims that al-Douri was still in Syria by as late as 2013, before moving to Tikrit in 2014.

===Iraqi insurgency and resurfacing===
On 10 November 2011, a man claiming to be Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri released an audio tape condemning a recent arrest campaign targeting suspected Ba&#x27;ath Party members.

The first visual evidence of his survival surfaced on 7 April 2012 when a video posted online showed him giving a speech. In the shots, he is seen wearing an olive Saddam-era military uniform (with the rank of Field Marshal) and glasses, denouncing the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and interference in Iraqi politics by regional Shia powerhouse Iran. &quot;Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening this country,&quot; al-Douri says during the hour-long broadcast. Prime Minister Maliki&#x27;s personal adviser, Ali al-Moussawi, said the tape had a propaganda function but that he doubted al-Douri was still in Iraq as he required extensive medical care for a number of illnesses.

On 5 January 2013, a 53-minute video was released on YouTube in which al-Douri encouraged recent Sunni protests in Nineveh and Anbar Governorates against Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, saying that &quot;the people of Iraq and all its nationalist and Islamic forces support you until the realization of your just demands for the fall of the Safavid-Persian alliance.&quot; The message, which showed the Ba&#x27;athist leader sitting behind a desk with a small Saddam-era Iraqi flag on it, was partially broadcast on the Al Arabiya news channel. In the video, released just before the Iraqi Army Day on 6 January, Douri claimed to be somewhere in Iraq&#x27;s Babil Governorate. However, former U.S. intelligence officials believe it was filmed in Damascus, Syria. Hours after the tape was released, Iraqi military intelligence arrested Abdul Rahman Mohammed Ibrahim, the nephew of al-Douri, in Saladin Governorate.

In April 2013, the Iraqi government claimed to be closing in on al-Douri, who they claimed was moving between Tikrit and the towns of Hawija and Dour, which is alleged to be an area of strong support for al-Douri, and also where he is claimed to have owned a villa. In 2014, al-Douri returned to Tikrit during the Iraqi Civil War.

==The fall of Mosul and Iraqi Civil War==
Al-Douri played a role in the Northern Iraq Offensive as commander of the Naqshbandi Army. Reports soon surfaced that he had links with the jihadist group ISIL, helping them take the city of Tikrit and coordinating attacks against Iraqi security forces. On 13 June, a Twitter account, @wikibaghdadi, claimed a &quot;Meeting between ISIS and Naqshbandi Army near al-Qayara area south of Mosul had taken place with representatives from Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.&quot; In July 2014, al-Douri issued an audio recording praising &quot;the heroes and knights of al Qaeda and the Islamic State&quot; forces in attacking Iraqi government positions within Saladin, Kirkuk, Diyala, and Nineveh Governorates. His connections with Islamist elements in Iraq is said to have emerged as far back as during Saddam&#x27;s regime. According to the &quot;Soufan Group&quot;, al-Douri had close ties with senior ISIL officials Abu Muslim al-Turkmani and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi. Both men had served in the Ba&#x27;athist regime under Saddam Hussein, with al-Turkmani being a Lieutenant colonel and serving in the &quot;Istikhbarat&quot; and Special Republican Guard. Al-Iraqi had been a Colonel in Iraq&#x27;s Air Defense Intelligence.

Al-Douri has been pointed out as one of the main commanders responsible for successful takeover by resistance groups of North Iraq and the city of Mosul in June 2014. The Naqshbandi Army, along with other groups led by former Ba&#x27;ath officers, are reported to have assumed an increasingly large role in the governance and administration of occupied cities. Militants were reported to have appointed fellow Ba&#x27;ath generals Azhar al-Obeidi and Ahmed Abdul Rashid as the governors of Mosul and Tikrit. Shortly afterwards, unverified reports emerged that the Ba&#x27;ath Party, under al-Douri&#x27;s leadership, declared war on ISIL in response to the displacement of Christians from Mosul. Other reports still maintained that there was a limited degree of cooperation between the two groups.

===Iraqi Civil War and resurfacing===
In May 2015, an audio recording alleging to be that of al-Douri, criticized both IS and Iran. He also hailed the Saudi-led alliance targeting the Houthi militias in Yemen. On IS he stated &quot;We do cross paths ... but what stops us from meeting is that even if we wanted to, they would not accept because they consider the Ba&#x27;ath infidels&quot;. He claimed that the group was detaining a third of the Ba&#x27;ath&#x27;s command, and then went on to claim the number of IS victims in Iraq &quot;does not equal 1% of those killed by the militias&quot;. On Iran, al-Douri called for the &quot;Iraqis in Al-Anbar and Karbala to strongly fight the Persian criminal plan, which aims at swallowing Iraq.&quot; He stressed that Iran is the main player in Iraq and it is working through the Quds Force.

In October 2015, it was reported that al-Douri&#x27;s Naqshbandi Army was involved in secret discussions with the Iraqi government, alongside other insurgent groups, as part of a move to create a new Sunni force to fight IS in Iraq.

On 7 April 2016, he released a video in which he sits at a desk in military uniform, flanked by two bodyguards and reads a statement. He calls on &#x27;mujahideen&#x27; in Iraq to fight the Shia militias and combat Iranian influence in Iraq under the Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism created by Saudi Arabia on 15 December 2015. He said: &quot;We consider everything that is happening in Iraq from Iran, its agents, militias, and its security apparatus, is the responsibility of the United States&quot;. He added: &quot;If it [U.S.] did not move to save Iraq and its people from Iran&#x27;s hegemony, control and occupation, and to stop bloodshed, destruction, burning and the changing demographic, then Iraqi people should resist [the occupation].&quot; He stated that one of the ways to deal with the issue in Yemen was to make Iran and its allies adhere to the Security Council decision on ceasefire.

On 7 April 2018, al-Douri released a new video commemorating the 71st anniversary of the Baath party and vowing that U.S. President Donald Trump &quot;will never attack Iran until the Resurrection Day.&quot;

In an article published by NRT News, an Iraqi politician, Hassan Alawi, claimed to have had information about previous meetings of Al-Douri in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, claiming “he never left the homeland”.

===Allegations of death===
In November 2005, Arab media reported that al-Douri died of natural causes, probably in Iraq. On 17 April 2015, al-Douri allegedly died during a military operation conducted by the Iraqi Army near Al-Alaas oil fields in Hamrin Mountains, east of Tikrit. Iraqi security forces and Shia militias opened fire at a convoy believed to be carrying al-Douri and nine bodyguards, resulting in a 25-minute firefight. General Haider al-Basri, a senior Iraqi commander, announced to state television that the man believed to be al-Douri and his guards were killed. The Shi&#x27;ite militant organization Asa&#x27;ib Ahl al-Haq claimed to have killed him, saying that his body was being transported to Baghdad to confirm its identity. Before delivering the body to Baghdad, Shi&#x27;ite militias did DNA tests on the body and confirmed the results on 19 April. The body was delivered to Baghdad on 20 April, with the government starting the DNA tests a day after, on 21 April. The governor of Salahaddin province, Raed al-Jabbouri, characterized al-Douri as a &quot;mastermind of Islamic State in Iraq&quot; and stated that his death would be a blow to the group.

On 24 April 2015, the Iraqi Health Ministry spokesman, Dr. Ziyad Tareq, said: &quot;The ministry does not have any DNA test (results) for any relative of al-Douri at the present time, and further efforts will be made to achieve a DNA result.&quot;

On 15 May 2015, a Ba&#x27;athist television channel released an audio recording, purportedly made by al-Douri, in which the speaker referred to events that had happened since al-Douri&#x27;s reported death on 17 April.

On 21 June 2018, Raghad Saddam Hussein was reported to have sent a note of condolence to Al Douri&#x27;s family, with the source saying that &quot;Douri died of a hematological illness at a Tunisian hospital.&quot;

== Death ==
Several Arabic language media outlets reported that the Baath Party announced his death on 26 October 2020. It is unknown what he died of. Al-Baath Party issued a statement following his death, which read: &quot;Today, the knight of the Baath and the Iraqi national resistance has dismounted from his horse&quot;. Saddam&#x27;s daughter, Raghad, tweeted a message regarding Al-Douri&#x27;s death on 26 October.

<text>Bernd Heinrich Wilhelm von Kleist (; 18 October 177721 November 1811) was a German poet, dramatist, novelist, short story writer and journalist. His best known works are the theatre plays &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot;, &quot;Das Käthchen von Heilbronn&quot;, &quot;The Broken Jug&quot;, &quot;Amphitryon&quot; and &quot;Penthesilea&quot;, and the novellas &quot;Michael Kohlhaas&quot; and &quot;The Marquise of O.&quot; Kleist died by suicide together with a close female friend who was terminally ill.

The Kleist Prize, a prestigious prize for German literature, is named after him, as was the Kleist Theater in his birthplace Frankfurt an der Oder.

== Life ==
Kleist was born into the von Kleist family in Frankfurt an der Oder in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, a province of the Kingdom of Prussia. After a scanty education, he entered the Prussian Army in 1792, served in the Rhine campaign of 1796, and retired from the service in 1799 with the rank of lieutenant. He studied law and philosophy at the Viadrina University, and in 1800, a subordinate post in the Ministry of Finance at Berlin.

In the following year, Kleist&#x27;s roving restless spirit got the better of him, and procuring a lengthened leave of absence, he visited Paris, then settled in Switzerland. There, he found congenial friends in Heinrich Zschokke and (1777–1819), son of the poet Christoph Martin Wieland; and to them, he read his first drama, a gloomy tragedy, &quot;&quot; (1803).

In the autumn of 1802, Kleist returned to Germany; he visited Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland in Weimar, stayed for a while in Leipzig and Dresden, returned to Paris. Returning in 1804 to his post in Berlin, he transferred to the Domänenkammer (department for the administration of crown lands) at Königsberg. On a journey to Dresden in 1807, Kleist was arrested by the French as a spy; he remained a close prisoner of France in the Fort de Joux. On regaining his liberty, he proceeded to Dresden, where, in conjunction with Adam Heinrich Müller (1779–1829), he published the journal &quot;Phöbus&quot; in 1808.

In 1809 Kleist went to Prague, and ultimately settled in Berlin. He edited (1810/1811) the &quot;&quot;. Captivated by the intellectual and musical accomplishments of the terminally-ill Henriette Vogel(de). Kleist, more disheartened and embittered than ever, agreed to do her bidding and die with her, carrying out this resolution by first shooting Vogel then himself on the shore of the Kleiner Wannsee (Little Wannsee) near Potsdam, on 21 November 1811.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, &quot;Kleist&#x27;s whole life was filled by a restless striving after ideal and illusory happiness, and this is reflected in his work. He was by far the most important North German dramatist of the Romantic movement, and no other of the Romanticists approaches him in the energy with which he expresses patriotic indignation.&quot;

=== A life with a plan ===
In the spring of 1799, the 21-year-old Kleist wrote a letter to his half-sister in which he found it &quot;incomprehensible how a human being can live without a life plan&quot; (&quot;Lebensplan&quot;). In effect, Kleist sought and discovered an overwhelming sense of security by looking to the future with a definitive plan for his life. It brought him happiness and assured him of confidence, especially knowing life without a plan only saw despair and discomfort. The irony of his suicide is the fodder of his critics.

===Relationship with Henriette Vogel and suicide pact===
Kleist met Henriette Vogel in 1809 through his friend Adam Müller; a friendship flourished. They shared a fondness for music, and according to Ernest Peguilhen, Henriette Vogel asked her friend to explain to her the art of war, as well as to teach her fencing, for the dramatist was a soldier. The relationship between the two became intimate in the autumn of 1811. According to their contemporaries, there was no fire of passion but a purely spiritual love. His cousin Marie von Kleist, the most important sponsor and confidant of Heinrich von Kleist, also made sure these rumors spread. According to the autopsy report, Vogel was suffering from cancer.

On 21 November 1811 the two traveled from Berlin to Wannsee. Prior to their departure, they penned farewell letters, which along with an account of the final night they spent at the inn Gasthof Stimming, are part of world literature. Upon their arrival in the vicinity of the Wannsee in Potsdam, Kleist shot Henriette, then turned the gun on himself. They were buried together in a common grave at Kleine Wannsee (Bismarckstrasse), which became a tourist attraction. It was re-designed prior to the bi-centenary of their deaths. On that occasion, direct access from Wannsee station to the grave was built. The gravestone, erected by Germans in 1936, was rotated, and shows engraved original text written by Max Ring and the Pater Noster&#x27;s request: &quot;forgive us our guilt&quot; as well as the names and data of Henriette Vogel and Heinrich von Kleist.
== Literary works ==
His first tragedy was &quot;The Schroffenstein Family&quot; (&quot;Die Familie Schroffenstein&quot;). The material for the second, &quot;Penthesilea&quot; (1808), queen of the Amazons, is taken from a Greek source and presents a picture of wild passion. More successful than either of these was his romantic play, &quot;Käthchen of Heilbronn&quot; (&quot;Das Käthchen von Heilbronn&quot;) (1808), a poetic drama full of medieval bustle and mystery, which retained its popularity for many years.

In comedy, Kleist made a name with &quot;The Broken Jug&quot; (&quot;Der zerbrochne Krug&quot;) (1808), while &quot;&quot; (1808), an adaptation of Molière&#x27;s comedy, received critical acclaim long after his death. Of Kleist&#x27;s other dramas, &quot;Die Hermannsschlacht&quot; (1809) is a dramatic work of anti-Napoleonic propaganda, written as Austria and France went to war. It has been described by Carl Schmitt as the &quot;greatest work of all time&quot;. In it he gives vent to his hatred of his country&#x27;s oppressors. This, together with the drama &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot; (&quot;Prinz Friedrich von Homburg oder die Schlacht bei Fehrbellin&quot;), which is among his best works, was first published by Ludwig Tieck in Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Hinterlassene Schriften&quot; (1821). &quot;Robert Guiskard&quot;, a drama conceived on a grand plan, was left a fragment.

Kleist was also a master in the art of narrative, and of his &quot;Gesammelte Erzählungen&quot; (&quot;Collected Short Stories&quot;) (1810–1811), &quot;Michael Kohlhaas&quot;, in which the famous Brandenburg horse dealer in Martin Luther&#x27;s day is immortalized, is one of the best German stories of its time. &quot;The Earthquake in Chile&quot; (&quot;Das Erdbeben in Chili&quot;) and &quot;St. Cecilia, or the Power of Music&quot; (&quot;Die heilige Cäcilie oder die Gewalt der Musik&quot;) are also fine examples of Kleist&#x27;s story telling as is &quot;The Marquise of O&quot; (&quot;Die Marquise von O&quot;). His short narratives influenced those of Kafka and the novellas of the Austrian writer Friedrich Halm. He also wrote patriotic lyrics in the context of the Napoleonic Wars.

===Work in rhetoric===
Kleist&#x27;s work also delved into the realm of rhetoric. Most notable for his use of error and understanding its importance, Kleist&#x27;s devices used were misspeaking, misunderstanding, mistaken identities, and other confusions of the sort. In his works one can see the most prevalent use of rhetoric within &quot;Penthesilea&quot;. In the story moments of violence, seduction and war all hinge upon errors in language. Through these errors, Kleist shows how error can influence everyday situations and can be the causation of serious problems. As a sum, Kleist&#x27;s use of error explores what one can make of ironic errors within speech.

== Philosophical essays ==
Kleist is also famous for his essays on subjects of aesthetics and psychology which, to the closer look, show a keen insight into the metaphysical questions discussed by philosophers of his time, such as Kant, Fichte and Schelling.

=== &quot;On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking&quot; ===
In the first of his larger essays, &quot;On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking&quot; (&quot;&quot;), Kleist claims that most people are advised to speak only about what they already understand. Instead of talking about what you already know, Kleist admonishes his readers to speak to others with &quot;the sensible intention of instructing yourself.&quot; Fostering a dialogue through the art of &quot;skillful questioning&quot; can play a role in achieving a rational or enlightened state of mind, but need not (&quot;Nor is it that her skillful questioning leads me on to the point which matters, though this may frequently be the case&quot; (von Kleist, p. 405)). And yet, Kleist employs the example of the French Revolution as the climactic event of the Enlightenment era whereby man broke free from his dark and feudal chains in favor of liberty, equality, fraternity. It is not that easy though for Kleist. Man cannot simply guide himself into the future with a rational mind as his primary tool. Therefore, Kleist strongly advocates for the usefulness of reflection &quot;&quot; or after the fact. In doing so, man will be able to mold his collective consciousness in a manner conducive to the principles of free will. By reflecting after the fact, man will avoid the seemingly detestable inhibitions offered in rational thought. In other words, the will to power has &quot;its splendid source in the feelings,&quot; and thus, man must overcome his &quot;struggle with &quot; with a balanced mixture of wisdom and passion.

<text>David Merrick (born David Lee Margulois; November 27, 1911 – April 25, 2000) was an American theatrical producer who won a number of Tony Awards.

==Life and career==
Born David Lee Margulois to Jewish parents in St. Louis, Missouri, Merrick graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, then studied law at the Jesuit-run Saint Louis University School of Law. In 1940, he left his legal career to become a successful theatrical producer.

His first seven productions were hits, starting with &quot;Clutterbuck&quot; in 1949, which he produced in partnership with Irving Jacobs, and he set a precedent in 1958 of having four productions on Broadway simultaneously; all hits: &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Jamaica&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. He often was his own competition for the Tony Award, and he frequently won multiple nominations and/or wins in the same season.

Merrick was known for his love of publicity stunts. In 1949, his comedy &quot;Clutterbuck&quot; was running out of steam, but along with discount tickets, he paged hotel bars and restaurants around Manhattan during cocktail hour for a &quot;fictive Mr. Clutterbuck&quot; as a way of generating name recognition for his production, and it helped his show keep alive for another few months. Another famous stunt promoted the poorly reviewed 1961 musical &quot;Subways Are For Sleeping&quot;. Merrick found seven New Yorkers who had the same names as the city&#x27;s seven leading theater critics: Howard Taubman, Walter Kerr, John Chapman, John McClain, Richard Watts Jr., Norman Nadel, and Robert Coleman. Merrick invited the seven namesakes to the musical and secured their permission to use their names and pictures in an advertisement alongside quotes such as &quot;One of the few great musical comedies of the last thirty years&quot; and &quot;A fabulous musical. I love it.&quot; Merrick then prepared a newspaper ad featuring the namesakes&#x27; rave reviews under the heading &quot;7 Out of 7 Are Ecstatically Unanimous About Subways Are For Sleeping&quot;. Only one newspaper, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, published the ad, and only in one edition; however, the publicity that the ad garnered helped the musical remain open for 205 performances (almost six months). Merrick later revealed that he had conceived the ad several years previously, but had not been able to execute it until Brooks Atkinson retired as &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic in 1960 since he could not find anyone with the same name.

Merrick joined The Lambs in 1950, and in 1968 he joined the board of directors of the Riviera, a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, alongside Harvey Silbert and Harry A. Goodman. He also worked with director and choreographer Gower Champion, who directed Merrick&#x27;s production of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. But on the morning of August 25, 1980, Champion died of a rare blood cancer, and Merrick announced the news himself to both the cast and the audience at the opening night curtain call.

Merrick suffered a stroke in 1983, after which he spent most of his time in a wheelchair. He established the David Merrick Arts Foundation in 1998 to support the development of American musicals.

== Personal life ==
Merrick was married six times to five women.

His first marriage was to fellow native-St. Louisan Leonore Beck. They married January 16, 1938, and divorced on January 11, 1963.

His second wife, Jeanne Gibson, was a Kentucky-born Broadway press agent.  They met at the Savoy Hotel in London, where Gibson was working as the hotel’s press consultant. She became pregnant in 1962, while Merrick was still married to Beck. Their daughter, Cecilia Ann Merrick, was born January 1963. Gibson and Merrick were married from spring 1963 until October 1966.

He married Etan Aronson (February 24, 1944 - July 26, 2023), a Swedish model and former flight attendant, twice. They first married in September 1969, and divorced in Mexico three weeks later, but the divorce was not finalized in America until 1976. Together, they had a daughter, Marguerita Merrick (born September 1972).

On July 1, 1982, Merrick married actor Karen Prunczik, who originated the role of Anytime Annie and filled in for a week playing the lead character Peggy Sawyer in Merrick’s &quot;42nd Street&quot;. They divorced in 1983.

Merrick and Aronson married for the second time on Tuesday, August 30, 1983 in Greenwich, Connecticut. In the late 1980s, they adopted two children, Olivia Merrick (born May 1988) and Carl Christian Merrick (born July 1987), although in 1994 Merrick petitioned the court to cancel the adoption. Merrick and Aronson divorced again in October 1999, after lengthy divorce proceedings.

Merrick met Natalie Lloyd (born Natalie Ting Teresa in Shanghai in 1954) in the late 1980s when she was working as a receptionist in the office of William Goodstein, Merrick’s lawyer. They started living together almost immediately, while Merrick was still married to Aronson. Merrick and Lloyd married November 1999, less than six months before Merrick’s death on April 25, 2000.

== Honors ==
In 1965, Merrick received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2001, Merrick was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

== Biography ==
An unauthorized biography by Howard Kissel is titled &quot;David Merrick: The Abominable Showman&quot; ().

==Cultural references==
In &quot;What Does A Naked Lady Say to You?&quot;, a first-season episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, the director of the nude off-Broadway play &quot;Bathtub&quot; (itself based on &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;) complains after police officer Murray Greschler (Al Molinaro) busts the production for indecency, &quot;Murray, you wouldn&#x27;t do this to me if I was David Merrick!&quot;

In &quot;We Closed in Minneapolis&quot;, a first-season episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, Mary&#x27;s character comments to the mailroom guy upon seeing his delivery to Murray&#x27;s desk of what she assumes to be a rejection letter, &quot;Oh, poor Murray. He&#x27;s been writing this play for three years. You&#x27;d think Broadway producers would be sensitive enough to do more than just stick mimeographed rejection slips in when they send it back. You know, something like a nice, handwritten note saying, &quot;Good work, Murray. Nice try. Love, David Merrick.&quot;

<text>Mohammed Hamza az-Zubeidi (1938 – December 2, 2005) () was an Iraqi military officer and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Iraq from 1991 to 1993. He is on the &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Dirty Dozen&quot; list of people responsible for torture and murder in Iraq, playing a key role in Iraq&#x27;s brutal suppression of the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. He was featured in Iraqi news film kicking and beating captured rebels.

==Career==
Az-Zubeidi was a Ba&#x27;athist whose loyalty lay with his ethnicity (Arab) rather than his personal faith. He played a key part in the suppression of the multi-ethnic Shiite uprising in March 1991. He became the country&#x27;s Prime minister in September that year and remained in this position for two years, until he was replaced by Ahmad Husayn Khudayir as-Samarrai in September 1993.

He was a member of the Revolutionary Command Council and the commander of the Central Euphrates military district, but had not been in power for two years.

He was the Queen of Spades in the deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards issued by the US government during the war in Iraq. After the fall of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, he was captured on April 20, 2003, near the small city of Mahaweel. 

He remained in American custody until his death of natural causes in a military hospital on December 2, 2005. On that day, an American spokesman revealed that someone had died in a military hospital but did not reveal his name. Two days later, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti announced Zubeidi&#x27;s death at his trial, complaining that they were both suffering from cancer and that he did not want to end up dead like Zubeidi because of what he claimed was poor medical treatment.

<text>Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti (; 27 February 1947 – 8 July 2013), half-brother of Saddam Hussein, was the leader of the Iraqi secret service, the &quot;Mukhabarat&quot;, at the time of the 1991 Gulf War. He was the head of the Directorate of General Security from 1991 to 1996, and later served as a presidential advisor to Hussein.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition, Sabawi went into hiding. On 27 February 2005, his arrest was made public. Sabawi was the &quot;six of Diamonds&quot; in the US deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards, and number 36 of the top 55 most-wanted Iraqis list. He was suspected of being behind explosions and killings that took place after the collapse of the former Iraqi regime, and a one-million dollar reward was offered for information leading to his capture or death. Syria had captured Sawabi and turned him over to Iraqi forces, who in turn handed him over to U.S. forces. Syria was repeatedly accused of protecting former Iraqi officials, a charge the Syrian government consistently denied.

In March 2009, Sabawi was sentenced to death by hanging by a court in Baghdad. As his death sentence was read out, he stood up and proclaimed &quot;God is great&quot; and that he was proud to be a martyr. On 8 July 2013, Sabawi died of cancer.

His son, Ayman, also arrested by the U.S., was serving a life sentence when he escaped from prison on 9 December 2006. One of Ibrahim&#x27;s brothers, Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti, was also sentenced to death, while his other brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, was executed in 2007.

<text>Watban Ibrahim al-Nasiri (‎; 1952 – 13 August 2015) was an Iraqi politician and former Interior Minister of Iraq. He was the half-brother of Saddam Hussein and the brother of Barzan al-Tikriti. He was taken into coalition custody on April 13, 2003, following his capture as he tried fleeing to Syria. He died in prison of natural causes in 2015.

As Saddam&#x27;s half-brother, Watban was a close advisor of his, belonging to Saddam&#x27;s inner circle while also holding several high-profile security apparatus roles. In those roles, he allegedly took part in the genocidal Al-Anfal Campaign against the Kurds in Northern Iraq. He became Interior Minister in 1991, and in that role was accused of having overseen the detention, torture, and executions of hundreds of prisoners. Some of those executions were reportedly taped, with copies kept at the ministry. As Interior Minister, Watban was also involved in suppressing the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, specifically in the Baghdad suburbs of Thawra, Shu&#x27;la, Hurriya&#x27; Bayya&#x27;, the village of Yousiffiya and the nearby districts of Mahmoudiyah. Government suppression of the uprising in these districts often involved mass executions.

Watban was a member of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party. Despite his high-profile roles, he was believed to not have been fully trusted by Saddam. In 1995, he was shot nine times in the leg by Uday Hussein, Saddam&#x27;s oldest son, reportedly during an argument over Watban&#x27;s growing popularity among Iraqis. He reportedly lost his leg, genitals, and part of his stomach as a result. After the incident, Saddam ordered Watban to a position of relative obscurity in Tikrit.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition, Watban was the five of spades in the U.S. military&#x27;s most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. He was taken into coalition custody on April 13, 2003, following his capture as he tried fleeing to Syria.

On 11 March 2009, Watban was sentenced to death by hanging for his role in the execution of 42 merchants accused of manipulating food prices.

On the morning of 14 July 2011, the U.S. handed Watban over to Iraqi authorities, expecting that he would be executed within a month. Instead, he remained imprisoned until his death from natural causes on 13 August 2015.

In 2017, Uday’s son Massoud claimed, without sharing any evidence, that his body had been stolen by the Iranian government. The claim was never proven.

<text>Barzan Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti (; 17 February 1951 – 15 January 2007), also known as Barazan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Barasan Ibrahem Alhassen and Barzan Hassan, was one of three half-brothers of Saddam Hussein, and a leader of the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi intelligence service. As the head of the Mukhabarat, he was responsible for ordering the killings of dissidents. Despite falling out of favour with Saddam at one time, he was believed to have been a close presidential adviser at the time of his capture by U.S. forces in 2003. On 15 January 2007, Barzan was hanged for crimes against humanity. He was decapitated by the hangman&#x27;s rope after errors were made calculating his body weight and length of drop from the platform.

==Early and personal life==
Barzan İbrahim al-Tikriti was born in 1951 (or 1950) in Tikrit. In 1968, he accompanied his half brother Saddam during the 17 July Revolution.

==Head of the Mukhabarat==
Barzan was a leading figure in the Mukhabarat, the intelligence service that performed the role of secret police from the 1970s, and later took over as director. During his time in the secret police, Barzan played a key role in the Iraqi regime&#x27;s execution of opponents at home and assassinations abroad. He was also known for his ruthlessness and brutality in purging the Iraqi military of anyone seen as disloyal.

Barzan became Iraq&#x27;s representative to the United Nations in Geneva—including the UN Human Rights Committee—in 1989. He was in Geneva for almost a decade, during which he is believed to have managed clandestine accounts for Saddam&#x27;s overseas fortune. Swiss intelligence services alleged that Barzan controlled the al Tikriti family&#x27;s vast wealth through the canton of Ticino headquartered firm &quot;Mediterranean Enterprises Development Projects&quot; (MEDP). Swiss attorney Alain Bionda represented Barzan&#x27;s interests in Switzerland. In the 1990s, Swiss National Bank estimated Barzan&#x27;s fortune at 462million Swiss francs. Barzan&#x27;s son, Muhammad, who was the Geneva representative of the Iraqi national airline Iraqi Airways, is the direct heir of the al Tikriti clan. 

U.S. officials characterized Barzan as a member of what they called &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Dirty Dozen&quot;, responsible for torture and mass murder in Iraq. Barzan was the five of clubs (queen of hearts according to CNN) in the U.S military&#x27;s most-wanted Iraqi playing cards.

==Human rights violations==
Barzan was said to have been noted for his cruelty. According to Indict, a US-backed organisation based in London which advocated for Iraqi war crimes tribunal, he was personally responsible for murdering and torturing scores of innocent people, including the inhabitants of one entire village, while he was head of the secret service. He was said to have used methods such as whipping with electrical cords and would often oversee torture. During the trial one woman testified that after her arrest she was stripped naked and tied up by her feet before the intelligence chief kicked her in the chest repeatedly. Ahmed Hassan, another prosecution witness, described being taken to an interrogation facility in Baghdad and seeing a meat grinder for human flesh. He allegedly shot an agent of his for buying a bottle of duty-free wine without asking permission.

==Post-invasion==
Barzan was among the leadership figures U.S. forces targeted during the Iraq War. In April 2003, warplanes dropped six satellite-guided bombs on a building in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, where he was thought to be. U.S. Army Special Forces captured Barzan alive on 17 April 2003; the news was publicly confirmed late summer 2003, with Barzan surrounded by a large entourage of bodyguards in Baghdad. He was turned over to Iraq&#x27;s Interim Government on 30 June 2004, and arraigned on 1 July 2004.

==Trial and courtroom charges==

Barzan&#x27;s trial started on 19 October 2005. He was a defendant in the Iraq Special Tribunal&#x27;s Al-Dujail trial, and Abd al-Semd al-Husseini was his defense counsel. In the first stage of the trial, Barzan stood before a five-judge panel for the Dujail Massacre. He was charged for crimes against humanity, simultaneously with seven other former high officials (Taha Yassin Ramadan, Saddam Hussein, Awad Hamed al-Bandar, Abdullah Kadhem Roweed Al-Musheikhi, Ali Daeem Ali, Mohammed Azawi Ali and Mizher Abdullah Roweed Al-Musheikhi). They were said to have ordered and overseen the killings, in July 1982, of more than 140 Shiite men from Dujail, a village 35 miles north of Baghdad. The men were allegedly killed in retribution after an 8 July 1982 attack on the presidential motorcade as it passed through the village. It was alleged that, in addition to the killings, hundreds of women and children from the town were jailed for years in desert internment camps, and that date palm groves, which sustained the local economy and were the families&#x27; livelihood, were destroyed.

During the first court session on 19 October 2005, Barzan pleaded not guilty. During his trial, he became known for his angry outbursts in court and was ejected on several occasions.

In the weeks following the first audience, serious security concerns for the defense team of Saddam and the other accused became apparent. On 21 October 2005, 36 hours after the first hearing, a group of unidentified armed men dragged one of the defense attorneys from his office in east Baghdad and shot him dead. A few days later, a second lawyer was killed in a drive-by shooting, and a third, injured in that attack, subsequently fled Iraq for sanctuary in Qatar.

As a result, calls for the trial to be held abroad were heard. The defense lawyers, supported by the Iraqi Bar Association, imposed a boycott on the trial until their security concerns were met with specific measures. A few days before the trial was to resume, the defense team announced that it had accepted offers of protection from Iraqi and U.S. officials and would appear in court on 28 November 2005. The agreement is said to have included the same level of protection offered to the Iraqi judges and prosecutors, with measures such as armored cars and teams of bodyguards.

After a short court session on 28 November 2005, during which some testimony regarding the killings in Dujail was presented, Judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin ordered a one-week adjournment until 5 December, to grant the defense teams time to find new counsel.

On 12 March 2006, the prosecutor announced that if Saddam Hussein and his seven co-defendants were sentenced to death in the Dujail case, the sentence would be carried out as soon as possible. Thus, the other cases for which they were indicted would not be heard in court. On 19 June 2006, the prosecutor asked the court, in his closing arguments, that the death penalty be imposed upon Barzan, Saddam, and Ramadan.

On 5 November 2006, Barzan was sentenced to death by hanging.

===Appeals===
A sentence of death or life imprisonment generates an automatic appeal. On 3 December 2006, the defense team lodged an appeal against the verdicts for Barzan, Saddam, and al-Bander, who had been sentenced to death. On 26 December 2006, the appeals chamber confirmed the verdict and the death sentence against Barzan.

In November 2006, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani appealed for Barzan to be moved to medical facilities to receive treatment for his spinal cancer. Barzan originally made an appeal from his cell to U.S. President George W. Bush and to Talabani for treatment, referring to the latter as an &quot;old friend&quot;.

==Botched execution==
On 15 January 2007, the death sentence was carried out. Barzan, along with co-defendants Saddam Hussein and the former Chief Justice of the Iraqi Revolutionary Court al-Bandar, were sentenced to death by hanging. Barzan was originally scheduled to hang on 30 December with Saddam (as he and al-Bandar wished) but due to the Eid, lack of time, and lack of a helicopter to deliver them, as well as international pressure, the hangings were postponed to 15 January. Barzan&#x27;s sentence was carried out at 03:00 local time (00:00 UTC) on 15 January 2007. His death was confirmed at 3:05/00:05 UTC. Barzan was decapitated by the long drop, the accidental result of the hangman using a rope that was too long. As with Saddam&#x27;s hanging, Barzan&#x27;s and al-Bandar&#x27;s counsel was not allowed to attend.

===Reaction to the execution===
On 15 January, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a news conference with the Egyptian foreign minister: &quot;We were disappointed there was not greater dignity given to the accused under these circumstances.&quot;

In a press briefing by British Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s official spokesman, in response to a question as to Blair&#x27;s reaction to the &quot;botched hanging&quot; in Iraq, the spokesman said: &quot;In terms of the death penalty in Iraq, our position on the death penalty is well known, and we had made that position known to the Iraqi Government again since the death of Saddam Hussein. However, Iraq is a sovereign Government, and therefore has a right under international law to decide its own policy on the death penalty.&quot;

Barzan&#x27;s son-in-law, Azzam Saleh Abdullah, said: &quot;We heard the news from the media. We were supposed to have the information a day earlier, but it seems that the government does not know the rules.&quot; He said the execution reflected the hatred felt by the Shiite-led government: &quot;They still want more Iraqi bloodshed. To hell with democracy.&quot;

<text>Hikmat Mizban Ibrahim al-Azzawi (1933 – January 27, 2012) was an Iraqi politician who was a Deputy Prime Minister and twice Minister of Finance under the government of Saddam Hussein.

Azzawi originally trained as an economist. He was arrested in 1960 protesting against the government of Iraqi General Abd al-Karim Qasim. He joined the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1968 and was named undersecretary of state for Commerce. He was fired from all his official designations in 1982 and demised to low administrative job and expelled from the party, until the 1985 when he became Governor of the Central Bank of Iraq, in April, 1987 he was humiliated in a public meeting and severely dismissed for refusing to transfer a large sum of money at the demand of one of the Saddam&#x27;s uncles.

President Saddam Hussein forced him back into the position of Minister of Finance in 1995.

In July 1999, he was given the honorary title of Deputy Prime Minister. After the United States-led Invasion of Iraq in 2003, he was listed as number 45 (8 of Diamonds) on the Iraqi most-wanted playing cards. He was peacefully detained from his house in Baghdad on April 19, 2003 by Iraqi police and handed over to the US military.

He died, aged 79, in prison due to lack of his heart medications. A government spokesman said his health had been deteriorating because of aging, although another cited cancer as the cause of death.

<text>Ewald Christian von Kleist (7 March 171524 August 1759) was a German poet and cavalry officer. His vast family was well-established in Farther Pomerania; 58 male members of his family fought in Frederick the Great&#x27;s army of the Seven Years&#x27; War. 
Kleist was born at Zeblin, near Köslin (Koszalin) in Farther Pomerania, to the von Kleist family of cavalry leaders. 

==Family==

The Kleist family is an old, established one in Farther Pomerania whose roots date to the 12th century. Kleist&#x27;s father, Joachim Ewald (1684–1738), son of Ewald von Kleist (died 1694), had been born on the family estate. On 7 July 1710, he married Marie Juliane von Manteuffel (sister of Heinrich von Manteuffel) from Groß-Poplow (near Polzin, in the district of Belgard). She died on 9 November 1719 after the birth of the sixth child.

Ewald Christian, the third child of this marriage, lived with his only brother, Franz Casimir, one year older, at the estate of a paternal uncle, Christian von Manteuffel, in Groß-Poplow. Both boys attended the Jesuit school in Deutsch Krone (now Wałcz, Poland) and subsequently, in 1729, the Danzig Gymnasium; in 1731 Ewald von Kleist advanced to the University of Königsberg, where he studied law and mathematics. Either on the completion of his studies, or because his father was unhappy with the direction his studies took (he insisted on studying theology and modern languages and classics as well as law and mathematics) he entered the Danish army, in which he became an officer in 1736. He served in a unit commanded by a friend of his father.

In 1738 he was sent to Gdańsk to visit his father and sister, as well as to his good friend Battrow (north-east of Flatow), a distant relative, the widowed chief of Goltz, whose daughter Wilhelmine made an impression on him; he became betrothed to her, but they were separated by his military service and she married another man.

==Military service==
Recalled to Prussia by King Frederick II in 1740, he was appointed lieutenant in a newly formed regiment stationed at Potsdam, where he became acquainted with J. W. L. Gleim, who interested him in poetry. After distinguishing himself at the Battle of Mollwitz (10 April 1741) and the siege of Neisse (1741), he was promoted to captain in 1749 and major in 1756.

Quartered during the winter of 1757–1758 in Leipzig during the Seven Years&#x27; War, he found relief from his irksome military duties in the society of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. His regiment, the Schenckendorff Grenadiers, entered into summer campaigns. Shortly afterwards in the Battle of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he was mortally wounded in the forefront of the attack. Thomas Carlyle offers a description of his death, possibly apocryphal: Kleist was attached to Finck&#x27;s division at the Prussian right. He&#x27;d been hit several times by ricochets, and possibly musket balls, perhaps even 12 times. He continued to lead his troops forward, taking a third battery, when he was badly hurt on both arms. His &quot;colonel&quot; (Major Mark K. A. von Schwartz) fell; he led his regiment forward to the fourth battery when a case-shot smashed his leg into pieces; once he fell, Captain Sylvius von Swolinsky took command of the battalion. He fell from his horse, and was carried to the rear. In due course, a surgeon was brought to him, but was killed by case-shot. One of his friends tried to send a carriage to him, to move him out of danger, but it took so long he was cut off by the Russian advance. By evening, the Cossacks stripped him bare, and threw him into the nearest swamp. Later that night some Russian Hussars found Kleist in this situation, took him to a dry place, set a watch fire and gave him some bread. When they had left, the Cossacks returned and took the blanket the Russians had given him. Eventually a Russian cavalry troop passed by; one of their captains, had him sent to Frankfurt in a carriage. Under the care of a professor there, he had surgery and good nursing, although on the tenth night, the bone fell apart, cut an artery, and at 2 a.m. on the 24th he died. He received a soldier&#x27;s funeral, his coffin borne by 12 Russian grenadiers, and attended by some officers; one staff officer laid his own sword on the bier.

==Poetry==
Kleist&#x27;s chief work is a poem in hexameters, &quot;Der Frühling&quot; (1749), for which Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Seasons&quot; largely supplied ideas. It earned him the nickname &quot;the Poet of the Spring.&quot; He noted in his letters that Carl Wilhelm Ramler had given him belated commentary and improvements on his poem, which he self-published in December 1749. Subsequently, his poem received considerable notice, even from Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis.

Kleist also wrote some odes, idylls and elegies, and a small epic poem, &quot;Cissides und Paches&quot; (1759), the subject being two Thessalian friends who die an heroic death for their country in a battle against the Athenians. Likewise, he composed epitaphs for his many friends who were killed in battle, such as Major Heinrich von Blumenthal, which eerily foretold his own:

Kleist published in 1756 the first collection of his &quot;Gedichte&quot;, which was followed by a second in 1758. After his death his friend Karl Wilhelm Ramler published an edition of Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot; in 2 vols (1760). A critical edition was published by August Sauer, in 3 vols (1880–1882). See also Arthur Chuquet, &quot;De Ewaldi Kleistii vita et scriptis&quot; (Paris, 1887), and Heinrich Pröhle, &quot;Friedrich der Grosse und die deutsche Literatur&quot; (1872).

Research places the three Kleist poets—Ewald, Franz Alexander von Kleist and Heinrich von Kleist to the same forefather at the start of the 15th century.
