<text>The Roots are an American hip hop band formed in 1987 by singer Tariq &quot;Black Thought&quot; Trotter and drummer Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Roots serve as the house band on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, having served in the same role on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; from 2009 to 2014. Current regular members of The Roots on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; are Captain Kirk Douglas (guitar), Mark Kelley (bass), James Poyser (keyboards), Ian Hendrickson-Smith (saxophone), Damon &quot;Tuba Gooding Jr.&quot; Bryson (sousaphone), Stro Elliot (keyboards and drums), Dave Guy (trumpet), Kamal Gray (keyboards), and Raymond Angry (keyboards).

The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip hop featuring live musical instruments and the group&#x27;s work has consistently been met with critical acclaim. ThoughtCo ranked the band #7 on its list of the 25 Best Hip-Hop Groups of All-Time, calling them &quot;Hip-hop&#x27;s first legitimate band.&quot; 

In addition to the band&#x27;s music, several members of the Roots are involved in side projects, including record production, acting, and regularly serving as guests on other musicians&#x27; albums and live shows.

==Band history==

===1987–1993: early years===

The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson and Tariq &quot;Black Thought&quot; Trotter while they were both attending the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. They would busk out on the street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Black Thought rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. Another MC, Malik B., and a permanent bass player, Leonard &quot;Hub&quot; Hubbard, were added to the band before the release of their first album. In 1992, they dropped the &quot;Square&quot; from &quot;Square Roots&quot; because a local folk group had claim to the name.

Unable to break through in their native Philadelphia, the band briefly moved to London, where they would release their 1993 debut, &quot;Organix&quot;. The album was released and sold independently. In the span of a year, the band developed a cult following in Europe, boosted by touring. The Roots would receive offers from music labels, and the band eventually signed with DGC/Geffen.

===1994–1997: &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot; and &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;===
The Roots&#x27; first album for DGC, &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;, was released in the United States the year following the signing. During the recording process, beatboxer Rahzel and keyboardist Scott Storch joined the band. The addition of the two members provided additional depth to the band&#x27;s sound, and energized the Roots&#x27; Philadelphia jam sessions, which the band would later sample for songs on &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;. The album&#x27;s opening track features Black Thought introducing the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;organic hip hop jazz&quot;; the album is characterized by a combination of contemporary East Coast hip hop and jazz influences, with a heavy reliance on Storch&#x27;s Fender Rhodes and the occasional saxophone of guest musician Steve Coleman. The album spawned three singles with accompanying videos: &quot;Proceed&quot;, &quot;Distortion to Static&quot;, and &quot;Silent Treatment&quot;. The album was a moderate hit among alternative music fans, boosted by the group&#x27;s appearance at Lollapalooza. In 1995, the band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In the years since its release, &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot; has come to be considered to be a classic jazz rap album.

The 1996 release &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot; was the group&#x27;s third album and their first to break the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, spurred in part by MTV&#x27;s airplay of the video for &quot;What They Do&quot; (a parody of rap video clichés) and &quot;Clones&quot;, which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. The band added &quot;What They Do&quot; was also the group&#x27;s first single to hit the Top 40 of Billboard&#x27;s charts, reaching a peak of No. 34. Scott Storch left the band and was replaced by a new keyboardist, Kamal Gray. The band&#x27;s sound would take a darker turn during this period, heavily influenced by the Wu-Tang Clan and the RZA&#x27;s grimy and haunting production style, replete with samples from old jazz and classical music. The album is also notable for its many guests and collaborators, including Common, D&#x27;Angelo, Q-Tip, and others. These collaborations would provide the foundation for the creation of the Soulquarians and forged the Roots&#x27; association with the neo-soul subgenre.

===1998–2000: breakthrough with &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;===
The group released &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; in 1999 (named after &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, a novel by Chinua Achebe, which in turn was named after a line from &quot;The Second Coming&quot; by W.B. Yeats). This was their breakthrough album, peaking at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts and earning a gold record, signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units. The album was eventually certified platinum in April 2013. Mos Def contributed to the track entitled &quot;Double Trouble&quot;. The track &quot;Act Two&quot; features African-Belgian band Zap Mama and Common. The track &quot;You Got Me&quot;, a duet with R&amp;B singer Erykah Badu and Eve and Jill Scott intended by Black Thought for the &quot;unconscious&quot; population, peaked at No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. At the 42nd Grammy Awards &quot;You Got Me&quot; won the award for Best Rap Performance By a Duo or Group and the album was nominated for Best Rap Album.

Steve Huey of the website allmusic.com perceived &quot;a strong affinity for the neo-soul movement&quot; in the album. First-time cameos on &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; for Philadelphia natives Beanie Sigel and Eve helped to earn them major record deals later (with Roc-A-Fella and Ruff Ryders, respectively). After this album, Dice Raw left the collective to record his solo debut album &quot;Reclaiming the Dead&quot;. In the summer, the band performed at the Woodstock &#x27;99 concert in New York state.

===2001–2005: &quot;Phrenology&quot; and &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;===
Several members, including longtime member Malik B., left the group. In December 2001, the Roots backed Jay-Z for his &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert. With heightened popularity came mounting pressure. The Roots released &quot;Phrenology&quot; (named after the pseudoscience of the same name) in 2002. Despite not charting as high as &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, reaching a peak of No. 28 on the charts, &quot;Phrenology&quot; was commercially successful, being certified gold, and earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. At the time, however, there came rumors that the Roots were losing interest in their signing with MCA. During this time, the band backed Jay-Z for his 2003 farewell concert in Madison Square Garden and appeared in the accompanying &quot;Fade to Black&quot; concert film.

After &quot;Phrenology&quot;, Ben Kenney and Scratch both left the group; Kenney joined the rock band Incubus. This culminated with the release of 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, the byproduct of several jam sessions. The album earned two more Grammy nominations: one for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track &quot;Star/Pointro&quot; and another for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Nuthin&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. In 2005, &quot;Home Grown! The Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Understanding the Roots, Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;, a two-disc compilation album, was released. The Roots were among several performers on the 2006 film &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;, whose event took place on September 18, 2004, and was released on film two years later.

===2006–2008: &quot;Game Theory&quot; and &quot;Rising Down&quot;===
&quot;Game Theory&quot; was released August 29, 2006, on Def Jam Recordings. Questlove describes the album as being very dark and reflective of the political state in America. The first single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Feel Right&quot;, appeared on the internet in May 2006, and is available for free download on several websites. The album&#x27;s first video, titled &quot;The Don&#x27;t Feel Right Trilogy&quot;, premiered on August 21, 2006, and features three songs, &quot;In the Music&quot;, &quot;Here I Come&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Feel Right&quot;. It earned an 83 on Metacritic and two Grammy Nominations. The late J Dilla is honoured on different occasions throughout the album. Track 1 is credited to be &quot;Supervised by J Dilla&quot;. Track 13 &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop This&quot; is devoted to his persona, the first part being an edited version of a track (&quot;Time: The Donut of the Heart&quot;) of his &quot;Donuts&quot; album, released three days before his death. This version comprises vocals by Black Thought. Secondly, a string of kindred artists reminisce about J Dilla in the form of answering machine messages.

The Roots&#x27; eighth studio album, &quot;Rising Down&quot;, was released on April 29, 2008, the 16-year anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In the weeks before the album&#x27;s release, the original first single &quot;Birthday Girl&quot;, a radio-friendly collaboration with Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Patrick Stump was removed from the album reportedly because it did not fit in with the album&#x27;s tone. It remained as a digital download available from iTunes as a bonus track, as well as on international releases. Picking up where &quot;Game Theory&quot; left off, the album maintains a dark and political tone, with Black Thought and several guests venting about the ills of society. The album&#x27;s guests include Chrisette Michele, Common, Mos Def, Saigon, Styles P, Talib Kweli, and Wale; it also features Philadelphia artists Dice Raw, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Peedi Crakk, Greg Porn, and Truck North, as well as former member Malik B. &quot;Rising Down&quot; features the Roots incorporating a more electronic and synth-heavy feel into their sound. &quot;Rising Down&quot; was released to critical acclaim, garnering an overall score of 80 on Metacritic. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Rising Up&quot; featuring Chrisette Michele and Wale.

The Roots was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire. Responding to an earlier &quot;Times&quot; report, Questlove confirmed that the masters for &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot; and &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot; were among those lost in the fire.

===2009–2010: &quot;How I Got Over&quot; and &quot;Wake Up!&quot;===
&quot;How I Got Over&quot; reflects the relief the band felt at the end of the Bush administration and the beginning of the Obama presidency. Guests include Blu, Phonte, and Patty Crash. A cover of Cody Chesnutt&#x27;s song &quot;Serve This Royalty&quot; was expected to be covered on the album, similar to the group&#x27;s reworking of his single for &quot;The Seed 2.0&quot; on &quot;Phrenology&quot;. Rather than relying on samples, the album was recorded live, with covers (including &quot;Celestial Blues&quot;, featuring the song&#x27;s original artist, Andy Bey) being reinterpreted by the band. The album was released on June 22, 2010.

On June 24, 2009, the Roots debuted the first single and title track from the album live on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The song features longtime Roots collaborator Dice Raw. The Roots collaborated with R&amp;B singer John Legend on the album &quot;Wake Up!&quot;. The album was released on September 21, 2010, and was publicized two days later with a live concert at Terminal 5 in New York City with John Legend and Jennifer Hudson that was streamed on YouTube. On October 30, 2010, the Roots and John Legend played live at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, D.C.

===2011–2014: &quot;Undun&quot;, &quot;...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin&quot; and side projects===
The Roots released their 13th album &quot;Undun&quot; via Def Jam Records on December 6, 2011. The first single &quot;Make My&quot; leaked on October 17, 2011. &quot;Undun&quot; tells the story of their semifictional character, Redford Stephens, who struggles unsuccessfully to avoid a life of crime and fast money. The album&#x27;s name is inspired by The Guess Who&#x27;s song &quot;Undun&quot;, and the character was named after the Sufjan Stevens song &quot;Redford&quot;. The album features artists including Aaron Livingston, Big K.R.I.T., Phonte, Dice Raw, Greg Porn, Truck North, Bilal, and Sufjan Stevens. The Roots also collaborated with R&amp;B singer Betty Wright on the 2011 album &quot;Betty Wright: The Movie&quot;, credited to Betty Wright and the Roots. The album, co-produced by Wright and Questlove, was nominated for a 2012 Grammy in the &quot;Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance.&quot;

The Roots and Elvis Costello released &quot;Wise Up Ghost&quot; on September 17, 2013, via Blue Note Records. On July 22, 2013, they released a music video for the first single, &quot;Walk Us Uptown&quot;. The Roots released &quot;...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin&quot; on May 19, 2014. The first single, &quot;When the People Cheer&quot;, was released on April 7, 2014. Black Thought described the album as a satirical look at violence in hip-hop and American society overall.

===2015–present: &quot;End Game&quot;===
In an interview with Fuse TV, Questlove said he also had &quot;two or three secret, major musical projects that I&#x27;m working on that I can&#x27;t really talk about.&quot; In September 2016 The Roots backed up Usher at a Global Citizen benefit concert in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, launching speculation of a major collaboration between the two acts. In October 2016, the group announced their 17th studio album, &quot;End Game&quot;. Black Thought in June 2017 further revealed that producers 9th Wonder and Salaam Remi will contribute to the album, and in March 2019, Questlove revealed there will be an unreleased J Dilla beat on it as well.

==Members==
The Roots&#x27; original lineup included Tariq &quot;Black Thought&quot; Trotter (MC) and Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson (drums), classmates at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh &quot;The Rubberband&quot; Abrams, who went on to form the jazz group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, Malik Abdul Basit-Smart (&quot;Malik B.&quot;) and Leonard Nelson &quot;Hub&quot; Hubbard (bass), and Scott Storch (keyboards). Kenyatta &quot;Kid Crumbs&quot; Warren (MC) was in the band for &quot;Organix&quot;, the Roots&#x27; first album release. Another MC, Dice Raw, joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch&#x27;s position with Kamal Gray (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on &quot;Late Night With Jimmy Fallon&quot; between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC&#x27;s &#x27;Late Night&#x27; 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. 
Beatboxer Rahzel was a band member from 1995 to 2001. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist Scratch, who also DJ&#x27;d in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. 
Malik B. left the group in 1999 for personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist Ben Kenney had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the &quot;Phrenology&quot; album, but left to join Incubus as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist &quot;Captain&quot; Kirk Douglas replaced Kenney. Vocalist Martin Luther toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the &quot;Tipping Point&quot; album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band&#x27;s bassist in 2007–2011. Sousaphone player Damon &quot;Tuba Gooding Jr.&quot; Bryson joined the band in 2007.

The band announced on August 25, 2011 that Owen Biddle had left, replaced by Mark Kelley. On &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, James Poyser plays keyboards. Raymond Angry also regularly sits in on keyboards.

Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the Philadelphia Phillies during the 2009 World Series against the New York Yankees, displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, Questlove stated &quot;No comment!&quot; on the show&#x27;s intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the Philadelphia Flyers during their run to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought, and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties.

In June 2017, Questlove announced in an interview that producer and performer Stro Elliot is an official member of the Roots.

On July 29, 2020, founding member Malik B. died at the age of 47.

====Timeline====
==Touring and other work==

The band tours extensively, and their live sets are frequently hailed as the best in the genre. The Black Eyed Peas opened for The Roots in a performance at Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2001. In 2006, the band played a concert in NYC&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall with Common, Nas, Talib Kweli, and Big Daddy Kane. Also in 2006, they backed Jay-Z for his Reasonable Doubt Concert, a celebration of the 10-year anniversary of the release of his first album.

In 1994, the Roots appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. They have been highly involved in many other Red Hot Organization productions, including the 1998 album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot; and the 2001 album &quot;Red Hot + Indigo&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington.

The Roots have been featured in four movies: &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;, both performing album songs and playing as a backing band for other artists; Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bamboozled&quot;; Marc Levin&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn Babylon&quot;, in which Black Thought plays the protagonist, Solomon, and former band member Rahzel narrates; and &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;, starring Mandy Moore. Black Thought and Questlove were both featured in the movie &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Black Thought made an appearance in the film &quot;Love Rome&quot; as Tariq Trotter, and Questlove currently appears in the recent documentary movie about TBC Brass Band called &quot;From the Mouthpiece on Back&quot;, which lists the Roots as one of the executive producers of the movie.

The Roots were featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.

The band guest-performed with the Dave Matthews Band during their 2007 summer tour. Members of the Roots played in various forms as well as a whole band on DMB&#x27;s back to back concerts at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. In 2007, the band performed at an NAACP tribute to Bono, covering U2&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love).&quot; Black Thought mixed in lines from the band&#x27;s own &quot;False Media.&quot;

The group hosts a highly anticipated jam session every year the night before the Grammys. The Roots jam session, produced by Okayplayer, Goodtime Girl Entertainment, and Keldof, has been attended by celebrities ranging from Jay-Z, Beyoncé, and Tom Cruise to Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven, and Prince, with impromptu performances from Snoop Dogg and Corrine Bailey Rae to Queen Latifah, Matisyahu, Fall Out Boy, and Dave Chappelle.

Billed as &quot;The Roots,&quot; Questlove, Douglas, and Biddle made an appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on April 15, 2008, when Stephen Colbert spent a week in Philadelphia prior to the 2008 Pennsylvania Democratic primary. During the appearance, they performed the intro song to the show, and closed the episode with a rendition of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner.&quot;

The Roots are featured on the &quot;Men in Black Original Soundtrack&quot; (1997) with the song &quot;The Notic&quot; with neo-soul singer D&#x27;Angelo. The song &quot;Here I Come&quot; was featured in the films &quot;Superbad&quot;, &quot;Hancock,&quot; and &quot;Step Up 3D&quot;. &quot;Here I Come&quot; is also featured in many video games including &quot;Project Gotham Racing 4&quot;. The song &quot;The Seed 2.0&quot; featuring Cody ChesnuTT was featured in the movies &quot;Collateral&quot; and &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot;, as well as the &quot;Without a Trace&quot; episode &quot;Candy.&quot; The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Nuthin&quot; was featured in the first-season episode, &quot;Busey and the Beach,&quot; of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;. The song &quot;Guns Are Drawn,&quot; featuring Aaron Livingston, was featured in a season six episode of CBS&#x27; &quot;Cold Case&quot;. The band also collaborated with musician BT on the song &quot;Tao of the Machine,&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;Blade II&quot; along with the Japanese bonus disc for the album &quot;Emotional Technology&quot;.

In 2008, the band (then consisting of Black Thought, Questlove, Douglas, Bryson, Knuckles, Gray, and Biddle) appeared on the popular kids&#x27; show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, performing &quot;Lovely, Love My Family&quot;. Three years later, in 2011, the band returned to the show to perform &quot;We Have Fun,&quot; with Poyser joining Gray on keyboards, and Kelley (replacing Biddle) playing upright bass.

The band also did a secret jam session at the Oulipo Ballroom in Kentucky in 2009. In 2012, they played during the NHL Winter Classic at Citizen&#x27;s Bank Park in Philadelphia and at Austin City Limits Music Festival (ACL) in Austin, Texas. In 2013, they performed at the Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

The Roots host the Roots Picnic, an annual all-day music festival in Philadelphia, every June. In 2017, they headlined the 2017 NBA All Star game pregame introductions and performed a musical show with various guests titled &quot;The Evolution of Greatness.&quot;

==&quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;==
In March 2009, the Roots became the official house band on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, with &quot;Here I Come&quot; as the show&#x27;s theme. When Jimmy Fallon became the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in February 2014, the Roots became the house band for that show.

The Roots are featured heavily throughout the show, providing the bumper music in and out of commercials, as well as the opening song &quot;Here I Come&quot; and playing the show off the air. Fallon frequently interacts with the band during the course of the show, and they occasionally provide snippets of music for some monologue running jokes such as Funkin&#x27; GoNuts. They also provide music and drum rolls for the games with show guests, along with theme songs for the games and segments like Darts of Insanity, Wheel of Carpet Samples, and Christmas Sweaters.

On November 22, 2011, US Congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann was a guest on &quot;Late Night&quot;. For her entrance, the Roots controversially played a snippet from Fishbone&#x27;s 1985 song, &quot;Lying Ass Bitch&quot; resulting in apologies from Fallon, Questlove for The Roots, and NBC. The incident nearly resulted in the Roots being dismissed from the show, but the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday and a national security gaffe by Bachmann shortly after helped defuse the situation in the media. NBC now approves all walk-on songs prior to the filming of each show.

=== Sketches ===

* One of the first sketches involving the Roots was &quot;Freestyling with the Roots.&quot; Fallon finds an audience member and gets them to talk about themselves and a topic. The information is relayed to Trotter along with a genre of music, and they then compose a song on the spot. In the early days of the show in 2009, there was apprehension about their overall fit with the show, but after the first appearance of this sketch and its successful reception, &quot;...They knew they were there for life.&quot;
* Thank You Notes, a segment every Friday, involves keyboardist James Poyser prominently. The segment starts with &quot;Can I get some thank you writing music, James?&quot; with Poyser playing and typically acting upset. Fallon then tries to engage with him to get him to smile before continuing the segment.
* Slow Jam the News features Fallon and Trotter, often with a celebrity guest, rhyming over a &quot;slow-jam&quot; played by the Roots. The lyrics are often political or current events related, with guests usually appearing to talk about an issue pertinent to them. Brian Williams is a frequent popular guest &quot;vocalist,&quot; talking about the news as if he were still behind his anchor desk. Some of the notable guest slow-jammers include former President Barack Obama and former Governor Mitt Romney. Like the majority of the show, the segments are uploaded to YouTube after airing on NBC and often go viral; President Obama&#x27;s clip has received over 8 million views and the Mitt Romney clip received 2.7 million views in less than a week.
* The Roots have contributed to additional online successes with the Classroom Instruments sketch. Fallon and a musical guest from the show will record an arrangement of a song with the Roots providing accompaniment on instruments that would be found in an elementary school music class. Examples of these instruments are wood blocks, pixiphones, kazoos, tambourines, melodica, shakers, and recorders. They have performed &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot; with Carly Rae Jepsen, &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; with Robin Thicke, &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; with Mariah Carey, &quot;Hello&quot; with Adele, &quot;Runaway&quot; with Janet Jackson, the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; theme song with several members of the cast, and &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; with Metallica.
* The Roots also provide the backing tracks for Fallon&#x27;s and Justin Timberlake&#x27;s episodic &quot;History of Rap.&quot; As of March 2014, the History of Rap saga consists of 5 parts and 101 individual songs, all performed with a comedic approach. The fifth installment was performed during the inaugural week of Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;.

The founding members of The Roots attended a creative arts school in South Philadelphia called CAPA, and through a donation helped set up the CAPA Foundation, where they now sit on the board. The Roots partnership with the CAPA Foundation also includes opportunities for students to perform on national stages, learn through internships the business side of show business and a master class series.

After watching the 2010 documentary &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot;, Questlove was inspired to raise money for Harlem Village Academies, a group of charter schools.

* First Hip-Hop group to perform at Lincoln Center, January 2002
* Named one of the &quot;Twenty Greatest Live Acts in the World&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, 2003
* &quot;Heroes Award&quot; from the Philadelphia chapter of the Recording Academy, 2004 (Recipient)

==Discography==

Studio albums
* &quot;Organix&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Phrenology&quot; (2002)
* &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Game Theory&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Rising Down&quot; (2008)
* &quot;How I Got Over&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Undun&quot; (2011)
* &quot;...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin&quot; (2014)

A distinctive feature of the Roots albums is the way tracks are numbered. With the exception of their collaboration albums, the Roots have used continuous track numbering beginning with their first studio album &quot;Organix&quot; through all following albums:
* 1–17: &quot;Organix&quot;
* 18–33: &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;
* 34–53: &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;
* 54–71: &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;
* 72–76: &quot;The Legendary&quot;
* 77–86: &quot;The Roots Come Alive&quot;
* 87–102: &quot;Phrenology&quot;
* 103–113: &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;
* 114–127: &quot;Game Theory&quot;
* 128–143: &quot;Rising Down&quot;
* 143–156: &quot;How I Got Over&quot;
* 157–170: &quot;Undun&quot;
* 171–181: &quot;...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin&quot;

Questlove references this numbering system in his book &quot;Mo&#x27; Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove&quot; (specifically to the release of &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;), and explains it was &quot;...our way of saying that it was a continuation of the work we had started on &quot;Organix&quot; and &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;.&quot;

Similarly, the Roots&#x27; 2005 compilation albums, &quot;Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Vol. 2&quot;, feature a continuous track numbering beginning at negative 29 and counting up to zero. The implication is that this &quot;Beginners Guide&quot; would introduce new fans to the Roots and lead them to consuming the Roots&#x27; discography beginning at &quot;Organix&quot;.
* −29 thru −14: &quot;Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 1&quot;
* −13 thru 0: &quot;Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 2&quot;

<text>The Rayleigh law describes the behavior of ferromagnetic materials at low fields.

Ferromagnetic materials consist of magnetic domains. When a small external field formula_1 is applied, domains parallel to the external field start to grow. In this region, domain walls are moving. They are hindered by material defects. Lord Rayleigh investigated this first and quantified the magnetization formula_2 as a linear and quadratic term in the field:

:formula_3

Here formula_4 is the initial susceptibility, describing the reversible part of magnetisation reversal. The Rayleigh constant formula_5 describes the irreversible Barkhausen jumps.

The Rayleigh law was derived theoretically by Louis Néel.,

The same law describes polarization and direct and converse piezoelectric response of some ferroelectric and ferroelectric-ferroelastic materials. The common feature for ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials (i.e., ferroic materials) are domains whose boundaries (domain walls) can be moved by magnetic, electric or mechanical fields.

<doc id="212128" wikidata="Q3027728" url="?curid=212128" title="Digable Planets">
<text>Digable Planets () is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987. The trio is composed of rappers Ishmael &quot;Butterfly&quot; Butler, Mariana &quot;Ladybug Mecca&quot; Vieira, and Craig &quot;Doodlebug&quot; Irving. The group is notable for their contributions to the subgenres of jazz rap and alternative hip hop.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Butler and Irving met in Philadelphia in the late 1980s. Originally from Seattle, Butler was interning at Sleeping Bag Records in New York and would visit his grandmother in Philadelphia, where he met local native Irving, who was rapping with a group called the Dread Poets Society. Irving had in turn met Vieira, who was originally from Silver Spring, Maryland, while attending Howard University in Washington, D.C.
The initial demos recorded under the name Digable Planets featured only Butler, but after a brief stint with two other members, Butler began collaborating with Irving and Vieira in 1989.

=== 1992–1993: &quot;Reachin&#x27; (A New Refutation of Time and Space)&quot; ===
The group signed to Pendulum Records in 1992 and all three band members moved to Brooklyn, New York. Their debut album &quot;Reachin&#x27; (A New Refutation of Time and Space)&quot; was released in 1993 and certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)&quot; became a crossover hit, peaking at #15 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s singles chart, earning gold certification by the RIAA, and winning Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the Grammy Awards. The track peaked at #67 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1995.

=== 1994–1995 &quot;Blowout Comb&quot; and breakup ===
The group&#x27;s second album &quot;Blowout Comb&quot; was released in 1994. The album was noted by critics as a stark departure from the previous album, being darker, less hook-oriented and more overtly political in its references to Black Panther and communist imagery. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot; in December 1994, Craig Marks declared it &quot;... a beguiling, demanding, damn near revolutionary follow-up.&quot; &quot;Blowout Comb&quot; features guest appearances from artists Jeru the Damaja, Sulaiman, and Guru of Gang Starr.

In the same year, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The band subsequently disbanded in early 1995 citing &quot;creative differences&quot;.

=== 2005–present: Reunions and live album===
In February 2005 the trio reunited and embarked on a reunion tour, which was followed by the release of a compilation album titled &quot;Beyond the Spectrum: The Creamy Spy Chronicles &quot;on October 15, 2005. The album combined previously released material with remixes and B-sides. From 2009 to 2011, Butler and Irving toured across the U.S., Canada, and Europe with a live band, the Cosmic Funk Orchestra.

The group performed at Numbers, in Houston, Texas, on May 15, 2010, alongside the hip hop duo Camp Lo. During an interview with the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; near the time of this show, Irving stated that a new single would be released, called &quot;Fresh Out&quot;, and that a new album was planned for digital release in summer of 2010. The group also performed alongside hip-hop group The Pharcyde at the North by Northeast music festival in Toronto, Ontario on June 19, 2011.

A reunion show scheduled for December 2012 in Seattle, Washington was cancelled days before the performance. When asked in a subsequent interview about the group&#x27;s status, Butler stated &quot;I think it&#x27;s the end.&quot; Despite Butler&#x27;s previous statement, it was announced in October 2015 that the trio would again reunite for a concert at Seattle&#x27;s Neptune Theatre on December 30 alongside Shabazz Palaces. Digable Planets held a reunion tour during spring and summer 2016, followed by the release of their live album &quot;Digable Planets Live&quot; in June 2017. &quot;Digable Planets Live&quot; was recorded live on July 28–29, 2016, at Ardmore Music Hall in Ardmore, Pennsylvania — just 3 miles outside Philadelphia, which is where the members first met and initially formed and based their trio.

==Solo work and collaborations==

Butler released &quot;Bright Black&quot; under the moniker Cherrywine in 2003 before going on to collaborate with multi-instrumentalist Tendai &quot;Baba&quot; Maraire as the group Shabazz Palaces, which has released five albums. Butler has also been employed by Sub Pop&#x27;s A&amp;R division and is helping the label build its repertoire of artists that are &quot;imaginative&quot; and &quot;daring&quot;. Butler and Maraire later collaborated with Hussein Kalonji as Chimurenga Renaissance to release &quot;riZe vadZimu riZe &quot;in March 2014 on Brick Lane Records.

Irving, also known as Cee Knowledge, released two albums under the name Cee Knowledge &amp; The Cosmic Funk Orchestra. Vieira, also known as Lady Mecca, released &quot;Trip The Light Fantastic&quot; in 2005. She has continued to collaborate regularly with other musicians, notably on Legacy/Sony&#x27;s Billie Holiday &quot;Remixed and Reimagined&quot; album, Del tha Funkee Homosapien&#x27;s &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, and with hip-hop supergroup eMC. Vieira joined hip hop group Dino 5 as the voice of Tracy Triceratops. Vieira later joined Brazilian hip hop fusion group BROOKZILL! with fellow Dino 5 member Prince Paul.

<doc id="212131" wikidata="Q234600" url="?curid=212131" title="Al Ain">
<text>Al Ain () is a city in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and the seat of the administrative division of the Al Ain Region. The city is bordered to the east by the Omani town of Al-Buraimi. Al Ain is the largest inland city in the Emirates, the fourth-largest city (after Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah), and the second-largest in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The freeways connecting Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai form a geographic triangle in the country, each city being roughly from the others.

==Climate and geography==
Al Ain is known as the &quot;Garden City&quot; () of Abu Dhabi, the UAE or the Gulf, due to its greenery, particularly with regard to the city&#x27;s oases, parks, tree-lined avenues and decorative roundabouts, with strict height controls on new buildings, to no more than seven floors. According to one author, an oasis around Al Ain and Al-Hasa in Saudi Arabia are the most important in the region of the Gulf.

The city is located approximately east of the capital Abu Dhabi, and about south of Dubai. The eastern region covers an area of approximately . Oman lies to the east, Dubai and Sharjah to the north, Abu Dhabi to the west and the Empty Quarter desert and Saudi Arabia to the south. The topography of Al Ain is unique and varies as one travels to the east. The ecologically important &quot;Jebel Hafeet&quot; (&quot;Mount Hafeet&quot;), an outlier of the main Hajar range, is considered one of the monuments of Al Ain, lying just to the south of the city. Rising to in elevation, Jebel Hafeet is one of the highest mountains in the country, and has a number of ridges which stretch to the inner part of the city, two of which are &quot;Jabal Al Naqfah&quot; (which touches Al Ain Oasis), and the Western ridge. Sand dunes of varying texture that are tinged red with iron oxide lie to the north and east of Al Ain.

The city has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), featuring long, extremely hot summers and warm winters. In Al-Ain, the mean annual rainfall is and the average relative humidity is 60% (United Arab Emirates University, 1993). Low humidity in Al-Ain, particularly during the summers, makes it a popular destination for many people during this time of the year. Boer (1997) classified the UAE climate as hyper-arid and divided it into four climatic regions: the coastal zone along the Persian Gulf, the mountain areas northeast of UAE, the gravel plains around Al Ain, and the central and southern sand desert. More rainfall and lower temperature occur in the northeast than in the southern and western regions. The monthly average rainfall around Al-Ain was from the period 1970 to 1992.

To the south of the city, near Oman, there is the man-made Lake Zakher, which resulted from the release of waste water from desalination plants. Also in this region, to the east of Jebel Hafeet, lies the area of Mezyad, which has a border crossing with Oman, and is where the historic Mezyad Fort is located.

==Demographics==
With a population of 846,787 (as of 2021), it has the highest percentage of Emirati nationals (30.8%) in the country, though the majority of its residents are expatriates, particularly from the Indian subcontinent. Many people are from Bangladesh and Pakistan. There is also a significant number of Afghans in the city.

==Economy==

Al Ain is an important services centre for a wide area extending into Oman. There are three major shopping centres, Al Ain Mall, Al Jimi Mall, Al Hili Mall and Al Bawadi Mall (opened in 2009 in Al Khrair area) as well as traditional souqs for fruit and vegetables and livestock. One such souq exists for camels near an IKEA store and Bawadi Mall on Zayed Bin Sultan Street, the road which leads to Mezyad. Industry is growing on a small scale, and includes the Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Al Ain Portland Cement Works. The water in Al-Ain is of good quality. Service industries such as car sales, mechanics and other artisans are located in the area known as Sanaiya and Pattan Market.

Al Ain also has world&#x27;s largest dates processing and marketing company, Al Foah Company LLC. The place is also famous for Al Ain Dairy Farm located just outside Al Ain.

==History and prehistory==


The region of Al Ain and Buraimi, together known as the Buraimi Oasis, is of cultural and historical importance. For example, the area witnessed events relevant to the history of Islam during the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid eras, similar to Dibba and Ras Al-Khaimah. It was at this place Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of the United Arab Emirates,had spent considerable time of his life (approximately from 1927 till he became the Ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1966). Though it is often said that he was born in Abu Dhabi, some others were of the opinion that he was born in Al-Ain. Al-Ain could also be the place for the oldest mosque in the country, which is in the premises of the Sheikh Khalifa Mosque.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emirates24/7 10-2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the historically important Western Hajar region, the area of Al Ain has been inhabited for nearly 8,000 years, with archaeological sites showing human settlement at places like Rumailah, Hili and Jabel Ḥafeet. The early Hafit culture built &quot;beehive&quot; tombs for their dead and engaged in hunting and gathering in the area. The oases provided water for early farms until the modern age. In the 1950s, Sheikh Zayed discovered the tombs, and brought this to the attention of a Danish team, leading to an excavation at the tombs in 1959. In 1971, Al Ain Museum was built to house items from this area. In the 2000s, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture &amp; Heritage lobbied for its recognition as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and in 2011, Al Ain became the first World Heritage Site in the UAE to be recognized by UNESCO.

Bronze Age burial sites often re-used materials from earlier burials. For instance, the Wadi Suq communal tomb at Qattara Oasis is thought to have been constructed from stones recovered from previous Umm Al Nar burials.

Finds at Qattara include Wadi Suq era chlorite jugs and bowls and late Bronze Age short swords and daggers. Artefacts recovered also include carnelian jewellery, often associated by UAE historians with trading links to the Indus Valley. A find of particular interest from Qattara is a Bronze Age pendant discovered in the 1970s depicting a double-bodied or entwined pair of horned animals. Made from electrum, an alloy of silver and gold, the motif is found repeated in a number of Bronze Age sites in the UAE. Iron Age finds in and around Al Ain include &quot;aflaj&quot; (underground water channels) in Bidaa bint Saud, Al Ain and Buraimi which have been placed several centuries prior to the qanats of the Achaemenid Empire, which had previously been credited with the innovation.

Al Ain was originally within the area of influence of the Dhawahir, a Bedouin tribe who settled Dhahirah before Buraimi. A later wave of settlers, the Na&#x27;im, have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute. Numbering 4,500, the Dhawahir consists of three subsections: the Daramikah, who populated Hili, Mutared and Qattara; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the Trucial States.

A number of interests jostled for influence over the tribes of Buraimi, including the Sultan of Muscat, the Wahhabis (who had made a number of incursions) and the Sheikhs of the Trucial States, particularly the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi, who acquired large tracts of land, principally from the Dhawahir. This suzerainty over Al Ain was cemented by Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, known as &#x27;Zayed the Great&#x27;, a strong and charismatic leader who took the Dhawahir&#x27;s main settlement &#x27;Ain Dhawahir (the original name of Al Ain) when the tribe rebelled against him in 1877. He built a fort, one of a number of fortifications established by the various interests vying for control over the oasis, to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a &quot;wali&quot;, appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman.

Wilfred Thesiger visited Al Ain in the late 1940s, during his travels across the Empty Quarter. He met Sheikh Zayed and stayed with him at Al Muwaiji Fort. An ongoing dispute between Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Oman led to the Buraimi Dispute, a series of incidents which saw a Saudi armed force enter the oasis. Forces from the Trucial Oman Scouts, as well as the army of Muscat-Oman, arrived to recapture the oasis. With British intervention, the Saudi forces surrendered, leaving the oasis back in the hands of Abu Dhabi and Oman.

In 1971, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Hilton Hotel in the area, during her tour of the Persian Gulf. Following independence in 1971, Al Ain experienced rapid growth and investment as part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, quickly becoming larger and more successful than Oman&#x27;s Al-Buraimi. In 1972, Oman and Abu Dhabi agreed on the final borders to divide Buraimi and Al Ain. Until Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s death in 2004, Al Ain&#x27;s municipal code forbade construction of buildings over four stories, with the exceptions of the Hilton (now Radisson Blu), Danat Al Ain Resort, and Rotana hotels. Until 2006, Buraimi and Al Ain shared an open border. This border was closed in November 2006, and passport controls were imposed.

===Oases and &quot;Aflaj&quot;===
The city&#x27;s &quot;wāḥāt&quot; () are known for their underground irrigation system (&quot;falaj&quot; or &quot;qanāt&quot;) that brings water from boreholes to water farms and palm trees. Falaj irrigation is an ancient system dating back thousands of years, and is used widely in Oman, the UAE, China, Iran and other countries. There are seven oases here. The largest is Al Ain Oasis, near Old Sarooj, and the smallest is Al-Jahili Oasis. The rest are Al Qattara, Al-Muʿtaredh, Al-Jimi, Al-Muwaiji, and Hili.

Examples of &quot;aflaj&quot; include &quot;Falaj Hazza&quot;, which is named after Sheikh Zayed&#x27;s elder brother, Hazza bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and has a district named after it.

==Infrastructure==
The city is known for its combination of modern and pre-modern buildings. The latter offer an insight into the city&#x27;s and country&#x27;s cultural heritage. The city used to have roundabouts in every intersection but recently it has been replaced by traffic signals.

===Education===

Al-Ain is home to the main federal university in the UAE, the United Arab Emirates University, and to two campuses of the Higher Colleges of Technology – Al Ain Men&#x27;s College and Al Ain Women&#x27;s College. Al-Ain is also the home of Horizon International flight academy, Etihad Airways&#x27;s cadet pilot training centre. Private higher education institutions include the Al Ain University and campus of Abu Dhabi University. Al-Ain also houses the eastern zone headquarters of the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge, Abu Dhabi&#x27;s education authority.

Many of Al-Ain&#x27;s private schools, catering mainly to the expatriate population, are located in the Al-Manaseer area. They include Al-Ain International school (British curriculum, private school, part of the Aldar group), Al Ain English Speaking School, Al Dhafra Private School, Manor Hall School, Al-Sanawbar School, Liwa International School, Al-Madar International School, Global English School, Emirates Private School, a branch of the International School of Choueifat, and an Institute of Applied Technology campus.

A new British International School, Belvedere International School is located in the Al Hili district. In 1977, the Zayed Central Library was established. Al-Khwarizmi International College has started a Campus at Al-Ain and is offering BBA programme and various other licensed, accredited and approved courses.

===Health===

The first hospital in Al-Ain was Kanad Hospital (formerly known as Oasis Hospital), established in 1960 by the American missionary couple Drs. Pat and Marian Kennedy at the invitation of Sheikh Zayed. It is the oldest hospital in Al Ain and the second oldest in the United Arab Emirates.

Al-Ain is also the home of Tawam Hospital, a training and research hospital linked with the UAE University. It was officially inaugurated on 17 December 1979. In March 2006, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Johns Hopkins Medicine International) (JHMI) took over the management of Tawam hospital.

Tawam Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in the UAE with 503 beds, featuring 24 VIP suites, 78 isolation rooms, 48 ER beds, 9 operating theaters and 81 specialty clinics. Its oncology centre is the main national cancer treatment centre as well as a regional referral centre.

Al Ain Hospital (abbr: AAH, also known as Al-Jimi Hospital) is the general hospital delivering health services to all Al-Ain patients regardless of their nationality. It is centrally located in the Al-Jimi district and is linked with the UAE University. Al-Ain Hospital still occupies old 1970s buildings, but a new building is planned. AAH currently has about 450 beds and provides services in all medical disciplines. In September 2007, the Medical University of Vienna International (MUVI) took over the management of AAH.

===Places of worship===
Formerly, the city&#x27;s largest mosque was that of Shaikha Salamah. In 2021, the Sheikh Khalifa Grand Mosque became the biggest in the city, as well as one of the largest mosques in the country.

The southern border area of Mezyad lies on the road to Dhank, Ibri and Nizwa in Oman. The city&#x27;s airport (Al Ain International Airport) has scheduled passenger flights to Egypt, Pakistan and India. A new railway line linking Al-Ain to Abu Dhabi and to the Port of Sohar in Oman is being planned. 

==Tourism and recreation==

Al-Ain is developing as a tourist destination. The dry desert air makes it a welcome retreat from the coastal humidity of the larger cities. Many Emirati nationals in Abu Dhabi have holiday houses in the city making it a popular weekend destination for families from the capital city. Its attractions include the Al Ain National Museum, the Al Ain Palace Museum, several restored forts and the Hili Archaeological Park site, dating back to the Bronze Age. Jebel Hafeet dominates the surrounding area. It is popular to visit to the mineral springs at Green Mubazzarah at the base of the mountain, and to drive to the mountaintop at sunset.

Opened in 2012, Al Ain Adventure park is located near Jebel Hafeet and provides a range of water-based activities including surfing, kayaking and rafting. On top of Jabel Hafeet is the Mercure Hotel. Mount Hafeet and the nearby &#x27;beehive&#x27; tombs are part of what is known as &quot;Jebel Hafeet Desert Park&quot; or &quot;Mezyad Desert Park&quot;, which is meant to preserve the nature and geology of the area, besides attracting tourists.

Al-Ain has five major malls – Al Ain Mall in the town centre, Al-Jimi Mall in Al-Jimi District, Bawadi Mall in Al-Khrair District, Remal Mall located in the Sanaiya district, and Hili Mall located in the Hili District. Most commercial activity is centred in and around town centre. 

Another popular pastime for Emiratis and expatriates alike is spending time in coffee shops and shisha cafes. Like the rest of the UAE, Al-Ain has strict laws governing the consumption and distribution of alcohol. Five facilities in the city currently serve alcohol, four of which are hotels. There are many café&#x27;s in Al-Ain, ranging in size and quality. The city also has an International standard go-kart circuit.

<text>John Henry McDowell (born 7 March 1942) is a South African philosopher, formerly a fellow of University College, Oxford, and now university professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Although he has written on metaphysics, epistemology, ancient philosophy, nature, and meta-ethics, McDowell&#x27;s most influential work has been in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. McDowell was one of three recipients of the 2010 Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&#x27;s Distinguished Achievement Award, and is a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences and the British Academy.

McDowell has, throughout his career, understood philosophy to be &quot;therapeutic&quot; and thereby to &quot;leave everything as it is&quot; (Ludwig Wittgenstein, &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;), which he understands to be a form of philosophical quietism (although he does not consider himself to be a &quot;quietist&quot;). The philosophical quietist believes that philosophy cannot make any explanatory comment about how, for example, thought and talk relate to the world but can, by offering re-descriptions of philosophically problematic cases, return the confused philosopher to a state of intellectual perspicacity.

However, in defending this quietistic perspective McDowell has engaged with the work of leading contemporaries in such a way as to therapeutically dissolve what he takes to be philosophical error, while defending major positions and interpretations from major figures in philosophical history, and developing original and distinctive theses about language, mind and value. In each case, he has tried to resist the influence of what he regards as a scientistic, reductive form of philosophical naturalism that has become very commonplace in our historical moment, while nevertheless defending a form of &quot;Aristotelian naturalism,&quot; bolstered by key insights from Hegel, Wittgenstein, and others.

==Life and career==

McDowell was born in Boksburg, South Africa and completed a B.A. at the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1963, he moved to New College, Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, where he earned another B.A. in 1965 and an M.A. in 1969. He taught at University College, Oxford, from 1966 until 1986, when he joined the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is now a University Professor. He has also been a visiting professor at many universities, including Harvard University, University of Michigan, and University of California, Los Angeles.

McDowell was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1983 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. In 2010 he received the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award in the Humanities.

McDowell delivered the John Locke Lectures in Philosophy at Oxford University in 1991 (these became his book &quot;Mind and World&quot;.) He has also given the Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia University in 1997 and the Howison Lectures in Philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley in 2006.

He received an honorary degree from the University of Chicago in 2008.

==Philosophical work==

===Early work===

McDowell&#x27;s earliest published work was in ancient philosophy, most notably including a translation of and commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. In the 1970s he was active in the Davidsonian project of providing a semantic theory for natural language, co-editing (with Gareth Evans) a volume of essays entitled &quot;Truth and Meaning&quot;. McDowell edited and published Evans&#x27;s influential posthumous book &quot;The Varieties of Reference&quot; (1982).

In his early work, McDowell was very much involved both with the development of the Davidsonian semantic programme and with the internecine dispute between those who take the core of a theory that can play the role of a theory of meaning to involve the grasp of truth conditions, and those, such as Michael Dummett, who argued that linguistic understanding must, at its core, involve the grasp of assertion conditions. If, Dummett argued, the core of a theory that is going to do duty for a theory of a meaning is supposed to represent a speaker&#x27;s understanding, then that understanding must be something of which a speaker can manifest a grasp. McDowell argued, against this Dummettian view and its development by such contemporaries as Crispin Wright, both that this claim did not, as Dummett supposed, represent a Wittgensteinian requirement on a theory of meaning and that it rested on a suspect asymmetry between the evidence for the expressions of mind in the speech of others and the thoughts so expressed. This particular argument reflects McDowell&#x27;s wider commitment to the idea that, when we understand others, we do so from &quot;inside&quot; our own practices: Wright and Dummett are treated as pushing the claims of explanation too far and as continuing Willard Van Orman Quine&#x27;s project of understanding linguistic behaviour from an &quot;external&quot; perspective.

In these early exchanges and in the parallel debate over the proper understanding of Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarks on rule-following, some of McDowell&#x27;s characteristic intellectual stances were formed: to borrow a Wittgensteinian expression, the defence of a realism without empiricism, an emphasis on the human limits of our aspiration to objectivity, the idea that meaning and mind can be directly manifested in the action, particularly linguistic action, of other people, and a distinctive disjunctive theory of perceptual experience.

The latter is an account of perceptual experience, developed at the service of McDowell&#x27;s realism, in which it is denied that the argument from illusion supports an indirect or representative theory of perception as that argument presupposes that there is a &quot;highest common factor&quot; shared by veridical and illusory (or, more accurately, delusive) experiences. (There is clearly a distinction between perceiving and acquiring a belief: one can see an &quot;apparently bent&quot; stick in the water but not believe that it is bent as one knows that one&#x27;s experience is illusory. In illusions, you need not believe that things are as the illusory experiences represent them as being; in delusions, a person believes what their experience represents to them. So the argument from illusion is better described as an argument from delusion if it is to make its central point.)

In the classic argument from illusion (delusion) you are asked to compare a case where you succeed in perceiving, say, a cat on a mat, to the case where a trick of light deceives you and form the belief that the cat is on the mat, when it is not. The proponent of the argument then says that the two states of mind in these contrasting cases share something important in common, and to characterise this we need to introduce an idea like that of &quot;sense data.&quot; Acquaintance with such data is the &quot;highest common factor&quot; across the two cases. That seems to force us into a concession that our knowledge of the external world is indirect and mediated via such sense data. McDowell strongly resists this argument: he does not deny that there is something psychologically in common between the subject who really sees the cat and the one that fails to do so. But that psychological commonality has no bearing on the status of the judger&#x27;s state of mind from the point of view of assessing whether she is in a position to acquire knowledge. In favourable conditions, experience can be such as to make manifest the presence of objects to observers – that is perceptual knowledge. When we succeed in knowing something by perceiving it, experience does not fall short of the fact known. But this just shows that a successful and a failed perceptual thought have nothing interesting in common from the point of view of appraising them as knowledge.

In this claim that a veridical perception and a non-veridical perception share no highest common factor, a theme is visible which runs throughout McDowell&#x27;s work, namely, a commitment to seeing thoughts as essentially individuable only in their social and physical environment, so called externalism about the mental. McDowell defends, in addition to a general externalism about the mental, a specific thesis about the understanding of demonstrative expressions as involving so-called &quot;singular&quot; or &quot;Russellian&quot; thoughts about particular objects that reflects the influence on his views of Gareth Evans. According to this view, if the putative object picked out by the demonstrative does not exist, then such an object dependent thought cannot exist – it is, in the most literal sense, not available to be thought.

===Value theory===
In parallel with the development of this work on mind and language, McDowell also made significant contributions to moral philosophy, specifically meta-ethical debates over the nature of moral reasons and moral objectivity. McDowell developed the view that has come to be known as secondary property realism, or sensibility or moral sense theory. The theory proceeds via the device of an ideally virtuous agent: such an agent has two connected capacities. She has the right concepts and the correct grasp of concepts to think about situations in which she finds herself by coming to moral beliefs. Secondly, for such a person such moral beliefs are automatically over-riding over other reasons she may have and in a particular way: they &quot;silence&quot; other reasons, as McDowell puts it. He believes that this is the best way to capture the traditional idea that moral reasons are specially authoritative.

McDowell rejects the Humean theory that every intentional action is the result of a combination of a belief and a desire, with the belief passively supplying a representation and the desire supplying the motivation. McDowell, following Thomas Nagel, holds that the virtuous agent&#x27;s perception of the circumstances (i.e. her belief) justifies both the action and the desire. In order to understand the desire, we must understand the circumstances that the agent experienced and that compelled her to act. So, while the Humean thesis may be true about explanation, it is not true about the structure of justification— it should be replaced by Nagel&#x27;s &quot;motivated desire theory&quot;.

Implicit in this account is a theory of the metaphysical status of values: moral agents form beliefs about the moral facts, which can be straightforwardly true or false. However, the facts themselves, like facts about colour experience, combine anthropocentricity with realism. Values are not there in the world for any observer, for example, one without our human interest in morality. However, in that sense, colours are not in the world either, but one cannot deny that colours are both present in our experience and needed for good explanations in our common sense understanding of the world. The test for the reality of a property is whether it is used in judgements for which there are developed standards of rational argument and whether they are needed to explain aspects of our experience that are otherwise inexplicable. McDowell thinks that moral properties pass both of these tests. There are established standards of rational argument and moral properties fall into the general class of those properties that are both anthropocentric but real.

The connection between McDowell&#x27;s general metaphysics and this particular claim about moral properties is that all claims about objectivity are to be made from the internal perspective of our actual practices, the part of his view that he takes from the later Wittgenstein. There is no standpoint from outside our best theories of thought and language from which we can classify secondary properties as &quot;second grade&quot; or &quot;less real&quot; than the properties described, for example, by a mature science such as physics. Characterising the place of values in our worldview is not, in McDowell&#x27;s view, to downgrade them as less real than talk of quarks or the Higgs boson.

===Later work: &quot;Mind and World&quot; (1994)===
McDowell&#x27;s later work reflects the influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, P. F. Strawson, Robert Brandom, Rorty and Sellars; both &quot;Mind and World&quot; and the Woodbridge lectures focus on a broadly Kantian understanding of intentionality, of the mind&#x27;s capacity to represent. Influenced by Sellars&#x27;s famous diagnosis of the &quot;myth of the given&quot; in traditional empiricism, McDowell&#x27;s goal in &quot;Mind and World&quot; is to explain how we are passive in our perceptual experience of the world, but active in conceptualizing it. In his account, he tries to avoid any connection with idealism, and develops an account of what Kant called the &quot;spontaneity&quot; of our judgement in perceptual experience.

&quot;Mind and World&quot; rejects a reductively naturalistic account: what McDowell calls &quot;bald naturalism.&quot; He contrasts this with his own &quot;naturalistic&quot; perspective in which the distinctive capacities of mind are a cultural achievement of our &quot;second nature&quot;, an idea that he adapts from Gadamer. The book concludes with a critique of Quine&#x27;s narrow conception of empirical experience and also a critique of Donald Davidson&#x27;s views on belief as inherently veridical, in which Davidson plays the role of the pure coherentist.

In his later work, McDowell denies that there is any philosophical use for the idea of nonconceptual content— the idea that our experience contains representations that are not conceptually structured. Starting with a careful reading of Sellars&#x27; &quot;myth of the given&quot;, he argues that we need to separate the use of concepts in experience from a causal account of the pre-conditions of experience. He argues that the idea of &quot;nonconceptual content&quot; is philosophically unacceptable because it straddles the boundary between these two. This denial of nonconceptual content has provoked considerable discussion because other philosophers have claimed that scientific accounts of our mental lives (particularly in the cognitive sciences) need this idea.

While &quot;Mind and World&quot; represents an important contemporary development of a Kantian approach to philosophy of mind and metaphysics, one or two of the uncharitable interpretations of Kant&#x27;s work in that book receive important revisions in McDowell&#x27;s later Woodbridge Lectures, published in the &quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot;, Vol. 95, 1998, pp. 431–491. Those lectures are explicitly about Wilfrid Sellars, and assess whether or not Sellars lived up to his own critical principles in developing his interpretation of Kant (McDowell claims not). McDowell has, since the publication of &quot;Mind and World,&quot; largely continued to re-iterate his distinctive positions that go against the grain of much contemporary work on language, mind and value, particularly in North America where the influence of Wittgenstein has significantly waned.

===Influences===

McDowell&#x27;s work has been heavily influenced by, among others, Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx, John Cook Wilson, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Philippa Foot, Elizabeth Anscombe, P. F. Strawson, Iris Murdoch, David Wiggins, and, especially in the case of his later work, Wilfrid Sellars. Many of the central themes in McDowell&#x27;s work have also been pursued in similar ways by his Pittsburgh colleague Robert Brandom (though McDowell has stated strong disagreement with some of Brandom&#x27;s readings and appropriations of his work). Both have been influenced by Richard Rorty, in particular Rorty&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979). In the preface to &quot;Mind and World&quot; (pp. ix–x) McDowell states that &quot;it will be obvious that Rorty&#x27;s work is [...] central for the way I define my stance here.&quot;

<text>Marcel Theo Hall (April 8, 1964 – July 16, 2021), known professionally as Biz Markie, was an American rapper and singer. Markie&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;Just a Friend&quot;, became a Top 40 hit in several countries and was named No. 100 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest hip-hop songs of all time in 2008. Markie was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Clown Prince of Hip Hop&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Markie was born in Manhattan in the neighborhood of Harlem, New York City, on April 8, 1964. He was raised on Long Island in the hamlet of Brentwood and the village of Patchogue, where he spent his teenage years and where, on September 25, 2021, the intersection of South Street and West Avenue, across the street from his then-home, was dedicated as Biz Markie Way. He graduated from Longwood High School in Middle Island in 1982. Markie began his career in New York City nightclubs and later gained regional recognition by performing at colleges in Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Regarding the origin of his stage name, the rapper said:

Biz comes from the first hip-hop tape I heard. It was &#x27;77, &#x27;78, from the L Brothers. Grand Wizard Theodore was the DJ, and the rappers was Kevvy Kev, Master Rob and Busy Bee Starski. I loved Busy Bee. Busy Bee just stuck with me. My name used to be Bizzy B Markie, and after a while I put the Biz with the Markie. My nickname in my neighborhood was Markie.

== Music career ==
=== 1980s ===
Biz Markie was interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary &quot;Big Fun in the Big Town&quot;. Markie released his debut album &quot;Goin&#x27; Off&quot; in 1988, which attracted a fair amount of attention, largely due to the lead single, &quot;Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz&quot;. The album also featured the underground hit singles &quot;Nobody Beats The Biz&quot;, &quot;Vapors&quot;, and &quot;Pickin&#x27; Boogers&quot;. Biz also appeared briefly in the music video for Rob Base&#x27;s single &quot;It Takes Two&quot;.

On October 10, 1989, Markie&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Biz Never Sleeps&quot;, was released on Cold Chillin&#x27;/Warner Bros. Records, produced by Markie, his cousin Cool V and Paul C. The single &quot;Just a Friend&quot;, in which he alternates between rap and caterwauling, became Markie&#x27;s most successful single, reaching No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The song interpolates the 1968 song &quot;You Got What I Need&quot; by singer-songwriter Freddie Scott, whose basic chord and melody provided the base for the song&#x27;s chorus. &quot;Just a Friend&quot; was ranked 81st on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders in 2000, and later as number 100 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop in 2008. The music video, directed by Lionel C. Martin, chronicles the rapper&#x27;s woman problems.

=== 1990s ===
Markie&#x27;s third studio album &quot;I Need a Haircut&quot; was released on August 27, 1991, on Cold Chillin&#x27;/Warner Bros. Records; it was produced by Markie and his cousin Cool V. Sales of the album were already low when Markie was served a lawsuit by Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, who claimed that the album&#x27;s &quot;Alone Again&quot; featured an unauthorized sample from his hit &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s claim was upheld in a landmark ruling, &quot;Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot; that altered the landscape of hip-hop, finding that all samples must be cleared with the original artist before being used. In accordance with the ruling, Warner Bros., the parent company of Cold Chillin&#x27;, had to pull &quot;I Need a Haircut&quot; from circulation, and all companies had to clear samples with the samples&#x27; creators before releasing the records. This development reflected the increasing popularity of hip-hop and the financial stakes involved. Markie responded in 1993 with the mischievously titled &quot;All Samples Cleared!&quot;, but his career had been hurt by the publicity emanating from the lawsuit, and the record suffered accordingly.

For the remainder of the decade, Markie occasionally made television appearances, including guest appearances on &quot;In Living Color;&quot; as contestant Damian &quot;Foosball&quot; Franklin in the recurring game show sketch &quot;The Dirty Dozens&quot;; as Marlon Cain in &quot;Ed Bacon: Guidance Counselor&quot;; in a 1996 freestyle rap commercial on MTV2; and in the 1993 superhero film &quot;Meteor Man&quot;. He also made numerous guest appearances with the Beastie Boys on &quot;Check Your Head&quot; (1992), &quot;Ill Communication&quot; (1994), &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; (1998), and their anthology &quot;The Sounds of Science&quot; (1999). He also rapped on the song &quot;Schizo Jam&quot; on Don Byron&#x27;s 1998 release, &quot;Nu Blaxploitation&quot; (Blue Note/Capitol) and worked with Canibus on the first track on the &quot;Office Space&quot; soundtrack (1999). He also rapped on the track &quot;So Fresh&quot; alongside Slick Rick on Will Smith&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Willennium&quot;.

In 1996, Markie appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD, &quot;America Is Dying Slowly&quot;, alongside Wu-Tang Clan, Coolio, and Fat Joe, among others. The CD was meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African-American men. In 1997, a sample of a Markie recording appeared in the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot; from their album &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;. Markie also teamed up with Frankie Cutlass on his third single and music video titled &quot;The Cypher Part 3&quot; with some of Marley Marl&#x27;s Juice Crew veterans. He also appeared of Fünf Sterne deluxe&#x27;s song &quot;Will Smith, Meer Gayne?&quot; from the album &quot;Sillium&quot;.

In 1999, Markie appeared on Len&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; on their album &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop the Bum Rush&quot;, as well as on Alliance Ethnik&#x27;s album &quot;Fat Comeback&quot;.

Between 2002 and 2003, he appeared in episode 5 of the TV series &quot;Fastlane&quot; playing himself as a nightclub DJ.

Markie lost more weight than anybody else in the competition. That year, he was also in an episode of &quot;The Andy Milonakis Show&quot;. In 2006, his song &quot;Pickin&#x27; Boogers&quot; appeared on the soundtrack of the Volition video game &quot;Saints Row&quot;.

<text>A power station, also referred to as a power plant and sometimes generating station or generating plant, is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid.

Many power stations contain one or more generators, rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three-phase electric power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current.
The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Low-carbon power sources include nuclear power, and use of renewables such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric.

==History==
In early 1871 Belgian inventor Zénobe Gramme invented a generator powerful enough to produce power on a commercial scale for industry.

In 1878, a hydroelectric power station was designed and built by William, Lord Armstrong at Cragside, England. It used water from lakes on his estate to power Siemens dynamos. The electricity supplied power to lights, heating, produced hot water, ran an elevator as well as labor-saving devices and farm buildings.

In January 1882 the world&#x27;s first public coal-fired power station, the Edison Electric Light Station, was built in London, a project of Thomas Edison organized by Edward Johnson. A Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler powered a steam engine that drove a generator. This supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road, which was the monopoly of the gas companies. The customers included the City Temple and the Old Bailey. Another important customer was the Telegraph Office of the General Post Office, but this could not be reached through the culverts. Johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead, via Holborn Tavern and Newgate.
In September 1882 in New York, the Pearl Street Station was established by Edison to provide electric lighting in the lower Manhattan Island area. The station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890. The station used reciprocating steam engines to turn direct-current generators. Because of the DC distribution, the service area was small, limited by voltage drop in the feeders. In 1886 George Westinghouse began building an alternating current system that used a transformer to step up voltage for long-distance transmission and then stepped it back down for indoor lighting, a more efficient and less expensive system which is similar to modern systems. The war of the currents eventually resolved in favor of AC distribution and utilization, although some DC systems persisted to the end of the 20th century. DC systems with a service radius of a mile (kilometer) or so were necessarily smaller, less efficient of fuel consumption, and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central AC generating stations.

AC systems used a wide range of frequencies depending on the type of load; lighting load using higher frequencies, and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies. The economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems, operating at a common frequency, were developed. The same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day, could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening, thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall. Many exceptions existed, generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency, and rotating frequency changers and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network.

Throughout the first few decades of the 20th century central stations became larger, using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency, and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost. High-voltage AC transmission allowed hydroelectric power to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets. The advent of the steam turbine in central station service, around 1906, allowed great expansion of generating capacity. Generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines, and could grow to enormous sizes. For example, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti planned what would have reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station, but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size. Building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure. Pioneers of central station generation include George Westinghouse and Samuel Insull in the United States, Ferranti and Charles Hesterman Merz in UK, and many others.

==Thermal power stations==
In thermal power stations, mechanical power is produced by a heat engine that transforms thermal energy, often from combustion of a fuel, into rotational energy. Most thermal power stations produce steam, so they are sometimes called steam power stations. Not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power, according to the second law of thermodynamics; therefore, there is always heat lost to the environment. If this loss is employed as useful heat, for industrial processes or district heating, the power plant is referred to as a cogeneration power plant or CHP (combined heat-and-power) plant. In countries where district heating is common, there are dedicated heat plants called heat-only boiler stations. An important class of power stations in the Middle East uses by-product heat for the desalination of water.

The efficiency of a thermal power cycle is limited by the maximum working fluid temperature produced. The efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used. For the same steam conditions, coal-, nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency. Overall, if a system is on constantly (base load) it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently (peak load). Steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity.

Besides use of reject heat for process or district heating, one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles in a combined cycle plant. Most commonly, exhaust gases from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine. The combination of a &quot;top&quot; cycle and a &quot;bottom&quot; cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone.

In 2018, Inter RAO UES and State Grid planned to build an 8-GW thermal power plant, which&#x27;s the largest coal-fired power plant construction project in Russia.
===Classification===


====By heat source====
* Fossil-fuel power stations may also use a steam turbine generator or in the case of natural gas-fired power plants may use a combustion turbine. A coal-fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler. The steam drives a steam turbine and generator that then produces electricity. The waste products of combustion include ash, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide. Some of the gases can be removed from the waste stream to reduce pollution. 
* Nuclear power plants use the heat generated in a nuclear reactor&#x27;s core (by the fission process) to create steam which then operates a steam turbine and generator. About 20 percent of electric generation in the US is produced by nuclear power plants.
* Geothermal power plants use steam extracted from hot underground rocks. These rocks are heated by the decay of radioactive material in the Earth&#x27;s core.
* Biomass-fuelled power plants may be fuelled by waste from sugar cane, municipal solid waste, landfill methane, or other forms of biomass.
* In integrated steel mills, blast furnace exhaust gas is a low-cost, although low-energy-density, fuel.
* Waste heat from industrial processes is occasionally concentrated enough to use for power generation, usually in a steam boiler and turbine.
* Solar thermal electric plants use sunlight to boil water and produce steam which turns the generator.
* Hydrogen power plants can use green hydrogen from electrolysis to help balance supply and demand from Variable renewable energy sources.

====By prime mover====
A prime mover is a machine that converts energy of various forms into energy of motion.
* Steam turbine plants use the dynamic pressure generated by expanding steam to turn the blades of a turbine. Almost all large non-hydro plants use this system. About 90 percent of all electric power produced in the world is through use of steam turbines.
* Gas turbine plants use the dynamic pressure from flowing gases (air and combustion products) to directly operate the turbine. Natural-gas fuelled (and oil fueled) combustion turbine plants can start rapidly and so are used to supply &quot;peak&quot; energy during periods of high demand, though at higher cost than base-loaded plants. These may be comparatively small units, and sometimes completely unmanned, being remotely operated. This type was pioneered by the UK, Princetown being the world&#x27;s first, commissioned in 1959.
* Combined cycle plants have both a gas turbine fired by natural gas, and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine to produce electricity. This greatly increases the overall efficiency of the plant, and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas.
* Internal combustion reciprocating engines are used to provide power for isolated communities and are frequently used for small cogeneration plants. Hospitals, office buildings, industrial plants, and other critical facilities also use them to provide backup power in case of a power outage. These are usually fuelled by diesel oil, heavy oil, natural gas, and landfill gas.
* Microturbines, Stirling engine and internal combustion reciprocating engines are low-cost solutions for using opportunity fuels, such as landfill gas, digester gas from water treatment plants and waste gas from oil production.

====By duty====
Power plants that can be dispatched (scheduled) to provide energy to a system include:
* Base load power plants run nearly continually to provide that component of system load that does not vary during a day or week. Baseload plants can be highly optimized for low fuel cost, but may not start or stop quickly during changes in system load. Examples of base-load plants would include large modern coal-fired and nuclear generating stations, or hydro plants with a predictable supply of water.
* Peaking power plants meet the daily peak load, which may only be for one or two hours each day. While their incremental operating cost is always higher than base load plants, they are required to ensure security of the system during load peaks. Peaking plants include simple cycle gas turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines, which can be started up rapidly when system peaks are predicted. Hydroelectric plants may also be designed for peaking use. 
* Load following power plants can economically follow the variations in the daily and weekly load, at lower cost than peaking plants and with more flexibility than baseload plants.

Non-dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy; while their long-term contribution to system energy supply is predictable, on a short-term (daily or hourly) base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred. Contractual arrangements (&quot;take or pay&quot;) with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non-dispatchable.

===Cooling towers===


All thermal power plants produce waste heat energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced. The amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity. Gas-fired power plants can achieve as much as 65% conversion efficiency, while coal and oil plants achieve around 30–49%. The waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere, which is small compared to that produced by greenhouse-gas emissions from the same power plant. Natural draft wet cooling towers at many nuclear power plants and large fossil-fuel-fired power plants use large hyperboloid chimney-like structures (as seen in the image at the right) that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the evaporation of water.

However, the mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants, nuclear power plants, fossil-fired power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, geothermal, biomass and waste-to-energy plants use fans to provide air movement upward through down coming water and are not hyperboloid chimney-like structures. The induced or forced-draft cooling towers are typically rectangular, box-like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the down-flowing water.

In areas with restricted water use, a dry cooling tower or directly air-cooled radiators may be necessary, since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make-up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive. These coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans, compared to a typical wet, evaporative cooling tower.

=== Air-cooled condenser (ACC) ===
Power plants can use an air-cooled condenser, traditionally in areas with a limited or expensive water supply. Air-cooled condensers serve the same purpose as a cooling tower (heat dissipation) without using water. They consume additional auxiliary power and thus may have a higher carbon footprint compared to a traditional cooling tower.

===Once-through cooling systems===
Electric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean or a lake, river, or cooling pond instead of a cooling tower. This single pass or once-through cooling system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant&#x27;s heat exchangers. However, the waste heat can cause thermal pollution as the water is discharged. Power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as fish screens, to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery. These screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year. For example, the cooling system at the Indian Point Energy Center in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually. A further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather.

Water consumption by power stations is a developing issue.

In recent years, recycled wastewater, or grey water, has been used in cooling towers. The Calpine Riverside and the Calpine Fox power stations in Wisconsin as well as the Calpine Mankato power station in Minnesota are among these facilities.

==Power from renewable energy==
Power stations can generate electrical energy from renewable energy sources.

===Hydroelectric power station===
In a hydroelectric power station water flows through turbines using hydropower to generate hydroelectricity. Power is captured from the gravitational force of water falling through penstocks to water turbines connected to generators. The amount of power available is a combination of height and water flow. A wide range of Dams may be built to raise the water level, and create a lake for storing water.
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use.

===Solar===

Solar energy can be turned into electricity either directly in solar cells, or in a concentrating solar power plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine.

A solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the photoelectric effect. Inverters change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid. This type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion.

Solar thermal power plants use either parabolic troughs or heliostats to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid, such as oil. The heated oil is then used to boil water into steam, which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator. The central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors, depending on size, to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower. The heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators.

===Wind===

Wind turbines can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong, steady winds, sometimes offshore. Many different designs have been used in the past, but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three-bladed, upwind design. Grid-connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the 1970s. They thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models. With larger turbines (on the order of one megawatt), the blades move more slowly than older, smaller, units, which makes them less visually distracting and safer for birds.

===Marine===

Marine energy or marine power (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy or ocean power) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world&#x27;s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both wave power—power from surface waves, and tidal power—obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water.

The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.

===Osmosis===
Salinity gradient energy is called pressure-retarded osmosis. In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increases both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun creating energy. This method is being specifically studied by the Norwegian utility Statkraft, which has calculated that up to 25 TWh/yr would be available from this process in Norway. Statkraft has built the world&#x27;s first prototype osmotic power plant on the Oslo fjord which was opened on 24 November 2009. In January 2014, however, Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.

===Biomass===

Biomass energy can be produced from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine. Bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in gasification, pyrolysis or torrefaction reactions. Depending on the desired end product, these reactions create more energy-dense products (syngas, wood pellets, biocoal) that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity at a much lower emission rate when compared with open burning.

==Storage power stations==
It is possible to store energy and produce electrical power at a later time as in pumped-storage hydroelectricity, thermal energy storage, flywheel energy storage, battery storage power station and so on.

===Pumped storage===
The world&#x27;s largest form of storage for excess electricity, pumped-storage is a reversible hydroelectric plant. They are a net consumer of energy but provide storage for any source of electricity, effectively smoothing peaks and troughs in electricity supply and demand. Pumped storage plants typically use &quot;spare&quot; electricity during off peak periods to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. Because the pumping takes place &quot;off peak&quot;, electricity is less valuable than at peak times. This less valuable &quot;spare&quot; electricity comes from uncontrolled wind power and base load power plants such as coal, nuclear and geothermal, which still produce power at night even though demand is very low. During daytime peak demand, when electricity prices are high, the storage is used for peaking power, where water in the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to a lower reservoir through a turbine and generator. Unlike coal power stations, which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold, a hydroelectric generator can be brought into service in a few minutes, ideal to meet a peak load demand. Two substantial pumped storage schemes are in South Africa, Palmiet Pumped Storage Scheme and another in the Drakensberg, Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme.

==Typical power output==
The power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the watt, typically megawatts (106 watts) or gigawatts (109 watts). Power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical, geographical and economic factors. The following examples offer a sense of the scale.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China. As of 2022, the Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world, producing 8000 MW of power, followed by the Zhang Jiakou (3000 MW). As of January 2022, the Hornsea Wind Farm in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 1218 MW, followed by Walney Wind Farm in United Kingdom at 1026 MW.

In 2021, the worldwide installed capacity of power plants increased by 347 GW. Solar and wind power plant capacities rose by 80% in one year. , the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are led by Bhadla Solar Park in India, rated at 2245 MW.

Solar thermal power stations in the U.S. have the following output:
:Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is the largest of the country with an output of 392 MW
Large coal-fired, nuclear, and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts. Some examples:
:The Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa has a rated capacity of 1860 megawatts. 
:The coal-fired Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in the UK has a rated capacity of 2 gigawatts.
:The Aswan Dam hydro-electric plant in Egypt has a capacity of 2.1 gigawatts.
:The Three Gorges Dam hydro-electric plant in China has a capacity of 22.5 gigawatts.

Gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts. Some examples:
:The Indian Queens simple-cycle, or open cycle gas turbine (OCGT), peaking power station in Cornwall UK, with a single gas turbine is rated 140 megawatts.
:The Medway Power Station, a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station in Kent, UK, with two gas turbines and one steam turbine, is rated 700 megawatts.

The rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that the power station can produce.
Some power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time, as a non-load-following base load power plant, except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

However, many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity.

In some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an intermittent energy source.
Operators try to pull maximum available power from such power plants, because their marginal cost is practically zero, but the available power varies widely—in particular, it may be zero during heavy storms at night.

In some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons.
The cost of fuel to run a load following power plant may be relatively high, and the cost of fuel to run a peaking power plant is even higher—they have relatively high marginal costs.
Operators keep power plants turned off (&quot;operational reserve&quot;) or running at minimum fuel consumption (&quot;spinning reserve&quot;) most of the time.
Operators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower-cost plants (i.e., intermittent and base load plants) can produce, and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow.

===Output metering===
Not all of the generated power of a plant is necessarily delivered into a distribution system. Power plants typically also use some of the power themselves, in which case the generation output is classified into &quot;gross generation&quot;, and &quot;net generation&quot;.

Gross generation or gross electric output is the total amount of electricity generated by a power plant over a specific period of time. It is measured at the generating terminal and is measured in kilowatt-hours (kW·h), megawatt-hours (MW·h), gigawatt-hours (GW·h) or for the largest power plants terawatt-hours (TW·h). It includes the electricity used in the plant auxiliaries and in the transformers.

:Gross generation = net generation + usage within the plant (also known as in-house loads)

Net generation is the amount of electricity generated by a power plant that is transmitted and distributed for consumer use. Net generation is less than the total gross power generation as some power produced is consumed within the plant itself to power auxiliary equipment such as pumps, motors and pollution control devices. Thus

:Net generation = gross generation − usage within the plant ( in-house loads)

==Operations==

Operating staff at a power station have several duties. Operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment. They maintain the equipment with periodic inspections and log temperatures, pressures and other important information at regular intervals. Operators are responsible for starting and stopping the generators depending on need. They are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system, without upsetting the system. They must know the electrical and mechanical systems to troubleshoot problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility. Operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it.

<text>Oscar Jackson Jr. (born October 29, 1967), better known by his stage name Paris, is an American rapper and record producer from San Francisco, California, known for his highly charged political and socially conscious lyrics. Influenced by the Black Panthers, he was once a member of the Nation of Islam.

==Biography==
===1990s===
Paris became known in the US in 1990 with the hit single &quot;The Devil Made Me Do It&quot; and album of the same name, after earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of California, Davis. Originally released on Tommy Boy Records, his first video was banned by MTV.

When his second album, &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, was ready for release in 1992, Paris was dropped from now-defunct Tommy Boy Records (since rechristened Tommy Boy Entertainment in 2002) and distributor Warner Bros. Records, owned by Time Warner, when the parent company discovered its incendiary content, which included fantasy revenge killings of then-President Bush and racist police officers. Also problematic was the album&#x27;s insert, which featured the artist waiting behind a tree, holding a TEC-9, as the president was waving to the crowd. Paris eventually released the LP himself on his newly formed Scarface Records. Also in 1992, Paris contributed to industrial music band Consolidated&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Play More Music&quot; with the track &quot;Guerrillas in the Mist.&quot;

Paris signed a major artist and distribution deal with Priority Records for himself and Scarface Records in 1993 and released his third LP, &quot;Guerrilla Funk&quot;, and several then up-and-coming groups, most notably The Conscious Daughters. Paris and Priority formally severed their business relationship due to creative differences in 1995, and in 1997, Paris signed a one-off deal with now-defunct Whirling Records (distributed by Rykodisc) for the release of his fourth LP, &quot;Unleashed&quot;, which was released in small numbers with little promotion. The album contained some very explicitly violent and racially charged verses, and while less overtly political as earlier efforts, the lyrics explicitly describe racial violence when confronted with the same. Also released in Europe with a different track list, the album featuring songs from 1994, 1996 and 1998, some of which were more in the style of his earlier releases. Becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the music industry, Paris retired from recording and worked as a stockbroker, cementing his personal wealth allowing him to independently finance the next stage of his musical endeavors.

===2000s===
In 2003, Paris returned with the album, &quot;Sonic Jihad&quot;. The album continued his tradition of controversial cover art, evoking images of the September 11 attacks, it depicts a plane flying toward the White House. Its content is equally radical and covers many topics, including the war on terror, the war in Iraq, police brutality, black-on-black violence, conditions in inner-city communities, the Illuminati, and state-sponsored terrorism. Other politically minded hip hop artists were featured on the album, including Kam, dead prez, and Public Enemy. &quot;Sonic Jihad&quot; was the catalyst for the creation of Paris&#x27; new label and web site, Guerrilla Funk Recordings, a home for projects and material of such notable acts as dead prez and Public Enemy.

Paris&#x27; anti-war anthem &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; (from &quot;Sonic Jihad&quot;) accuses &quot;the Bush Administration [of playing] a key role in orchestrating the terror attacks of September 11&quot;, saying, &quot;&quot;Ain&#x27;t no terror threat, unless approval rating&#x27;s slumpin&#x27;. So I&#x27;ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it, ain&#x27;t no other country took a part or had they hand in it&quot;.&quot; The song is featured on the 2004 compilation album &quot;Peace Not War, Vol. 2&quot;. On the 2003 Anybody Killa album &quot;Hatchet Warrior&quot;, Paris appeared with Monoxide on a track entitled &quot;Ghetto Neighbor.&quot;

In 2005, Paris completed a project with Public Enemy, &quot;Rebirth of a Nation&quot;, the title both a reference to the 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, controversial for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its racist portrayal of African Americans, and PE&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;. Although Chuck D was the primary vocal performer, Paris penned and produced the bulk of the album, which also featured N.W.A&#x27;s MC Ren, Immortal Technique, Kam, dead prez, and The Conscious Daughters.

In 2006, Paris also released &quot;Paris presents Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 1&quot;, the first in a Paris-produced compilation series that touched on subjects ranging from war and police brutality to black-on-black crime and domestic violence. It showcased contributions from Public Enemy, the Coup, dead prez, Paris, T-K.A.S.H., Kam, The Conscious Daughters, Mystic, MC Ren, Sun Rise Above, and the Stop the Violence Movement (Mobb Deep, Tray Deee, Soopafly, KRS-One, Defari, Daz, J-Ro, RBX, Bad Azz, WC, Dilated Peoples, Mac Minister, The Alchemist, Mack 10, Evidence, Defari, Everlast, and B-Real), among others.

In addition, Paris introduced the world to former Coup-member T-K.A.S.H. later that year, releasing his debut offering, &quot;Turf War Syndrome&quot;, and handling production duties as well.

In 2007, Paris released the follow-up companion piece to &quot;Rebirth of a Nation&quot;, the Public Enemy collaboration &quot;Remix of a Nation&quot;, and began laying the framework for the film division of Guerrilla Funk Recordings.

Paris inked a distribution deal with Fontana/Universal for Guerrilla Funk (with movies through Vivendi) in late 2007, and released his next album, &quot;Acid Reflex&quot;, featuring Chuck D and George Clinton, in 2008.

In 2009, Paris released &quot;Paris Presents: Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 2&quot;, the sophomore project from T-K.A.S.H., &quot;Brains All Over The Streets&quot;, and the latest offering from The Conscious Daughters, &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;.

Paris not only writes and produces songs, but also publishes information about ways to improve inner-city communities. Numerous articles can be found on various subjects in the Thought Box section of Guerrilla Funk&#x27;s website.

===2010s===
In 2010, Paris was featured in the musical documentary, &quot;Sounds Like a Revolution&quot;, and in 2011 was featured on the Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s &quot;Featuring Freshness&quot; LP. He performed at that year&#x27;s Gathering of the Juggalos, and later at the Amsterdam Hiphopfestival in Amsterdam.

Paris&#x27; production and original material has been featured in various Hollywood offerings, including Morgan Freeman&#x27;s HBO documentary &quot;Prom Night in Mississippi&quot; in 2009, &quot;End of Watch&quot;, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña in 2012, and 2014&#x27;s &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;, starring Jeremy Renner.

In November 2014, he released a video single, &quot;Night of the Long Knives,&quot; which called for an increased unity in the black and brown communities and the adoption of the eye-for-an-eye philosophy toward racist police aggression and brutality in the wake of the tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri and other high-profile shooting deaths.

In August 2015, Paris released his second video single, &quot;Buck, Buck, Pass,&quot; a commentary on gun violence, its often ignored racial implications and its after effects.

His album &quot;Pistol Politics&quot; was released on September 11, 2015. It was named one of the Best Hip-Hop albums of 2015 by &quot;SPIN&quot; magazine and received an &quot;A−&quot; rating by &quot;VICE&quot;.

Paris&#x27; third single and video, &quot;Hard Truth Soldier (Redux)&quot; was released in November 2015.

Paris became an official contributor to Vice Media in June 2016, beginning his ongoing relationship with that outlet to provide political and entertainment insights on current events from an urban perspective.

Paris rounded out 2016 with contributions to Level 33 Entertainment&#x27;s mystery/suspense thriller, &quot;Blood in the Water&quot;.

2018 found Paris&#x27; productions included in several movie and television offerings, including &quot;Get Shorty&quot; on the Epix network, &quot;Champaign ILL&quot; on YouTube Premium, and Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Flint Town&quot; and &quot;Hip Hop Evolution&quot;, the latter of which featured an in-depth interview by Paris.

On October 23, 2020, &quot;Safe Space Invader&#x27;s&quot; third single and video, &quot;Turned the Key,&quot; was released, addressing the hard topics of gentrification, income inequality &amp; housing affordability.

<text>Twinkling, also called scintillation, is a generic term for variations in apparent brightness, colour, or position of a distant luminous object viewed through a medium. If the object lies outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as in the case of stars and planets, the phenomenon is termed &quot;astronomical scintillation&quot;; for objects within the atmosphere, the phenomenon is termed &quot;terrestrial scintillation&quot;. As one of the three principal factors governing astronomical seeing (the others being light pollution and cloud cover), atmospheric scintillation is defined as variations in illuminance only.

In simple terms, twinkling of stars is caused by the passing of light through different layers of a turbulent atmosphere. Most scintillation effects are caused by anomalous atmospheric refraction caused by small-scale fluctuations in air density usually related to temperature gradients. Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the horizon than near the zenith (directly overhead), since light rays near the horizon must have longer paths through the atmosphere before reaching the observer. Atmospheric twinkling is measured quantitatively using a scintillometer.

The effects of twinkling are reduced by using a larger receiver aperture; this effect is known as &quot;aperture averaging&quot;. Many modern large telescopes also use adaptive optical systems which precisely deform the figure of a mirror in order to compensate for scintillation.

While light from stars and other astronomical objects is likely to twinkle, twinkling usually does not cause images of planets to flicker appreciably.
Stars twinkle because they are so far from Earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by Earth&#x27;s atmospheric turbulence, which acts like lenses and prisms diverting the light&#x27;s path. Large astronomical objects closer to Earth, like the Moon and other planets, can be resolved as objects with observable diameters. With multiple observed points of light traversing the atmosphere, their light&#x27;s deviations average out and the viewer perceives less variation in light coming from them.

<text>A scintillation counter is an instrument for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation by using the excitation effect of incident radiation on a scintillating material, and detecting the resultant light pulses.

It consists of a scintillator which generates photons in response to incident radiation, a sensitive photodetector (usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT), a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, or a photodiode), which converts the light to an electrical signal and electronics to process this signal.

Scintillation counters are widely used in radiation protection, assay of radioactive materials and physics research because they can be made inexpensively yet with good quantum efficiency, and can measure both the intensity and the energy of incident radiation.

==History==
The first electronic scintillation counter was invented in 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran whilst he was working on the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. There was a requirement to measure the radiation from small quantities of uranium, and his innovation was to use one of the newly available highly sensitive photomultiplier tubes made by the Radio Corporation of America to accurately count the flashes of light from a scintillator subjected to radiation.

This built upon the work of earlier researchers such as Antoine Henri Becquerel, who discovered radioactivity whilst working on the phosphorescence of uranium salts in 1896. Previously, scintillation events had to be laboriously detected by eye, using a spinthariscope (a simple microscope) to observe light flashes in the scintillator. The first commercial liquid scintillation counter was made by Lyle E. Packard and sold to Argonne Cancer Research Hospital at the University of Chicago in 1953. The production model was designed especially for tritium and carbon-14 which were used in metabolic studies &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==Operation==


When an ionizing particle passes into the scintillator material, atoms are excited along a track. For charged particles the track is the path of the particle itself. For gamma rays (uncharged), their energy is converted to an energetic electron via either the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering or pair production.

The chemistry of atomic de-excitation in the scintillator produces a multitude of low-energy photons, typically near the blue end of the visible spectrum. The quantity is proportional to the energy deposited by the ionizing particle. These can be directed to the photocathode of a photomultiplier tube which emits at most one electron for each arriving photon due to the photoelectric effect. This group of primary electrons is electrostatically accelerated and focused by an electrical potential so that they strike the first dynode of the tube. The impact of a single electron on the dynode releases a number of secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated to strike the second dynode. Each subsequent dynode impact releases further electrons, and so there is a current amplifying effect at each dynode stage. Each stage is at a higher potential than the previous to provide the accelerating field.

The resultant output signal at the anode is a measurable pulse for each group of photons from an original ionizing event in the scintillator that arrived at the photocathode and carries information about the energy of the original incident radiation. When it is fed to a charge amplifier which integrates the energy information, an output pulse is obtained which is proportional to the energy of the particle exciting the scintillator.

The number of such pulses per unit time also gives information about the intensity of the radiation. In some applications individual pulses are not counted, but rather only the average current at the anode is used as a measure of radiation intensity.

The scintillator must be shielded from all ambient light so that external photons do not swamp the ionization events caused by incident radiation. To achieve this a thin opaque foil, such as aluminized mylar, is often used, though it must have a low enough mass to minimize undue attenuation of the incident radiation being measured.

The article on the photomultiplier tube carries a detailed description of the tube&#x27;s operation.

==Detection materials==
The scintillator consists of a transparent crystal, usually a phosphor, plastic (usually containing anthracene) or organic liquid (see liquid scintillation counting) that fluoresces when struck by ionizing radiation.

Cesium iodide (CsI) in crystalline form is used as the scintillator for the detection of protons and alpha particles. Sodium iodide (NaI) containing a small amount of thallium is used as a scintillator for the detection of gamma waves and zinc sulfide (ZnS) is widely used as a detector of alpha particles. Zinc sulfide is the material Rutherford used to perform his scattering experiment. Lithium iodide (LiI) is used in neutron detectors. 

==Detector efficiencies==
===Gamma===
The quantum efficiency of a gamma-ray detector (per unit volume) depends upon the density of electrons in the detector, and certain scintillating materials, such as sodium iodide and bismuth germanate, achieve high electron densities as a result of the high atomic numbers of some of the elements of which they are composed. However, detectors based on semiconductors, notably hyperpure germanium, have better intrinsic energy resolution than scintillators, and are preferred where feasible for gamma-ray spectrometry.

===Neutron===
In the case of neutron detectors, high efficiency is gained through the use of scintillating materials rich in hydrogen that scatter neutrons efficiently. Liquid scintillation counters are an efficient and practical means of quantifying beta radiation.

==Applications==

Scintillation counters are used to measure radiation in a variety of applications including hand held radiation survey meters, personnel and environmental monitoring for radioactive contamination, medical imaging, radiometric assay, nuclear security and nuclear plant safety.

Several products have been introduced in the market utilising scintillation counters for detection of potentially dangerous gamma-emitting materials during transport. These include scintillation counters designed for freight terminals, border security, ports, weigh bridge applications, scrap metal yards and contamination monitoring of nuclear waste. There are variants of scintillation counters mounted on pick-up trucks and helicopters for rapid response in case of a security situation due to dirty bombs or radioactive waste. Hand-held units are also commonly used.

===Diffusion cloud chamber ===
In the United Kingdom, the Health and Safety Executive, or HSE, has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide to the use of scintillation detectors.

==Radiation protection==
===Alpha and beta contamination===
Radioactive contamination monitors, for area or personal surveys require a large detection area to ensure efficient and rapid coverage of monitored surfaces. For this a thin scintillator with a large area window and an integrated photomultiplier tube is ideally suited. They find wide application in the field of radioactive contamination monitoring of personnel and the environment. Detectors are designed to have one or two scintillation materials, depending on the application. &quot;Single phosphor&quot; detectors are used for either alpha or beta, and &quot;Dual phosphor&quot; detectors are used to detect both.

A scintillator such as zinc sulphide is used for alpha particle detection, whilst plastic scintillators are used for beta detection. The resultant scintillation energies can be discriminated so that alpha and beta counts can be measured separately with the same detector, This technique is used in both hand-held and fixed monitoring equipment, and such instruments are relatively inexpensive compared with the gas proportional detector.

===Gamma===
Scintillation materials are used for ambient gamma dose measurement, though a different construction is used to detect contamination, as no thin window is required.

==As a spectrometer==
Scintillators often convert a single photon of high energy radiation into a high number of lower-energy photons, where the number of photons per megaelectronvolt of input energy is fairly constant. By measuring the intensity of the flash (the number of the photons produced by the x-ray or gamma photon) it is therefore possible to discern the original photon&#x27;s energy.

The spectrometer consists of a suitable scintillator crystal, a photomultiplier tube, and a circuit for measuring the height of the pulses produced by the photomultiplier. The pulses are counted and sorted by their height, producing a x-y plot of scintillator flash brightness vs number of the flashes, which approximates the energy spectrum of the incident radiation, with some additional artifacts. A monochromatic gamma radiation produces a photopeak at its energy. The detector also shows response at the lower energies, caused by Compton scattering, two smaller escape peaks at energies 0.511 and 1.022 MeV below the photopeak for the creation of electron-positron pairs when one or both annihilation photons escape, and a backscatter peak. Higher energies can be measured when two or more photons strike the detector almost simultaneously (pile-up, within the time resolution of the data acquisition chain), appearing as sum peaks with energies up to the value of two or more photopeaks added

<text>Time Sharing Option (TSO) is an interactive time-sharing environment for IBM mainframe operating systems, including OS/360 MVT, OS/VS2 (SVS), MVS, OS/390, and z/OS.

== Use ==
In computing, time-sharing is a design technique that allows many people to use a computer system concurrently and independently—without interfering with each other. Each TSO user is isolated; it appears to each one that they are the only user of the system.

TSO is most commonly used by mainframe system administrators and programmers. It provides:
* A text editor
* Batch job support, including completion notification
* Debuggers for some programming languages used on System/360 and later IBM mainframes
* Support for other vendors&#x27; end-user applications, for example for querying IMS and DB2 databases

TSO interacts with users in either a line-by-line mode or in a full screen, menu-driven mode. In the line-by-line mode, the user enters commands by typing them in at the keyboard; in turn, the system interprets the commands, and then displays responses on the terminal screen. But most mainframe interaction is actually via ISPF, which allows for customized menu-driven interaction. This combination is called &quot;TSO/ISPF&quot;. TSO can also provide a Unix-style environment on OS/390 and z/OS via the UNIX System Services command shell, with or without ISPF.

TSO commands can be embedded in REXX and ooRexx execs or CLISTs, which can run interactively or in batch.

TSO eliminated the need to punch cards on a keypunch machine, and send card decks to the computer room to be read by a card reading machine.

== History ==
Prior to TSO, IBM had introduced limited function time sharing applications such as Remote Access Computing
System (RAX), Conversational Programming System (CPS), Conversational Remote Batch Entry (CRBE) and Conversational Remote Job Entry (CRJE) for S/360. These either ran user programs only in an interpreter or had no ability to run user programs at all, only to edit, retrieve and submit batch jobs.

In addition, universities had written time sharing systems both for the 360/67, e.g., Michigan Terminal System (MTS), and for systems prior to S/360, e.g. Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS).

When it was introduced in 1971, IBM considered time-sharing an &quot;optional feature&quot;, as compared to standard batch processing, and hence offered TSO as an option for OS/360 MVT. With the introduction of MVS in 1974, IBM made it a standard component of their top-end mainframe operating system. &quot;TSO/E (&quot;Time Sharing Option/Extensions&quot;)&quot; is a set of extensions to the original TSO. TSO/E is a base element of z/OS. Before z/OS, TSO Extensions (TSO/E) was an element of OS/390 and was a licensed program for the MVS and MVS/ESA System Products. Since all z/OS installations usually have both TSO and TSO/E functions installed, it is normal to refer to both TSO and TSO/E as &quot;TSO&quot;.

When first released, TSO module names outside of SVCs always had the &quot;prefix&quot; IKJ, in some cases followed by the second and third letters of an associated pre-TSO functional group (IEA = original functional group of &quot;supervisor&quot;, hence a TSO module name of IKJEAxxx, IEB = original functional group of &quot;dataset utilities&quot;, hence a TSO module name of IKJEBxxx, etc.).

== Batch use ==
It is common to run TSO in batch (as opposed to interactively): all the usual TSO line-mode interactive commands can be also executed via Job Control Language (JCL) by running any of the programs codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 and supplying the line commands in a file pointed to by the codice_4. The primary difference between the three programs is their handling of return codes from the executed commands.

Batch execution of TSO is one way to allow an IBM mainframe application to access DB2 resources.

<text>Naturalism is a literary movement beginning in the late nineteenth century, similar to literary realism in its rejection of Romanticism, but distinct in its embrace of determinism, detachment, scientific objectivism, and social commentary. Literary naturalism emphasizes observation and the scientific method in the fictional portrayal of reality. Naturalism includes detachment, in which the author maintains an impersonal tone and disinterested point of view; determinism, which is defined as the opposite of free will, in which a character&#x27;s fate has been decided, even predetermined, by impersonal forces of nature beyond human control; and a sense that the universe itself is indifferent to human life. The novel would be an experiment where the author could discover and analyze the forces, or scientific laws, that influenced behavior, and these included emotion, heredity, and environment. The movement largely traces to the theories of French author Émile Zola.

==Background==
Literary Naturalism traces back most directly to Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;The Experimental Novel&quot; (1880), which details Zola&#x27;s concept of a naturalistic novel, which traces philosophically to Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivism, but also to physiologist Claude Bernard and historian Hippolyte Taine. Comte had proposed a scientific method that &quot;went beyond empiricism, beyond the passive and detached observation of phenomena&quot;. The application of this method &quot;called for a scientist to conduct controlled experiments that would either prove or disprove hypotheses regarding those phenomena&quot;. Zola took this scientific method and argued that naturalism in literature should be like controlled experiments in which the characters function as the phenomena. 

Naturalism began as a branch of literary realism, and realism had favored fact, logic, and impersonality over the imaginative, symbolic, and supernatural. Frank Norris, an American journalist and novelist, whose work was predominantly in the naturalist genre, &quot;placed realism, romanticism, and naturalism in a dialectic, in which realism and romanticism were opposing forces&quot;, and naturalism was a mixture of the two. Norris&#x27;s idea of naturalism differs from Zola&#x27;s in that &quot;it does not mention materialistic determinism or any other philosophic idea&quot;.
Apart from Zola and Norris, there are various literary critics who have their own separate views on the matter. As said by Paul Civello, these critics can be grouped into four broad, and often overlapping, groups: early theorists, history-of-idea critics, European influence critics, and recent theorists. The early theorists saw naturalism thematically and in terms of literary technique. The history-of-idea critics understood it as an expression of the central ideas to an era. The European influence critics viewed it in much the same way as Zola. For example, according to theorist Kornelije Kvas, naturalism presents &quot;forms of human experience not spoken of before – the physiological aspect of human behavior, sexuality, poverty – as literary topics worthy of being dealt with.&quot; Recent theorists have either re-conceptualized naturalism as a narrative form, or denied its existence entirely.

Some say that naturalism is dead, or that it &quot;may have never lived at all: even in the works of Émile Zola&quot;, its founder. &quot;In 1900 an obituary entitled &quot;The Passing of Naturalism&quot; in &quot;The Outlook&quot; officially declared the literary movement deceased&quot;, and that Zola&#x27;s attempt to create a scientific literature was a failure. This certainly was not the first time Zola&#x27;s novel had been criticized however. After his novel &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (1867) had been sharply criticized for both contents and language, in a foreword for its second edition (1868), in a mixture of pride and defiance, he wrote: &quot;Le groupe d&#x27;écrivains naturalistes auquel j&#x27;ai l&#x27;honneur d&#x27;appartenir a assez de courage et d&#x27;activité pour produire des oeuvres fortes, portant en elles leur défense&quot;, which translates as: &quot;The group of naturalist writers I have the honor to belong to have enough courage and activity to produce strong works, carrying within them their defense.&quot;

Naturalism was very popular in its time and was known in different literary traditions in Western Europe. In the Netherlands, there was Cooplandt, Couperus, Frederik van Eeden and Marcellus Emants. In Germany, the most important naturalistic writers were Gerhart Hauptmann, Arno Holz and Johannes Schlaf. In Belgium, the most important writers were Cyriel Buysse and Stijn Streuvels. In Spain, the most remarkable figure was Vicente Blasco Ibánez; In Brazil, the main writer of the genre was Aluísio de Azevedo.

== American Naturalism ==
Naturalism in American literature traces to Frank Norris, whose theories were markedly different from Zola&#x27;s, particularly to the status of naturalism within the loci of realism and Romanticism; Norris thought of naturalism as being Romantic, and thought Zola as being &quot;a realist of realists&quot;. To Link, while American naturalism had trends, its definition had no unified critical consensus. Link&#x27;s examples include Stephen Crane, Jack London, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris, with William Dean Howells and Henry James being clear markers on the other side of the naturalist/realist divide.

The center of Crane&#x27;s naturalism is recognized as &quot;The Open Boat,&quot; which portrayed a naturalistic view of man with his depiction of a group of survivors adrift in a boat. The humans with their creation confronted the sea and the world of nature. In the experiences of these men, Crane articulated the illusion of gods and the realization of the universe&#x27;s indifference.

William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;A Rose for Emily,&quot; a story about a woman who killed her lover, is considered an example of a narrative within the naturalism category. This story, which also used Gothic elements, presented a tale that highlighted the extraordinary and excessive features in human nature and the social environment that influences them. The protagonist, Miss Emily, was forced to lead an isolated life, and that – combined with her mental illness – made insanity her inevitable fate. The environment in the forms of a class structure based on slavery and social change, together with heredity, represented the forces beyond her control.

<text>BBC One is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the BBC. It is the corporation&#x27;s oldest and flagship channel, and is known for broadcasting mainstream programming, which includes BBC News television bulletins, primetime drama and entertainment, and live BBC Sport events.

The channel was launched on 2 November 1936 under the name BBC Television Service, which was the world&#x27;s first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960 and used this name until the launch of the second BBC channel, BBC2, in 1964. The main channel then became known as BBC1. The channel adopted the current spelling of BBC One in 1997.

The channel&#x27;s annual budget for 2012–2013 was £1.14 billion. It is funded by the television licence fee together with the BBC&#x27;s other domestic television stations and shows uninterrupted programming without commercial advertising. The television channel had the highest reach share of any broadcaster in the United Kingdom as at 2019, ahead of its traditional rival for ratings leadership ITV. In 2013, a study conducted across 14 countries by the polling organization Populus found BBC One to be the station most favorably viewed by its country, with BBC Two coming in third place.

==Availability==
BBC One is available via most major television providers in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Early years and launch===

The BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House, London, on 22 August 1932. The channel officially began regular broadcasts on 2 November 1936 at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London.

On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning, with the last programme to be shown being a Mickey Mouse cartoon (the 1933 short &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Gala Premier&quot;); the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft that could bomb London.

BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, &quot;Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?&quot;. Twenty minutes later, BBC Television again aired the Mickey Mouse cartoon that they had broadcast in 1939.

===Creation of BBC1===
The BBC held a statutory monopoly on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until Associated-Rediffusion, the first Independent Television (ITV) station, began to broadcast on 22 September 1955. The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities, following a large reduction in its audience, as noted in the 1962 Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting. Simultaneously, the Pilkington Report decided to award an additional television station to the BBC on the basis that ITV was in comparison lacking in serious programming.

BBC Television became BBC1 when BBC2 launched on 20 April 1964, transmitting an incompatible 625-line image on UHF. The only way to receive all channels was to use a complex &quot;dual-standard&quot; 405- and 625-line receiver with both a VHF and a UHF aerial (405-line-only sets became obsolete in 1985 when VHF transmissions ended). BBC1 moved to purpose-built facilities at Television Centre on 20 September 1969. Television News continued to use Alexandra Palace as its base and by early 1968 had even converted one of its studios to colour. In the weeks leading up to 15 November 1969, BBC1 unofficially transmitted the occasional programme in its new colour system in order to test it. At midnight on 15 November, simultaneously with ITV and two years after BBC2 had done so, BBC1 officially began 625-line PAL colour programming on UHF with a broadcast of a concert by Petula Clark. Colour transmissions could be received in monochrome via monochrome 625-line sets until the end of analogue broadcasting.

Between 1973 and 1977, BBC1 achieved an average audience share of 45% under Bryan Cowgill. This was the channel&#x27;s most successful period in terms of audience share.

On 30 December 1980, the BBC announced plans to introduce a new breakfast television service to compete with TV-am. They stated that the new show would be broadcast before TV-am but included the caveat that the new show would not launch until at least November 1981, whereupon new licence fee income could finance the necessary extension of broadcasting hours. On 17 January 1983, one year after originally planned, the first edition of &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; was shown on BBC1, becoming the first UK wide breakfast television service and continued to lead in the ratings until 1984.

===Michael Grade era (1984–1987)===
In 1984, Bill Cotton become managing director of Television at the BBC, and set about overhauling BBC1, which had been slated with poor home grown shows, its heavy reliance on US imports, with &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; being BBC1&#x27;s highest rated programmes and ratings being over 20% behind ITV. Cotton recruited Michael Grade to become Controller of BBC1 from 1 September 1984 the first time the corporation had recruited someone outside of the BBC, replacing Alan Hart, who had been criticised for his lack of knowledge in general entertainment, as he was head of BBC Sport prior to 1981.

The first major overhaul was to axe the unpopular &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; current affairs programme: this was a replacement for the news and magazine show &quot;Nationwide&quot;. Its replacement was the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, a straight news programme in a bid to shore up its failing early evening slot. It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the 18:20 slot, but this was dismissed. The Miss Great Britain contest was dropped, being described as verging on the too offensive after the January 1985 contest, with &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; and &quot;International Superstar&quot; also being cancelled.

BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 with a new look, new programming including &quot;Wogan&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and a revised schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers throughout the course of the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Omnibus&quot; were both moved after the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the channel and holding back good programmes. Grade said &quot;When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them.&quot; &quot;Wogan&quot; had been scheduled for a 10 pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7 pm slot as he believed the show had potential.

From February to August 1985, a high number of American mini-series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;, and &quot;Open All Hours&quot;. Further improvement came about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, &quot;Hold the Back Page&quot;, and &quot;Bluebill&quot;, along with the return of &quot;Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Big Deal&quot;. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised for failing to match ITV&#x27;s output in drama. &quot;EastEnders&quot; was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% for the first time since 1982.

On 27 February 1985, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was placed on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC originally planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade was the target of death threats) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) who knew what to do with the series.

On 9 September 1985, the long-standing children&#x27;s programming block was overhauled and rebranded as &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC&quot;, which gave it dedicated idents for the first time and had a live in-vision presenter, similar to rival ITV&#x27;s Children&#x27;s ITV block which had been running since January 1983. Previously the BBC had broadcast children&#x27;s programming using BBC1&#x27;s team of regular duty announcers. The launch presenter for this block, and thus the first Children&#x27;s BBC presenter of the current format, was Phillip Schofield.

On 23 May 1986, long-running lunchtime magazine show &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; was broadcast for the last time after being on air for 14 years. On 27 October 1986, BBC1 launched its daytime television schedules. In a statement, BBC Daytime head Roger Laughton said:

===1990s===

Stereo audio transmissions, using the NICAM digital stereo sound format began on BBC1 in late 1987, to coincide with the sale of the first consumer NICAM-enabled equipment, a year after BBC2, and were gradually phased in across BBC TV output, although it took until 31 August 1991 for the service to begin officially on both channels. During this time, both commercial analogue broadcasters, ITV and Channel 4 had officially begun stereo transmissions using the BBC-developed NICAM system. Widescreen programming was introduced on digital platforms in 1998.

For the first 50 years of its existence, with the exception of films and programmes purchased from the United States and elsewhere, almost all the channel&#x27;s output were produced by the BBC&#x27;s in-house production departments. This changed following the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, which required that 25% of the BBC&#x27;s television output be out-sourced to independent production companies. By 2004, many popular BBC One shows were made for the channel by independents, but the in-house production departments continued to contribute heavily to the schedule.

In March 1991, as part of the £63 million programme package for spring and summer line up on BBC1, it was announced an extra £20 million was to be spent on rejuvenating the channels drama and comedy output during peak times, to keep the channel in a healthy state once the new Channel 3 licences were awarded.

In December 1991 &quot;Wogan&quot; was to be cancelled, due to falling ratings against a number of ITV shows, in which &quot;Wogan&quot; only managed six million viewers compared to double that for &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; and &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;. Additionally an extra £40 million a year was spent on narrowing the gap on ITV&#x27;s ratings lead, since a few months prior to this the channel had been criticised for its Autumn schedule, having tired formats, uninspiring scheduling of new programmes and poor scripts. &quot;Wogan&quot; was replaced with &quot;Eldorado&quot;, in early July 1992, but this was itself cancelled a year later.

Alan Yentob launched the 1993 Autumn schedule calling it &quot;My first try with a lot of help from my friends&quot;, with the channel still under criticism, following the start of new programming which Alan introduced a year earlier, and the number of summer repeats. £175 million was spent on 80 hours of original drama produced, enchantment to the arts with an extended 26-week run for &quot;Omnibus&quot;, and documentaries with &quot;The Downing Street Years&quot;, new wildlife series and an eight-month look at Sheffield&#x27;s Children&#x27;s hospital, while &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; and &quot;The Danny Baker Show&quot; were new comedy series. &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; included in the Saturday night line up to increase variety.

Following the public disapproval of filling its schedule with 25% of repeats during the summer months of 1993, BBC1 agreed to broadcast an extra 110 hours worth of original programming over the same period during the summer in 1994, which included giving &quot;EastEnders&quot; an additional episode per week. Efficiency savings of £25 million were found and redeployed to the new productions. The savings were seen as a vindication for Producer Choice, the controversial internal market introduced in April 1993.

By March 1999, the channel admitted defeat in its ratings war with ITV, with its spring line up emphasising more on serious factual and educational programmes, and drama. This change in strategy came about after continuing complaints that the channel was appealing to the lowest common denominator to increase viewership. Reliance on docusoaps and the dropping of the vilified &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; were chastened by the hoax guests on &quot;The Vanessa Show&quot;. Alan Yentob said &quot;The spring package is to remind people of what the BBC is here for, range and ambition you won&#x27;t find anywhere else at peak time&quot;. The changes helped the channel distinguish itself from (as one BBC executive said) &quot;its down-market rival and would not compete for viewers on ITV&#x27;s terms.&quot;

===2000s===
Lorraine Heggessey became Controller of BBC One, a post she took up on 1 November 2000. She had previously been sounded out about the job in 1997 after Michael Jackson&#x27;s departure, but had turned down the opportunity as she felt she was then not yet experienced enough.

During Heggessey&#x27;s five years in charge, BBC One&#x27;s audience share fell by 19.9%, to 23%, although this was in the context of declining audience figures across all British television channels due to increased competition from multichannel digital television. However, in 2001 BBC One overtook its main rival ITV in terms of annual audience share for the first time since the rival channel had launched in 1955, although much of this was down to the success of the channel&#x27;s daytime television line-up, which had its own Controller: Jane Lush.

When Heggessey arrived at the channel in November 2000, she inherited two controversial schedule changes which had been implemented the previous month, at the behest of Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke; the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; had been moved to the later time of 22:00 and &quot;Panorama&quot; moved from Monday night prime time slot to a later slot on Sunday nights. The moving of &quot;Panorama&quot; attracted criticism that BBC One was sidelining serious programming in favour of more populist output. Heggessey publicly defended the decision, despite it not being hers, claiming that &quot;Panorama&quot; ratings would have &quot;dwindled&quot; in its previous slot.

Heggessey and the BBC&#x27;s Controller of Drama Commissioning, Jane Tranter, took advantage of the weekday 21:00 slot opening up by moving the news to commission new popular drama output, such as the successful &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; (2000–2011) and &quot;Spooks&quot; (2002–2011). Celebrity dancing show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2004–present) was also a popular success on Saturday nights, although another Saturday night entertainment series, &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, faced accusations of being too derivative of the output of commercial rivals, and during Heggessey&#x27;s era the channel frequently came under attack for being too populist and not providing enough serious programming.
Immediately after her arrival, Heggessey ordered a review of the &quot;Balloon&quot; idents the channel had been using for its between-programme idents since 1997. In her opinion, the balloon was &quot;slow and distant&quot; and so, on 29 March 2002, after much speculation, she decided to abandon the &quot;Balloon&quot; idents (and the traditional &quot;Globe&quot; idents the channel had used in a variety of forms since 1963). They were replaced by a new style of on-air identity for the channel, the &quot;Rhythm &amp; Movement&quot; idents. The new idents attracted criticism for going against the traditions of the channel and pandering to &quot;political correctness&quot;, as they featured activities performed by people of various ethnicities. The abandonment of a station clock, and perceived lack of a &#x27;serious ident&#x27;, also put the BBC in an embarrassing situation just one day into the new look with the death of the Queen Mother.

One of Heggessey&#x27;s most notable decisions and last major success at the channel was the recommissioning of the science-fiction drama series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which had been a popular hit in previous decades but ceased production in 1989. Heggessey and Jane Tranter recommissioned the series in September 2003, after Heggessey had spent two years persuading the BBC&#x27;s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, to abandon their attempts to make a feature film version of the programme and allow it to instead return it to BBC One. The new version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005–present) debuted on 26 March 2005 and became a critical and popular hit, with Paul Hoggart of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper describing the series as &quot;a joyful, exuberant reinvention and a fine legacy from Ms Heggessey.&quot;

Heggessey did later concede in a 2005 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper that arts programming had suffered a cutback under her control of BBC One. However, she did respond to this omission following criticism from the Board of Governors of the BBC by commissioning programmes such as the arts documentary series &quot;Imagine...&quot; (2003–present) and &quot;A Picture of Britain&quot; (2005).

On 14 February 2005 it was announced that Lorraine Heggessey was to leave the BBC to take up the post of Chief Executive at production company Talkback Thames. She left on 15 April. Five months after her departure, BBC One was named &quot;Channel of the Year&quot; at the Edinburgh Television Festival, primarily on the strength of Heggessey&#x27;s commissions such as &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Joining the channel as Controller in 2005, Peter Fincham oversaw the commissioning of several successful BBC One programmes including &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2006–2009), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (2006) and &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot;, which was followed by similar shows &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot; because of its success. His first full year in charge of the channel saw a year-on-year growth in the audience share, with a rise from 22.2% in August 2005 to 23.6% in August 2006.

Fincham also directly initiated the creation of both &quot;The One Show&quot; (2006–present), an early evening, current-affairs and lifestyle magazine programme, which now runs all but two weeks of the year, and &quot;Davina&quot; (2006), a prime time chat show, the latter hosted by Davina McCall, who presented &quot;Big Brother&quot;. However, &quot;Davina&quot; was a critical and ratings disaster, which Fincham subsequently admitted was personally his fault, although he defended the strategy of experimenting with the BBC One schedule. This he continued in January 2007, when he moved the current affairs series &quot;Panorama&quot; from its Sunday night slot back to the prime time Monday evening slot from which it had been removed in 2000, most likely in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming in prime time.

Fincham&#x27;s judgement was again called into question, this time by &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, for his decision to spend £1.2 million replacing the channel&#x27;s &#x27;Rhythm and Movement&#x27; idents, which had been introduced by his predecessor Lorraine Heggessey several years earlier, with the &#x27;Circle&#x27; idents, a set of eight ten-second films, some of which were shot abroad in locations such as Mexico and Croatia. Fincham later found himself having to publicly defend the £18 million salary that the BBC paid Jonathan Ross in 2006, although Ross&#x27;s BBC One work—primarily consisting of &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;—formed only part of his overall BBC commitment.

The channel was named &quot;Channel of the Year&quot; at the 2007 Broadcast Awards.

===The One to Watch campaign===

Following its rebrand in March 2002, BBC One launched &quot;The One to Watch&quot; campaign, during which animated blocks created the word &quot;The&quot; and moved into the BBC logo.
Each new campaign incorporating the theme retained the same animated sequence.
In May 2007, Fincham decided to drop &quot;Neighbours&quot;, an Australian soap opera, from BBC One after 21 years on the channel, when its producers, FremantleMedia significantly raised the price they wanted the BBC to pay for it in a bidding war. Fincham commented that it was &#x27;a big loss&#x27;, but that BBC One would not pay &#x27;the best part of £300 million&#x27;. &quot;Neighbours&quot; left the channel after the BBC&#x27;s contract to show the programme ended on 8 February 2008, and moved to Channel 5 on 11 February 2008. &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap, with the afternoon CBBC slot moving 20 minutes earlier.

There was further controversy in July 2007 when Fincham was accused of misleading BBC One viewers. The incident involved a clip from forthcoming documentary &quot;A Year with the Queen&quot; which was shown to journalists during a press conference. It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given. Fincham admitted the error, but rejected calls that he should resign from his position as a result. His future was deemed uncertain following critical comments from Sir Michael Lyons, Chairman of the BBC Trust, and he resigned on 5 October 2007.

In 2009, a report published by the BBC Trust found scheduling changes had led to a decrease in viewers. This was especially noticeable for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Newsround&quot;, two of CBBC&#x27;s flagship programmes; &quot;Blue Peter&quot; which recorded its lowest viewing numbers since it started in 1958, and &quot;Newsround&quot; with fewer than 100,000 viewers compared to 225,000 in 2007.

===2010s===

As part of the Delivering Quality First proposals submitted by the BBC in October 2011 and approved by the BBC Trust in May 2012, all children&#x27;s programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear &quot;Children&#x27;s programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere.&quot; Children&#x27;s programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by &quot;Teletubbies&quot; co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as &quot;ghettoising children&#x27;s programmes&quot; and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said &quot;On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There is a certain amount of overlooking of the fact that children&#x27;s programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of ... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children&#x27;s programming is because it is life-enhancing.&quot; Head of BBC Children&#x27;s, Joe Godwin said: &quot;Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children&#x27;s programmes. Far from being a &#x27;cynical&#x27; move, we&#x27;re just following where our audience has already gone.&quot;

As part of the review in 2012 other changes were brought in, including:
* BBC One is reducing the minimum hours of arts and music from 45 to 40, achieved through cutting episodes of shows, in particular Film 2013.
* BBC One and Two will &quot;largely be protected from making significant cuts&quot;.
* Repeats on BBC One will increase, but remain under 10% of all output (the current rate is 8.4%).
* Expenditure on sports rights will be cut by 15%. This had largely been achieved already by sharing rights to Formula 1 coverage from 2012 (it was later dropped entirely from 2016).

In 2012, the BBC out-bid ITV for the rights to air a &quot;British&quot; version of Dutch TV talent show &quot;The Voice&quot;. The BBC paid £22 million for the rights to broadcast the show in the UK for two years. &quot;The Voice UK&quot; achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped towards the end of the first series and the second series. In 2013, &quot;The Voice UK&quot; was rescheduled to avoid a clash, and as a result, ratings have improved. In November 2015, it was announced that &quot;The Voice UK&quot; would be moving to ITV from 2017, especially because of the ITV plc ownership of franchise owner, Talpa Media.

==Sister channels==

===BBC One +1===
On 8 October 2013, the BBC announced plans to launch a one-hour time shift of the channel, named BBC One +1. The channel would have replaced BBC Three in 2016. However, on 30 June 2015, the BBC Trust rejected the plans for a BBC One +1 channel as they stated that it would be at the expense of commercial rivals.

===BBC One HD===

BBC One HD, a simulcast of BBC One in 1080i high definition (HD), launched on 3 November 2010 at 19:00 with &quot;The One Show&quot;. The channel simulcasts the national version of BBC One in High Definition, with HD versions of programmes including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot;, &quot;The One Show&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. &quot;EastEnders&quot; was also made available in HD from Christmas Day 2010. All programmes still made in standard definition were upscaled on the channel, with the intention that by 2012 the vast majority of the channel&#x27;s output would be in high definition. On 30 May 2012, the satellite and terrestrial resolution was increased to full HD.

BBC One HD at launch did not offer regional variations, and therefore the channel could not broadcast during regional programming slots, most noticeably the local news programmes. The BBC Trust admitted that this was due to technical and financial constraints, but the BBC announced on 6 June 2011 that the national variations of BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC One Scotland and BBC One Wales, would become available from 2012. On 24 October 2012, Northern Ireland received the first variation. A Scottish variation launched on 14 January 2013, followed by a Welsh variation on 29 January 2013. On 16 July 2013, the BBC indicated that it also wants to launch regional variants of BBC One HD across England; however, this would require the approval of the BBC Trust, with a proposal due to be presented within six months. On 18 November 2013, the Northern Irish regional variant of BBC One HD was swapped with the SD channel on Sky&#x27;s EPG for HD subscribers. This was followed by the Welsh and Scottish variants on 10 December. On 24 March 2014, BBC One Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland HD launched on Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media outside the regions they were originally seen in.

On 31 March 2016, BBC One HD in England moved from channel 141 on the Sky electronic programme guide to channel 115, a position vacated by BBC Three, which had been switched to internet-only six weeks earlier. Changes in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland were also scheduled but delayed for &#x27;technical reasons&#x27;.

==== Regionalised BBC One HD launch ====
On 22 November 2022, the BBC announced that BBC One will finally be regionalised on their HD channels. This move started on Sky Glass, followed by Virgin Cable, and then in the 2023 new year, HD programmes are launched on satellite. With the launch of the HD channels, this also means the closure of the SD channels. SD channels are shut on satellite 24 hours after the launch of the HD channel, and are moved up to the Channel 1/Channel 101 slot on the EPG. Viewers with older standard definition set-top boxes will no longer be able to receive BBC One. All BBC satellite channels in standard definition have closed on 8 January 2024.

BBC Alba HD, BBC Red Button 1 HD and BBC Parliament HD will also launch on satellite at a similar time. The BBC and Freesat launched a website with a guide, telling users how to make sure they are upgraded at www.hdsatelliteupgrade.co.uk.

Regional programming began on BBC One HD in certain regions on 22 March 2023; it began in the remaining regions on 26 April 2023.

==Contemporary programming==


Excluding sporting events and news coverage, the top five most watched programmes at their peak viewing points (according to BARB) were:

With a mission to provide programmes for all licence-fee payers, it has sport, news, current affairs, and documentaries. It has historically broadcast children&#x27;s programmes (now taken from CBBC and CBeebies). The channel remains one of the principal television channels in the United Kingdom and provides 2,508 annual hours of news and weather, 1,880 hours of factual and learning, 1,036 hours of drama, 672 hours of children&#x27;s, 670 hours of sport, 654 hours of film, 433 hours of entertainment, 159 hours of current affairs, 92 hours of religion and 82 hours of music and arts.

Since 1990, the BBC has had to commission output from other domestic suppliers. Although the statutory target remains 25% for independent production companies to contribute programming for BBC One, 33% of output was made by them in 2010–11. The quota of original programming in peak times is set at 90%; however, 100% of peak programming was original in 2010–11. Over the whole day, the total for the same year was 89%, against a quota of 70%.

2,508 annual hours of news and weather (293 in peak, 1,049 of BBC News simulcasts) are provided by regular news programmes &quot;BBC News&quot;, &quot;&#x27;BBC Business Today&quot;, &quot;BBC Newsday&quot;, &quot;Sportsday&quot;, &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; and the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; each including BBC regional news programmes. All three main news bulletins have a lead over their rival programmes on ITV and other terrestrial or cable channels. During the weekend period, three separate bulletins around these three time periods are broadcast and vary in length from 10 to 25 minutes. BBC One has broadcast overnight simulcasts from the BBC News Channel since 1997; the latter in turn simulcasts the majority of all regular BBC One bulletins. When BBC One is broadcasting a BBC News special, it hands some of its daytime programming to BBC Two.

Each year 159 hours of current affairs programmes are broadcast on BBC One, including &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Watchdog&quot;. Politics is also covered, with programmes including &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot; shown. &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, a programme appealing for help in unsolved crimes, is broadcast monthly.

BBC One shows 1,880 hours of factual and learning programming annually. This includes a wide range of shows such as nature documentaries such as &quot;Planet Earth&quot; as well as lifestyle-format daytime programmes and a number of &quot;reality television&quot; formats and the &quot;One Life&quot; strand.

BBC One broadcasts 1,036 hours of drama each year, more than any other BBC channel. There are four half-hour episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; each week (not shown on Friday), plus the hospital drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. Other popular dramas on BBC One include crime dramas such as &quot;New Tricks&quot;, a programme of which even episode repeats have beaten ITV ratings on numerous occasions.

BBC One has traditionally been the home of children&#x27;s television: &quot;Blue Peter&quot; had been broadcast on the channel prior to the Children&#x27;s BBC strand, and sections such as the pre-school &quot;Watch with Mother&quot; being transmitted on the channel for several decades. This became more pronounced with the launch of Children&#x27;s BBC, later renamed &quot;CBBC&quot;. This new strand was broadcast primarily on BBC One in the late afternoons, as well as Saturday and Sunday mornings also such as &quot;Going Live!&quot; and &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, each lasting two to three hours. The launch in 2002 of dedicated digital channels for this content —the CBBC and CBeebies channels —did not affect this provision. Combined with BBC Two, the channel broadcast 2,195 hours of children&#x27;s programmes in 2010, mostly in the late afternoons on weekdays. Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming moved to BBC Two in 2006 following a three-month trial.

Sports coverage on BBC One includes Premier League football highlights on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, the Wimbledon Championships, the London Marathon, and other international athletics and swimming events, the Olympic Games, Rugby league, Rugby Union, Snooker tournaments, the American Super Bowl, and more.

The BBC showed the 2010 FIFA World Cup, splitting the group stage matches with ITV. The BBC had first pick of matches from the second round. Repeats made up 8.4% of peak programming in 2010–11, up from 8.0% for 2008–09. Programming on this channel costs an average of £162,900 per hour.

British and international films are broadcast for 654 hours each year on BBC One. This is mainly late-night fillers with some box office hits at Christmas and holiday periods.
Sometimes on a Saturday afternoon there is a film on to fill the gap between entertainment shows but very rarely has there been one in that slot.

Entertainment programming on BBC One includes game shows such as the &quot;National Lottery&quot;, &quot;Total Wipeout&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and chat shows such as &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;.

The annual 92 hours of religious programming comprise weekly editions of live &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;, Christian services and other shows from independent production companies. Mentorn Oxford produces &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, described as &quot;a new multi-faith programme featuring a panel and a studio audience&quot;, followed by &quot;Life from the Loft&quot; which is made by the Leeds-based company True North. In 2005 BBC One was criticised for reducing the amount of religious programming, previously 101 hours per year.

BBC One broadcasts many comedy programmes, often on Friday nights. These have included the stand-up comedy show &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;, sitcom &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, and satirical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Saturday evening is also a popular slot for a comedy show such as &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s Big Show&quot; and &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot;.

Since BBC Three became an online-only service in 2016, BBC One broadcast some BBC Three programming, particularly such as &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot;, &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot; and &quot;This Country&quot;. In March 2019, BBC1 had a dedicated timeslot for BBC3 as a programming block. The block was dropped when BBC Three returned as a linear TV channel in early 2022, but BBC One continues to broadcast some BBC Three programmes.

As the weekly popular music chart programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was dropped in 2006 (except for the Christmas Day edition), BBC One broadcast 49 hours of music and arts programming in 2010. The majority of this was &quot;Imagine&quot;, presented by Alan Yentob, and classical music concerts, in particular some of the &quot;BBC Proms&quot;.

BBC One&#x27;s daytime line-up was a major factor in it overtaking ITV as the most popular channel in 2000, a position it has retained, even though ITV achieves a higher audience share during the daytime. The morning daytime line-up consists of lifestyle shows, such as &quot;Morning Live&quot;, &quot;Homes Under the Hammer&quot; and &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;, the afternoons contain drama with daily soap &quot;Doctors&quot; and classic US drama, such as &quot;&quot;. Sometimes a drama such as &quot;Land Girls&quot; is shown in the afternoons.

Between 15:25 and 17:35 was the CBeebies/CBBC broadcasting strand, with its own visual identity. Historically, BBC One&#x27;s most popular daytime programme was &quot;Neighbours&quot;, with audience figures approaching five million. On 11 February 2008, BBC One dropped &quot;Neighbours&quot; and the programme was broadcast on Channel 5 until 2022. In its place was the quiz show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, which was moved from BBC Two, and later replaced in 2011 by &quot;Pointless&quot;. Children&#x27;s programmes were broadcast from 15:05 - 17:15 to accommodate this change and this continued until December 2012 when the afternoon CBeebies/CBBC block was axed.

On 16 May 2012, the BBC announced the children&#x27;s block of shows would be moved permanently to CBBC and CBeebies upon the completion of the Digital switchover. In its place appear the game show &quot;Perfection&quot;, plus &quot;Escape to the Country&quot; and &quot;Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is&quot;.

In February 2022, the BBC confirmed that &quot;EastEnders&quot; will get a Monday to Thursday slot at 7.30pm with the programme due to form part of a BBC soap hour which will include a repeat of daytime soap &quot;Doctors&quot; on BBC Two at 7pm. Due to this decision, the BBC One regional slot will be pushed back half an hour to 8pm on Wednesdays, where it will feature programmes such as documentary series &quot;We Are England&quot;.

==Presentation==


BBC One&#x27;s identity has been symbolised by a globe shown on its idents for much of its existence. The first BBC ident was shown on 2 December 1953, known as the Bat&#x27;s Wings. In 1962 this was replaced by a map of the UK shown between programmes, and in 1963 the globe appeared, changing in style and appearance over the next 39 years.

Most notably, on 18 February 1985, the &quot;Computer Originated World&quot; was introduced. This was a computer-animated globe with the land coloured gold and the sea a transparent blue, giving the impression of a glass globe. This was replaced by the &quot;Virtual Globe&quot; on 16 February 1991. On 4 October 1997, the globe became a red, orange and yellow hot-air balloon, coloured to resemble a globe. It was filmed flying around various places in the UK.

On 29 March 2002, the globe was replaced by a series of visual identities, &quot;idents&quot;, consisting of people dancing in various styles. These were replaced on 7 October 2006 by the &#x27;circle&#x27; idents. According to the BBC, the circle symbol both represents togetherness (unity) and acts as a link to the classic globe icon used for 39 years. They ran until 4 December 2016, when that year&#x27;s Christmas idents launched. On 1 January 2017, a new ident set launched, based on the theme of &quot;oneness&quot;. Following complaints from viewers on social media that the 2017 set of BBC One idents were not good examples of social distancing amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic in the UK, BBC One temporarily suspended the 2017 idents on 1 May 2020 in favour of a special set of idents that adhere towards the social distancing guidelines. The idents were reinstated on 19 July 2021 when the UK government lifted some Coronavirus restrictions until the new Lens idents arrived the following year on 1 April 2022.

==Regional variations==

BBC One has individual continuity and opt-outs for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each variant maintains the BBC One logo with the addition of the constituent country name beneath it.

In England, each region has an individual regional news and current affairs programme opt-out as well as a limited amount of continuity. &quot;UK Today&quot;, a news programme, was shown nationally to digital viewers in place of regional programmes when they were unavailable to broadcast on analogue television. The programme was discontinued in 2002 and replaced by a transmission of &quot;BBC London News&quot; until all BBC regions were made available digitally.

BBC One Scotland has the greatest level of variation from the generic channel, owing to BBC Scotland scheduling Scottish programming on the main BBC Scotland channel, rather than on BBC Two. BBC One Scotland variations include the soap opera &quot;River City&quot; and the football programme &quot;Sportscene&quot;, the inclusion of which causes programming to be displaced or replaced.

BBC One Wales was considered a separate channel by the BBC as early as its launch in the mid-1960s, appearing as BBC Wales.

==Availability outside the UK==
BBC One (Northern Ireland) is widely available in Ireland on cable and satellite television. BBC One (especially the London feed) is also available on cable and IPTV in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco and Liechtenstein. The channel is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through the Luxembourgish Broadcasting Regulator – ALIA.

On 27 March 2013 it was offered by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS1 TV channel, which already carried a selection of BBC One programmes.

All feeds of BBC One in both SD and HD are broadcast unencrypted on the Astra 2E and 2G satellites, allowing viewing across Belgium, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and parts of France, Germany and Spain.

==Accessibility==

The BBC announced in May 2008 that it had achieved its aim for all programming to have subtitles for viewers with hearing difficulties. The BBC also offers audio description on some popular BBC One programmes for visually impaired viewers. The percentage of the BBC&#x27;s total television output with audio description available is 10%, having been increased from 8% in 2008.

<text>Harold Ray Ragsdale (born January 24, 1939), known professionally as Ray Stevens, is an American country and pop singer-songwriter and comedian. He is best known for his Grammy-winning recordings &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Misty&quot;, as well as novelty hits such as &quot;Gitarzan&quot; and &quot;The Streak&quot;. Stevens has received gold albums for his music sales and has worked as a producer, music arranger, and television host. He is also an inductee of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, the Christian Music Hall of Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Early life==
Harold Ray Ragsdale was born on January 24, 1939, in Clarkdale, Georgia. He is the elder of two sons born to Willis Harold Ragsdale (1915–2001) and Frances Stephens Ragsdale (1916–1997). His younger brother, John, who died in 2020 at the age of 75, became an actor and writer. While attending high school, Stevens formed his first band, a rhythm and blues group named The Barons. He began studying business administration at Georgia State College, but very quickly switched to become a music major. Stevens left after completing three of the four years required to obtain a degree, which he felt that he did not need.

==Career==
===Early career===
At the age of 18, Stevens signed to Capitol Records&#x27; Prep Records division in 1957, and produced the single &quot;Silver Bracelet&quot;, with a cover of &quot;Rang Tang Ding Dong&quot; as the B-side. The single was met with a positive review from &quot;Billboard&quot;. The B-side was originally recorded by doo-wop group The Cellos in 1956.

Stevens signed with Mercury Records in 1961.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Stevens became a producer and studio musician in Nashville. He recorded songs for Barnaby Records and Warner Brothers during 1970–79. Stevens&#x27; biggest hit in the U.S. was his gospel-inflected single &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot; (1970). It won a Grammy Award, was the theme song for his summer 1970 TV show, a number one hit on both the pop and Adult-Contemporary charts, and marked his first time in the Top 40 on the country charts, peaking at number 39. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.

Stevens had a transatlantic chart-topping hit in 1974 with &quot;The Streak&quot;, a novelty song about streaking that reached number one on the American and British singles charts.

Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some exceptions (such as &quot;Shriner&#x27;s Convention&quot; in 1981), Stevens focused mostly on serious material, as he felt that the novelty song was becoming less popular in the era. Stevens had an adult contemporary crossover hit in 1979 with &quot;I Need Your Help Barry Manilow&quot;, a cut from Stevens&#x27;s Barry Manilow tribute/parody album &quot;The Feeling&#x27;s Not Right Again&quot;.

===1980s===
Stevens then joined MCA in 1984. Feeling that novelty songs were becoming popular again, he authorized the rush release of &quot;Mississippi Squirrel Revival&quot; in 1984, which reached the country top 20. In 1985, Stevens performed at the Lanierland Music Park in Georgia with Pinkard &amp; Bowden.

===21st century===
In February 2002, following the September 11 attacks, Stevens released &quot;Osama—Yo&#x27; Mama: The Album&quot; after the title track, which was released as a single in late 2001, peaked at #48 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 2001. The album reached #29 on the US Top Country Albums chart.

In April 2010, Stevens released &quot;We the People&quot;, a CD/DVD of political songs. This album reached Top-5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Comedy Album chart.

&quot;RAY-ality TV&quot; ended its digital TV run in January 2014. Two months later, a webisode series, also titled &quot;Rayality TV&quot; was launched. Later in 2014, Stevens co-starred in the movie &quot;Campin&#x27; Buddies&quot;.

Stevens published his autobiographical memoir &quot;Ray Stevens&#x27; Nashville&quot; in 2014.

In 2015, Stevens began producing and hosting &quot;Ray Stevens Nashville&quot;, a 30-minute weekly music variety show on cable TV. Since then, the show has been rebranded as &quot;Ray Stevens CabaRay Nashville&quot; and is now filmed on stage at his own CabaRay Showroom, which opened to the public in early 2018.

Stevens released the album &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; on March 24, 2015, which includes the Taylor Swift spoof single &quot;Taylor Swift is Stalking Me&quot; and &quot;Come to the USA&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stevens was married to Penny Jackson Ragsdale for over 60 years, until her death on December 31, 2021, after a lengthy battle with cancer. Two days prior, he had canceled his New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at CabaRay, due to Penny&#x27;s rapidly declining health. They had two daughters, Suzi and Timi, and four grandchildren.

<doc id="212172" wikidata="Q752945" url="?curid=212172" title="At Last the 1948 Show">
<text>At Last the 1948 Show is a satirical television show made by David Frost&#x27;s company, Paradine Productions (although it was not credited on the programmes), in association with Rediffusion London. Transmitted on Britain&#x27;s ITV network in 1967, it brought Cambridge Footlights humour to a broader audience.

The show starred and was written by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Marty Feldman. Cleese and Brooke-Taylor were also the programme editors. Aimi MacDonald (usually billed as &quot;the lovely Aimi MacDonald&quot;) was the cheerfully ditsy host who introduced the show and also appeared in occasional (and brief) in-show linking segments, but she did not appear in sketches. The director was Ian Fordyce. Chapman and Cleese would later be among the founders of the Monty Python comedy troupe, and several of the sketches first performed in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; would later be performed by Monty Python in various formats. Cleese and Chapman&#x27;s future Python partner Eric Idle appears as a bit part player in a few sketches; similarly, Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s future &quot;Goodies&quot; partner Bill Oddie appears in some small roles.

While only two episodes of the show had been thought to survive, efforts to locate missing episodes have been fruitful, with seven episodes being accounted for by 2013. On 23 October 2014, two episodes were recovered by the British Film Institute from the David Frost collection, and a further two episodes were recovered the following year, making the number of complete episodes eleven out of thirteen.

==History==
Frost approached Cleese, Chapman and Brooke-Taylor to star in a sketch series. They suggested Marty Feldman, until then a comedy writer. The series bridged the radio series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; and television&#x27;s &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;The Goodies&quot;. It also led to Feldman&#x27;s television series &quot;Marty&quot; (which also featured Tim Brooke-Taylor). The convention of comedy scenes interspersed by songs was abandoned. It still used punchlines, which would often be dispensed with in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

Several sketches came from the 1963 Cambridge Footlights Revue entitled &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; (the revue was previously entitled &quot;A Clump of Plinths&quot;), including Graham Chapman&#x27;s solo routine &quot;One-Man Wrestling&quot;. Certain sketches from the show would later be reused in the one-off John Cleese special &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; (&quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;), as well as the second episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; (&quot;One-Man Wrestling&quot; again – now with play-by-play commentary added by Cleese – and &quot;Hearing Aid Shop&quot;). Further sketches were reprised in the Python stage shows, including the &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; sketch (as featured on &quot;Live at Drury Lane&quot;, &quot;Live at City Center&quot;, &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,&quot; and &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;), &quot;One-Man Wrestling&quot; once again (&quot;Drury Lane&quot;, &quot;City Center&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Bowl&quot;), &quot;Secret Service&quot; (&quot;Drury Lane&quot; only), and a few that have never received official release: &quot;Beekeeper,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Hearing Aid Shop,&quot; and &quot;Minister Falling to Pieces&quot;. The &quot;Beekeeper&quot; sketch was also performed in the Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball stage shows, as were &quot;Top of the Form&quot; and &quot;Take Your Clothes Off!&quot;. Another, the &quot;Bookshop&quot; sketch, was recorded in modified form for &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;. New versions of &quot;Door to Door Undertaker&quot; and &quot;Memory Training Course&quot; were also recorded during that album&#x27;s sessions, but not included on the final version (they would, however, end up appearing on the widely bootlegged &quot;Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck&quot; album). &quot;Psychiatrist&quot;, &quot;Tea Boy on a Mission&quot;, and &quot;Grublian Holidays&quot; were also performed again by &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;.

Monty Python&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;And now for something completely different,&quot; parodying a phrase often used on Blue Peter, originated in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, and was originally spoken by Aimi MacDonald.

The shows had no relationship to the year 1948; according to Cleese, the title referred to television executives&#x27; tendency to dither extensively over commissioning decisions. Feldman claimed in &quot;eyE Marty&quot;, his posthumously published autobiography, that he came up with the title, which &quot;meant nothing&quot;. The series was video-taped at Rediffusion&#x27;s Wembley Studios.

A total of thirteen 25-minute episodes were made within a year, six in the first series and seven in the second.

===Survival of episodes===
Thames Television discarded the material once they had acquired the Rediffusion London archive, and all but two episodes were destroyed. John Cleese became aware of tapes from two surviving episodes after Feldman&#x27;s wife left them to him in her will. Five compilation episodes for Swedish television also survived. Much missing material has been recovered in video, and surviving video has been restored by the British Film Institute.

The majority of a previously missing episode (season 2, episode 6, broadcast 31 October 1967) was recovered from a private collector in May 2010. On 23 October 2014, the BFI announced film copies of two previously missing episodes – the first and final episodes of the series (broadcast 15 February 1967 and 7 November 1967) – had been recovered from the private collection of the show&#x27;s executive producer David Frost. A year later, the BFI announced the recovery of another two episodes from a fan&#x27;s collection, with one of the new recoveries - the third episode of the first series (tx 1 March 1967) – to be screened at the &quot;Radio Times&quot; Festival at Hampton Court on 25 September 2015.

Out of an original total of 13 episodes, eleven now exist in complete or near-complete form, while two remain incomplete. While most surviving episodes are from original tapes or telerecordings, two of the complete episodes have been reconstructed from footage recovered from five compilation tapes returned from Sweden. The two incomplete episodes&#x27; surviving footage also comes from these compilations. The complete audio of all 13 episodes exist, recorded off air by several fans.

A 1967 LP release featured sketches taken from the soundtrack of the show&#x27;s first series, accompanied by a 7&quot; single featuring newly recorded versions of &quot;The Ferret Song&quot; and &quot;The Rhubarb Tart Song&quot;. These have since been reissued on CD.

=== Home media ===
The five Swedish compilation episodes were released on DVD in July 2005 by Tango Entertainment in the US (Region 1) and in January 2007 by Pinnacle Vision in the UK (Region 2). This includes the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, written and performed by Cleese, Chapman, Brooke-Taylor and Marty Feldman. The DVD incorrectly states these as &quot;recently recovered episodes&quot;, presents them as episode numbers 1 through 5, in the wrong compilation-series order (the correct order is DVD ep# 4, 3, 1, 5, 2), with no mention on the DVD that the content is in fact a compilation. The episodes on all DVD releases are soft, grainy, and generally low picture quality, even considering the material&#x27;s age. Eric Idle appears in three of the episodes (2, 4, and 5), but never speaks except for a brief line in the teaser of episode 4.

The DVD was re-released in May 2012 by One Media iP, a digital-only (streaming media format) label (no physical DVD) based in the UK, available for free on their OMP YouTube channel. This release has the compilation episodes in the same (mis-)order, and includes the 2 bonus interview tracks from the original DVD as well. They describe the episodes as compilations, but their description of what original episodes they are taken from is wrong (one episode claims the excerpts are all from series 1 when in fact they are all from series 2).

In October 2015, One Media iP acquired the rights to three original full episodes that had recently been discovered, and released them on their YouTube channel as well. They are the two episodes discovered in David Frost&#x27;s archives, ep. #1.1 and #2.7, and the episode discovered in a fan collection and screened in 2015, ep. #1.3. The three episodes are presented in the wrong aspect ratio: the picture is squeezed horizontally to a ratio of 1:1 square.

In recent years, some of the other surviving, original full episodes have been uploaded on YouTube and other video-sharing websites. All of these have since been removed, and new uploads continue to be removed, due to claimed copyright restrictions and new YouTube rules, as well as internet policing by One Media iP. The five compilation episodes (in the same mis-order) plus the three original full episodes released by One Media iP are still available for free on YouTube, on the free streaming service Tubi, and on Amazon Prime, the subscription streaming provider. On Tubi and Amazon Prime, the three original episodes are numbered 6 through 8 in order of broadcast: ep. #1.1, 1.3, and 2.7 respectively. On these latter two providers, the squeezed 1:1 aspect ratio of episode #7 (1.3) is corrected.

The British Film Institute released a comprehensive three-DVD set of the surviving material on 16 September 2019, including audio-only portions for all missing segments.

As of July 2020, the BritBox streaming service has the thirteen episodes available for viewing.

<text>ITV1 (formerly known as ITV) is a British free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by the British media company ITV plc. It provides the Channel 3 public broadcast service across all of the United Kingdom except for the central and northern areas of Scotland where STV provides the service.

ITV1 as a consistent national channel (with dedicated slots for regional news and other regional programmes) evolved out of the old ITV network – a federation of separately owned regional companies which had significantly different local schedules and branding. During the 1990s, the differences between the schedules in each region gradually reduced – partly through the consolidation of ownership and partly through the standardisation in the volume and scheduling of regional programmes.

In 2002, a major change of appearance occurred when all ITV regions in England and Wales adopted national continuity. Regional logos vanished and regional names were mentioned only before regional programmes. Effectively this left ITV1 in England and Wales looking like a national channel with slots for regional opt-outs – similar to channels like BBC One and France&#x27;s France 3 – rather than a group of independent regional broadcasters sharing programmes.

The unification was consolidated in 2004 when Granada plc acquired Carlton Communications to form ITV plc. By then, the two companies had acquired all the regional Channel 3 companies in England and Wales. ITV plc later acquired Channel Television in the Channel Islands and UTV in Northern Ireland.

ITV1 is today the biggest and most popular commercial television channel in the United Kingdom. ITV1, and its predecessor regional channels, have contended with BBC One for the status of the UK&#x27;s most watched television channel since the 1950s. However, in line with the other former analogue channels, ITV1&#x27;s audience share has fallen as a result of availability of multi-channel television, and more recently streaming services, in the UK.

==History==

Following the creation of the Television Act 1954, the establishment of a commercial television service in the UK began.

The Independent Television service, later abbreviated to &quot;ITV&quot;, was made up of distinct regions, with each region run by different franchisee companies. The three largest regions, London, the Midlands, and the North of England, were initially sub-divided into weekday and weekend services, with a different company running each. The first use of the name &quot;ITV1&quot; for the network was as a tuning button label on some TV sets sold in the UK in the 1970s in contemplation of the eventual launch of a fourth national channel to be named ITV2 - this service eventually materialised as Channel 4.

The service was very heavily regulated until the early 1990s. The regulator, the ITA (and later the IBA) operated the transmitters, awarded franchises and had a great influence over schedules, content and technical standards. Legally the regulator was the broadcaster – the companies were contracted to provide an &quot;independent television service&quot; to compete with the BBC.

The ITV network existed in a region-heavy form from its inception through to the 2000s, although the switch to a single unified service was gradual.

ITV1 became the generic on-screen brand name used by the twelve franchises of the ITV network in the United Kingdom. The ITV1 brand was introduced on 11 August 2001 by the franchisees owned by Carlton and Granada, initially used alongside the local regional name, such as &quot;ITV1 Anglia&quot; and &quot;ITV1 Meridian&quot;. However, it became the sole on-air identity in October 2002 when the two companies decided to create a single unified playout of the channel, with regional references used only prior to regional programming, such as local news and weather. Carlton and Granada went on to merge in 2004, creating ITV plc, which now owns thirteen of the fifteen regional ITV licences.

The ITV1 name was only used in England, Wales, Southern Scotland, and Isle of Man, until Channel Television adopted the name in January 2006, bringing it to the Channel Islands. As national continuity is often used on Channel Television, ITV1 national branding had been seen on the station for several years previously.

The licensees that use the ITV1 brand are: ITV Anglia, ITV Border, ITV Central, ITV Channel Television, ITV Cymru Wales, ITV Granada, ITV London (weekday), ITV London (weekend), ITV Meridian, ITV Tyne Tees, ITV West Country, ITV Yorkshire, and UTV.

ITV Wales &amp; West was the only exception, using the name &quot;ITV1 Wales&quot; at all times for the Welsh part of its broadcast area, as it has a higher regional commitment. Latterly, the &quot;ITV1 Wales&quot; name was only used on break-bumpers and regionally advertised programmes until 2013. Non ITV plc-owned licensees on the ITV network, nowadays only STV Group, generally did not refer to the ITV name.

The network production arms of nowadays ITV plc-owned licensees have been gradually combined since 1993, to eventually form ITV Studios.

==Corporate unification==
The ITV1 channel was formed by the unification of eleven of the ITV licences. The United Kingdom Broadcasting Act 1990 changed many of the rules regulating the ITV network, which most notably relaxed separate franchise ownership, and hours of production. However, as far back as 1974, Yorkshire Television and its North East neighbour, Tyne Tees Television, formally created Trident Television, a merged entity of the two companies. By 1981, due to regulation, the company was forced to de-merge; however, they resumed their alliance in 1993 as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, which therefore owned the two franchises, and integrated the two companies&#x27; assets more than its predecessor.

The intense race to own a larger share of the ITV network began in 1994, when Carlton Communications, the owner of London weekday broadcaster Carlton Television, took control of Central Independent Television in the Midlands. Days afterwards, Granada plc, owner of Granada Television of the North West, purchased London Weekend Television (LWT). Meridian&#x27;s owner, Mills and Allen International, then went on to purchase Anglia Television in the same year, before merging to become United News and Media (UNM) in 1995. UNM then went on to purchase Wales and West broadcaster, HTV in 1996, while Carlton purchased Westcountry Television later that year. Granada then agreed a deal to take over Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television in 1997, giving the broadcaster access to both Yorkshire and North East franchises.

There was no further movement in the take-over of franchises until 2000, when Border Television and all of its radio assets were sold to Capital Radio Group, who consequently sold the television broadcasting arm to Granada Media Group. Granada then went on to purchase all of UNM&#x27;s television interests (including its ITV franchises), which brought Meridian and Anglia into its power, but due to regulation, Granada was forced to sell HTV&#x27;s franchise to Carlton while acquiring HTV&#x27;s production facilities. By this time, all of the franchises in England and Wales were owned by either Carlton or Granada.

On 2 February 2004, Granada plc officially merged with Carlton Communications, creating ITV plc, although it was in effect, a takeover by Granada. In 2011, ITV plc acquired Channel Television from its private owners Yattendon Group plc. On 19 October 2015, ITV announced they were to buy UTV for £100 million subject to regulatory approval. The deal also included UTV Ireland, UTV&#x27;s Irish channel. Initially, the UTV name was retained, but on 2 April 2020 the station began using ITV&#x27;s national continuity-at first as an emergency measure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, then announced as a permanent transition on 26 November 2020.

===Regional variations===

The ITV1 channel consists of thirteen regional franchises in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which each broadcast regional news and other local programming to its area. Many franchise areas in England have sub-regions providing separate regional news bulletins. For example, the Anglia region is divided into West and East. This arrangement was suspended in February 2009, when ITV implemented plans to save the company £40m a year on the amount it spent making local news, but was reinstated (with slightly fewer sub-regions) on 16 September 2013.

Since 27 October 2002, on all ITV plc-owned franchises, regional programming has been preceded or plugged by an oral regional announcement, in the format ITV1 &quot;regional brand&quot;; e.g. ITV1 Granada. In English regions, up until 13 November 2006, regional names were also superimposed (post-production) on these idents below the ITV1 logo, but this practice has since ceased. ITV Wales remains unaffected, and still continues to use dual-branding across all of its on-screen presentation. Despite the lack of regional names on screen, the regional name is usually spoken by the continuity announcer prior to local programmes. After ITV1&#x27;s unification in 2002, the two London franchises, Carlton Television and London Weekend Television were merged into a single entity, ITV London, while the Wales and West franchise lost its official identity, and instead was substituted with ITV1 Wales and ITV1 West on-air, with no reference linking the two together (the licence was formally split in two by Ofcom from 1 January 2014, when the West region merged with the Westcountry region to form the West Country franchise).

Channel Television adopted the ITV1 brand on-air prior to the 2011 ITV plc takeover of the channel. UTV was purchased by ITV plc in 2016, but did not adopt national continuity until April 2020 (see above).

Areas with full ITV1 channel branding and continuity:


In the English regions (plus Border Scotland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man), the channel was known from 2006 until 2013 as ITV1, from 2013 until 2022 as ITV, and from 15 November 2022, ITV1 at all times. Regional references no longer appear before any programming at all in these areas.
* The &quot;ITV Cymru Wales&quot; brand is name-checked only by local ITV promos and ITV announcers;
* The &quot;UTV&quot; branding in Northern Ireland is only used for local programming.
* The &quot;STV&quot; branding in the Central and North of Scotland regions is used throughout the day from 9:25 am to 6 am daily;

ITV network areas without full ITV1 channel branding and continuity:
===Regional changes 2009–2013===
In June 2007, ITV plc executive chairman Michael Grade hinted at a possible re-structure of the ITV regional layout, stating the existence of smaller regional services &quot;no longer makes sense&quot; relative to the regional audience they serve. The plan was confirmed in September 2007, reducing the number of regional news programmes from 17 to just 9, saving around £35 to £40 million each year, and affecting every ITV plc regional company with the exception of ITV London, ITV Wales, and ITV Granada. These changes were implemented in early 2009. All sub-regional news programmes ceased; ITV Border&#x27;s &quot;Lookaround&quot; programme was merged with ITV Tyne Tees&#x27; &quot;North East Tonight&quot; programme, ITV Westcountry&#x27;s &quot;Westcountry Live&quot; merged with ITV West&#x27;s &quot;The West Tonight&quot; programme, and ITV Meridian&#x27;s &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; south and south east editions merged with ITV Thames Valley&#x27;s &quot;Thames Valley Tonight&quot;.

On 16 September 2013, ITV reverted to a more localised system, as was the case prior to a shake-up in 2009, with 14 news regions (rather than eight). This meant people in the Borders, for example, saw a return to a Border-only news service, with all stories covered solely on Southern Scotland and Cumbria, similar to the pre-Tyne Tees merger in February 2009. Meanwhile, in the Westcountry, viewers in Devon and Cornwall also saw a return to a more localised service.

==Notable programming==
==Subsidiary channels==
===ITV1 HD===
A high-definition simulcast of ITV1, ITV1 HD, debuted on 7 June 2008, with the technical launch of the Freeview HD service. The channel has its roots in ITV HD, which began as a trial service in 2006 on a low-power digital terrestrial (DVB-T) channel from London&#x27;s Crystal Palace transmitting station, and on Telewest TV Drive cable service. The channel was revived on 7 June 2008, in time for the UEFA Euro 2008 football tournament, this time exclusively available on the Freesat digital satellite service. With its debut on Freeview HD, the channel was re-branded as ITV1 HD in December 2009.

===ITV1 +1===
 The time-shift channel ITV1 +1 launched on all TV platforms, including Freeview in 2011.

==Availability outside the UK==
ITV channels are available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In the Republic of Ireland, ITV (as UTV) was widely available; however, UTV Ireland was launched in 2015 and replaced UTV in the Republic of Ireland. UTV has since ceased broadcasting in Ireland. ITV is registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through ALIA in Luxembourg.

Since 27 March 2013, ITV1 London has been offered by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS3 TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.

==Branding==
===ITV network===

ITV was not consistently promoted as a brand name until 1989 although the name was in common public use. Independent Television, shortened to ITV, was the collective and generic name for the companies which held commercial television franchises. The name referred to the initial regulator the Independent Television Authority (ITA). It was keen to use this name for its franchisees to highlight the fact they were also public services and not simply commercial broadcasters. In the early years, the network was sometimes referred to as the &quot;ITA network&quot;, and the companies as &quot;ITA contractors&quot; or &quot;ITA stations&quot;. The companies were principally identified on air using by their own names though some did make reference to ITV too. There were also specific uses of the ITV name – for instance, ITV Schools, ITV Sport, and Children&#x27;s ITV were used for programming strands.

In 1989, the ITV Association set out a basic package with a new &quot;ITV&quot; logo, which included idents, promotions and general on and off air design, and an edit of this package was designed for each franchise holder within the ITV network. The dual branded idents included a large &quot;ITV&quot; logo, in which the &quot;V&quot; contained part of the franchise logo, and written below the logo in a grey capitalised font was the name of the regional broadcaster. However, only half of the regional broadcasters opted to use the package, which had completely failed by 1997.

In 1998, another second ITV common presentation (once again using dual-branding with the ITV name) was launched, under the theme, &quot;TV from the Heart&quot;. In 1999, ITN News was rebranded ITV News.

By 2001, all eleven franchises of England and Wales were owned by either Granada plc or Carlton Communications, and a new common name, ITV1, was launched on 11 August 2001.

===ITV1 / ITV channel===

On 28 October 2002, regional continuity and idents were dropped in the English regions while the service in Wales was rebranded ITV1 Wales. At this time all English regional continuity announcers were replaced with a single team of national continuity announcers – initially, there were six but the number was later reduced to just four. 

In 2005, ITV plc introduced a new channel branding called ITV Day, used to identify ITV1 between 9:25am and 6:00pm. ITV Day was treated as a separate entity to ITV1 and featured its own presentation set focusing using the colours of red, orange and yellow and featured scenes of typical &quot;daytime&quot; activities. Promotions were used in a similar format to ITV1, and all daytime programmes advertised within ITV1 hours branded with the ITV Day logo. A similar &quot;UTV Day&quot; branding was adopted in Northern Ireland.

In January 2006, the channel adopted a new on-air look, designed mainly to improve cross-channel promotion across ITV&#x27;s multichannel presence. The new logo brought ITV1, ITV2, and ITV3 in line with ITV4&#x27;s and had been observed on various billboard ads in the UK when the new identity was first used on-screen on 16 January 2006. The overhaul also put an end to the former ITV Day brand, which was axed in favour of a full-time ITV1 identity.

On 14 January 2013, ITV unveiled a huge rebranding, including a new corporate logo inspired by handwriting, and the renaming of the flagship channel back from ITV1 to just ITV. Its colour schemes vary on-air to complement its surroundings; a practice referred to internally as &quot;colour picking&quot;. Following the buyout in 2016, UTV also rebranded to these idents, using a tweaked version with the new UTV logo. 

On 1 January 2019, ITV refreshed its on-air presentation again. The logo and trailers were modified to use a different colour scheme, but the main change was to the idents. In a project known as ITV Creates, a new set of idents were used weekly. They were built around interpretations of the ITV logo commissioned from British visual artists. The first artist featured was Ravi Deepres. UTV continued with its 2013-era idents until it adopted ITV continuity and trials in 2020. However, it used the new on-air presentation on trails with a tweaked version to accommodate the UTV logo.

On 15 November 2022, ITV renamed the channel back from ITV to ITV1 which was used as the name on the channel between 2001 and 2013. ITV1 also received another rebrand, as part of a redesign of all ITV&#x27;s main channels, being carried out in tandem with the launch of the streaming service ITVX. The logo is now coloured blue and uses idents that are cross-used across ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and ITVBe with different views which reflect the channel&#x27;s image and programming output.

<text>Sidney Sussex College (referred to informally as &quot;Sidney&quot;) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in England. The College was founded in 1596 under the terms of the will of Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex (1531–1589), wife of Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, and named after its foundress. In her will, Lady Sidney left the sum of £5,000 together with some plate to found a new College at Cambridge University &quot;to be called the Lady Frances Sidney Sussex College&quot;. Her executors Sir John Harington and Henry Grey, 6th Earl of Kent, supervised by Archbishop John Whitgift, founded the Protestant College seven years after her death.

Sir Benjamin Lockspeiser, the first president of CERN was also an undergraduate at the college, along with psychiatrist W. Ross Ashby. Robert McCance Professor of Experimental Medicine, played a leading part in wartime rationing and 1940s government nutrition efforts. Professor Dame Ann Dowling has been a Fellow since 1977 and is the President of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The inaugural recipient of the Rosalind Franklin award Professor Sue Gibson was an undergraduate at the college. The &quot;father of radio astronomy in Australia&quot; Joe Pawsey obtained his PhD at Sidney Sussex in 1935.

Sidney Sussex is one of the smaller colleges at Cambridge, with its sister college being St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. The student body comprises approximately 355 undergraduates, 275 postgraduates, and around 80 fellows.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===

Before Sidney&#x27;s founding as a Protestant seminary, the site was home to the Grey Friars, or Franciscans, for nearly three centuries. In the 1950s, excavations revealed remnants of the complex, a lay graveyard with reburied skeletons, shattered stained glass, and a large Saxon jar. The medieval cellars beneath Hall Court, where Sidney&#x27;s wine is stored, are remnants of this era.

The college was founded in 1596 under the terms of the will of Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex (1531–1589), wife of Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, and named after its foundress. It was from its inception an avowedly Protestant foundation; &quot;some good and godlie moniment for the mainteynance of good learninge&quot;. In her will, Lady Frances Sidney left the sum of £5,000 together with some plate to found a new college at Cambridge University &quot;to be called the Lady Frances Sidney Sussex College&quot;. Her executors Sir John Harington and Henry Grey, 6th Earl of Kent, supervised by Archbishop John Whitgift, founded the college seven years after her death.

=== Expansion ===
While the college&#x27;s geographic size has changed little since 1596, an additional range was added to the original E-shaped buildings in the early 17th century and the appearance of the whole college was changed significantly in the 1820s and 1830s, under the leadership of the master at the time, William Chafy. By the early 19th century, the buildings&#x27; original red brick was unfashionable and the hall range was suffering serious structural problems. 

The opening up of coal mines on estates left to the college in the 18th century provided extra funds, which were to be devoted to providing a new mathematical library and accommodation for mathematical exhibitioners. Also with those funds, the exterior brick was covered with a layer of cement, the existing buildings were heightened slightly, and the architectural effect was also heightened, under the supervision of Sir Jeffry Wyatville.In the late nineteenth century, the college&#x27;s finances received a further boost from the development of the resort of Cleethorpes on college land on the Lincolnshire coast. This land had been purchased in 1616, following a bequest for the benefit of scholars and fellows by Peter Blundell, a merchant from Tiverton, Devon. A new wing (Cloister Court), added in 1891 to the designs of John Loughborough Pearson, is stylistically richer than the original buildings and has stone staircases, whereas the stairs in the older buildings are made of timber.

In the early twentieth century, a High Church group among the fellows was instrumental in the rebuilding and enlargement of the chapel, which was provided with a richly carved interior in late seventeenth-century style, designed by Thomas Henry Lyon, and somewhat at odds with the college&#x27;s original Puritan ethos.

== Buildings and grounds ==
Sidney&#x27;s buildings blend old and new, with the latest addition, the Old Kitchen (new dining space), completed in 2021. Student rooms have kitchen access, but also have catered options. Sidney sits on the site of Cambridge&#x27;s Franciscan friary, built in the middle of the 13th century and dissolved in the 1530s. Artefacts of the site&#x27;s past lie beneath the foundations of the college buildings. Sidney Sussex has two courtyards surrounded by Grade I listed buildings dating from 1596.
=== Chapel Court ===

This court incorporates a number of buildings that house offices, the Junior Common Room (JCR) and a wood panelled chapel. The Chapel, for which this court is named, has gone through many forms over the years. The current building was rebuilt in the 18th century, and has been extended a number of times in subsequent centuries. The exterior was entirely remodelled in 1833 to match the Gothic style of the rest of the buildings.

The carved interior of the Chapel was installed in the early 20th century to suit the High Church tastes of a group of college fellows. The Chapel is open throughout the day as a space for the college community, regardless of faith or background.

Hall Court

Hall Court is enclosed by a range of Gothic buildings incorporating the Master&#x27;s Lodge, Buttery and the new Kitchen buildings, but the Court&#x27;s name comes from Sidney&#x27;s Dining Hall. The dining hall was redesigned by Sir James Burrough in 1752. The hall had been in poor repair, and the &#x27;elegant Rococo room&#x27; that emerged from the remodelling was seen as a way to attract students and Fellows. Sidney&#x27;s Dining Hall features decorated plasterwork, pillars, and an elaborate rococo ceiling with a centrepiece of scrolls and acanthus foliage. A portrait of the college&#x27;s founder, Lady Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex, is mounted over the high table. 

=== Cloister Court ===
Cloister Court, completed in 1891, was designed by John Loughborough Pearson in the Gothic revival style, incorporating elements that reflect the Franciscan heritage of the site.

== Chapel and music ==

The old chapel, built by James Essex in the 1770s, was very small at 20 by 30 feet. The old bell, bought from Pembroke Hall in 1707 and recast in 1739, was retained until 1930 when it was replaced with a new one. The work to the new chapel was completed in 1923. The antechapel now contains wall memorials to the dead of the two world wars and to three masters, Parris, Elliston and Chafy. The presence of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s head, buried somewhere nearby, is marked by a tablet installed in 1960. 

The Choir of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge is made up of six to eight sopranos, six altos (male and female), six tenors, three baritones, and three basses. During term-time the choir has a regular commitment in the chapel to Choral Evensong on Fridays and Sundays and Latin Choral Vespers on Wednesdays. 

A number of choral scholarships are available for members of the Sidney Choir. In addition to singing Evensong in the chapel, the Choir has made some recordings and tours regularly in the UK and overseas. The Choir was nominated for a 2013 Gramophone Award in recognition of their disc of the music of Thomas Weelkes. The Sidney Sussex College Music Society organises concerts and recitals, and the college runs a number of instrumental and vocal ensembles. The Sidney Chapel includes a Steinway grand piano, a harpsichord, a chamber organ and a Flentrop organ.

== Student life ==
=== Boat Club ===

Founded in 1837, the men&#x27;s side of the club has spent most of its time in the 2nd division of the Lent and May Bumps, with brief times spent in the 1st and 3rd divisions. The men&#x27;s side of the club generally crews two boats in the Lent Bumps and three boats in the May Bumps. Being a small college, the club has never had the consistency to rise to take a headship of either event, and has been as high as 6th in the Lent Bumps in 1913, and 11th in the May Bumps in 1923.

A women&#x27;s crew was first formed in 1978 and has spent most of its time hovering between 1st and 2nd divisions in both the Lent and May Bumps. Sidney&#x27;s 1st Women&#x27;s VIII re-entered division 1 of the Lent Bumps in 2022 for the first time since 2004, and re-entered division 1 of the May Bumps in 2024 for the first time since 1998. The women&#x27;s side of the club generally crews one or two boats in the Lent Bumps and two boats in the May Bumps.

In Lent Bumps 2020, Sidney Sussex were the winners of the Marconi Cup, which is awarded to the highest performing of boat club overall. The Women&#x27;s second boat were winners of blades, bumping a total of five times.

=== Confraternitas Historica ===

The &quot;Confraternitas Historica&quot;, or &quot;Confraternitas Historica Dominae Franciscae Comitis Sussexiae&quot;, is the history society of Sidney Sussex College and is reputed to be the longest-running student history society in Europe, having existed since 1910. In fact, no meetings were held from 1914 to 1919 but since, during the First World War, &quot;the University itself almost ceased to function ... the hiatus of 1914–19 is not counted as a break in the continuity of the society&quot;.

The Latin name of the society reflects the tastes of Jack Reynolds, the fellow who presided over its creation, who also &quot;endowed the Society with an elaborate Latin initiation ceremony&quot;. Similarly, rather than being led by a President, the student in charge of the society is instead &#x27;Princeps&#x27;. Other society roles include the &#x27;Magister,&#x27; &#x27;Tribune,&#x27; &#x27;Pontifex Maximus,&#x27; and &#x27;Comes&#x27;. During society meetings all attendees are referred to in an egalitarian, though still Latinate, manner. Regardless of academic standing or title, all attendees are given the title of &#x27;soror&#x27; (sister) or &#x27;frater&#x27; (brother).

=== Sidney Sussex Cricket Club ===
During Lent term, Sidney holds indoor cricket training sessions, while outdoor training and matches, including the renowned inter-collegiate &#x27;Cuppers&#x27; competition, occur in Easter term. Additionally, the college organises social events throughout the academic year.

=== University Challenge ===
Sidney Sussex College has a strong history on the iconic quiz show &quot;University Challenge&quot;, having won the competition in both 1971 and 1978–79. The 1978–79 team, consisting of John Gilmore, John Adams, David Lidington, and Nick Graham, not only won the original series but also claimed victory in the University Challenge Reunited competition in 2002, which brought together past winning teams.

During the University Challenge Reunited competition in 2002, the 1979 team had originally secured a place in the semi-finals as the fourth highest-scoring team, with 275 points, before going on to win the competition. They achieved the following impressive scores to victory:

* First round: Sidney Sussex, 1979: 275 points, Trinity College, Oxford, 1972: 185 points
* Second round: Sidney Sussex, 1979: 390 points, Somerville College, Oxford, 2002: 90 points
* Final: Sidney Sussex, 1979: 375 points, Keele University, 1968: 185 points

David Lidington, who later became a prominent member of Theresa May&#x27;s government, captained the team during the Reunited series. He also featured in a BBC documentary marking 60 years of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, reflecting on the team&#x27;s experiences. Nicholas Graham fondly remembered the 2002 competition, recalling the team&#x27;s initial reservations about returning after so many years but being delighted by their performance.

Sidney Sussex last appeared on &quot;University Challenge&quot; in 2018.

===May Ball===

Sidney&#x27;s first May Ball was in 1894 during Charles Smith&#x27;s Mastership. In 2010, the Venice-themed May Ball garnered national press attention for its unique punting setup. Recent themes have included &#x27;Light&#x27; (2014) and &#x27;Beyond&#x27; (2016). In 2022, an &#x27;Arcade&#x27; theme featured Pacman, the Ghost Gang, and a neon maze in Hall Court, with the Knox-Shaw Room transformed into a retro arcade. 

As with many of the smaller colleges, Sidney Sussex does not run a May Ball every year, instead running a biennial May Ball, on even-numbered years. On odd-numbered years, the college previously hosted an arts festival, which welcomed anyone in Cambridge to attend. Notable guest speakers at the Sidney Arts Festival have included Stephen Fry, in 2015. The college now hosts a June Event on odd-numbered years, which is an event which is shorter, smaller and cheaper to attend than a May Ball.

=== A Song of Sidney Sussex ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Ernest Howard Griffiths, a fellow of Sidney Sussex College in 1897 wrote a ten verse song dedicated to Sidney Sussex. Each verse systematically identifies, then dismisses other Cambridge colleges for their faults, before settling on Sidney as the best college of all. The chorus exhorts the audience:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin:0.3em auto; text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&#x27;Go travel round the town, my friend, whichever way you please,
From Downing up to Trinity, from Peterhouse to Caius:
Then seek a little College just beside a busy street,
Its name is Sidney Sussex, and you&#x27;ll find it Bad to Beat.&#x27;&lt;/poem&gt;

== People associated with Sidney ==

Oliver Cromwell, who matriculated at Sidney Sussex College in 1616, spent his formative years at the college, which was heavily influenced by Puritan thought. His time at Sidney is often cited as instrumental in shaping his religious and political convictions, which later defined his role in the English Civil War and as Lord Protector of England. Though he left before earning a degree, Sidney Sussex College played a notable part in Cromwell&#x27;s ideological development. Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s head was interred in 1960 in a secret location near the antechapel. 

Other former College members include early historian Thomas Fuller; historical writer Thomas Rymer; the 17th-century poet and dramatist Thomas May; and Dean of Sidney Sussex College and later Bishop Robert Machray.

Another famous alumnus was the theologian and moral philosopher William Wollaston who wrote &quot;The Religion of Nature Delineated&quot; (1724). Notable legal alumni include Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (judge on the International Court of Justice from 2009 until his death in 2022).

=== Politicians ===
Notable politicians to have attended the college include the civil servant Sir Basil Engholm; and the former Foreign Secretary and leader of the Social Democratic Party Lord Owen. Former students also include Chris Grayling; David Lidington; Rebecca Evans; Ken Skates, and the late Brian Lenihan, former Minister of Finance in the Republic of Ireland.

=== Bletchley Park codebreakers ===
Eleven members of the college worked at Bletchley Park during World War Two. They were Gordon Welchman, a Sidney Research Fellow in Mathematics who recruited many of them, John Herivel, Asa Briggs, Paul Coales, Malcolm Chamberlain, Edward Dudley Smith, John Manisty, Jim Passant, David Rees, Howard Smith (later head of MI5) and Leslie Yoxall (famous for his work in Hut 8 on breaking the German naval officers&#x27; code).

=== Artists and popular figures ===
Recent alumni of Sidney Sussex College include prominent figures across various fields. Andrew Rawnsley, author, broadcaster, and Associate Editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, is among them, as well as Paddy Lowe, former Technical Director of the Mercedes-Benz Formula One team. Carol Vorderman, television host and mathematician known for her role on &quot;Countdown&quot;, and comedian Alex Horne also studied at Sidney. Additionally, John Madden, the Hollywood director known for the Academy Award-winning &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, and professor and writer John Fraser are distinguished alumni. In the music industry, Al Doyle (1998) and Felix Martin (1999) of the electronic band Hot Chip are notable alumni, and in 2010, the American composer Eric Whitacre was named Visiting Fellow and Composer-in-Residence. 

Lord Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, is one of Sidney Sussex College’s distinguished alumni. As a Crossbench Peer in the House of Lords, Lord Bilimoria has made significant contributions to both the business world and public life. 

Daniel Levy, a Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge alumnus, earned his degree in Economics and Land Economy before embarking on a successful career in business. He has been the chairman of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur since 2001, making him the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League. During his tenure, Levy has overseen significant developments, including the construction of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the club&#x27;s transformation into a global brand. 

=== Sherlock Holmes ===
Author Dorothy L. Sayers suggested that, given details in two of the stories, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes must have been at Cambridge rather than Oxford and that &quot;of all the Cambridge Colleges, Sidney Sussex (College) perhaps offered the greatest number of advantages to a man in Holmes&#x27;s position and, in default of more exact information, we may tentatively place him there&quot;.

<text>The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is a British order of chivalry, rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service outside the civil service. It comprises five classes of awards across both civil and military divisions, the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male or a dame if female. There is also the related British Empire Medal, whose recipients are affiliated with, but not members of, the order.

The order was established on 4 June 1917 by King George V, who created the order to recognise &#x27;such persons, male or female, as may have rendered or shall hereafter render important services to Our Empire&#x27;. Equal recognition was to be given for services rendered in the UK and overseas. Today the majority of recipients are UK citizens, though a number of Commonwealth realms outside the UK continue to make appointments to the order. Honorary awards may be made to citizens of other nations of which the order&#x27;s sovereign is not the head of state.

==Current classes==
The five classes of appointment to the Order are, from highest grade to lowest grade:
# Knight Grand Cross or Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE)
# Knight Commander or Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE or DBE)
# Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE)
# Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE)
# Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE)

The senior two ranks of Knight or Dame Grand Cross and Knight or Dame Commander entitle their members to use the titles Sir for men and Dame for women before their forenames, except with honorary awards.

==History==
King George V founded the order to fill gaps in the British honours system:
* The Orders of the Garter, the Thistle and St Patrick honoured royals, peers, statesmen and eminent military commanders;
* The Order of the Bath honoured senior military officers and civil servants;
* The Order of St Michael and St George honoured diplomats and colonial officials;
* The Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire honoured Indian rulers and British and Indian officials of the British Indian Empire; and
* The Royal Victorian Order, in the personal gift of the monarch, honoured those who had personally served the royal family.

In particular, George V wished to create an order to honour the many thousands of individuals from across the Empire who had served in a variety of non-combat roles during the First World War.

From its foundation the order consisted of five classes (GBE, KBE/DBE, CBE, OBE and MBE) and was open to both women and men; provision was also made for conferring honorary awards on foreign recipients. At the same time, alongside the order, the Medal of the Order of the British Empire was instituted, to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership. The first investiture took place at Ibrox Stadium, as part of a royal visit to the Glasgow shipyards, with the appointment of Alexander Ure, 1st Baron Strathclyde as a GBE (in recognition of his role as chairman of the Scottish War Savings Committee) and the award of medal of the order to Lizzie Robinson, a munitions worker.
The order had been established primarily as a civilian award; in August 1918, however, not long after its foundation, a number of awards were made to serving naval and military personnel. Four months later, a &#x27;Military Division&#x27; was added to the order, to which serving personnel would in future be appointed. The classes were the same as for the Civil Division (as it was now termed), but military awards were distinguished by the addition of a central vertical red stripe to the purple riband of the civil awards. In 1920 appointment as an MBE &#x27;for an act of gallantry&#x27; was granted for the first time, to Sydney Frank Blanck Esq, who had rescued an injured man from a burning building containing explosives.

In December 1922 the statutes of the order were amended; there having been a large number of awards for war work prior to this date, these amended statutes placed the order on more of a peacetime footing. For the first time numbers of appointments were limited, with the stipulation that senior awards in the Civil Division were to outnumber those in the Military Division by a proportion of six to one. Furthermore appointments in the civil division were to be divided equally between UK and overseas awards.

With regard to the Medal of the Order (but not the order itself), a distinction was made in 1922 between awards &#x27;for gallantry&#x27; and awards &#x27;for meritorious service&#x27; (each being appropriately inscribed, and the former having laurel leaves decorating the clasp, the latter oak leaves). In 1933 holders of the medal &#x27;for gallantry&#x27;, which had come to be known as the Empire Gallantry Medal, were given permission to use the postnominal letters EGM (and at the same time to add a laurel branch emblem to the ribbon of the medal); however, in 1940, awards of the EGM ceased and all holders of the medal were instructed to exchange it for a new and more prestigious gallantry award: the George Cross. In 1941, the medal of the order &#x27;for meritorious service&#x27; was renamed the British Empire Medal, and the following year its recipients were granted the right to use the postnominal letters BEM. During the war, the BEM came to be used to recognise acts of bravery which did not merit the award of a George Cross or George Medal, a use which continued until the introduction of the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal in 1974.
The designs of insignia of the order and medal were altered in 1937, prior to the coronation of King George VI, &#x27;in commemoration of the reign of King George V and Queen Mary, during which the Order was founded&#x27;. The figure of Britannia at the centre of the badge of the order was replaced with an image of the crowned heads of the late King and Queen Mary, and the words &#x27;Instituted by King George V&#x27; were added to the reverse of the medal. The colour of the riband was also changed: twenty years earlier, prior to the order&#x27;s establishment, Queen Mary had made it known that pink would be her preferred colour for the riband of the proposed new order, but, in the event, purple was chosen. Following her appointment as Grand Master of the order in 1936 a change was duly made and since 9 March 1937 the riband of the order has been &#x27;rose pink edged with pearl grey’ (with the addition of a vertical pearl grey stripe in the centre for awards in the military division).

From time to time the order was expanded: there was an increase in the maximum permitted number of recipients in 1933, and a further increase in 1937. During the Second World War, as had been the case during and after World War I, the number of military awards was greatly increased; between 1939 and 1946 there were more than 33,000 appointments to the Military Division of the order from the UK and across the Empire. Recommendations for all appointments to the Order of the British Empire were originally made on the nomination of the King&#x27;s United Kingdom ministers (recommendations for overseas awards were made by the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office and the Dominions Office); but in the early 1940s the system was changed to enable the governments of overseas dominions to make their own nominations; Canada and South Africa began doing so in 1942, followed by Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth realms.

In May 1957, forty years after the foundation of the order, it was announced that St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was to serve as the church of the order, and in 1960 a chapel was dedicated for its use within the crypt of the cathedral. That year, Commonwealth awards made up 40% of all OBEs and MBEs awarded (and 35% of all living recipients of the higher awards). Gradually that proportion reduced as independent states within the Commonwealth established their own systems of honours. The last Canadian recommendation for the Order of the British Empire was an MBE for gallantry gazetted in 1966, a year before the creation of the Order of Canada. On the other hand, the Australian Honours System unilaterally created in 1975 did not achieve bi-partisan support until 1992, which was when Australian federal and state governments agreed to cease Australian recommendations for British honours; the last Australian recommended Order of the British Empire appointments were in the 1989 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. New Zealand continued to use the order alongside its own honours until the establishment of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1996. Other Commonwealth realms have continued to use the Order of the British Empire alongside their own honours.

In 1993 the Prime Minister, John Major, instituted a reform of the honours system with the aim &#x27;that exceptional service or achievement will be more widely recognised; that greater importance will be given to voluntary service; that automatic honours will end; that the distinction between ranks in military operational gallantry awards will cease&#x27;. The reforms affected the order at various levels: for example the automatic award each year of a GBE to the Lord Mayor of London ceased; the OBE replaced the Imperial Service Order as an award for civil servants and the number of MBEs awarded each year was significantly increased. As part of these reforms the British Empire Medal stopped being awarded by the United Kingdom; those who would formerly have met the criteria for the medal were instead made eligible for the MBE.

In 2004, a report entitled &quot;A Matter of Honour: Reforming Our Honours System&quot; by a Commons select committee recommended phasing out the Order of the British Empire, as its title was &quot;now considered to be unacceptable, being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country&#x27;s population&quot;. The committee further suggested changing the name of the award to the Order of British Excellence, and changing the rank of Commander to Companion (as the former was said to have a &quot;militaristic ring&quot;), as well as advocating for the abolition of knighthoods and damehoods; the government, however, was not of the opinion that a case for change had been made, and the aforementioned suggestions and recommendations were not, therefore, pursued.

In the 21st century quotas were introduced to ensure consistent representation among recipients across nine categories of eligibility:
* Arts and media
* Community, voluntary and local
* Economy
* Education
* Health
* Parliamentary and political
* Science and technology
* Sport
* State
with the largest proportion of awards being reserved for community, voluntary and local service.
Non-military awards of the British Empire Medal resumed in 2012, starting with 293 BEMs awarded for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

In 2017 the centenary of the order was celebrated with a service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Composition==
The order is limited to 300 Knights and Dames Grand Cross, 845 Knights and Dames Commander, and 8,960 Commanders. There are no limits applied to the total number of members of the fourth and fifth classes, but no more than 858 officers and 1,464 members may be appointed per year. Foreign appointees, as honorary members, do not contribute to the numbers restricted to the order as full members do. Although the Order of the British Empire has by far the highest number of members of the British orders of chivalry, with more than 100,000 living members worldwide, there are fewer appointments to knighthoods than in other orders.

From time to time, individuals may be promoted to a higher grade within the Order, thereby ceasing usage of the junior post-nominal letters.

===Sovereign and Grand Master===
The British sovereign is the sovereign of the order and appoints all other officers of the order (by convention, on the advice of the governments of the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth realms). The second-most senior officer is the Grand Master (a &#x27;Prince of the Blood Royal, or other exalted personage&#x27; appointed by the sovereign, who, by virtue of their appointment, becomes &#x27;the First or Principal Knight Grand Cross of the same Order&#x27;). The position of Grand Master has been held by the following people:

===Officers===
In addition to the sovereign and the grand master, the order has six further officers:

* Prelate: Bishop of London, The Rt Hon. &amp; Rt Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally 
* Dean: Dean of St Paul&#x27;s (), The Very Rev. Andrew Tremlett
* Secretary: Secretary of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Segrave
* Registrar: Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Home Civil Service, Sir Chris Wormald 
* King of Arms: Lieutenant General Sir Simon Mayall 
* Lady Usher of the Purple Rod: Dame Amelia Fawcett 

At its foundation the order was served by three officers: the King of Arms, the Registrar &amp; Secretary and the Gentleman Usher of the Purple Rod. In 1922 the Prelate was added, and the office of Registrar was separated from that of Secretary: the former was to be responsible for recording all proceedings connected with the order, issuing warrants under the seal of the order and making arrangements for investitures, while the latter (at that time the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury) was responsible for collecting and tabulating the names of those who were to receive an award. The office of Dean was added in 1957.

The King of Arms is not a member of the College of Arms, as are many other heraldic officers; and the Lady Usher of the Purple Rod does not – unlike the Order of the Garter equivalent, the Lady Usher of the Black Rod – perform any duties related to the House of Lords.

==Commonwealth awards==

Since the Second World War, several Commonwealth realms have established their own national system of honours and awards and have created their own unique orders, decorations and medals. A number, though, continue to make recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire. In 2024 appointments to the order were made by the governments of: 
* Antigua and Barbuda
* The Bahamas
* Belize
* Cook Islands
* Grenada
* Papua New Guinea
* Saint Christopher and Nevis
* Saint Lucia
* Solomon Islands

== Honorary awards ==
Most members of the order are citizens of the United Kingdom or other Commonwealth realms that use the UK system of honours and awards. In addition, honorary awards may be made to citizens of nations where the monarch is not head of state; these permit use of post-nominal letters, but not the title of &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot;. Honorary appointees who later become a citizen of a Commonwealth realm can convert their appointment from honorary to substantive, and they then enjoy all privileges of membership of the order, including use of the title of &quot;Sir&quot; and &quot;Dame&quot; for the senior two ranks of the Order. (An example of the latter is Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan, who was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order in 2005, and on successful application for British citizenship, held alongside his Irish citizenship, was made a substantive member and subsequently styled as Sir Terry Wogan).

==Gallantry awards==

Although initially intended to recognise meritorious service, the order began to also be awarded for gallantry. There were an increased number of cases in the Second World War for service personnel and civilians including the merchant navy, police, emergency services and civil defence, mostly MBEs but with a small number of OBEs and CBEs. Such awards were for gallantry that did not reach the standard of the George Medal (even though, as appointments to an order of chivalry, they were listed before it on the Order of Wear. In contrast to awards for meritorious service, which usually appear without a citation, there were often citations for gallantry awards, some detailed and graphic. From 14 January 1958, these awards were designated Commander, Officer or Member of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry.

Any individual made a member of the order for gallantry after 14 January 1958 wears an emblem of two crossed silver oak leaves on the same ribbon as the badge, with a miniature version on the ribbon bar when worn alone. When the ribbon only is worn the emblem is worn in miniature. It could not be awarded posthumously, and was replaced in 1974 with the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal (QGM). If recipients of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry received promotion within the order, whether for gallantry or otherwise, they continued to wear also the insignia of the lower grade with the oak leaves; however, they used only the post-nominal letters of the higher grade.

==Insignia==

When the order was founded in 1917, badges, ribands and stars were appointed for wear by recipients. In 1929 mantles, hats and collars were added for recipients of the highest class of the order (GBE). The designs of all these items underwent major changes in 1937.

===Badge===
The badge is worn by all members of the order; the size, colour and design depends on the class of award. The badge for all classes is in the form of a &quot;cross &quot; (having the arms growing broader and floriated toward the end) with a medallion in the centre, the obverse of which bears a crowned image of George V and Queen Mary within a circlet bearing the motto of the Order; the reverse bears George V&#x27;s Royal and Imperial Cypher. (Prior to 1937 Britannia was shown within the circlet.) The size of the badges varies according to rank: the higher classes have slightly larger badges. The badges of Knights and Dames Grand Cross, Knights and Dames Commander, and Commanders are enamelled, with pale blue crosses, crimson circlets and a gold central medallion. Officers&#x27; badges are plain silver-gilt, while those of Members are plain silver.

===Riband===
From 1917 until 1937, the badge of the order was suspended on a purple ribbon, with a red central stripe being added for the military division in 1918. Since 1937, the ribbon has been rose-pink with pearl-grey edges (with the addition of a pearl-grey central stripe for the military division). Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear it on a broad riband or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip. Knights Commander and male Commanders wear the badge from a ribbon around the neck; male Officers and Members wear the badge from a ribbon on the left chest; female recipients other than Dames Grand Cross (unless in military uniform) normally wear it from a bow on the left shoulder.

===Star===
An oval eight-pointed star is worn, pinned to the left breast, by Knights and Dames Grand Cross; Knights and Dames Commander wear a smaller star composed of &#x27;four equal points and four lesser&#x27;. The star is not worn by the more junior classes. Prior to 1937 each star had in the centre a gold medallion with a figure of Britannia, surrounded by a crimson circlet inscribed with the motto of the order (&#x27;For God and the Empire&#x27;); since 1937 the effigies of King George V and Queen Mary have been shown within the circlet.

===Mantles and collars===
In 1929, to bring the order into line with the other orders of chivalry, members of the first class of the order (GBE) were provided with mantles, hats and collars. 
* The &quot;mantle&quot; is a cloak-like garment of rose pink satin lined with pearl-grey silk (prior to 1937 it was of purple satin). On the left side is a representation of the star of the order (as pictured below).
* Initially a purple plumed hat was also provided to be worn with the mantle; in 1937 the colour of the hat was changed to black.
* The &quot;collar&quot; is made of gold. It consists of six medallions depicting the Royal Arms, alternating with six medallions depicting the Royal and Imperial Cypher of George V (&quot;GRI&quot;, which stands for &quot;&quot;). The medallions are linked with gold cables depicting &#x27;sea-lions&#x27; and crowns. When collars are worn the badge is suspended from the collar.

Only Knights/Dames Grand Cross wear these elaborate vestments; the hat is now rarely, if ever, worn. Use of the mantle is limited to important occasions (such as quadrennial services and coronations). The mantle is always worn with the collar. Although the mantle was introduced in 1929, very few mantles would have been produced prior to the 1937 design changes, as there were few occasions for wearing them in the intervening years.

On certain days designated by the sovereign, known as &quot;collar days&quot;, members attending formal events may wear the order&#x27;s collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, evening wear or robes of office.

Collars are returned upon the death of their owners, but other insignia may be retained.

The six office-holders of the order wear pearl-grey mantles lined with rose-pink, having on the right side a purple shield charged with the roundel from the badge. Each of these office-holders wears a unique badge of office, suspended from a gold chain worn around the neck.

The &quot;British Empire Medal&quot; is made of silver. On the obverse is an image of Britannia surrounded by the motto, with the words &quot;For Meritorious Service&quot; at the bottom; on the reverse is George V&#x27;s Imperial and Royal Cypher, with the words &quot;Instituted by King George V&quot; at the bottom. The name of the recipient is engraved on the rim. It comes in both full-sized and miniature versions – the latter for formal white-tie and semi-formal black-tie occasions.

A lapel pin for everyday wear was first announced at the end of December 2006, and is available to recipients of all levels of the order, as well as to holders of the British Empire Medal. The pin design is not unique to any level. The pin features the badge of the order, enclosed in a circle of ribbon of its colours of pink and grey. Lapel pins must be purchased separately by a member of the order. The creation of such a pin was recommended in Sir Hayden Phillips&#x27; review of the honours system in 2004.

==Chapel==

The Chapel of the Order of the British Empire is in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. It occupies the far eastern end of the cathedral crypt and was dedicated in 1960. The only heraldic banners normally on display in the chapel are those of the &quot;Sovereign of the Order of the British Empire&quot; and of the &quot;Grand Master of the Order of the British Empire&quot;. Rather than using this chapel, the Order now holds its great services upstairs in the nave of the cathedral. In addition to the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral also houses the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George. Religious services for the whole Order are held every four years; new Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed at these services.

==Precedence and privileges==
Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander prefix &quot;Sir&quot;, and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commander prefix &quot;Dame&quot;, to their forenames. Wives of Knights may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames, but no equivalent privilege exists for husbands of Knights or spouses of Dames. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms. Male clergy of the Church of England or the Church of Scotland do not use the title &quot;Sir&quot; (unless they were knighted before being ordained) as they do not receive the accolade (they are not dubbed &quot;knight&quot; with a sword), although they do append the post-nominal letters; dames do not receive the accolade, and therefore female clergy are free to use the title &quot;Dame&quot;.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post-nominal GBE; Knights Commander, KBE; Dames Commander, DBE; Commanders, CBE; Officers, OBE; and Members, MBE. The post-nominal for the British Empire Medal is BEM.

Members of all classes of the order are assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of male members of all classes also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander; relatives of Ladies of the Order, however, are not assigned any special precedence. As a general rule, only wives and children of male recipients are afforded privileges.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to be granted heraldic supporters. They may, furthermore, encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights and Dames Commander and Commanders may display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.

== Forfeiture ==
Only the monarch can annul an honour, based on recommendations from the Honours Forfeiture Committee, which considers cases such as criminal convictions or actions that bring the honours system into disrepute. An individual can symbolically renounce their honour by returning the insignia to Buckingham Palace and ceasing to reference their title. However, the honour remains officially held unless formally annulled by the monarch.

For instance, John Lennon returned his MBE insignia in 1969 as a form of protest, but the honour was not formally annulled and remained officially in place.

==People who declined Order of the British Empire honours==

In 2003, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published a list of the people who had rejected the Order of the British Empire, including David Bowie, John Cleese, Nigella Lawson, Elgar Howarth, L. S. Lowry, George Melly, and J. G. Ballard. In addition, Ballard voiced his opposition to the honours system, calling it &quot;a preposterous charade&quot;.

The order has attracted some criticism for its naming having connection with the idea of the now-extinct British Empire. Benjamin Zephaniah, a British poet of Jamaican and Barbadian descent, publicly rejected appointment as an Officer in 2003 because, he asserted, it reminded him of &quot;thousands of years of brutality&quot;. He also said that &quot;it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised&quot;.

The author C. S. Lewis (1898–1963) was named on the last list of honours by George VI in December 1951. Despite being a monarchist, he declined so as to avoid association with any political issues.

In 2019, comedian John Oliver turned down an offer of an OBE, which would have been part of the Queen&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Honours list.

The Beatles were appointed Members in 1965: John Lennon justified his investiture by comparing military membership in the Order: &quot;Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE [status] received theirs for heroism in the war – for killing people ... We received ours for entertaining other people. I&#x27;d say we deserve ours more&quot;. Lennon later returned his MBE insignia on 25 November 1969, as part of his ongoing peace protests. 

Other criticism centres on the view that many recipients of the Order are being rewarded with honours for simply doing their jobs; critics say that the Civil Service and Judiciary receive far more orders and honours than leaders of other professions.

Chin Peng, a veteran guerrilla fighter of the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army, was appointed as an Officer for his role in fighting against the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II, in close co-operation with the British commando Force 136. Several years after the war, his OBE membership was withdrawn by the British government (and became undesirable to Chin Peng himself) when the Communist leader headed his party&#x27;s guerrilla insurgency against the British Empire during the Malayan Emergency.

<doc id="212186" wikidata="Q1296901" url="?curid=212186" title="Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople">
<text>The Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople was an office established as a result of the Fourth Crusade and its conquest of Constantinople in 1204. It was a Roman Catholic replacement for the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and remained in the city until the reconquest of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261, whereupon it became a titular see. The office was abolished in 1964.

==History==
In the early middle ages, there were five patriarchs in the Christian world. In descending order of precedence: Rome by the Bishop of Rome (who rarely used the title &quot;Patriarch&quot;) and those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.

The sees of Rome and Constantinople were often at odds with one another, just as the Greek and Latin Churches as a whole were often at odds both politically and in things ecclesiastical. There were complex cultural currents underlying these difficulties. The tensions led in 1054 to a serious rupture between the Greek East and Latin West called the East–West Schism, which while not in many places absolute, still dominates the ecclesiastical landscape.

In 1204, the Fourth Crusade invaded, seized and sacked Constantinople, and established the Latin Empire. Pope Innocent III, who was not involved, initially spoke out against the Crusade, writing in a letter to his legate, &quot;How, indeed, is the Greek church to be brought back into ecclesiastical union and to a devotion for the Apostolic See when she has been beset with so many afflictions and persecutions that she sees in the Latins only an example of perdition and the works of darkness, so that she now, and with reason, detests the Latins more than dogs?&quot; However the popes accepted the Latin patriarchate established by Catholic clergy that accompanied the Crusade, similar to Latin patriarchates previously established in the Crusader states of the Holy Land. The pope recognised these &quot;Latin&quot; sees at the Fourth Council of the Lateran. Furthermore, those Orthodox bishops left in their place were made to swear an oath of allegiance to the pope.

However, the Latin Empire in Constantinople was eventually defeated and dispossessed by a resurgent Byzantium in 1261. Since that time Latin Patriarch Pantaleonе Giustinian (d. 1286) resided in the West, though continuing to oversee the remaining Latin Catholic dioceses in various parts of Latin Greece. The continuing threat of a Catholic Crusade to restore the Latin Empire, championed by the ambitious Charles I of Anjou, led to the first attempts, on the Byzantine side, to effect a Union of the Churches. After the Union of Lyon (1274), John Bekkos was installed as a Greek Catholic Patriarch of Constantinople in 1275, but that did not affect the position of Pantaleonе Giustinian. His Greek Catholic counterpart was deposed in 1282 by Eastern Orthodox hierarchy, thus ending a short-lived union. in 1286, Latin Patriarch Pantaleonе Giustinian was succeeded by Pietro Correr who was the first holder of that office in a new form of a titular see.

On 8 February 1314, Pope Clement V united the Patriarchate with the episcopal see of Negroponte (Chalcis), hitherto a suffragan of the Latin Archbishopric of Athens, so that the patriarchs could once more have a territorial diocese on Greek soil and exercise a direct role as the head of the Latin clergy in what remained of Latin Greece.

For a time, like many ecclesiastical offices in the West, it had rival contenders who were supporters or protégés of the rival popes. As to the title Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, this was the case at least from 1378 to 1423. Thereafter the office continued as an honorific title, during the later centuries attributed to a leading clergyman in Rome, until it ceased to be assigned after 1948 and in January 1964, along with the titles of the Latin Patriarchate of Alexandria and Antioch, it was no longer mentioned in the Vatican yearbook (rather than being announced as being abolished). This was after Pope Paul VI met with Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople (see Pope Paul VI and ecumenism), showing the Latin Church by this point was more interested in reconciliation with the Eastern Church, abolishing the titular title.

A Vicariate Apostolic of Istanbul (until 1990, Constantinople) has existed from 1742 into the present day.

<doc id="212187" wikidata="Q215215" url="?curid=212187" title="John Mayer">
<text>John Clayton Mayer ( ; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but he left for Atlanta in 1997 with fellow guitarist Clay Cook, with whom he formed the short-lived rock duo Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play at local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a minor following. He performed at the 2000 South by Southwest festival, and was subsequently signed by Aware Records, an imprint of Columbia Records through which he released his debut extended play (EP), &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot; (1999). His first two studio albums—&quot;Room for Squares&quot; (2001) and &quot;Heavier Things&quot; (2003)—were both met with critical and commercial success; the former spawned the single &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;, which won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, while the latter peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and further delved into the blues and rock music that had originally influenced him. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released the live album &quot;Try!&quot; (2005) and his third studio album, &quot;Continuum&quot; (2006). Both were met with positive critical reception, while the latter was nominated for Album of the Year, and won both Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for its single &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. It was followed by &quot;Battle Studies&quot; (2009), which marked his return to pop.

After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon for the sound of his fifth studio album, &quot;Born and Raised&quot; (2012). Discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel its accompanying tour. Despite favorable reception and becoming his second release to peak atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer recovered in January 2013 and released his sixth studio album, &quot;Paradise Valley&quot; in August of that year, which peaked at number two on the chart and incorporated country, folk, and Americana influences. His seventh album, &quot;The Search for Everything&quot; (2017) was a loose concept based around themes of a romantic break-up. His eighth, &quot;Sob Rock&quot; (2021) was inspired by 1980s soft rock music.

In 2015, three former members of the Grateful Dead joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band Dead &amp; Company. It was the latest of several reunions of the band&#x27;s surviving members since Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death in 1995. Mayer&#x27;s secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing; he has authored columns for magazines such as &quot;Esquire&quot;. He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection he values in the &quot;tens of millions&quot; of dollars), contributing to the watch site &quot;Hodinkee&quot;, has been on the jury at the &quot;Grand Prix d&#x27;Horlogerie de Genève&quot;, and was appointed as the Creative Conduit of Audemars Piguet in 2024. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.

==Early life==
Mayer was born on October 16, 1977, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His father, Richard Mayer (b. 1927), was principal at Central High School in Bridgeport, and his mother, Margaret (&quot;née&quot; Hoffman; b. 1947), was a middle-school English teacher. He grew up in nearby Fairfield, the middle child between older half-sister Rachel, older brother Carl, and younger brother Ben. His father is Jewish, and Mayer has said that he &quot;relates&quot; to Judaism. As an elementary school student, Mayer became close friends with future tennis star James Blake, and they played Nintendo together weekday afternoons after school for three years. He attended the Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk for his junior year (then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad, a magnet program for learning Japanese).

After watching Michael J. Fox&#x27;s guitar performance as Marty McFly in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Mayer became fascinated with the instrument. When he turned 13 years old, his father rented one for him. A neighbor gave Mayer a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette, which cultivated Mayer&#x27;s love of blues music. According to Mayer, his fascination with Vaughan started a &quot;genealogical hunt&quot; that led him to other blues guitarists, including Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert King, Otis Rush, and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins. Mayer started taking lessons from a local guitar shop owner, Al Ferrante, and soon became consumed. His singular focus concerned his parents, and they twice took him to see a psychiatrist, who determined him to be healthy. Mayer says that his parents&#x27; contentious marriage led him to &quot;disappear and create my own world I could believe in&quot;. After two years of practice, he started playing at bars and other venues, while still in high school. In addition to performing solo, he was a member of a band called Villanova Junction (named for a Jimi Hendrix song) with Tim Procaccini, Joe Beleznay, and Rich Wolf.

When Mayer was 17, he was stricken with cardiac dysrhythmia and was hospitalized for a weekend. Reflecting on the incident, Mayer said, &quot;That was the moment the songwriter in me was born&quot;, and he penned his first lyrics the night he left the hospital. Shortly thereafter, he began suffering from panic attacks, and says he feared having to enter a mental institution. He continues to manage such episodes with anti-anxiety medication.

==Career==

===Early career (1996–1999)===

Mayer considered skipping college to pursue music, but his parents dissuaded him. He enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in 1997 at age 19. At the urging of his college friend Clay Cook, they left Berklee after two semesters and moved to Atlanta; there, they formed a two-man band called LoFi Masters, and began performing in local coffee houses and club venues such as Eddie&#x27;s Attic. According to Cook, they experienced musical differences due to Mayer&#x27;s desire to move more towards pop music. The two parted ways and Mayer embarked on a solo career.

With the help of local producer and engineer Glenn Matullo, Mayer recorded the independent EP &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;. The EP includes eight songs with Mayer on lead vocals and guitars. For the opening track, &quot;Back To You&quot;, a full band was enlisted, including the EP&#x27;s co-producer David &quot;DeLa&quot; LaBruyere on bass guitars. Cook had co-written many of the album&#x27;s songs, including its first commercial single release, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;; however, his only performance contribution was backing vocals on the song &quot;Comfortable&quot;.

===Major label and commercial success (2000–2004)===
Mayer and LaBruyere performed throughout Georgia and nearby states. Also, as his career coincided with the then-nascent internet music market, Mayer benefited from an online following. Mayer came to the attention of Gregg Latterman at Aware Records through an acquaintance of Mayer&#x27;s, a lawyer, who sent Aware his EP. In early 2001, after including him in Aware Festival concerts and his songs on Aware compilations, Aware released Mayer&#x27;s internet-only album, &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. During this time, Aware concluded a deal with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first pick in signing Aware artists. In September, Columbia remixed and re-released &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. As part of the major label &quot;debut&quot;, the album&#x27;s artwork was updated, and the track &quot;3x5&quot; was added. The re-release included reworked studio versions of the first four songs from &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;.

By the end of 2002, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; had spawned several radio hits, including &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;Why Georgia&quot;. It also received general praise critically, and Mayer drew comparisons to Dave Matthews. In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;. In his acceptance speech he remarked, &quot;This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up.&quot; He also figuratively referred to himself as being 16, a remark that many mistook to mean that he was 16 years old at the time.

In February 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in Birmingham, Alabama titled &quot;Any Given Thursday&quot;, which included songs previously not recorded, such as &quot;Man on the Side&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Missing&quot;, and &quot;Covered in Rain&quot;. Commercially, the album peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Its accompanying DVD release received conservative—although consistent—praise, with critics torn between his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford of AllMusic asked, &quot;Is [Mayer] the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s &#x27;Lenny&#x27;, or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays &#x27;Your Body Is a Wonderland&#x27;?&quot; That summer, Mayer went on the road with Counting Crows in a tour that spanned 42 dates between July 7 and September 2.

&quot;Heavier Things&quot;, Mayer&#x27;s second album, was released in 2003 to generally favorable reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone, Allmusic,&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot; all gave positive, although reserved, feedback. The album was commercially successful, and while it did not sell as well as &quot;Room for Squares&quot;, it peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The song &quot;Daughters&quot; won the 2005 Grammy for Song of the Year, and reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Pop Songs chart and #19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He dedicated the award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who had died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. On February 9, 2009, Mayer told Ellen DeGeneres that he thought he should not have won the Grammy for Song of the year because he thought that Alicia Keys&#x27; &quot;If I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot; was the better song. Because of this, he removed the top half of the Grammy and gave it to Keys, and kept the bottom part for himself. At the 37th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 2006, Mayer received the Hal David Starlight Award.

Mayer again recorded live concerts across seven nights of his U.S. tour in 2004. These recordings were released to the iTunes Store under the title &quot;As/Is&quot;, indicating that the errors were included along with the good moments. A few months later, a &quot;best of&quot; CD was compiled from the &quot;As/Is&quot; nights. The album included a previously unreleased cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s song &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot;, featuring a solo from Mayer&#x27;s supporting act—jazz and blues turntablist DJ Logic. The album covers of the &quot;As/Is&quot; releases feature drawings of anthropomorphic bunnies.

===Change in musical direction (2005–2008)===

As early as 2002, Chris Willman with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that Mayer was &quot;more historically savvy, and more ambitious than you&#x27;d guess from the unforced earnestness of &quot;[Room for] Squares&quot;. However, Mayer was largely associated with the Adult Contemporary and singer-songwriter genres. Fame allowed him access to his early influences, and he began collaborating with blues and jazz artists. He accompanied Buddy Guy in a concert at the Irving Plaza in December 2003. He toured with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, including a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. He also performed on commercial releases, namely, with Eric Clapton (&quot;Back Home&quot;, Crossroads Guitar Festival), Buddy Guy (&quot;Bring &#x27;Em In)&quot;, John Scofield (&quot;That&#x27;s What I Say&quot;), and B.B. King (&quot;80&quot;). Although Mayer maintained his reputation as a singer-songwriter, he gained distinction as a guitarist.

Following the conclusion of his &quot;Heavier Things&quot; tour, Mayer began working with artists, including those from other genres of music. His voice was sampled on the song &quot;Go&quot; by rapper Common, and he appeared on a hidden track called &quot;Bittersweet Poetry&quot; from the Kanye West album &quot;Graduation&quot;. The collaborations drew praise from rap heavyweights Jay-Z and Nelly. When asked about his presence in the hip hop community, Mayer said, &quot;It&#x27;s not music out there right now. That&#x27;s why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be.&quot;

Around this time Mayer announced that he was &quot;closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity&quot;. In the spring of 2005, Mayer formed the John Mayer Trio with bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan, both of whom he had met through studio sessions. The trio combined blues and rock music. In October 2005, they opened for the Rolling Stones and that November released a live album called &quot;Try!&quot; The band took a break in mid-2006.
Mayer&#x27;s third studio album, titled &quot;Continuum&quot;, was released on September 12, 2006, produced by Mayer and Steve Jordan. Mayer suggested the album was intended to combine blues and pop. In that vein, two of the tracks from his Trio release &quot;Try!&quot;—&quot;Vultures&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;—were included on &quot;Continuum&quot;. Despite his excitement, in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Mayer recalled that after former Columbia Records head Don Ienner panned &quot;Continuum&quot; he briefly considered quitting music and studying design full-time.

In May 2006, Mayer contributed a cover of the song &quot;Route 66&quot; for the Pixar animated film &quot;Cars&quot; (2006). Mayer&#x27;s rendition garnered a 
nomination at the 49th Grammy Awards for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.

The first single from &quot;Continuum&quot; was &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot;, which debuted on &quot;The Ron and Fez Show&quot;. The song was the third-most downloaded song of the week on the iTunes Store following its release on July 11, 2006, and debuted at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart. On August 23, 2006, Mayer debuted the entire album on the Los Angeles radio station Star 98.7, offering commentary on each track. A subsequent version was released the next day on the Clear Channel Music website as a streaming sneak preview. On September 21, 2006, Mayer appeared on &quot;&quot; in the episode &quot;Built to Kill, Part 1&quot;, playing &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; and &quot;Slow Dancing in a Burning Room&quot;. The song &quot;Gravity&quot; was featured on the television series &quot;House&quot;, in the episode &quot;Cane &amp; Able&quot; and &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. He recorded a session for the British program &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot; at Abbey Road Studios on October 22, 2006.

On December 7, 2006, Mayer was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The Trio received a nomination for &quot;Try!&quot;. He won two: Best Pop Song with Vocal for &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; and Best Pop Album for &quot;Continuum&quot;. Mayer remixed an acoustic version of his single &quot;Waiting on the World to Change&quot; with vocal additions from fellow musician Ben Harper. In preparation for &quot;Continuum&quot;, Mayer had booked the Village Recorder in Los Angeles to record five acoustic versions of his songs with veteran musician Robbie McIntosh. These recordings became &quot;The Village Sessions&quot;, an EP released on December 12, 2006. As usual, Mayer oversaw the artwork. The initial North American &quot;Continuum&quot; tour ended on February 28, 2007, with a show at Madison Square Garden.

On November 20, 2007, the re-issue of &quot;Continuum&quot; became available online and in stores. The release contained a bonus disc of six live songs from his 2007 tour: five from &quot;Continuum&quot; and a cover of the Ray Charles song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need No Doctor&quot;. His single &quot;Say&quot;, from the film &quot;The&quot; &quot;Bucket List,&quot; became available through iTunes. On December 6, 2007, &quot;Belief&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. He accompanied Alicia Keys on guitar on her song &quot;No One&quot; at the ceremony. Additionally, he was selected by the editors of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2007, listed among artists and entertainers.

In February 2008, Mayer hosted a three-day Caribbean cruise event that included performances with various musicians including David Ryan Harris, Brett Dennen, Colbie Caillat, and Dave Barnes, among others. The event was called &quot;The Mayercraft Carrier&quot; and was held aboard the cruise ship known as the &quot;Carnival Victory&quot;. A follow-up cruise titled &quot;Mayercraft Carrier 2&quot; sailed from Los Angeles March 27–31, 2009, on the Carnival Splendor.

On July 1, 2008, Mayer released &quot;Where the Light Is&quot;, a live concert film of Mayer&#x27;s performance at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live on December 8, 2007. The film was directed by Danny Clinch. It features Mayer opening with an acoustic set, followed by a blues set with the Trio and concluded by a full set with the band from the &quot;Continuum&quot; album.

===&quot;Battle Studies&quot; (2009)===

Australian artist Guy Sebastian invited Mayer to collaborate on three songs from his 2009 album &quot;Like It Like That&quot;. Mayer also played guitar on the title track of Crosby Loggins&#x27; debut LP, &quot;Time to Move&quot;.

On July 7, 2009, Mayer performed an instrumental guitar version of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Human Nature&quot; at Jackson&#x27;s televised memorial service. He co-wrote &quot;World of Chances&quot; with Demi Lovato for Lovato&#x27;s second album &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;, released later that month.

After the overwhelming success of &quot;Continuum&quot;, Mayer confessed to be intimidated with beginning on a follow-up. However, he stated, &quot;I think it got a lot easier when I realized that no matter what I do, it&#x27;s not going to be &quot;Continuum&quot;, good or bad.&quot; On November 17, 2009, Mayer&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Battle Studies&quot;, debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The first single, &quot;Who Says&quot;, was released on September 24, 2009, in advance of the album, followed on October 19 by &quot;Heartbreak Warfare&quot; and &quot;Half of My Heart&quot; on June 21, 2010. The accompanying arena tour grossed 45 million. Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, critics reactions were mixed. Some reviews glowed, calling it his &quot;most adventurous&quot;, others called the album &quot;safe&quot; and noted that &quot;Mayer the singer-songwriter and Mayer the man about town sometimes seem disconnected, like they don&#x27;t even belong in the same body&quot;. Mayer admitted to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he thought &quot;Battle Studies&quot; was not his best album.

===Personal troubles and hiatus (2010–2013)===
 Following two revealing and highly controversial magazine interviews in February 2010 with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines, Mayer withdrew from public life and ceased giving interviews. While still on tour for &quot;Battle Studies&quot;, he began work in earnest on his fifth studio album—which drew on the popular music of Laurel Canyon in the early 1970s. Around this time, he began to experience vocal problems, and sought medical assistance. On September 16, 2011, he posted on his blog that his next record, &quot;Born and Raised,&quot; would be delayed due to treatment he was receiving for a granuloma discovered on his vocal cords. Mayer described the event as a &quot;temporary setback&quot; and added that the album was entirely finished except for a few vocal tracks. A month later, on October 20, 2011, Mayer posted, &quot;I had surgery this afternoon to remove it and am now on complete vocal rest for a month or more,&quot; during which he planned to &quot;travel the country, look, and listen&quot;. However, the surgery did not work as expected, and he had to undergo another one that August. During his travels, he visited and fell in love with Bozeman, Montana, where he bought a house and re-settled in the spring of 2012.
With his treatments complete, Mayer finished the vocals on &quot;Born and Raised&quot;, and the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Shadow Days&quot;, was released on February 27, 2012. The following day, he released the track listing for the album, announcing that it would be released on May 22 of that year. He described it as his &quot;most honest&quot; album, and begin booking dates at more &quot;intimate&quot; venues than for &quot;Battle Studies&quot;. He also accepted an invitation to appear at the South by Southwest festival. However, the granuloma returned, and on March 9, 2012, Mayer announced that he had been forced to cancel his tour and refrain from all singing indefinitely. Even so, &quot;Born and Raised&quot; was released as scheduled, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number one, selling 219,000 copies in its first week. It also received generally positive critical feedback; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it number 17 on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 2012, and &quot;People&quot; magazine called it &quot;a shimmering album&quot;. Meanwhile, Mayer brought a new focus to his guitar playing and, fearing that his vocal cords had been permanently damaged, tried to come to terms with a possible future as a session musician. Determined to be cured, he sought help from the UCLA Voice Center. That September, otolaryngologist Dr. Gerald Berke paralyzed Mayer&#x27;s vocal cords with a series of high-dose Botox injections, hoping that they would allow the granuloma to heal. Mayer&#x27;s vocal rest extended to several months and, unable to even talk, his performances were limited to accompanying other artists on guitar. He appeared in September 2012 on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he joined musical guest Frank Ocean. He played with the Rolling Stones in New Jersey in December 2012.

By January 2013, Mayer had recovered sufficiently enough to perform at a benefit concert in Bozeman, after almost two years without singing publicly. In April 2013, he made an appearance at the Crossroads Guitar Festival, and at the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, where he inducted the late Albert King. A show at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater in Alabama on April 25, 2013, followed by a set at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival the next day, marked his first full-length concerts since his health troubles.

===&quot;Paradise Valley&quot;, Dead &amp; Company, &quot;The Search for Everything&quot; (2013–2018)===
In June 2013, Mayer announced that he was finishing work on his sixth album, &quot;Paradise Valley.&quot; Produced by Don Was, the album features &quot;low-key folk-rock tunes&quot;. He collaborated with Frank Ocean on the song &quot;Wildfire Pt. 2&quot;, and with Katy Perry on &quot;Who You Love&quot;. The latter song would go on to become the album&#x27;s third single, and an accompanying music video was released on December 17. On June 18, 2013, he released a lyric video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Paper Doll&quot;, on his official YouTube page. The album was released August 20, 2013, and—meeting with positive reviews—debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 145,560 copies in the United States. Mayer embarked on a tour, his first in three years, in support of &quot;Born and Raised&quot; and &quot;Paradise Valley&quot;. The American leg of the tour ran from July to December 2013 with Interscope recording artist Phillip Phillips serving as the supporting act. The tour visited Australia in April 2014.

During a concert in Adelaide, Mayer covered the Beyoncé song &quot;XO&quot; . One month later, on May 22, he released a studio version of the song on his SoundCloud account. It was made available for digital download by Columbia Records on May 27, 2014, through the iTunes Store. For the week ending June 1, 2014, Mayer&#x27;s version debuted at number 90 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 13 on the US Hot Rock Songs chart. On the Canadian Hot 100, &quot;XO&quot; peaked at a position of 76. The single also peaked at number 81 on the Australian Singles Chart (its debut week), and at number 95 on the Dutch Singles Chart. In the UK, it peaked at 115 on the UK Singles Chart. Mayer recorded the song &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; as a duet with Barbra Streisand for her album &quot;Partners&quot;, released in September 2014.

In February 2015, Mayer performed alongside Ed Sheeran at the Grammy Awards. As of March, Mayer said he was taking break from working on a &quot;deeply personal new album&quot;. Mayer also recounted that in 2011 he happened upon a song by the Grateful Dead while listening to Pandora, and that soon the band&#x27;s music was all he would listen to. In February 2015, while guest hosting &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Mayer invited Grateful Dead guitar player Bob Weir to join him in a studio performance. While Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann (surviving members of the Grateful Dead) were preparing for their Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead tour with Trey Anastasio, Mayer began practicing the band&#x27;s catalog of songs. That August, Mayer, Weir, Kreutzmann, and Hart formed the group Dead &amp; Company, along with Jeff Chimenti and Oteil Burbridge, and began a fall tour in the United States. The tour was well received (&quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;magical&quot;), and they continued to tour the US into 2016. Although Lesh has declined to join Dead &amp; Company, Mayer also performed with Phil Lesh and Friends at Terrapin Crossroads in 2015.

As a result of his touring with Dead &amp; Company, Mayer postponed working on his next studio album until January 2016, with plans to finish it by the end of the year. On November 17, 2016, Mayer released &quot;Love on the Weekend&quot; as the lead single from his EP &quot;The Search for Everything: Wave One&quot;, which was then released on January 20, 2017. A second EP, &quot;The Search for Everything: Wave Two&quot;, was released on February 24, 2017, along with the single &quot;Still Feel Like Your Man&quot;. The album &quot;The Search for Everything&quot; was released on April 14, 2017, and was promoted by a third single titled &quot;In the Blood&quot;, released on May 1, 2017, and by The Search for Everything World Tour from March to October of the same year.

Mayer also continued touring with Dead &amp; Company during the summer and fall of 2017. On December 5, during the Fall Tour, his appendix burst, resulting in an emergency appendectomy and the postponement of the remaining tour dates to February 2018. In January 2018, Dead &amp; Company announced their Dead &amp; Company Summer Tour 2018.

=== &quot;Sob Rock&quot; (2018–present) ===

On May 10, 2018, Mayer released the single &quot;New Light&quot;, co-produced by No I.D. and Mayer himself. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music on the release day, he announced &quot;more new music&quot; for 2018. During his performance at the iHeartRadio Theater on October 24, 2018, he premiered a song titled &quot;I Guess I Just Feel Like&quot;. On December 12, 2018, he announced a world tour for 2019. Mayer released two singles in 2019; the previously played &quot;I Guess I Just Feel Like&quot; on February 22, and &quot;Carry Me Away&quot; on September 6.

During an episode of John Mayer&#x27;s show &quot;Current Mood&quot; on March 15, 2020, he revealed that he was in the process of writing and recording songs for a new album. In early 2021, he stated that the album was completely finished as he began posting snippets of new songs on TikTok ahead of release. In an interview with Kerwin Frost, Mayer hinted at an April release for the album. Later, the date was pushed back. On June 1, 2021, Mayer officially announced his eighth album &quot;Sob Rock&quot; and on June 4, released the lead single, &quot;Last Train Home&quot; along with an accompanying music video. The album was released on July 16, 2021, as well as a music video for the song, &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;. The track list included previously released singles &quot;New Light&quot;, &quot;I Guess I Just Feel Like&quot; and &quot;Carry Me Away&quot;. &quot;Carry Me Away&quot; was slightly reworked production-wise to fit the album&#x27;s 1980s aesthetic.

== Touring ==
Mayer began touring as a solo artist in 2001. While his early records were largely acoustic, early reviewers noted his unexpected electric &quot;guitar heroics&quot; during live performances.

Mayer has toured North America, Europe and Australia with many musical groups, including Maroon 5,Counting Crows, Ben Folds, the Wallflowers, Sheryl Crow, Colbie Caillat and Train. In 2010, Mayer and Keith Urban performed at a CMT Crossroads concert a medley of their songs and a rendition of George Michael&#x27;s single &quot;Faith&quot;. This performance led to Urban and Mayer teaming up again for future performances, including at the 2010 CMT Music Awards.

Mayer allows audio taping and non-commercial trading of those recordings at most of his live performances. Mayer often shows up at small venues unannounced (or with little advance notice) for surprise concerts—occasionally for free or without accepting the performance fee. He has made appearances throughout the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and New York areas, including shows at the Laugh Factory, Eddie&#x27;s Attic, and the Village Underground. After a public campaign by their senior class president, Mayer performed a surprise three-song set at the 2004 Pennsbury High School senior prom. In June 2015, Mayer appeared as a guest for two nights with Phil Lesh and Friends at Terrapin Crossroads, recreating the Grateful Dead&#x27;s notable May 8 and June 9, 1977, concerts.

==Other ventures==
===Dead &amp; Company===

Since 2015, Mayer has been touring with Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead. Founding bassist Phil Lesh has notably declined to participate in the project, although he has performed with Mayer on a few occasions since Dead &amp; Company began. The role of bassist in Dead &amp; Company has instead been played by Oteil Burbridge of the Allman Brothers Band. Jeff Chimenti, who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group&#x27;s keyboardist. 
Although Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song &quot;Althea&quot; by chance on Pandora radio. In 2015, while the Dead&#x27;s &quot;Fare Thee Well&quot; shows with Trey Anastasio were also being planned, Mayer performed &quot;Althea&quot; with Weir on The Late Late Show, along with &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;. Weir was impressed with Mayer&#x27;s take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2016:

The thought of pop singer Mayer stepping in for Jerry Garcia was met with some initial skepticism by both fans and music critics, but the shows have since been well received. The band continues to tour 2022 and has considered recording a studio album consisting of songs from the Grateful Dead catalog and potentially some originals. In a 2017 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lesh praised the band&#x27;s performances and explained his decision not to take part:
===Author===
With the June 2004 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Mayer began a column called &quot;Music Lessons with John Mayer&quot;. Each article featured a lesson and his views on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written. The winner was Tim Fagan of Los Angeles as announced in the following January&#x27;s issue.

As social media gained momentum in the 2000s, Mayer became increasingly active online, and maintained four blogs: a Myspace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, one at tumblr, and a photoblog at StunningNikon.com. He was particularly prolific on Twitter, where he was noted for authoring his own posts, and he amassed 3.7 million followers. Although his posts often dealt with career-related matters, they also included jokes, videos, photos, and eventually what he called the &quot;maintenance of vapor&quot;—or misguided, personal responses to the media. On January 23, 2008, he posted the quote &quot;There is danger in theoretical speculation of battle, in prejudice, in false reasoning, in pride, in . There is one safe resource, the return to nature.&quot;; all the previous blog entries were deleted. On September 14, 2010, he deleted his personal Twitter account.

In the mid-2000s, he did comedy sporadically, making random appearances at the famed Comedy Cellar in New York and at other venues. He stated that it helped him write better, but that increased media attention made him too careful in his technique. He has since said he has no plans to return to it.

===Watch collector===
Mayer is an avid collector of watches, a pastime that he says keeps him &quot;sane&quot;. His collection—which he values in the &quot;tens of millions&quot; of dollars—includes a Patek Philippe with a Sky Moon Tourbillion, a Rolex GMT Master 116710 BLNR, and an IWC Big Pilot Ref 5002, his signature watch. He has also served as a juror at the Grand Prix d&#x27;Horlogerie de Genève, a competition rewarding timepieces that champion the values of Swiss-made watches and writes a column for the horology website Hodinkee. In his column for January 16, 2015, he wrote an open letter to the watch brand IWC, encouraging it to &quot;embrace [its] heritage, scale the product line down in terms of model variants, and simplify the design language&quot;. IWC replied, defending the changes they&#x27;ve made over the years, saying, &quot;We have a wonderful past, it is true—but in admiring what we achieved thus far, we hope you will feel encouraged to look forward to what we achieve in the future&quot;.

In March 2024, Mayer was appointed with the title of &quot;Creative Conduit&quot; at Audemars Piguet, to help facilitate the connection between the watch brand and collectors. In addition to the new role, Mayer and AP also announced a new limited-edition collaborative Perpetual Calendar Royal Oak model (Ref. 26574BC.OO.1220BC.02), dubbed the &quot;John Mayer&quot; and designed by its namesake. It features a &quot;Crystal Sky&quot; faceted blue dial, a white-gold case and bracelet, and is limited to 200 pieces.

===&quot;Current Mood&quot;===
During an appearance on the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; show in September 2018, Mayer showed a trailer for his new Instagram Live show. The show, entitled &quot;Current Mood&quot;, debuted on his IGTV account on Sunday evening on September 30, 2018. Episodes have continued to air on that schedule on a weekly basis. Guests have included Maggie Rogers, Halsey, B.J. Novak, Dave Chappelle, Charlie Puth, Finneas, Cazzie David, and Thundercat. Mayer&#x27;s latest season of &quot;Current Mood&quot; began on Sunday November 18, 2019, with guest Shawn Mendes and surprise feature with Camila Cabello on his first episode. For Current Mood Mayer coined notable jingles including &quot;Camila Camendes&quot;, &quot;CVS Bag&quot;, and &quot;Drone Shot of My Yacht&quot;.

=== Life with John Mayer ===
In October 2023, Mayer announced a new real-time satellite radio channel on Sirius XM, titled &quot;Life with John Mayer&quot;. The year-round channel features music curated by Mayer, including Mayer&#x27;s classics, collaborations, and never released material, along with selected music from all genres. In November 2024, Mayer began an interview series on the channel called &quot;How&#x27;s Life,&quot; featuring conversations with fellow musicians. Billy Joel was the first guest, followed by Shawn Mendes, and Maren Morris.

===Appearances in the media===
In 2004, Mayer hosted a one-shot, half-hour comedy special on VH1 titled &quot;John Mayer Has a TV Show&quot;, with antics including wearing a bear suit while anonymously teasing concertgoers in the parking lot outside one of his concerts.
Steve Jobs invited Mayer to perform during Apple&#x27;s annual keynote address at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in January 2004 as Jobs introduced the music production software GarageBand. Mayer became a fixture of the event, including at the 2007 iPhone announcement. Volkswagen concluded a deal with instrument manufacturer First Act to include a GarageMaster electric guitar that was playable through the stereo system of six of their 2007 models; Mayer (along with Slash and Christopher Guest) were selected to endorse the campaign and were featured playing the guitar in ads. Mayer used and endorsed the BlackBerry Curve.

Mayer made many appearances on talk shows and other television programs, most notably on a &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; comedy skit, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and on the final episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Mayer appeared with Rob Dyrdek in the MTV show &quot;Rob Dyrdek&#x27;s Fantasy Factory&quot;. Mayer wrote the theme song to the OWN network show &quot;Rollin&#x27; with Zach&quot;, which features Zach Anner. CBS invited him to guest host &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in early 2015 on three dates, February 4–6, after the retirement of Craig Ferguson. He appeared as a guest star on the fourth episode of the tenth season of the TruTV show Impractical Jokers in 2023.

Mayer makes a cameo as a truck driver in the 2014 comedy horror film &quot;Zombeavers&quot;. In the 2015 film &quot;Get Hard&quot;, he played a version of himself who is disgusted with the &quot;monetization of the creative process&quot;. Mayer also had a small role in the 2022 film &quot;Vengeance&quot;, playing a friend of the lead character.

==Instruments and equipment==
John Mayer is a guitar collector and has collaborated with elite guitar companies to design his own instruments. He owns over 200 guitars.

In 2003, Martin Guitars gave Mayer his own signature model acoustic guitar called the OM-28 John Mayer. The guitar was limited to a run of only 404, an Atlanta area code. This model was followed by the release of two Fender signature Stratocaster electric guitars, beginning in 2005. A third Stratocaster, finished in charcoal frost metallic paint with a racing stripe, was also a limited-release, with only 100 guitars made. In January 2006, Martin Guitars released the Martin OMJM John Mayer acoustic guitar. The guitar was intended to have many of the attributes of the Martin OM-28 John Mayer but with a more affordable price tag. In August 2006, Fender started manufacturing SERIES II John Mayer Stratocasters.

In January 2007, Two Rock collaborated with Mayer on custom-designed amps. Only 25 (all signed by Mayer himself) were made available to the public, along with a 500-run John Mayer signature Fender Stratocaster in Cypress-Mica. Included in the limited Cypress-Mica model was the INCSvsJM gig bag, on which Mayer collaborated on the in-case designs. In 2006, Mayer was estimated to have more than 200 guitars in his personal collection.

John Mayer&#x27;s most iconic guitar is the &quot;Black1&quot;. Conceived after the Heavier Things tour, Mayer went to Fender Custom Shop with the desire to build a guitar. He was inspired by guitars of famous players the likes of Rory Gallagher and Stevie Ray Vaughan. He sought out masterbuilder John Cruz to help devise the design. In essence, Mayer wanted an all-black version of Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;First Wife&quot; Stratocaster. The guitar is heavily &quot;relic&#x27;d&quot; to specs very similar to the guitar used by Stevie Ray Vaughan. The Black1 includes a mint pickguard, custom wound pickups, gold hardware, and gold tuners from the SRV Tribute Stratocaster. It was the principal guitar on the &quot;Continuum&quot; album. It was notably used on tracks such as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Trust Myself With Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Bold as Love&quot;. The Black1 has become a trademark to Mayer&#x27;s music.

The Fender Custom Shop made a limited run of 83 replica Black1 Stratocasters, all of which were sold within 24 hours. Each one was carefully relic&#x27;d by John Cruz. In 2010, Fender announced a production model of Mayer&#x27;s Black1 guitar. Un-relic&#x27;d production versions of the guitar were produced for a limited run of 500 worldwide. In addition, full production signature Stratocasters were produced in three-tone sunburst and Olympic White finishes.

In 2014, John Mayer announced that he was no longer a Fender Artist. As a result, his signature line of guitars was pulled from production. In 2015, Mayer announced that he was collaborating with PRS Guitars. In March 2016, Mayer and PRS revealed their collaborative project, the Super Eagle. This was a limited release from PRS&#x27;s Private Stock line of instruments and each guitar features ultra-grade woods, abalone inlay, JCF Audio preamps, and a hand-signed sticker by glass-artist David Smith. Only 100 were produced, each retailing for over $10,000. In January 2017 at the NAMM Show, PRS and Mayer announced the J-MOD 100 signature amp. In June 2017, the Super Eagle II was revealed, limited to 120 instruments.

In January 2018, Martin Guitar announced the limited-release (45 instruments) John Mayer Signature D-45, with list price $14,999. In March 2018, Mayer&#x27;s signature Silver Sky model was released by PRS, available in four colors. While &quot;Music Trade&quot; called the Silver Sky &quot;derivative&quot;, it said that all the elements were &quot;designed from the ground up&quot; and built with &quot;attention to detail&quot;. While acknowledging its similarity to a Stratocaster, Matt Blackett of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine ultimately said, &quot;The Silver Sky absolutely delivers on the promise of being a damn-near-perfect version of this type of guitar.&quot; The magazine named its &quot;Editor&#x27;s Pick&quot;.

Mayer owns multiple Dumble amplifiers, a highly exclusive brand of amps that only a handful of guitarists—including Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Robben Ford, and Carlos Santana—are known to play on a regular basis. In particular, Mayer owns the Dumbleland Special model used by Stevie Ray Vaughn to record his album &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. He used this amp during his performance for Vaughn&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which he called a &quot;special thing.&quot; For his album &quot;Sob Rock&quot;, Mayer recorded with a Fractal Axe-Fx digital amp modeler alongside his Dumble amps. Mayer has been credited for renewing industry interest in the Marshall Bluesbreaker overdrive pedal after he started using one for live performances. While unpopular during its brief production run in the early 1990s, the attention generated by Mayer&#x27;s use of the Bluesbreaker led to Marshall reissuing the entire line of effects pedals it was part of.

==Reception==
Mayer was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (#1020) in February 2007, along with John Frusciante and Derek Trucks, in an issue lauding the &quot;New Guitar Gods&quot;. The cover nicknamed him Slowhand Jr., a reference to Eric Clapton. Critics, however, often pointed to how safe they felt Mayer&#x27;s music was. Chris Richards, in a review of a 2017 concert, declared Mayer is &quot;an amazing guitar player&quot;, albeit doing so &quot;through clenched teeth&quot;. Richards went on to say that his talent as a guitarist did not make him exempt from criticism of &quot;his pillow-soft songcraft, the dull sentimentality of his lyrics, or that cuckoo-racist interview he gave to Playboy back in 2010&quot;. Music writer Steve Baltin commented on this dichotomy, saying that Mayer is &quot;one of the sharpest and savviest musical minds you will ever encounter&quot;, and added: &quot;While many have found reasons to dislike Mayer since the beginning of his career, he is a consummate musician&#x27;s musician, an artist who has been embraced by Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder and Buddy Guy among others.&quot;

Mayer&#x27;s inclusion in the line-up of Dead &amp; Company was criticised by Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes, who had previously played several shows with The Grateful Dead. Speaking during an interview with Howard Stern, Robinson was quoted as saying that &quot;everything that Jerry Garcia ever talked about or stood for, John Mayer is the antithesis&quot;, and that while &quot;Jerry was one of the most unique musicians in the world [...] here&#x27;s John Mayer playing everyone else&#x27;s licks&quot;. In response, Mayer said in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he &quot;care[s] about this band too much to give that [comment] life&quot;, and that he was &quot;done debating [his] own merits.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On his third episode of &quot;Current Mood&quot;, Mayer revealed he had been sober since 2016. He stopped drinking after having what he says was a six-day hangover after Drake&#x27;s 30th birthday party.
Mayer maintains close relationships with his father and siblings and embraces a domestic role when he is not on tour.

Mayer was a friend of the late comedian and actor Bob Saget, and when Saget unexpectedly died in an Orlando, Florida, hotel room in January 2022, Mayer had Saget&#x27;s body flown back to Los Angeles on a private jet. Likewise, he and Jeff Ross retrieved Saget&#x27;s car, which was parked at Los Angeles International Airport.

=== Relationships ===

Mayer has been romantically involved with Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly, Jennifer Aniston, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2002, Mayer created the &quot;Back to You&quot; Fund, a nonprofit organization that focuses on fundraising in the areas of health care, education, the arts and talent development. The foundation auctions exclusive John Mayer items, such as guitar picks, T-shirts and signed CDs. The auctions have been successful, with some tickets selling for more than 17 times their face value.

Mayer participated at the East Rutherford, New Jersey, location of the Live Earth project, a musical rally to support awareness for climate change held July 7, 2007.

Mayer performed at a number of benefits and telethons for charity throughout his career. He has participated in benefits for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. In response to the Virginia Tech shooting, Mayer (along with Dave Matthews Band, Phil Vassar, and Nas) performed a free concert at Virginia Tech&#x27;s Lane Stadium on September 6, 2007. followed by an appearance with Rob Thomas at the Annual Holiday Concert at Blythedale Children&#x27;s Hospital in Valhalla that winter. On December 8, 2007, Mayer hosted the first annual Charity Revue, a tradition he has continued each year. Charities who have benefited from the concerts include Toys for Tots, Inner City Arts and the Los Angeles Mission. CDs and DVDs of the first concert were released as &quot;Where the Light Is&quot; in July 2008. Mayer appeared on &quot;Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace&quot;, a celebrity initiative to support Tibet and the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. Mayer (along with Keith Urban) headlined Tiger Jam 2011 in Las Vegas to help raise around $750,000 for the Tiger Woods Foundation. In January 2013, Mayer participated with Zac Brown in a benefit concert in Bozeman, Montana where they raised more than $100,000 for firefighters who battled a wildfire in the summer of 2012 in Paradise Valley that destroyed 12,000 acres.

On March 1, 2019, Mayer established the Heart and Armor Foundation in support of veterans of war. He has been actively involved in initiatives to help returning veterans for about 12 years.

===Controversies===
Mayer&#x27;s relationship with Jessica Simpson coincided with behavior changes that significantly increased his tabloid exposure. Early in his career, he had expressed his resolve to completely avoid drugs, alcohol, clubbing, &quot;red-carpet&quot; events, dating celebrities, and anything that he felt would detract the focus from his music. In later interviews Mayer alluded to experiencing an extreme &quot;anxiety bender&quot; episode in his twenties that motivated him to be less reclusive. In 2006, he first mentioned that he had begun using marijuana. He began making appearances at clubs in Los Angeles and New York City, and Simpson became the first in a string of famous girlfriends, including Jennifer Aniston and Minka Kelly. By 2007, his personal life had become regular fodder for the gossip media and, as a result, Mayer made efforts to control his public image. His online presence increased, he began to stage pranks for the paparazzi, and he hosted a segment for the gossip show &quot;TMZ&quot;.
In early 2010, Mayer gave a controversial interview to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in which he revealed sexually explicit details about his former girlfriends Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston—calling his relationship with the former &quot;sexual napalm&quot;. In response to a question about whether black women were interested in him, he said, &quot;My dick is sort of like a white supremacist. I&#x27;ve got a Benetton heart and a fuckin&#x27; David Duke cock. I&#x27;m going to start dating separately from my dick.&quot; He also used the word &quot;nigger&quot; in the interview. This set off accusations in the media of him being a misogynist, ex-boyfriend, and racist. He apologized via Twitter for his use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, saying, &quot;It was arrogant of me to think I could intellectualize...a word that is so emotionally charged&quot;. He also tearfully apologized to his band and fans at his concert in Nashville later that night. In the following two years, he left New York and retreated from the media. Reflecting on that time in a May 2012 episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, he said: &quot;I lost my head for a little while and I did a couple of dumb interviews and it kind of woke me up...It was a violent crash into being an adult. For a couple of years, it was just figuring it all out, and I&#x27;m glad I actually stayed out of the spotlight.&quot;

Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift performed vocals for the song &quot;Half of My Heart&quot; on Mayer&#x27;s November 2009 album &quot;Battle Studies&quot;. Rumors began to circulate in the media that the two were a couple, an assertion that neither addressed. However, Swift released a song called &quot;Dear John&quot; in 2010, which was widely believed to be about her relationship with him. In June 2012, Mayer criticized the song, saying she never contacted him and that &quot;it&#x27;s abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, &#x27;Wait till he gets a load of this!&#x27;&quot; The song &quot;Paper Doll&quot; was reported to be a response. In the March 21, 2019, episode of &quot;Current Mood&quot;, however, Mayer said: &quot;When &#x27;Paper Doll&#x27; came out, 100% of the people believed it was about somebody...But the song was not about that person and I could never tell anybody, &#x27;That&#x27;s not true,&#x27; because then I would be breaking my rule that songwriters don&#x27;t say who the songs are about or not about.&quot;

In March 2014, Mayer sued watch dealer Robert Maron for $656,000 when he discovered that seven of the $5 million in watches he purchased from the dealer contained counterfeit parts. He dropped the action in May 2015, releasing a statement that asserted that research restored his &quot;belief that Bob Maron is an expert on Rolex watches and confirmed that Bob Maron never sold him a counterfeit watch.&quot;

<text>The Cathedral of Saint Mary Major ( or &quot;Sé-Catedral Metropolitana Patriarcal de Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa&quot;), often called Lisbon Cathedral or simply the Sé (&quot;), is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Lisbon, Portugal. It is the oldest church in the city, built in 1147. The cathedral has survived many earthquakes and has been modified, renovated and restored several times, resulting in a mix of different architectural styles. It is the seat of the Patriarchate of Lisbon, and has been classified as a National Monument since 1910.

==History==

Lisbon has been the seat of a bishopric since the 4th century (see Patriarch of Lisbon). After the period of Visigothic domination, the city was conquered by the Moors and stayed under Arab control from the 8th to the 12th century, although Christians were allowed to live in Lisbon and its surroundings. In the year 1147, the city was reconquered by an army composed of Portuguese soldiers led by King Afonso Henriques and North European crusaders taking part in the Second Crusade (see Siege of Lisbon). An English crusader named Gilbert of Hastings was installed as bishop, and a new cathedral was built on the site of the main mosque of Lisbon.

This first building, in Late Romanesque style, was completed between 1147 and the first decades of the 13th century. At that time, the relics of St Vincent of Saragossa, patron saint of Lisbon, were brought to the cathedral from Southern Portugal. In the late 13th century, King Dinis of Portugal built a Gothic cloister and his successor, Afonso IV of Portugal, had the main chapel converted into a royal pantheon in Gothic style for him and his family. In 1498, Queen Eleanor of Viseu founded the &quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of Invocation to Our Lady of Mercy of Lisbon &quot;) in one of the chapels of the cathedral cloister. This brotherhood evolved into the &quot;Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa&quot;, a Catholic charitable institution that later spread to other cities and had a very important role in Portugal and its colonies.

During the Portuguese interregnum of 1383–85, the populace suspected that Bishop Dom Martinho Annes was plotting with the Castilians and an angry crowd threw him out of the window of the northern tower
Earthquakes have always been a problem for Lisbon and its cathedral. There were several in the 14th and 16th centuries, but the worst of all was the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which destroyed the Gothic main chapel along with the royal pantheon. The cloisters and many chapels were also ruined by the quake and the fire that followed. The cathedral was partially rebuilt and an extensive renovation in the early 20th century gave it its current appearance.
In recent years, the central courtyard of the cloister has been excavated and remains from the Roman, Visigothic and mediaeval periods have been found. Excavations started in the cloister in 1990 and revealed a Roman road with shops on either side, part of a Roman kitchen and a &quot;cloaca&quot; (sewage system), as well as traces of later Visigoth buildings. A section of red walls was also excavated, showing remains of a mosque which had once stood on this site.

In 2020, Graça Fonseca, the Portuguese Minister of Culture, determined that the Muslim remains should be preserved.

==Art and architecture==
The cathedral is in the shape of a Latin cross with three aisles, a transept and a main chapel surrounded by an ambulatory. The church is connected with a cloister on the eastern side. The main façade of the cathedral looks like a fortress, with two towers flanking the entrance and crenellations over the walls. This menacing appearance, also seen in other Portuguese cathedrals of the time, is a relic from the Reconquista period, when the cathedral may have been used as a base to attack the enemy during a siege.

===Romanesque===
From its first building period (1147 until the first decades of the 13th century), Lisbon cathedral has preserved the West façade with a rose window (rebuilt from fragments in the 20th century), the main portal, the North lateral portal and the nave of the cathedral. The portals have interesting sculptured capitals with Romanesque motifs. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and has an upper, arched gallery (triforium). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West façade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral aisles of the nave as well as the windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very similar to that of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.

===Gothic===
At the end of the 13th century King Dinis of Portugal ordered the construction of a cloister in Gothic style, which became severely damaged by the 1755 earthquake. Near the entrance of the cathedral, a rich merchant, Bartolomeu Joanes, built a funerary chapel for himself in the beginning of the 14th century. His tomb with his laying figure is still inside. Somewhat later, King Afonso IV of Portugal had the Romanesque apse replaced by a Gothic main chapel surrounded by an ambulatory with radiating chapels. The king and his family were buried in the main chapel, but their tombs and the chapel itself were destroyed in the 1755 earthquake. The ambulatory has survived and is an important work in the history of Portuguese Gothic. It consists of a circular aisle – not connected to the main chapel – with a series of radiating chapels. The second storey of the ambulatory is covered by ribbed vaulting and has a series of windows (clerestory) that bathe the interior with abundant light.

The ambulatory contains three outstanding Gothic tombs from the mid-14th century. One tomb belongs to &quot;Lopo Fernandes Pacheco&quot;, 7th Lord of Ferreira de Aves, a nobleman at the service of King Afonso IV. His laying figure appears holding his sword and is guarded by a dog. His wife, &quot;Maria de Vilalobos&quot;, appears over her tomb reading a Book of Hours. The third tomb belongs to an unidentified royal princess. All tombs are decorated with coats-of-arms.
In the last quarter of the 15th century it is believed that the famous Saint Vincent Panels, painted by Nuno Gonçalves, were placed in the St Vincent chapel of the ambulatory. They remained there at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra. The panels are now in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (National Museum of Ancient Art) in Lisbon.

===Modern times===
During the 17th century a fine sacristy was built in Baroque architectural style and, after 1755, the main chapel was rebuilt in neoclassical and Rococo styles (including the tombs of King Afonso IV and his family). Machado de Castro, Portugal&#x27;s foremost sculptor in the late 18th century, is the author of a magnificent crib in the Gothic chapel of Bartomoleu Joanes. In the beginning of the 20th century, much of the neoclassical decoration from outside and inside of the cathedral was removed to give the cathedral a more &quot;mediaeval&quot; appearance.

<text>Kefalonia or Cephalonia (), formerly also known as Kefallinia or Kephallonia (), is the largest of the Ionian Islands in western Greece and the 6th largest island in Greece after Crete, Euboea, Lesbos, Rhodes and Chios. It is also a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region. It was a former Latin Catholic diocese Kefalonia–Zakynthos (Cefalonia–Zante) and short-lived titular see as just Kefalonia. The capital city of Cephalonia is Argostoli.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
====Legend====
An &quot;aition&quot; explaining the name of Cephallenia and reinforcing its cultural connections with Athens associates the island with the mythological figure of Cephalus, who helped Amphitryon of Mycenae in a war against the Taphians and Teleboans. He was rewarded with the island of Same, which thereafter came to be known as Cephallenia.

Kefalonia has also been suggested as the Homeric Ithaca, the home of Odysseus, rather than the smaller island bearing this name today. Robert Bittlestone, in his book &quot;Odysseus Unbound&quot;, has suggested that Paliki, now a peninsula of Cephalonia, was a separate island during the late Bronze Age, and it may be this which Homer was referring to when he described Ithaca. A project which started in the summer of 2007 and lasted three years has examined this possibility.

Kefalonia is also referenced in relation to the goddess Britomartis, as the location where she is said to have &#x27;received divine honours from the inhabitants under the name of Laphria&#x27;.

==== Archaic and Classical Periods ====
From at least the 6th century BC the island was dominated by four city-states (&quot;poleis&quot;): Pale (modern Lixouri), Cranii (mod. Argostoli), Same (mod. Sami) and Pronnoi. All four minted their own coins, as well as building monumental temples and fortifications, both in the cities themselves and in the surrounding countryside. Ancient writers generally paid little attention to the island throughout antiquity, but there are some notable references, and it seems that the Kefalonian cities were involved in developments and events across the wider Greek world. A certain Melampous, from Kefalonia, won the Lyre and Song contest at the Pythian Games at Delphi in 582 BC. 200 hoplites from Pale fought alongside other Greeks against the Persians in the decisive battle at Plataea, and all four Kefalonian cities allied with Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The island was of strategic value to the Athenians, as it lies close to the entry to the Bay of Corinth. The Corinthians attempted, unsuccessfully, to attack Krane in 431 BC, and, 10 years later, Athens settled a group of Spartan deserters on the island. Finally, a group of Kefalonian soldiers were recruited by the Athenian general Demosthenes as part of the ill-fated Sicilian Expedition in 415-413 BC.

==== Hellenistic and Roman Periods ====
The Kefalonian cities retained close ties with Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War, despite the Spartan victory. Athenian influence, including heavy direct taxation in the 4th century BC, may have been a stimulus for a new planned and fortified town at Same, which increasingly seems to have dominated the smaller &quot;polis&quot; of Pronnoi.

The Kefalonian cities once again contributed troops and ships to broader Greek military events, this time Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion and conquest of the Persian Empire. In the subsequent centuries, the island was drawn ever close to the Aetolian League. As a result, it was invaded by the Macedonian king Philip V in 218 BC and then by the Roman republic in 189 BC, who conquered Same after a protracted siege. From then onwards, Kefalonia lost its strategic importance, and so declined in social and economic terms. Archaeologically, the Roman period is dominated by lavish villas on the coasts, contrasted with little activity in the old towns. The ancient links to Athens seem to have remained strong, as the emperor Hadrian gifted the island to the city during his reign.

===Middle Ages===
In the late Roman Empire, Cephalonia was part of the Roman province of Achaea. Ecclesiastically it was a suffragan of the Metropolis of Nicopolis (the eparchy of Epirus I). The four ancient cities of the island survived into late antiquity, with Sami probably as the island&#x27;s capital.

Following the loss of the bulk of Italy, and the expansion of the Muslims into the Western Mediterranean, the island became a strategically important base of operations for the Byzantine Empire in the area, blocking Muslim raids into the Adriatic and serving as a bridge for expeditions in Italy. Already from the 8th century, it was the centre of the namesake theme of Cephallenia. At the same time, the capital was moved to the Castle of Saint George, a more well-protected site in the island&#x27;s interior. Mardaites were resettled in Cephalonia to serve as marines, and political prisoners were sometimes exiled there.

The loss of Byzantine Italy in 1071 diminished Cephalonia&#x27;s importance, and its administration passed from a military &quot;strategos&quot; to a civilian judge (&quot;krites&quot;). Its main city was besieged by the Italo-Normans in 1085, and the Venetians plundered the island in 1126. Cephalonia was captured during the Third Norman invasion of the Balkans in 1185, and it became part of the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos under the Kingdom of Sicily and Venetian suzerainty, until its last Count Leonardo III Tocco was defeated and the island conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1479.

===Venetian rule===

Turkish rule lasted only until 1500, when Cephalonia was captured by a Spanish-Venetian army, a rare Venetian success in the Second Ottoman–Venetian War. In the aftermath of the Venetian conquest, the island received an influx of civilian and military (stradioti) refugees from the lost Venetian fortresses of Modon and Coron, as well as many colonists from the Venetian-ruled island of Crete.

From then on Cephalonia and Ithaca remained part of the Stato da Mar of the Venetian Republic until its very end, following the fate of the Ionian islands, completed by the capture of Lefkas from the Turks in 1684. The Treaty of Campoformio dismantling the Venetian Republic awarded the Ionian Islands to France, a French expeditionary force on ships captured in Venice taking control of the islands in June 1797.

Because of the liberal situation on the island, the Venetian governor Marc&#x27;Antonio Giustiniani (1516–1571) printed Hebrew books and exported them to the whole eastern Mediterranean. In 1596 the Venetians built the Assos Castle, one of Cephalonia&#x27;s main tourist attractions today. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, the island was one of the largest exporters of currants in the world with Zakynthos, and owned a large shipping fleet, even commissioning ships from the Danzig shipyard. Its towns and villages were mostly built high on hilltops, to prevent attacks from raiding parties of pirates that sailed the Ionian Sea during the 1820s.

===French, Ionian state period and British rule===
Venice was conquered by France in 1797 and Cephalonia, along with the other Ionian Islands, became part of the French département of Ithaque.

In the following year, 1798, the French were forced to yield the Ionian Islands to a combined Russian and Turkish fleet. From 1799 to 1807, Cephalonia was part of the Septinsular Republic, nominally under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, but protected by Russia.

By the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, the Ionian Islands were ceded back to France, which remained in control of Cephalonia until 1809. In 1809, the British established a blockade on the Ionian Islands as part of their conflict with France, and in September of that year they hoisted the Union Flag above the castle of Zakynthos. Cephalonia and Ithaca soon surrendered, and the British installed provisional governments. The Treaty of Paris in 1815 recognised the United States of the Ionian Islands and decreed that it become a British protectorate. Colonel Charles Philippe de Bosset became provisional governor between 1810 and 1814. During this period he was credited with achieving many public works, including the Drapano Bridge, which later became known as the De Bosset Bridge, over the bay of Argostoli.

A few years later Greek nationalist groups started to form. Although their energy in the early years was directed to supporting the Greeks in the revolution against the Ottoman Empire, it soon started to turn towards the British. By 1848, calls for &quot;enosis&quot; with Greece were gaining strength and there were rebellions against British rule in Argostoli and Lixouri, which led to some relaxation in the laws and to freedom of the press. Union with Greece was now a declared aim, and in 1849, as revolution was sweeping across Europe, a growing restlessness resulted in another rebellion against the British state, which was suppressed by the island&#x27;s governor, Sir Henry George Ward when 21 people were hanged, several were shot and hundreds were flogged by the cat-o-nine-tails.

Cephalonia, along with the other islands, were transferred to Greece in 1864 as a gesture of goodwill when the British-supported Prince William of Denmark became King George the First of the Hellenes.

===Union with Greece===
In 1864, Cephalonia, together with all the other Ionian Islands, became a full member of the Greek state.

===World War II===


In World War II, the island was occupied by Axis forces. Until late 1943, the occupying force was predominantly Italian, the 33rd Infantry Division &quot;Acqui&quot; plus Navy personnel totalled 12,000 men, but about 2,000 troops from Germany were also present. The island was largely spared the fighting, until the armistice with Italy concluded by the Allies in September 1943. Confusion followed on the island, as the Italians were hoping to return home, but German forces did not want the Italians&#x27; munitions to be used eventually against them; Italian forces were hesitant to turn over weapons for the same reason. As German reinforcements headed to the island the Italians dug in and, eventually, after a referendum among the soldiers as to surrender or battle, they fought against the new German invasion. The fighting came to a head at the siege of Argostoli, where the Italians held out. Ultimately the Germans prevailed, taking full control of the island.

Approximately five thousand of the nine thousand surviving Italian soldiers were executed in reprisal by the German forces. The book &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; by Louis de Bernières, which was later made into a film, is based on this event. While the war ended in central Europe in 1945, Cephalonia remained in a state of conflict due to the Greek Civil War. Peace returned to Greece and the island in 1949. 

===Earthquake of 1953===

Cephalonia lies just to the southeast of a major active fault zone, where the Eurasian Plate meets the Aegean Plate at a transform boundary. The island itself is affected by a series of active thrust faults, which are responsible for the continuing uplift.

A series of four earthquakes hit the island in August 1953, and caused major destruction, with virtually every house on the island destroyed. The third and most destructive of the quakes took place on 12 August 1953 at 09:24 UTC (11:24 local time), with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Moment magnitude scale. Its epicentre was directly south of the southern tip of Cephalonia, and caused the entire island to be raised higher, where it remains, with evidence in water marks on rocks around the coastline.

The 1953 Ionian earthquake disaster caused huge destruction, with only regions in the north escaping the heaviest tremors and houses there remaining intact. Damage was estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars, equivalent to billions of drachmas, but the real damage to the economy occurred when residents left the island. The majority of the population left the island soon after, seeking a new life elsewhere.

===Recent history===
The forest fire of the 1990s caused damage to the island&#x27;s forests and bushes, especially a small scar north of Troianata, and a large area of damage extending from Kateleios north to west of Tzanata, ruining about of forest and bushes and resulting in the loss of some properties. The forest fire scar was visible for some years.

In mid-November 2003, an earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter magnitude scale caused minor damage to business, residential property, and other buildings in and near Argostoli. The damage was around €1,000,000.

On the morning of 20 September 2005, an early-morning earthquake shook the south-western part of the island, especially near Lixouri and nearby villages. The earthquake measured 4.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, and its epicentre was located off the island at sea. Service vehicles took care of the area, and no damage was reported. From 24 to 26 January 2006, a major snowstorm blanketed the entire island, causing extensive blackouts. The island was recently struck yet again by another forest fire in the south of the island, beginning of 18 July 2007 during an unusual heatwave, and spreading slowly. Firefighters along with helicopters and planes battled the blaze for some days and the spectacle frightened residents on that area of the island.

In 2011, the eight former municipalities of the island lost their independence to form one united municipality. After losing its role as the capital of the island in the 19th century, Lixouri lost also its role as a seat of a municipality after 500 years. The Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands closed one faculty in Lixouri and one in Argostoli.

In January 2014, an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale left at least seven injured. There are reports of minor injuries and some damage to property,&quot; said the Foreign Office, on its website. &quot;The airport remains operational but there may be some disruption to port services.&quot;

==Archaeology==
In the southwestern portion of the island, in the area of Leivatho, an ongoing archaeological field survey by the Irish Institute at Athens has discovered dozens of sites with dates ranging from the Palaeolithic to the Venetian period.

Cephalonia is extremely interesting archaeologically; finds go back to 40,000 BP. Without doubt, the most important era for the island is the Mycenaean era, from approximately 1500 BC to 1100 BC. The archaeological museum in Cephalonia&#x27;s capital, although small, is of great importance due to its exhibits from this era.

The most important archaeological discovery in Cephalonia (and indeed in Greece) of recent decades is that, in 1991, of the Mycenaean Tholos tomb at the outskirts of Tzanata, near Poros in southeastern Cephalonia (former Municipality of Elios-Pronni) in a setting of olive trees, cypresses, and oaks. The tomb was erected around 1300 BC; kings and highly ranked officials were buried in such tombs during the Mycenaean period. It is the largest tholos tomb yet found in northwestern Greece, and was excavated by archaeologist Lazaros Kolonas. The size of the tomb, the nature of the burial offerings found there, and its well-chosen position point to the existence of an important Mycenaean town in the vicinity.

In late 2006, a Roman grave complex was uncovered as the foundation of a new hotel was being excavated in Fiskardo. The remains date to the period between the 2nd century BC and the 4th century AD. Archaeologists described it as the most important find of its kind in the Ionian Islands. Inside the complex, five burial sites were found, including a large vaulted tomb and a stone coffin, along with gold earrings and rings, gold leaves that may have been attached to ceremonial clothing, glass and ceramic pots, bronze artefacts decorated with masks, a bronze lock and bronze coins. The tomb had escaped the attention of grave robbers and remained undisturbed for thousands of years. When the tomb was opened the stone door easily swung on its stone hinges. A Roman theatre was discovered very near the tomb, so well preserved that the metal joints between the seats were still intact.

A dissertation published in 1987 claims that Paul the Apostle, on his way from Palestine to Rome in 59 AD, was shipwrecked and confined for three months not on Malta but on Cephalonia.

According to Clement of Alexandria, the island had the largest community of Carpocratians, an early Gnostic Christian sect, because Carpocrates lived on the island.

==Population: historical evolution==
In the ancient period, the people lived in four cities on the island. Cranii, Sami(or Samos), Pale and Pronnoi(Proni) formed a federation called &quot;tetrapolis&quot;.

In more recent times, the population reached 70,000, in 1896, but declined gradually in the 20th century. The great 1953 Ionian earthquake forced many people to leave the island. Many of those who left moved to Patras or Athens, or emigrated to America and Australia, following relatives who had left the island decades before. In the same period people from poorer areas of Greece such as Epirus and Thrace came to the island. The population has hovered between 35,000 and 42,000 since then; in the 2011 census, it was 35,801.

Most of the indigenous people of Cephalonia have surnames ending in &quot;-atos&quot;, such as the Alexatos (Greek: Αλεξάτος) families, and almost every settlement on the island has a name ending in &quot;-ata&quot;, such as Metaxata, Chavriata, Frangata, Lourdata, Favata, Delaportata and others.

== Ecclesiastical history ==

In 1222 the Frankish Crusaders established the Diocese of Kefalonia–Zakynthos (Cefalonia–Zante in Curiate Italian), which survived their rule and even the Turks. In 1919, the residential see was suppressed but immediately transformed into a titular bishopric of Kefalonia (Cefalonia in Italian). The territory and title were merged into the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Corfu–Zakynthos–Kefalonia. In 1921, this was also suppressed, never having had an incumbent.

== Geography ==


The main island of the regional unit is Cephalonia and has a size of , with a population density of . The town of Argostoli has one-third of the island&#x27;s inhabitants. Lixouri is the second major settlement, and the two towns together account for almost two-thirds of the prefecture&#x27;s population.

The other major islands are: Petalas Island and Asteris Island, but they are uninhabited.

Cephalonia lies in the heart of an earthquake zone, and dozens of minor, unrecorded tremors occur each year. In 1953, a massive earthquake destroyed almost all of the settlements on the island, leaving only Fiskardo in the north untouched.

Important natural features include Melissani Lake, the Drogarati caves, and the Koutavos Lagoon in Argostoli.

The island has a rich biodiversity, with a substantial number of endemic and rare species. Some areas have been declared a site in the European Union&#x27;s Natura 2000 network.

=== Mountains ===
The island&#x27;s highest mountain is Mount Ainos, with an elevation of 1628 meters; to the west-northwest are the Paliki mountains, where Lixouri is found, with other mountains including Geraneia (Gerania) and Agia Dynati. The top of Mount Ainos is covered with fir trees and is a natural park.

Forestry is rare on the island; however its timber output is one of the highest in the Ionian islands, although lower than that of Elia in the Peloponnese. Forest fires were common during the 1990s and the early 2000s, and still pose a major threat to the population.

=== Capes ===
*Cape Agios Georgios: approximate coordinates 
*Cape Kounopetra
*Cape Atheras: north-western corner of island

=== Flora ===
Most of the Ainos mountain range is designated as a National Park and is covered with the rare species of Greek fir (Abies cephalonica) and black pine (Pinus nigra).

=== Fauna ===
Cephalonia is well known for its endangered loggerhead turtle population, also known as the Caretta caretta turtle, which nests on many of the beaches along the south coast of the island. The turtles can also be seen in the waters of Argostoli harbour, in Koutavos Lagoon, while walking on De Bosset Bridge. A small population of the endangered Mediterranean monk seal, &quot;Monachus monachus&quot;, also lives around the island&#x27;s coast, especially on parts of the coast which are inaccessible to humans due to the terrain. Caves on these parts of the coast offer ideal locations for the seals to give birth to their pups and nurse them through the first months of their lives. The most famous breeding ground in Cephalonia is a cave on Foki beach, located on the north-east coast near Fiskardo.

The European pine marten also inhabits the island.

Over 200 species of birds have been spotted on the island.

===Climate===

Cephalonia has hot, sunny summers and mild rainy winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). During winter it can occasionally snow on the mountain peaks of the island&#x27;s mountains. The winter months can experience up to 156 mm of rainfall, resulting in high levels of humidity on the island. Winter temperature on Kefalonia average at 14-15 °C during the day and 8-9 °C during the night. During the summer months there is usually little to no rainfall. Temperatures range from nearly 30 °C during the day to around 21 °C at night.

== Economy ==
Wine and raisins are the oldest products exported, being important until the 20th century. Today fish farming and calcium carbonate are most important.
Most Greek ship-owner families have their origin in the islands of Andros, Chios or Cephalonia.

=== Agriculture ===
The primary agricultural occupations are animal breeding and olive growing, with the remainder largely composed of grain and vegetables. Most vegetable production takes place on the plains, which cover less than 15% of the island, most of which is rugged and mountainous, suitable only for goats. Less than a quarter of the island&#x27;s land is arable.

Until the 1970s, most Cephalonians lived in rural areas, while today, two-thirds of the population lives in urban areas, with the other third in rural towns and villages close to farmland.

The island has a long winemaking tradition and is home to the dry, white lemony wines made from the Robola grape.

=== Olive oil production ===
Olive oil production is a major component of Cephalonia&#x27;s economy. Until the 18th century, the quantity of olive oil produced on the island just covered the needs of the residents. However, the pressure of Venetian conquerors&#x27; for olive plantation, especially after the loss of Peloponnese and Crete, resulted in increasing the production to such a degree that the first exports to Venice began. Before the 1953 Ionian earthquake, there were 200 oil presses operating on the island; today, there are thirteen. There are over one million olive trees on Cephalonia, covering almost 55% of the island&#x27;s area. Olive oil is very important to the island&#x27;s local, agricultural economy. &quot;Koroneiki&quot; and &quot;theiako&quot; are the two main varieties cultivated on the island, followed by a smaller number of &quot;ntopia&quot; and &quot;matolia&quot;. Kefalonian olive oil has a green tone, a rich, greasy touch, and low acidity.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism to Cephalonia started in the early 19th century. The royal family of Greece sent their children in the summer Lixouri, in the early 20th century, but the island was not discovered by most tourists until the 1980s. Cephalonia is a popular holiday destination for many Italians, due to its proximity to Italy.

Two cultural attractions, the fishing villages of Fiscardo and Assos, and other natural attractions, including Melissani underground lake, Drogarati cave and Myrtos beach, have helped popularize Cephalonia. The film &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin (film)&quot; (2001), filmed on the island, made Cephalonia more widely known. The film was mainly shot in Argostoli, Sami and on Antisamos Beach.

== Culture ==


=== Monasteries and churches ===

Across the broader island, two large monasteries are to be found: the first is that of Haghia Panagia in Markopoulo to the southeast, and the other lies on the road between Argostoli and Michata, on a small plain surrounded by mountains. This second has an avenue of about 200 trees aligned from NW to SE, with a circle in the middle, and is the monastery of Saint Gerasimus of Kefalonia, patron saint of the island, whose relics can be seen and venerated at the old church of the monastery. The monastery of &quot;Sissia&quot; was probably founded by Francis of Assisi, it was destroyed in 1953 but the ruins still exist. Although much of the island was destroyed by earthquakes, many notable churches all over the island have survived, some dating back to the renaissance. The ornaments of the churches are influenced by Venetian manierism.

=== Music ===

The Ionian Islands have a musical tradition called the Ionian School. Lixouri has the Philharmonic Orchestra (since 1836) and Argostoli the Rokos Vergottis Conservatory. Richard Strauss visited Lixouri some times where he had an affair with the pianist Dora Wihan (born Weiss).

The Ionian Islands also developed a distinctive culture primarily as they did not experience Ottoman occupation, instead having ties to Venice, and musically drew from Italian influences, and Western Harmonics. This evolved into a unique musical style among the Greeks, the Cantada (Serenade) very similar to the Latin/Spanish/Italian Cantar (to sing). The Cantadas are an example of the Ionian music. Cantadas are still very popular and can be heard even today.

=== Literature and film ===
The novelists Nikos Kavvadias (1910–1975) and the Swiss (1917–2010) spent parts of their life on the island. Andreas Laskaratos was a satirical poet and wrote about the society in the town of Lixouri. Lord Byron wrote parts of &quot;Prelude&quot; and &quot;Don Juan&quot; in Livatho.

Additionally, a theory was proposed by Greek researcher Libieris Liberatos as to the true identity of the island setting from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; being Cephallonia.

Perhaps the best known appearance of Cephalonia in popular culture is in the novel &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;, by the English author Louis de Bernières. The book is believed to have been inspired by the village of Farsa, just outside Argostoli. The love story comprising the theme of the book is set before and after the Acqui Division massacre, during the Second World War. A film adaptation was released in 2001. During filming there was lively debate between the production team, local authorities as well as groups of citizens, as to the complex historical details of the island&#x27;s antifascist resistance. As a result, political references were omitted from the film, and the romantic core of the book was preserved, without entering complex debates about the island&#x27;s history. In 2005, Riccardo Milani made his TV film, &quot;Cefalonia&quot;, also about the massacre, with music by Ennio Morricone.

== Transportation ==
=== Harbours and ports ===
There are five harbours and ports in the prefecture and you can get to Kefalonia by boat: four main harbours on the island, Sami, a major port with links to Patras and Ithaca; Poros, in the south, has ferry routes to Kyllini; Argostoli, in the west, is the largest port, for local boats and ferries to Zante and regularly to Lixouri; Fiscardo, in the north, has links to Lefkas and Ithaca. There is room for about 100 small boats in Argostoli, where the port stretches 1 kilometre around the bay, while Lixouri is situated across the bay from Argostoli, on the Lixouri peninsula. There is a road connection to the rest of the island, but driving from Lixouri to Argostoli involves a detour.

=== Roads ===
The first larger roads were built by the British in the 19th century. In the 20th century asphalted roads were built, and since 1995 almost all streets connecting villages and beaches are covered with asphalt. Since c. 2000 the Lixouri bypass was built and a four lane street south of Argostoli was constructed.
Some important roads include:

*Greek National Road 50, commonly Argostoli-Sami Road
*Argostoli-Poros Road
*Argostoli-Fiskardo Road (with link to Lixouri).
*Road linking Poros and Sami

=== Public transportation ===
The ferry between Argostoli and Lixouri goes every hour and every half-hour in the season. There are a few bus lines serving the more rural areas of Kefalonia, but often only two times a day. The KTEL bus cooperation offers services from Lixouri, Poros and Argostoli to the mainland.

=== Airport ===
Cephalonia has one airport, Kefalonia Island International Airport, named Anna Pollatou (IATA: EFL, ICAO: LGKF) with a runway around . in length, located about south of Argostoli. Almost every scheduled flight is an Olympic Air route, flying mainly to and from Athens, although there is an Ionian Island Hopper service three times a week calling at Cephalonia, Zante and Lefkas. In summer the airport handles a number of charter flights from all over Europe.

In December 2015 the privatisation of Kefalonia Airport and 13 other regional airports of Greece was finalised with the signing of the agreement between the Fraport AG/Copelouzos Group joint venture and the state privatisation fund. &quot;We signed the deal today,&quot; the head of Greece&#x27;s privatisation agency HRADF, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. According to the agreement, the joint venture will operate the 14 airports (including Kefallinia International Airport) for 40 years as of autumn 2016.

== Administration ==
Cephalonia is a distinct regional unit of the Ionian Islands region, and since 2019 it consists of three municipalities: Argostoli, Lixouri and Sami. Between the 2011 Kallikratis government reform and 2019, there was one single municipality on the island: Cephalonia, created out of the 8 former municipalities on the island. At the same reform, the regional unit Cephalonia was created out of part of the former Cephalonia Prefecture. The seat of administration is Argostoli, the island&#x27;s main town.

The municipality of Argostoli consists of the following municipal units (former municipalities):
* Argostoli
* Eleios-Pronnoi
* Leivatho
* Omala

The municipality of Sami consists of the following municipal units:
* Erisos
* Pylaros
* Sami

The municipality of Lixouri coincides with the former municipality Paliki.

The regional unit has an area of 786.575 km2. The Cephalonia regional unit also includes a number of uninhabited islands of the Echinades group. They are administered by the municipal unit of Pylaros. The most significant are as follows:

<text>An online community, called an internet community or web community, is a community whose members interact with each other primarily via the Internet. Members of the community usually share common interests. For many, online communities may feel like home, consisting of a &quot;family of invisible friends&quot;. Additionally, these &quot;friends&quot; can be connected through gaming communities and gaming companies. Those who wish to be a part of an online community usually have to become a member via a specific site and just to specific content or links.

An online community can act as an information system where members can post, comment on discussions, give advice or collaborate, and includes medical advice or specific health care research as well. Commonly, people communicate through social networking sites, chat rooms, forums, email lists, and discussion boards, and have advanced into daily social media platforms as well. This includes Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Discord, etc. People may also join online communities through video games, blogs, and virtual worlds, and could potentially meet new significant others in dating sites or dating virtual worlds.

The rise in popularity of Web 2.0 websites has allowed for easier real-time communication and connection to others and facilitated the introduction of new ways for information to be exchanged. Yet, these interactions may also lead to a downfall of social interactions or deposit more negative and derogatory forms of speaking to others, in connection, surfaced forms of racism, bullying, sexist comments, etc. may also be investigated and linked to online communities.

One scholarly definition of an online community is this: &quot;a virtual community is defined as an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least partially supported or mediated by technology (or both) and guided by some protocols or norms&quot;.

== Purpose ==
Digital communities (web communities but also communities that are formed over, e.g., Xbox and PlayStation) provide a platform for a range of services to users. It has been argued that they can fulfill Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. They allow for social interaction across the world between people of different cultures who might not otherwise have met with offline meetings also becoming more common. Another key use of web communities is access to and the exchange of information. With communities for even very small niches it is possible to find people also interested in a topic and to seek and share information on a subject where there are not such people available in the immediate area offline. This has led to a range of popular sites based on areas such as health, employment, finances and education. Online communities can be vital for companies for marketing and outreach.

Unexpected and innovative uses of web communities have also emerged with social networks being used in conflicts to alert citizens of impending attacks. The UN sees the web and specifically social networks as an important tool in conflicts and emergencies.

Web communities have grown in popularity; 6 of the 20 most-trafficked websites were community-based sites. The amount of traffic to such websites is expected to increase as a growing proportion of the world&#x27;s population attains Internet access.

==Categorization==
The idea of a community is not a new concept. On the telephone, in ham radio and in the online world, social interactions no longer have to be based on proximity; instead they can literally be with anyone anywhere. The study of communities has had to adapt along with the new technologies. Many researchers have used ethnography to attempt to understand what people do in online spaces, how they express themselves, what motivates them, how they govern themselves, what attracts them, and why some people prefer to observe rather than participate. Online communities can congregate around a shared interest and can be spread across multiple websites.

Some features of online communities include:
*Content: articles, information, and news about a topic of interest to a group of people.
*Forums or newsgroups and email: so that community members can communicate in delayed fashion.
*Chat and instant messaging: so that community members can communicate more immediately.

===Development===
Online communities typically establish a set of values, sometimes known collectively as netiquette or Internet etiquette, as they grow. These values may include: opportunity, education, culture, democracy, human services, equality within the economy, information, sustainability, and communication. An online community&#x27;s purpose is to serve as a common ground for people who share the same interests.

Online communities may be used as calendars to keep up with events such as upcoming gatherings or sporting events. They also form around activities and hobbies. Many online communities relating to health care help inform, advise, and support patients and their families. Students can take classes online and they may communicate with their professors and peers online. Businesses have also started using online communities to communicate with their customers about their products and services as well as to share information about the business. Other online communities allow a wide variety of professionals to come together to share thoughts, ideas and theories.

Fandom is an example of what online communities can evolve into. Online communities have grown in influence in &quot;shaping the phenomena around which they organize&quot; according to Nancy K. Baym&#x27;s work. She says that: &quot;More than any other commercial sector, the popular culture industry relies on online communities to publicize and provide testimonials for their products.&quot; The strength of the online community&#x27;s power is displayed through the season 3 premiere of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot;. Online activity by fans seem to have had a noticeable influence on the plot and direction of the season opening episode. Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; recounts how fans have, to a degree, directed the outcome of the events of the episode. He says that &quot;Sherlock has always been one of the most web-aware shows, among the first to find a satisfying way of representing electronic chatter on-screen.&quot; Fan communities in platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit around sports, actors, and musicians have become powerful communities both culturally and politically.

Discussions where members may post their feedback are essential in the development of an online community. Online communities may encourage individuals to come together to teach and learn from one another. They may encourage learners to discuss and learn about real-world problems and situations, as well as to focus on such things as teamwork, collaborative thinking and personal experiences.

===Blogs===
Blogs are among the major platforms on which online communities form. Blogging practices include microblogging, where the amount of information in a single element is smaller, and liveblogging, in which an ongoing event is blogged about in real time.

The ease and convenience of blogging has allowed for its growth. Major blogging platforms include Twitter and Tumblr, which combine social media and blogging, as well as platforms such as WordPress, which allow content to be hosted on their own servers but also permit users to download, install, and modify the software on their own servers. 23.1% of the top 10 million websites are either hosted on or run WordPress.

===Forums===
Internet forums, sometimes called bulletin boards, are websites which allow users to post topics also known as threads for discussion with other users able to reply creating a conversation. Forums follow a hierarchical structure of categories, with many popular forum software platforms categorising forums depending on their purpose, and allowing forum administrators to create subforums within their platform. With time more advanced features have been added into forums; the ability to attach files, embed YouTube videos, and send private messages is now commonplace. the largest forum Gaia Online contained over 2 billion posts.

Members are commonly assigned into user groups which control their access rights and permissions. Common access levels include the following:
* User: A standard account with the ability to create topics and reply.
* Moderator: Moderators are typically tasked with the daily administration tasks such as answering user queries, dealing with rule-breaking posts, and the moving, editing or deletion of topics or posts.
* Administrator: Administrators deal with the forum strategy including the implementation of new features alongside more technical tasks such as server maintenance.

===Social networks===
Social networks are platforms allowing users to set up their own profile and build connections with like minded people who pursue similar interests through interaction. The first traceable example of such a site is SixDegrees.com, set up in 1997, which included a friends list and the ability to send messages to members linked to friends and see other users associations. For much of the 21st century, the popularity of such networks has been growing. Friendster was the first social network to gain mass media attention; however, by 2004 it had been overtaken in popularity by Myspace, which in turn was later overtaken by Facebook. In 2013, Facebook attracted 1.23 billion monthly users, rising from 145 million in 2008. Facebook was the first social network to surpass 1 billion registered accounts, and by 2020, had more than 2.7 billion active users. Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, also owns three other leading platforms for online communities: Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger.

Most top-ranked social networks originate in the United States, but European services like VK, Japanese platform LINE, or Chinese social networks WeChat, QQ or video-sharing app Douyin (internationally known as TikTok) have also garnered appeal in their respective regions.

Current trends focus around the increased use of mobile devices when using social networks. Statistics from Statista show that, in 2013, 97.9 million users accessed social networks from a mobile device in the United States.

==Classification==
Researchers and organizations have worked to classify types of online community and to characterise their structure. For example, it is important to know the security, access, and technology requirements of a given type of community as it may evolve from an open to a private and regulated forum. It has been argued that the technical aspects of online communities, such as whether pages can be created and edited by the general user base (as is the case with wikis) or only certain users (as is the case with most blogs), can place online communities into stylistic categories. Another approach argues that &quot;online community&quot; is a metaphor and that contributors actively negotiate the meaning of the term, including values and social norms.

Some research has looked at the users of online communities. Amy Jo Kim has classified the rituals and stages of online community interaction and called it the &quot;membership life cycle&quot;. Clay Shirky talks about communities of practice, whose members collaborate and help each other in order to make something better or improve a certain skill. What makes these communities bond is &quot;love&quot; of something, as demonstrated by members who go out of their way to help without any financial interest. Campbell et al. developed a character theory for analyzing online communities, based on tribal typologies. In the communities they investigated they identified three character types: 
# The Big Man (offer a form of order and stability to the community by absorbing many conflictual situations personally)
# The Sorcerer (will not engage in reciprocity with others in the community)
# The Trickster (generally a comical yet complex figure that is found in most of the world&#x27;s culture)

Online communities have also forced retail firms to change their business strategies. Companies have to network more, adjust computations, and alter their organizational structures. This leads to changes in a company&#x27;s communications with their manufacturers including the information shared and made accessible for further productivity and profits. Because consumers and customers in all fields are becoming accustomed to more interaction and engagement online, adjustments must be considered made in order to keep audiences intrigued.

Online communities have been characterized as &quot;virtual settlements&quot; that have the following four requirements: interactivity, a variety of communicators, a common public place where members can meet and interact, and sustained membership over time. Based on these considerations, it can be said that microblogs such as Twitter can be classified as online communities.

==Building communities==
Dorine C. Andrews argues, in the article &quot;Audience-Specific Online Community Design&quot;, that there are three parts to building an online community: starting the online community, encouraging early online interaction, and moving to a self-sustaining interactive environment. When starting an online community, it may be effective to create webpages that appeal to specific interests. Online communities with clear topics and easy access tend to be most effective. In order to gain early interaction by members, privacy guarantees and content discussions are very important. Successful online communities tend to be able to function self-sufficiently.

===Participation===
There are two major types of participation in online communities: public participation and non-public participation, also called lurking. Lurkers are participants who join a virtual community but do not contribute. In contrast, public participants, or posters, are those who join virtual communities and openly express their beliefs and opinions. Both lurkers and posters frequently enter communities to find answers and to gather general information. For example, there are several online communities dedicated to technology. In these communities, posters are generally experts in the field who can offer technological insight and answer questions, while lurkers tend to be technological novices who use the communities to find answers and to learn.

In general, virtual community participation is influenced by how participants view themselves in society as well as by norms, both of society and of the online community. Participants also join online communities for friendship and support. In a sense, virtual communities may fill social voids in participants&#x27; offline lives.

Sociologist Barry Wellman presents the idea of &quot;globalization&quot; – the Internet&#x27;s ability to extend participants&#x27; social connections to people around the world while also aiding them in further engagement with their local communities.

==== Roles in an online community ====
Although online societies differ in content from real society, the roles people assume in their online communities are quite similar. Elliot Volkman points out several categories of people that play a role in the cycle of social networking, such as:
*Community architect – Creates the online community, sets goals and decides the purpose of the site.
*Community manager – Oversees the progress of the society. Enforces rules, encourages social norms, assists new members, and spreads awareness about the community.
*Professional member – This is a member who is paid to contribute to the site. The purpose of this role is to keep the community active.
*Free members – These members visit sites most often and represent the majority of the contributors. Their contributions are crucial to the sites&#x27; progress.
*Passive lurker – These people do not contribute to the site but rather absorb the content, discussion, and advice.
*Active lurker – Consumes the content and shares that content with personal networks and other communities.
*Power users – These people push for new discussion, provide positive feedback to community managers, and sometimes even act as community managers themselves. They have a major influence on the site and make up only a small percentage of the users.

===Aspects of successful online communities===
An article entitled &quot;The real value of on-line communities,&quot; written by A. Armstrong and John Hagel of the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, addresses a handful of elements that are key to the growth of an online community and its success in drawing in members. In this example, the article focuses specifically on online communities related to business, but its points can be transferred and can apply to any online community. The article addresses four main categories of business-based online communities, but states that a truly successful one will combine qualities of each of them: communities of transaction, communities of interest, communities of fantasy, and communities of relationship. Anubhav Choudhury describes the four types of community as follows:

#Communities of transaction emphasize the importance of buying and selling products in a social online manner where people must interact in order to complete the transaction.
#Communities of interest involve the online interaction of people with specific knowledge on a certain topic.
#Communities of fantasy encourage people to participate in online alternative forms of reality, such as games where they are represented by avatars.
#Communities of relationship often reveal or at least partially protect someone&#x27;s identity while allowing them to communicate with others, such as in online dating services.

==Membership lifecycle==
Amy Jo Kim&#x27;s membership lifecycle theory states that members of online communities begin their life in a community as visitors, or lurkers. After breaking through a barrier, people become novices and participate in community life. After contributing for a sustained period of time, they become regulars. If they break through another barrier they become leaders, and once they have contributed to the community for some time they become elders. This life cycle can be applied to many virtual communities, such as bulletin board systems, blogs, mailing lists, and wiki-based communities like Wikipedia.

A similar model can be found in the works of Lave and Wenger, who illustrate a cycle of how users become incorporated into virtual communities using the principles of legitimate peripheral participation. They suggest five types of trajectories amongst a learning community:

# Peripheral (i.e. Lurker) – An outside, unstructured participation
# Inbound (i.e. Novice) – Newcomer is invested in the community and heading towards full participation
# Insider (i.e. Regular) – Full committed community participant
# Boundary (i.e. Leader) – A leader, sustains membership participation and brokers interactions
# Outbound (i.e. Elder) – Process of leaving the community due to new relationships, new positions, new outlooks

The following shows the correlation between the learning trajectories and Web 2.0 community participation by using the example of YouTube:
*Peripheral (Lurker) – Observing the community and viewing content. Does not add to the community content or discussion. The user occasionally goes onto YouTube.com to check out a video that someone has directed them to.
*Inbound (Novice) – Just beginning to engage with the community. Starts to provide content. Tentatively interacts in a few discussions. The user comments on other users&#x27; videos. Potentially posts a video of their own.
*Insider (Regular) – Consistently adds to the community discussion and content. Interacts with other users. Regularly posts videos. Makes a concerted effort to comment and rate other users&#x27; videos. 
*Boundary (Leader) – Recognized as a veteran participant, their opinions are granted greater consideration by the community. Connects with regulars to make higher-concept ideas. The user has become recognized as a contributor to watch. Their videos may be podcasts commenting on the state of YouTube and its community. The user would not consider watching another user&#x27;s videos without commenting on them. Will often correct a user in behavior the community considers inappropriate. Will reference other users&#x27; videos in their comments as a way to cross link content.
*Outbound (Elders) – Leave the community. Their interests may have changed, the community may have moved in a direction that they disagree with, or they may no longer have time to maintain a constant presence in the community.

=== Newcomers ===
Newcomers are important for online communities. Online communities rely on volunteers&#x27; contribution, and most online communities face high turnover rate as one of their main challenges. For example, only a minority of Wikipedia users contribute regularly, and only a minority of those contributors participate in community discussions. In one study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University, they found that &quot;more than two-thirds (68%) of newcomers to Usenet groups were never seen again after their first post&quot;. Above facts reflect a point that recruiting and remaining new members have become a very crucial problem for online communities: the communities will eventually wither away without replacing members who leave.

Newcomers are new members of the online communities and thus often face many barriers when contributing to a project, and those barriers they face might lead them to give up the project or even leave the community. By conducting a systematic literature review over 20 primary studies regarding to the barriers faced by newcomers when contributing to the open source software projects, Steinmacher et al. identified 15 different barriers and they classified those barriers into five categories as described below:
# Social Interaction: this category describes the barriers when newcomers interact with existing members of the community. The three barriers that they found have main influence on newcomers are: &quot;lack of social interaction with project members&quot;,&#x27;&quot;not receiving a timely response&quot;, and &quot;receiving an improper response&quot;.
# Newcomers&#x27; Previous Knowledge: this category describes the barriers which is regarding to the newcomers&#x27; previous experience related to this project. The three barriers they found classified into this part are: &quot;lack of domain expertise&quot;, &quot;lack of technical expertise&quot;, and &quot;lack of knowledge of project practices&quot;.
# Finding a Way to Start: this category describes the issues when newcomers try to start contributing. The two barriers they found are: &quot;Difficulty to find an appropriate task to start with&quot;, and &quot;Difficulty to find a mentor&quot;.
# Documentation: documentation of the project also shown to be barriers for newcomers especially in the Open Source Software projects. The three barriers they found are: &quot;Outdated documentation&quot;, &quot;Too much documentation&quot;, and &quot;Unclear code comments&quot;.
# Technical Hurdles: technical barriers are also one of the major issue when newcomers start contributing. This category includes barriers: &quot;Issues setting up a local workspace&quot;, &quot;Code complexity&quot; and &quot;Software architecture complexity&quot;.
Because of the barriers described above, it is very necessary that online communities engage newcomers and help them to adjust to the new environment. From online communities&#x27; side, newcomers can be both beneficial and harmful to online communities. On the one side, newcomers can bring online communities innovative ideas and resources. On the other side, they can also harm communities with misbehavior caused by their unfamiliarity with community norms. Kraut et al. defined five basic issues faced by online communities when dealing with newcomers, and proposed several design claims for each problem in their book &quot;Building Successful Online Communities&quot;.
# Recruitment. Online communities need to keep recruiting new members in the face of high turnover rate of their existing members. Three suggestions are made in the book:
#* Interpersonal recruitment: recruit new members by old members&#x27; personal relationship
#* Word of mouth recruitment: new members will join in the community because of the word-of-mouth influence from existing member
#* Impersonal advertisement: although the direct effect is weaker than previous two strategies, impersonal advertising can effectively increase number of people joining among potential members with little prior knowledge of the community.
# Selection. Another challenge for online communities is to select the members who are a good fit. Unlike the offline organizations, the problem of selecting right candidates is more problematic for online communities since the anonymity of the users and the ease of creating new identities online. Two approaches are suggested in the book:
#* Self-selection: make sure that only good fit members will choose to join.
#* Screen: make sure that only good fit members will allow to join.
# Keeping Newcomers Around. Before new members start feel the commitment and do major contribution, they must be around long enough in online communities to learn the norms and form the community attachment. However, the majority of them tend to leave the communities at this period of time. At this period of time, new members are usually very sensitive to either positive or negative evidence they received from group, which may largely impact the users&#x27; decision on whether they quit or stay. Authors suggested two approaches:
#* Entry Barriers: Higher entry barriers will be more likely to drive away new members, but those members who survived from this severe initiation process should have stronger commitment than those members with lower entry barriers.
#* Interactions with existing members: communicating with existing members and receiving friendly responses from them will encourage the new members&#x27; commitment. The existing members are encouraged to treat the newcomers gently. One study by Halfaker et al. suggested that reverting new members&#x27; work in Wikipedia will likely to make them leave the communities. Thus, new members are more likely to stay and develop commitment if the interaction between existing member and new members are friendly and gentle. The book suggested different ways, including &quot;introduction threads&quot; in the communities, &quot;assign the responsibilities of having friendly interactions with newcomers to designated older-timers&quot;, and &quot;discouraging hostility towards newcomers who make mistakes&quot;.
# Socialization. Different online communities have their own norms and regulations, and new members need to learn to participate in an appropriate way. Thus, socialization is a process through which new members acquire the behaviors and attitude essential to playing their roles in a group or organization. Previous research in organizational socialization demonstrated that newcomers&#x27; active information seeking and organizational socialization tactics are associated with better performance, higher job satisfaction, more committed to the organization, more likely to stay and thus lower turnover rate. However, this institutionalized socialization tactics are not popular used in online setting, and most online communities are still using the individualized socialization tactics where newcomers being socialized individually and in a more informal way in their training process. Thus, in order to keep new members, the design suggestions given by this book are: &quot;using formal, sequential and collective socialization tactics&quot; and &quot;old-timers can provide formal mentorship to newcomers.&quot;
# Protection. Newcomers are different from the existing members, and thus the influx of newcomers might change the environment or the culture developed by existing members. New members might also behave inappropriately, and thus be potentially harmful to online communities, as a result of their lack of experience. Different communities might also have different level of damage tolerance, some might be more fragile to newcomers&#x27; inappropriate behavior (such as open source group collaboration software project) while others are not (such as some discussion forums). So the speed of integrating new members with existing communities really depends on community types and its goals, and groups need to have protection mechanisms that serve to multiple purposes.

==Motivations and barriers to participation==

Successful online communities motivate online participation. Methods of motivating participation in these communities have been investigated in several studies.

There are many persuasive factors that draw users into online communities. Peer-to-peer systems and social networking sites rely heavily on member contribution. Users&#x27; underlying motivations to involve themselves in these communities have been linked to some persuasion theories of sociology.
* According to the reciprocation theory, a successful online community must provide its users with benefits that compensate for the costs of time, effort and materials members provide. People often join these communities expecting some sort of reward.
* The consistency theory says that once people make a public commitment to a virtual society, they will often feel obligated to stay consistent with their commitment by continuing contributions.
* The social validation theory explains how people are more likely to join and participate in an online community if it is socially acceptable and popular.

One of the greatest attractions towards online communities is the sense of connection users build among members. Participation and contribution are influenced when members of an online community are aware of their global audience.

The majority of people learn by example and often follow others, especially when it comes to participation. Individuals are reserved about contributing to an online community for many reasons including but not limited to a fear of criticism or inaccuracy. Users may withhold information that they do not believe is particularly interesting, relevant, or truthful. In order to challenge these contribution barriers, producers of these sites are responsible for developing knowledge-based and foundation-based trust among the community.

Users&#x27; perception of audience is another reason that makes users participate in online communities. Results showed that users usually underestimate their amount of audiences in online communities. Social media users guess that their audience is 27% of its real size. Regardless of this underestimation, it is shown that amount of audience affects users&#x27; self-presentation and also content production which means a higher level of participation.

There are two types of virtual online communities (VOC): dependent and self-sustained VOCs. The dependent VOCs are those who use the virtual community as extensions of themselves, they interact with people they know. Self-sustained VOCs are communities where relationships between participating members is formed and maintained through encounters in the online community. For all VOCs, there is the issue of creating identity and reputation in the community. People can create whatever identity they would like to through their interactions with other members. The username is what members identify each other by but it says very little about the person behind it. The main features in online communities that attract people are a shared communication environment, relationships formed and nurtured, a sense of belonging to a group, the internal structure of the group, common space shared by people with similar ideas and interests. The three most critical issues are belonging, identity, and interest. For an online community to flourish there needs to be consistent participation, interest, and motivation.

Research conducted by Helen Wang applied the Technology Acceptance Model to online community participation. Internet self-efficacy positively predicted perceived ease of use. Research found that participants&#x27; beliefs in their abilities to use the internet and web-based tools determined how much effort was expected. Community environment positively predicted perceived ease of use and usefulness. Intrinsic motivation positively predicted perceived ease of use, usefulness, and actual use. The technology acceptance model positively predicts how likely it is that an individual will participate in an online community.

==Consumer-vendor interaction==
Establishing a relationship between the consumer and a seller has become a new science with the emergence of online communities. It is a new market to be tapped by companies and to do so, requires an understanding of the relationships built on online communities. Online communities gather people around common interests and these common interests can include brands, products, and services. Companies not only have a chance to reach a new group of consumers in online communities, but to also tap into information about the consumers. Companies have a chance to learn about the consumers in an environment that they feel a certain amount of anonymity and are thus, more open to allowing a company to see what they really want or are looking for.

In order to establish a relationship with the consumer a company must seek a way to identify with how individuals interact with the community. This is done by understanding the relationships an individual has with an online community. There are six identifiable relationship statuses: considered status, committed status, inactive status, faded status, recognized status, and unrecognized status. Unrecognized status means the consumer is unaware of the online community or has not decided the community to be useful. The recognized status is where a person is aware of the community, but is not entirely involved. A considered status is when a person begins their involvement with the site. The usage at this stage is still very sporadic. The committed status is when a relationship between a person and an online community is established and the person gets fully involved with the community. The inactive status is when an online community has not relevance to a person. The faded status is when a person has begun to fade away from a site. It is important to be able to recognize which group or status the consumer holds, because it might help determine which approach to use.

Companies not only need to understand how a consumer functions within an online community, but also a company &quot;should understand the communality of an online community&quot; This means a company must understand the dynamic and structure of the online community to be able to establish a relationship with the consumer. Online communities have cultures of their own, and to be able to establish a commercial relationship or even engage at all, one must understand the community values and proprieties. It has even been proved beneficial to treat online commercial relationships more as friendships rather than business transactions.

Through online engagement, because of the smoke screen of anonymity, it allows a person to be able to socially interact with strangers in a much more personal way. This personal connection the consumer feels translates to how they want to establish relationships online. They separate what is commercial or spam and what is relational. Relational becomes what they associate with human interaction while commercial is what they associate with digital or non-human interaction. Thus the online community should not be viewed as &quot;merely a sales channel&quot;. Instead it should be viewed as a network for establishing interpersonal communications with the consumer.

==Growth cycle==
Most online communities grow slowly at first, due in part to the fact that the strength of motivation for contributing is usually proportional to the size of the community. As the size of the potential audience increases, so does the attraction of writing and contributing. This, coupled with the fact that organizational culture does not change overnight, means creators can expect slow progress at first with a new virtual community. As more people begin to participate, however, the aforementioned motivations will increase, creating a virtuous cycle in which more participation begets more participation.

Community adoption can be forecast with the Bass diffusion model, originally conceived by Frank Bass to describe the process by which new products get adopted as an interaction between innovative early adopters and those who follow them.

== Online learning community ==
Online learning is a form of online community. The sites are designed to educate. Colleges and universities may offer many of their classes online to their students; this allows each student to take the class at his or her own pace.

According to an article published in volume 21, issue 5 of the &quot;European Management Journal&quot; titled &quot;Learning in Online Forums&quot;, researchers conducted a series of studies about online learning. They found that while good online learning is difficult to plan, it is quite conducive to educational learning. Online learning can bring together a diverse group of people, and although it is asynchronous learning, if the forum is set up using all the best tools and strategies, it can be very effective.

Another study was published in volume 55, issue 1 of &quot;Computers and Education&quot; and found results supporting the findings of the article mentioned above. The researchers found that motivation, enjoyment, and team contributions on learning outcomes enhanced students learning and that the students felt they learned well with it. A study published in the same journal looks at how social networking can foster individual well-being and develop skills which can improve the learning experience.

These articles look at a variety of different types of online learning. They suggest that online learning can be quite productive and educational if created and maintained properly.

One feature of online communities is that they are not constrained by time thereby giving members the ability to move through periods of high to low activity over a period of time. This dynamic nature maintains a freshness and variety that traditional methods of learning might not have been able to provide.

It appears that online communities such as Wikipedia have become a source of professional learning. They are an active learning environment in which learners converse and inquire.

In a study exclusive to teachers in online communities, results showed that membership in online communities provided teachers with a rich source of professional learning that satisfied each member of the community.

Saurabh Tyagi describes benefits of online community learning which include:
* No physical boundaries: Online communities do not limit their membership nor exclude based on where one lives.
* Supports in-class learning: Due to time constraints, discussion boards are more efficient for question &amp; answer sessions than allowing time after lectures to ask questions.
* Build a social and collaborative learning experience: People are best able to learn when they engage, communicate, and collaborate with each other. Online communities create an environment where users can collaborate through social interaction and shared experiences.
*Self-governance: Anyone who can access the internet is self-empowered. The immediate access to information allows users to educate themselves.

These terms are taken from Edudemic, a site about teaching and learning. The article &quot;How to Build Effective Online Learning Communities&quot; provides background information about online communities as well as how to incorporate learning within an online community.

== Video &quot;gaming&quot; and online interactions ==
One of the greatest attractions towards online communities and the role assigned to an online community, is the sense of connection in which users are able to build among other members and associates. Thus, it is typical to reference online communities when regarding the &#x27;gaming&#x27; universe. The online video game industry has embraced the concepts of cooperative and diverse gaming in order to provide players with a sense of community or togetherness. Video games have long been seen as a solo endeavor – as a way to escape reality and leave social interaction at the door. Yet, online community networks or talk pages have now allowed forms of connection with other users. These connections offer forms of aid in the games themselves, as well as an overall collaboration and interaction in the network space. For example, a study conducted by Pontus Strimling and Seth Frey found that players would generate their own models of fair &quot;loot&quot; distribution through community interaction if they felt that the model provided by the game itself was insufficient.

The popularity of competitive the online multiplayer games has now even promoted informal social interaction through the use of the recognized communities.

=== Problems with online gaming communities ===
As with other online communities, problems do arise when approaching the usages of online communities in the gaming culture, as well as those who are utilizing the spaces for their own agendas. &quot;Gaming culture&quot; offers individuals personal experiences, development of creativity, as well an assemblance of togetherness that potentially resembles formalized social communication techniques. On the other hand, these communities could also include toxicity, online disinhibition, and cyberbullying.

* Toxicity: Toxicity in games usually takes the form of abusive or negative language or behavior.
* Online disinhibition: The utilization in gaming communities to say things that normally would not have been said in an in-person scenario. Offers the individual the access to less restraint ion culturally appropriated interactions, and is typically through the form of aggressiveness. This action is also typically offered through the form of anonymity.
** Dissociative anonymity
** Invisibility
** Power of status and authority
* Cyberbullying: Cyberbullying stems from various levels of degree, but inevitably is cast as abuse and harassment in nature.

== Online health community ==
Online health communities is one example of online communities which is heavily used by internet users. A key benefit of online health communities is providing user access to other users with similar problems or experiences which has a significant impact on the lives of their members. Through people participation, online health communities will be able to offer patients opportunities for emotional support and also will provide them access to experience-based information about particular problem or possible treatment strategies. Even in some studies, it is shown that users find experienced-based information more relevant than information which was prescribed by professionals. Moreover, allowing patients to collaborate anonymously in some of online health communities suggests users a non-judgmental environment to share their problems, knowledge, and experiences. However, recent research has indicated that socioeconomic differences between patients may result in feelings of alienation or exclusion within these communities, even despite attempts to make the environments inclusive.

==Problems==
Online communities are relatively new and unexplored areas. They promote a whole new community that prior to the Internet was not available. Although they can promote a vast array of positive qualities, such as relationships without regard to race, religion, gender, or geography, they can also lead to multiple problems.

The theory of risk perception, an uncertainty in participating in an online community, is quite common, particularly when in the following online circumstances:
# performances,
# financial,
# opportunity/time,
# safety,
# social,
# psychological loss.

Clay Shirky explains one of these problems like two hoola-hoops. With the emersion of online communities there is a &quot;real life&quot; hoola-hoop and the other and &quot;online life&quot;. These two hoops used to be completely separate but now they have swung together and overlap. The problem with this overlap is that there is no distinction anymore between face-to-face interactions and virtual ones; they are one and the same. Shirky illustrates this by explaining a meeting. A group of people will sit in a meeting but they will all be connected into a virtual world also, using online communities such as wiki.

A further problem is identity formation with the ambiguous real-virtual life mix. Identity formation in the real world consisted of &quot;one body, one identity&quot;, but the online communities allow you to create &quot;as many electronic personae&quot; as you please. This can lead to identity deception. Claiming to be someone you are not can be problematic with other online community users and for yourself. Creating a false identity can cause confusion and ambivalence about which identity is true.

A lack of trust regarding personal or professional information is problematic with questions of identity or information reciprocity. Often, if information is given to another user of an online community, one expects equal information shared back. However, this may not be the case or the other user may use the information given in harmful ways. The construction of an individual&#x27;s identity within an online community requires self-presentation. Self-presentation is the act of &quot;writing the self into being&quot;, in which a person&#x27;s identity is formed by what that person says, does, or shows. This also poses a potential problem as such self-representation is open for interpretation as well as misinterpretation. While an individual&#x27;s online identity can be entirely constructed with a few of his/her own sentences, perceptions of this identity can be entirely misguided and incorrect.

Online communities present the problems of preoccupation, distraction, detachment, and desensitization to an individual, although online support groups exist now. Online communities do present potential risks, and users must remember to be careful and remember that just because an online community feels safe does not mean it necessarily is.

===Trolling and harassment===

Cyber bullying, the &quot;use of long-term aggressive, intentional, repetitive acts by one or more individuals, using electronic means, against an almost powerless victim&quot; which has increased in frequency alongside the continued growth of web communities with an Open University study finding 38% of young people had experienced or witnessed cyber bullying. It has received significant media attention due to high-profile incidents such as the death of Amanda Todd who before her death detailed her ordeal on YouTube.

A key feature of such bullying is that it allows victims to be harassed at all times, something not possible typically with physical bullying. This has forced Governments and other organisations to change their typical approach to bullying with the UK Department for Education now issuing advice to schools on how to deal with cyber bullying cases.

The most common problem with online communities tend to be online harassment, meaning threatening or offensive content aimed at known friends or strangers through ways of online technology. Where such posting is done &quot;for the lulz&quot; (that is, for the fun of it), then it is known as trolling. Sometimes trolling is done in order to harm others for the gratification of the person posting. The primary motivation for such posters, known in character theory as &quot;snerts&quot;, is the sense of power and exposure it gives them.
Online harassment tends to affect adolescents the most due to their risk-taking behavior and decision-making processes. One notable example is that of Natasha MacBryde who was tormented by Sean Duffy, who was later prosecuted. In 2010, Alexis Pilkington, a 17-year-old New Yorker committed suicide. Trolls pounced on her tribute page posting insensitive and hurtful images of nooses and other suicidal symbolism. Four years prior to that an 18-year-old died in a car crash in California. Trolls took images of her disfigured body they found on the internet and used them to torture the girl&#x27;s grieving parents.
Psychological research has shown that anonymity increases unethical behavior through what is called the online disinhibition effect. Many website and online communities have attempted to combat trolling. There has not been a single effective method to discourage anonymity, and arguments exist claiming that removing Internet users&#x27; anonymity is an intrusion of their privacy and violates their right to free speech. Julie Zhou, writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, comments that &quot;There&#x27;s no way to truly rid the Internet of anonymity. After all, names and email addresses can be faked. And in any case many commenters write things that are rude or inflammatory under their real names&quot;. Thus, some trolls do not even bother to hide their actions and take pride in their behavior. The rate of reported online harassment has been increasing as there has been a 50% increase in accounts of youth online harassment from the years 2000–2005.

Another form of harassment prevalent online is called flaming. According to a study conducted by Peter J. Moor, flaming is defined as displaying hostility by insulting, swearing or using otherwise offensive language. Flaming can be done in either a group style format (the comments section on YouTube) or in a one-on-one format (private messaging on Facebook). Several studies have shown that flaming is more apparent in computer mediated conversation than in face to face interaction. For example, a study conducted by Kiesler et al. found that people who met online judged each other more harshly than those who met face to face. The study goes on to say that the people who communicated by computer &quot;felt and acted as though the setting was more impersonal, and their behavior was more uninhibited. These findings suggest that computer-mediated communication ... elicits asocial or unregulated behavior&quot;.

Unregulated communities are established when online users communicate on a site although there are no mutual terms of usage. There is no regulator. Online interest groups or anonymous blogs are examples of unregulated communities.

Cyberbullying is also prominent online. Cyberbullying is defined as willful and repeated harm inflicted towards another through information technology mediums. Cyberbullying victimization has ascended to the forefront of the public agenda after a number of news stories came out on the topic. For example, Rutgers freshman Tyler Clementi committed suicide in 2010 after his roommate secretly filmed him in an intimate encounter and then streamed the video over the Internet. Numerous states, such as New Jersey, have created and passed laws that do not allow any sort of harassment on, near, or off school grounds that disrupts or interferes with the operation of the school or the rights of other students. In general, sexual and gender-based harassment online has been deemed a significant problem.

Trolling and cyber bullying in online communities are very difficult to stop for several reasons: 
#Community members do not wish to violate libertarian ideologies that state everyone has the right to speak. 
#The distributed nature of online communities make it difficult for members to come to an agreement.
#Deciding who should moderate and how create difficulty of community management.

An online community is a group of people with common interests who use the Internet (web sites, email, instant messaging, etc.) to communicate, work together and pursue their interests over time.

===Hazing===
A lesser known problem is hazing within online communities. Members of an elite online community use hazing to display their power, produce inequality, and instill loyalty into newcomers. While online hazing does not inflict physical duress, &quot;the status values of domination and subordination are just as effectively transmitted&quot;. Elite members of the in-group may haze by employing derogatory terms to refer to newcomers, using deception or playing mind games, or participating in intimidation, among other activities.

&quot;[T]hrough hazing, established members tell newcomers that they must be able to tolerate a certain level of aggressiveness, grossness, and obnoxiousness in order to fit in and be accepted by the BlueSky community&quot;.

===Privacy===
Online communities like social networking websites have a very unclear distinction between private and public information. For most social networks, users have to give personal information to add to their profiles. Usually, users can control what type of information other people in the online community can access based on the users familiarity with the people or the users level of comfort. These limitations are known as &quot;privacy settings&quot;. Privacy settings bring up the question of how privacy settings and terms of service affect the expectation of privacy in social media. After all, the purpose of an online community is to share a common space with one another. Furthermore, it is hard to take legal action when a user feels that his or her privacy has been invaded because he or she technically knew what the online community entailed. Creator of the social networking site Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, noticed a change in users&#x27; behavior from when he first initiated Facebook. It seemed that &quot;society&#x27;s willingness to share has created an environment where privacy concerns are less important to users of social networks today than they were when social networking began&quot;. However even though a user might keep his or her personal information private, his or her activity is open to the whole web to access. When a user posts information to a site or comments or responds to information posted by others, social networking sites create a tracking record of the user&#x27;s activity. Platforms such as Google and Facebook collect massive amounts of this user data through their surveillance infrastructures.

Internet privacy relates to the transmission and storage of a person&#x27;s data and their right to anonymity whilst online with the UN in 2013 adopting online privacy as a human right by a unanimous vote. Many websites allow users to sign up with a username which need not be their actual name which allows a level of anonymity, in some cases such as the infamous imageboard 4chan users of the site do not need an account to engage with discussions. However, in these cases depending on the detail of information about a person posted it can still be possible to work out a users identity.

Even when a person takes measures to protect their anonymity and privacy revelations by Edward Snowden a former contractor at the Central Intelligence Agency about mass surveillance programs conducted by the US intelligence services involving the mass collection of data on both domestic and international users of popular websites including Facebook and YouTube as well as the collection of information straight from fiber cables without consent appear to show individuals privacy is not always respected. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg publicly stated that the company had not been informed of any such programs and only handed over individual users data when required by law implying that if the allegations are true that the data harvested had been done so without the company&#x27;s consent.

The growing popularity of social networks where a user using their real name is the norm also brings a new challenge with one survey of 2,303 managers finding 37% investigated candidates social media activity during the hiring process with a study showing 1 in 10 job application rejections for those aged 16 to 34 could be due to social media checks.

===Reliability of information===
Web communities can be an easy and useful tool to access information. However, the information contained as well as the users&#x27; credentials cannot always be trusted, with the internet giving a relatively anonymous medium for some to fraudulently claim anything from their qualifications or where they live to, in rare cases, pretending to be a specific person. Malicious fake accounts created with the aim of defrauding victims out of money has become more high-profile with four men sentenced to between 8 years and 46 weeks for defrauding 12 women out of £250,000 using fake accounts on a dating website. In relation to accuracy one survey based on Wikipedia that evaluated 50 articles found that 24% contained inaccuracies, while in most cases the consequence might just be the spread of misinformation in areas such as health the consequences can be far more damaging leading to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration providing help on evaluating health information on the web.

===Imbalance===

The 1% rule states that within an online community as a rule of thumb only 1% of users actively contribute to creating content. Other variations also exist such as the 1-9-90 rule (1% post and create; 9% share, like, comment; 90% view-only) when taking editing into account. This raises problems for online communities with most users only interested in the information such a community might contain rather than having an interest in actively contributing which can lead to staleness in information and community decline. This has led such communities which rely on user editing of content to promote users into becoming active contributors as well as retention of such existing members through projects such as the Wikimedia Account Creation Improvement Project.

==Legal issues==

In the US, two of the most important laws dealing with legal issues of online communities, especially social networking sites are Section 512c of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Section 512c removes liability for copyright infringement from sites that let users post content, so long as there is a way by which the copyright owner can request the removal of infringing content. The website may not receive any financial benefit from the infringing activities.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives protection from any liability as a result from the publication provided by another party. Common issues include defamation, but many courts have expanded it to include other claims as well.

Online communities of various kinds (social networking sites, blogs, media sharing sites, etc.) are posing new challenges for all levels of law enforcement in combating many kinds of crimes including harassment, identity theft, copyright infringement, etc.

Copyright law is being challenged and debated with the shift in how individuals now disseminate their intellectual property. Individuals come together via online communities in collaborative efforts to create. Many describe current copyright law as being ill-equipped to manage the interests of individuals or groups involved in these collaborative efforts. Some say that these laws may even discourage this kind of production.

Laws governing online behavior pose another challenge to lawmakers in that they must work to enact laws that protect the public without infringing upon their rights to free speech. Perhaps the most talked about issue of this sort is that of cyberbullying. Some scholars call for collaborative efforts between parents, schools, lawmakers, and law enforcement to curtail cyberbullying.

Laws must continually adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media in all its forms; some legal scholars contend that lawmakers need to take an interdisciplinary approach to creating effective policy whether it is regulatory, for public safety, or otherwise. Experts in the social sciences can shed light on new trends that emerge in the usage of social media by different segments of society (including youths). Armed with this data, lawmakers can write and pass legislation that protect and empower various online community members.

== Online Communities during ongoing SARS CoV 2 (COVID 19) Pandemic ==
When the ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) otherwise known as  COVID 19, pandemic began, online communities and digital space became increasingly important. Since the World Health Organization, other public health agencies, and governments mandated contagion efforts like social distancing and isolation, people needed information and ways to connect with each other. The waves of COVID 19 and the associated dangers and containment measures of the airborne disease led to increased feelings of anxiety, fear, stress, and loneliness. With stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures in place, those with access to social media and digital space were able to find community online. Access to technology is crucial for social interaction and relationship-building. 

Online communities during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic use digital space for three main reasons:

* Education: with schools and universities closed across the globe, most curriculum shifted online.
* Health: with healthcare facilities tending to the global health crisis, many practices use online appointments and meetings.
* Connection: social distancing and isolation containment measures led to people finding community and support online.

Education

Access to digital technology at the beginning of the pandemic became important when students, teachers, and scholars, many of whom had in-person meetings previously, were required to start social distancing or isolate. In order to continue with the education curricula and research plans, those with access to digital devices, used technology to connect to the internet. By using Zoom and other virtual platforms educators, students, and scholars alike were able to maintain social distancing while creating connections to learn about themselves and the world around them. Cairns et al. found in their virtual ethnography that students rely on online technologies to stay connected for school and social engagement activities. Students use a wide variety of technologies including ones for education, entertainment, daily tasks, and social networks and were either synchronous or asynchronous. Online communities are essential for maintaining social connection and educational endeavors.

Health

The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has led to an increased need for online communities and digital space for those who have preexisting medical conditions or those with post-acute sequelae or long-term health conditions after a SARS CoV 2 infection (Long COVID). Those people who are immunocompromised, disabled, elderly, or have health conditions like cancer, rely on online communities for information, solidarity, and support. Many of them depend on telehealth and social media in order to access healthcare and have connection in a socially-distant reality. 

People with these illnesses that place them at risk, have feelings of frustration with the medical and political systems, despair, and grief that are shared within the online health communities. For example, in their article, “Experiences of people affected by cancer during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploratory qualitative analysis of public online forums,” Colomer-Lahiguera et al. found that cancer survivors and people with cancer had specific concerns with healthcare, infection, logistical and safety measures, and economic impacts that come with job loss and financial burdens. Those with cancer faced challenges in adapting to the “New normal,” social behavioral change, and experiencing cancer. People with cancer also had different needs for advice that were either COVID-related in terms of risk, COVID-19 information, others’ experiences, and measures to take if infected, or Cancer-related such as treatment, managing symptoms and side effects, and suspecting cancer. Online health communities allow for those with heightened fears of infection or reinfection to have the ability to discuss adaptation challenges and strategies to avoid COVID 19. People with cancer and Long COVID are faced with similar challenges in how they access healthcare, how healthcare providers treat them, and how they manage their illness or disease. Online communities offer people with health conditions ways to support each other, learn preventative measures to avoid COVID 19 infections and reinfections, and find shared interests and symptoms.

Connection

Whether they use online communities to connect for educational and research purposes or join to find solidarity or worship, people use the internet to create and foster relationships with others during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. In the U.K., Bryson et al. found that virtual faith communities which had online services often created an intrasacred spaces where together physical sacred spaces and rituals with secular become linked together. Congregation members became more active in the faith rituals and preparations than before the pandemic began and the use of social media became an important facilitator of connection. As social creatures, humans crave interaction with one another and people who are social distancing in an effort to avoid COVID 19 infections and reinfections use online communities to find ways of connection.
