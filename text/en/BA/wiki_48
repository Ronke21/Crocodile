<text>Medway is a unitary authority area with borough status in the ceremonial county of Kent in South East England. It was formed in 1998 by merging the boroughs of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham, and is administered by Medway Council, which is independent from Kent County Council. The borough had a population of 278,016 in 2019. The borough contains the towns of Chatham, Gillingham, Rainham, Rochester and Strood, which are collectively known as the Medway Towns.

Medway is one of the boroughs included in the Thames Gateway development scheme. It is also the home of Universities at Medway, a tri-partite collaboration of the University of Greenwich, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University on a single campus in Chatham, together with the Medway School of Arts.

==Geography==
Because of its strategic location by the major crossing of the River Medway, the borough has made a wide and significant contribution to Kent, and to England, dating back thousands of years, as evident in the siting of Watling Street by the Romans and by the Norman Rochester Castle, Rochester Cathedral (the second oldest in Britain) and the Chatham naval dockyard and its associated defences.

The main towns in the conurbation are (from west to east): Strood, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham, and Rainham. These are traditionally known as the &quot;Medway Towns&quot;. Many other towns and villages such as Frindsbury and Brompton lie within the conurbation. Outside the urban area, the villages retain parish councils. Cuxton, Halling and Wouldham are in the Medway Gap region to the south of Rochester and Strood. Hoo St Werburgh, Cliffe, High Halstow, St Mary Hoo, Allhallows, Stoke and Grain are on the Hoo Peninsula to the north. Frindsbury Extra including Upnor borders Strood.

The southern part of the urban area is on the north slope of the North Downs, including the suburbs of Walderslade, Luton, Hempstead and Wigmore.

Over half of the unitary authority area is rural in nature. Medway includes parts of the North Kent Marshes, an environmentally significant wetlands region with several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Other similar areas of conservation include Ranscombe Farm on chalk grassland and woodland between Strood and Cuxton, with rare woodland flowers and orchids.

== History ==
The Medway area has a long and varied history dominated originally by the city of Rochester and later by the naval and military establishments principally in Chatham and Gillingham.

Rochester was established on an Iron Age site by the Romans, who called it Durobrivae (meaning &quot;stronghold by the bridge&quot;), to control the point where Watling Street (now the A2) crossed the River Medway. Rochester later became a walled town and, under later Saxon influence, a mint was established here. The first cathedral was built by Bishop Justus in 604 and rebuilt under the Normans by Bishop Gundulf, who also built the castle that stands opposite the cathedral. Rochester was also an important point for people travelling the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, which stretches from Winchester to the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury. The Pilgrims&#x27; Way crossed the Medway near Cuxton.

In Rochester, parts of the Roman city wall are still in evidence, and the city has many fine buildings, such as the Guildhall (today a museum), which was built in 1687 and is among the finest 17th-century civic buildings in Kent; the Corn Exchange, built in 1698, originally the Butcher&#x27;s Market; the small Tudor house of Watts Charity endowed by Sir Richard Watts to house &quot;six poor travelers&quot; for one night each; Satis House and Old Hall, both visited by Queen Elizabeth I, built in 1573. In Medway there are 82 scheduled ancient monuments, 832 Listed buildings and 22 conservation areas.

=== Naval and military history ===

The Royal Navy opened an anchorage dockyard in Gillingham (Jillingham Water) during the reign of Henry VIII, in 1567 the Royal Naval Dockyard was established in Medway. Although it is called Chatham dockyard, two-thirds of the dockyard lie within Gillingham. The dockyard was closed in 1984, with the loss of eight thousand jobs at the dockyard itself and many more in local supply industries, contributing to a mid-1980s Medway unemployment rate of sixteen per cent. It was protected by a series of forts including Fort Amherst and the Lines, Fort Pitt and Fort Borstal. The majority of surviving buildings in the Historic Dockyard are Georgian. It was here that , Admiral Lord Nelson&#x27;s flagship at Trafalgar, was built and launched in 1765. Sir Francis Drake learned his seamanship on the Medway; Sir John Hawkins founded a hospital in Chatham for seamen, and Nelson began his Navy service at Chatham at the age of 12. Other notable sea-faring and naval figures, such as William Adams, were raised on the Medway but apprenticed elsewhere. The river was further protected by such fortifications as Upnor Castle which, in 1667 in varying accounts says it was partly successful in thwarting the Dutch raid on the dockyard, or the commanding officer fled without firing on the Dutch.

Another warship built at Chatham that still exists is (a 46-gun &quot;Leda&quot; class frigate) laid down in February 1822, and launched 30 March 1824. She never saw active service and has been restored and is (as of 2005) preserved afloat in Dundee, Scotland.

On 25 November 1914 the battleship was moored at buoy number 17 at Kethole Reach on the River Medway. She was taking on coal from the airship base at Kingsnorth, on the Isle of Grain when an internal explosion (most likely the result of cordite charges stored alongside a boiler room bulkhead and failure to follow guidelines on the storage of shells) ripped the ship apart. In all, the explosion killed 745 men and 51 officers. Five of the 14 men who survived died later of their wounds, and almost all of the others were seriously wounded. There are mass and individual graves in Woodlands Cemetery in Gillingham for the &quot;Bulwark&quot;″s dead, who were mostly drawn from the Portsmouth area. The explosion could be heard from up to at Southend and Whitstable. In terms of loss of life it remains the second worst explosion in British history.

Less than six months later there was a second explosion. This time it was the &quot;Princess Irene&quot;. She was a 1,500-passenger liner built at Dumbarton in 1914 for Canadian Pacific. Before she could leave Britain she was commandeered for war service and became , and was used as a minelayer. After several trips she was back in the Medway for a refit when on the morning of 27 May 1915 a huge internal explosion tore through the vessel, shaking the ground for miles around and showering the surrounding villages with remains of bodies and debris. A total of 278 died, including 78 workers from nearby towns and villages. In one Sheerness street there were ten who died. A Court of Inquiry was held into the loss and evidence was given that priming of the mines was being carried out hurriedly and by untrained personnel. A faulty primer was blamed for the explosion.

The British Army also established barracks here; and the Royal Engineers headquarters is in Gillingham.

The Royal Marines also have a long association with Chatham. The Chatham Division was based in Chatham until the closure of Chatham Dockyard. A museum dedicated to the Royal Marines can be found close to the dockyard at the Royal Engineers Museum in Brompton. Founded in 1812, it moved to its current site in 1987. It was classed as Grade II listed on 5 December 1996.

=== Post-war development ===
After World War II, the Medway conurbation expanded to the south as areas including Walderslade, Lordswood, Hempstead and Wigmore were developed, aided by the construction of the M2 motorway in the 1960s.

The population of Medway is projected to increase to around 300,000 by 2028 according to 2013 projections. Medway Council foresees total investment on development to be in excess of £1 billion over a 20-year period from 2006.

As of 2019, the towns in order of population (approximate figures) were Gillingham (85,000 – not including Rainham), Chatham (78,000), Strood (40,000), Rochester (30,000 – not including Strood) and Rainham (25,000). The towns as a whole are expected to rise dramatically in residents as increased development and housing prices are considerably less than most of Kent and London, which is 30 miles away.

In 2004, Medway Council announced its development strategy for the Medway Waterfront area. The report set out a 20-year framework plan for the redevelopment of up to seven miles (11 km) of waterfront and surrounding areas along the River Medway. The project aims to create between 6,000 and 8,000 new homes and 8,500 jobs, against central government targets of 16,000 new homes and 23,000 new jobs for the Medway area as a whole.

Among the transport proposals set forth for consideration were a new bridge linking the Medway City industrial estate to central Chatham; the removal of Chatham&#x27;s gyratory system along with an associated relocation of the town&#x27;s bus station; remodelling of Strood&#x27;s one-way system; and the provision of new cycle lanes and park-and-ride services throughout the area.

Chatham&#x27;s ring road system was subsequently changed into a two-way system in September 2006 with the Sir John Hawkins flyover (pictured right in 2007) being closed before later demolition to make way for a new bus station at the end of 2008. The new bus station opened in October 2011.

Other recent and proposed developments include:

;Rochester riverside
In Rochester, a 74-acre (30-hectare) area of brownfield land between the river and the railway line is being developed with high-density housing. Up to 50 homes per hectare will be built. The site will also include a primary school, two hotels, business centre, health centre, cafes, restaurants, bars and various commercial units.

;Chatham centre and waterfront
Numerous developments are proposed for the Chatham area including widening and straightening Union Street, development and improvements to The Brook and new developments at Gun Wharf and Chatham Waterfront. One such development at Chatham Waterfront (the area between Rochester railway station and Chatham Dockyard) is The Quays, a mixed-use development comprising two 20-storey residential towers, designed by WilkinsonEyre architects.
;Medway Gate
A major development in Strood between Medway Valley Park and junction 2 of the M2 motorway, much of the Medway Gate development is inside a large abandoned chalk pit. The area has seen the building of over 400 homes since work began in 2006, including 125 affordable homes.

;Strood riverside
Redevelopment including new homes and a landscaped play area were completed in the 1990s, but there are plans to extend this development further along the river beyond Strood railway station with another 500 to 600 homes to be built, the waterfront developed with new recreational and leisure facilities, and access to the station, town centre and Medway City estate to be improved.

;Temple Waterfront
This 173-acre (70-hectare) area between the river and Morgan&#x27;s Timber yard in Strood (formerly a Templar farm) has plans for 600 homes to be built along with 161,458 square feet (15,000 square metres) of commercial space and a new two-hectare (4.9-acre) site for Morgan&#x27;s Timber.

== Governance ==
Throughout the 19th century, there had been proposals to join the Medway towns under a single authority. By 1903 moves began to take place: that year saw the creation of the Borough of Gillingham, to which, in 1928, the adjoining parish of Rainham was added.

In 1944, a Medway Towns Joint Amalgamation Committee was formed by the borough corporations of Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester, to discuss the possibility of the towns forming a single county borough. In 1948 the Local Government Boundary Commission recommended that the area become a &quot;most purposes&quot; county borough, but the recommendation was not carried out. In 1956 the Joint Amalgamation Committee decided in favour of the amalgamation and invited representatives from Strood Rural District Council to join the Committee. In 1960, a proposal was made by Rochester Council that the merger be effected by the city absorbing the two other towns, to safeguard its ancient charters and city status. This led to Gillingham Council voting to leave the committee, as it believed the three towns should go forward as equal partners. On 9 March, the committee held its last meeting, with the Chatham representatives voting to dissolve the body and those from Rochester voting against. The motion to disband was passed on the casting vote of the chairman, Alderman Semple from Chatham.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the City of Rochester, the Borough of Chatham and part of Strood Rural District were amalgamated to form the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. Gillingham remained separate. Under letters patent the former city council area was to continue to be styled the &quot;City of Rochester&quot; to &quot;perpetuate the ancient name&quot; and to recall &quot;the long history and proud heritage of the said city&quot;. The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979, the Borough of Medway was renamed as Rochester-upon-Medway, and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.

===Creation of modern borough===
The modern borough was created on 1 April 1998 as part of the 1990s local government reforms. The way the change was implemented was to create a new non-metropolitan district and a non-metropolitan county, both of which were called &#x27;Medway Towns&#x27;, each covering the combined area of the previous local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham. There is no separate county council; instead the district council also performs county council functions, making it a unitary authority. The district remains part of the ceremonial county of Kent for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty.

The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. The first elections to the new council were in 1997; it initially acted as a shadow authority to oversee the transition to the new system, before formally coming into office on 1 April 1998. With effect from that day, the incoming council changed the borough and non-metropolitan county&#x27;s name from Medway Towns to just Medway.

Since it was the local government district of Rochester-upon-Medway that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. The other local government districts with city status that were abolished around this time (Bath and Hereford) appointed charter trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty. However, Rochester-upon-Medway City Council had decided not to and as a result their city status was rescinded. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when they discovered that Rochester was not on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office&#x27;s list of cities. Medway applied for city status in the 2000 and 2002 competitions, but was unsuccessful. In 2010, it started to refer to the &quot;City of Medway&quot; in promotional material, but it was rebuked and instructed not to do so in future by the Advertising Standards Authority. Medway Council made a further bid for city status in 2012, when three cities were afforded the honour as part of The Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee civic honours competition. Ultimately Medway was unsuccessful with the eventual winners being Chelmsford (Essex), Perth (Perthshire), and St Asaph (Denbighshire).

=== Politics ===

The council comprises 59 councillors representing different wards. The party political breakdown of the council following the 2023 local elections is:

Parts of the unitary authority are parished, chiefly the rural areas. There are currently 11 parishes:
== Education ==

Medway operates a two-tier education system, with academic selection for admission to secondary schools determined by the eleven plus exam. There are a number of grammar schools located in the area, the other secondary schools in Medway being non-selective (apart from one faith schools and the school on the peninsula). There are also a number of private schools operating in the area. Medway is also home to the third largest home school population of children in the UK after the Isles of Scilly and Isle of Wight.

== Demographics ==

* Population: The population of Medway as measured in the 2001 Census was 249,488, of which 49% were male and 51% female. Most of the population live in the Chatham and Gillingham areas: 70,540 in Chatham and 99,773 in Gillingham.
* Unemployment: The closure of Chatham Dockyard cost some 20,000 jobs. In June 2005 local unemployment stood at 2.3% of the workforce, a total of 3,678 people. Many of the employed population of 160,000 people now work outside the district — especially in London, which has many transport links from Medway.

== Economy ==

This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Medway at current basic prices published (pp. 240–253) by &quot;Office for National Statistics&quot; with figures in millions of pounds Sterling.

== Culture ==
Medway&#x27;s cultural strategy is run by Creative Medway, a sector-led organisation drawing together business, cultural sector organisations and freelancers.

There are five theatres in Medway, two run by the council and three independent. The council theatres are the Central Theatre (966 seats hosting a variety of tribute acts) and the Brook Theatre in the Old town hall (400 seats hosting a variety of shows). The independent theatres are Medway Little Theatre (96 seats), The Oasthouse Theatre and Kings Theatre (110 seats).

=== Leisure and recreation ===
* Medway Park (formerly The Black Lion Leisure Centre) in Gillingham is a sub-regional sports centre with three indoor pools for swimming and SCUBA diving, gym, fitness centre, sports hall and squash courts. It includes the Jumpers Rebound Centre for trampolining. Medway Park has been upgraded for the Medway 2012 programme to secure local benefits from the London Olympics.
* The Strand Leisure Park in Gillingham has an open-air swimming pool on the banks of the River Medway as well as other leisure attractions including tennis courts and a narrow-gauge railway.
* Strood Sports Centre in has an indoor swimming pool, gym, sports hall, squash courts and an astroturf sports pitch.
* Gillingham has an ice rink, The Ice Bowl, home to a local ice hockey team, the Invicta Dynamos who play in the NIHL South Division 1.
* Gillingham F.C. are the main football team of the area. They play in Football League Two.
* John Nike Ski Centre – located in Capstone near Hempstead
* The Splashes Leisure Centre in Rainham, Kent has a swimming pool with indoor slide and a wave machine. It also has a small gym on the second floor.
* Medway Dragons Rugby League Football Club operate out the Royal School of Military Engineering sports facilities and Medway Park for Wheelchair Rugby League

== Transport ==
=== Roadways ===

Watling Street (the A2), the Roman road between the Port of Dover on the English Channel and London, runs through Medway. This route became particularly congested and led to the building of the M2 to bypass the Medway Towns to the south in the 1960s and was subsequently widened extensively at the turn of the 21st century. The A2 through the Medway Towns varies from single carriageway to dual carriageway to &quot;one way&quot; systems. In places it deviates from the original route of Watling Street.

The A2 leaves the main route (which bypasses Medway by either the Northern Relief Road — The A289 or the M2) at the Three Crutches junction. The road descends through Strood towards the river. During the descent, the road to Gravesend, the A226 joins. In Strood the High Street is bypassed by the one-way system to the north and south encircling the High Street. The A2 crosses the Medway via two bridges in a dual carriageway (see Rochester Bridge). One bridge is Victorian and in the position of the original Roman bridge. The second bridge is more recent and build upon the piers of the original London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) main line railway bridge (the Chatham Main Line uses the South Eastern Railway&#x27;s branch line&#x27;s bridge).

In Rochester the High street is bypassed to the north by the dualled Corporation Street. The A2 then crosses the high street, climbs Star Hill and follows New road by Fort Pitt / Jackson&#x27;s Field to bypass Chatham to the south (by the Station, via a flyover known as New Cut). As it approaches Luton it is a dual carriageway for a short stretch, where a major junction lies with the railway (Chatham Main line) passes overhead — this is known as Luton Arches. It then climbs Chatham Hill (to Gillingham) now has a separate bus lane. The A2 / Watling street traditionally bypasses central Gillingham which lies to the North. From the main road to Gillingham (Canterbury Street), the A2 is dual carriageway. Here the Northern Relief Road (A289) rejoins at the Will Adams roundabout. This is swiftly followed by the Bowater roundabout where the A278 Hoath Way leads to the M2 to the South, this is so named and distinctive because of the former paper mill Bowaters at this location that left a giant water tower. A large Tesco supermarket currently inhabits the site. As the road progresses into Rainham it becomes single carriageway again.

Connecting Medway with neighbouring Gravesend is the A226. This leaves the A2 on the hill above Strood. It is a single carriageway A road.

The A228 runs along the west bank of the Medway, through Strood. Intersecting the M2 at its second junction, crossing the A2 through the centre of Strood and meeting (and encompassing for a short stretch) the Northern Relief Road (A289). The road then carries on to the Isle of Grain. Throughout its passage through Strood it is single carriageway, but the stretches to the North are dualled partially toward Grain. The road to Grain was an accident black spot, this and increased traffic from the major port of Thamesport which is located to the north-west along the Medway Estuary prompted the construction of a new dual carriageway. The A228 Main Road to Ropers Lane project was provisionally approved by the government in December 2001. Design work started in March 2000 and in February 2004, contractors got under way with moving services such as water, gas and fuel pipes. This work was vital, as the pipes actually supply the Hoo Peninsula and the power station at Grain. The largest water main that was moved was 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter and the largest gas main 36 inches (914 mm). The road cost £19 million and is approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) long.

The A229 starts from the A2 at the junction at the top of Star Hill alongside Jackson&#x27;s Field / Fort Pitt, it follows City Way to the South where at Fort Horstead / Rochester Airport / Mid Kent College it meets the branch from Chatham (the A230 which starts at Chatham Station / New Cut). From here it continues south, becoming dual carriageway and meeting the M2 at its third junction, which also provides access with Walderslade. This road then proceeds down Blue Bell Hill (from the summit of the North Downs) to the county town of Maidstone and the M20.

The A278 Hoath Way links the A2 at Gillingham to its southern suburbs (Hempstead, Wigmore and Parkwood) to the M2&#x27;s fourth junction. It is dual carriageway throughout.

The A289 was built in the 1990s as the Medway Towns Northern Relief Road. Constructed in three stages, firstly it bypasses Strood with a dual carriageway from Three Crutches (M2 J1) to the A226 and the A228 (The Wainscott Northern Bypass). It then joins the A228 (as The Wainscott Eastern Bypass) — these two parts are dualled. A dualled link road leads to the Medway Tunnel to the Chatham Dockyard. Here it meets Dock Road (A231) that leads to Chatham. The A289 continues between northern Gillingham and the river, and then turns southwards through Gillingham Golf Course to rejoin the A2 at the Will Adams roundabout.

The A2045 is the A289&#x27;s counterpart, however it is largely unbuilt. The Medway Towns Southern Relief Road was proposed to link the (then) new developments to the south of Chatham (Walderslade) and Gillingham (Hempstead, Wigmore and Parkwood) with M2&#x27;s J3 and the A229 to the east and the M2&#x27;s J4 and A278 in the west. A single carriageway road was built south of Walderslade to access the Walderslade Woods and Lordswood developments. At the other end a small section was built to access the Hempstead development and its shopping centre. However, the key middle stretch was left unbuilt, a link road to central Chatham via Luton, the B2156 North Dane Way was also left incomplete with no road to link to. The removal of Medway from Kent (which the incomplete section would lay in) and the recent widening of M2 leaves the proposed project with little chance of completion in the foreseeable future.

=== Buses ===
The majority of local bus routes throughout Medway are centred upon the newly opened Waterfront bus station (replacing Pentagon bus station) in Chatham.
Most bus routes are run by Arriva Southern Counties, which took over the locally owned Maidstone &amp; District bus company in the 1990s. Other local bus companies including Nu-Venture provide certain services, some under contract to the local authority.
Buses are numbered between 100 and 199 for local services, with buses numbered in the 700s to show Kent County Council subsidised services including those to Walderslade and Bluewater Shopping Centre, and in the 600s for school bus services.

Bus links to London and other parts of the south east can be accessed via Bluewater Shopping Centre, near Greenhithe, which has extensive bus routes to London.

=== Coaches ===
Commuter coaches run from various parts of Medway to a selection of London destinations using the M2/A2. Operating companies include The Kings Ferry and Chalkwell Coaches.

National Express runs regular services from Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre, Chatham Waterfront bus station, and Chatham Maritime Universities to Gatwick Airport.

=== Railways ===

The Medway Council area has seven railway stations:

* Strood Station
* Rochester Station
* Chatham Station
* Gillingham Station
* Rainham Station
* Halling Station
* Cuxton Station

It is served by the Medway Valley line, the North Kent line and the Chatham Main Line.

The owners of the Thames and Medway Canal tunnel that linked Medway (specifically Strood) with Gravesend turned half their canal into a railway bringing the first rails to Medway. They were soon absorbed by the South Eastern Railway whose North Kent line linked Strood with Gravesend, Dartford, and then London Bridge. Subsequently, SER extended their branch from their main line to Maidstone to Strood — the Medway Valley line. Stations were built on the Medway Valley line for the villages of Cuxton and Halling.

A rival company, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, built a railway between Chatham and East Kent. Unable to secure a connection and running rights over the SER&#x27;s North Kent line they built their own main line to Bromley where they connected with the West End of London &amp; Crystal Palace Railway to gain access to London Victoria. This railway became known as the Chatham Main Line. It had stations at which was actually in Strood, Chatham and New Brompton which was renamed Gillingham. The line was extended through Rainham to the Kent Coast (Thanet and Dover).

In reaction to this strong rival the SER built a small branch alongside the LCDR over the Medway on a parallel bridge to a station in Rochester and a terminus called which was actually just outside Chatham.

The strenuous competition between the two companies resulted in their merger into the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1899. Subsequent rationalisation saw the closure of the LCDR&#x27;s station in Strood and the SER&#x27;s branch to Rochester and Chatham (although the bridge was retained and is used to this day).

Post World War I saw the big four grouping and the SECR was merged into Southern in 1923. This led to electrification of suburban services (750 V DC third rail) which by World War II had seen electric traction reach Gillingham on the Chatham Main Line and Maidstone West (via Strood and the North Kent Line) on the Medway Valley line.

Post war (1948) saw nationalisation into British Rail, which under its 1955 modernisation part saw the completion of Southern&#x27;s electrification efforts in Kent as a key target. Thus Rainham was reached as part of this programme. It also saw the extension of platforms on the Chatham Main Line to 12 cars, leading to the closure of two of Chatham&#x27;s four platforms. Rochester retained four platforms, while Strood and Gillingham kept three. Rainham had only two platforms until 2017 when an additional bay was created to facilitate new trains on through services to destinations north of London. These are scheduled to commence in May 2018. In December 2015, a new Rochester station opened replacing the original one. It has three platforms and can handle 12-car trains.

Extensive goods yards existed at Strood, Rochester and Gillingham. Strood had engine sheds, while Gillingham still has carriage depots. A freight branch to Chatham Dockyard also exists. The network within the dockyard has been extensively curtailed since the dockyard’s closure.

Rail services generally consist of North Kent Line services (to London Bridge and beyond — Charing Cross and Cannon Street) starting from Gillingham. The Medway Valley line receives a shuttle service up and down terminating at Strood for transfers to the North Kent Line, although some services run through to Tonbridge and even Gatwick. The main services are on the Chatham Main line, with stopper services from Faversham (i.e. they stop at local stations, running fast from Bromley) and fast services from Kent Coast (i.e. they run fast from Medway to London). Services are currently operated by Southeastern. 

The High Speed 1 line passes through the Medway Towns area, running parallel to the M2/A2 Trunk road. The completion of High Speed 1 has seen domestic services operating on the line, which includes a stopping service starting at Faversham running to Strood and Gravesend before joining the High Speed line at Ebbsfleet. From there it travels at high speed to Stratford International and St Pancras International, where connections can now be made with mainline trains to the north of England. The rail service is extensively used by the residents of Medway to commute into London.

=== Waterways ===
Although it is extensively used for leisure, the River Medway is not used for local transport purposes; however, cargo ships operated by Union Transport of Bromley still sail to the cement works to the south at Halling/Cuxton. Part of the closed Royal Navy base is now used as a cargo port and has Ro/Ro facilities; cargo that comes in ranges from paper pulp to dredged material, but this traffic only uses one of the three main basins. There is also a ship repair facility located in the basin. Thamesport, which is located on the edge of the Medway Estuary on the Isle of Grain, handles the shipping of containers and fossil fuels. Kingsnorth Power Station has coal shipped in from Dunkirk. Scotline also operates a fleet of coasters for the import of wood, and has a wharf on the River Medway. There is also a wharf on the river called Eurowharf, which deals with dredged material. In addition, there was a shipping company based on the river, formerly known as Lapthorn Shipping but then as Coastal Bulk Shipping, but it ceased trading at the end of 2008.

=== Air ===
There are two small airports. The first, Rochester Airport, is a &quot;grass strip&quot; used for leisure purposes. Stoke Airfield near Grain is used by microlights and light aircraft. For scheduled air travel, Medway residents can use Kent&#x27;s Lydd Airport (or Manston Airport until its 2014 closure), but these lack extensive passenger facilities or routes; thus, the main London airports are used instead in most cases.

* William Adams, the first Englishman to record reaching Japan, was born in Gillingham. The Japanese Shogun made him a samurai (warrior). He is significant to Medway because this has led to the twinning with Yokosuka and Itō, the latter being the location of the shogun shipbuilding sites most associated with William Adams.
* Charles Dickens lived in Medway; a museum was in Eastgate House in Rochester until its closure in 2004. A visitor attraction based on his works was located at Chatham Dockside until October 2016, when it closed.

<text>William Lewis Sharkey (July 12, 1798 – March 30, 1873) was an American judge and politician from Mississippi. A staunch Unionist during the American Civil War, he opposed the 1861 declared secession of Mississippi from the United States. After the end of the war, President Andrew Johnson appointed Sharkey as provisional governor of Mississippi in 1865.

==Biography==

===Early life===
William Lewis Sharkey was born on July 12, 1798, near Mussel Shoals in Sumner County, Tennessee. He was the son of Patrick Sharkey, an Irish immigrant, and his wife, &quot;the daughter of a German pioneer&quot;. He had two younger brothers, Jacob Rhodes Sharkey and James Elliott Sharkey. When William was six, he moved with his family in 1804 to Warren County, Mississippi. His parents died when he was young and he had to take care of his younger brothers. At age 17, he enlisted in the War of 1812 where he fought in the Battle of New Orleans. He was educated at a college in Greenville, Tennessee, and read the law as an apprentice with Edward Turner. In 1822, he was admitted to the bar in Natchez, Mississippi.

===Career===
In 1825, Sharkey moved to Vicksburg, where he formed a law partnership with John I. Guion. He was later elected for two terms in the Mississippi House of Representatives, where he served from 1828 to 1829. He served as the Speaker of the House in 1829.

He served briefly in 1832 as a circuit court judge before being elected to the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi (today the Supreme Court of Mississippi), where he sat as a justice for 18 years until his resignation on October 1, 1850.

Sharkey was appointed Secretary of War by then-President Millard Fillmore; however, he declined the position. He did accept a diplomatic appointment, and from 1851 to 1854, he served as US Consul in Havana, Cuba. While he was serving as Consul, he swore in William R. King as Vice President of the United States on March 24, 1853. This, which was permitted by a special Act of Congress passed on March 2, was, to date, the only occasion that an American vice presidential oath of office or presidential oath of office has been administered on foreign soil. King, who was suffering from tuberculosis, would die on April 18 two days after he arrived at his home in Alabama.

A member of the Whig Party, Sharkey was vehemently opposed to the secession of Mississippi in 1861. Throughout the Civil War, he remained a staunch Southern Unionist and, according to one source, was &quot;tolerated by his Confederate neighbors only because of his towering reputation as a jurist.&quot;

Governor Charles Clark appointed him in 1865 as a commissioner (along with William Yerger) to confer on behalf of the state with President Andrew Johnson. On June 13, 1865, Johnson appointed Sharkey the state&#x27;s provisional governor. Sharkey left office with the election of Benjamin G. Humphreys in October.

He was elected Senator in 1865 but was denied his seat by Congress.

===Death===
Sharkey died in Washington, D.C., in 1873. He is interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi.

==Legacy==
Sharkey County, Mississippi, located in the Mississippi Delta region, is named in his honor.

<text>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to preventing animal cruelty. Based in New York City since its inception in 1866, the organization&#x27;s mission is &quot;to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.&quot;

==History==


Following the creation of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in the United Kingdom in 1824 (given Royal status in 1840), Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on April 10, 1866, in New York City on the belief that &quot;animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans, and must be protected under the law&quot;. It is the oldest animal welfare organization in the United States. On February 8, 1866, Bergh pleaded on behalf of animals at a meeting at Clinton Hall in New York City. Some of the issues he discussed were cockfighting and the horrors of slaughterhouses. After getting signatures for his &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Animals,&quot; Bergh was given an official charter to incorporate the ASPCA on April 10, 1866. On April 19, 1866, the first anti-cruelty law was passed in NY since the founding of ASPCA, and the organization was granted the right to enforce anti-cruelty laws. In 1867, ASPCA operated its first ambulance for injured horses and began advocating for more humane treatment of animals such as horses, live pigeons, cats, and dogs. Early goals of ASPCA focused on efforts for horses and livestock, since at the time they were used for a number of activities.

In 1918, ASPCA veterinarians developed the use of anesthesia and as a result were able to work on a horse with a broken kneecap.
In 1954, ASPCA hospitals added pathology and radiography laboratories and programs. In 1961, ASPCA veterinarians performed their first open-heart surgery on a dog.

From 1894 to 1994, the ASPCA operated the municipal animal shelter system in New York City which euthanized unadopted animals. Starting in 1977, the ASPCA entered into a contract with the New York City Department of Health to receive municipal funding to operate the shelter system. The contract rendered the ASPCA increasingly reliant on government income rather than private donations, and subject to the effects of annual city budget appropriations. In 1993, the ASPCA decided not to renew its contract for operating the shelter system. Operation of the shelter system was transferred to Center for Animal Care and Control, later renamed Animal Care Centers of NYC, in 1995.

In 1996, ASPCA acquired the Animal Poison Control Center from the University of Illinois. In 2013, the ASPCA made a $25 million commitment to assist at-risk animals and pet owners in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, including a fully subsidized spay/neuter facility in South Los Angeles operated by the ASPCA and a campaign to encourage the fostering of local vulnerable kittens.

In 2014, ASPCA spoke out in support of New York City&#x27;s new mayor&#x27;s (Bill de Blasio) campaign to ban horse-drawn carriages in the city.

In 2014, ASPCA opened the Gloria Gurney Canine Annex for Recovery &amp; Enrichment (CARE) in NYC to house dogs brought by the NYPD to the ASPCA in connection with animal cruelty investigations. In 2014, ASPCA also opened the ASPCA Kitten Nursery in NYC to care for neonate and very young homeless kittens until they are appropriate for adoption.

In 2015, ASPCA acquired the Asheville, North Carolina–based Humane Alliance, now called the ASPCA Spay/Neuter Alliance.

In 2018, ASPCA established the ASPCA Behavioral Rehabilitation Center. Located in Weaverville, North Carolina, the Center provides behavioral rehabilitation to canine victims of cruelty and neglect. The center&#x27;s Learning Lab also disseminates rehabilitative aid and training to shelters around the country.

In 2019, ASPCA opened the ASPCA Community Veterinary Center in Liberty City, Miami, Florida, to provide subsidized veterinary services for an underserved community. It also took over responsibility for The Right Horse Initiative as an official program of the ASPCA in 2019.

In 2020, ASPCA opened the ASPCA Community Veterinary Center in the Bronx, New York.

In 2020, ASPCA launched a series of programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on pets, owners, and communities including free pet food for dogs, cats, and horses in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, and Asheville, grants to animal welfare organizations, emergency pet boarding services, a New York City COVID-19 Pet Hotline, and expanded stationary and mobile veterinary care.

In 2021, the Society opened the ASPCA Community Veterinary Center supported by the Alex and Elisabeth Lewyt Charitable Trust, in NYC.

As of 2023, ASPCA&#x27;s New York hospital was treating 9,000–10,000 patients annually.

In 2023, ASPCA began releasing an annual report that grades major grocery retailers in the United States on their policies around animal welfare, such as selling cage-free eggs and pork raised without gestation crates.

==Controversy==
An ASPCA fundraising commercial featuring Sarah McLachlan began airing in early 2007. By December 2008, it had raised more than $30 million for the ASPCA, becoming the organization&#x27;s most successful fundraising campaign. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the spot became known as &quot;The Ad&quot; in non-profit circles.

In 2021, CBS News reported that the ad misled donors, who believed that their financial contributions supported local SPCAs and animal welfare charities. The CBS News investigation focused on &quot;questions about whether the money is going where donors expect,&quot; reporting the ASPCA raised $2 billion for animal welfare between 2008 and 2019 and spent only $146 million in grants to local animal welfare groups. In response, a spokesperson for the ASPCA said that donors were aware that the ASPCA was not an umbrella organization for local organizations with SPCA in their names.

After the CBS News piece aired, two widely-shared posts on Facebook claimed that the ASPCA&#x27;s CEO was paid $600,000 annually, and that only three cents of each dollar donated were used &quot;for veterinary supplies and for transporting the animals&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; fact-checked the posts and found that based on ASPCA tax filings, 34.4% of the ASPCA&#x27;s budget was used for shelter and veterinary care, and an average of 75.1% of expenses were used to support its mission statement.

==Legislation and litigation==
In 2012, the ASPCA agreed to pay Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus $9.3 million to settle a lawsuit regarding the ASPCA&#x27;s false allegations of animal cruelty by the circus. Courts found that ASPCA activists had paid the key witness, a former Ringling barn helper, at least $190,000, making him &quot;essentially a paid plaintiff&quot; who lacked credibility. Edwin J. Sayres stepped down as CEO in 2012, and in 2013 longtime ASPCA staff member Matthew Bershadker was named president and CEO.

The ASPCA&#x27;s Government Relations, Legal Advocacy and Investigations departments work with state and federal lawmakers and engage in legislative and litigation efforts to secure stronger legal protections for animals.

Some of the animal welfare issues the departments work on include ending puppy mills and breed-specific legislation.

In 2019, the ASPCA sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for access to animal breeder inspection records.

ASPCA was among the animal welfare groups that supported the &quot;puppy mill pipeline&quot; bill in New York, which was signed by Governor Kathy Hochul on December 15, 2022. The law goes into effect in 2024 and will make it illegal to sell dogs, cats, and rabbits in pet stores in New York. The organization&#x27;s senior director of state legislation said the law is needed because many puppies are imported from other states where New York does not have jurisdiction to inspect the conditions in the breeding facility.

== National cruelty and field response ==

At the invitation of local agencies, ASPCA deploys to sites of large-scale animal abuse, animal neglect, natural disasters, or man-made disasters in which animals are at risk. Teams, including National Field Response, Legal Advocacy and Investigations, Forensic Sciences, the Cruelty Recovery Center, Relocation and the Behavioral Sciences team, engage in animal rescue efforts. They provide behavioral and medical treatment for the animals and support the prosecution of criminal cases with forensic science, evidence collection and analysis, and legal and expert testimony support.

Cases involving torture, killings and mistreatment of animals are some examples of cases handled by the ASPCA. A common example was displayed in the news in October 2008, when ASPCA was in charge of an investigation involving the slaughtering of a beagle that lived in the Bronx.

In 2016, ASPCA field deployment teams participated in a large animal cruelty rescue operation, rescuing nearly 700 animals from an unlicensed facility in North Carolina.

Other large-scale ASPCA rescues included providing emergency sheltering and assistance for approximately 1,300 animals displaced during the Joplin tornado in 2011 and assisting with the care of 367 dogs in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia in 2013, in what has been believed to be the second-largest dogfighting raid in U.S. history.

In September 2013, after many years of providing humane law enforcement services in NYC, the ASPCA and the New York City Police Department announced a collaboration to provide enhanced protection to New York City&#x27;s animals. In this partnership, the NYPD responds to all animal cruelty complaints throughout New York City, while the ASPCA provides medical and behavioral care for animal cruelty victims and provides legal and forensic assistance in the prosecution of cases. The ASPCA Community Engagement team also works closely with the NYPD to connect pets in need to services such as medical care, grooming and pet supplies.

In 2020, ASPCA also opened the ASPCA Veterinary Forensic Science Center in Gainesville, Florida, to assist law enforcement with animal cruelty investigations and prosecutions.

== Welfare of farm animals and horses ==
The ASPCA&#x27;s Farm Animal Welfare Program features a &quot;Shop With Your Heart&quot; campaign that guides consumers on making animal welfare-conscious food buying decisions including seeking out meat, egg, and dairy products certified by one of three credible animal welfare certifications, including Global Animal Partnership (GAP), and exploring more plant-based food options.

The ASPCA&#x27;s Right Horse Initiative is focused on increasing the number of successful horse adoptions in the U.S. and improving the number of positive outcomes for horses in transition as they move from one home, career, or owner to the next.

== Animal relocation ==
ASPCA works with other animal welfare organizations and rescue groups to relocate animals from areas with high rates of euthanasia in animal shelters to locations with higher adoption rates. Often, animals are moved from the southern to northern U.S. states. Animals may be transported using aircraft or vehicles, sometimes being relayed between transporters multiple times along the way. As of March 2022, ASPCA had a fleet of 18 vans used for transport. The organization relocated approximately 200,000 animals between 2017 and 2022.

==Behaviour rehabilitation centers==
ASPCA operates centers where dogs that have experienced abuse or trauma receive treatment and behavior rehabilitation before being cleared for adoption. As of 2022, the organization has committed $40 million to building and operating the centers, which are located in Weaverville, North Carolina, Columbus, Ohio, with another being developed in Pawling, New York. The Weaverville center opened in 2020 and was the world&#x27;s first clinic for treating dogs that have been severely traumatized. The concept was conceived in 2010 by two ASPCA behaviorists as a way to reduce the number of dogs that are euthanized in shelters for behavior issues. The organization piloted the program in 2013 at a temporary site in Madison, New Jersey and reported that approximately 90 percent of the dogs treated recovered enough to be adopted. In 2014, ASPCA purchased land in Weaverville where it built the center. As of July 2022, the Weaverville center had 35 full-time staff, and had rehabilitated 500 dogs since opening.

==Publications==

The ASPCA published &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot; magazine in the 1870s which became &quot;Our Animal Friends: An Illustrated Monthly Magazine&quot; in the 1890s. The magazine featured articles from well known authors of the day, including Louisa May Alcott and Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was renamed &quot;Animal Protection&quot; (1947–1977) and later became &quot;ASPCA Bulletin&quot; (1977–1981), &quot;ASPCA Quarterly Report&quot; (1981–1989), &quot;ASPCA Report&quot; (1989–1992) and &quot;Animal Watch: The Magazine of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&quot; (1993–2004). In 1964, Lloyd Alexander authored their history, &quot;Fifty Years in the Doghouse&quot; which was commissioned by the ASPCA.

Copies of the ASPCA&#x27;s magazine &quot;Animal Protection&quot; are digitized and stored at NC State University Libraries. The ASPCA currently publishes the &quot;ASPCA Action&quot; magazine.

<doc id="218783" wikidata="Q1473114" url="?curid=218783" title="USS Saratoga (CV-60)">
<text>USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (CV/CVA/CVB-60) was the second of four supercarriers built for the United States Navy in the 1950s. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was the sixth U.S. Navy ship, and the second aircraft carrier, to be named for the Battles of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War.

Commissioned in 1956, she spent most of her career in the Mediterranean, but also participated during the Vietnam War, receiving one battle star for her service. One of her last operational duties was to participate in Operation Desert Storm.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; was decommissioned in 1994, and was stored at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made to preserve her as a museum ship. The Navy paid ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the ship for dismantling and recycling. On 15 September 2014, ex-&quot;Saratoga&quot; arrived in Brownsville, Texas, to be scrapped. Scrapping was completed by early 2019.

==Construction and trials==

She was ordered as a &quot;Large Aircraft Carrier&quot;, hull classification symbol CVB-60, and her contract was awarded to the New York Naval Shipyard of Brooklyn, New York on 23 July 1952. She is the second of the four &quot;Forrestal&quot;-class carriers. She was reclassified as an &quot;Attack Aircraft Carrier&quot; (CVA-60) on 1 October 1952. Her keel was laid down on 16 December 1952. She was launched on 8 October 1955 sponsored by Mrs. Charles S. Thomas, and commissioned on 14 April 1956 with CAPT Robert Joseph Stroh in command. She was the first carrier in the US Navy to use high-pressure boilers.

==Service history==

===1950s===

For the next several months, &quot;Saratoga&quot; conducted various engineering, flight, steering, structural, and gunnery tests. On 18 August, she sailed for Guantanamo Bay and her shakedown cruise. On 19 December, she reentered the New York Naval Shipyard and remained there until 28 February 1957. Upon completion of yard work, she got underway on a refresher training cruise to the Caribbean before entering her home port, Naval Station Mayport in Mayport, Florida.
On 6 June 1957, President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower and members of his cabinet boarded &quot;Saratoga&quot; to observe operations on board the giant carrier. For two days, she and eighteen other ships demonstrated air operations, antisubmarine warfare, guided missile operations, and the Navy&#x27;s latest bombing and strafing techniques. Highlighting the President&#x27;s visit was the nonstop flight of two F8U Crusaders, spanning the nation in three hours and twenty-eight minutes, from off the West Coast to the flight deck of &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the Atlantic.

Also in 1957, &quot;Saratoga&quot; conducted Regulus guided missile tests. She was one of ten aircraft carriers configured to operate the turbojet powered subsonic guided missile and only one of six carriers to ever actually launch the missile (performing two test launches) providing the first United States Navy nuclear strategic deterrence force.

The carrier departed Mayport on 3 September 1957 for her maiden transatlantic voyage. &quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed into the Norwegian Sea and participated in Operation Strikeback, joint naval maneuvers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. She returned briefly to Mayport before entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs.

On 1 February 1958, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Mayport for the Mediterranean and her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet. From this date through 31 December 1967 she was to spend a part of each year in the Mediterranean on a total of eight cruises. The remainder of the time, she either operated off the coast of Florida or was in port undergoing restricted availability.

===1960s===
On the night of 24–25 May 1960, &quot;Saratoga&quot; collided with the German freighter &quot;Bernd Leonhardt&quot; off North Carolina. The freighter&#x27;s bridge and superstructure were damaged by the carrier&#x27;s flight-deck. The results of an investigation were never published, but repairs to the freighter, amounting to about 2.5 million German marks, were paid for by the U.S. Navy.

While deployed with the Sixth Fleet on 23 January 1961, a serious fire broke out in &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s number two machinery space which took seven lives. The fire, believed caused by a ruptured fuel oil line, was brought under control by the crew, and the ship proceeded to Athens, Greece, where a survey of the damage could be made. The ship continued on its patrol mission with reduced steam generation capability, returning to the U.S. as scheduled to offload its air group before going to repair.

After an extensive shipyard period in the second half of 1964, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed for the Mediterranean, arriving just before Christmas 1964. Ports visited over the next 6 months were Naples, Athens, Cannes, Valencia, Istanbul, and Malta. Another routine Med cruise was undertaken in 1966. The Med cruise from June to December 1967 was anything but routine. Immediately after entering the Med, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, where her medical facility was used to treat survivors of the Israeli attack on USS &quot;Liberty&quot;. Later on she was involved in a near collision with the cruiser , which cut across &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s bow during flight operations. &quot;Saratoga&quot; had messaged indicating that she was planning to turn to starboard. This would put &quot;Little Rock&quot; on the outside of the turn because &quot;Little Rock&quot; was on the port side. As the carrier indicated she was executing her turn, &quot;Little Rock&quot; increased speed to maintain position. Unfortunately, &quot;Saratoga&quot; turned to port, putting &quot;Little Rock&quot; across her bow. Fortunately there was little damage and no injuries reported. 

In January 1966 planes from the Saratoga rescued 5 survivors of Haitian Air Force DC-3 crash that killed four member of the United Nations mission to Haiti.

During the return voyage in early December 1967, &quot;Saratoga&quot; spent several days in a fierce Atlantic storm, which caused heavy damage to external catwalks on the flight deck, garbage chute, and boat sponsons. She arrived in Mayport on 6 December.

On 2 January 1968, &quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and an overhaul and modernization program which was to last 11 months. On 31 January 1969, she departed Philadelphia for Guantanamo, via Hampton Roads and Mayport, and extensive refresher training of the crew and air detachments.

On 17 May 1969, Armed Forces Day, she was the host ship for President Richard Nixon during the firepower demonstration conducted by Carrier Air Wing Three in the Virginia Capes area. On 9 July, she departed Mayport for her ninth Mediterranean deployment. Underway, a Soviet surface force and a passed in close proximity, en route to Cuba. Off the Azores on 17 July, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was shadowed by Kipelovo-based Soviet aircraft. They were intercepted, photographed, and escorted while in the vicinity of the carrier. She operated with Task Group 60.2 of the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean during September in a &quot;show of force&quot; in response to the large build-up of Soviet surface units there, the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines plane to Syria and the political coup in Libya. Numerous surveillance and reconnaissance flights were conducted by Carrier Wing Three aircraft against Soviet surface units, including the helicopter carrier , operating southeast of Crete. &quot;Saratoga&quot; operated in this area again in October because of the crisis in Lebanon.

===1970s===

&quot;Saratoga&quot; returned to Mayport and the Florida coast from 22 January until 11 June 1970 when she again sailed for duty with the Sixth Fleet.

On 28 September 1970, President Richard Nixon and his party arrived on board. That night, word was received that Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic had died; an event that might plunge the entire Middle East into a crisis. The intelligence and communications personnel of the &quot;Saratoga&quot; were required to supply the President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretaries of State and Defense with the essential intelligence information to keep them abreast of the deteriorating situation. The presidential party departed the ship the next evening, and &quot;Saratoga&quot; continued on patrol in the eastern Mediterranean until she sailed for the United States on 2 November.

From her arrival at Mayport until 10 March 1971, she was in a &quot;cold iron&quot; status. She then operated off the Florida coast until 7 June when she departed for her eleventh deployment with the Sixth Fleet, via Scotland and the North Sea where she participated in exercise &quot;Magic Sword II.&quot; She returned to Mayport on 31 October for a period of restricted availability and local operations.

===Vietnam War===

On 11 April 1972, &quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed from Mayport en route to Subic Bay, and her first deployment to the Western Pacific. She arrived in Subic Bay on 8 May and departed for Vietnam the following week, arriving at &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 18 May for her first period on the line. Before year&#x27;s end, she was on station in the Tonkin Gulf a total of seven times: 18 May to 21 June; 1 to 16 July; 28 July to 22 August; 2 to 19 September; 29 September to 21 October; 5 November to 8 December; and 18 to 31 December. She had been reclassified as a &quot;Multi-purpose Aircraft Carrier&quot; (CV-60) on 30 June 1972.

During the first period, &quot;Saratoga&quot; lost four aircraft and three pilots. On 21 June, two of her F-4 Phantoms attacked three Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s over North Vietnam. Dodging four surface-to-air missiles, they managed to down one of the MiG aircraft. &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s planes attacked targets ranging from enemy troop concentrations in the lower panhandle to petroleum storage areas northeast of Hanoi. On her second line period, she lost an F-4 to enemy fire northeast of Hanoi with the pilot and radar intercept officer missing in action. During this period, her aircraft flew 708 sorties against the enemy.
On 6 August, LT Jim Lloyd of Attack Squadron VA-105, flying an A-7 Corsair on a bombing mission near Vinh, had his plane shot out from under him by a SAM. He ejected into enemy territory at night. In a daring rescue by helicopters supported by CVW-3 aircraft, he was lifted from the midst of enemy soldiers and returned to the &quot;Saratoga&quot;. On 10 August, one of the ship&#x27;s CAP jet fighters splashed a MiG at night using AIM-7 Sparrow missiles.

During the period 2 to 19 September, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft flew over 800 combat strike missions against targets in North Vietnam. On 20 October, her aircraft flew 83 close air support sorties in six hours in support of a force of 250 Territorials beleaguered by the North Vietnamese 48th Regiment. Air support saved the small force, enabled ARVN troops to advance, and killed 102 North Vietnamese soldiers. During her last period on station, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft battered targets in the heart of North Vietnam for over a week.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; departed &quot;Yankee Station&quot; for Subic Bay on 7 January 1973. From there she sailed for the United States via Singapore and arrived at Mayport on 13 February 1973 where she joined the Atlantic Fleet.

===Return to Atlantic Fleet===
In the beginning of 1975, &quot;Saratoga&quot; took part in the &quot;Locked Gate-75&quot;, a NATO operation meant to contain the influence of the Portuguese Communist Party in Portugal after the Carnation Revolution. Along with several foreign vessels, she entered the Tagus River delta and anchored in front of the Presidential Palace of Belém.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; sailed from Mayport, Florida January 1976 for another Med cruise. On board her was VS-22 with the first deployment of the S-3A Viking anti-submarine aircraft. She also took part in operations during the Lebanon crisis in 1976.

On 3 October 1978, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed on another Mediterranean deployment returning on 5 April 1979. On 21 November 1978, &quot;Saratoga&quot; collided with the replenishment oiler while operating with the Sixth Fleet, during a refueling operation south of Crete, suffering minor damage and no injuries.

===1980s===
In March 1980, &quot;Saratoga&quot; embarked airwing CVW-3 and departed on their 16th Mediterranean deployment. Highlights of the deployment included major exercises with the battle group, and visits by the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Thomas B. Hayward, and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Thomas C. Crow. Then-commanding officer, CAPT James H. Flatley III, made naval aviation history on 21 June 1980 when he completed his 1,500th carrier arrested landing. To make the event special, Midshipman James H. Flatley IV, the Captain&#x27;s son, rode in the back seat.

On 28 September 1980, only one month after her return from deployment, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Mayport and headed north to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she underwent the most extensive industrial overhaul ever performed on any Navy ship. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was the first ship to go through the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul that would last 28 months. She conducted sea trials on 16 October 1982, and left Philadelphia with much fanfare on 2 February 1983 with her new nickname — &quot;Super Sara.&quot;

&quot;The Saratoga&quot; departed the Mayport Basin yet again for her 17th Mediterranean deployment on 2 April 1984.

&quot;Saratoga&#x27;s&quot; 18th deployment was anything but ordinary. After departing Mayport in August 1985, &quot;Saratoga&quot; steamed toward the Mediterranean for what was scheduled to be a routine deployment. But on 10 October, she was called into action. An Italian luxury liner, , on a pleasure cruise departing from Alexandria, was hijacked by terrorists from the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF). After tense negotiations and the killing of an American tourist, the hijackers went ashore at Port Said. Egyptian authorities made hasty arrangements for the terrorists to depart the country. They boarded an Egypt Air 737 jetliner at the Al Maza Air Base, northeast of Cairo. On orders from President Ronald Reagan, seven F-14 Tomcats from the VF-74 &quot;Bedevilers&quot; and the VF-103 &quot;Sluggers&quot; were launched from the &quot;Saratoga&quot;. Supporting the Tomcats continuously were VA-85 Grumman KA-6D air tankers and E-2C Hawkeye of VAW-125. Off the coast of Crete, the F-14s, without the use of running lights, eased up beside and behind the airliner. On command, the Tomcats turned on their lights and dipped their wings – an international signal for a forced landing. The E-2C Hawkeye radioed the airliner to follow the F-14s. Realizing they were in a &quot;no-win&quot; situation, the hijackers allowed the pilot to follow the Tomcats to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. One hour and 15 minutes later, the aircraft landed and the hijackers were arrested by the Italians after a disagreement between American and Italian authorities. Seven hours after the fighter jets were scrambled, all &quot;Saratoga&quot; aircraft returned home without a shot fired.

On 5 December 1985 &quot;Saratoga&quot; became the first aircraft carrier to dock pierside on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

On 23 March 1986, while operating off coast of Libya, aircraft from the carriers &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and crossed what Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi had called the &quot;Line of Death.&quot; The very next day at noon, three U.S. Navy warships crossed the same 32° 30&#x27; navigational line. Two hours later, Libyan forces fired SA-5 Gammon surface-to-air missiles from the coastal town of Surt. The missiles missed their F-14 Tomcat targets and fell harmlessly into the water. Later that afternoon, U.S. aircraft turned back two Libyan Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 fighter planes over the disputed Gulf of Sidra. Soon after, aircraft from the three carriers fought back in defense. A heavily armed A-6E Intruder fired Rockeye cluster bombs and a Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile at a Libyan missile patrol boat operating on the &quot;Line of Death.&quot; Later that night, two A-7E Corsair II jets attacked a key radar installation at Surt. At the conclusion, three Libyan patrol boats and a radar site were destroyed by Navy aircraft.

====Friendly fire shoot-down incident====
At 1550 EDT on 22 September 1987, an F-14 Tomcat, of VF-74 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia, operating from &quot;Saratoga&quot;, accidentally shot down a United States Air Force RF-4C Phantom II, of the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, out of Zweibrücken Air Base, West Germany, over the Mediterranean during a NATO exercise, &quot;Display Determination 87&quot;. Both RF-4C crew ejected and were rescued by a helicopter from the &quot;Saratoga&quot; within 30 minutes, suffering numerous injuries. The Tomcat pilot, Timothy W. Dorsey, was duly disciplined and permanently removed from flying status, but was recommended for promotion to rear admiral 25 years later. Dorsey also served for years as USA Discounters&#x27; general counsel and vice president, and has been the Virginia-based company&#x27;s public voice as it came under fire for its frequent targeting of service members in wage-garnishment lawsuits. 

Following &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s 19th Mediterranean deployment in June 1987, she was overhauled once again at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, at a cost of $280 million.

===1990s===

====Operation Desert Storm====
&quot;Saratoga&quot; along with embarked airwing CVW-17, participated in Operation Desert Storm, primarily in the Red Sea. Before the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, &quot;Saratoga&quot; suffered a loss of 21 crewmembers in a ferry boat accident off the coast of Haifa, Israel. During the war, &quot;Saratoga&quot; set what were at the time, several records. She completed six transits of the Suez Canal and completed approximately 11,000 aircraft launch and recovery cycles. Saddam Hussein claimed on Iraqi television that &quot;Saratoga&quot; had been sunk, along with several other Coalition vessels. On one occasion during the war, a missile, possibly a Scud, was launched in the general direction of &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the Red Sea, but it was either unguided, or launched on a hunch, as it was determined early in its flight path it would miss by more than .

The ship launched many flights in support of operations, including that of Scott Speicher, correctly assumed to be the first American casualty of the war.

Another &quot;Saratoga&quot; aircraft shot down was an A-6E Intruder. Bombardier/Navigator LT Jeffrey Zaun was paraded before cameras by his Iraqi captors, but was eventually returned to American forces and was able to return to the &quot;Saratoga&quot;.

&quot;Saratoga&quot;-based US Navy SEALs conducted the first wartime boardings of merchant shipping in the Red Sea in support of Operation Desert Shield.

====The TCG &quot;Muavenet&quot; incident====
During the fall of 1992, the United States, Turkey, and several other NATO members participated in &quot;Exercise Display Determination 1992&quot;, a combined forces naval exercise under the overall command of ADM Jeremy Michael Boorda of the United States Navy. The forces of participating nations were assigned to either of two multinational teams. VADM T. Joseph Lopez of the United States Navy led the &quot;Brown Forces&quot;, which included &quot;Saratoga&quot;, with Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8 embarked. The opposing &quot;Green Forces&quot;, including the Turkish destroyer minelayer , former , were under the direct control of Admiral Kroon of the Netherlands.

During the &quot;enhanced tactical&quot; phase of the training exercises, the Brown Forces were to attempt an amphibious landing at Saros Bay in the Aegean Sea against the resistance offered by the Green Forces. ADM Boorda ordered the units comprising each force to actively seek and &quot;destroy&quot; each other. Both task force commanders had full authority to engage the enemy when and where they deemed appropriate and to use all warfare assets at their disposal to achieve victory. Needless to say, all confrontations were intended to be simulated attacks.

While all the ships had a break (green period) and stationed off the coast, on 30 September 1992 the combat direction center tactical action officer (TAO) aboard &quot;Saratoga&quot; decided to launch a simulated attack on nearby opposition forces utilizing the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system. After securing the approval of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s commanding officer and the battle group commander, RADM Philip Dur, the combat direction center officer implemented the simulated assault plan. Without providing prior notice, officers on &quot;Saratoga&quot; woke the enlisted Sea Sparrow missile team and directed them to conduct the simulated attack. Certain members of the missile firing team were not told that the exercise was a drill, rather than an actual event.

As the drill progressed, the combat direction center officer (TAO) used language to indicate he was preparing to fire a live missile, but due to the absence of standard terminology, the responsible officers failed to appreciate the significance of the terms used and the requests made. Specifically, and at the direct order of the TAO, the target acquisition system operator issued the command &quot;arm and tune&quot;, terminology the console operators understood to require arming of the missiles in preparation for actual firing. The officers supervising the drill did not realize that &quot;arm and tune&quot; signified a live firing. As a result, shortly after midnight on the morning of 1 October, &quot;Saratoga&quot; fired two live Sea Sparrow missiles at &quot;Muavenet&quot;. The missiles struck &quot;Muavenet&quot; in the bridge, destroying it and the combat information center, killing five, including the commanding officer, and injuring most of the Turkish ship&#x27;s officers. Navy officials recommended that the captain of the aircraft carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; and seven other officers and sailors be disciplined for the missile firing, a recommendation which was followed through.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Saratoga&quot; was decommissioned at the Naval Station, Mayport, Florida, on 20 August 1994, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She was towed to Philadelphia in May 1995, then, upon deactivation of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in August 1998, to Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. There, she was first placed on donation hold, then her status was changed to &quot;disposal as an experimental ship&quot;, and finally she was returned to donation hold on 1 January 2000. While a hulk at Newport, ex-&quot;Saratoga&quot;, like her sisters, was extensively stripped to support the active carrier fleet. There was an active effort to make her a museum ship in Quonset Point in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. In April 2010 &quot;Saratoga&quot; was removed from donation hold and scheduled to be disposed.

Efforts in 1994–95 to establish the ship as a museum in Jacksonville, Florida failed to raise even half of the start up costs. Jacksonville civic leaders attempted to raise funds, but the fundraising campaign, &quot;Save Our &quot;Sara&quot;&quot;, fell short of the $3 million goal. Efforts were abandoned when startup costs increased from $4.5 million to $6.8 million. Officials had wanted to place the ship in downtown Jacksonville, on the St. Johns River along the Southbank Riverwalk.A major hurdle was competition with the National Football League, who had awarded the city the Jacksonville Jaguars franchise in November 1993. To secure the team as part of the agreement with the NFL, the city had to ensure a large financial commitment to fund re-building of the city&#x27;s stadium at a cost of $130 million during 1994. This severely limited the city&#x27;s available funding and support of the &quot;Save Our &quot;Sara&quot;&quot; effort to bring &quot;Saratoga&quot; back to her home port. The Jacksonville USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; Museum Foundation, Inc ceased operating in the summer of 1995.

On 8 May 2014, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that ESCO Marine, Brownsville, Texas, would scrap &quot;Saratoga&quot; for one cent. This was the minimum amount that could be paid for scrapping the ship. On 21 August 2014, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Naval Station Newport and made its way down Narragansett Bay to the Atlantic Ocean, en route to the Esco Marine ship recycling plant in Brownsville, Texas. The vessel arrived at the scrapyard on 16 September for final scrapping. Scrapping was completed by 31 March 2019.

Both of &quot;Saratoga&quot;&#x27;s anchors were reused on the 1998 commissioned, USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;.

<doc id="218786" wikidata="Q562057" url="?curid=218786" title="USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)">
<text>USS &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; (CV/CVA-31) was the 14th of the 24 s completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. She was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, the first one being named for John Paul Jones&#x27;s famous Revolutionary War frigate by the same name. Jones had named that ship, usually rendered in more correct French as &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, to honor Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, the American Commissioner at Paris, whose &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; had been published in France under the title &quot;Les Maximes du Bonhomme Richard&quot;.

&quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; was commissioned in November 1944, the last of the &quot;Essex&quot; class completed in time to serve in what would be the final campaigns of the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning one battle star. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was recommissioned in 1951 for the Korean War. In her second career she operated exclusively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role in the Korean War, for which she earned five battle stars, and the Vietnam War. She was modernized and recommissioned in 1955. She was decommissioned in 1971, and scrapped in 1992.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; (CV-31) was laid down on 1 February 1943 at the New York Navy Yard, being the first &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier to be built at the New York Navy Yard. She was launched 29 April 1944 by Mrs. John S. McCain, wife of Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. The ship was commissioned 26 November 1944, with Captain A. O. Rule Jr. as her first commander.

==Service history==

===World War II===
&quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 March 1945 to join the Pacific Fleet and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 April 1945. Following additional training in Hawaiian waters, the carrier joined TF 38 off Okinawa on 6 June 1945 with Carrier Air Group 91 (CVG-91) aboard. During 7–10 June she joined in the attacks on Okidaitōjima and then served with the 3rd Fleet during the air strikes against Japan from 2 July to 15 August. She remained off Japan until 16 September 1945 and after a short training period off Guam, proceeded to San Francisco, arriving 20 October. She left San Francisco 29 October and steamed to Pearl Harbor to undergo conversion for troop transport duty. From 8 November 1945 to 16 January 1946 she made trans-Pacific voyages, returning servicemen to the United States. She was thereafter generally inactive until decommissioning on 9 January 1947. She was mothballed at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington.

===Korean War===
The outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 called &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; back to active duty. She recommissioned on 15 January 1951 in an unmodernized state and joined TF 77 off Korea on 29 May and launched the first air strikes of CVG-102 on 31 May. &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; continued operations with TF 77 until 20 November 1951. The carrier reached San Diego in mid-December and on 20 May 1952 was off again to the Far East, this time with CVG-7. She joined TF 77 once more on 23 June and took part in the heavy strikes against the Sui-ho Dam on 24–25 June and the amphibious feint at Kojo from 12 to 16 October. She continued operations against North Korean targets until 18 December 1952 and then steamed to San Francisco where she arrived 8 January 1953. Her classification was changed from CV-31 to CVA-31 on 1 October 1952.

====Modernization====
&quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; then went out of commission on 15 May 1953 preparatory to modernization at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. She was one of three &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers to receive the SCB-27C and SCB-125 modernizations on one refit. &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; emerged from the shipyard with an angled and strengthened flight deck, enclosed &quot;hurricane&quot; bow, steam catapults, a new island, wider beam and many other improvements. She completed her conversion period 31 October 1955 and commenced sea trials in the Alameda-San Diego area. She was recommissioned on 6 September 1955 and began the first of a long series of 7th Fleet deployments on 16 August 1956 with CVG-21 embarked. CVG-5 reported aboard for the 1957 deployment, before CVG-19 reported aboard for the next six deployments in 1958–1959, 1959–1960, 1961, 1962–1963, 1964, and 1965–66. The 1964 cruise included a voyage into the Indian Ocean. &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; also had been in the Indian Ocean for a goodwill trip to Bombay, India, at the direction of President Eisenhower during the 1959-1960 Pacific cruise.

===Vietnam War===
Admiral George Stephen Morrison, father of The Doors lead singer Jim Morrison, flew his flag on &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;. Popular myth has it that he had some involvement in the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August 1964, as he was the commander of the US naval forces present. Actually, the aircraft carrier involved in the incident was the . The Vietnam War escalation in early 1965 brought &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; into a third armed conflict, and she deployed on five Southeast Asia combat tours over the next six years. Her aircraft battled North Vietnamese MiGs on many occasions, downing several, as well as striking transportation and infrastructure targets. Occasional excursions to other Asian areas provided some variety to her operations. Carrier Air Wing 21 (CVW-21) joined the &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; for the 1967 deployment to Vietnam. CVW-5 was aboard again for the last three deployments in 1968, 1969, and 1970. &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; was ordered inactivated at the end of her 1970 deployment. She was decommissioned on 2 July 1971, becoming part of the Reserve Fleet at Bremerton. Adm. Morrison was the keynote speaker at the Decommissioning Ceremony on 2 July 1971 which was one day before his estranged son, Jim, died in Paris, France.

Following 20 years in mothballs, she was sold for scrap 4 February 1992. She was scrapped at Southwest Marine&#x27;s yard in San Pedro, California.

==Awards==
&quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; received one battle star for her World War II service, and five for the Korean War.
The &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; received three Navy Unit Citations (NUC): One NUC for actions during the Korean War; one NUC for actions during the Vietnam War in 1967 and a third NUC for actions during the Vietnam War in 1968. In 1972, however, the 1967 NUC was replaced with a Presidential Unit Citation (PUC) from President Richard M. Nixon. Therefore, the warship received a total of two NUC&#x27;s and one PUC.

<doc id="218787" wikidata="Q2468680" url="?curid=218787" title="USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6)">
<text>USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; (LHD-6) was a of the United States Navy commissioned on 15 August 1998. Like the previous five &quot;Wasp-&quot;class ships, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was designed to embark, deploy, and land elements of a Marine Corps landing force in amphibious assault operations by helicopter, landing craft, and amphibious vehicle, and, if needed, to act as a light aircraft carrier.

LHD-6 was the third ship of the United States Navy to bear the name first given by John Paul Jones to his Continental Navy frigate, named in French &quot;Good Man Richard&quot; in honor of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, the publisher of &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; who at the time served as U.S. ambassador to France.

On 12 July 2020, a fire started on a lower vehicle-storage deck while the ship was undergoing maintenance at Naval Base San Diego. It took four days for firefighters to extinguish the fire, which injured at least 63 sailors and civilians and severely damaged the ship. After a lengthy investigation into the cause of the fire, a sailor was charged with arson but was acquitted at trial. Repairs to the ship were estimated to take up to seven years and cost up to $3.2 billion, so the ship was decommissioned on 15 April 2021 and sold for scrap.

==Construction==
Ingalls Shipbuilding received the contract to build the ship on 11 December 1992 and laid down her keel on 18 April 1995. She was launched on 14 March 1997, delivered to the Navy on 12 May 1998, and commissioned on 15 August 1998.

===Cost===
The average cost of a &quot;Wasp&quot;-class landing helicopter dock (LHD) ship was estimated to be $750 million in 1989
($ billion in )
whereas the program unit cost of an &quot;America&quot;-class LHA (landing helicopter assault) was expected to be about $3.3 billion in 2015
($ billion in ).
In 2020, the cost of replacing the ship was estimated to be about $4 billion.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
===1998–2009===
&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; departed her building yard, Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton Industries, Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 8 August 1998, sailing into Pensacola Harbor at Naval Air Station Pensacola for commissioning activities and culminating with the main ceremony, which was held on 15 August 1998.

U.S. Representative John P. Murtha, of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th Congressional District, delivered the principal commissioning address. Then Secretary of the Navy, John H. Dalton, placed the new ship in commission. Congressman Murtha&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Joyce Murtha, served as Ship Sponsor and christened the ship at Ingalls in May 1997. During the commissioning, Mrs. Murtha gave the traditional order to &quot;Man our ship and bring her to life!&quot;

&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; participated in several operations. From 24 January to 24 July 2000, the ship made the first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment of any U.S. Navy ship in the 2000s as part of Operation Southern Watch. She deployed as part of Operation Enduring Freedom from 1 December 2001 to 18 June 2002.
Her next deployment was in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, beginning on 17 January 2003 and lasting until 26 July 2003. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; played two significant roles in Operation Iraqi Freedom; first, she offloaded more than 1,000 marines and gear from the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines into Kuwait. Second, after delivering her attack and transport helicopters, troops, and vehicles, she took up a position just miles off the coast of Kuwait and became one of two light aircraft carriers, or &quot;Harrier Carriers&quot;, along with in the Persian Gulf, launching AV-8B Harrier strike aircraft into Iraq. Pilots from Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211) and VMA-311, embarked aboard &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, expended more than of ordnance, providing close air support to the Marines on the ground and during predetermined strikes in Iraq. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; launched more than 800 sorties, including 547 combat launches.

&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; sailed to Sri Lanka to provide support for relief efforts following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis. On 4 January 2005, the ship helped airlift relief supplies to the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; deployed in Operation Unified Assistance from 5 January 2005 to February 2005. Her helicopters flew supplies and medical personnel into various areas of Indonesia and evacuated the wounded.

The following July, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2006. From 23 May to November 2007, she joined up with two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, and and their Carrier Strike Groups (CSG) off the coast of Iran to carry out previously unannounced air and sea exercises. In July 2008, the ship took part in RIMPAC 2008 off the coast of Hawaii.

From September 2009 to April 2010, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; deployed to the Fifth and Seventh Fleet Areas of Operations (AoR). Ports of call include East Timor; Phuket, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Oahu, Hawaii. In July, she participated in RIMPAC 2010 in the Kaulakahi Channel, between Kauai and Niihau Islands, Hawaii, near the Pacific Missile Range Facility.

===2010–2020===
&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; took the place of as the command ship for Expeditionary Strike Group Seven and switched homeport from San Diego, California, to Sasebo, Japan, on 23 April 2012.

During the summer of 2013 &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; participated in Exercise Talisman Sabre 2013. Maneuvers were performed off Queensland, Australia, and in the Coral Sea. After the exercise, the ship sailed for Sydney, arriving on 16 August 2013.

&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; assisted in the air-sea rescue operation of the capsized South Korean ferry MV &quot;Sewol&quot; with helicopters on 16 April 2014.

&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; participated in Exercise Talisman Saber 2017 involving more than 33,000 Australian and U.S. troops in June 2017. Alongside &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, 20 other ships and over 200 aircraft took part in what was Australia&#x27;s largest exercise to date. A week-long port call in Melbourne followed.

==== 2017 Osprey crash ====
On 5 August 2017, a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit took off from &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; and then crashed in Shoalwater Bay on the east coast of Australia. Twenty-three personnel were rescued, while three died, their bodies being recovered about three weeks later.

On 8 May 2018 &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; completed her homeport change to San Diego.

=== July 2020 fire ===
Witnesses reported that an explosion occurred at about 8:50 a.m. on 12 July 2020 aboard &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; while in her homeport at Naval Base San Diego undergoing maintenance. The resulting fire was fueled by paper, cloth, rags, or other materials, not fuel oil or other hazardous materials, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, told reporters that evening. Since the ship was in maintenance, on-board fire-suppression systems had been disabled, delaying the onset of firefighting efforts, according to Admiral Sobeck. The fire was reported to have started in an area that is normally used to park military trucks while the ship is at sea, but where shipyard workers might have temporarily placed other items including combustible materials.

The day the fire erupted, seventeen sailors and four civilians were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; all but five were released by the morning of the next day, Navy officials said. By 14 July, the number of injured had risen to 61, as more people were treated for minor injuries, including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.

On 16 July, five days after the explosion, the Navy announced that all fires had been extinguished. The minor injury total had risen to 63 total (40 sailors and 23 civilians). Admiral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, said the event was &quot;a very, very serious incident&quot; and that the Navy would address any systemic problems. He said the firefighting efforts had involved sailors from many ships and units in San Diego, including the helicopter squadron HSC-3, which dropped water on the ship. Eight sailors assigned to &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; were meritoriously promoted in rank on 31 July for their actions in fighting the fire.

Fire and water damage were sustained on 11 of 14 decks. Sections of the flight deck and other decks were warped and bulging, while the island was nearly gutted. The Navy removed the aft mast of the damaged ship to ensure it would not collapse.

====Investigations and charges====
On 26 August 2020, news outlets reported that a sailor from the ship was being investigated for arson, but no motive had been identified, and no one had been charged. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), along with other federal agencies, continued to investigate.

 three investigations were ongoing related to the fire. Two investigations were being conducted by Naval Sea Systems Command: the first was a failure review board investigation of safety issues relating to ship design and structure, and how changes could prevent future fires from spreading through ships under similar circumstances; the second was a safety review related to the events and activities that occurred on the ship before the fire and their relation to existing navy policies and procedures; finally, an investigation into command issues was led by Vice Admiral Scott Conn, the commander of the 3rd Fleet. Fire-suppression foam could have been released, but was not, because of a lack of training.

On 29 July 2021, an unnamed sailor was charged by the NCIS with aggravated arson under Article 126 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and hazarding a vessel under Article 110 of the UCMJ. The sailor was the same unnamed suspect questioned in August 2020 by NCIS and other federal law enforcement agencies and was identified as Seaman Apprentice Ryan Sawyer Mays in an affidavit unsealed in August 2021. The next step in the process was an Article 32 hearing, the United States military equivalent of a preliminary hearing, to determine whether the case was strong enough to proceed to a court-martial.

A Navy report published in 2021 lists numerous deficiencies in leadership, firefighting training, and equipment that contributed to the loss of the ship. In his 3 August endorsement of the report, United States Pacific Fleet commanding admiral Samuel Paparo characterized the crew as &quot;unprepared&quot; and their training and readiness as &quot;deficient&quot; while calling out &quot;a lack of familiarity with requirements and procedural noncompliance at all levels of command.&quot; Navy fire safety protocols enacted after the 2012 loss of attack submarine in a similar fire were not followed, and &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;&#x27;s captain, executive officer, command master chief, and chief engineer were criticized for leadership failures that &quot;directly led to the loss&quot; of the ship.

The report emphasized poor communication and coordination between sailors and officers on the ship, firefighting teams on the naval base, teams assembled on nearby destroyers, and civilian firefighters. When the smoke was first noticed, sailors aboard &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; failed to promptly and accurately locate and report its source, partially because some sailors did not don firefighting attire and breathing equipment because they mistakenly believed that it could not be worn with their working uniforms. Firefighting hoses and fittings on the ship were broken or missing, and numerous hatches could not be closed to contain the blaze because temporary utility lines routed through them for maintenance work could not be easily disconnected.

On 16 July 2022, the Navy issued a letter of censure to retired vice admiral Richard Brown, commander of Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, at the time of the fire. The letter said that he had failed &quot;to effectively ensure appropriate levels of training and readiness in units under your command&quot;. In response, Brown complained that the Navy &quot;has abandoned me for political expediency&quot;. The Navy later issued letters of reprimand to other officers, including Captains Gregory Thoroman and Michael Ray, the former commander and executive officer and command master chief Jose Hernandez, the senior enlisted sailor aboard, for inadequate training, improper oversight and a failure to properly maintain equipment, all of which had led to the fire being as destructive as it was. The two officers also forfeited pay; they were among 20 sailors punished over the fire.

====Trial of the accused====
After an article 32 hearing, a trial date of 19 to 30 September 2022 was set for Mays, who, according to his civilian defense attorney Gary Barthel, continued to maintain his innocence of charges of aggravated arson and willful hazarding of a vessel. Barthel claimed that the legal officer who oversaw the article 32 hearing recommended to the head of the San Diego–based command, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, that &quot;the case not go to court-martial, and that the Navy is scapegoating Mays due to the high-profile nature of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; disaster.&quot;

Before the article 32 hearing, the accused sailor&#x27;s attorney stated that the portrayal of his client had been unfair and that he looked forward to proving that his client is innocent. Dozens of Navy officials, including several admirals, &quot;have faced disciplinary action for failures that investigators said prevented the blaze from being put out sooner.&quot; He said that there is &quot;evidence that the fire was started because of negligence and the improper storage of lithium batteries close to crates of hand sanitizer.&quot;

On 19 September 2022, Mays&#x27;s trial began at Naval Base San Diego. On 30 September after a two-week trial, a military judge acquitted Mays on both charges (arson and willful hazarding of a vessel).

===Disposal===
On 30 November 2020, Navy officials said that attempting to repair the damage and return &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; to service would take between five and seven years and cost an estimated $2.5 billion to $3.2 billion. Instead, the decision was made to withdraw the ship from service and, following extensive component recovery, have her sold for scrap. In February 2021, a bipartisan group of congressional delegates from Florida proposed that the hulk be sunk off the coast of Florida as an artificial reef, arguing that the reef would become an environmental and economic benefit to the area. After a decommissioning ceremony on 14 April 2021, she was officially decommissioned on 15 April. The same day, the hull was towed from San Diego, heading for a scrap yard in Texas. On 9 April 2021, International Shipbreaking Ltd. of Brownsville, Texas purchased the ex-&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; for $3.66 million for breaking and recycling.

The Marine Corps—in conjunction with International Ship Breaking Limited, Naval Sea Systems Command, Weapons Training Battalion and Method of Entry School (MOES)—salvaged 44 hatches and two hull sections, which will be used to teach marines special procedures for breaching watertight doors during Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) operations. It is estimated that the service has saved over $100,000 by salvaging these parts.

<text>An obligation is a course of action which someone is required to take, be it a legal obligation or a moral obligation. Obligations are constraints; they limit freedom. People who are under obligations may choose to freely act under obligations. Obligation exists when there is a choice to do what is morally good and what is morally unacceptable. There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of etiquette, social obligations, religious, and possibly in terms of politics, where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally legal obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a tradition or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child. Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual&#x27;s rights or power.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is , meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family Proteidae are obligate paedomorphs, whereas species belonging to the Ambystomatidae are facultative paedomorphs.

In finance, &quot;obligated&quot; refers to funds within authorised budgets which have become legally binding expenditure commitments e.g. through letting a contract.

In the Catholic Church, Holy Days of Obligation or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the Mass.

== Obligation and morality ==
An obligation is contract between an individual and the thing or person to which or whom they are obligated. If the contract is breached the individual can be subject to blame. When entering into an obligation people generally do not think about the guilt that they would experience if the obligation were not fulfilled; instead they think about how they can fulfil the obligation. Rationalists argue people respond in this way because they have a reason to fulfill the obligation. According to the sanction theory, an obligation corresponds to the social pressures one feels, and is not simply derived from a singular relationship with another person or project. In the rationalist argument, this same pressure adds to the reasons people have, thereby strengthening their desire to fulfill the obligation. The sanction theory states there needs to be a sanction in order for a duty to be a moral duty.

== Sociological view versus philosophical view ==
Sociologists believe that obligations lead people to act in ways that society deems acceptable. Every society has their own way of governing, they expect their citizens to behave in a particular manner. Not only do the citizens have to oblige to the societal norms, they want to, in order to assimilate to society. Some philosophers on the other hand, argue that rational beings have moral duties, they make a choice to either fulfill these moral duties or disregard them. They have a moral responsibility to fulfill their obligations. Duty is seen as the response to an individual&#x27;s obligations. Obligations require an action being done and duty is the carrying out of this action. Sociologists believe that an obligation is an objective force. Some philosophers however, believe obligations are moral imperatives.

== Types==

=== Written ===
Written obligations are contracts. They legally bind two people into an agreement. Each person becomes responsible for doing their part of the contract. A legal contract, which does not need to be made in writing, consists of an offer, an acceptance of that offer, an intention to bind to one another in a legal agreement and a consideration, something of value to be exchanged.

===Political ===
A political obligation is a requirement for the citizens of a society to follow the laws of that society. There are philosophical issues, however, about whether a citizen should follow a law simply because it is a law. There are various views about whether a political obligation is a moral obligation. John Rawls argues that people do have political obligations because of the &quot;principle of fairness&quot;. Humanity benefits from the joint effort of the government, so, in fairness, they should be active and supportive members of this effort. There are people, however, such as Robert Nozick, who argue enjoyment of a community effort does not mean obligation to that effort.

=== Social ===
Social obligations refer to the things humans as individuals accept because it is collectively accepted. When people agree to a promise or an agreement, they are collectively consenting to its terms. Humanity is obligated to fulfil that promise or agreement.

===Primary and secondary ===
English law distinguishes in some case law between primary and secondary obligations. A secondary obligation, also known as an accessory obligation, is a duty that is incidental to a primary obligation. A duty to perform a secondary obligation may result, for example, as a result of their breach of a primary obligation, or by another party breaching an obligation that the secondary obligor has guaranteed.

The England and Wales Court of Appeal noted in the case of AB v CD (2014) that and in relation to the Statute of Frauds, Lord Justice Maurice Kay commented in 2009 that

The Appeal Court observed in 1973 that the determination of whether a document is a guarantee or an indemnity, or whether it imposes a secondary or a primary liability, will always depend upon &quot;the true construction of the actual words in which the promise is expressed&quot;.

Under the Louisiana Civil Code, &quot;stipulated damages&quot; create a secondary obligation for the purpose of enforcing a principal obligation. An aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or the performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay.

<text>Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange ( ; born 11 November 1948) is a South African record producer. He is known for his work in rock music as well as co-writing and producing various songs for his ex-wife Shania Twain. Her 1997 album &quot;Come On Over&quot;, which Lange produced, is the best-selling country music album, the best-selling studio album by a female act, the best-selling album of the 1990s, and the ninth best-selling album in the United States. He has also produced songs for, or otherwise worked with, artists such as AC/DC, Def Leppard, The Michael Stanley Band, The Boomtown Rats, Foreigner, Michael Bolton, Heart, The Cars, Bryan Adams, Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Ocean, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, The Corrs, Maroon 5, Lady Gaga, Now United, Nickelback, and Muse.

== Early life ==
Robert John Lange was born in Mufulira, Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia), and raised in Durban, South Africa. His German mother came from a prosperous family, and his South African father was a mining engineer. Nicknamed &quot;Mutt&quot; at an early age, Lange grew up a fan of country music, in particular the singer Slim Whitman. While studying at Belfast High School in what is now Mpumalanga province, he started a band in which he played rhythm guitar and sang harmonies.

== Career ==
After his national service (1966–1967), Lange formed the band Sound Reason in 1969, together with James Borthwick, a South African TV, stage and film actor. In 1971, he started the group Hocus, recording one album and releasing five singles.

In 1978, Lange wrote and produced Ipswich Town&#x27;s FA Cup Final single &quot;Ipswich Get That Goal&quot;, his connection with the club due to their South Africa-born player Colin Viljoen. The song is derived from a previous recording, &quot;Give That Thang to Me&quot; by Paul Jones (1977), with some parts rearranged and new lyrics.

Beginning production work in 1976, his first major hits came in October 1978 with the UK No. 1 single &quot;Rat Trap&quot; for The Boomtown Rats, followed in July 1979 with AC/DC&#x27;s hard rock album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (No. 8 UK, No. 17 US). He produced a total of five albums for UK band City Boy from 1976 to 1979.

He produced two more albums with AC/DC, including &quot;Back in Black&quot; (1980) which is, , the second-best-selling album of all time. He also worked with rock group Foreigner on &quot;4&quot;, and with Def Leppard on their hit albums, &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, &quot;Pyromania&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot; and &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, co-writing most of the songs.

After &quot;Hysteria&quot;, Lange bowed out of working with Def Leppard. In 1999, he returned to working with them in a more limited role, co-writing three tracks for their album &quot;Euphoria&quot;, which spawned the single &quot;Promises&quot;, a Number 1 hit on the mainstream rock charts.

In 1991, he produced Bryan Adams&#x27;s &quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot;, including co-writing &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; for the Kevin Costner film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; which – with 16 consecutive weeks at the top from 7 July to 26 October 1991 – holds the record for the longest number of consecutive weeks at Number 1 in the UK singles chart. Lange produced the single &quot;Make You&quot; from the album &quot;Great Escape&quot; by Irish singer Tara Blaise which was released in May 2008.

In the 2001 television film &quot;Hysteria – The Def Leppard Story&quot;, actor Anthony Michael Hall portrayed Lange.

== Personal life ==
Lange is a strict vegetarian and a follower of the egalitarian teachings of Sant Mat. He has not given an interview for decades and prefers to live a secluded life, primarily in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland.

Lange met Stevie Vann when the two attended the same school in Northern Rhodesia in the early 1960s, and the two reconnected a few years later while attending Belfast High School in South Africa. They played together in a short-lived band named Hocus, and later married and emigrated to the United Kingdom in the 1970s. The marriage broke down in the 1970s. While married, Lange started a five-year relationship with Oonagh O&#x27;Reilly, an Irish-born co-worker. In 1979, he married actress Olga Anthony.

After hearing Shania Twain&#x27;s music, he got in touch with her and they spent many hours on the phone. They finally met six months after the initial contact and were married on 28 December 1993. Lange is a teetotaler and, as a result, they had non-alcoholic champagne at their wedding. Lange had the song &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; performed as a sign of his dedication to Twain. In August 2001, their son was born.

On 15 May 2008, a spokesman for his employer Mercury Nashville announced that Twain and Lange were separating, after Lange had an affair with Twain&#x27;s then-best friend and secretary Marie-Anne Thiébaud, with whom he reportedly continued the relationship and moved to Switzerland. Lange and Twain divorced in June 2010. On 1 January 2011, Twain married Frédéric Thiébaud, the former husband of Marie-Anne.

In 2011, Lange purchased Coronet Peak Station located on the mountain and ski field of the same name in Queenstown, New Zealand. In 2014, he protected of his land as Queen Elizabeth II National Trust covenant; this is the largest private conservation covenant in New Zealand.

<text>A legal custom is the established pattern of behavior within a particular social setting. A claim can be carried out in defense of &quot;what has always been done and accepted by law&quot;.

Customary law (also, consuetudinary or unofficial law) exists where: 
#a certain legal practice is observed and
#the relevant actors consider it to be an opinion of law or necessity (&quot;opinio juris&quot;).

Most customary laws deal with &quot;standards of the community&quot; that have been long-established in a given locale. However, the term can also apply to areas of international law where certain standards have been nearly universal in their acceptance as correct bases of action – for example, laws against piracy or slavery (see &quot;hostis humani generis&quot;). In many, though not all instances, customary laws will have supportive court rulings and case law that have evolved over time to give additional weight to their rule as law and also to demonstrate the trajectory of evolution (if any) in the judicial interpretation of such law by relevant courts.

==Nature, definition and sources==
A central issue regarding the recognition of custom is determining the appropriate methodology to know what practices and norms actually constitute customary law. It is not immediately clear that classic Western theories of jurisprudence can be reconciled in any useful way with conceptual analyses of customary law, and thus some scholars (like John Comaroff and Simon Roberts) have characterized customary law norms in their own terms. Yet, there clearly remains some disagreement, which is seen in John Hund&#x27;s critique of Comaroff and Roberts&#x27; theory, and preference for the contributions of H. L. A. Hart. Hund argues that Hart&#x27;s &quot; The Concept of Law&quot; solves the conceptual problem with which scholars who have attempted to articulate how customary law principles may be identified, defined, and how they operate in regulating social behavior and resolving disputes.

Customary law is the set of customs, practices and beliefs that are accepted as obligatory rules of conduct by a community.

=== As an indefinite repertoire of norms ===

Comaroff and Roberts&#x27; famous work, &quot;Rules and Processes&quot;, attempted to detail the body of norms that constitute Tswana law in a way that was less legalistic (or rule-oriented) than had Isaac Schapera. They defined &quot;mekgwa le melao ya Setswana&quot; in terms of Casalis and Ellenberger&#x27;s definition: &quot;melao&quot; therefore being rules pronounced by a chief and &quot;mekgwa&quot; as norms that become customary law through traditional usage. Importantly, however, they noted that the Tswana seldom attempt to classify the vast array of existing norms into categories and they thus termed this the &#x27;undifferentiated nature of the normative repertoire&#x27;. Moreover, they observe the co-existence of overtly incompatible norms that may breed conflict, either due to circumstances in a particular situation or inherently due to their incongruous content. This lack of rule classification and failure to eradicate internal inconsistencies between potentially conflicting norms allows for much flexibility in dispute settlement and is also viewed as a &#x27;strategic resource&#x27; for disputants who seek to advance their own success in a case. The latter incongruities (especially inconsistencies of norm content) are typically solved by elevating one of the norms (tacitly) from &#x27;the literal to the symbolic. This allows for the accommodation of both as they now theoretically exist in different realms of reality. This is highly contextual, which further illustrates that norms cannot be viewed in isolation and are open to negotiation. Thus, although there are a small number of so-called non-negotiable norms, the vast majority are viewed and given substance contextually, which is seen as fundamental to the Tswana.

Comaroff and Roberts describe how outcomes of specific cases have the ability to change the normative repertoire, as the repertoire of norms is seen to be both in a state of formation and transformation at all times. These changes are justified on the grounds that they are merely giving recognition to de facto observations of transformation. Furthermore, the legitimacy of a chief is a direct determinant of the legitimacy of his decisions. In the formulation of legislative pronouncements, as opposed to decisions made in dispute resolution, the chief first speaks of the proposed norm with his advisors, then council of headmen, then the public assembly debate the proposed law and may accept or reject it. A chief can proclaim the law even if the public assembly rejects it, but this is not often done; and, if the chief proclaims the legislation against the will of the public assembly, the legislation will become melao, however, it is unlikely that it will be executed because its effectiveness depends on the chief&#x27;s legitimacy and the norm&#x27;s consistency with the practices (and changes in social relations) and will of the people under that chief.

Regarding the invocation of norms in disputes, Comaroff and Roberts used the term, &quot;paradigm of argument&quot;, to refer to the linguistic and conceptual frame used by a disputant, whereby &#x27;a coherent picture of relevant events and actions in terms of one or more implicit or explicit normative referents&#x27; is created. In their explanation, the complainant (who always speaks first) thus establishes a paradigm the defendant can either accept and therefore argue within that specific paradigm or reject and therefore introduce his or her own paradigm (usually, the facts are not contested here). If the defendant means to change the paradigm, they will refer to norms as such, where actually norms are not ordinarily explicitly referenced in Tswana dispute resolution as the audience would typically already know them and just the way one presents one&#x27;s case and constructs the facts will establish one&#x27;s paradigm. The headman or chief adjudicating may also do same: accept the normative basis implied by the parties (or one of them), and thus not refer to norms using explicit language but rather isolate a factual issue in the dispute and then make a decision on it without expressly referring to any norms, or impose a new or different paradigm onto the parties.

=== Law as necessarily rule-governed ===
Hund finds Comaroff and Roberts&#x27; flexibility thesis of a &#x27;repertoire of norms&#x27; from which litigants and adjudicator choose in the process of negotiating solutions between them uncompelling. He is therefore concerned with disproving what he calls &quot;rule scepticism&quot; on their part. He notes that the concept of custom generally denotes convergent behaviour, but not all customs have the force of law. Hund therefore draws from Hart&#x27;s analysis distinguishing social rules, which have internal and external aspects, from habits, which have only external aspects. Internal aspects are the reflective attitude on the part of adherents toward certain behaviours perceived to be obligatory, according to a common standard. External aspects manifest in regular, observable behaviour, but is not obligatory. In Hart&#x27;s analysis, then, social rules amount to custom that has legal force.

Hart identifies three further differences between habits and binding social rules. First, a social rule exists where society frowns on deviation from the habit and attempts to prevent departures by criticising such behaviour. Second, when this criticism is seen socially as a good reason for adhering to the habit, and it is welcomed. And, third, when members of a group behave in a common way not only out of habit or because everyone else is doing it, but because it is seen to be a common standard that should be followed, at least by some members. Hund, however, acknowledges the difficulty of an outsider knowing the dimensions of these criteria that depend on an internal point of view.

For Hund, the first form of rule scepticism concerns the widely held opinion that, because the content of customary law derives from practice, there are actually no objective rules, since it is only behaviour that informs their construction. On this view, it is impossible to distinguish between behaviour that is rule bound and behaviour that is not—i.e., which behaviour is motivated by adherence to law (or at least done in recognition of the law) and is merely a response to other factors. Hund sees this as problematic because it makes quantifying the law almost impossible, since behaviour is obviously inconsistent. Hund argues that this is a misconception based on a failure to acknowledge the importance of the &quot;internal element&quot;. In his view, by using the criteria described above, there is not this problem in deciphering what constitutes &quot;law&quot; in a particular community.

According to Hund, the second form of rule scepticism says that, though a community may have rules, those rules are not arrived at &#x27;deductively&#x27;, i.e. they are not created through legal/moral reasoning only but are instead driven by the personal/political motives of those who create them. The scope for such influence is created by the loose and undefined nature of customary law, which, Hund argues, grants customary-lawmakers (often through traditional &#x27;judicial processes&#x27;) a wide discretion in its application. Yet, Hund contends that the fact that rules might sometimes be arrived at in the more ad hoc way, does not mean that this defines the system. If one requires a perfect system, where laws are created only deductively, then one is left with a system with no rules. For Hund, this cannot be so and an explanation for these kinds of law-making processes is found in Hart&#x27;s conception of &quot;secondary rules&quot; (rules in terms of which the main body of norms are recognised). Hund therefore says that for some cultures, for instance in some sections of Tswana society, the secondary rules have developed only to the point where laws are determined with reference to politics and personal preference. This does not mean that they are not &quot;rules&quot;. Hund argues that if we acknowledge a developmental pattern in societies&#x27; constructions of these secondary rules then we can understand how this society constructs its laws and how it differs from societies that have come to rely on an objective, stand-alone body of rules.

==Codification==

The modern codification of civil law developed from the tradition of medieval custumals, collections of local customary law that developed in a specific manorial or borough jurisdiction, and which were slowly pieced together mainly from case law and later written down by local jurists. Custumals acquired the force of law when they became the undisputed rule by which certain rights, entitlements, and obligations were regulated between members of a community. Some examples include Bracton&#x27;s for England, the for the city of Paris, the for northern Germany, and the many of Spain.

==International law==
In international law, &quot;customary law&quot; refers to the &quot;Law of Nations&quot; or the legal norms that have developed through the customary exchanges between states over time, whether based on diplomacy or aggression. Essentially, legal obligations are believed to arise between states to carry out their affairs consistently with past accepted conduct. These customs can also change based on the acceptance or rejection by states of particular acts. Some principles of customary law have achieved the force of peremptory norms, which cannot be violated or altered except by a norm of comparable strength. These norms are said to gain their strength from universal acceptance, such as the prohibitions against genocide and slavery. Customary international law can be distinguished from treaty law, which consists of explicit agreements between nations to assume obligations. However, many treaties are attempts to codify pre-existing customary law.

==Within contemporary legal systems==

Customary law is a recognized source of law within jurisdictions of the civil law tradition, where it may be subordinate to both statutes and regulations. In addressing custom as a source of law within the civil law tradition, John Henry Merryman notes that, though the attention it is given in scholarly works is great, its importance is &quot;slight and decreasing&quot;. On the other hand, in many countries around the world, one or more types of customary law continue to exist side by side with official law, a condition referred to as legal pluralism (see also List of national legal systems).

In the canon law of the Catholic Church, custom is a source of law. Canonical jurisprudence, however, differs from civil law jurisprudence in requiring the express or implied consent of the legislator for a custom to obtain the force of law.

In the English common law, &quot;long usage&quot; must be established.

It is a broad principle of property law that, if something has gone on for a long time without objection, whether it be using a right of way or occupying land to which one has no title, the law will eventually recognise the fact and give the person doing it the legal right to continue.

It is known in case law as &quot;customary rights&quot;. Something which has been practised since time immemorial by reference to a particular locality may acquire the legal status of a custom, which is a form of local law. The legal criteria defining a custom are precise. The most common claim in recent times, is for customary rights to moor a vessel.

The mooring must have been in continuous use for &quot;time immemorial&quot; which is defined by legal precedent as 12 years (or 20 years for Crown land) for the same purpose by people using them for that purpose. To give two examples: a custom of mooring which might have been established in past times for over two hundred years by the fishing fleet of local inhabitants of a coastal community will not simply transfer so as to benefit present day recreational boat owners who may hail from much further afield. Whereas a group of houseboats on a mooring that has been in continuous use for the last 25 years with a mixture of owner occupiers and rented houseboats, may clearly continue to be used by houseboats, where the owners live in the same town or city. Both the purpose of the moorings and the class of persons benefited by the custom must have been clear and consistent.

In Canada, customary aboriginal law has a constitutional foundation and for this reason has increasing influence.

In the Scandinavian countries customary law continues to exist and has great influence.

Customary law is also used in some developing countries, usually used alongside common or civil law. For example, in Ethiopia, despite the adoption of legal codes based on civil law in the 1950s according to Dolores Donovan and Getachew Assefa there are more than 60 systems of customary law currently in force, &quot;some of them operating quite independently of the formal state legal system&quot;. They offer two reasons for the relative autonomy of these customary law systems: one is that the Ethiopian government lacks sufficient resources to enforce its legal system to every corner of Ethiopia; the other is that the Ethiopian government has made a commitment to preserve these customary systems within its boundaries.

In 1995, President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akaev announced a decree to revitalize the &quot;aqsaqal&quot; courts of village elders. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law. The &quot;aqsaqal&quot; courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 &quot;aqsaqal&quot; courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of Bishkek. Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity. In a 2005 speech, he connected the courts back to the country&#x27;s nomadic past and extolled how the courts expressed the Kyrgyz ability of self-governance. Similar &quot;aqsaqal&quot; courts exist, with varying levels of legal formality, in other countries of Central Asia.

The Somali people in the Horn of Africa follow a customary law system referred to as &quot;xeer&quot;. It survives to a significant degree everywhere in Somalia and in the Somali communities in the Ogaden. Economist Peter Leeson attributes the increase in economic activity since the fall of the Siad Barre administration to the security in life, liberty and property provided by Xeer in large parts of Somalia. The Dutch attorney Michael van Notten also draws upon his experience as a legal expert in his comprehensive study on Xeer, &quot;The Law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic Development in the Horn of Africa&quot; (2005).

In India many customs are accepted by law. For example, Hindu marriage ceremonies are recognized by the Hindu Marriage Act.

In Indonesia, customary adat laws of the country&#x27;s various indigenous ethnicities are recognized, and customary dispute resolution is recognized in Papua. Indonesian adat law are mainly divided into 19 circles, namely Aceh, Gayo, Alas, and Batak, Minangkabau, South Sumatra, the Malay regions, Bangka and Belitung, Kalimantan, Minahasa, Gorontalo, Toraja, South Sulawesi, Ternate, the Molluccas, Papua, Timor, Bali and Lombok, Central and East Java including the island of Madura, Sunda, and the Javanese monarchies, including the Yogyakarta Sultanate, Surakarta Sunanate, and the Pakualaman and Mangkunegaran princely states.

In the Philippines, the Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Rights Act of 1997 recognizes customary laws of indigenous peoples within their domain.

==Custom in torts==
Custom is used in tort law to help determine negligence. Following or disregarding a custom is not determinative of negligence, but instead is an indication of possible best practices or alternatives to a particular action.

<text>Jeremy Michael Boorda (November 26, 1939 – May 16, 1996) was a United States Navy admiral who served as the 25th Chief of Naval Operations. Boorda is notable as the first person to have risen from the enlisted ranks to become Chief of Naval Operations, the highest-ranking billet in the United States Navy.

Boorda died by suicide by shooting himself in the chest after leaving suicide notes reported to contain expressions of concern that he had tarnished the reputation of the Navy, following a media investigation into the legitimacy of his having worn on his uniform two service medals with bronze &quot;V&quot; devices, which indicate the awards were for acts of valor. The &quot;V&quot; devices are by regulation only to be awarded to personnel who performed an act of valor in actual combat, and Boorda had not served in combat. Boorda had removed the two medal devices on his uniform almost a year before he died and was generally perceived as having made a good-faith error in believing he was authorized to wear the devices.

==Early life==
Boorda was born in South Bend, Indiana, to Jewish parents, Gertrude (Frank) Wallis and Herman Boorda. His family moved to Momence, Illinois, where his father had a dress shop. His grandparents had immigrated from Ukraine.

When he was 19, Boorda married Bettie Mae Moran. Their first son David was born with severe disabilities. They had two more sons, Edward and Robert, and a daughter named Anna. Boorda and his wife raised their children as Protestants.

==Career==
Boorda dropped out of high school to enlist in the United States Navy in 1956 at the age of 17; it provided a structure he at first disliked but came to appreciate. He finished high school while in the Navy and attained the rate of Personnelman First Class. While an enlisted man. Boorda served a variety of commands, primarily in aviation. His last two enlisted assignments were in Attack Squadron 144 and Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 11.

Boorda was selected for potential commissioning under the Integration Program in 1962, by which enlisted sailors were admitted to the Navy&#x27;s Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. Boorda was commissioned as an ensign upon graduating in August 1962. He first served aboard as combat information center officer at the rank of lieutenant junior grade. In 1964, he attended the Naval Destroyer School in Newport.

In October 1964, Boorda was assigned as weapons officer aboard the destroyer . The destroyer deployed to Vietnam in March 1965 and participated in combat missions and operations off the coast of Vietnam until it departed for San Diego on August 11. On August 15, Boorda was recommended for the Navy Commendation Medal by his commanding officer on &quot;John R. Craig&quot;. On August 28, the Commander in Chief, U.S Pacific Fleet, approved a lesser award, the Secretary of the Navy Commendation for Achievement (redesignated the Navy Achievement Medal in July 1967). The citation read: &quot;for meritorious service while serving as Weapons Officer in USS JOHN R. CRAIG (DD 885) while operating in combat missions supporting the Republic of Vietnam from 10 April to 10 August 1965&quot;.

After the destroyer arrived in San Diego in September, Boorda served as commander of . His first shore tour was as a weapons instructor at Naval Destroyer School in Newport. In December 1971, after attending the U.S. Naval War College and also earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Rhode Island, Boorda assumed duties as Executive Officer, , a guided missile destroyer. In October 1972, the Seventh Fleet, including Boorda&#x27;s ship departed for Vietnam; his second tour began in November 1972 and ended on February 19, 1973. On April 8, the commanding officer of &quot;Brooke&quot; recommended Boorda for the Navy Commendation Medal (without the Combat &quot;V&quot;). The medal was approved by the Commander, Seventh Fleet, and the citation read: &quot;for meritorious achievement as Executive Officer while attached to and serving in USS BROOKE (DEG 1) from 15 December 1971 to 20 February 1973 including combat operations&quot;.

That tour was followed by a short period at the University of Oklahoma as an NROTC special instructor and an assignment from June 1973 to May 1975 as head, surface lieutenant commander assignments/assistant for captain detailing in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, Washington, D.C. From 1975 to 1977, Boorda commanded . He was next assigned as executive assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), Washington, DC. He relieved the civilian presidential appointee in that position, remaining until 1981, when he took command of Destroyer Squadron 22. After this, Boorda spent an additional period studying at the Naval War College from September to October 1983. In 1983–84, he served as executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Personnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel and Training. In December 1984, he assumed his first flag officer assignment as executive assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, remaining until July 1986. His next assignment was commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight in Norfolk, Virginia; he served as a carrier battle group commander embarked in , and also as commander, Battle Force Sixth Fleet in 1987.

In August 1988, Boorda became Chief of Naval Personnel/Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel and Training. In November 1991, he received his fourth star and in December 1991, became Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH – Naples, Italy) and Commander in Chief, United States Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR – London). As CINCSOUTH, Boorda was in command of all NATO forces engaged in operations enforcing United Nations sanctions during the Yugoslav wars.

On February 1, 1993, while serving as Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe, Boorda assumed the additional duty as Commander, Joint Task Force Provide Promise, responsible for the supply of humanitarian relief to Bosnia-Herzegovina via air-land and air-drop missions, and for troops contributing to the UN mission throughout the Balkans. On April 23, 1994, Boorda became the 25th Chief of Naval Operations, the first who was not a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and the first of Jewish descent.

On February 24, 1996, he attended the christening and launching of at the Avondale Shipyard located on the west bank of the Mississippi River near New Orleans, Louisiana. Boorda personally greeted 73 members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, and over 600 other military and civilian honorees who also were invited.

===Seaman to Admiral===
Boorda was a product of an enlisted-to-officer commissioning program in the early 1960s. Known as the Integration Program, this was designed to provide an opportunity for enlisted personnel who possessed outstanding qualifications and motivation for a naval career to obtain a commission. Boorda was the first Chief of Naval Operations to have risen from the enlisted rates, one of only four such modern service chiefs (the others being Air Force General Larry D. Welch, USMC General Alfred Gray, and Army General John Shalikashvili). Upon assuming this position, Boorda immediately re-established the historic program, naming it &quot;Seaman to Admiral&quot;, as part of a STA-21 initiative for young sailors to earn their commission and become naval officers. Boorda believed &quot;people should have the opportunity to excel, and be all they can be, even if they don&#x27;t get a perfect or traditional start.&quot;

===C4I===
Boorda was particularly interested in C4I initiatives to place command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence assets on naval ships. Essentially this manifested itself as more robust combat information systems, with improved satellite and communication links, as well as placing more defensive assets on traditionally non-combatant ships such as support vessels. Boorda initiated efforts during the proposal phase for the future LPD-17 amphibious class to be fitted with first-class C4I suites, radars, communications, and defense systems-anti-torpedo, anti-missile, and anti-NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical), along with blast-hardened bulkheads that will absorb and dissipate much more punishment than is possible with present designs. This effort was a departure from past efforts, which relied on simply assigning a destroyer or cruiser to provide these functions for amphibious forces. The ship was commissioned January 14, 2006, nine years after Boorda&#x27;s death.

===Enlisted advancement system===
Boorda also spearheaded efforts to change the U.S. Navy&#x27;s officer fitness report, enlisted evaluation, and enlisted advancement systems. The new systems were more systematic and consistent. The systems also allowed a more concise rating of an officer&#x27;s or sailor&#x27;s advancement potential. This rating allowed a command to mark only 20% of officers or sailors as &quot;early promotes&quot;, and set strict grading criteria for each evaluation mark. The new system linked each promotion marking to the advancement system.

===Littoral oceanography===
Boorda signed a policy for naval oceanography (the first such revision in 10 years), which emphasized, among other things, that, in addition to deep-water missions, naval oceanographers must master the complicated tangle of the oceanographic/geographic subject areas that make up the science of the littorals, or near-shore areas, as well as the complex weather patterns characteristic of any coastal area.

Boorda&#x27;s vision brought the navy&#x27;s new focus on littoral operations into alignment with naval projection policies. But this new program also created a large backlog of high priority oceanographic, hydrographic, and geophysical survey requirements. To meet those requirements, the navy expanded its oceanographic efforts from traditional platforms (ships, boats, planes) to new technologies (satellites, remote sensors, etc.), and efforts to work with other national and international agencies.

===Stan Arthur incident===
In the wake of the Tailhook scandal, Boorda faced hostility from a majority of naval flag officers who reportedly believed he had betrayed the Navy by allying himself with Clinton administration demands for reform of the Navy&#x27;s officer corps. Naval aviators, in particular, were incensed by the treatment of Stan Arthur (Vice Chief of Naval Operations and senior Naval aviator), whose nomination for the post of commander, United States Pacific Command, was withdrawn by President Clinton at the behest of U.S. Senator David Durenberger.

Durenberger raised questions over Arthur&#x27;s possible mishandling of sexual harassment allegations brought by one of the Senator&#x27;s constituents, Rebecca Hansen, a female student naval aviator who had not successfully completed flight training.

The administration expected protracted hearings to ensue over Arthur&#x27;s nomination, and the Pacific Command position to remain unfilled during this period. Arthur decided to retire on February 1, 1995. Boorda issued an unusual public defense of Arthur and his decision not to fight for the nomination, saying that &quot;Stan Arthur is an officer of integrity ... who chose to take this selfless action ... in the interests of more rapidly filling a critical leadership position. Those who postulate other reasons for the withdrawal are simply wrong.&quot;

===Death===
Boorda died on May 16, 1996, in the garden outside his home at the Washington Navy Yard. Boorda reportedly left two typed and unsigned suicide notes in his home, neither of which was released publicly, but were said to have been addressed to his wife and to his public information officer.

Boorda was reported to have been distraught over a media investigation led by decorated U.S. Army Vietnam War veteran David Hackworth of &quot;Newsweek&quot; into two miniature bronze letter &quot;V&quot;s that Boorda had worn for years on two of his uniform&#x27;s service ribbons. In the Navy, the Combat Distinguishing Device, or &quot;V&quot; device, is worn on a ribbon to denote a specific decoration was awarded for valor in or direct exposure to combat. Photographs of Boorda in uniform showed him wearing the &quot;V&quot; devices on his Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal ribbons in the 1980s. However, Boorda stopped wearing the &quot;V&quot; devices on these service ribbons about a year before the Hackworth investigation, after being informed by the Navy that he was not authorized to wear them.

Reports at the time of Boorda&#x27;s suicide indicated that his wearing of the two &quot;V&quot; devices on the two service ribbons had not been an intentional deception on his part, but had been an unintentional mistake that resulted from his following verbal instructions delivered to commanders during the Vietnam War by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt when he was Chief of Naval Operations, as well as conflicting interpretations and updating of Navy award regulations. &quot;Newsweek&quot; later reported that &quot;Hackworth believed that wearing an undeserved combat pin for valor was a grave matter of honor in the military, &#x27;the worst thing you can do. Boorda&#x27;s suicide took place shortly before he was to have met with two &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporters that day regarding his wearing of the &quot;V&quot; devices. Boorda was said to have been worried that the issue would cause more trouble for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s reputation.

Former Chief of Naval Operations Zumwalt, who was Boorda&#x27;s commander during the Vietnam War and who verbally authorized &quot;V&quot; devices for Boorda and many other sailors, wrote a letter to the effect that Boorda&#x27;s wearing of the devices was &quot;appropriate, justified and proper.&quot; However, wearing the Navy&#x27;s Combat Distinguishing Device on a specific decoration that may authorize the device requires written authorization for the device on a printed award citation.

Boorda was survived by his wife, Bettie Moran Boorda, four children and eleven grandchildren. Boorda was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on May 19, 1996, with a tombstone marked with the Star of David. On May 21, a public memorial service was held at the Washington National Cathedral that was broadcast nationally by CNN with tape delay broadcast on the C-SPAN network.

In June 1998, then Navy Secretary John Dalton put into Boorda&#x27;s file a letter from Admiral Zumwalt stating it was &quot;&#x27;appropriate, justified and proper&#x27; for Boorda to attach the &quot;V&quot; devices to the ribbons on his uniform.&quot; According to the Associated Press, &quot;the Navy also modified Boorda&#x27;s record to list the V&#x27;s among his other decorations... recognition that they were earned.&quot; However, later that year, one of Boorda&#x27;s sons requested a formal review of his father&#x27;s service record. In a decision dated June 24, 1999, the Department of the Navy Board for Correction of Naval Records, the ultimate arbiter of whether or not Boorda was entitled to wear the &quot;V&quot; devices, determined that despite the additions to Boorda&#x27;s personnel file, he was not.

==Awards and decorations==
Boorda&#x27;s military decorations and awards include:


==Legacy==
Boorda has two sons and one daughter-in-law who are naval officers. He has four grandsons who served in the U.S. military: Peter Boorda was a petty officer in the United States Coast Guard, Andrew Boorda is an armor officer in the U.S. Army, Phillip Boorda is an amphibious assault vehicle officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, and Robert Dowling is an intelligence officer in the U.S. Army. Andrew and Phillip are twins, and like their grandfather, both graduated from the University of Rhode Island. In addition, Boorda has a step-grandson who also graduated from the University of Rhode Island and is a field artillery officer in the U.S. Army.

In Joe Biden&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Promises to Keep,&quot; Biden recounts his experience of interacting with Admiral Boorda. Boorda met with Joe Biden in 1993, while serving as commander-in-chief of Allied Forces Southern Command, to advise the then-Senator on the military situation in the Balkans. Biden had been attempting to persuade the Clinton administration to intervene militarily to stop the genocide in Bosnia, but had been met with resistance, due to the widespread perception in Washington that any U.S. military intervention in the Balkans would have to involve significant numbers of ground troops. Boorda, however, argued that U.S. air power &#x27;could shut down the Serb aggression and could end the sieges in Sarajevo and Srebrenica&#x27; without the need for a costly and unpopular commitment of ground forces. Biden credits this conversation with Boorda as being &#x27;the last piece of the puzzle&#x27;, enabling him to successfully make the case for intervention in Bosnia to Clinton. In his book, Biden is effusive in his praise of Boorda, calling him &#x27;truly heroic&#x27;, including him in a partial list of &#x27;the twenty brightest, most informed individuals I&#x27;ve worked with in government&#x27;, and referring to his suicide as &#x27;a blow to the country&#x27;.

===Admiral Jeremy M. Boorda Award===
The Navy&#x27;s annual Admiral Boorda award was established and first awarded in 2003. The award recognizes a Navy military and civilian individual. The call for nominations for the 2015 award indicated that the award was intended for those who have made significant contributions towards Navy personnel readiness either through research or analysis or the direct application of analytical results to policies and laws.

<doc id="218802" wikidata="Q2638956" url="?curid=218802" title="Ubykh phonology">
<text>Ubykh, an extinct Northwest Caucasian language, has the largest consonant inventory of all documented languages that do not use clicks, and also has the most disproportional ratio of phonemic consonants to vowels. It has consonants in at least eight, perhaps nine, basic places of articulation and 29 distinct fricatives, 27 sibilants, and 20 uvulars, more than any other documented language. Some Khoisan languages, such as Taa (or !Xóõ), may have larger consonant inventories due to their extensive use of click consonants, although some analyses view a large proportion of the clicks in these languages as clusters, which would bring them closer into line with the Caucasian languages.

== Consonants ==
=== Standard Ubykh Phonology ===
Below is an International Phonetic Alphabet representation of the Standard Ubykh consonant inventory.

# Note the large number of basic series; Ubykh has basic consonants at nine places of articulation.
# The glottal stop is also noted, but only as an allophone of .
# The three postalveolar series have traditionally been called &quot;postalveolar&quot;, &quot;alveolo-palatal&quot;, and &quot;retroflex&quot;, respectively, and have been transcribed with their associated symbols.
# The laminal and apical postalveolar series are more accurately transcribed as and , respectively.
# There is no standard IPA notation for the laminal-closed postalveolar series. They are transcribed , , , etc. by Catford, or sometimes as , , , etc.
# The velar stops and the labiodental fricative are only found in Turkish and Circassian loanwords.
# Out of the labials, the fricatives are labiodental, the others bilabial.
# /tʷ, dʷ, tʷʼ/ are in free variation with [t͡p, d͡b, t͡pʼ].

All but four of the 84 consonants are found in native vocabulary. The plain velars and the voiced labiodental fricative are found mainly in loans and onomatopoeia: (&#x27;crow&#x27;) from Turkish &quot;karga&quot;), (&#x27;slat, batten&#x27;) from Laz &quot;k&#x27;avari&quot; &#x27;roofing shingle&#x27;), (&#x27;estate, legacy&#x27;) from Turkish &quot;vakıf&quot;), (&#x27;the sound of glass breaking&#x27;). As well, the pharyngealised labial consonants are almost exclusively noted in words where they are associated with another pharyngealised consonant (for instance, &#x27;handful&#x27;), but are occasionally found outside this context (for example, the verb root &#x27;to explode, to burst&#x27;). Finally, is mainly found in interjections and loans, with (&#x27;now&#x27;) the only real native word to contain the phoneme. The frequency of consonants in Ubykh is quite variable; the phoneme alone accounts for over 12% of all consonants encountered in connected text, due to the presence of the phoneme in the ergative and oblique singular and plural case suffixes, the third person singular and plural ergative verbal agreement prefix, the adverbial derivative suffix, the present and imperfect tense suffixes, and in suffixes denoting several non-finite verb forms.

Very few allophones of consonants are noted, mainly because a small acoustic difference can be phonemic when so many consonants are involved. However, the alveolopalatal labialised fricatives were sometimes realised as alveolar labialised fricatives , and the uvular ejective stop was often pronounced as a glottal stop in the past tense suffix -, due to the influence of the Kabardian and Adyghe languages.

The consonant has not been attested word-initially, and is found initially only in the personal name , but every other consonant can begin a word. Restrictions on word-final consonants have not yet been investigated; however, Ubykh has a slight preference for open syllables (CV) over closed ones (VC or CVC). The pharyngealised consonants and have not been noted word-finally, but this is probably a statistical anomaly due to the rarity of these consonants, each being attested only in a handful of words.

The alveolar trill is not common in native Ubykh vocabulary, appearing mostly in loan words. However, the phoneme carries a phonaesthetic concept of rolling or a repeated action in a few verbs, notably ~ (&#x27;to roll around&#x27;) and ~ (&#x27;to slither&#x27;).

=== Karacalar Ubykh Phonology ===
A divergent dialect of Ubykh spoken by Osman Güngör, an inhabitant of Karacalar in Balıkesir province was investigated by Georges Dumézil in the 1960s. Below is an International Phonetic Alphabet representation of the Karacalar Ubykh consonant inventory.

Güngör&#x27;s speech differed phonologically from Standard Ubykh in a number of ways:

* the labialised alveolar stops have merged into the corresponding bilabial stops .
* The labialised alveolopalatal fricatives have merged with their postalveolar counterparts .
* seems to have disappeared.
* Pharyngealisation is no longer distinctive, surviving only on the lexemes (&#x27;to be ill&#x27;) and (&#x27;to bark&#x27;), and being replaced in many instances by gemination (standard (&#x27;dog&#x27;) → Karacalar ), and in at least one instance by ejectivisation (standard (&#x27;roasted maize&#x27;) → Karacalar ).
* Palatalisation of the uvular consonants is no longer phonemic, also being replaced in many instances by gemination (standard (&#x27;to cough&#x27;) → Karacalar ).
* The voiced retroflex affricate has, at least in some cases, merged with .

== Vowels ==
Ubykh has very few basic phonemic vowels. The analysis in retains as a separate vowel, but most other linguists do not accept this analysis, preferring one with simpler vertical distinction: and . Other vowels, notably , appear in some loanwords. The question of whether an additional vowel should be retained is of some debate, since it differs from not in length but in quality. However, phonologically and diachronically, it is often derived from two instances of .

Even with so few vowels, there are many vowel allophones, affected by the secondary articulation of the consonants that surround them. Eleven basic phonetic vowels appear, mostly derived from the two phonemic vowels adjacent to labialised or palatalised consonants. The phonetic vowels are and . In general, the following rules apply:

: and 
: and 
: and 
: and 

Other, more complex vowels have been noted as allophones: (&#x27;you did it&#x27;) can become , for instance. On occasion, nasal sonorants (particularly ) may even decay into vowel nasality. For instance, (&#x27;young man&#x27;) has been noted as as well as .

The vowel appears initially very frequently, particularly in the function of the definite article. is extremely restricted initially, appearing only in ditransitive verb forms where all three arguments are third person, e.g. (&#x27;he gave it to him&#x27;) (normally ). Even then, itself may be dropped to provide an even shorter form .

Both vowels appear without restriction finally, although when is unstressed finally, it tends to be dropped: (&#x27;father&#x27;) becomes the definite form (&#x27;the father&#x27;). In fact, the alternation between and zero is often not phonemic, and may be dropped root-internally as well: ~ (&#x27;hoe&#x27;). This kind of allomorphy is called a zero allomorph.

 argues that there are three vowels which correspond to Dumézil&#x27;s respectively and this is evident in the minimal triplet of (&#x27;I milk X&#x27;), (&#x27;I reap X&#x27;), and (&#x27;I milk them; I reap them&#x27;).

<text>Andrew Bradford (1686 – November 24, 1742) was an early American printer in colonial Philadelphia. He published the first newspaper in Philadelphia, &quot;The American Weekly Mercury&quot;, beginning in 1719, as well as the first magazine in America in 1741.

==Life and career==
He was the son of a printer, and grandson of two others. He was born to William and Elizabeth Sowle Bradford in Philadelphia. In 1692, the family moved to New York, and there he learned the printing trade from his father. In 1709, Andrew Bradford was listed as a printer in New York; that year, he declined an offer from Rhode Island to become that colony&#x27;s printer.

He returned to Philadelphia in 1712 and opened his own print shop. On December 22, 1719, he began publication of &quot;The American Weekly Mercury&quot;. This was the first newspaper in Philadelphia and enjoyed a wide circulation. He also taught the print business to his nephew William Bradford and for a time employed Benjamin Franklin when Franklin first came to Philadelphia, introduced by Bradford&#x27;s father William. Franklin would go on to establish a rival printing press and newspaper, the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, in Philadelphia. On February 13, 1741, Bradford published the first issue of the &quot;American Magazine&quot;, the first magazine to be published in America — beating out Franklin for the honor by three days.

Throughout the 1720s, Bradford published political pamphlets critical of the local government, denouncing its &quot;sinking credit&quot; and supporting freedom of the press. He also published &quot;Busy-Body&quot; essays, criticisms of the colonial government penned by Franklin and Joseph Breintnall, in the &quot;Mercury&quot;. For these political actions, Bradford was brought before a council, censured several times, and jailed once. 

Bradford&#x27;s first wife was Dorcas Boels, who died in 1739. Bradford then married Cornelia Smith, who took over his print shop and newspaper upon his death in 1742.

<doc id="218818" wikidata="Q556941" url="?curid=218818" title="Mike McCartney">
<text>Peter Michael McCartney (born 7 January 1944), known professionally as Mike McGear, is an English performing artist and photographer who was a member of the groups the Scaffold and Grimms. He is the younger brother of former Beatle Paul McCartney.

==Early years==
Michael and his brother Paul were both born in the Walton Centre in Walton, Liverpool, England, where their mother, Mary McCartney, had previously worked as a nursing sister in charge of the maternity ward. Michael was not enrolled in a Catholic school because his father, Jim McCartney, believed that they leaned too much towards religion instead of education. At age 17, McCartney started his first job at Jackson&#x27;s the Tailors in Ranelagh Street, Liverpool. The year after, he took an apprenticeship at Andre Bernard, a ladies&#x27; hairdresser in the same street.

==Musical career==
At the time the Beatles became successful, Mike McCartney was working as an apprentice at a ladies’ hairdresser, where the staff included future actor Lewis Collins and budding comedian Jimmy Tarbuck. Simultaneously, he was a member of the Liverpool comedy-poetry-music group The Scaffold (along with Roger McGough and John Gorman). The group formed in 1962 (the year of the Beatles&#x27; first hit). Mike decided to use a stage name, so as not to appear to be riding his brother&#x27;s coattails. After first dubbing himself &quot;Mike Blank&quot;, he settled on &quot;Mike McGear&quot;, &quot;gear&quot; being the Liverpudlian equivalent of &quot;&quot;. The band was subsequently signed to Parlophone.

The Scaffold recorded a number of UK hit singles between 1966 and 1974, the most successful being the 1968 Christmas number one single, &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;. McGear composed the band&#x27;s next biggest hit, 1967&#x27;s &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot;. In 1968, he and McGough released a &quot;duo&quot; album (&quot;McGough &amp; McGear&quot;) that included the usual Scaffold mix of lyrics, poems, and comedy. The Scaffold ended up hosting a TV programme, &quot;Score with the Scaffold&quot;, which limited the musical portion of their career, and they were dropped by Parlophone. McGear then signed to Island Records and released a solo musical album entitled &quot;Woman&quot; in 1972, which again included many tracks co-written with McGough, and The Scaffold subsequently released their own album on the label, &quot;Fresh Liver&quot;.

The Scaffold then added several other members and released two albums on Island in 1973 as GRIMMS (an acronym for Gorman-Roberts-Innes-McGear-McGough-Stanshall). However, McGear quit GRIMMS after the second album out of tension between himself and one of the poets added to the group.

McGear then signed to Warner Bros. Records and in 1974 released his second non-comedy musical album, &quot;McGear&quot;, in which he collaborated with his brother Paul and his band Wings. Although four singles were released from these sessions, only &quot;Leave It&quot; enjoyed any moderate chart success (No. 36 UK). However, also recorded during McCartney&#x27;s sessions with Wings was a Scaffold &quot;reunion&quot; song, &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot;, which became The Scaffold&#x27;s last top-ten hit. This led to the group&#x27;s re-formation in 1974, and they recorded and performed together through to 1977.

Individually, McGear released a few more singles. His final release, while still using the name Mike McGear, was the 1981 release &quot;No Lar Di Dar (Is Lady Di)&quot;. This was a satirical tribute to Lady Diana Spencer, released at the time of her wedding to Prince Charles.

In the 1980s, after retiring from music, Mike McCartney decided to end his use of the &quot;McGear&quot; pseudonym and revert to using his family name.

==Photography career==
McCartney was a photographer during his entire musical career, and has continued with photography since then. Beatles&#x27; manager Brian Epstein nicknamed him &quot;Flash Harry&quot; in the early 1960s because he was always taking pictures with a flash gun. He has published books of pictures that he took of the Beatles backstage and on tour and, in 2008, brought out a limited edition book of photos that he had taken spontaneously backstage at Live8. In 2005, McCartney premiered and exhibited a collection of photographs that he had taken in the 1960s, called &quot;Mike McCartney&#x27;s Liverpool Life&quot;, both in Liverpool and other venues, such as the Provincial Museum of Alberta. In addition, an exhibition book of the collection was published. He also took the cover photograph for Paul McCartney&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&quot;. &quot;Mike McCartney&#x27;s North Highlands&quot;, a collection of his photographs taken in the Scottish Highlands, was published in 2009, with a foreword by Charles, Prince of Wales.

==Personal life==
The McCartney brothers also have a sister named Ruth whom their father Jim adopted in 1964 when he married her mother, Angela Williams. Mike McCartney married Angela Fishwick on 7 June 1968 and they had three daughters: Benna, Theran, and Abigail Faith; they later divorced. He married Rowena Horne on 29 May 1982 and they have three sons: Joshua, Max, and Sonny.

In 2019, McCartney was awarded the British Empire Medal in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;services to the community in Merseyside&quot;.

<text>The PDP-6, short for Programmed Data Processor model 6, is a computer developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) during 1963 and first delivered in the summer of 1964. It was an expansion of DEC&#x27;s existing 18-bit systems to use a 36-bit data word, which was at that time a common word size for large machines like IBM mainframes. The system was constructed using the same germanium individual transistor-based System Module layout as DEC&#x27;s earlier machines, like the PDP-1 and PDP-4.

The system was designed with real-time computing use in mind, not just batch processing as was typical for most mainframes. Using a 36-bit word with 18-bit addresses allowed it to efficiently store the cons structure found in the Lisp language, which made it particularly useful in artificial intelligence labs like Project MAC at MIT. It was also complex, expensive, and unreliable as a result of its use of so many early-model transistors. Only 23 were sold, at prices ranging from $120,000 to $300,000.

The lasting influence of the PDP-6 was its re-implementation using modern silicon transistors and the newer Flip-Chip module packaging to produce the PDP-10. The instruction sets of the two machines are almost identical. The PDP-10 was less expensive and more reliable, and about 1500 were sold during its lifetime.

==History==
DEC&#x27;s first products were not computers but a series of plug-in circuits known as Digital Laboratory Modules that performed digital logic. Users could wire the modules together to perform specific tasks. DEC soon introduced the PDP-1 which was built out of large numbers of these modules, now known as System Building Blocks or System Modules.

The PDP-1 used an 18-bit word. Word lengths in the early 1960s were generally some multiple of six bits, as the character codes of the era were 6 bits long and it was also a useful size for storing binary-coded decimal digits with an optional sign, as commonly used on IBM machines of the era. Large machines generally used a 36-bit word length, but there were many variations. The PDP-1&#x27;s 18-bit length allowed the machine to be simpler and less expensive than these, at . Proposals for a PDP-2 and PDP-3 were turned down, and DEC&#x27;s next machine, the PDP-4, was essentially a smaller and less-expensive PDP-1 that sold for roughly half the cost. The PDP-5 was built from the same components, but used a 12-bit word for even greater savings and sold for about .

The PDP-6 was DEC&#x27;s first &quot;big&quot; machine. It used 36-bit words, in common with other large computers at the time from companies like IBM, Honeywell and General Electric. Unlike those machines, the PDP-6 was supplied with a timesharing system &quot;out of the box&quot;. Timesharing had been available for other machines, most famously the PDP-1 at Project MAC, but the PDP-6 was the first such system to be supported by the manufacturer.

Worldwide, only 23 PDP-6&#x27;s were sold, the smallest number of any DEC machine. It was complex and expensive to build, as well as difficult to install and get operational at the customer&#x27;s site. Additionally, the sales force found the PDP-6 to be a &quot;hard sell&quot;. Nevertheless, the company later considered the PDP-6 to be a success:

The sales were so slow that DEC eventually decided to abandon the system and announced that they would not build any more 36-bit machines. Fortunately, this decision was reversed and a new 36-bit system was designed using the new Flip-Chip modules and much smaller system boards to improve density and reliability. The resulting design was released in 1966 as the PDP-10. DEC describes this machine as the successor to the PDP-6. Although it was program-compatible with the PDP-6, it ran roughly twice as fast, had both timesharing and batch processing features, and offered a wide variety of expansions and input/output options. It was far more successful and eventually sold about 1,500 machines.

==Description==
===Architecture===
Addressing remained 18-bit, as in earlier DEC machines, allowing for a 256 kword main memory, about 1 MB in modern terms. Memory was implemented using magnetic cores; a typical system included 32,768 words (equivalent to 144 kB on modern machines). The use of a 36-bit word allowed two 18-bit addresses to be stored in a single memory location; this made it suited to the storage of a cons, a widely used structure in the Lisp language, meaning the PDP-6 could store a cons in a single word and read and write one in a single operation.

The instruction set architecture could be categorized as &quot;one-and-a-half address&quot;. The opcode was stored in the most significant bits of the 36-bit word, using 9 bits. The next four bits indicate which of sixteen registers to apply the instruction to. The last 18 bits indicated an address. Thus, a typical instruction might be &quot;add the value in memory location 1234 to the value in register 4&quot;. Thus the format contains one-and-a-half addresses, the half being the register.

This left another five bits in the instruction word, bits 13 through 17. Bit 13 indicated the address was indirect; instead of the value stored in address 1234 being added to the selected register, the value in 1234 was interpreted as another address, the value in that location used. For instance, if the value in 1234 is 2345, the resulting instruction would add the value in 2345 to register 4. This sort of access pattern was common as it allowed tables to be scanned over using a single instruction and then changing the value in memory to point to another location. The remaining four bits offered a similar functionality by selecting a second register as an index register, allowing memory to be stepped through by changing the value in the register rather than in main memory, which is generally faster.

The registers in the PDP-6 were simply the first 16 memory locations of main memory. Most, if not all, PDP-6 systems were equipped with the optional Type 162 &quot;Fast Memory&quot;, which constructed these 16 memory locations from discrete-transistor flip-flops. These operated four times as fast as the core memory.

===Hardware===
The PDP-6 weighed about , with &quot;Fast Memory&quot;.

The PDP-6 was infamous because of the 6205 board, a large (11 × 9 inches) board which contained 1 bit of arithmetic register (AR), memory buffer (MB), and multiplier-quotient register (MQ). The CPU was built from 36 such cards. It had 88 transistors, a two-sided PC etch, two 18-pin and two 22-pin connectors (two on each side of the module). Because of all these connectors, swapping this module was a major undertaking, and the mechanical coupling made it highly likely that fixing one fault would cause another. There was also a great fear of powering off a PDP-6, since it would generally result in at least one 6205 board failing.

The experience with the 6205 led the designers of the first models of PDP-10, the KA10 and KI10, to use only small boards. It was not until the KL10 that large boards were used again.

===Operating system===
The PDP-6 supported time-sharing through the use of a status bit selecting between two operating modes (&quot;Executive&quot; and &quot;User&quot;, with access to input/output (I/O), etc., being restricted in the latter), and a single relocation/protection register which allowed a user&#x27;s address space to be limited to a set section of main memory (a second relocation/protection register for shareable &quot;high segments&quot; was added on the PDP-10). The main operating system used on the machine was an early version of what later became TOPS-10, and several sites made custom versions of the system, which was available in source code form. MIT&#x27;s Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) operating system also began on the PDP-6.

Although it was possible to time-share a PDP-6 without a disk drive, configuring it with four dual DECtape drives &quot;could effectively support about 4-6 simultaneous users.&quot; The same system, with a single disk drive, resulted in &quot;real time-sharing (and) could easily handle 20-30 users.&quot;

==Museum==
Stanford&#x27;s PDP-6 was shown at DECUS in 1984. The machine was transferred to a DEC warehouse after that event. There are no records of this machine being given to the Computer Museum, which was not part of DEC in 1984. In the late 1990s Compaq donated the contents of the DEC internal archives to The Computer Museum History Center. The Fast Memory cabinet from the Stanford PDP-6 was part of that donation. There is no evidence that the modules sold at the Boston computer museum gift shop were from the Stanford PDP-6, nor is there any evidence that the museum had ever had this machine in its possession.

<text>Roger Vailland (; 16 October 1907 – 12 May 1965) was a French novelist, essayist, and screenwriter.

==Biography==
Vailland was born in Acy-en-Multien, Oise. His novels include the prize winning &quot;Drôle de jeu&quot; (1945), &quot;Les mauvais coups&quot; (1948), &quot;Un jeune homme seul&quot; (1951), &quot;325 000 francs&quot; (1955), and &quot;La loi&quot; (1957), winner of the Prix Goncourt. His screenplays include &quot;Les liaisons dangereuses&quot; (with Claude Brûlé and Roger Vadim, 1959) and &quot;Le vice et la vertu&quot; (with Vadim, 1962). He died, aged 57, in Meillonnas, Ain.

Vailland took part in the French Resistance during Nazi occupation. &quot;Drôle de jeu&quot; (Playing with Fire) is considered one of the finest novels about the anti-fascist Resistance. Vailland joined the French Communist Party but resigned after the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He remained an independent leftist for the rest of his life.

<doc id="218832" wikidata="Q2245980" url="?curid=218832" title="Ribot (horse)">
<text>Ribot (27 February 1952 – 28 April 1972) was a British-bred, Italian-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who won all his 16 races, including the Arc de Triomphe twice. He raced from 5 furlongs (1,000m) to 1m 7f (3,000m) in three countries on all types of track conditions. He is considered by many experts to be one of the best horses ever.

He was the best Italian two-year-old of 1954, when his three wins included the Gran Criterium. He won his first four races of 1955 in Italy before being sent to France where he won the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. In the following year, he recorded wide-margin victories in both the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

Ribot was then retired to stud where he proved to be a highly successful breeding stallion. The performances of Ribot&#x27;s progeny saw him become the leading sire in Great Britain &amp; Ireland on three occasions (1963, 1967, 1968).

==Breeding==
Ribot was bred by Italy&#x27;s leading Thoroughbred breeder, Federico Tesio, who personally bred six of the horses that appeared in the first three generations of Ribot&#x27;s pedigree. Ribot was foaled at the English National Stud at Newmarket, Suffolk on 27 February 1952. He was sired by Tenerani an outstanding Italian racehorse whose most notable international success came when he defeated the French champion Arbar in the 1948 Goodwood Cup. Ribot&#x27;s dam Romanella was a successful broodmare who also produced the Premio Regina Elena winner Rossellina and the Premio Parioli winner Raeburn.

He was described as being a &quot;medium-sized bay with a lovely intelligent head and a perfect temperament. The secret of his success was probably his depth through the heart and there was not a girth at Dormello to fit him.&quot; Like many of Tesio&#x27;s horses, Ribot was named after an artist—in this case, the French realist Théodule-Augustin Ribot. Tesio, who also bred the undefeated and prepotent sire Nearco, did not live to see Ribot develop into a champion. After Tesio&#x27;s death in May 1954, Ribot was raced by Tesio&#x27;s widow Donna Lydia and his business partner, Marchese Mario Incisa della Rocchetta.

Ribot was trained in Italy by Ugo Penco and ridden by Enrico Camici. He was nicknamed &#x27;il cavallo super,&#x27; meaning &#x27;the super horse&#x27;.

==Racing record==

===1954 two-year-old season===
In 1954 Ribot began his racing career by winning the Premio Tramuschio over 1,000m at San Siro Racecourse by one length. He then won the Criterium Nazionale over 1,200m at the same course by two lengths. He ended the season by running the Gran Criterium over 1,500m at San Siro. In this race Camici attempted to ride a waiting race and Ribot won narrowly by a head from Gail. In all his subsequent races he either led from the start or raced close to the leaders.

===1955 three-year-old season===
Ribot had been unusually small as a yearling, being nicknamed &quot;il piccolo&quot; (little one). As a result, he was never entered in races such as the Premio Parioli and the Derby Italiano.

In 1955 Ribot won the Premio Pisa at Pisa Racecourse by six lengths and then took the Premio Emanuele Filiberto at San Siro by 10 lengths. After a break to allow the colt to recover from a respiratory illness he won the Premio Brembo by one length from Derain, and the Premio Besana over 2,400m by 10 lengths, again beating Derain, who won the St Leger Italiano two weeks later.

In October he raced outside Italy for the first time when he contested the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe over 2,400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting at odds of 9/1 he took the lead early in the straight and won by three lengths from Beau Prince. According to press reports, he won very easily, with Camici never resorting to the whip and restraining the colt rather than driving him out in the closing stages. After the race he was surrounded by photographers and given the attention normally reserved for Hollywood film-stars. In his final start of the year he returned to Italy, where he won the Gran Premio del Jockey Club by 15 lengths from the previous year&#x27;s winner Norman on heavy going.

===1956 four-year-old season===
Ribot began his four-year-old season with three easy wins at San Siro. He won the Premio Giulio Venino over 2,000 metres by four lengths, the Premio Vittuone over 2,400 metres by twelve lengths and the Premio Garbagnate over 2,000 metres by eight lengths from Grand Rapids. He then contested Italy&#x27;s Premier weight-for-age race, the Gran Premio di Milano, then run over 3,000 metres, at the San Siro. He led from the start and won by eight lengths from Tissot.

In July, Ribot raced outside Italy for the second time when he was sent to England for the sixth running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. Racing on soft ground, he started the 2/5 favourite and won by five lengths from High Veldt and Todrai. His fourteenth consecutive victory saw him equal the record of the pre-War Italian champion Nearco. Ribot then returned to Milan, where he won the Premio del Piazzale over 1,800 metres, winning by eight lengths from a field which included the Premio Parioli winner Magabait.

In October, Ribot returned to Paris for his second Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. He faced a stronger field than in 1955, with the field including Talgo (Irish Derby), Tanerko, Fisherman, Career Boy, Master Boing (Washington, D.C. International) and Oroso. Ribot took the lead on the turn into the straight and drew away from the field to win by an official margin of six lengths from Talgo. Photographs suggest that the winning margin was more like eight and a half lengths.

==Stud record==
Retired from racing, Ribot had a very successful career at stud. Under a one-year contract, he first stood at Lord Derby&#x27;s stud in England. In 1959, he was syndicated for a five-year lease at a cost of $1.35 million before being sent to the United States in a deal of such significance that, in June 1959, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; did a feature article on it.

Originally, Ribot was leased by Darby Dan to stand in the United States for five years. After his temper surfaced, no insurance company would offer a policy to cover shipping him back to Europe. A new contract was worked out, and Ribot remained in the United States until his death. He is buried in the equine cemetery at Darby Dan, near his sons Graustark and His Majesty.

He was leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland on three occasions (1963, 1967 and 1968). His European progeny included Molvedo and Prince Royal, both winners of the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, and Ragusa, winner of the Irish Derby, St. Leger, King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Eclipse Stakes. In America he sired Long Look, winner of Epsom Oaks; the full brothers Ribocco and Ribero, both winners of the Irish Derby and St. Leger; Boucher, the winner of the 1972 St Leger; Tom Rolfe, winner of the 1965 Preakness Stakes; Arts and Letters, winner of the 1969 Belmont Stakes; and Graustark. Ribot&#x27;s son His Majesty sired the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Pleasant Colony. His great grandson Alleged, by Tom Rolfe&#x27;s son Hoist The Flag, emulated him by winning the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in successive years (1977 and 1978).

At least 15 Ribot stallions stood in Australasia, including Arivederci, Angeluccio, Latin Lover, Boucher (USA), Dies, Ribollire, Heir Apparent, Koryo, Regent&#x27;s Tale, Ruantallan, Ribotlight and Headland. The progeny of the 15 imported stallions had won over A$7 million until late 1979.

==Assessment==
Timeform awarded Ribot a rating of 133 in 1955, six pounds behind the British-trained sprinter Pappa Fourway. In 1956 he was given a rating of 142, making him the highest-rated horse in Europe.

&quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, written by John Randall and Tony Morris, states that photographs show Sea-Bird winning the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe by only four and a half lengths (and not by the official six lengths). Thus, they argue that Ribot&#x27;s triumph (correctly by eight and half lengths and not by an official six lengths) in the race is de facto the largest winning distance. Randall and Morris rate Ribot the third-best racehorse of the 20th century, behind Sea Bird and Secretariat.

In La Gazzetta dello Sport&#x27;s poll, Ribot was named the fourth-greatest Italian athlete of the 20th century. The Premio Ribot at Capannelle Racecourse is named in his honour, and he has been named Horse of the Century in Italy.

<text>Dan Patch (April 29, 1896 – July 11, 1916) was a noted American Standardbred pacer. At a time when harness racing was one of the largest sports in the nation, Dan Patch was a major celebrity. He was undefeated in open competition, and was so dominant on the racetrack that other owners eventually refused to enter their horses against him. Instead, he ended his racing career performing time trials, and traveled extensively on exhibition, earning millions of dollars in purses, attendance gate receipts, and product endorsements. Dan Patch broke world speed records at least 14 times in the early 1900s. In 1905, he set a world&#x27;s record for the fastest mile by a harness horse (1:55 – 1 minute, seconds) that stood unmatched for over 30 years. Unofficially, Dan Patch broke this record in 1906 with a clocking of 1:55. He died on July 11, 1916. His owner, Marion Willis Savage, died just one day later.

Dan Patch was inducted into the Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame in 1953 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Background==

Dan Patch was a mahogany bay Standardbred stallion bred by Daniel (Dan) Messner Jr., a prosperous dry goods merchant from Oxford, Indiana. In late 1894, Messner purchased a three-year-old filly named Zelica for $255 (equal to $ today), planning to use her as a buggy horse. Zelica had gone lame in her only start and was later estimated to be worth under $100 at the time. In 1895, Messner paid a $150 stud fee to breed her to Joe Patchen, a top-quality racehorse, but untried as a sire. The resulting colt was foaled on April 29, 1896, at the livery stable in Oxford. His legs were so crooked that he could not at first stand on his own, leading many of the locals to call him &quot;Messner&#x27;s Folly&quot;. Some even suggested he be put down. Instead, Messner and his friends held the colt so he could ingest the colostrum (first milk) from Zelica. The foal&#x27;s legs gradually grew straighter, although he still had crooked hocks, especially on his left hind leg. The colt developed an alert, cheerful personality and was noted for his intelligence.

In 1897, Messner applied to the American Trotting Association for the name Dan Patchen, based on his own first name and the last name of the colt&#x27;s sire, with Dan P. as an alternative. Both names were taken, so the Trotting Association assigned a similar name, Dan Patch.

Zelica continued to be used as a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. &quot;The only redeemable feature about the little fellow was that he was friendly and cute,&quot; recalled Messner. &quot;I honestly thought the colt&#x27;s future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon.&quot; However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse&#x27;s abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse, since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, who loved to move fast, but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.

At maturity, Dan Patch stood tall at the withers and weighed a &quot;hefty&quot; 1,165 pounds. His hindquarters were notably higher than his front. He had a short body and long legs, a combination that would have been problematic for a trotter, as the hind legs would have risked striking the front leg in full stride (known as firing). As a pacer, the risk of firing is nonexistent, as the front and hind legs on a given side move back and forth together. However, because of the crooked hock on his left hind, Dan Patch would initially &quot;cross fire&quot;, meaning his left hind leg would sometimes hit his right fore. A special horseshoe was used on his left hind to stabilize the leg, resulting in a smooth, rhythmical stride. The left leg would still sometimes &quot;paddle&quot; wide though, striking the wheel of the training cart. Wattles resolved this problem by designing a wider sulky.

===Ownership===
Messner was the owner of a dry-goods store in Oxford and traveled extensively as a buyer of clothing and fabrics and other items for his growing business. During these trips, he frequently went to the harness races and probably made small bets with his friends. Despite his long-standing interest in the sport, Zelica was the first horse he ever owned.

In 1902, Messner sold Dan Patch to Manley E. Sturges (sometimes spelled Sturgis) of New York, for a record $20,000. Sturges first became interested in Dan Patch in 1901 when he placed a large bet on the horse in a race at Brighton Beach. Sturges was the part owner and operator of an illegal, but highly profitable, casino in Manhattan, the Victoria Club. Although the casino was frequently raided, Sturges was never arrested and maintained a low profile. He made his first offer for Dan Patch in the summer of 1901, and was finally successful in February 1902. At that time, Messner cited many reasons for the sale, including the record price and the pressure of running his store. Years later, however, Messner said that he had felt threatened by Sturges. A two-year-old daughter of Dan Patch died suddenly in February 1902, apparently from poisoning, and Messner believed that Sturges was responsible.

In turn, Sturges sold Dan Patch in December 1902 to Marion Willis Savage, a resident of Hamilton (later Savage) Minnesota, for the then unheard of price of $60,000 (). Savage was the owner of the International Stock Food Company, which specialized in feed supplements for animals, and used the horse to advertise the business. Savage took great pride in his champion and was reported as saying he loved Dan Patch like a son. When not on exhibition, Dan Patch lived in Minnesota, either in the stable of Savage&#x27;s Minneapolis mansion or at Savage&#x27;s sprawling farm in Hamilton in an extravagant stable known as the &quot;Taj Mahal&quot;.

==Racing career==
Dan Patch made his first start as a four-year-old in 1900. At the time, harness races consisted of multiple heats – a horse had to win a majority of heats (usually three out of a possible five heats) to be declared the race winner. During his career, Dan Patch never lost a race and lost only two heats. The first of those two losses occurred in his second start against what was termed &quot;real competition&quot; at the Lafayette Fair. In that heat, Dan Patch was last at the beginning of the homestretch and despite closing rapidly, lost by a nose. The other loss occurred in 1901 at Brighton Beach in a heat where the judges determined that the driver was &quot;not driving to win&quot;, much to the fury of the crowd.

===1900: Indiana county fairs===
Wattles began training Dan Patch in earnest at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before his first start in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and Wattles with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who did not seem to be working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was no better than the next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford, who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch did not disappoint, winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. Wattles had not pushed the colt, wanting to be able to stay at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.

With only five days of rest, Dan Patch made his next start at the Lafayette Fair for a purse of $300. Although the race was still at the 2:35 level, the competition was much stiffer. With a field of nine horses, five or six horses started in the first tier, while Dan Patch started in the second tier. Dan Patch was jostled and trapped at the back of the field until Wattles finally found racing room as they entered the homestretch. Dan Patch closed rapidly but just missed in a heat timed at 2:18. Although some blamed Wattles for the loss (either due to inexperience or in an effort to drive up the odds), Wattles himself blamed it on a new harness. Regardless, Dan Patch proved his superiority by winning the next three heats, the fastest of which was completed in 2:16.

On September 12, Dan Patch took the winner&#x27;s share of another purse worth $300 at the fair in Crawfordsville in three straight heats in times of 2:19, 2:20 and 2:20. The following week, the horse was asked for a little more effort in a $400 race at the Brazil fair. He responded with times of 2:16, 2:19 and 2:17. Messner had hoped to end the year at the Terre Haute fair but heavy rains forced the cancellation of the race. Dan Patch ended the year with four wins and earnings of $625.

===1901: the Grand Circuit===

In 1901, Messner decided to test Dan Patch against the best horses in the country on the Grand Circuit, a series of valuable races around the north-eastern United States. Accordingly, he hired Myron McHenry to be Dan Patch&#x27;s new trainer and driver. Though McHenry was reputed to be difficult to work with, his ability with horses was such that he was called &quot;America&#x27;s greatest reinsman&quot;. On May 13, Dan Patch left Oxford on a train bound for Cleveland so that McHenry could try him out. In their first drive together, Dan Patch did not appear to be working hard but the stopwatch showed he had been moving fast. McHenry reportedly said to the horse, &quot;You&#x27;re either the world&#x27;s biggest counterfeit, or you&#x27;re the fastest horse in the world.&quot;

McHenry worked with Dan Patch for two months before the start of the Grand Circuit season. Although he had been trained well by Wattles, he still had some gaiting issues associated with his conformation. McHenry had the toe of Dan Patch&#x27;s feet trimmed short while using a shoe that was raised in the back, a combination that some observers said made the horse look like he was wearing high heels. Despite the odd appearance, the shoeing improved on the earlier changes made by Wattles to keep Dan Patch&#x27;s hind legs from interfering with his front legs while reducing the wide action that led to him sometimes striking the wheels of the sulky. Always a natural pacer who required no hobbles or special equipment to keep him on stride, Dan Patch soon attracted interest from observers of the training sessions.

He made his first start with McHenry at the racetrack in Windsor, Ontario, on July 10 in a race for 2:15 level pacers. With a purse of $600, the race was meant to serve as a modest test for a horse whose official best time was 2:16. Dan Patch won in three straight heats, the fastest of which was completed in 2:07.

On July 17 in Detroit, he made his first start on the Grand Circuit at the Grosse Pointe racetrack. Although he faced some steep competition, he again won easily in straight heats. The Grand Circuit continued in Cleveland, Columbus, and Buffalo with Dan Patch continuing to build his reputation with one win after the other. In the Buffalo race, McHenry took Dan Patch to the back of the field in one of the heats, then unleashed him in the stretch. He responded with a final quarter mile in 30 seconds, a noteworthy fraction at a time when only one pacer had ever broken the two-minute barrier for the mile. McHenry told reporters, &quot;Dan Patch is the best pacer I&#x27;ve ever drawn a rein over.&quot;

Dan Patch made his next start on August 16 at the Brighton Beach racetrack in New York City, known as a gambling hotbed. He was the heavy favorite to win the race, but his odds to win the first heat drifted up from 3/5 to 5/4, attracting a &quot;mad scramble&quot; from bettors looking to cash in. The start of the first heat was delayed by over an hour due to an equipment malfunction. When the race began, Dan Patch went to the early lead but was then eased back. In the homestretch, he was given &quot;modest&quot; encouragement but failed to close enough ground, finishing fourth. Bettors were incensed, believing McHenry did not drive to win, possibly after having tipped the bookmakers given the way the odds changed before the race. The time for the heat was 2:09, two seconds slower than Dan Patch&#x27;s best time to date. McHenry stated that he had held back because he had heard that the winner was fast and he wanted to see how things sorted out. Some reports say the judges paid no attention to the &quot;improbable&quot; result. However, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that the judges were &quot;very displeased&quot; and others reported on a heated meeting of the officials and a near riot by the fans.

In the second heat, Dan Patch won in a time of 2:04, a new personal best. Because of the delay in the start of the first heat and another delay due to protests over its result, the third heat was not run until the next day. Dan Patch again won easily, this time in 2:07 before winning the fourth and final heat in 2:05.

His next start was at the Readville racetrack in Boston on August 22. The &quot;Globe&quot; reporter noted that Dan Patch was clearly superior to the field while the race result would be &quot;as close as McHenry cares to draw the finishes.&quot; No betting was allowed, and Dan Patch won easily in straight heats. Following the race, he developed a cough but still raced on August 30 at the Narragansett Trotting Park in Cranston, Rhode Island on August 30. Pushed in the first heat to a time of 2:04, he won the next two heats and was reported to have made a deep bow to the crowd after the race.

Dan Patch followed up with routine wins in Hartford, Cincinnati, Lexington, and Memphis. All told, he won 12 races in 1901. He was supposed to finish the season at the Terre Haute meet, but no one would enter against him. Instead, he returned home on November 2. On November 14, Oxford held the first &quot;Dan Patch Day&quot;, in which the horse was led around town to the tune of the newly written &quot;Dan Patch Two Step&quot;.

===1902: new ownership===

Dan Patch started 1902 in Indiana with his backers speculating just how fast he could go, as he had thus far only paced as hard as needed to win. The &quot;Oxford Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;It does not seem possible to those of our town who see this beautiful stallion, as gentle as a Newfoundland dog, driven about every fine day for exercise, that they are looking at the pacing king of the world.&quot; Townsfolk hoped that &quot;Daniel&quot; would be able to attend the upcoming Fourth of July celebrations.

In a surprising development, Dan Patch was sold to Manley Sturges in February, and was relocated to New York with McHenry remaining as his driver. His first start of the year was in Windsor, Ontario, in a match race against Canadian pacer Harold H., followed by races in Grosse Pointe and Cleveland on the Grand Circuit. In these wins, he was so dominant that subsequently either owners refused to race their horses against him or tracks were unwilling to allow betting. Sturges&#x27;s only alternative was to have Dan Patch compete against the clock in exhibition races. Dan Patch paced his first public time trial on August 2 in Columbus and made headlines by surpassing the mark of his sire with a time of 2:00. This was second only to Star Pointer&#x27;s world record of 1:59, a time that now looked achievable.

Over the summer and fall, interest in Dan Patch continued to grow, with racetracks negotiating with McHenry to have the horse appear. Dan Patch paced a mile in 2:00 at Brighton Beach despite high winds, then lowered his personal best to 2:00 at Readville. On August 29, Dan Patch just missed the world record with a time of 1:59 at Providence. After strong attempts in Philadelphia, Syracuse and Empire City, Dan Patch finally tied Star Pointer&#x27;s world record on September 29 at Readville. He rounded out the year with exhibitions before enormous crowds at Cincinnati, Terre Haute, Davenport and Memphis.

Marion Savage became one of Dan Patch&#x27;s biggest fans and made multiple offers to Sturges for the horse. Savage finally succeeded in December with an offer of $60,000, then a staggering amount.

===1903: &quot;champion harness horse of the world&quot;===
Savage was known for his advertising skills and soon capitalized on Dan Patch&#x27;s growing fame. Rather than charging an exhibition fee, Savage received a proportion of the gate receipts for crowds that grew to between 40 and 50 thousand. In most of his exhibition races, Dan Patch started behind galloping horses who were hooked up to a sulky, which gave Dan Patch a target to beat and also acted as a wind breaker. The pace makers would eventually swing wide, leaving Dan Patch alone against the clock.

Not long after buying Dan Patch, Savage entered him in the Minneapolis Riding and Driving Club&#x27;s winter horse show held on January 29, 1903. The &quot;champion harness horse of the world&quot; was given the chance to show his paces on a snowy Park avenue. Savage scheduled other special appearances for Dan Patch throughout the spring before finally handing him over to McHenry for serious training in June. Dan Patch made his first major appearance of 1903 in a time trial at Columbus on July 17. Despite being short of conditioning and pacing into a headwind, Dan Patch tied Prince Alert&#x27;s world record for the half mile of 57 seconds. Although far less famous, Prince Alert was the only other active horse to have broken the two minute barrier for the mile and might have given Dan Patch a serious battle had the two ever met head to head. Instead, the two tried to outdo each other racing against the clock.

Dan Patch&#x27;s next notable achievement was on August 19 at Brighton Beach, where he broke the world record by pacing a mile in 1:59 despite cold and windy conditions. This was the first time the race format had used galloping Thoroughbreds to prompt the pace, with one running beside Dan Patch at the start and the other behind. The effort was nearly derailed when Dan Patch came close to clipping the rail when moving into the first turn, while his running mates swept wide and were left behind. Dan Patch completed the half-mile in :59 before one of the pacemakers caught up, then moved in front. His time for the three-quarters was 1:29, just off of world record pace. McHenry urged Dan Patch hard down the homestretch and he responded with a final quarter mile in under 30 seconds to set the record.

Dan Patch next tackled the record for one mile on a half-mile track. Because the horse must negotiate more and tighter turns on a smaller track, the half-mile track record is slower than the time on a one-mile track. Even today, separate records are kept in harness racing depending on the track dimensions. On September 7 at the half-mile track in Lima, Ohio, Dan Patch paced a world record of 2:04, only to have the record broken by Prince Alert a few weeks later. Prince Alert then lowered the world record on a one-mile track to an astonishing 1:57, thanks in part to perfect weather conditions but also aided by a large canvas sail carried between the galloping horses who set the pace. Critics pointed out that the sail, later referred to as a wind shield, lessened the wind resistance that a horse faced (similar to drafting in cycling or motor racing). Although the usage of wind shields was eventually disallowed by the American Trotting Register, in the short term it meant that Dan Patch was no longer the fastest harness horse in the world.

Dan Patch responded to the challenge by setting a flurry of records. In Lexington, he broke the existing record for pacing while attached to a wagon, instead of the lighter, more aerodynamic sulky, by over two seconds. A week later in Memphis, he regained the one mile world from Prince Alert with a time of 1:56, an accomplishment that made the first page of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Dan Patch maintained a steady pace, completing the first quarter mile in 29 seconds, the first half in 58 seconds and the three-quarters in 1:37. McHenry had used only a small canvas strip between the wheels of his pacemaker&#x27;s sulky that McHenry called a dust shield, compared to the much larger wind shield carried between two pacemakers used by Prince Alert.

On October 27 while still in Memphis, he set two world records within 45 minutes of each other. In the first trial, he lowered the record for the half mile from 57 seconds to 56 seconds flat. In the second, he lowered his own record for a mile pacing to wagon from 1:59 to 1:57.

Dan Patch made two further appearances in 1903. At Birmingham, Alabama on November 10, he lowered the record for a mile on a half mile track to 2:03, even though his pacemaker had moved too far ahead to act as a proper windshield. The conditions in Macon, Georgia on November 30 were cold and windy but Dan Patch still set two world records within an hour of each other. In the first, he was attached to an old-fashioned high-wheeled sulky and lowered the existing record by seconds. In the second, he paced two miles in 4:17, lowering the existing record by two seconds.

===1904: on the road===

In 1904, Savage split company with McHenry, who had been Dan Patch&#x27;s trainer and driver since 1901. A variety of reasons were cited, including McHenry&#x27;s drinking and his complaints that Savage was treating Dan Patch like a circus act. Savage replaced McHenry with Harry Hersey, who had been the manager of Savage&#x27;s farm in Minnesota but had little race-driving experience. Savage had no inclination to test Dan Patch in competitive formats, where even the fastest horse can lose due to a variety of factors. Instead, Savage used Dan Patch to promote the horse feed supplements his company produced and, in the model of Buffalo Bill Cody&#x27;s Wild West Show, turned each appearance by Dan Patch into a major event. Dan Patch was shipped in a custom built rail-car, with half of the space reserved for Dan Patch and the other half for his grooms and the horses used as prompters. Savage estimated that Dan Patch traveled roughly 10,000 miles in 1904 alone.

Dan Patch did not make his seasonal debut for 1904 until August 11 in Indianapolis and his first performances were considered disappointing, well off his personal best. Despite this, the crowds though continued to grow, reaching 40,000 in Des Moines and 50,000 in Milwaukee. He was then scheduled to make an appearance in Topeka on the September 14 and arrived in town a few days early. After a workout on the 12th, he cooled out normally but later started to show signs of distress. The condition quickly deteriorated and a respected veterinarian diagnosed a strangulated hernia, which had a very high fatality rate at the time since abdominal surgery on horses was not then an option. Hersey sent two telegraphs on hearing the news: one to Savage and the other to the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;. While Savage rushed to Dan Patch&#x27;s side, news went out across America that the horse was dying.

On his arrival in Kansas on the 13th, Savage called in other veterinarians, one of whom felt that the condition was actually an impacted bowel – still serious but much more survivable. For the next few days, newspapers updated on Dan Patch&#x27;s slowly improving condition until the horse was finally pronounced out of danger on September 29. Savage had administered triple doses of &quot;International Colic Cure&quot;, one of his company&#x27;s feed supplements, and later said this helped Dan Patch&#x27;s recovery, though he did not claim that it actually cured the colic. Some skeptics wondered if Savage had manufactured the crisis for the resulting publicity, though this seems unlikely since he was not present when the horse first became ill. Dan Patch made a brief appearance before the crowd in Topeka before being shipped home to Minnesota. He was given a brief time off before attending a previously scheduled event on October 7 at the Illinois State Fair, where 50,000 people turned out to see the &quot;national pet&quot;.

His next scheduled appearance was in Memphis, Tennessee, where little was expected of him due to the recent illness. On October 24, he paced a mile without prompters in 2:00, the fastest time paced that year despite appearing &quot;dull and weak&quot; to his old owner Manley Sturges. Just two days later though, Dan Patch returned in much better condition. Behind his galloping prompter, he paced the first quarter mile in 29 seconds and completed the first half in 57 seconds. He seemed to falter around the far turn, but still completed the three-quarters in 1:26. In the stretch, he recovered his best stride and completed the mile in a new world record of 1:56. He was greeted with an ovation and Hersey was carried from the sulky on the way back to the stands.

Dan Patch finished the year with appearances in St. Louis, Oklahoma City and Dallas. At Oklahoma City, he broke his own record for one mile on a half-mile track with a time of 2:03, despite &quot;dreadful&quot; track conditions that caused Dan Patch to nearly fall. Hersey said, &quot;It was the most wonderful mile ever paced by a horse.&quot; The crowd concurred – according to a reporter, &quot;Canes, hats, and coats filled the air.&quot;

===1905: the Black Whirlwind===
Dan Patch celebrated his ninth birthday in 1905, an age at which racehorses are considered past their prime. From this point onward, the expectation that he would set a new record on any given trial was lower, but the horse&#x27;s popularity remained intact. Dan Patch made his first appearance of the year in September at the Minnesota State Fair before a crowd of 98,000, followed by a crowd of 55,000 at Indianapolis and more than 100,000 in Allentown. He then shipped to Lexington, where he tied his own world record of 1:56 while surrounded by a cloud of dust, leading the &quot;New York Times&quot; to call him the &quot;Black Whirlwind&quot;. Two days later, Dan Patch outdid himself, setting his official record of 1:55, a time that would remain a record for over 30 years.

Savage then decided to tackle the record for an unprompted mile, which still stood at 1:59. The harness racing community was becoming increasingly concerned about the use of prompters and wind shields, so Savage wished to establish that Dan Patch could break Star Pointer&#x27;s old record without assistance. After several attempts that were close to or matched that time, Dan Patch finally shattered the &quot;in the open&quot; record with a time of 1:58 at Memphis on November 11.

===1906-1909: celebrity===

In 1906, the National Trotting Association banned the use of wind shields, although they did allow Dan Patch&#x27;s 1905 records to stand. Thus, his official best mile is 1:55. Unofficially, his best time was 1:55, paced in September 1906 at the Minnesota State Fair. Savage was so indignant about the 1:55 mark not being recognized that he renamed his International Stock Food Farm to the International 1:55 Stock Food Farm. Savage later used Dan Patch and his offspring in ads for the farm, with the 1:55 time clearly included. The 1:55 mark was equaled in following years but was not broken until 1960, 54 years after Dan Patch&#x27;s run, when Adios Butler paced the first sub-1:55 mile in 1:54:3.

Although Dan Patch continued to make public appearances and posted some excellent times, he was never able to achieve that level again. The closest he came was on October 11, 1908, at Lexington, when he paced the first three-quarters of a mile in an exceptional 1:25 before his prompter started bleeding and slowed down. Dan Patch was forced to check but still finished the mile in 1:56. Savage advertised that Dan Patch would otherwise have finished in 1:54, which &quot;the Horse Papers and all Horsemen admit was the Fastest and Greatest Performance in the life of the World Famous Harness Horse King.&quot;

Dan Patch&#x27;s achievements made him a sports celebrity, possibly the most famous athlete in America until Babe Ruth. His name and likeness were used to sell a vast array of merchandise including whiskey bottles, shot glasses, cigars, coffee, billiard cues, sheet music, chewing tobacco, toothpicks, playing cards, liniments, stable disinfectants, knives, washing machines, sewing machines, and manure spreaders. At the height of his fame, he earned more than $1 million a year for his owner and was billed as &quot;kindhearted, generous, and a staunch Methodist who never performed on a Sunday.&quot;

Among the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out for a glimpse of the horse over his career was Dwight Eisenhower, who lined up with his parents at the 1904 Kansas State Fair. Harry Truman recalled that as a boy he had written a fan letter to the horse.

==Records set==
==Retirement==

Dan Patch retired undefeated in 1909 as the holder of nine world records, and spent much of his later life attending exhibitions. Even during his racing career, he was used for stallion duty with a stud fee of between $300 and $500, though he was never exposed to the best mares. He had a moderately successful stud career but never sired a horse close to his ability. He sired 38 trotters who met the 2m:30s standard with 1 breaking 2:10. He also sired 138 pacers who met the standard, 5 of whom broke the 2:05 barrier. Dazzle Patch was his most successful son but died young and left only a few foals behind. Dan Patch&#x27;s name is rare in modern pedigrees. His most famous descendant is Hall of Famer Jate Lobell, who traces to Dan Patch&#x27;s daughter Theda Patch in the female line.

In July 1916, Savage went into the hospital for minor hemorrhoid surgery. At the same time, Dan Patch suffered an attack of colic, from which he soon seemed to recover. However, at 10:00 AM on July 11, Dan Patch collapsed, thrashed his legs in a pacing motion and then died of a massive heart attack. Savage was notified and indicated that he wished to have Dan Patch stuffed and mounted. Before this could be done, Savage died on July 12 of a pulmonary embolism.

==Memorials==

Dan Patch is believed to be buried somewhere on the &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; property in an unmarked grave – the tombstone in Oxford is just a memorial. Dan Patch&#x27;s home town of Oxford continues to honor the horse at its annual &quot;Dan Patch Days&quot; festival, a festival that is scheduled for the weekend following Labor Day each year. Savage, Minnesota, also holds a celebration called &quot;Dan Patch Days&quot; annually in June.

Today, the land in Savage formerly occupied by the Taj Mahal stables and racetracks is vacant, though the outline of a track is visible from the air, near the intersection of State Highway 13 and Vernon Avenue. The land is posted &quot;no trespassing&quot; and no historical marker documents that anything of significance ever stood there.

In 1953, Dan Patch was inducted in the new Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame.

The City of Savage, Minnesota, was renamed for Dan Patch&#x27;s owner, Marion Willis Savage, in 1904. Dan Patch Avenue on the Minnesota State Fair grounds is named for the horse. Dan Patch Drive and Dan Patch Lane in Savage, Minnesota, are also named after Dan Patch.

In 1992, the Dan Patch Historical Society was formed to &quot;collect, preserve and disseminate information about the horse&quot;. In 1997, it helped set up a Heritage Room in the Savage Public Library, which contains two display cases of Dan Patch memorabilia and extensive records.

In 2004, Prior Lake High School, located in Savage, named its new stadium after the horse.

In 2019, Dan Patch was named into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

In a display on the exterior of the Indiana State Museum, Benton County (where Dan Patch&#x27;s hometown of Oxford is located) is represented by a wire sculpture of Dan Patch. The road into Oxford is named the Dan Patch highway and there are several tributes to the horse including an historical marker showing his birthplace.

==Cultural references==
The brass era automobile maker Dan Patch was founded in Minneapolis in 1911. The company was owned by Savage and was one of 16 manufacturers in Minnesota at the time. This operation came to an end when the Ford Motor Company began its assembly operations in St. Paul.
The proposed Dan Patch Corridor commuter rail line in southern Minnesota runs along the tracks of the former Dan Patch line, created in 1907 by Marion W. Savage. Passenger service on the Dan Patch line began the summer of 1910, with travel from Bloomington, Minnesota to Minneapolis. Savage&#x27;s plan of running rail through to Iowa never materialized as the citizens of Faribault, Minnesota would have nothing to do with it. The railroad was declared bankrupt in 1917 and purchased a year later. Savage&#x27;s track however would spur growth along all the cities it lay and service industries like Ford, John Deere and Thermo King.

Dan Patch Toastmasters, Club 1280 of Toastmasters International, was founded in 1954, and continues to meet on Wednesday evenings in Richfield, Minnesota.

The song &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot;, from the Broadway musical and film &quot;The Music Man&quot;, makes a reference to the horse in expounding upon the &quot;degradation&quot; of jockeys sitting on the horse during a race, when Harold Hill (Robert Preston) states:

Dan Patch was the subject of the 1949 motion picture &quot;The Great Dan Patch&quot; starring Dennis O&#x27;Keefe and Gail Russell.

The Disney movie &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; begins with Dan Patch&#x27;s train pulling into a small town. Jeremiah&#x27;s black lamb, Danny, is named for the horse and serves as his inspiration.

==Pedigree==

In 1879, the harness racing community established &quot;The Standard&quot;, which stated that a Standardbred was a horse who either: (a) could trot a mile in 2:30, or (b) was the offspring of such a horse. Both Dan Patch&#x27;s parents were Standardbreds but further back in his pedigree are a significant number of Morgan horses. Even further back can be found Thoroughbreds (most notably Messenger, the great-grandfather of Hambletonian) and a wide variety of harness horse breeds including the Narragansett Pacer, Canadian Pacer, Norfolk Trotter and Hackney.

Dan Patch was from the first crop of Joe Patchen, one of the fastest pacers of his time. Joe Patchen&#x27;s main rival was Star Pointer, the first Standardbred to break the two minute barrier. Joe Patchen was a great-grandson of Standardbred foundation sire Hambletonian (known more fully as Hambletonian 10 or Rysdyk&#x27;s Hambletonian to distinguish him from the Thoroughbred of the same name). Hambletonian sired 40 trotters who met the standard, with several going on to be influential sires. His son George Wilkes raced for twelve years, winning 29 of 67 races. Known for his ill temper, he was initially greeted with indifference at stud but soon became one of the greatest sires of his age. One of George Wilkes&#x27;s less distinguished sons was Patchen Wilkes, who barely met the standard with a best time of 2:29. Patchen Wilkes&#x27;s only important offspring was a colt produced by the half Morgan, half Standardbred mare Josephine Young and named Joe Patchen after his parents. Though mixed, Joe Patchen was a great pacer with a career best of 2:01. This likely had a great deal to do with Josephine Young&#x27;s sire being trotter Joe Young (2:18), a successful racing horse from Peabody, Kansas. Other than Dan Patch, Joe Patchen was not a great success at stud.

Dan Patch&#x27;s dam Zelica was sired by Wilkesberry, also a grandson of George Wilkes through one of his best sons, Young Jim. Wilkesberry was a talented horse who died young and left only a few foals. Zelica&#x27;s dam Abdallah Belle descended from Alexander&#x27;s Abdallah, a son of Hambletonian who also died young and left few survivors due to the Civil War. Zelica produced several foals after Dan Patch but they were fairly undistinguished.

‡ Morgan horse

* Dan Patch is inbred 3S × 4D to the stallion George Wilkes, meaning that he appears third generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.

<doc id="218837" wikidata="Q1184065" url="?curid=218837" title="Delegation">
<text>Delegation is the process of distributing and entrusting work to another person. In management or leadership within an organisation, it involves a manager aiming to efficiently distribute work, decision-making and responsibility to subordinate workers in an organization. Delegation may result in creation of an accountable chain of authority where authority and responsibility moves down in an organisational structure. Inefficient delegation may lead to micromanagement.

There are a number of reasons someone may decide to delegate. These include: 
* To free themselves up to do other tasks in the pace of their own 
* To have the most qualified person making the decisions
* To seek another qualified person&#x27;s perspective on an issue
* To develop someone else&#x27;s ability to handle the additional assignments judiciously and successfully.

Delegation is widely accepted as an essential element of effective management. The ability to delegate is a critical skill in managing effectively. There are a number of factors that facilitate effective delegation by managers, including &quot;Recognising and respecting others’ capabilities; evaluating tasks and communicating how they fit in the big picture; matching people and assignments; providing support and encouragement; tolerating ambiguity and uncertainty; interpreting failure as a key to learning&quot;. With organisations being such complex and dynamic entities, the success of objectives relies heavily on how effectively tasks and responsibilities can be delegated.

== Process ==
According to Dr. Kanthi Wijesinghe, Senior Lecturer at the National Institute of Education, &quot;Delegation begins when the manager passes on some of their responsibilities to a subordinate. Responsibility is the work assigned to an individual.&quot; Delegation is strongly dependent on a supervisor&#x27;s ability to communicate, motivate, and understand individual preferences and differences. The process of delegation involves ensuring that a task and appropriate employee have been selected. The process of delegation requires &quot;preparation, initiation, implementation, and closure&quot;. While a manager can delegate authority for a task, the ultimate responsibility is not transferred. This means that delegation involves a process of sharing, which may include &quot;authority, power, influence, information, knowledge, or risk&quot;. This builds trust and morale between managers and subordinates. The internal and external environment of an organisation is often characterised by many interfering factors. Some of these include &quot;too much urgency, inexperience, and lack of trust&quot;. In order to minimise the effect of these factors, a clear delegation protocol should be developed and followed within an organisation.  

The process of delegation does not always follow a set structure, however, some aspects which are typically involved are:

# Allocation of duties: the delegator communicates to their subordinate the task which is to be performed. Resources are provided and a time limit is informed. 
# Delegation of authority: In order for the subordinate to perform the task, authority is required. The required authority is granted to the employee when the task is delegated. 
# Assignment of responsibilities: When authority is delegated, the subordinate is assigned with the responsibility of this task. When someone is given the rights to complete a task, they are assigned with the corresponding obligation to perform. Responsibility itself cannot be entirely delegated; a manager must still operate under equal responsibility to the delegated authority. 
# Creation of accountability: At the completion of the delegation process, it is essential that the manager creates accountability, meaning that subordinates must be answerable for the tasks which they have been authorised to carry out.

== Principles ==
There are a number of guidelines which are essential to understanding and implementing the process of delegation. The principles of delegation include:

=== Principle of result expected ===
The authority delegated to an individual subordinate needs to be adequate to ensure their ability to accomplish the results expected of the task. Prior to delegation, the manager needs to know the purpose of such delegation and the results which they expect from it. This means that goals, standards of performance and targets need to be clearly outlined to direct the actions of the subordinate to completion of the task.

=== Principle of parity of authority and responsibility ===
This principle outlines the concept that authority and responsibility co-exist and must go hand-in-hand. This means that the authority which is delegated to an employee must be consistent and equal to that of their responsibility. &quot;Responsibility without authority is meaningless&quot;. Each individual in an organisation requires the necessary authorities in order to effectively carry out assigned tasks; disparity should not exist between the responsibility imposed on and the authority granted to an employee in order to carry out a task.

=== Principle of absoluteness of responsibility ===
The principle of absoluteness of responsibility states that delegation of responsibility is not possible. Superiors are unable to relinquish, through the process of delegation, responsibility for the tasks and activities assigned to their subordinates, for they are the ones who delegated this authority and assigned the duty. Responsibility is absolute, with a manager remaining accountable for the actions of their subordinates.

=== Principle of unity of command ===
According to the principle of unity of command, employees should only have one supervisor, who they report to, are granted authority by and receive orders from. This employee should be solely accountable to their direct supervisor. This is associated with increased employee efficiency and less role conflict within an organisation.    

=== The scalar principle ===
The scalar principle asserts that there are clear and formal lines of hierarchal authority within an organisation. This hierarchy reflects the flow of authority and responsibility. It clearly outlines to managers and subordinates, who has the power to delegate authority and to whom they are answerable to.      

=== Principle of exception ===
This principle asserts that employees should be given complete freedom to fulfill their responsibilities within the purview of their authority. Managers should therefore refrain from interfering with the day-today work of their subordinates, even if minor mistakes are recognized. This level of control leads to more efficient results. In some exceptional cases, managers are able to interfere on matters deviating significantly from the norm; in this case the authority delegated to the subordinate may even be withdrawn.    

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Delegation is an essential and extremely useful management tool. When implemented effectively and successfully delegation results in many benefits to the organisation, manager and subordinate. However, if delegation in unsuccessful and not implemented optimally, the results can lead to serious disadvantages and have resultive effects.


Delegation is one of the best-known methods for efficiently managing time and leads to numerous benefits within an organisation. One of the most significant advantages of delegation is its use for employee motivation and development. The motivating factor associated with delegations comes from the increased confidence transferred from manager to subordinate. When a supervisor demonstrates their confidence it builds staff trust and self-confidence in the employees. There is a highly significant and positive relationship that exists between delegation and trust between an individual employee and management. Leaders are able to empower subordinates through the sharing of supervisor power. This leads to positive reinforcement of the supervisor&#x27;s role, builds morale and generates organisation trust. Delegation significantly increases effectiveness and efficiency in multiple ways. It eases the challenges relating to management’ workload, increasing responsiveness and growing and developing the capabilities of employees. Organisational resources are managed more efficiently, and subordinates are able to make decisions and perform tasks faster. Through delegation, lower level employees are able to embrace the opportunity to gain experience, build on capabilities and develop skills, which improves the organisation. Delegation is positively related to organisational commitment, task performance, innovative behavior and job satisfaction. At an organisational level, delegation can provide insight into current strengths and weaknesses, providing the opportunity for improvement and growth. It also increases the capacity of an organisation to respond quickly and effectively.

While the benefits are clear, there are a number of potential disadvantages and challenges to effective delegation. Ineffective use of delegation includes allowing no real influence or granting too much authority to someone who is unwilling or unable to make appropriate decisions. Some supervisors find it challenging to delegate tasks for the fear of becoming out of touch with the required skills or giving up something they truly enjoy. Delegation does involve a level of risk and uncertainty, which can be a powerful deterrent to delegation. When supervisors delegate a task, they remain responsible for whether or not it is carried out effectively and must consider the potential risks and rewards as a result of the delegation. Managers are often reluctant to delegate due to concerns that mistakes will be made, or that the job will not be completed to the standard which they believe they could achieve. Another concern relating to delegation is that top-level management can become wary that middle management will delegate for the benefit of their specific needs rather than those general to the organisation.   

== History ==

Delegation became a central feature of training in leadership in the developed by and taught at the in Germany from 1956 onwards.

<text>Greyhound was a grey Standardbred gelding by Guy Abbey out of Elizabeth by Peter the Great. Born in 1932, Greyhound was the outstanding trotting horse of his day and arguably the most outstanding in the history of the sport. He was nicknamed &quot;The Great Grey Ghost&quot; and &quot;Silver-skinned Flyer.&quot; In 1935, he won the Hambletonian race and in 1938 he lowered the record time for trotting the mile to 1:55¼. This record stood until 1969.

==Early life==
Greyhound was sold for $900 at auction due to his awkward appearance. As a two-year-old he won at venues including Good Time Park where he won the Good Time Stake, Springfield where he won the Review Futurity and Syracuse where he won the Horseman Futurity. At the end of the season he won the Lexington Trot at The Red Mile.

==1935 season==
In the Hambletonian, Greyhound sat back in the field until making a move at the 5/8 mile mark and swirling past the field to win in 2.02 1/4 in the first heat and 2.02 3/4 in the second. The first heat time was a race record. Reflective of the era, the nearly $19,000 he won at The Hambletonian was to become almost half his career earnings. After The Hambletonian Greyhound won the Review Futurity at Springfield with a 2.00 mile and the Championship Stallion Stake at Syracuse but due to injury he did not contest the Kentucky Futurity. He also won the Matron Stakes and Horseman Futurity. He won 18 of 20 starts as a three-year-old in 1935.

==1936 and 1937==
In 1936 Greyhound won at Springfield in 1.57 1/4. It was the fastest mile ever trotted in a race and the fastest trotting mile since Peter Manning in 1922. During the year he won the Empire State Trot at Syracuse and the Transylvania at Lexington as well as Grand Circuit wins at Old Orchard Beach and Springfield, Illinois. He also trotted a mile in 2.02 at Allentown which was a half mile track world record.

In 1937 Greyhound began his season by smashing the half mile track record with a 1.59 3/4 mile at Goshen. In a time trial at Indianapolis he reduced the world record for miles by almost 10 seconds to 3.02 1/2. At The Red Mile in Lexington Greyhound first equalled the world mark of 1.56 3/4 held by Peter Manning then a week later broke it trotting a mile in 1.56. His quarter mile fractions were 29 1/4, 57 1/2 and 1.27 1/2.

==1938 season==
In 1938 Greyhound raced more than he had the previous year winning the Trotting Derby at Goshen&#x27;s Good Time Park, the Matron Stakes and the Championship Stallion Stakes. He won all 10 heats across the 5 races he contested during the year. He trotted in 1.56 3/4 over a slow track at Indianapolis on August 30 before returning to Lexington to try to break his record. At Lexington he first equalled his 1.56 world record then a week later going to the quarter in 29 1/4, half in 58 1/2 and three quarters in 1.26 he was home in 1.55 1/4, last half in 56 3/4. Five days later Palin tried a different tactic by going quicker to the half in 28 1/2 and 56 3/4, but again getting to the three quarters in 1.26, he finished in 1.55 1/2.

==1939 and 1940==
In 1939 Greyhound did not start in a race as there was no horse prepared to race against him. Therefore, he was restricted to exhibitions against the clock. At Syracuse he was hitched together as a tandem with the mare Rosalind breaking the tandem record with a mile in 1:59. The next week at Indianapolis they did still better and nudged the trotting team mark down to 1:58 1/4. He took state records for Maine (1.57 1/2) at Old Orchard and Wisconsin (1.58) at Milwaukee. He also trotted 2 miles in 4.06 breaking the world record of Peter Manning.

It was announced in 1940 that Greyhound would be retired at the conclusion of the season&#x27;s racing. He won seven races and 14 of 15 heats and at Lexington Frances Dodge Johnson rode him under saddle in 2.01 3/4 for a mile, a world record for a trotter under saddle. Greyhound was then retired. He won 71 of 82 heats and 33 of 37 races, with three of the four race defeats coming as a two-year-old in 1934. He had trotted 25 two-minute miles and at one time held fourteen world records.

==Retirement==
He was retired in 1940 to Red Gate Farm in St. Charles, Illinois, and Baker&#x27;s Acres in Northbrook, Illinois, and in 1949, moved to Flanery Farm in Maple Park, Illinois where Col. Baker had an air-conditioned stall built for Greyhound with a sitting room for guests. During his twenty-five years of retirement, Greyhound was immensely popular among horse enthusiasts around the country. Greyhound was so popular that visitors came to see him until February 1965 when he died at the age of 33. His guest book was signed by visitors from 30 countries and all 50 states. He was buried at the Baker horse cemetery on Red Gate Farm alongside 1943 Hambletonian winner Volo Song and Col. Baker&#x27;s famous trotters Winnipeg and Labrador. In 2014, Greyhound&#x27;s stall where he had been shown to the public before his death, was transported to the Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame in Goshen, New York so that it could be reassembled and displayed in the museum.

Greyhound was honored as Trotter of the Century by the Hall of Fame after his death. He was again voted Trotter of the Century when in 1999 Hoof Beats, the official journal of the United States Trotting Association bestowed a similar honor upon him.

<doc id="218840" wikidata="Q667933" url="?curid=218840" title="Abuse of process">
<text>An abuse of process is the unjustified or unreasonable use of legal proceedings or process to further a cause of action by an applicant or plaintiff in an action. It is a claim made by the respondent or defendant that the other party is misusing or perverting regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action. In common law it is classified as a tort distinct from the intentional tort of malicious prosecution. It is a tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the courts. In the United States it may be described as a legal process being commenced to gain an unfair litigation advantage.

The elements of a valid cause of action for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings. Abuse of process can be distinguished from malicious prosecution, in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of malice, lack of probable cause in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious prosecution. Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of &quot;process&quot; considered to be capable of abuse.

==Distinct from malicious prosecution==

A cause of action for abuse of process is similar to the action for malicious prosecution in that both actions are based on and involve the improper use of the courts and legal systems. The primary difference between the two legal actions is that malicious prosecution concerns the malicious or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced. In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law. Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself, but in malicious prosecution, the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons. The three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for malicious prosecution. Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.

<doc id="218841" wikidata="Q216919" url="?curid=218841" title="Six Feet Under (TV series)">
<text>Six Feet Under is an American drama television series created and produced by Alan Ball for the premium television network HBO. The series premiered on June 3, 2001, and ended on August 21, 2005, after five seasons consisting of 63 episodes. The show depicts the lives of the Fisher family, who run a funeral home in Los Angeles, along with their friends and lovers.

The ensemble drama stars Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Freddy Rodriguez, Mathew St. Patrick, and Rachel Griffiths as the central characters. It was produced by Actual Size Films and The Greenblatt/Janollari Studio, and was shot on location in Los Angeles and in Hollywood studios.

&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and acting, and consistently drew high ratings for the HBO network. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. The show&#x27;s series finale has also been described as one of the greatest television series finales. The series won numerous awards, including nine Emmy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Peabody Award.

== Show synopsis ==

The show stars Peter Krause as Nate Fisher, whose funeral director father (Richard Jenkins) dies and bequeaths ownership of the Fisher &amp; Sons funeral home to Nate and his other son David (Michael C. Hall). The Fisher clan also includes widow Ruth Fisher (Frances Conroy) and daughter Claire Fisher (Lauren Ambrose). Other regulars include mortician Federico Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), Nate&#x27;s on-again/off-again girlfriend Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), and David&#x27;s long-term boyfriend Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick).

On one level, the show is a conventional family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, sex, masculine homosexuality, dysfunction, infidelity, personal growth, and religion. At the same time, it is distinguished by its focus on the topic of death, which it explores on personal, religious, and philosophical levels. Most episodes begin with a death, the cause of which ranges from heart attack to murder to accidental death or sudden infant death syndrome. That death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes in a way that is illuminated by the death and its aftermath.

A recurring plot device consists of a character having an imaginary conversation with the deceased; for example, Nate, David, and Federico sometimes &quot;converse&quot; with the deceased at the beginning of the episode, while the corpse is being embalmed, or during funeral planning or the funeral itself. Sometimes, the characters converse with other deceased characters, most notably Nathaniel Fisher Sr. The show&#x27;s creator Alan Ball said this represents the living characters&#x27; internal dialogues expressed in the form of external conversations.

== Production ==

=== Concept ===
Although overall plots and characters were created by Alan Ball, reports conflict on how the series was conceived. In one instance, Ball stated that he came up with the premise of the show after the deaths of his sister and father. However, in an interview on the series&#x27; DVD collection, he intimated that HBO entertainment president Carolyn Strauss had proposed the idea to him. In a copyright infringement lawsuit, screenwriter Gwen O&#x27;Donnell asserted that she was the original source of the idea that later passed through Strauss to Ball; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, proceeding on the assumption that this assertion was true, rejected her claim.

Airing on a premium cable network allowed the series to explore darker themes than would have been possible on other networks. Ball stated in an interview:

=== Major themes ===
The show focuses on human mortality, the symbiotic nature of life and death feeding off each other, the death industry, and the lives of those who deal with it on a daily basis. When discussing the concept of the show, Ball elaborated on the foremost questions the show&#x27;s pilot targeted:

&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; introduces the Fisher family as the basis on which to explore these questions. Throughout its five-season, 63-episode run, major characters experience crises that are in direct relation to their environment and the grief they have experienced. Ball again relates these experiences, as well as the choice of the series&#x27; title, to the persistent subtext of the program:

Cultural critic Sally Munt commented: &quot;one might risk saying [the show] has an uncanny, or queer rendition of class positions and relations&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine opined that the show &quot;carefully avoided moralism&quot; but there were times where it &quot;felt like a message&quot; that &quot;death has a terrible timing&quot; and it could also be a &quot;karmic gift&quot; for some. Ball refuted this claim by asserting that there was no message in the story but only a recognition that death comes in the middle of &quot;messy things&quot; and does not wait for people to sort out their lives.

=== Setting ===
Exteriors for the Fisher home were shot at 2302 West 25th Street and the intersection of Arlington Avenue, in the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles.

=== Crew ===
Creator Alan Ball also served as executive producer and showrunner for the entire series run. Robert Greenblatt and David Janollari executive produced the series, as the Greenblatt Janollari Studio was one of the production companies. The other producers were Lori Jo Nemhauser and Robert Del Valle.

The writing staff included Ball, who wrote nine episodes over the series run, including the pilot episode and the series finale. Writers who were on staff for the entire series run included Rick Cleveland, who wrote eight episodes and became an executive producer in the fifth season; Kate Robin, who wrote eight episodes and became a supervising producer in the fifth season; and Bruce Eric Kaplan, who wrote seven episodes and became an executive producer in the fourth season. Christian Williams was just on staff for the first season, writing two episodes. Both Laurence Andries and Christian Taylor wrote three episodes each during their run on the series for the first two seasons, and they also served as producers. Scott Buck and Joey Soloway joined in the second season, staying on staff for the rest of the series, and each wrote seven episodes. Buck became a co-executive producer in the fourth season, and Soloway became a co-executive producer in the fifth season. The last set of writers to join the staff were Craig Wright and Nancy Oliver in the third season. Wright wrote six episodes and became a producer in the fifth season and Oliver wrote five episodes and became a co-producer in the fifth season.

Ball also directed the most episodes, directing the pilot and each of the season finales. Dan Attias also directed six episodes, from seasons two to five. Kathy Bates (who also played Bettina on the series), Michael Cuesta, Rodrigo García, and Jeremy Podeswa each directed five episodes. Michael Engler, Daniel Minahan, and Alan Poul (who also served as an executive producer for the series) each directed four episodes. Miguel Arteta directed three episodes and Nicole Holofcener directed two episodes. Single-episode directors included Peter Care, Alan Caso, Lisa Cholodenko, Allen Coulter, Adam Davidson, Mary Harron, Joshua Marston, Jim McBride, Karen Moncrieff, John Patterson, Matt Shakman, Alan Taylor, Rose Troche, and Peter Webber.

=== Music ===
The series&#x27; main theme, written by composer Thomas Newman, won a 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music and two Grammy Awards in 2003 for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Instrumental Arrangement.

The production sound from seasons three through five was mixed by Bo Harwood, and was nominated in 2004 for a Cinema Audio Society Award.

Seasons two through five featured a promotional teaser trailer prior to the premiere of that season. The songs featured in each season&#x27;s trailer were &quot;Heaven&quot; by Lamb for season two; &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; by Coldplay for season three; &quot;Feeling Good&quot; by Nina Simone for season four; and &quot;Breathe Me&quot; by Sia for season five, which is also used for montage in the series finale. All these songs are included in either of two soundtracks for the show.

The episode recaps for the first two seasons feature the song &quot;Nothing Lies Still Long&quot; by Pell Mell. The episode previews for the first and fifth seasons feature the &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; title theme, while the other seasons feature the Rae &amp; Christian remix version of the title theme.

Music supervision for the entire run of the series was provided by Gary Calamar and Thomas Golubic, who were also credited as producers for the two soundtrack albums.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and acting. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time, included on best-of lists by &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot;. The show&#x27;s finale has also been described as one of the greatest television series finales. The Writers Guild of America ranked it #18 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; received critical acclaim for most of its run, with the exception of the fourth season, which received more mixed reviews. The first season holds a rating of 74 out of 100 at Metacritic based on 23 reviews. Early reviews of the series were positive, prior to the screening of the pilot episode; Steve Oxman of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; is a smart, brooding, fanciful character-driven ensemble piece about a family in the funeral biz.&quot; Following the series premiere, Barry Garron of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented that the series&#x27; &quot;examination of family life through the prism of a mortuary business, combines sardonic humor with poignant drama and comes up with a unique tone and style, in itself quite an accomplishment for any TV series. It is fearless in its approach to storytelling and, far more often than not, succeeds in the risks it takes&quot; and &quot;there is much to admire about this series, including top-notch performances, artful direction and creative storytelling that employs various techniques, including dream sequences and parody commercials. Best of all, though, is Ball&#x27;s introspection and the insight he provides about society, the funeral industry, and family relationships.&quot;

Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; certainly got enthusiastic reviews, almost universally glowing notices about the rich characterizations and quirky humor shaped by the show&#x27;s celebrated creator, Alan Ball, the Academy Award-winning writer of the film &quot;American Beauty&quot;.&quot; In an early response from HBO executive Chris Albrecht, he announced in regards to the viewers, that they are &quot;totally thrilled with the series.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a 90% approval rating with an average score of 8/10 based on 40 reviews, with a critical consensus of, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot;″s unusual setting provides a perfect backdrop for the macabre meditations on mortality made by its brilliant, brooding cast.&quot; The second season has a 79% approval rating with an average score of 9.3/10 based on 14 reviews, with a critical consensus of, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot;″s deliberately paced second season is less endearing than the first, but the engaging ensemble remain reason enough to watch.&quot; The third season has a 90% approval rating with an average score of 7.6/10 based on 20 reviews, with a critical consensus of, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot;″s third season dials down the comedy in favor of creepier narratives – a challenge its cast is more than up to.&quot; The fourth season has a 50% approval rating with an average score of 5.6/10 based on 10 reviews, with a critical consensus of, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; overreaches in its fourth season, with twists and story arcs that feel more contrived than compelling, though its willingness to venture boldly into the dark also proves occasionally exhilarating.&quot; The fifth season has a 97% approval rating with an average score of 8.9/10 based on 35 reviews, with a critical consensus of, &quot;&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; offers a fitting end for the Fishers by concluding the way it began: an unexpectedly beautiful rumination on life, death and grief.&quot;

The series finale is considered one of the greatest endings in television history. In a 2015 interview with Alan Ball, Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, and Lauren Ambrose for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, to mark ten years since the show&#x27;s conclusion, they described it as the &quot;finale that would not die&quot;. Megan Vick of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said, &quot;The idea of flashing forward to depict how each member of the Fishers and their loved ones would pass on seemed revolutionary in 2005, but Ball – who created the series and would write and direct its final episode – uses another word for it – inevitable.&quot;

<doc id="218842" wikidata="Q4273016" url="?curid=218842" title="Malicious prosecution">
<text>Malicious prosecution is a common law intentional tort. Like the tort of abuse of process, its elements include (1) intentionally (and maliciously) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action (civil or criminal) that is (2) brought without probable cause and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution. In some jurisdictions, the term &quot;malicious prosecution&quot; denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term &quot;malicious use of process&quot; denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.

Criminal prosecuting attorneys and judges are protected from tort liability for malicious prosecution by doctrines of prosecutorial immunity and judicial immunity. Moreover, the mere filing of a complaint cannot constitute an abuse of process. The parties who have abused or misused the process have gone beyond merely filing a lawsuit. The taking of an appeal, even a frivolous one, is not enough to constitute an abuse of process. The mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit, even for an improper purpose, is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.

Declining to expand the tort of malicious prosecution, a unanimous California Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker&quot;, 47 Cal. 3d 863, 873 (1989) observed: &quot;While the filing of frivolous lawsuits is certainly improper and cannot in any way be condoned, in our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself, rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded.&quot;

==Origins==
The tort originates in the (now defunct) legal maxim that &quot;the King pays no costs&quot;; that is, the Crown could not be forced to pay the legal costs of a person it prosecuted, even if that person was found innocent. As &quot;The London Magazine&quot; stated in 1766: &quot;if a groundless and vexatious prosecution be commenced in the King&#x27;s name, his ministers who commenced, or advised commencing that prosecution, ought at least to be obliged to pay the costs which an innocent subject has thereby been put to&quot;.

==U.S. use of English Rule==

Sixteen U.S. states require another element of malicious prosecution. This element, commonly called the English Rule, states that, in addition to fulfilling all other malicious prosecution elements, one must also prove injury other than the normal downside of being sued. This rule is limited to equitable damages, such as loss of profit, and excludes damages that cannot be measured by the law (&quot;e.g.&quot;, damage to reputation).

==Canadian law==
Canadian jurisprudence has changed in that if any individual takes legal action that meets the above criteria, they may be sued. Legal action may be taken against the police or Crown attorneys or the Attorney General, as they are no longer exempt from suit.

The tort of malicious prosecution was reviewed in 2009 by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Miazga v. Kvello Estate&quot;, and specifically how it applied to public prosecutors in Canada. The court outlined the four required elements for the tort of malicious prosecution: (i) The prosecution must be initiated by the defendant; (ii) The prosecution must be terminated in the plaintiff&#x27;s favour. (iii) There was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds to commence or continue the prosecution; and (iv) The defendant was motivated to commence or to continue the prosecution due to malice.

In 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the contents of plea bargaining negotiations held in the context of criminal cases could be admitted as evidence in the context of a civil suit for malicious prosecution, despite the general evidentiary rule prohibiting adducing settlement discussions into proof at trial. More specifically, the Court held that introducing into evidence the contents of such negotiations was possible when it tended to demonstrate that the prosecution initiated or maintained criminal charges on the basis of improper motives.

==Limitations==
Notably, the tort of malicious prosecution only protects the right of defendants to be free of frivolous lawsuits brought by malicious plaintiffs. For a variety of reasons grounded in public policy, courts have consistently refused to authorize the converse — a tort of malicious defense which would protect the right of plaintiffs to be free of frivolous defenses raised by defendants.

<text>George Gard &quot;Buddy&quot; DeSylva (January 27, 1895 – July 11, 1950) was an American songwriter, film producer and record executive. He wrote or co-wrote many popular songs, and along with Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs, he co-founded Capitol Records.

==Biography==
DeSylva was born in New York City, but grew up in California, and attended the University of Southern California, where he joined the Theta Xi fraternity.

His Portuguese-born father, Aloysius J. De Sylva, was better known to American audiences as actor Hal De Forrest. His father was also a lawyer as well as an actor. His mother, Georgetta Miles Gard, was the daughter of Los Angeles police chief George E. Gard.

DeSylva&#x27;s first successful songs were those used by Al Jolson on Broadway in the 1918 production of &quot;Sinbad&quot;, which included &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Does&quot;. Soon thereafter, he met Jolson and in 1918 the pair went to New York and DeSylva began working as a songwriter in Tin Pan Alley.

In the early 1920s, DeSylva frequently worked with composer George Gershwin. Together, they created the experimental one-act jazz opera &quot;Blue Monday&quot; set in Harlem, which is widely regarded as a forerunner to &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; ten years later.

In April 1924, DeSylva married Marie Wallace, a Ziegfeld Follies dancer.

In 1925, DeSylva became one third of the songwriting team with lyricist Lew Brown and composer Ray Henderson, one of the top Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the era. The team was responsible for the song &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1927) which was popularized by Lou Gold&#x27;s orchestra. The writing and publishing partnership continued until 1930, producing a string of hits and the perennial Broadway favorite &quot;Good News&quot;.

DeSylva joined ASCAP in 1920 and served on the ASCAP board of directors between 1922 and 1930. He became a producer of stage and screen musicals. DeSylva relocated to Hollywood and was contracted to Fox Studios.

During this tenure, he produced movies such as &quot;The Little Colonel&quot;, &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot;, &quot;Captain January&quot;, &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; and &quot;Stowaway&quot;. In 1941, he became the Executive Producer at Paramount Pictures, a position he would hold until 1944. At Paramount, he was also an uncredited executive producer for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot; and &quot;The Glass Key&quot;. Betty Hutton always credited DeSylva for bringing her to Hollywood and launching her film career.

The Paramount all-star extravaganza &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot;, which takes place at the Paramount film studio in Hollywood, features a fictional movie executive named &quot;B.G. DeSoto&quot; (played by Walter Abel) who is a parody of DeSylva.

<text>Gamla stan (, &quot;The Old Town&quot;), until 1980 officially Staden mellan broarna (&quot;The Town between the Bridges&quot;), is the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. Gamla stan consists primarily of the island Stadsholmen. Officially, but not colloquially, Gamla stan includes the surrounding islets Riddarholmen, Helgeandsholmen and Strömsborg. It has a population of approximately 3,000.

Gamla Stan has played a prominent role in the history of Swedish architecture, with many of Sweden&#x27;s most renowned architects shaping the area; these include figures such as Nicodemus Tessin and Carl Hårleman, who worked on the Stockholm Palace, still located in the area.

Other notable buildings in the old town include Tessin&#x27;s own palace, the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building, Bonde Palace (seat of the Swedish Supreme Court) and the important House of Nobility; the last of these buildings hosted the parliament for many years.

==Overview==


The town dates back to the 13th century, and consists of medieval alleyways, cobbled streets, and archaic architecture. North German architecture has had a strong influence in the Old Town&#x27;s construction.
Stortorget is the name of the scenic &quot;large square&quot; in the centre of Gamla Stan, which is surrounded by old merchants&#x27; houses including the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building. The square was the site of the Stockholm Bloodbath, where Swedish noblemen were massacred by the Danish King Christian II in November, 1520. The following revolt and civil war led to the dissolution of the Kalmar Union and the subsequent election of King Gustav I.

As well as being home to the Stockholm Cathedral, the Nobel Museum, and the Riddarholm church, Gamla stan also boasts &quot;Kungliga slottet&quot;, Sweden&#x27;s baroque Royal Palace, built in the 18th century after the previous palace Tre Kronor burned down. The House of Nobility (&quot;Riddarhuset&quot;) is on the north-western corner of Gamla stan.

The restaurant Den gyldene freden is located on Österlånggatan. It has been in business, continuously, since 1722 and according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; is the longest operated restaurant with an unchanged environment and is one of the oldest restaurants in the world. It is now owned by the Swedish Nobel Academy that have their &quot;Thursday luncheons&quot; there every week. A statue of St. George and the Dragon (sculpted by Bernt Notke) can be found in the Stockholm Cathedral, while Riddarholmskyrkan is the royal burial church. Bollhustäppan, a small courtyard at Slottsbacken behind the &quot;Finnish Church&quot;, just south of the main approach to the Royal Palace, is home to one of the smallest statues in Sweden, a little boy in wrought iron. The plaque just below the statue says its name &quot;Järnpojken&quot; (&quot;The Iron Boy&quot;). It was created by Liss Eriksson in 1967.

From the mid-19th century to the early-mid 20th century Gamla stan was considered a slum, many of its historical buildings left in disrepair, and just after World War II, several blocks together five alleys were demolished for the enlargement of the Riksdag (see Brantingtorget). From the 1970s and 80s, however, it has become a tourist attraction as the charm of its medieval, Renaissance architecture and later additions have been valued by later generations.

While the archaeology of the 370 properties in Gamla stan remains poorly documented, recent inventories done by volunteers have shown many buildings previously dated to the 17th and 18th centuries, can be up to 300 years older.

==History==
===Origins of the names &quot;Stockholm&quot; and &quot;Gamla Stan&quot;===
The name &quot;Stockholm&quot; originally referred to Gamla Stan only, but as the city has expanded, the name now also refers to several suburban areas that are included in the metro region. &quot;Stockholm&quot; means &quot;log island&quot; in Swedish. The previous capital of Sweden was located in Sigtuna. A thousand years ago Sigtuna had problems with armed gangs attacking the city. The situation became untenable and there was a need to find a new location for the capital. According to legend, the leaders in Sigtuna took a log, hollowed it out, filled it with gold, and set it afloat. Several days later it landed at the island where Gamla Stan is located today. This is where they decided to found the new capital of Sweden. The island of Stockholm had the advantage that it was an island, easy to defend from armed gangs that could be thought to want to attack the city. It also had the advantage that it was situated just at the inlet of Lake Mälaren, which was very important in trade to and from the Baltic. There is a sculpture symbolizing the old log at Stadshuset (City Hall).

Until the mid-19th century Gamla Stan was referred to as &quot;själva staden&quot; (&quot;the city itself&quot;), since the areas surrounding it were still mostly rural in character. They were referred to as &quot;malmarna&quot; (&quot;the ridges&quot;). However, from the mid-19th century onwards it started to be called &quot;staden mellan broarna&quot; (&quot;the city between the bridges&quot;) or &quot;staden inom broarna&quot; (&quot;the city within the bridges&quot;), a name that remained official until 1980, and from 1934 also included the islets Helgeandsholmen and Strömsborg. The name &quot;Gamla stan&quot; probably dates back to the early 20th century, when it was used colloquially. &quot;Gamla&quot; means &quot;(the) old.&quot; The word &quot;&quot; is simply a contraction of the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;sta&#x27;n&quot;), meaning &quot;the town.&quot; In 1957 a station of the Stockholm metro was opened here with the name &quot;Gamla stan&quot;. Even though the official name was changed to Gamla stan in 1980, modern Stockholm is occasionally called &quot;The city between the bridges&quot;.

===Prehistory===

Stockholm derives its mythological origin from a dwelling place called &quot;Agnefit&quot;. As the second element &quot;fit&quot; means &#x27;moist meadow&#x27;, this place was supposedly located on the western shore of today&#x27;s Stadsholmen (arguably the only possible location for a meadow at the time). The first element of this name is, explains the historian Snorri Sturluson (1178–1241), derived from King Agne, a presumably mythological king who, in a dim and distant past (around 400 A.D. according to some historians), encamped here after having successfully raided Finland. His intentions were to marry &quot;Skjalf&quot;, the daughter of the defeated Finnish chieftain. The young woman, however, tricked him to arrange a celebration including prominent guests which eventually turned into a boozing party, and, while Agne slept in a drunken stupor, Skjalf had him hanged in his gold necklace before escaping.
While the reliability of this story remains disputed, dendrochronological examinations of logs found on Helgeandsholmen just north of Stadsholmen in 1978–1980, concluded these trees were cut down during the period 970–1020, most of them from the later part of that period, and these logs presumably gave the entire city its present name, &quot;Stock-holm&quot;, &quot;Log-Islet&quot;.

===Middle Ages and Vasa era===
The original wall-enclosed city only encompassed the central elevated area of the present old town located between the two long streets — Västerlånggatan and Österlånggatan (i.e. &quot;Western/Eastern Long Street&quot;) — which passed between the shorelines of the era and the eastern and western city walls. The eastern wall passed between two defensive towers; the northern being that of what was to become the castle Three Crowns, destroyed by fire in 1697, and the southern, of which no archaeological traces have been found, is known to have been given to the Blackfriars by King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1377) in 1336 and therefore was arguably located at the location for the monastery, in the southern end of Prästgatan, north of the square Järntorget. The steep precipices forming the outskirts of the original city is still discernible in the pronounced difference of levels in today&#x27;s urban landscape: The two long streets which ran just outside the city walls — Västerlånggatan and Prästgatan (some 5 metres) — and the streets running parallel to them, just inside the city walls — Österlånggatan and Bollhusgränd-Baggensgatan (up to 10 metres).

The center of the medieval city was probably just a fairground south of the town hall and the only church in the village. The market place, originally smaller than the present and enlarged following a fire in the early 15th century, was eventually surrounded by permanent buildings and evolved into the present public square Stortorget (&quot;The Large Square&quot;), still located south of the so-called Stock Exchange and the Cathedral. While Stockholm is likely to have expanded quickly, it remains much debated if the expansion was planned in accordance to the model of southern prototypes (e.g. such as Lübeck) and, as historical sources traditionally have rendered it, governed directly by Birger Jarl (1210–1266) and Magnus Ladulås (1240–1290), or, as some historian have argued, a somewhat desultory if not entirely unmethodical process. Nevertheless, the medieval thoroughfares led from the large square in all four cardinal directions: Köpmangatan (&quot;Merchant&#x27;s Street&quot;) led east down to a second square by the water, &quot;Fisketorget&quot; (&quot;Fishery Square&quot;). Svartmangatan (&quot;Black Man&#x27;s Street&quot;, named after the Blackfriars monastery) and Skomakargatan (&quot;Shoemaker&#x27;s Street&quot;) led south to the financial centre of the city. Located where is today Järntorget (&quot;The Iron Square&quot;), this marketplace was at the time not much more than two landing stages separated by an open space on the southern corner of the island. On either side of this marketplace, considerably larger than the present square, was on its eastern side &quot;Koggabron&quot; (named after, cogs, a type of medieval merchant vessel) and today superseded by Skeppsbron, and on its western side was &quot;Kornhamn&quot; (&quot;Corn Harbour&quot;) receiving the ships from Lake Mälaren, located near today&#x27;s Kornhamnstorg. Trångsund (&quot;Narrow Strait&quot;), at the time much narrower than today, was leading north past the cathedral.

As the city gates were patently the weakest point in all medieval fortifications, the fewer the better was the obvious rule. In medieval Stockholm, presumably three or four narrow gates opened the wall: Through the eastern wall a single gate allowed Köpmangatan to pass down to the shore, while the others, all leading to Västerlånggatan, were located where today are Storkyrkobrinken (&quot;Slope of the Great Church&quot;), Kåkbrinken (&quot;Slope of the [Ramshackle] House&quot;), and Tyska Brinken (&quot;German Slope&quot;). Surrounding the Royal Palace was an open area called &quot;Sanden&quot; (&quot;The Sand&quot;), intentionally kept free for defensive reasons and including the present location of Slottsbacken (&quot;Palace Slope&quot;), south of the palace, and Högvaktsterrassen (&quot;Terrace of the Main Guard&quot;), west of it. Within the city, the artery roads were stipulated to be eight ell wide (&quot;aln&quot;, e.g. barely five meters) to allow horse-drawn vehicles to pass, while no rules restricted the width of cross-streets. As the city started to get overcrowded in the 14th century, new buildings were built on the shores outside the city wall, and gradually land fillings between the bridges along the shores gave room for sheds and storehouses forming the elongated blocks separated by narrow alleys which are today characteristic for the old town. Within the old city center, larger blocks were partitioned into smaller ones, which resulted in several narrow streets such as Trädgårdsgatan (&quot;Garden Street&quot;) and Kindstugatan (&quot;Box on the Ear Street&quot;, historical, corrupted).

In average, the medieval streets are found some three meters below the present streets. Archaeological excavations have shown the oldest streets were covered with wood, the oldest being the three layers of wooden pavings found under the northern end of Västerlånggatan from around 1250–1300. During the later part of the 14th century, the streets started to get paved in stone, and as the archaeological deposits above them are composed of thin layers of filth containing few findings, street cleansing was apparently improved during this era. Waste and garbage was often simply poured out into the alleys, occasionally through apertures used exclusively for the purpose. Though a few assumed medieval subterranean wooden tubes and vaulted underground chambers have been found, relatively few traces remain in Stockholm of the sort of sophisticated system of sewers found in for example Visby and Bergen, so most likely the sloping alleys simply had to do the job. Many public notices were in vain devoted to restrain the habit of littering the surrounding waters and restricting the number of animals kept within the city walls, and not until the end of the Middle Ages were gutters ordered to be cleaned twice a week and the placement of bogs forbidden next to neighbours and thoroughfares. Latrines were gathered on central locations known as &quot;flugmöten&quot; (&quot;fly meetings&quot;) where the number of insects darkened the sky well into the 19th century.

The present alleys only give a vague glimpse of the appearance of the medieval city where the gables of the building were facing the streets and contained window bays for offering goods of sale; where filth, the bumpy paving and hand-drawn vehicles made walking circumstantial; and where odours and scents from dung, food, fishes, leather, furnaces, and seasonal spices mingled. During nights (and certainly during the long winters) the city was completely dark, save for exceptional fire watchers and nocturnal ramblers who used torches to find their bearing. Neither were there any street signs guiding foreigners as no streets were officially named, instead referred to as &quot;the thoroughfare running from the outer southern gate and up to the cross and the chapel&quot; or constantly renamed after the most prominent person settled in an exposed part of the alley. Indeed, historical records contain many examples of obscure references to locations in the city, close to impossible to pin down as some streets have been renamed dozens of times, often carrying the same or a similar name as other streets before physically ceasing to exist.

===17th century===
In Swedish history, the first half of the 17th century was a period of awakening which preceded the so-called Swedish Empire. Following the death of Gustavus II Adolphus (1594–1632) the nation was determined never having to repeat the embarrassment experienced when Stockholm, still medieval in character, caused hesitation on whether to invite foreign statesmen for fear the lamentable appearance might undermine the nation&#x27;s authority.

A map of Stadsholmen dated 1626 presents a proposal for two streets roughly equivalent to the southern stretches of today&#x27;s Tyska Brinken and Stora Nygatan. Within short, however, it was realized that with the proposal the northern end of the boulevard-like street would be pointing at a non-notable medieval façade, and it was thus decided the street had to be lengthened all the way to the northern shore of the island — a project that would take decades to complete. The two straight streets Stora Nygatan and Lilla Nygatan (&quot;Large/Small New Street&quot;) — both children of this second regulation — took a time long to realize and were not completed until the funeral of King Charles X in 1660. Soon this ambitious project led to a more representative framework. The informal northern end of Stora Nygatan was thus connected to the newly created square Mynttorget by Myntgatan, and the slope Storkyrkobrinken was widened.

On the eastern side of the island, the obsolete medieval wall was gradually demolished, and before the end of the century completely replaced by a row of private palaces, the so-called &quot;Skeppsbroraden&quot;, the &quot;Row of Skeppsbron&quot;. To what extent these two projects were planned and initiated by the King Gustavus II Adolphus himself remains undocumented, but undoubtedly he must have played an important role. These projects were, nevertheless, accompanied by similar ambitions for Riddarholmen, where eventually several new palaces would be built, and for the ridges surrounding the city, where Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna had the medieval slum replaced by a more representative Baroque city.

==In popular culture==
Gamla Stan is referenced in the Yorushika song, &quot;August, A Certain Place, Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

The street of Tyska Skolgränd is the cover picture for Yorushika&#x27;s album &quot;That&#x27;s Why I Gave Up on Music&quot;

<text>A civil code is a codification of private law relating to property, family, and obligations.

A jurisdiction that has a civil code generally also has a code of civil procedure. In some jurisdictions with a civil code, a number of the core areas of private law that would otherwise typically be codified in a civil code may instead be codified in a commercial code.

==History==
The history of codification dates back to ancient Babylon. The earliest surviving civil code is the Code of Ur-Nammu, written around 2100–2050 BC. The Corpus Juris Civilis, a codification of Roman law produced between 529 and 534 AD by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, forms the basis of civil law legal systems that would rule over Continental Europe.

Other codified laws used since ancient times include various texts used in religious law, such as the Law of Manu in Hindu law, Islamic Sharia law, the Mishnah in Jewish Halakha law, and the Canons of the Apostles in Christian Canon law.

===European codes and influences on other continents===
The idea of codification re-emerged during the Age of Enlightenment, when it was believed that all spheres of life could be dealt with in a conclusive system based on human rationality, following from the experience of the early codifications of Roman Law during the Roman Empire.

The first attempts at modern codification were made in the second half of the 18th century in Germany, when the states of Austria, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony began to codify their laws. The first statute that used this denomination was the &quot;Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis&quot; of 1756 in Bavaria, still using the Latin language. It was followed in 1792 by a legal compilation that included civil, penal, and constitutional law, the &quot;Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preussischen Staaten&quot; (General National Law for the Prussian States) promulgated by King Frederick II the Great. In Austria, the first step towards fully-fledged codification were the yet incomplete Codex Theresianus (compiled between 1753 and 1766), the Josephinian Code (1787) and the complete West Galician Code (enacted as a test in Galicia in 1797). The final Austrian Civil Code (called &quot;Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;, ABGB) was only completed in 1811 after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire under the influence of the Napoleonic Wars. One of the first countries to follow up through legal transplants in codification was Serbia, the Serbian Civil Code (1844).

Meanwhile, the French Napoleonic code (&quot;Code Civil&quot;) was enacted in 1804 after only a few years of preparation, but it was a child of the French Revolution, which is strongly reflected by its content. The French code was the most influential one because it was introduced in many countries standing under French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. In particular, countries such as Italy, the Benelux countries, Spain, Portugal (with the Civil Code of 1867, later replaced by the Civil Code of 1966, which is strongly influenced by the German BGB), the Latin American countries, the province of Quebec in Canada, and all other former French colonies which base their civil law systems to a strong extent on the Napoleonic Code. It is a misconception that the state of Louisiana in the United States based their civil code on the Napoleonic code. Rather, the drafters of the code were instructed to write a civil code based on the current laws, and the laws that were in effect at the time were Spanish laws based on Las Siete Partidas.

The late 19th century and the beginning 20th century saw the emergence of the School of Pandectism, whose work peaked in the German Civil Code (BGB), which was enacted in 1900 in the course of Germany&#x27;s national unification project, and in the Swiss Civil Code (&quot;Zivilgesetzbuch&quot;) of 1907. Those two codes had been most advanced in their systematic structure and classification from fundamental and general principles to specific areas of law (e.g. contract law, labour law, inheritance law). While the French Civil Code was structured in a &quot;casuistic&quot; approach attempting to regulate every possible case, the German BGB and the later Swiss ZGB applied a more abstract and systematic approach. Therefore, the BGB had a great deal of influence on later codification projects in countries as diverse as Japan, Greece, Turkey, Portugal (1966 Civil Code) and Macau (1999 Civil Code).

Since 2002 with the First law of the Civil Code of Catalonia, Parliament of Catalonia&#x27;s several laws have approved the successive books of the Civil Code of Catalonia. This has replaced most of the Compilation of the Civil Law of Catalonia, several special laws and two partial codes. Only the Sixth book, relating to obligations and contracts, has to be approved.

In Europe, apart from the common law countries of the United Kingdom and Ireland, only Scandinavia remained untouched by the codification movement. The particular tradition of the civil code originally enacted in a country is often thought to have a lasting influence on the methodology employed in legal interpretation. Scholars of comparative law and economists promoting the legal origins theory of (financial) development usually subdivide the countries of the civil law tradition as belonging either to the French, Scandinavian or German group (the latter including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Ukraine).
===Civil codes in the Americas===
The first civil code promulgated in Canada was that of New Brunswick of 1804, inspired by the 1800 project of the French civil code, known as the &quot;Projet de l&#x27;an VIII&quot; (project of the 8th year); nevertheless, in 1808 a &quot;Digeste de la loi civile&quot; was sanctioned.

In the United States, codification appears to be widespread at a first glance, but U.S. legal codes are actually collections of common law rules and a variety of &quot;ad hoc&quot; statutes; that is, they do not aspire to complete logical coherence. For example, the California Civil Code largely codifies common law doctrine and is very different in form and content from all other civil codes. Another unique example is the Louisiana Civil Code, based on Spanish law Las Siete Partidas, but incorrectly credited to be based on French Law.

In 1825, Haiti promulgated a &quot;Code Civil&quot;, that was simply a copy of the Napoleonic one; while Louisiana abolished its &quot;Digeste&quot;, replacing it with the &quot;Code Civil de l&#x27;État de la Louisiane&quot; the same year.

The Mexican state of Oaxaca promulgated the first Latin American civil code in 1827, copying the French civil code.

Later on, in 1830, the civil code of Bolivia, a summarized copy of the French one, was promulgated by Andrés de Santa Cruz. The latest, with some changes, was adopted by Costa Rica in 1841.

The Dominican Republic, in 1845, put into force the original Napoleonic code, in French language (a translation in Spanish was published in 1884).

In 1852, Peru promulgated its own civil code (based on a project of 1847), which was not a simple copy or imitation of the French one, but presented a more original text based on the Castillan law (of Roman origin) that was previously in force on the Peruvian territory.

Chile promulgated its civil code in 1855, an original work in confront with the French code both for the scheme and for the contents (similar to the Castillan law in force in that territory) that was written by Andrés Bello (begun in 1833). This code was integrally adopted by Ecuador in 1858; El Salvador in 1859; Venezuela in 1862 (only during that year); Nicaragua in 1867; Honduras in 1880 (until 1899, and again since 1906); Colombia in 1887; and Panama (after its separation from Colombia in 1903).

In 1865, the Code Civil du Bas-Canada (or Civil Code of Lower Canada) was promulgated in Lower Canada (later the Canadian province of Quebec). It was replaced in 1991 by a new Civil Code of Quebec, which came into effect in 1994.

Uruguay promulgated its code in 1868, and Argentina in 1869 (work by Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield). Paraguay adopted its code in 1987, and in 1877 Guatemala adopted the Peruvian code of 1852.

Nicaragua in 1904 replaced its civil code of 1867 by adopting the Argentine code. In 1916 Brazil enacted its civil code (project of Clovis Bevilacqua, after rejecting the project by Teixeira de Freitas that was translated by the Argentines to prepare their project), that entered into effect in 1917 (in 2002, the Brazilian Civil Code was replaced by a new text). Brazilian Civil Code of 1916 was considered, by many, as the last code of the 19th century despite being adopted in the 20th century. The reason behind that is that the Brazilian Code of 1916 was the last of the important codes from the era of codifications in the world that had strong liberal influences, and all other codes enacted thereafter were deeply influenced by the social ideals that emerged after World War I and the Soviet Socialist Revolution.

Panama in 1916 decided to adopt the Argentine code, replacing its code of 1903.

Cuba had the old Civil Code of Spain until the year 1987 when the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power approved the Cuban Civil Code, Law 59.

===Civil codes in Asia===
The Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was introduced in the Portuguese overseas territories of Asia (Portuguese India, Macau and Portuguese Timor) from 1870, with local modifications being latter introduced. It continued to be in effect in the former Portuguese India even after the end of the Portuguese rule in 1961. It is still in force in the present Indian territories of Goa (locally referred as the Goa civil code), Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As Macau and Portuguese Timor were still under Portuguese rule when the Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was replaced by that of 1966, this later was adopted by these territories. In East Timor (ex-Portuguese Timor), the Portuguese Code was replaced by the Indonesian Code when Indonesia occupied that territory in 1975. Macau adopted its own Civil Code in 1999, although this being based in the Portuguese Code of 1966.
Also the civil code of Spain of 1889 would be enforced in its colony, the Philippines, and this would remain in effect even after the end of Spanish rule until the Philippines enacted its own Civil Code in 1950 after almost fifty years of U.S. rule.

Many legal systems of other countries in Asia are within the civil law tradition and have enacted a civil code, mostly derived from the German civil code; that is the case of China, Japan, Korea, Thailand (the Civil and Commercial Code), Taiwan and Indonesia (which is influenced by the Dutch Civil Code, ).

The Indian Constitution in its Directive Principles of State Policy recommends to a Uniform Civil Code in ts Article 44. The Indian parliament is yet to pass a law in this regard.

==Contents of a civil code==
A typical civil code deals with the fields of law known to the common lawyer as law of contracts, torts, property law, family law and the law of inheritance. Commercial law, corporate law and civil procedure are usually codified separately.

The older civil codes such as the French, Egyptian, Austrian and Spanish ones are structured under the Institutional System of the Roman jurist Gaius and generally have three large parts:
* Law of Persons (&quot;personae&quot;)
* Law of Things (&quot;res&quot;)
* Issues common to both parts (&quot;actiones&quot;).

The newer codes such as the ones of Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Catalonia are structured according to the Pandectist System:
* General part
* Law of Obligation
* Law of Real Rights
* Family Law
* Law of Inheritance

The civil code of the state of Louisiana, following the institutions system, is divided into five parts:
* Preliminary Title
* Of Persons
* Things and Different Modifications of Ownership
* Of Different Modes of Acquiring the Ownership of Things
* Conflict of Laws

Pandectism also had an influence on the earlier codes and their interpretation. For example, Austrian civil law is typically taught according to the Pandect System (which was devised by German scholars in the time between the enactment of the Austrian and the German Codes), even though this is not consistent with the structure of the Code.

<doc id="218856" wikidata="Q7893196" url="?curid=218856" title="United States trademark law">
<text>A trademark is a word, phrase, or logo that identifies the source of goods or services. Trademark law protects a business&#x27; commercial identity or brand by discouraging other businesses from adopting a name or logo that is &quot;confusingly similar&quot; to an existing trademark. The goal is to allow consumers to easily identify the producers of goods and services and avoid confusion.

United States trademark law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. Common law trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marks—both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).

==History==
United States law has protected trademarks under state common law since colonial times, but it was not until 1870 that Congress first attempted to establish a federal trademark regime. This 1870 statute was purported to be an exercise of Congress&#x27; Copyright Clause powers, however, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the &quot;Trade-Mark Cases.&quot; In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905.

In the 1917 decision in &quot;Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co.&quot;, the federal courts created the &quot;Aunt Jemima Doctrine&quot; which protects a trademark even when used to sell a different product (in this case, pancake syrup instead of pancake mix).

In 1946, Congress passed the Lanham Act (). The Lanham Act defines federal trademark protection and trademark registration rules. The Lanham Act grants the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&quot;USPTO&quot;) administrative authority over trademark registration.

State law continues to add its own protection, complementing (and complicating) the federal trademark system.

Recent developments in U.S. trademark law have included the adoption of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (see Trademark dilution), the 1999 Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, and the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (see Trademark dilution).

==Purpose==
Trademark law protects a company&#x27;s goodwill, and helps consumers easily identify the source of the things they purchase.
In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, reduces the customer&#x27;s costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions, for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item—the item with this mark—is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby encourages the production of quality products and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer&#x27;s inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. [internal punctuation omitted]

==Symbols==
U.S. Trademark rights come in two types: common law and federal registration.
* ™ – Signifies common law trademark rights. Businesses automatically receive common law trademark rights by using a brand name or logo in the normal course of commerce.
* ® – Signifies a registered trademark. The ® symbol may only be used on a trademark that has been examined, approved and &quot;registered&quot; with the USPTO.

==Acquiring trademark rights==
Trademark rights are acquired through use of a mark in the normal course of commerce. For example, by using a brand name or logo on a product or its retail packaging.

===Trademarkable things===
A word, phrase, or logo can act as a trademark. But so can a slogan, a name, a scent, the shape of a product&#x27;s container, and a series of musical notes.
The language of the Lanham Act describes that universe [of things that can qualify as a trademark] in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks &quot;includ[e] any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof.&quot; § 1127. Since human beings might use as a &quot;symbol&quot; or &quot;device&quot; almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particular sound (of NBC&#x27;s three chimes), and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread).

===Distinctiveness===

Some trademarks afford more potent rights than others. The closer the relationship between the mark and the goods, the weaker the mark. Trademarks are often separated into four categories of distinctiveness:
* Arbitrary and Fanciful (strongest)
* Suggestive (medium)
* Descriptive (weak)
* Generic (no protection)

====Arbitrary and fanciful====
Where there is no logical relationship between the mark and the goods or services, trademark protection is at its strongest. Arbitrary and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive and are prima facie registrable. For example, &quot;coined words&quot; – such as Kodak, Polaroid, or Starbucks – are considered fanciful and receive strong trademark protection. Arbitrary marks include preexisting words used in an arbitrary way, such as &quot;Apple&quot; when used for computers.

====Suggestive====
Suggestive trademarks are still broadly protected. These marks &quot;suggest&quot; something about the product or services they are used on. The suggestion is a subtle connotation, not an outright description of the product. An example is &quot;Whirlpool&quot; for washing machines.

====Descriptive====
Descriptive terms immediately describe the goods, or some important characteristic of the goods. Trademark law does not protect descriptive terms unless they achieve &quot;secondary meaning&quot; in the minds of consumers. That is, trademark rights accrue when the public comes to associate the descriptive term with a &quot;particular company&quot; rather than the &quot;product in general&quot;.

====Generic====
The generic term for a product or service cannot be trademarked. Granting trademark rights on a generic term-say &quot;apple&quot; for use on apple juice-puts other companies at an unfair competitive disadvantage. Every company has the right to describe its products and services using generic terms.

==Trademark registration==

Once acquired, trademark rights may be registered with the USPTO. &quot;The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to &quot;register&quot; a trademark, 15 U.S.C. § 1052, and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, § 1114(1).&quot;

===Benefits===
Trademark protection depends on use in commerce, not registration. Both registered and non-registered trademarks are eligible for protection under the Lanham Act. However, registration (on the &quot;Principal Register&quot;) affords several advantages:
* Nationwide trademark rights
* A registered mark is presumed to be a valid trademark
* The owner listed on the registration is presumed to be the true owner of the trademark rights
* Presumption that the mark has not been &quot;abandoned&quot; through non-use
* Access to Federal Courts for litigating trademark infringement
* &quot;Incontestability.&quot; After five years of unopposed registration, a trademark is eligible to become &quot;incontestable.&quot; An incontestable mark cannot be attacked on the grounds that it is &quot;merely descriptive.&quot;
* Constructive notice – that is, infringers cannot claim that they were unaware of a registered trademark
* Enhanced remedies for infringement, including the possibility of triple damages and criminal penalties for counterfeiting (note that counterfeiting is a more culpable type of infringement)
* Right to have the U.S. Customs Service prevent others from importing goods bearing infringing marks

===Application process===
Trademarks may be registered online. The USPTO charges a $275 fee for online trademark applications. The process takes about 6 months from initial application to final registration. It is a general practice to hire a trademark lawyer to file the application on behalf of the future owner.

Once the application is filed, it sits in a queue for a few months. Eventually, a USPTO Trademark Examiner will examine the application according to the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure. If the Trademark Examiner identifies problems with the applications, the applicant will be sent a &quot;preliminary rejection.&quot; The applicant will then have 6 months to file a reply with arguments in favor of their trademark application. If the Trademark Examiner is persuaded by the reply arguments, the application will be granted registration. If not, a &quot;final rejection&quot; will be issued.

When an application is allowed, it moves on to &quot;publication&quot; in the &quot;Trademark Official Gazette&quot;. Once published, there is a 30-day opportunity for other companies to appeal the registration. If no appeal is filed, the registration is finally issued.

If the registration receives a final rejection from the Trademark Examiner, the applicant may appeal the rejection to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Likewise, if the application is opposed by a third party, the appeal will be reviewed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

===Actual use vs. intent to use===
An application for registration may be based upon &quot;actual use&quot; in commerce (a §1(a) registration) or upon a &quot;bona fide&quot; intent to use (&quot;ITU&quot;) the mark in commerce (§1(b) registration). An ITU application is a placeholder. It will not be allowed to register until the applicant actually begins using the mark in interstate commerce. The value of ITU is in establishing &quot;priority&quot;—that is, determining which business first acquired the trademark rights.

===Principal and Supplemental Registers===
The benefits of federal trademark registration only accrue to marks listed on the &quot;Principal Register&quot;. To be eligible for the Principal Register, a mark must be recognized as a trademark, and not just a description of some goods or services. Eligible marks include (a) arbitrary or fanciful marks, (b) &quot;suggestive&quot; marks, and (c) descriptive marks that have achieved &quot;secondary meaning&quot; or &quot;distinctiveness.&quot;

The Supplemental Register is for &quot;descriptive&quot; marks that have not yet become distinctive. Descriptive marks describe some quality of the goods or services they are used with. Descriptive marks may become distinctive (acquire &quot;secondary meaning&quot;) through 5 years of use in commerce, or through evidence of heavy advertising and market recognition.

Secondary meaning is acquired when in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature... is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.

Note that &quot;generic&quot; terms are ineligible for trademark protection altogether, and may not be registered on either the Principal or Supplemental Registers.

===State-level===
Trademarks may also be registered at the state level. State registrations are less potent than federal trademark registration. But federal registration requires use of the mark in interstate commerce. If a mark is only used in one particular state, registration at the state level may be appropriate. State trademark registration is usually by filing an application with the Secretary of State of the relevant state.

==Infringement: likelihood of confusion test==
Trademark infringement is measured by the so-called &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; test. A new trademark will infringe on an existing one if the new one is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors, including:
* Strength of the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue
* Evidence of actual confusion
* Purchaser sophistication
* Quality of the defendant&#x27;s goods or services
* Whether the defendant&#x27;s attempt to register the trademark was bona fide (&quot;in good faith&quot;).

This multi-factor test was articulated by Judge Henry Friendly in &quot;Polaroid v. Polarad&quot;. and are often referred to as the &quot;Polaroid Factors&quot;.

Note that other factors may also be considered in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists. &quot;Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the possibilities—the court may have to take still other variables into account.&quot;

==Limits==
Consistent with the limited nature of trademark protection and the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment, U.S. law provides for a fair use defense to trademark infringement. Fair use in trademark law does not employ the same four-pronged analysis used in copyright law. The law recognizes two fair use defenses: classic fair use, where the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products; and nominative fair use, in which the trademark is being used to actually refer to the trademarked product or trademark owner.

These uses are still subject to the requirement that there be no consumer confusion as to source or sponsorship. Trademarks may also be lawfully used in parodies, since in that case there is usually no likelihood of confusion.

==Loss==

Trademark rights operate under a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; rule. In other words, the trademark owner must continuously use the mark in commerce or risk a finding of abandonment through nonuse (usually after three years of nonuse).

==Difference from similar laws==
In contrast to copyright or patent law, trademark protection does not have a set duration or definite expiration date. Trademark rights only expire when the owner stops using the mark in commerce. However, federal trademark registrations expire ten years after the registration date, unless renewed within one year prior to the expiration.

The U.S. Constitution specifically grants Congress power over copyright and patent law, but not over trademark law. Instead, Congress&#x27; power to create federal trademark law is derived from the Commerce Clause. Therefore, there must be some degree of interstate commerce present for a trademark to receive Lanham Act protection. The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the first federal trademark law by finding that Congress could not stretch the Copyright Clause to cover trademarks.

Unlike copyright law which provides for criminal penalties as well as civil damages, trademark law in the United States is almost entirely enforced through private lawsuits. The exception is in the case of criminal counterfeiting of goods. Otherwise, the responsibility is entirely on the mark owner to file suit in either state or federal civil court in order to restrict an infringing use. Failure to &quot;police&quot; a mark by stopping infringing uses can result in the loss of protection.

<text>The &#x27; (Latin for Annals of Wales&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is the title given to a complex of Latin chronicles compiled or derived from diverse sources at St David&#x27;s in Dyfed, Wales. The earliest is a 12th-century presumed copy of a mid-10th-century original; later editions were compiled in the 13th century. Despite the name, the record not only events in Wales, but also events in Ireland, Cornwall, England, Scotland and sometimes further afield, though the focus of the events recorded especially in the later two-thirds of the text is Wales.

==Sources==
The principal versions of appear in four manuscripts:
* A: London, British Library, Harley MS 3859, folios 190r–193r.
* B: London (Kew), National Archives, MS. E.164/1 (K.R. Misc. Books, Series I) pp. 2–26
* C: London, British Library, MS. Cotton Domitian A.i, folios 138r–155r
* D: Exeter, Cathedral Library, MS. 3514, pp. 523–28, the .
* E: &quot;ibid.&quot;, pp. 507–19, the .
*A is written in a hand of about 1100–1130 AD, and inserted without title into a manuscript (MS) of the where it is immediately followed by a pedigree for Owain ap Hywel (died 988). Although no explicit chronology is given in the MS, its annals seem to run from about AD 445 to 977 with the last entry at 954, making it likely that the text belongs to the second half of the 10th century.
*B was written, probably at the Cistercian abbey of Neath, at the end of the 13th century. It is entitled [1286].
*C is part of a book written at St David&#x27;s, and is entitled [1288]; this is also of the late 13th century.

Two of the texts, B and C, begin with a World Chronicle derived from Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Origines&quot; (Book V, ch. 39), through the medium of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Chronica minora&quot;. B begins its annals with Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Britain &quot;sixty years before the incarnation of the Lord.&quot; After A.D. 457, B agrees closely with A until A ends. C commences its annals after the empire of Heraclius (AD 610–41) at a year corresponding to AD 677. C mostly agrees with A until A ends, although it is clear that A was not the common source for B and C (Dumville 2002, p. xi). B and C diverge after 1203, C having fewer and briefer Welsh entries.

D and E are found in a manuscript written at the Cistercian abbey of Whitland in south-west Wales in the later 13th century; the &#x27; (which takes its title from its opening words) extends from 1132 BC to 1285 AD, while the &#x27; extends from 1190 to 1266.

A alone has benefited from a complete diplomatic edition (Phillimore 1888).

==Source for the Arthurian legend==
There are two entries in the on King Arthur, one on Medraut (Mordred), and one on Merlin. These entries have been presented in the past as proof of the existence of Arthur and Merlin, although that view is no longer widely held because the Arthurian entries could have been added arbitrarily as late as 970, long after the development of the early Arthurian myth.

The entries on Arthur and Mordred in the A Text:

:Year 72 (c. AD 516) The Battle of Badon, in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights and the Britons were victors.
:Year 93 (c. 537) The Strife of Camlann in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) fell and there was death in Britain and in Ireland.

Concerning Arthur&#x27;s cross at the Battle of Badon, it is mirrored by a passage in Nennius where Arthur was said to have borne the image of the Virgin Mary &quot;on his shoulders&quot; during a battle at a castle called Guinnion. The words for &quot;shoulder&quot; and &quot;shield&quot; were, however, easily confused in Old Welsh &quot;shield&quot; versus &quot;shoulder&quot; and Geoffrey of Monmouth played upon this dual tradition, describing Arthur bearing &quot;on his shoulders a shield&quot; emblazoned with the Virgin.

Merlin (Old Welsh Myrddin) is not mentioned in the A Text, though there is mention of the battle of Arfderydd, associated with him in medieval Welsh literature:

:Year 129 (c. 573) The Battle of Armterid

Texts B and C omit the second half of the year 93 entry. B calls Arfderydd &quot;Erderit&quot;; C, &quot;Arderit&quot;. In the B Text, the year 129 entry continues: &quot;between the sons of Elifer and Guendoleu son of Keidau in which battle Guendoleu fell and Merlin went mad&quot;. Both the B and C texts display the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and this is reflected in the Arfderydd entry by the choice of the Latinized form &quot;Merlinus&quot;, first found in Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, as opposed to the expected Old Welsh form &quot;Merdin&quot;.

<text>The Nguyễn dynasty (, chữ Nôm: 茹阮, chữ Hán: 朝阮) was the last Vietnamese dynasty, preceded by the Nguyễn lords and ruling unified Vietnam independently from 1802 until French protectorate in 1883. Its emperors were members of the House of Nguyễn Phúc. During its existence, the Nguyễn empire expanded into modern-day Southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos through a continuation of the centuries-long Nam tiến and Siamese–Vietnamese wars. With the French conquest of Vietnam, the Nguyễn dynasty was forced to give up sovereignty over parts of Southern Vietnam to France in 1862 and 1874, and after 1883 the Nguyễn dynasty only nominally ruled the French protectorates of Annam (Central Vietnam) as well as Tonkin (Northern Vietnam). Backed by Imperial Japan, in 1945 the last Nguyễn emperor Bảo Đại abolished the protectorate treaty with France and proclaimed the Empire of Vietnam for a short time until 25 August 1945.

The House of Nguyễn Phúc established control over large amounts of territory in Southern Vietnam as the Nguyễn lords (1558–1777, 1780–1802) by the 16th century before defeating the Tây Sơn dynasty and establishing their own imperial rule in the 19th century. The dynastic rule began with Gia Long ascending the throne in 1802, after ending the previous Tây Sơn dynasty. The Nguyễn dynasty was gradually absorbed by France over the course of several decades in the latter half of the 19th century, beginning with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858 which led to the occupation of the southern area of Vietnam. A series of unequal treaties followed; the occupied territory became the French colony of Cochinchina in the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and the 1863 Treaty of Huế gave France access to Vietnamese ports and increased control of its foreign affairs. Finally, the 1883 and 1884 Treaties of Huế divided the remaining Vietnamese territory into the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin under nominal Nguyễn Phúc rule. In 1887, Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin, and the French Protectorate of Cambodia were grouped together to form French Indochina.

The Nguyễn dynasty remained the formal emperors of Annam and Tonkin within Indochina until World War II. Japan had occupied Indochina with French collaboration in 1940, but as the war seemed increasingly lost, Japan overthrew the French administration on 9 March 1945 and the Nguyễn dynasty proclaimed independence for its constituent protectorates two days later. It also regained Cochinchina on 14 August 1945. The Empire of Vietnam under Nguyễn Emperor Bảo Đại was a nominally independent state but actually a Japanese puppet state during the last months of the war. It ended with the abdication of Bảo Đại following the surrender of Japan then August Revolution led by the communist Việt Minh in August 1945. This ended the 143-year rule of the Nguyễn dynasty.

== Names ==
=== Việt Nam ===
The name (, chữ Hán: ) is a variation of (; literally &quot;Southern &quot;Việt&quot;), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu dynasty of the second century BC. The term &quot; (Yue) () in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph &quot;戉&quot; for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as &quot;越&quot;. At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early eighth century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the seventh and fourth centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the third century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, ; ). The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; compiled around 239 BC. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, educated Vietnamese called themselves and their people as &quot;người Việt&quot; and &quot;người Nam&quot;, which combined to become &quot;người Việt Nam&quot; (Vietnamese people). However, this designation was for the Vietnamese themselves and not for the whole country.

The form () is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem &quot;Sấm Trạng Trình&quot;. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Hải Phòng that dates to 1558. In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguyễn dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title &#x27;King of Nam Việt / Nanyue&#x27; ( in Chinese character) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused because the name was related to Zhao Tuo&#x27;s Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area &quot;Việt Nam&quot; instead. Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.

=== Đại Nam ===
In 1839, under the rule of Emperor Minh Mạng&#x27;s, the official name of the empire was Đại Việt Nam (大越南, which means &quot;Great Vietnam&quot;), and it was shortened to &quot;Đại Nam&quot; (大南, which means &quot;Great South&quot;).

=== Nam Triều ===

During the 1930s its government used the name &quot;Nam Triều&quot; (南朝, Southern dynasty) on its official documents.

=== Other names ===

Westerners in the past often called the kingdom &quot;Annam&quot; or the &quot;Annamite Empire.&quot; However, in Vietnamese historiography, modern historians often refer to this period in Vietnamese history as Nguyễn Vietnam, or simply Vietnam to distinguish with the pre-19th century Đại Việt kingdom.

== History ==
=== Background and establishment ===
==== Origin of Nguyễn clan ====

The Nguyễn clan, which originated in the Thanh Hóa Province had long exerted substantial political influence and military power throughout early modern Vietnamese history through one form or another. The clan&#x27;s affiliations with the ruling elites dated back to the tenth century when Nguyễn Bặc was appointed the first grand chancellor of the short-lived Đinh dynasty under emperor Đinh Bộ Lĩnh in 965. Another instance of their influences materializes through Nguyễn Thị Anh, the empress consort of emperor Lê Thái Tông; she served as the official regent of Đại Việt for her son, the child emperor Lê Nhân Tông between 1442 and 1453.

==== Lê dynasty&#x27;s loyal vassal ====
In 1527, Mạc Đăng Dung, after defeating and executing the Lê dynasty&#x27;s vassal, Nguyễn Hoằng Dụ in a rebellion, emerged as the intermediate victor and established the Mạc dynasty. He did this by deposing the Lê emperor, Lê Cung Hoàng, taking the throne for himself, effectively ending the once prosperous but declining later Lê dynasty. Nguyễn Hoằng Dụ&#x27;s son, Nguyễn Kim, the leader of the Nguyễn clan with his allies, the Trịnh clan remained fiercely loyal to the Lê dynasty. They attempted to restore the Lê dynasty to power, igniting an anti-Mạc rebellion, in favor of the loyalist cause. Both the Trịnh and Nguyễn clan again took up arms in Thanh Hóa province and revolted against the Mạc. However the initial rebellion failed and the loyalist forces had to fled to the kingdom of Lan Xang, where king Photisarath allows them to establish an exiled loyalist government in Xam Neua (modern day Laos). The Lê loyalists under Lê Ninh, a descendant of the imperial family, escaped to Muang Phuan (today Laos). During this exile, the Marquis of An Thanh, Nguyễn Kim summoned those who were still loyal to the Lê emperor and formed a new army to begin another revolt against Mạc Đăng Dung. In 1539, the coalition returned to Đại Việt beginning their military campaign against the Mạc in Thanh Hóa, capturing the Tây Đô in 1543.
==== Nguyễn&#x27;s dominion in the south ====

In 1539, the Lê dynasty was restored in opposition to the Mạc in Thăng Long, this occurred after the loyalist&#x27;s capture of Thanh Hoá province, reinstalling the Lê emperor Lê Trang Tông on the throne. However, the Mạc at this point still controls most of the country, including the capital, Thăng Long. Nguyễn Kim, who had served as leader of the loyalists throughout the 12 years of the Lê–Mạc War (from 1533 to 1545) and throughout the Northern and Southern dynasties period, was assassinated in 1545 by a captured Mạc general, Dương Chấp Nhất. Shortly after Nguyễn Kim&#x27;s death, his son-in-law, Trịnh Kiểm, leader of the Trịnh clan, killed Nguyễn Uông, the eldest son of Kim to take over the control of the loyalist forces. The sixth son of Kim, Nguyễn Hoàng, fears that his fate will be like his elder brother; therefore, he tried to escape the capital to avoid the purges. Later, he asks his sister, Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Bảo (the wife of Trịnh Kiểm) to ask Kiểm to appoint him to be the governor of far-south frontier of Đại Việt, Thuận Hóa (modern Quảng Bình to Quảng Nam provinces). Trịnh Kiểm, thinking of this proposal as an opportunity to remove the power and influence of Nguyễn Hoàng away from the capital city, agreed to the proposal.

In 1558, Lê Anh Tông, emperor of the newly-restored Lê dynasty appointed Nguyễn Hoàng to the lordship of the Thuận Hóa, the territory which have been previously conquered during the 15th century from the Champa kingdom. This event of Nguyễn Hoàng leaving Thăng Long laid the foundation for the eventual fragmentation and division of Đại Việt later down the road as the Trịnh clan would solidify their power in the North, establishing a unique political system where the Lê emperors would reign (as figureheads) yet the Trịnh lords would rule (wielding actual political power). Meanwhile the descendants of the Nguyễn clan, through the bloodline of Nguyễn Hoàng would rule in the South; the Nguyễn clan, just like their Trịnh relatives in the north, recognize the authority of the Lê emperors over Đại Việt yet at the same time solely exercise political power over their own territory. The official schism of the two families however, would not begin until 1627, the first war between the two.

Nguyễn Phúc Lan chose the city of Phú Xuân in 1636 as his residence and established the dominion of the Nguyễn lord in the southern part of the country. Although the Nguyễn and Trịnh lords ruled as de facto rulers in their respective lands, they paid official tribute to the Lê emperors in a ceremonial gesture, and recognize Lê dynasty as the legitimacy of Đại Việt.
====Nguyễn-Trịnh confrontation====
Nguyễn Hoàng and his successors started to engage in rivalry with the Trịnh lords, after refusing to pay tax and tribute to the central government in Hanoi as Nguyễn lords tried to create the autonomous regime. They expanded their territory by making parts of Cambodia as a protectorate, invaded Laos, captured the last vestiges of Champa in 1693 and ruled in an unbroken line until 1776.
===Tây Sơn–Nguyễn war (1771–1802)===
====The end of the Nguyễn lords&#x27; reign====

The 17th-century war between the Trịnh and the Nguyễn ended in an uneasy peace, with the two sides creating de facto separate states although both professed loyalty to the same Lê dynasty. After 100 years of domestic peace, the Nguyễn lords were confronted with the Tây Sơn rebellion in 1774. Its military had had considerable losses in manpower after a series of campaigns in Cambodia and proved unable to contain the revolt. By the end of the year, the Trịnh lords had formed an alliance with the Tây Sơn rebels and captured Huế in 1775.

Nguyễn lord, Nguyễn Phúc Thuần fled south to the Quảng Nam province, where he left a garrison under co-ruler Nguyễn Phúc Dương. He fled further south to the Gia Định Province (around modern-day Ho Chi Minh City) by sea before the arrival of Tây Sơn leader Nguyễn Nhạc, whose forces defeated the Nguyễn garrison and seized Quảng Nam.

In early 1777 a large Tây Sơn force under Nguyễn Huệ and Nguyễn Lữ attacked and captured Gia Định from the sea and defeated the Nguyễn Lord forces. The Tây Sơn received widespread popular support as they presented themselves as champions of the Vietnamese people, who rejected any foreign influence and fought for the full reinstitution of the Lê dynasty. Hence, the elimination of the Nguyễn and Trinh lordships was considered a priority and all but one member of the Nguyễn family captured at Saigon were executed.

====Nguyễn Ánh escapes====
In 1775, the 13-year-old Nguyễn Ánh escaped and with the help of the Vietnamese Catholic priest Paul Hồ Văn Nghị soon arrived at the Paris Foreign Missions Society in Hà Tiên. With Tây Son search parties closing in, he kept on moving and eventually met the French missionary Pigneau de Behaine. By retreating to the Thổ Chu Islands in the Gulf of Thailand, both escaped Tây Sơn capture.

Pigneau de Behaine decided to support Ánh, who had declared himself heir to the Nguyễn lordship. A month later the Tây Sơn army under Nguyễn Huệ had returned to Quy Nhơn. Ánh seized the opportunity and quickly raised an army at his new base in Long Xuyên, marched to Gia Định and occupied the city in December 1777. The Tây Sơn returned to Gia Định in February 1778 and recaptured the province. When Ánh approached with his army, the Tây Sơn retreated.

By the summer of 1781, Ánh&#x27;s forces had grown to 30,000 soldiers, 80 battleships, three large ships and two Portuguese ships procured with the help of de Behaine. Ánh organized an unsuccessful ambush of the Tây Sơn base camps in the Phú Yên province. In March 1782 the Tây Sơn emperor Thái Đức and his brother Nguyễn Huệ sent a naval force to attack Ánh. Ánh&#x27;s army was defeated and he fled via Ba Giồng to Svay Rieng in Cambodia.

==== Nguyễn–Cambodian agreement ====
Ánh met with the Cambodian King Ang Eng, who granted him exile and offered support in his struggle with the Tây Sơn. In April 1782 a Tây Sơn army invaded Cambodia, detained and forced Ang Eng to pay tribute, and demanded, that all Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia were to return to Vietnam.

==== Chinese Vietnamese support for Nguyễn Ánh ====
Support by the Chinese Vietnamese began when the Qing dynasty overthrew the Ming dynasty. The Han Chinese refused to live under the Manchu Qing and fled to Southeast Asia (including Vietnam). Most were welcomed by the Nguyễn lords to resettle in southern Vietnam and set up business and trade.

In 1782, Nguyễn Ánh escaped to Cambodia and the Tây Sơn seized southern Vietnam (now Cochinchina). They had discriminated against the ethnic Chinese, displeasing the Chinese-Vietnamese. That April, Nguyễn loyalists Tôn Thất Dụ, Trần Xuân Trạch, Trần Văn Tự and Trần Công Chương sent military support to Ánh. The Nguyễn army killed grand admiral Phạm Ngạn, who had a close relationship with Emperor Thái Đức, at Tham Lương bridge. Thái Đức, angry, thought that the ethnic Chinese had collaborated in the killing. He sacked the town of Cù lao (present-day Biên Hòa), which had a large Chinese population, and ordered the oppression of the Chinese community to avenge their assistance to Ánh. Ethnic cleansing had previously occurred in Hoi An, leading to support by wealthy Chinese for Ánh. He returned to Giồng Lữ, defeated Admiral Nguyễn Học of the Tây Sơn and captured eighty battleships. Ánh then began a campaign to reclaim southern Vietnam, but Nguyễn Huệ deployed a naval force to the river and destroyed his navy. Ánh again escaped with his followers to Hậu Giang. Cambodia later cooperated with the Tây Sơn to destroy Ánh&#x27;s force and made him retreat to Rạch Giá, then to Hà Tiên and Phú Quốc.

====Nguyễn–Siam alliance====

Following consecutive losses to the Tây Sơn, Ánh sent his general Châu Văn Tiếp to Siam to request military assistance. Siam, under Chakri rule, wanted to conquer Cambodia and southern Vietnam. King Rama I agreed to ally with the Nguyễn lord and intervene militarily in Vietnam. Châu Văn Tiếp sent a secret letter to Ánh about the alliance. After meeting with Siamese generals at Cà Mau, Ánh, thirty officials and some troops visited Bangkok to meet Rama I in May 1784. The governor of Gia Định Province, Nguyễn Văn Thành, advised Ánh against foreign assistance.
Rama I, fearing the growing influence of the Tây Sơn dynasty in Cambodia and Laos, decided to dispatch his army against it. In Bangkok, Ánh began to recruit Vietnamese refugees in Siam to join his army (which totaled over 9,000). He returned to Vietnam and prepared his forces for the Tây Sơn campaign in June 1784, after which he captured Gia Định. Rama I nominated his nephew, Chiêu Tăng, as admiral the following month. The admiral led Siamese forces including 20,000 marine troops and 300 warships from the Gulf of Siam to Kiên Giang Province. In addition, more than 30,000 Siamese infantry troops crossed the Cambodian border to An Giang Province. On 25 November 1784, Admiral Châu Văn Tiếp died in battle against the Tây Sơn in Mang Thít District, Vĩnh Long Province. The alliance was largely victorious from July through November, and the Tây Sơn army retreated north. However, Emperor Nguyễn Huệ halted the retreat and counter-attacked the Siamese forces in December. In the decisive battle of Rạch Gầm–Xoài Mút, more than 20,000 Siamese soldiers died and the remainder retreated to Siam.

Ánh, disillusioned with Siam, escaped to Thổ Chu Island in April 1785 and then to Ko Kut Island in Thailand. The Siamese army escorted him back to Bangkok, and he was briefly exiled in Thailand.

==== French assistance ====
The war between the Nguyễn lord and the Tây Sơn dynasty forced Ánh to find more allies. His relationship with de Behaine improved, and support for an alliance with France increased. Before the request for Siamese military assistance, de Behaine was in Chanthaburi and Ánh asked him to come to Phú Quốc Island. Ánh asked him to contact King Louis XVI of France for assistance; de Behaine agreed to coordinate an alliance between France and Vietnam, and Ánh gave him a letter to present at the French court. Ánh&#x27;s oldest son, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, was chosen to accompany de Behaine. Due to inclement weather, the voyage was postponed until December 1784. The group departed from Phú Quốc Island for Malacca and thence to Pondicherry, and Ánh moved his family to Bangkok. The group arrived in Lorient in February 1787, and Louis XVI agreed to meet them in May.

On 28 November 1787, Behaine signed the Treaty of Versailles with French Minister of Foreign Affairs Armand Marc at the Palace of Versailles on behalf of Nguyễn Ánh. The treaty stipulated that France provide four frigates, 1,200 infantry troops, 200 artillery, 250 cafres (African soldiers), and other equipment. Nguyễn Ánh ceded the Đà Nẵng estuary and Côn Sơn Island to France. The French were allowed to trade freely and control foreign trade in Vietnam. Vietnam had to build one ship per year which was similar to the French ship which brought aid and gave it to France. Vietnam was obligated to supply food and other aid to France when the French were at war with other East Asian nations.

On 27 December 1787, Pigneau de Behaine and Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh left France for Pondicherry to wait for the military support promised by the treaty. However, due to the French Revolution and the abolition of the French monarchy, the treaty was never executed. Thomas Conway, who was responsible for French assistance, refused to provide it. Although the treaty was not implemented, de Behaine recruited French businessman who intended to trade in Vietnam and raised funds to assist Nguyễn Ánh. He spent fifteen thousand francs of his own money to purchase guns and warships. Cảnh and de Behaine returned to Gia Định in 1788 (after Nguyễn Ánh had recaptured it), followed by a ship with the war materiel. Frenchmen who were recruited included Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, Philippe Vannier, Olivier de Puymanel, and Jean-Marie Dayot. A total of twenty people joined Ánh&#x27;s army. The French purchased and supplied equipment and weaponry, reinforcing the defense of Gia Định, Vĩnh Long, Châu Đốc, Hà Tiên, Biên Hòa, Bà Rịa and training Ánh&#x27;s artillery and infantry according to the European model.

==== Qing China–Lê alliance against Tây Sơn ====

In 1786, Nguyễn Huệ led the army against the Trịnh lords; Trịnh Khải escaped to the north but got captured by the local people. He then committed suicide. After the Tây Sơn army returned to Quy Nhơn, subjects of the Trịnh lord restored Trịnh Bồng (son of Trịnh Giang) as the next lord. Lê Chiêu Thống, emperor of the Lê dynasty, wanted to regain power from the Trịnh. He summoned Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh, governor of Nghệ An, to attack the Trịnh lord at the Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long. Trịnh Bồng surrendered to the Lê and became a monk. Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh wanted to unify the country under Lê rule, and began to prepare the army to march south and attack the Tây Sơn. Huệ led the army, killed Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh, and captured the later Lê capital. The Lê imperial family were exiled to China, and the later Lê dynasty collapsed.

At that time, Nguyễn Huệ&#x27;s influence became stronger in northern Vietnam; this made Emperor Nguyễn Nhạc of the Tây Sơn dynasty suspect Huệ&#x27;s loyalty. The relationship between the brothers became tense, eventually leading to battle. Huệ had his army surround Nhạc&#x27;s capital, at Quy Nhơn citadel, in 1787. Nhạc begged Huệ not to kill him, and they reconciled. In 1788, Lê emperor Lê Chiêu Thống fled to China and asked for military assistance. The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing ordered Sun Shiyi to lead the military campaign into Vietnam. The campaign failed, and later on, the Qing recognized the Tây Sơn as the legitimate dynasty in Vietnam. However, with the death of Huệ (1792), the Tây Sơn dynasty began to weaken.

==== Franco–Nguyễn alliance against Tây Sơn ====
===== Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s counter-attack =====
Ánh began to reorganize a strong armed force in Siam. He left Siam (after thanking King Rama I), and returned to Vietnam. During the 1787 war between Nguyễn Huệ and Nguyễn Nhạc in northern Vietnam, Ánh recaptured the southern Vietnamese capital of Gia Định. Southern Vietnam had been ruled by the Nguyễns and they remained popular, especially with the ethnic Chinese. Nguyễn Lữ, the youngest brother of Tây Sơn (who ruled southern Vietnam), could not defend the citadel and retreated to Quy Nhơn. The citadel of Gia Định was seized by the Nguyễn lords.
In 1788 de Behaine and Ánh&#x27;s son, Prince Cảnh, arrived in Gia Định with modern war equipment and more than twenty Frenchmen who wanted to join the army. The force was trained and strengthened with French assistance.

===== Defeat of the Tây Sơn =====

After the fall of the citadel at Gia Định, Nguyễn Huệ prepared an expedition to reclaim it before his death on 16 September 1792. His young son, Nguyễn Quang Toản, succeeded him as emperor of the Tây Sơn and was a poor leader. In 1793, Nguyễn Ánh began a campaign against Quang Toản. Due to conflict between officials of the Tây Sơn court, Quang Toản lost battle after battle. In 1797, Ánh and Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh attacked Qui Nhơn (then in Phú Yên Province) in the Battle of Thị Nại. They were victorious, capturing a large amount of Tây Sơn equipment. Quang Toản became unpopular due to his murders of generals and officials, leading to a decline in the army. In 1799, Ánh captured the citadel of Quy Nhơn. He seized the capital (Phú Xuân) on 3 May 1801, and Quang Toản retreated north. On 20 July 1802, Ánh captured Hanoi and end the Tây Sơn dynasty, all of the members of the Tây Sơn was captured. Ánh then executed all the members of the Tây Sơn dynasty that year.

=== Imperial rule (1802–1883) ===

==== Overview ====

In Vietnamese historiography, the independent period is referred to as the Nhà Nguyễn thời độc lập period. During this period the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s territories comprised the present-day territories of Vietnam and parts of modern Cambodia and Laos, bordering Siam to the west and Manchu Qing dynasty to the north. The ruling Nguyễn emperors established and ran the first well-defined imperial administrative and bureaucratic system of Vietnam and annexed Cambodia and Champa into its territories in the 1830s. Together with Chakri Siam and Konbaung Burma, it was one among three major Southeast Asian powers at the time. The emperor Gia Long was relatively friendly toward Western powers and Christianity. After his reign of Minh Mạng brought a new approach, he ruled for 21 years from 1820 to 1841, as a conservative and Confucian ruler; introducing a policy of isolationism which kept the country from the rest of the world for nearly 40 years until the French invasion in 1858. Minh Mạng tightened control over Catholicism, Muslim, and ethnic minorities, resulting in more than two hundred rebellions across the country during his twenty-one-year reign. He also further expanded Vietnamese imperialism in modern-day Laos and Cambodia.

Minh Mạng&#x27;s successors, Thiệu Trị (r. 1841–1847) and Tự Đức (r. 1847–1883) would be assailed by serious problems that ultimately decimated the Vietnamese state. In the late 1840s, Vietnam was struck by the global cholera pandemic that killed roughly 8% of the country&#x27;s population, while the countries isolationist policies damaged the economy. France and Spain declared war on Vietnam in September 1858. Faced with these industrialised powers, the hermit Nguyễn dynasty and its military crumbled, the alliance capturing Saigon in early 1859. A series of unequal treaties followed with first the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and then the 1863 Treaty of Huế which gave France access to Vietnamese ports and increased control of its foreign affairs. The Treaty of Saigon (1874) concluded the French annexation of Cochinchina that had begun in 1862.

The last independent Nguyễn emperor of note was Tự Đức. Upon his death, a succession crisis followed, as the regent Tôn Thất Thuyết orchestrated the murders of three emperors in a year. This presented an opportunity to the French. The Huế court was forced to sign the Harmand Convention in September 1883, which formalised the handover of Tonkin to the French administration. After the Treaty of Patenôtre was signed in 1884, France finished its annexation and partitioning of Vietnam into three constituent protectorates of French Indochina, and turned the Nguyễn into a vassal monarchy. Finally, the Treaty of Tientsin (1885) between the Chinese Empire and the French Republic was signed on 9 June 1885 recognizing French dominion over Vietnam. All emperors after Đồng Khánh were chosen by the French, and only ruled symbolically.

==== Gia Long period ====
Nguyễn Phúc Ánh united Vietnam after a three-hundred-year division of the country. He celebrated his coronation at Huế on 1 June 1802 and proclaimed himself emperor (), with the era name Gia Long (嘉隆). This title emphasized his rule from &quot;Gia&quot; Định region (modern-day Saigon) in the far south to Thăng &quot;Long&quot; (modern-day Hanoi) in the north. Gia Long prioritized the nation&#x27;s defense and worked to avoid another civil war. He replaced the feudal system with a reformist &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, based on Confucianism. The Nguyen dynasty was founded as a tributary state of the Qing Empire, with Gia Long receiving an imperial pardon and recognition as the ruler of Vietnam from the Jiaqing Emperor for recognizing Chinese suzerainty. The envoys sent to China to acquire this recognition cited the ancient kingdom of Nanyue (Vietnamese: &quot;Nam Việt&quot;) to Emperor Jiaqing as the countries name, this displeased the emperor who was disconcerted by such pretentions, and Nguyễn Phúc Ánh had to officially rename his kingdom as &quot;Vietnam&quot; the next year to satisfy the emperor. The country was officially known as &#x27;The (Great) Vietnamese state&#x27; (Vietnamese: Đại Việt Nam quốc),

Gia Long asserted that he was reviving the bureaucratic state that was built by King Lê Thánh Tông during the fifteenth-century golden age (1470–1497), as such he adopted a Confucian-bureaucratic government model, and sought unification with northern literati. To ensure stability over the unified kingdom, he placed two of his most loyal and Confucian-educated advisors, Nguyễn Văn Thành and Lê Văn Duyệt as viceroys of Hanoi and Saigon. From 1780 to 1820, roughly 300 Frenchmen served Gia Long&#x27;s court as officials. Seeing the French influence in Vietnam with alarm, the British Empire sent two envoys to Gia Long in 1803 and 1804 to convince him to abandon his friendship with the French. In 1808, a British fleet led by William O&#x27;Bryen Drury mounted an attack on the Red River Delta, but was soon driven back by the Vietnamese navy and suffered several losses. After the Napoleonic War and Gia Long&#x27;s death, the British Empire renewed relations with Vietnam in 1822. During his reign, a system of roads connecting Hanoi, Hue, and Saigon with postal stations and inns was established, several canals connecting the Mekong River to the Gulf of Siam were constructed and finished. In 1812, Gia Long issued the Gia Long Code, which was instituted based on the Ch&#x27;ing Code of China, replaced the previous Thánh Tông&#x27;s 1480 Code. In 1811, a coup d&#x27;état broke out in the Kingdom of Cambodia, a Vietnamese tributary state, forcing the pro-Vietnamese King Ang Chan II to seek support from Vietnam. Gia Long sent 13,000 men to Cambodia, successfully restoring his vassal to his throne, and beginning a more formal occupation of the country for the next 30 years, while Siam seized northern Cambodia in 1814.

Gia Long died in 1819 and was succeeded by his fourth son, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, who soon became known as Emperor Minh Mạng (r. 1820–1841) of Vietnam.

==== Rise and expansion under Minh Mạng ====

Minh Mạng was the younger brother of prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh and fourth son of Emperor Gia Long. Educated in Confucian principles from youth, Minh Mạng became the Emperor of Vietnam in 1820, during a deadly cholera outbreak that ravaged and killed 200,000 people across the country. His reign mainly focused on centralizing and stabilizing the state, by abolishing the Viceroy system and implementing a new full bureaucracy-provincial-based administration. He also halted diplomacy with Europe, and cracked down on religious minorities.

Minh Mạng shunned relations with the European powers. By 1824, after the death of Jean Marie Despiau, no Western advisors who had served Gia Long remained in Minh Mạng&#x27;s court. The last French consul of Vietnam, Eugene Chaigneau, was never able to obtain audience with Minh Mạng. After he left, France ceased attempts at contact. In the next year he launched an anti-Catholicism propaganda campaign, denouncing the religion as &quot;vicious&quot; and full of &quot;false teaching.&quot; In 1832 Minh Mạng turned the Cham Principality of Thuận Thành into a Vietnamese province, the final conquest in a long history of colonial conflict between Cham and Vietnam. He coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus in violation of their religions to forcibly assimilate them to Vietnamese culture. The first Cham revolt for independence took place in 1833–1834 when Katip Sumat, a Cham mullah who had just returned to Vietnam from Mecca declared a holy war (jihad) against the Vietnamese emperor. The rebellion failed to gain the support of the Cham elite and was quickly suppressed by the Vietnamese military. A second revolt began the following year, led by a Muslim clergy named Ja Thak with support from the old Cham royalty, highland people, and Vietnamese dissents. Minh Mạng mercilessly crushed the Ja Thak rebellion and executed the last Cham ruler Po Phaok The in early 1835.

In 1833, as Minh Mạng had been trying to take firm control over the six southern provinces, a large rebellion led by Lê Văn Khôi (an adopted son of the Saigon viceroy Lê Văn Duyệt) broke out in Saigon, attempting to place Minh Mang&#x27;s brother Prince Cảnh on the throne. The rebellion lasted for two years, gathering much support from Vietnamese Catholics, Khmers, Chinese merchants in Saigon, and even the Siamese ruler Rama III until it was crushed by the government forces in 1835. In January, he issued the first country-wide prohibition of Catholicism, and began persecuting Christians. 130 Christian missionaries, priests and church leaders were executed, dozens of churches were burned and destroyed.

==== War with Siam and invasion of Cambodia ====
Minh Mạng also expanded his empire westward, putting central and southern Laos under Cam Lộ Province, and collided with his father&#x27;s former ally – Siam, in Vientiane and Cambodia. He backed the revolt of Laotian king Anouvong of Vientiane against the Siamese, and seized Xam Neua and Savannakhet in 1827.

In 1834, the Vietnamese Crown fully annexed Cambodia and renamed it to Tây Thành Province. Minh Mạng placed the general Trương Minh Giảng as the governor of the Cambodian province, expanding his forcible religious assimilation to the new territory. King Ang Chan II of Cambodia died in the next year and Ming Mang installed Chan&#x27;s daughter Ang Mey as Commandery Princess of Cambodia. Cambodian officials were required to wear Vietnamese-style clothing, and govern in Vietnamese style. However the Vietnamese rule over Cambodia did not last long and proved draining to Vietnam&#x27;s economy to maintain. Minh Mạng died in 1841, while a Khmer uprising was in progress with Siamese support, putting an end to the Tây Thành province and Vietnamese control of Cambodia.

==== Decline of the Nguyễn dynasty ====

Over the next forty years, Vietnam was ruled by two further independent emperors Thiệu Trị (r. 1841–1847) and Tự Đức (r. 1848–1883). Thiệu Trị or Prince Miên Tông, was the eldest son of Emperor Minh Mạng. His six-year reign showed a significant decrease in Catholic persecution. With the population growing fast from 6 million in the 1820s to 10 million in 1850, the attempts at agricultural self sufficiency were proving unworkable. Between 1802 and 1862, the court had faced 405 minor and large revolts of peasants, political dissents, ethnic minorities, Lê loyalists (people that were loyal to the old Lê Duy dynasty) across the country, this made responding to the challenge of European colonisers significantly more challenging.

In 1845, the American warship USS Constitution landed in &quot;Đà Nẵng&quot;, taking all local officials hostage with the demands that Thiệu Trị free imprisoned French bishop Dominique Lefèbvre. In 1847, Thiệu Trị had made peace with Siam, but the imprisonment of Dominique Lefebvre offered an excuse for French and British aggression. In April the French navy attacked the Vietnamese and sank many Vietnamese ships in Đà Nẵng, demanding the release of Lefèbvre. Angered by the incident, Thiệu Trị ordered all European documents in his palace to be smashed, and all European caught on Vietnamese land were to immediate execution. In autumn, two British warships of Sir John Davis arrived in Đà Nẵng and attempted to force a commercial treaty on Vietnam, but the emperor refused. He died a few days later of apoplexy.

Tự Đức, or Prince Hồng Nhậm was Thiệu Trị&#x27;s youngest son, well-educated in Confucian learning, he was crowned by minister and co-regent Trương Đăng Quế. Prince Hồng Bảo-the elder brother of Tự Đức, the primogeniture heir rebelled against Tự Đức on the day of his accession. This coup failed but he was spared execution on the intervention of Từ Dụ, with his sentence being reduced to life imprisonment. Aware of the rise of Western influences in Asia, Tự Đức confirmed his grandfathers isolationist policy towards the European powers, prohibiting embassies, forbidding trade and contact with foreigners and renewing the persecution of Catholics his grandfather had orchestrated. During Tự Đức&#x27;s first twelve years, Vietnamese Catholics faced harsh persecution with 27 European missionaries, 300 Vietnamese priests and bishops, and 30,000 Vietnamese Christians executed and crucified from 1848 to 1860.

In the late 1840s, another cholera outbreak hit Vietnam, having travelled from India. The epidemic quickly spread out of control and killed 800,000 people (8–10% of Vietnam&#x27;s 1847 population) across the Empire. Locusts plagued northern Vietnam in 1854, and a major rebellion in the following year damaged much of the Tonkin countryside. These various crises weakened the empire&#x27;s control over Tonkin considerably.

In the 1850–70s, a new class of liberal intellectuals emerged in the court as persecution relaxed, many of them Catholics who had studied abroad in Europe, most notably Nguyễn Trường Tộ, who urged the emperor to reform and transform the Empire following the Western model and open Vietnam to the west. Despite their efforts the conservative Confucian bureaucrats and Tự Đức himself had a literal interest in such reforms. The economy remained largely agricultural, with 95% of the population living in rural areas, only mining offered potential to the modernist&#x27;s dreams of a western-style state.

==== French conquest ====


In September 1858, Napoleon III orchestrated a Franco-Spanish army bombardment and invaded Đà Nẵng to protest against the executions of two Spanish Dominican missionaries. Seven months later, they sailed to the south to attack Saigon and the rich Mekong Delta. The Alliance troops held Saigon for two years, while a rebellion of Lê loyalists led by Catholic bishop Pedro Tạ Văn Phụng, who proclaimed himself to be a Lê prince, broke out in the north and escalated. Alongside the pretext of avenging the death of the missionaries the French invasion was designed to prove to Europe that France wasn&#x27;t a second-rate power, and &#x27;civilize&#x27; the area. In February 1861, French reinforcement and 70 warships led by General Vassoigne arrived and overwhelmed the Vietnamese strongholds. Facing the Alliance invasion and internal rebellion, Tự Đức chose to cede three Southern provinces to France to deal with the coinciding rebellion.


In June 1862, the Treaty of Saigon was signed, resulting in Vietnam losing three southern provinces; Gia Định, Mỹ Tho, Biên Hòa which became the basis of French Cochinchina. In the Treaty of Huế (1863) the island of Poulo Condoræ would allow Catholicism, three ports would be open to French trade, and the sea opened to allow French expansion into Kampuchea. and war reparations were required to be sent to France. Despite the religious elements of this treaty, France would not intervene in the Christian revolt in Northern Vietnam, even with their missionaries urging them to. To the Queen dowager, Từ Dụ, the court, and the people, the 1862 treaty was a national humiliation. Tự Đức once again sent a mission to the French Emperor Napoleon III, in which he called to revise the 1862 treaty. In July 1864, another draft treaty was signed. France returned the three provinces to Vietnam, but still held control over three important cities Saigon, Mỹ Tho, and Thủ Dầu Một. In 1866, France convinced Tự Đức to hand over the southern provinces of Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên, and Châu Đốc. Phan Thanh Giản, the governor of the three provinces immediately resigned. Without resistance, in 1867, the French annexed the provinces and turned their attention to the northern provinces.
By the late 1860s, pirates, bandits, and remnants of the Taiping rebellion in China, fled to Tonkin and turned Northern Vietnam into a hotbed for their raid activities. The Vietnamese state was too weak to fight against the pirates. These Chinese rebels eventually formed their own mercenary armies as the Black Flags had done and cooperated with local Vietnamese officials to interfere with French business interests. As France was looking to acquire Yunnan and Tonkin, when in 1873, a French merchant-adventurer named Jean Dupuis was intercepted by local Hanoi authority, the French Cochinchina government responded by sending out a new attack without talking with the Hue court. A French army led by Francis Garnier arrived at Tonkin in November. Because local administrators had allied with the Black Flags and mistrusted of Hanoi governor Nguyễn Tri Phương, in late November the French and Lê loyalists opened fire at the Vietnamese citadel of Hanoi. Tự Đức immediately sent delegations to negotiate with Garnier, but Prince Hoàng Kế Viêm, governor of Sơn Tây, had enlisted the Chinese Black Flags militia of Liu Yongfu to attack the French. Garnier was killed on 21 December by the Black Flag soldiers at the . A peace negotiation between Vietnam and France was reached on 5 January 1874. France formally recognized Vietnam&#x27;s full independence from China; France would pay off Vietnam&#x27;s Spanish debts; French force returned Hanoi to the Vietnamese; the Vietnamese military in Hanoi had to disband and be reduced to a simple police force; total religious and trade freedom was ensured; Vietnam was compelled to recognise all six southern provinces as French territories.

==== End of independence (1874–1885) ====
Just two years after French recognition, Tự Đức sent an embassy to Qing China in 1876 and re-provoked the tributary relationship with the Chinese (the last mission was in 1849). In 1878, Vietnam renewed relations with Thailand. In 1880, Britain, Germany, and Spain were still debating the fate of Vietnam, and the Chinese Embassy in Paris openly rejected the 1874 Franco-Vietnamese agreement. In Paris, Prime Minister Jules Ferry proposed a direct military campaign against Vietnam to revise the 1874 treaty. Because Tự Đức was too preoccupied to keep the French out of his Empire without directly engaging against them, he requested assistance from the Chinese court. In 1882, 30,000 Qing troops flooded into the northern provinces and occupied cities. The Black Flags had also been returning, together, collaborating with local Vietnamese officials and harassing French businesses. In March, the French responded by sending a second expedition led by Henri Rivière to the north to deal with these various problems but had to avoid all international attention, particularly from China. On 25 April 1882, Rivière took Hanoi without facing any resistance. Tự Đức informed the Chinese court that their tributary state was being attacked. In September 1882, 17 Chinese divisions (200,000 men) crossed the Sino-Vietnamese borders and occupied Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng, Bac Ninh, and Thái Nguyên, under the pretext of defending against the French aggression.

Backed by the Chinese army and prince Hoàng Kế Viêm, Liu Yongfu, and the Black Flags decided to attack Rivière. On 19 May 1883, the Black Flags ambushed and beheaded Rivière at the Second Battle of Cầu Giấy. When news of Rivière&#x27;s death reached France, there was immediate outcry and demands for a response. The French Parliament quickly voted for the conquest of Vietnam. Tens of thousands of French and Chinese reinforcements poured into the Red River Delta.

Tự Đức died on 17 July. Succession trouble temporarily paralyzed the court. One of his nephews Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Ái was crowned as Emperor Dục Đức but was, however, imprisoned and executed after three days by the three powerful regents Nguyễn Văn Tường, Tôn Thất Thuyết and Tran Tien Thanh for unknown reasons. Tự Đức&#x27;s brother Nguyễn Phúc Hồng Dật succeeded on 30 July as Emperor Hiệp Hòa. The senior Censorate official of the court Phan Đình Phùng denounced the three regents for their irregular handling of Tự Đức&#x27;s succession. Tôn Thất Thuyết excoriated Phan Đình Phùng and sent him from the court to his home territory, where later he led a nationalist resistance movement against the French for ten years.

To knock Vietnam out of the war, France decided to take a direct assault on the city of Huế. The French army split up itself into two parts: the smaller under General Bouët stayed in Hanoi and waited for reinforcement from France while the French fleet led by Amédée Courbet and Jules Harmand sailed to Thuận An, the sea gate of Hue on 17 August. Harmand demanded the two regents Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết surrender Northern Vietnam, North-Central Vietnam (Thanh Hoá, Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh) and Bình Thuận Province to French possession, and to accept a French résident in Huế who could demand imperial audiences. He sent an ultimatum to the regents that &quot;The name Vietnam will no longer exist in history&quot; if they did not comply with this.

On 18 August, French battleships began shelling Vietnamese positions in the Thuận An citadel. Two days later, at dawn, Courbet and the French marines landed on the shore. By the next morning, all Vietnamese defenses in Huế were overwhelmed by the French. Emperor Hiệp Hòa dispatched mandarin Nguyễn Thượng Bắc to negotiate.

On 25 September, two court officials, Trần Đình Túc and Nguyễn Trọng Hợp signed a twenty-seven-article treaty known as Harmand Convention. The French were granted Bình Thuận; Đà Nẵng and Qui Nhơn were opened for trade; the ruling sphere of the Vietnamese monarchy was reduced to Central Vietnam while Northern Vietnam became a French Protectorate. In November, Emperor Hiệp Hòa and Trần Tiễn Thành were executed by Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết for their perceived pro-French sympathies. 14-year-old Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Đăng was crowned as Emperor Kiến Phúc. After achieving peace with China through the Tientsin Accord in May 1884, on 6 June the French Ambassador in China Jules Patenôtre des Noyers signed with Nguyen Van Tuong the Protectorate Treaty of Patenôtre, which confirmed French dominion over Vietnam. On 31 May 1885, France appointed the first governor of all Vietnam. On 9 June 1885, Vietnam ceased to exist after 83 years as an independent state. The leader of the pro-war faction, Tôn Thất Thuyết and his supporters revolted against the French in July 1885, but were forced to retreat to the Laotian highlands with the young emperor Hàm Nghi (Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Lịch.) Meanwhile the French installed his pro-French brother Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Kỷ as emperor Đồng Khánh. Thuyết called up the nobility, loyalists and nationalists to arm for the resistance against the French occupation (Cần Vương movement). The movement lasted for 11 years (1885–1896) and Thuyết was forced to exile in China in 1888.

=== French protectorates of Annam and Tonkin (1883–1945) ===
The 1883 Treaty of Huế led to the rest of Vietnam becoming French protectorates, divided into the Protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The terms were, however, considered overly harsh in French diplomatic circles and never ratified in France. The following 1884 Treaty of Huế provided a softened version of the previous treaty. The 1885 Treaty of Tientsin, which reaffirmed the 1884 Tientsin Accord and ended the Sino-French War, confirmed Vietnam&#x27;s status as French protectorates and severed Vietnam&#x27;s tributary relationship with the Qing dynasty by requiring that all of Vietnam&#x27;s foreign affairs be conducted through France.

After this the Nguyễn dynasty only nominally ruled the two French protectorates. Annam and Tonkin were combined with Cochinchina and the neighboring Cambodian protectorate in 1887 to form the Union of French Indochina, of which they became administrative components.

French rule also reinforced ingredients that the Portuguese had already added to Vietnam&#x27;s cultural stew: Catholicism and a Latin-based alphabet. The spelling used in the Vietnamese transliteration is in fact Portuguese-based, because the French relied on a dictionary compiled earlier by a Portuguese cleric, Francisco de Pina. Due to their presence in Macau, the Portuguese were also the ones who brought Catholicism to Vietnam in the XVI Century, although it was the French who built most of the churches and established missions in the country.

==== World War I ====

While seeking to maximize the use of Indochina&#x27;s natural resources and manpower to fight World War I, France cracked down on Vietnam&#x27;s patriotic mass movements. Indochina (mainly Vietnam) had to provide France with 70,000 soldiers and 70,000 workers, who were forcibly drafted from villages to serve on the French battlefront. Vietnam also contributed 184 million piastres in loans and 336,000 tons of food.

These burdens proved heavy since agriculture experienced natural disasters from 1914 to 1917. Lacking a unified nationwide organization, the vigorous Vietnamese national movement failed to use the difficulties France had as a result of the war to stage significant uprisings.

In May 1916, sixteen-year-old emperor Duy Tân escaped from his palace to participate in an uprising of Vietnamese troops. The French were informed of the plan, and its leaders were arrested and executed. Duy Tân was deposed and exiled to the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

==== World War II ====

Nationalist sentiment intensified in Vietnam (especially during and after the First World War), but uprisings and tentative efforts failed to obtain concessions from the French. The Russian Revolution greatly impacted 20th-century Vietnamese history.

For Vietnam, the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939 was as decisive as the 1858 French seizure of Đà Nẵng. The Axis power of Japan invaded Vietnam on 22 September 1940, attempting to construct military bases to strike against Allied forces in Southeast Asia. This led to a period of Indochina under Japanese occupation with the cooperation of the collaborationist Vichy French, who still retained the administration of the colony. During this time the Viet Minh, a communist resistance movement, developed under Ho Chi Minh from 1941, with allied support. During 1944–1945 famine in northern Vietnam, over one million people starved to death.

=== Empire of Vietnam (1945) ===
In March 1945, after the liberation of France and heavy setbacks in the war, the Japanese in a last ditch effort to gather support in Indochina overthrew the French administration, imprisoned their civil servants and proclaimed independence for Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, which became the Empire of Vietnam with Bảo Đại as its Emperor. The Empire of Vietnam was a puppet state of the Empire of Japan. After the Surrender of Japan, Bảo Đại abdicated on 25 August 1945 after the Viet Minh launched the August Revolution.

This ended the 143-year reign of the Nguyễn dynasty.

== National administration ==
=== Government ===
==== Emperor ====

The Nguyễn dynasty retained the bureaucratic and hierarchic system of previous dynasties. The emperor was the head of state who wielded absolute authority. Under the emperor was the Ministry of Interior (which worked on papers, imperial messages and recording) and four Grand Secretariats (), later renamed the Ministry of Secret Council.

The Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty was an absolutist ruler, which means he was both the head of state and the head of government. The Gia Long Code in 1812 declared the Vietnamese monarch as the universal ruler of all Vietnam; using the Confucian concept Mandate of Heaven to provide monarchs absolute power. Their reign and popular images were judged based on how prosperous the livelihood (民生, &quot;dân sinh&quot;) of the people and the Confucian concept of &quot;chính danh&quot; (rectification of names), according to the Confucian biblical Analects, everything has to stay in its right order. Gia Long also perceived the ancient Chinese conception of Hua-Yi and in 1805 he confessed his Empire as &quot;Trung Quốc&quot; (中國, &quot;the Middle Kingdom&quot;), the Vietnamese term which often refers to China but now was taken by Gia Long to emphasis his Son of Heaven status and the devaluation of China. Following next decades, Confucianism and the Mandate of Heaven theory gradually lost their positions among the Vietnamese officials and intellectuals. When the fourth emperor, Tự Đức, ceded Southern Vietnam to France and called all Southern officials to give up arms, many ignored, disobeyed the Son of Heaven and continued to fight against invaders. Many dissents viewed him as surrendering and frightened of France. Rebellions against Tự Đức erupted every year from 1860 until he died in 1883.

A dual theory of sovereignty existed in Vietnam. All the Nguyễn monarchs were addressed as &quot;hoàng đế&quot; (黃帝, Sino-Vietnamese title for &quot;Emperor&quot;) in the court while referring himself the first person honorific &quot;trẫm&quot; (he who give the order). They also used the concept of &quot;thiên tử&quot; (天子, &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, which is borrowed from China) to demonstrate that the ruler was descended and commissioned by heaven to rule the kingdom. However, in most cases, Nguyen rulers were formally called &quot;vua&quot; (𪼀, the Vietnamese title for &quot;monarch&quot; or &quot; sovereign ruler&quot;) by the ordinary Vietnamese folks. The concept of a divine Son of Heaven has not been dogmatically practiced, and the monarch&#x27;s divinity was not absolute due to the dual theory. For example, Xu Jiyu, a Chinese geographer, reported that the bureaucrats in the Vietnamese court sat down and even felt free to search themselves for body lice during the court audiences. Gia Long once told the son of J.B. Chaigneau, one of his advisors, that the use of Son of Heaven in Vietnam was an &quot;absurdity&quot; and &quot;at least in mixed Vietnamese–European Company.&quot; Once the young crown prince is chosen to succeed, his obligation is to be filial with parents, be well-educated in politics and classics, and internalize the morals and ethics of a ruler.

After the 1884 Treaty of Huế was signed, the Nguyễn dynasty became two protectorates of France and the French installed their own administrators. Although the Emperors of the Nguyễn dynasty were still nominally in control of the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin, the Resident-Superior of Annam gradually gained more influence over the imperial court in Huế. In 1897 the Resident-Superior was granted the power to appoint the Nguyễn dynasty Emperors and presided over the meetings of the Viện cơ mật. These moves incorporated French officials directly into the administrative structure of the Imperial Huế Court and further legitimized French rule in the legislative branch of the Nguyễn government. From this period onwards any imperial edicts issued by the Emperors of Đại Nam had to be confirmed by the Resident-Superior of Annam giving him both legislative and executive power over the Nguyễn government.

In the year 1898, the federal government of French Indochina took over the financial and property management duties of the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s imperial court meaning that the Nguyễn dynasty Emperor (at the time Thành Thái) became a salaried employee of the Indochinese colonial structure, reducing their power to being only a civil servant of the Protectorate government. The Resident-Superior of Annam also took over the management of provincial mandarins and was a member of the Supreme Council (&quot;Conseil supérieur&quot;) of the Government-General of French Indochina.

==== Civil service and bureaucracy ====


=== Taxes ===
Vietnam&#x27;s monetary subunit was the quan (貫). One quan equaled 10 coins, equivalent to ₫600. In 1839, Emperor Minh Mạng determined that officials received the following taxes ():
* First senior rank (&quot;Chánh nhất phẩm&quot;): 400 quan; rice: 300 kg; per-capita tax: 70 quan
* First junior rank (&quot;Tòng nhất phẩm&quot;): 300 quan; rice: 250 kg; tax: 60 quan
* Second senior rank (&quot;Chánh nhị phẩm&quot;): 250 quan; rice: 200 kg; tax: 50 quan
* Second junior rank (&quot;Tòng nhị phẩm&quot;): 180 quan; rice: 150 kg; tax: 30 quan
* Third senior rank (&quot;Chánh tam phẩm&quot;): 150 quan; rice: 120 kg; tax: 20 quan
* Third junior rank (&quot;Tòng tam phẩm&quot;): 120 quan; rice: 90 kg; tax: 16 quan
* Fourth senior rank (&quot;Chánh tứ phẩm&quot;): 80 quan; rice: 60 kg; tax: 14 quan
* Fourth junior rank (&quot;Tòng tứ phẩm&quot;): 60 quan; rice: 50 kg; tax: 10 quan
* Fifth senior rank (&quot;Chánh ngũ phẩm&quot;): 40 quan; rice: 43 kg; tax: 9 quan
* Fifth junior rank (&quot;Tòng ngũ phẩm&quot;): 35 quan; rice: 30 kg; tax: 8 quan
* Sixth senior rank (&quot;Chánh lục phẩm&quot;): 30 quan; rice: 25 kg; tax: 7 quan
* Sixth junior rank (&quot;Tòng lục phẩm&quot;): 30 quan; rice: 22 kg; tax: 6 quan
* Seventh senior rank (&quot;Chánh thất phẩm&quot;): 25 quan; rice: 20 kg; tax: 5 quan
* Seventh junior rank (&quot;Tòng thất phẩm&quot;): 22 quan; rice: 20 kg; tax: 5 quan
* Eighth senior rank (&quot;Chánh bát phẩm&quot;): 20 quan; rice: 18 kg; tax: 5 quan
* Eighth junior rank (&quot;Tòng bát phẩm&quot;): 20 quan; rice: 18 kg; tax: 4 quan
* Ninth senior rank (&quot;Chánh cửu phẩm&quot;): 18 quan; rice: 16 kg; tax: 4 quan
* Ninth junior rank (&quot;Tòng cửu phẩm&quot;): 18 quan; rice: 16 kg; tax: 4 quan

Officials from the first to third ranks received taxes twice a year, while those from the fourth to seventh ranks received taxes at the end of the four seasons. The eighth and ninth-ranked officials did so every month in a year. The Emperor also granted an annual &quot;dưỡng liêm&quot; money to prevent corruption among regional administrators.

When mandarins retired, they could receive one hundred to four hundred quan from the emperor. When they died, the imperial court provided twenty to two hundred quan for a funeral.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Under Gia Long ===

During the reign of Gia Long, the kingdom was divided into twenty-three quasi-militant protectorates &quot;trấn&quot; and four military departments &quot;doanh.&quot; Each protectorate, besides having their own separated regional governments, was under patrol of one greater, powerful unit called Overlord of Citadel, or the Viceroy. For examples, the northern protectorates had &quot;Bắc thành Tổng trấn&quot; (Viceroy of Northern Protectorates) in Hanoi, and southern protectorates had &quot;Gia Định thành Tổng trấn&quot; (Viceroy of Gia Định Protectorates) resides in Saigon. Two famously viceroys during Gia Long&#x27;s reign were Nguyễn Văn Thành (Hanoi) and Lê Văn Duyệt (Saigon). By 1802, these were:
* 16 protectorates under joint-governance from the Viceroys.

# Sơn Nam Thượng (Hanoi)
# Sơn Nam Hạ (Nam Định)
# Sơn Tây
# Kinh Bắc (Bắc Ninh)
# Hải Dương
# Tuyên Quang
# Hưng Hoá
# Cao Bằng
# Lạng Sơn
# Thái Nguyên
# Quảng Yên
# Gia Định or Phiên An
# Biên Hoà
# Vĩnh Thanh (later became Vĩnh Long and An Giang
# Định Tường (Tiền Giang)
# Hà Tiên

* 7 Central protectorates

# Thanh Hoá
# Nghệ An
# Quảng Nghĩa (Quảng Ngãi)
# Bình Định
# Phú Yên
# Bình Hoà (Khánh Hoà)
# Bình Thuận

* 4 departments surrounding Huế, directly ruled by Gia Long.
# Quảng Đức
# Quảng Bình
# Quảng Trị
# Quảng Nam

=== Minh Mạng and later ===

In 1831, Minh Mạng reorganised his kingdom by converting all these protectorates into 31 provinces (&quot;tỉnh&quot;). Each province had a series of smaller jurisdictions: the prefecture (&quot;phủ&quot;), the subprefecture (&quot;châu&quot;, in areas whereas having a significant population of ethnic minorities). Under prefecture and subprefecture, there was the district (&quot;huyện&quot;), the canton (&quot;tổng&quot;). Under district and canton, the bundle of hamlets around one common religious temple or social factor point, the village &quot;(làng&quot; or the commune &quot;xã&quot;) was the lowest administrative unit, which one respected person nominally took care of village administrative, which called lý trưởng.

Two nearby provinces were combined into a pair. Every pair had a governor-general (&quot;Tổng đốc&quot;) and a governor (&quot;Tuần phủ&quot;). Frequently, there were twelve governor-generals and eleven governors, although, in some periods, the Emperor would appoint a &quot;commissioner in charge of patrolled borderlands&quot; (&quot;kinh lược sứ&quot;) that supervising entire northern of the southern part of the kingdom. In 1803, Vietnam had 57 prefectures, 41 subprefectures, 201 districts, 4,136 cantons and 16,452 villages, and then by the 1840s its had been increased to 72 prefectures, 39 subprefectures and 283 districts, which an average 30,000 people per district. Cambodia had been absorbed into the Vietnamese administrative system, bore the name Tây Thành Province from 1834 to 1845. With areas having minority groups like Tày, Nùng, Mèo (Hmong people), Mường, Mang and Jarai, the Huế court imposed the co-existing tributary and quasi-bureaucratic governance system, while allowing these people to have their own local rulers and autonomy.
In 1832, there were:
* Three regions and 31 provinces (encompassed modern-day Vietnam):

# Bắc Kỳ (Tonkin)
## Hanoi
## Lạng Sơn
## Cao Bằng
## Bắc Ninh
## Thái Nguyên
## Nam Định

=== Culture and cultural discrimination ===
The Nguyễn dynasty viewed cultures that were &quot;non-Chinese&quot; as barbaric and called themselves the Central Kingdom (Trung Quốc, 中國). This includes the Han Chinese under the Qing dynasty who were viewed as &quot;non-Chinese&quot;. As the Qing have caused the Chinese to not be &quot;Han&quot; anymore. Chinese were referred to as &quot;Thanh nhân&quot; (清人)&quot;.&quot; This occurred after Vietnam had sent a delegate to Beijing, whereupon a diplomatic disaster caused Vietnam to view other &quot;non-Chinese&quot; as barbaric in much the same way as the Qing. By the Nguyễn dynasty the Vietnamese themselves were ordering Cambodian Khmer to adopt Vietnamese culture by ceasing &quot;barbarous&quot; habits like cropping hair and ordering them to grow it long besides making them replace skirts with trousers. Han Chinese Ming dynasty refugees numbering 3,000 came to Vietnam at the end of the Ming dynasty. They opposed the Qing dynasty and were fiercely loyal to the Ming dynasty. Vietnamese women married these Han Chinese refugees since most of them were soldiers and single men. They did not wear Manchu hairstyle unlike later Chinese migrants to Vietnam during the Qing dynasty.

=== Vietnamisation of ethnic minorities ===
Under emperor Minh Mạng sinicisation of ethnic minorities became state policy. He claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China&#x27;s Han dynasty for Vietnam, and used the term &quot;Han people&quot; (漢人, &quot;Hán nhân&quot;) to refer to the Vietnamese. According to the emperor, &quot;We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.&quot; These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes. Nguyễn Phúc Chu had referred to the Vietnamese as &quot;Han people&quot; in 1712, distinguishing them from the Chams. The Nguyễn lords established colonies after 1790. Gia Long said, &quot;Hán di hữu hạn&quot; (漢 夷 有 限, &quot;The Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders&quot;), distinguishing the Khmer from the Vietnamese. Minh Mang implemented an acculturation policy for minority non-Vietnamese peoples. &quot;Thanh nhân&quot; (清 人 referring to the Qing dynasty) or &quot;Đường nhân&quot; (唐人 referring to the Tang dynasty) were used to refer to ethnic Chinese by the Vietnamese, who called themselves &quot;Hán dân&quot; (漢 民) and &quot;Hán nhân&quot; (漢人 referring to the Han dynasty) during 19th-century Nguyễn rule. Since 1827, descendants of Ming dynasty refugees were called &quot;Minh nhân&quot; (明人) or &quot;Minh Hương&quot; (明 鄉) by Nguyễn rulers, to distinguish with ethnic Chinese. &quot;Minh nhân&quot; were treated as Vietnamese since 1829. They were not allowed to go to China, and also not allowed to wear the Manchu queue.

=== Costume ===

The Nguyễn dynasty popularized Qing-influenced clothing. Trousers were adopted by female White H&#x27;mong speakers, replacing their traditional skirts. The Qing-influenced tunics and trousers were worn by the Vietnamese. The &quot;áo dài&quot; was developed in the 1920s, when compact, close-fitting tucks were added to predecessor of the áo dài, áo ngũ thân. Chinese-influenced trousers and tunics were ordered by lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát during the 18th century, replacing traditional Vietnamese áo tràng vạt derived from Chinese &quot;jiaoling youren&quot; (Chinese: 交領右衽). Although the Chinese-influenced trousers and tunic were mandated by the Nguyen government, skirts were worn in isolated north Vietnamese hamlets until the 1920s. Chinese style clothing was ordered for the Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by Nguyễn Phúc Khoát.

An 1841 polemic, &quot;On Distinguishing Barbarians&quot;, was based on the Qing sign &quot;Vietnamese Barbarians&#x27; Hostel&quot; (越夷會館) on the Fujian residence of Nguyen diplomat and Hoa Chinese Lý Văn Phức. It argued that the Qing did not subscribe to the neo-Confucianist texts from the Song and Ming dynasties which were learned by the Vietnamese, who saw themselves as sharing a civilization with the Qing. This event triggered a diplomatic disaster. The consequence was that non-&quot;Han Chinese highland tribes&quot; and other non-Vietnamese peoples living near (or in) Vietnam were called &quot;barbarian&quot; by the Vietnamese imperial court. The essay distinguishes the Yi and Hua, and mentions Zhao Tuo, Wen, Shun and Taibo. Kelley and Woodside described Vietnam&#x27;s Confucianism.

Emperors Minh Mạng, Thiệu Trị and Tự Đức, were opposed to French involvement in Vietnam, and tried to reduce the country&#x27;s growing Catholic community. The imprisonment of missionaries who had illegally entered the country was the primary pretext for the French to invade (and occupy) Indochina. Like Qing China, a number of incidents involved other European nations during the 19th century.

=== Religion ===
Although the previous Nguyễn lords were faithful Buddhists, Gia Long was not a Buddhist. He adopted Neo-Confucianism and actively restricted Buddhism. Scholars, elites, and officials attacked Buddhist doctrines and criticized them as superstitious and useless. The third emperor, Thiệu Trị, elevated Confucianism as the true religion and while regarding Buddhism as superstition.

Building new Buddhist pagodas and temples were forbidden. Buddhist clergies and nuns were forced to join public works to limit the influence of Buddhism and promote Confucianism as the sole dominant belief of the society. However, such embracing a Sinic Confucian culture among the Vietnamese populace whom lived amidst a Southeast Asian infrastructure, widening the distance between the population and the court far away. Buddhism was still prevalent in mainstream society and had its presence within the imperial palace. Empress mothers, queens, princess, and concubines were devout Buddhists, despite the patriarchal prohibition.
Confucianism itself was the ideology of the Nguyen court, also provided the basic core of classical education and civil examination every year. Gia Long pursued Confucianism to create and maintain a conservative society and social structures. Confucian rituals and ideas were circulations based within ancient Confucian teaching such as The Analects and Spring and Autumn Annals in Vietnamese-script collections. The court rigidly imported these Chinese books from Chinese merchants. Confucian rituals such as &quot;cầu đảo&quot; (offering heaven for wind and rain during a drought) that the emperor and court officials perform for wishing heaven to rain down his kingdom. If the offer went successful, they had to conduct &quot;lễ tạ&quot; (thanksgiving ritual) to heaven. In addition, the emperor believed that holy spirits and natural goddesses of his country can also make rain. In 1804, Gia Long built the Nam Hải Long Vương Temple (Temple of Southern Ocean Dragon King) in Thuận An, northeast of Hue in his faithfulness to the god of Thuận An (&quot;Thần Thuận An&quot;), the place where most of &quot;cầu đảo&quot; ritual was performed. His successor, Minh Mạng, continued to build several temples dedicated to the &quot;Vũ Sư&quot; (Rainmaking god) and altars for &quot;Thần Mây&quot; (Cloud God) and &quot;Thần Sấm&quot; (Thunder God). Nguyễn Trường Tộ, a prominent Catholic and reformist intellectual, launched an attack on Confucian structures in 1867 as decadent. He wrote to Tự Đức: &quot;the evil that has been brought on China and on our country by the Confucian way of life.&quot; He criticized the court&#x27;s Confucian education as dogmatic and unrealistic, promoted for his education reform.

During Gia Long&#x27;s years, Catholicism was peacefully worshipped without any restriction. Began with Minh Mạng, who considered Christianity as a heterodox religion for its rejection of ancestor worship, the important belief of the Vietnamese monarchy. After reading the Bible (Old and New Testament), he considered the Christianity religion irrational and ridiculous, and praised Tokugawa Japan for its notorious policies on Christians. Minh Mạng also was influenced by anti-Christian propaganda written by Vietnamese Confucian officials and literati, which described the mixing of men and women and liberal society among the Church. The most thing he worried about Christianity and Catholicism was writing texts that proved that Christianity was a means for Europeans to take over foreign countries. He also praised the anti-Christian policy in Japan. Churches were destroyed and many Christians were imprisoned. The persecution got intense during the reign of his grandson Tự Đức, when most of the state efforts were to annihilate Vietnamese Christianity. Unironically, even during the height of the anti-Catholic campaign, many Catholic scholars were still permitted to hold high positions in the imperial court.

After an imperial edict in late 1862, Catholicism was officially recognized and worshipers of the faith obtained state protection. It is estimated that late-19th century Vietnam had about 600,000 to 700,000 Catholic Christians.

=== Demography ===
Before the French conquest, the Vietnamese population was very sparse due to the agricultural backbones economy of the country. The population in 1802 was 6.5 million people and had only grown to 8 million by 1840. Rapid industrialization after the 1860s ushered in massive population growth and rapid urbanization in the late 19th century. Many peasants left tenant farms and poured into cities, they were hired by French-owned factories. By 1880 the Vietnamese were estimated back then as high as 18 million people, while modern estimates by Angus Maddison have suggested a lower figure of 12.2 million people. Vietnam under the Nguyễn dynasty was always a multiethnic complex. Nearly 80% percent of the Empire&#x27;s population were ethnic Vietnamese (called Annamites then), whom language belonged to the Mon-Khmer (Mon–Annamite then) family, and the rest were Cham, Chinese, Khmer, Mường, Tày (called Thô then), and other 50 ethnic minorities such as the Mang, Jarai, Yao.

The Annamites are distributed across the lowland of the country from Tonkin to Cochichina. The Chams live in central Vietnam and the Mekong Delta. The Chinese particularly concentrated in urbanised areas such as Saigon, Chợ Lớn, and Hanoi. The Chinese tended to be divided into two groups called &quot;Minh Hương&quot; (明鄉) and &quot;Thanh nhân&quot; (清人). The Minh Hương were Chinese refugees that had migrated and settled down in Vietnam earlier during the 17th century, who married with Vietnamese women, had been substantially assimilated to local Vietnamese and Khmer populaces, and loyal to the Nguyen, compared to the Thanh nhân that recently arrived in Southern Vietnam, dominated the rice trade. During the reign of Minh Mạng, a restriction against the Thanh nhân was issued in 1827, Thanh nhân could not access to the state bureaucracy and had to be integrated into Vietnamese population like the Minh Hương.

The Mường people inhabited the hills west of the Red River Delta, and although subordinate to the central authority, they were permitted to bear arms, a privilege not accorded to any other subjects of the court of Huế. The Tày and the Mang live in the northern highlands of Tonkin, both submitted to Huế court along with taxes and tribute, but were allowed to have their hereditary chiefs.

=== Photography ===

The first photographs of Vietnam were taken by Jules Itier in Danang, in 1845. The first photos of the Vietnamese were taken by Fedor Jagor in November 1857 in Singapore. Due to the forbidden contact to foreigners, photography returned to Vietnam again during the French conquest and had shots taken by Paul Berranger during the French invasion of Da Nang (September 1858). Since the French seizure of Saigon in 1859, the city and southern Vietnam had been opening to foreigners, and photography entered Vietnam exclusively from France and Europe.

== Imperial family ==


The House of Nguyễn Phúc (Nguyen Gia Mieu) had historically been founded in the 14th century in Gia Miêu village, Thanh Hóa Province, before they came to rule southern Vietnam from 1558 to 1777 and 1780 to 1802, then became the ruling dynasty of the entire Vietnam. Traditionally, the family traces themselves to Nguyễn Bặc (924–79), a duke and general during the Đinh dynasty from Gia Viễn, Ninh Bình. Princes and male descendants of Gia Long are called Hoàng Thân, while male lineal descendants of previous Nguyen lords are named Tôn Thất. Grandsons of the emperor were Hoàng tôn. Daughters of the emperor were called Hoàng nữ, and always earned the title công chúa (princess).

Their succession practically is according to the law of primogeniture, but sometimes conflicted. The first succession conflict arose in 1816 when Gia Long was designing for an heir. His first prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh died in 1802. As a result, two rival factions emerged, one support Nguyễn Phúc Mỹ Đường, the eldest son of Prince Cảnh, as the crown prince, while other support Prince Đảm (later Minh Mang). The second conflict was the 1847 succession when two young princes Nguyễn Phúc Hồng Bảo and Hồng Nhậm were dragged by the ill-failing Emperor Thiệu Trị as a potential heir. At first, Thiệu Trị apparently chose Prince Hồng Bảo because he was older, but after hearing advice from two regents Trương Đăng Quế and Nguyễn Tri Phương, he revised the heir at last minute and choose Hồng Nhậm as the crown prince.

=== Emperors ===

The following list is the emperors&#x27; era names, which have meaning in Chinese and Vietnamese. For example, the first ruler&#x27;s era name, Gia Long, is the combination of the old names for Saigon (Gia Định) and Hanoi (Thăng Long) to show the new unity of the country; the fourth, Tự Đức, means &quot;Inheritance of Virtues&quot;; the ninth, Đồng Khánh, means &quot;Collective Celebration&quot;.
After the death of Emperor Tự Đức (and according to his will), Dục Đức ascended to the throne on 19 July 1883. He was dethroned and imprisoned three days later, after being accused of deleting a paragraph from Tự Đức&#x27;s will. With no time to announce his dynastic title, his era name was named for his residential palace.

=== Flags ===
The Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s national flag or the Imperial flag first appeared during the reign of Gia Long. It was a yellow flag with a single or three horizontal red stripes, sometimes in 1822, it was entirely blank yellow or white. The emperor&#x27;s personal flag was a golden dragon spitting fire, surrounded by clouds, a silver moon, and a black crescent on a yellow background.

=== Seals ===
The Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s seal are rich and diverse in types and had strict rules and laws that regulated their manipulation, management, and use. The common practice of using seals was clearly recorded in the book &quot;Khâm định Đại Nam hội điển sự lệ&quot; on how to use seals, how to place them, and on what kinds of documents, which was compiled by the Cabinet of the Nguyễn dynasty in the year Minh Mạng 3 (1822). The various types of seals of the Nguyễn dynasty had different names based on their function, namely Bảo (寶), Tỷ (璽), Ấn (印), Chương (章), Ấn chương (印章), Kim bảo tỷ (金寶璽), Quan phòng (關防), Đồ ký (圖記), Kiềm ký (鈐記), Tín ký (信記), Ấn Ký (印記), Trưởng ký (長記), and Ký (記).

Seals in the Nguyễn dynasty were overseen by a pair of agencies referred to as the Office of Ministry Seals Management – Officers on Duty (印司 – 直處, &quot;Ấn ty – Trực xứ&quot;), this is a term that refers to two agencies which were established within each of the Six Ministries, these agencies were tasked with keeping track of the seals, files, and chapters of their ministry. On duty of the Office of Ministry Seals Management were the correspondents of each individual ministry that received and distributed documents and records of a government agency. These two agencies usually had a few dozen officers who would import documents from their ministry. Usually the name of the ministry is directly attached to the seal agency&#x27;s name, for example &quot;Office of Civil Affairs Ministry Seals Management – Civil Affairs Ministry Officers on Duty&quot; (吏印司吏直處, &quot;Lại Ấn ty Lại Trực xứ&quot;).

Since the Nguyễn dynasty period seals have a fairly uniform shape (with or without a handle), the uniform description of these seals in Vietnamese are:
* &quot;Thân ấn&quot; – The geometric block, or body, of the seal.
* &quot;Núm ấn&quot; – The handle for pressing the seal down on texts. In case the seal is shaped like a pyramid, there is no knob.
* &quot;Mặt ấn&quot; – Where the main content of the seal (symbol or word) is engraved, this area is usually in the face down position. The stamp surface is often used up to engrave letters or drawings.
* &quot;Lưng ấn&quot; – The face of the seal, where other information about the seal is engraved, usually in the supine position. In the case of the flat-head pyramid seal (&quot;ấn triện hình tháp đầu bằng&quot;), the flat head is the back.
* &quot;Hình ấn&quot; – A word used to indicate the impression of the seal on a text.

Seals were also given to people after they received a noble title. For example, after Léon Louis Sogny received the title of &quot;Baron of An Bình&quot; (安平男) in the year Bảo Đại 14 (保大拾肆年, 1939) he was also given a golden seal and a&quot; Kim Bài&quot; (金牌) with his noble title on it. The seal had the seal script inscription &quot;An Bình Nam chi ấn&quot; (安平男之印).

In its 143 years of existence, the government of the Nguyễn dynasty had created more than 100 imperial seals. These imperial seals were made of jade, bronze, silver, gold, ivory, and meteorite.

=== Sun, moon, auspicious clouds, and the Yin-Yang symbol ===
Like Imperial China and Royal Korea, the Vietnamese used the sun as the &quot;Symbol of the Empire&quot; and auspicious clouds and the Taijitu as &quot;Symbols of the State&quot;. The heraldic systems of both the Later Lê and Nguyễn dynasties were similar to those found in China during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The sun symbol as a flaming disc in Vietnam dates back to the 11th century and during the Nguyễn dynasty period this symbol was often depicted with pointed rays. The moon symbolised the state, the sun the empire, stars the sovereigns, and clouds the heaven.

The &quot;Achievement of the Empire&quot; and the &quot;Achievement of the State&quot; were identical to their Imperial Chinese counterparts, the &quot;Achievement of the Empire&quot; first appeared in Vietnam during the 11th century and were identical during the Later Lê and Nguyễn periods consisting of two Dragons surrounding a flaming sun, while the &quot;Achievement of the State&quot; is known to have been used as early as the Trần dynasty period and this early Trần version consists of two Dragons surrounding a lotus flower (a symbol of Buddhism). During the Nguyễn dynasty period the &quot;Achievement of the State&quot; typically consisted of two dragons surrounding a moon or two dragons surrounding a Taijitu, this symbol was commonly found on the caps of high-ranking mandarins. The two dragons surrounding the moon implies that the emperor, or &quot;sovereign&quot;, (represented by the dragons) was also the head of state (represented by either the moon or a Yin-Yang symbol). During the period of French domination (法屬, &quot;Pháp thuộc&quot;) these symbols could be interpreted as the French National Assembly (that is: the French people) was the sovereign over the Empire (the dragons), the Nguyễn Emperor now merely being the head of state (moon or Yin-Yang symbol). Moons also appeared on the shields of common Nguyễn dynasty soldiers representing the state, while soldiers of the imperial guards sometimes had shields depicting a red sun showcasing that they were a function of the empire.

=== Dragons ===
Dragon motifs appeared on many state symbols during the Nguyễn dynasty period including on imperial edicts, coins, buildings, and the badges of the Imperial Guard. During the Minh Mạng period (1820–1841) dragons on silver Tiền coins were often depicted facing dexter (to the right), while during the Thiệu Trị period (1841–1847) and later these coins depicted dragons guardant (facing forward). Dragons were considered to be one of the four sacred animals together with the Phượng hoàng (Phoenix), Kỳ lân (Unicorn), and the Linh quy (Sacred turtle). During the Nguyễn dynasty period the depiction of dragons in Vietnamese art reached their zenith and the quality and variety of Nguyễn dynasty dragons was much higher than those of earlier dynasties.

In the third month of the year &quot;Bính Tý&quot;, or Gia Long 15 (1816), Emperor Gia Long instructed the court to create special clothes, hats, and seals for himself and the crown prince to denote independence from China. These regalia all depicted five-clawed dragons (蠪𠄼𤔻, &quot;rồng 5 móng&quot;), in Chinese symbolism (including Vietnamese symbolism) five-clawed dragons are symbols of an Emperor, while four-clawed dragons are seen as symbols or kings. To denote the high status of Emperor all monarchial robes, hats, and seals were adorned with five-clawed dragons and ordered the creation of new seals with five-clawed dragons as their seal knobs to showcase imperial legitimacy. Meanwhile, the wardrobes and other symbols of vassals and princes were adorned with four-clawed dragons symbolising their status as &quot;kings&quot;.

The two national coats of arms of the French protectorate of Annam would also consist of golden dragons with one being a sword per fess charged with a scroll inscribed with two Traditional Chinese characters &quot;Đại Nam&quot; (大南) and supported by a single Vietnamese dragon and the other being a golden five-clawed dragon positioned affronté.

<text>Johns Hopkins (May 19, 1795 – December 24, 1873) was an American merchant, investor, and philanthropist. Born on a plantation, he left his home to start a career at the age of 17, and settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he remained for most of his life.

Hopkins invested heavily in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), which eventually led to his appointment as finance director of the company. He was also president of Baltimore-based Merchants&#x27; National Bank. Hopkins was a staunch supporter of Abraham Lincoln and the Union, often using his Maryland residence as a gathering place for Union strategists. He was a Quaker and supporter of the abolitionist cause.

Hopkins was a philanthropist his whole life. His philanthropic giving increased significantly after the Civil War. His concern for the poor and newly freed slave populations drove him to create free medical facilities, orphanages, asylums, and schools to help alleviate the impoverished conditions for all, regardless of race, sex, age, or religion, but especially focused on the young. Following his death, his bequests founded numerous institutions bearing his name, most notably Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins University system, including its academic divisions: Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. At the time, it was the largest philanthropic bequest ever made to an American educational institution.

==Early life and education==
Johns Hopkins was born on May 19, 1795, at his family&#x27;s home of White&#x27;s Hall, a tobacco plantation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. His first name was inherited from his grandfather Johns Hopkins, who received his first name from his mother Margaret Johns. He was one of eleven children born to Samuel Hopkins of Crofton, Maryland, and Hannah Janney, of Loudoun County, Virginia. 

The Hopkins family were of English and Welsh descent and Quakers. Hopkins&#x27; sister, Sarah Hopkins Janney became a prominent member, and eventually an elder, at Baltimore Quaker Meeting. They emancipated their slaves in 1778 in accordance with their Quaker meeting&#x27;s decree, which called for freeing the able-bodied and caring for the others, who would remain at the plantation and provide labor as they could. The second eldest of eleven children, Hopkins was required to work on the farm alongside his siblings and indentured and free Black laborers. From 1806 to 1809, he likely attended The Free School of Anne Arundel County, which was located in modern-day Davidsonville, Maryland.

In 1812, at the age of 17, Hopkins left the plantation to work in his uncle Gerard T. Hopkins&#x27;s Baltimore wholesale grocery business. Gerard T. Hopkins was an established merchant and clerk of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of Friends. While living with his uncle&#x27;s family, Johns and his cousin, Elizabeth, fell in love; however, the Quaker taboo against the marriage of first cousins was especially strong, and neither Johns nor Elizabeth ever married.

==Career==

Hopkins&#x27; early experiences and successes in business came when he was put in charge of the store while his uncle was away during the War of 1812. After seven years with his uncle, Hopkins went into business together with Benjamin Moore, a fellow Quaker. The business partnership was later dissolved with Moore alleging Hopkins&#x27; penchant for capital accumulation as the cause for the divide.

After Moore&#x27;s withdrawal, Hopkins partnered with three of his brothers and established Hopkins &amp; Brothers Wholesalers in 1819. The company prospered by selling various wares in the Shenandoah Valley from Conestoga wagons, sometimes in exchange for corn whiskey, which was then sold in Baltimore as &quot;Hopkins&#x27; Best&quot;. The bulk of Hopkins&#x27;s fortune, however, was made by his judicious investments in myriad ventures, most notably the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), of which he became a director in 1847 and chairman of the Finance Committee in 1855. He was also President of Merchants&#x27; Bank as well as director of a number of other organizations. After a successful career, Hopkins was able to retire at the age of 52 in 1847.

A charitable individual, Hopkins put up his own money more than once to not only aid Baltimore City during times of financial crises but also to twice bail the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company out of debt, in 1857 and 1873.

In 1996, Johns Hopkins ranked 69th in &quot;The Wealthy 100: From Benjamin Franklin to Bill Gates: A Ranking of the Richest Americans, Past and Present&quot;.

==Civil War==
One of the first campaigns of the American Civil War was planned at Hopkins&#x27; summer estate, Clifton, where he had also entertained a number of foreign dignitaries, including the future King Edward VII. Hopkins was a strong supporter of the Union, unlike some Marylanders, who sympathized with and often supported the South and the Confederacy. During the Civil War, Clifton became a frequent meeting place for local Union sympathizers, and federal officials.

Hopkins&#x27; support of Abraham Lincoln also often put him at odds with some of Maryland&#x27;s most prominent people, including Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney who continually opposed Lincoln&#x27;s presidential decisions such as limiting habeas corpus and stationing Union Army troops in Maryland. In 1862, Hopkins wrote a letter to Lincoln requesting that he not heed the detractors&#x27; calls and continue to keep soldiers stationed in Maryland. Hopkins also pledged financial and logistic support to Lincoln, in particular the free use of the B&amp;O railway system.

==Abolitionism==

In 2020, Johns Hopkins University researchers discovered that Johns Hopkins may have owned or employed enslaved people who worked in his home and on his country estate, citing census records from 1840 and 1850.

Hopkins&#x27; reputation as an abolitionist is currently disputed. In an email sent from Johns Hopkins University to all employees on December 9, 2020, the university wrote that, &quot;The current research done by Martha S. Jones and Allison Seyler finds no evidence to substantiate the description of Johns Hopkins as an abolitionist, and they have explored and brought to light a number of other relevant materials. They have been unable to document the story of Johns Hopkins&#x27; parents freeing enslaved people in 1807, but they have found a partial freeing of enslaved people in 1778 by Johns Hopkins&#x27; grandfather, and also continued slaveholding and transactions involving enslaved persons for decades thereafter. They have looked more closely at an 1838 letter from the Hopkins Brothers (a firm in which Johns Hopkins was a principal) in which an enslaved person is accepted as collateral for a debt owed, and recently located an additional obituary in which Johns Hopkins is described as holding antislavery political views (consistent with the letter conveying his established support for President Lincoln and the Union) and as purchasing an enslaved person for the purpose of securing his eventual freedom. Still other documents contain laudatory comments by Johns Hopkins&#x27; contemporaries, including prominent Black leaders, praising his visionary philanthropic support for the establishment of an orphanage for Black children.&quot;

A second group of scholars disputes the university&#x27;s December 2020 declarations. In a pre-print paper published by the Open Science Framework, these scholars argue that Johns Hopkins&#x27;s parents and grandparents were devout Quakers who liberated the family&#x27;s enslaved laborers prior to 1800, that Johns Hopkins was an emancipationist who supported the movement to end slavery within the limits of the laws governing Maryland, and that the available documentation, including relevant tax records these researchers have uncovered, does not support the university&#x27;s claim that Johns Hopkins was a slaveholder.

Before the discovery of possible slaveholding or employment, Johns Hopkins had been described as being an &quot;abolitionist before the word was even invented&quot;, having been represented as such both prior to the Civil War period, as well as during the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. Prior to the Civil War, Johns Hopkins worked closely with two of America&#x27;s most famous abolitionists, Myrtilla Miner and Henry Ward Beecher. During the Civil War, Johns Hopkins, being a staunch supporter of Lincoln and the Union, was instrumental in bringing fruition to Lincoln&#x27;s emancipatory vision.

After the Civil War and during Reconstruction, Johns Hopkins&#x27;s stance on abolitionism infuriated many prominent people in Baltimore. During Reconstruction and up to his death his abolitionism was expressed in the documents founding the Johns Hopkins Institutions and reported in newspaper articles before, during, and after the founding of these institutions. Before the war, there was significant written opposition to his support for Myrtilla Miner&#x27;s founding of a school for African American females (now the University of the District of Columbia). In a letter to the editor, one subscriber to the widely circulated De Bow&#x27;s Review wrote:

Similarly, opposition (and some support) was expressed during Reconstruction, such as in 1867, the same year he filed papers incorporating the Johns Hopkins Institutions, when he attempted unsuccessfully to stop the convening of the Maryland Constitutional Convention where the Democratic Party came into power and where a new state Constitution, the Constitution still in effect, was voted to replace the 1864 Constitution of the Republicans previously in power.

Apparent also in the literature of the times was opposition, and support for, the various other ways he expressed opposition to the racial practices that were beginning to emerge, and re-emerge as well, in the city of Baltimore, the state of Maryland, the nation, and in the posthumously constructed and founded institutions that would carry his name. A &quot;Baltimore American&quot; journalist praised Hopkins for founding three institutions, a university, a hospital, and an orphan asylum, specifically for colored children, adding that Hopkins was a &quot;man (beyond his times) who knew no race&quot; citing his provisions for both blacks and whites in the plans for his hospital. The reporter also pointed to similarities between Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s and Johns Hopkins&#x27;s views on hospital care and construction, such as their shared interest in free hospitals and the availability of emergency services without prejudice. This article, first published in 1870, also accompanied Hopkins&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Baltimore American&quot; as a tribute in 1873. Cited in many of the newspaper articles on him during his lifetime and immediately after his death were his provisions of scholarships for the poor, and quality health services for the under-served without regard to their age, sex, or color, the colored children asylum and other orphanages, and the mentally ill and convalescents.

A biography, &quot;Johns Hopkins: A Silhouette&quot;, was written by Hopkins&#x27; grandniece, Helen Hopkins Thom, and published in 1929 by Johns Hopkins University Press. This biography was one source for the story that Hopkins was an abolitionist.

==Philanthropy==
Hopkins lived his entire adult life in Baltimore and made many friends among the city&#x27;s social elite, many of them Quakers. One of these friends was George Peabody (b. 1795), who in 1857 founded the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. Examples of Hopkins&#x27; public giving were evident in Baltimore with public buildings, housing, free libraries, schools, and foundations constructed from his philanthropic giving. On the advice of Peabody, some believe, Hopkins determined to use his great wealth for the public good.

The Civil War and yellow fever and cholera epidemics took a great toll on Baltimore. In the summer of 1832 alone, the yellow fever and cholera epidemics killed 853 in Baltimore. Hopkins was keenly aware of the city&#x27;s need for medical facilities in light of the medical advances made during the Civil War. In 1870, he made a will setting aside $7 million, (~$ in ) mostly in B&amp;O stock, for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurses&#x27; training colleges, an orphanage for Black children, and a university in Baltimore. The hospital and orphan asylum were overseen by a 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by a 12-member university board of trustees. Many board members were on both boards. In accordance with Hopkins&#x27; will, the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum was founded in 1875; Johns Hopkins University was founded in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in the U.S., was founded in 1878; Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing were founded in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was founded in 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was founded in 1916.

Hopkins&#x27; views on his bequests, and on the duties and responsibilities of the two boards of trustees, especially the hospital board of trustees led by his friend and fellow Quaker Francis King, were formally stated primarily in four documents, the incorporation papers filed in 1867, his instruction letter to the hospital trustees dated March 12, 1873, his will, which was quoted extensively in his &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; obituary, and in his will&#x27;s two codicils, one dated 1870 and a second dated 1873.

In these documents, Hopkins made provisions for scholarships to be provided for poor youths in the states where he had made his wealth and assistance to orphanages other than the one established for African American children, to members of his family, to those he employed, his cousin Elizabeth, to other institutions for the care and education of youths regardless of color, and the care of the elderly and the ill, including the mentally ill and convalescents.

John Rudolph Niernsee, one of the most notable architects of the time, designed the orphan asylum and helped to design the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The original site for Johns Hopkins University had been personally selected by Hopkins. According to his will, it was to be located at his summer estate, Clifton. However, a decision was made not to found the university there. The property, now owned by the city of Baltimore, is the site of a golf course and a park named Clifton Park. While Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum was founded by the hospital trustees, the other institutions that carry the name of Johns Hopkins were founded under the administration of Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Gilman&#x27;s successors.

===Colored Children Orphan Asylum===
As stipulated in Hopkins&#x27;s instruction letter, the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum (JHCCOA) was founded first, in 1875, a year before Gilman&#x27;s inauguration. The construction of the asylum, including its educational and living facilities, was praised by &quot;The Nation&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore American&quot;. The &quot;Baltimore American&quot; reported wrote that the orphan asylum was a place where &quot;nothing was wanting that could benefit science and humanity&quot;. As was done for other Johns Hopkins institutions, it was planned after visits and correspondence with similar institutions in Europe and the U.S.

The Johns Hopkins Orphan Asylum opened with 24 boys and girls. Under Gilman and his successors, the orphanage was later changed to serve as an orphanage and training school for Black female orphans principally as domestic workers and as an orthopiedic convalescent home and school for &quot;colored crippled&quot; children and orphans. The asylum was eventually closed in 1924 nearly 50 years after it opened.

===Hospital, university, press, and schools of nursing and medicine===
In accordance with Hopkins&#x27; March 1873 instruction letter, the school of nursing was founded alongside the hospital in 1889 by the hospital board of trustees in consultation with Florence Nightingale. Both the nursing school and the hospital were founded over a decade after the founding of the orphan asylum in 1875 and the university in 1876. Hopkins&#x27;s instruction letter explicitly stated his vision for the hospital; first, to provide assistance to the poor of &quot;all races&quot;, no matter the indigent patient&#x27;s &quot;age, sex or color&quot;; second, that wealthier patients would pay for services and thereby subsidize the care provided to the indigent; third, that the hospital would be the administrative unit for the orphan asylum for African American children, which was to receive $25,000 in annual support out of the hospital&#x27;s half of the endowment; and fourth, that the hospital and orphan asylum should serve 400 patients and 400 children respectively; fifth, that the hospital should be part of the university, and, sixth, that religion but not sectarianism should be an influence in the hospital.

By the end of Gilman&#x27;s presidency, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Press, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum had been founded; the latter by the trustees, and the others in the order listed under the Gilman administration. &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;color&quot; were major issues in the early history of the Johns Hopkins Institutions. The founding of the school of nursing is usually linked to Johns Hopkins&#x27;s statements in his March 1873 instruction letter to the trustees that: &quot;I desire you to establish, in connection with the hospital, a training school for female nurses. This provision will secure the services of women competent to care for those sick in the hospital wards, and will enable you to benefit the whole community by supplying it with a class of trained and experienced nurses&quot;.

==Legacy==

Hopkins died on December 24, 1873, in Baltimore.

Following Hopkins&#x27;s death, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; published a lengthy obituary that reported, &quot;In the death of Johns Hopkins a career has been closed which affords a rare example of successful energy in individual accumulations, and of practical beneficence in devoting the gains thus acquired to the public.&quot; Hopkins&#x27; contribution to the founding of Johns Hopkins University become his greatest legacy and was the largest philanthropic bequest ever made to a U.S. educational institution.

Hopkins&#x27; Quaker faith and early life experiences, including the 1778 emancipation, had a lasting influence on him throughout his life. Beginning early in his life, Hopkins looked upon his wealth as a trust to benefit future generations. He told his gardener that, &quot;Like the man in the parable, I have had many talents given to me and I feel they are in trust. I shall not bury them but give them to the lads who long for a wider education&quot;. His philosophy quietly anticipated Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s much-publicized &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; by more than 25 years.

In 1973, Johns Hopkins was cited prominently in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;The Americans: The Democratic Experience&quot; by Daniel Boorstin, the Librarian of Congress from 1975 to 1987. From November 14, 1975, to September 6, 1976, a portrait of Hopkins was displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in an exhibit on the democratization of America based on Boorstin&#x27;s book. In 1989, the United States Postal Service issued a $1 postage stamp in Hopkins&#x27; honor, as part of the Great Americans series.

<text>Klas Bernhard Johannes Karlgren (; 15 October 1889 – 20 October 1978) was a Swedish sinologist and linguist who pioneered the study of Chinese historical phonology using modern comparative methods. In the early 20th century, Karlgren conducted large surveys of the varieties of Chinese and studied historical information on rhyming in ancient Chinese poetry, then used them to create the first ever complete reconstructions of what are now called Middle Chinese and Old Chinese.

==Early life and education==
Bernhard Karlgren was born on 15 October 1889 in Jönköping, Sweden. His father, Johannes Karlgren, taught Latin, Greek, and Swedish at the local high school. Karlgren showed ability in linguistics from a young age, and was interested in Sweden&#x27;s dialects and traditional folk stories. He mastered classical languages and was an accomplished translator of Greek poetry into his native language. He displayed an early interest in China, and wrote a drama, &quot;The White Hind,&quot; set in that country in his early teens. His first scholarly article, a phonetic transcription, based on a system devised by Johan August Lundell, of traditional folk stories from his native province of Småland, was completed when he was 14, and published in 1908 when he was only 18 years old. He studied Russian at Uppsala University under Johan August Lundell, a Slavicist interested in comparative linguistics. He graduated in 1909 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Nordic, Greek, and Slavonic languages. Although he initially intended to specialize in the Scandinavian languages, on the advice of his elder brother Anton Karlgren (18821973) he decided to focus on Chinese instead, attracted to it also by the fact that, as Lundell had told him, Chinese contained a great number of dialects. He departed for St. Petersburg, which, under the guidance of Vasily Vasilyev, had created one of the major European centres for the study of Chinese. While there, Karlgren, studying under A. I. Ivanov, won a grant to study Chinese dialects, even though he had no background in Chinese at that point.

Karlgren lived in China from 1910 to 1912. He achieved basic fluency and literacy after only a few months of study, and prepared a questionnaire of 3,100 Chinese characters to gather information on Chinese dialects. After his grant money ran out, Karlgren supported himself by teaching French and, famously, English, which, according to one anecdote, he had never been taught but had picked up from English-speaking passengers on the ship from Europe to China. In fact he had received a high credit in English in his final High School exams. He eventually gathered data on 19 different Mandarin dialects, as well as Shanghainese, the Fuzhou dialect of Eastern Min, and Cantonese, plus the Vietnamese and Japanese pronunciations of the characters in his questionnaire.

==Career==

Karlgren returned to Europe in January 1912, first staying in London, then in Paris, before arriving in Uppsala in his home country of Sweden, where in 1915 he produced his doctoral dissertation, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Studies on Chinese Phonology&quot;). Although his dissertation was written in French, most of his subsequent scholarly works were in English. After obtaining his doctorate, Karlgren taught at the University of Gothenburg, serving as its rector from 1931 to 1936.

In 1939, Karlgren succeeded Johan Gunnar Andersson as director of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities (), a post he held until 1959. This public museum was founded in 1926 on Andersson&#x27;s pioneering discoveries of prehistoric archaeology made in China in the 1920s, and later expanded to cover later periods as well as other parts of Asia. Karlgren had been in close contact with Andersson for many years, and also succeeded Andersson as editor of the museum&#x27;s journal, the &quot;Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities&quot; (BMFEA, 1929–) and continued in this position until the 1970s. Karlgren himself first published many of his own major works in this annual journal, or as books in the monograph series of the museum.

In 1946, Karlgren began a far-reaching attack on the then rather loosely argued historiography of ancient China. Reviewing the literature on China&#x27;s pre-Han history in his article &quot;Legends and Cults in Ancient China&quot;, he pointed out that &quot;a common feature to most of these treatises is a curious lack of critical method in the handling of the material&quot;. In particular, Karlgren criticised the unselective use of documents from different ages when reconstructing China&#x27;s ancient history. &quot;In this way very full and detailed accounts have been arrived at—but accounts that are indeed caricatures of scientifically established ones.&quot;

In 1950, Karlgren was inducted into the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Death and legacy ==

Karlgren died on 20 October 1978 in Stockholm at age 89.

Karlgren was the first scholar to use European-style principles of historical linguistics to study the Chinese language. He was also the first to reconstruct the sounds of what are now called Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (what he called &quot;Ancient Chinese&quot; and &quot;Archaic Chinese&quot; respectively). Karlgren suggested that at the very earliest stage recoverable, the personal pronouns were declined for case.

Karlgren attempted to unearth Chinese history itself from its linguistic development and diffusion. As he writes in his English adaptation &quot;Sound and Symbol in Chinese&quot; (1923), Chapter I: &quot;Thus, though Chinese traditions give no hint whatever of an immigration from any foreign country, and though there consequently is no external chronological &quot;point d&#x27;appui&quot;, we are nonetheless able to state, from internal evidence, that the Chinese tradition which places the reign of the emperor Yao in the twenty-fourth century B.C. is correct; that the Chinese even in those remote times were skilled astronomers; that they put down in writing in the Chinese language records of memorable events, and in all probability wrote their accounts soon after the events; in short, that a well-developed Chinese civilization—resting undoubtedly on foundations many centuries old—together with the Chinese language, existed on Chinese soil two thousand years before Christ.&quot;

Although important as a pioneer of historical Chinese linguistics, Karlgren&#x27;s original findings have been surpassed. Today the phonological systems proposed by Karlgren have largely been superseded, as their weaknesses are obvious: &quot;Karlgren saw himself as reconstructing phonetics, not phonology, and paid little attention to phonological structure. As a result, the systems he reconstructed often lack the symmetry and pattern which are in the phonological systems of natural languages.&quot; Nevertheless, Karlgren&#x27;s groundbreaking works laid the foundation of modern Chinese historical linguistics and many of his works are still used as works of reference.

<doc id="218871" wikidata="Q5643511" url="?curid=218871" title="Halsbury's Laws of England">
<text>Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England is an encyclopaedia of the law in England and Wales. It has an alphabetised title scheme for the areas of law, drawing on authorities including Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom, Measures of the Welsh Assembly, UK case law and European law. It is written by or in consultation with experts in the relevant field.

&quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws&quot; has an annual and monthly updating service. The encyclopaedia and updates are available in both hard copy and online, with some content available for free online.

==History==

In 1907 Stanley Shaw Bond, editor at Butterworths, began a project to produce a complete statement of the law of England and Wales that was authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date. Bond tracked down the former Lord Chancellor, The Earl of Halsbury, on holiday in Nice to invite him to be the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Laws of England&quot;.

Traditionally, the role of editor-in-chief of &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws&quot; is held by a former Lord Chancellor, and the current incumbent is Lord Mackay of Clashfern.

In 2007, &quot;Halsbury&#x27;s Laws&quot; celebrated its centenary with an evening of seminars led by Lord Mackay of Clashfern and professor Richard Susskind, and the publication of a collection of centenary essays.

==First edition==
The first edition was published in 31 volumes from 1907 to 1917. Since then, new editions have been launched at intervals of about 20 to 30 years.

Volume 1 was published in 1907. Its articles run from action to bankers and banking. The volume deals with action, admiralty, agency, agriculture, aliens, , animals, arbitration, auction, bailment and bankers and banking.

Volume 2 was published in 1908. Its articles run from bankruptcy to bills of exchange. It contains but four treatises, upon bankruptcy and insolvency (335 pages), barristers (67 pages), bastardy (28 pages) and bills of exchange, promissory notes and negotiable instruments (124 pages).

Volume 5 (companies) is devoted entirely to company law, and forms a treatise of 768 pages on that subject. After a general consideration of the nature and domicile of companies, the work considers briefly the history of company legislation. Then follows an elaborate treatise on the Companies Act 1908. Special companies, like banking, insurance and public service companies, are considered; as well as chartered companies, the livery companies of the City of London, quasi-corporations, and illegal companies; and a few pages are devoted to foreign companies. The reviewer in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; thought the table of cases cited must contain at least five thousand cases. He said the importance of this treatise was at once apparent; and that to the commercial lawyer in the Eastern cities of the United States it would be exceedingly useful.

The articles in volume 11 run from descent to ecclesiastical law. It contains a short article on descent and distribution; a discussion of discovery, inspection and interrogatories, under the English practice; an elaborate article on distress; an article on easements and profits, which the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; said was the most interesting article in the volume to an American lawyer; and an elaborate disquisition on ecclesiastical law.

The articles in volume 12 run from education to electric lighting and power. The &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; said that the articles on education and elections had comparatively little value to the American bar, but the hundred pages devoted to electric lighting and power were useful.

Volume 20 was published in 1911. Its articles run from markets to misrepresentation. It contains articles on markets and fairs (59 pages), master and servant (221 pages), medicine and pharmacy (82 pages), the Metropolis (106 pages), mines, minerals and quarries (156 pages) and misrepresentation and fraud (110 pages). According to the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, the article on master and servant was of constant interest to an American lawyer; and that on misrepresentation and fraud, from the master hand of G. Spencer Bower, was a valuable treatise in itself.
Volume 21 was published in 1912. Its articles run from mistake to partition. It contains articles on mistake (34 pages), money and money lending (29 pages), mortgage (283 pages), negligence (134 pages), notaries (9 pages), nuisance (72 pages), Parliament (197 pages) and partition (59 pages). The &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; said that the standard set by the preceding volumes appeared to be maintained and that the series, up to this volume, was a collection of very admirable treatises on English law.

==Second, third and fourth editions==
The second edition was published in 37 volumes from 1932 to 1941. The editor-in-chief was Viscount Hailsham. The managing editor was Sir Roland Burrows. The second edition of volume 5 was published in 1949. The second and subsequent editions of the encyclopaedia took the name of the said Earl of Halsbury.

The third edition was published in 43 volumes from 1952 to 1964. The general editor was Lord Simonds.

The fourth edition was published in 56 volumes from 1973 to 1987. The editor-in-chief was Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone. The editor-in-chief of volumes reissued from August 1998 onwards was Lord Mackay of Clashfern.

==Fifth edition==
Publication of the fifth edition began in 2008 and is being published in 103 volumes. It will have a new title scheme, a new updating service, and improved integration of European law. New titles for the fifth edition include, &quot;Sports Law&quot;, &quot;Information Technology Law&quot;, &quot;Financial Services and Institutions&quot;, &quot;Judicial Review&quot; and &quot;Environmental Quality and Public Health&quot;.

==Halsbury Legal Awards==
The Halsbury Legal Awards debuted in 2013. They celebrate the value that people in law bring to society. The theme of the awards is: &quot;The Whole of the law. Connected&quot;.

The awards recognise the achievements and talents of individuals and teams across the entire legal sector. The Bar, legal practice, in-house counsel, academia and legal journalism are all recognised, as are contribution to the promotion, growth and value of the sector.

==Halsbury Awards==
The Halsbury Awards, in association with the British and Irish Association of Law Librarians, were sponsored by Halsbury&#x27;s Laws from 2007 to 2012. They recognise outstanding performance given by legal information services, law libraries and teams managing legal collections and resources.

<doc id="218873" wikidata="Q1472068" url="?curid=218873" title="Johns Hopkins Hospital">
<text>Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1889, Johns Hopkins Hospital and its school of medicine are considered to be the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous famed medical traditions, including rounds, residents, and house staff. Several medical specialties were founded at the hospital, including neurosurgery by Harvey Cushing and Walter Dandy, cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, and child psychiatry by Leo Kanner. Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center, which serves infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21, is attached to the hospital.

Johns Hopkins Hospital is widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s greatest hospitals and medical institutions. For 21 consecutive years from 1991 to 2020, it was ranked as the best overall hospital in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In its 2019–2020 edition, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the hospital on 15 adult specialties and 10 children&#x27;s specialties; the hospital came in 1st in Maryland and third nationally behind the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 2021, the hospital marked 32 consecutive years of placing in the top five hospitals in the nation.

The hospital&#x27;s founding in 1889 was made possible from a philanthropic bequest of over $7 million by city merchant, banker, financier, civic leader, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins, which at the time was the largest bequest in the history of the United States. The hospital is located at 600 North Broadway in Baltimore.

==History==


===Founding===

Johns Hopkins (1795–1873), a Baltimore merchant and banker, left an estate of approximately $7 million (US$173.84 million in 2022) when he died on December 24, 1873, in his city mansion on West Saratoga Street, just west of North Charles Street, at the age of 78. In his will, he asked that his fortune be used to found three institutions that would bear his name: &quot;Johns Hopkins University&quot;, &quot;The Johns Hopkins Hospital&quot;, and &quot;Johns Hopkins Colored Orphan Asylum.&quot; At the time that it was made, Hopkins&#x27; gift was the largest philanthropic bequest in the history of the nation.

Toward the end of his life, Hopkins selected 12 prominent Baltimore residents as trustees for the project. A year prior to his death, he sent each a letter telling them that he was giving &quot;thirteen acres of land, situated in the city of Baltimore, and bounded by Broadway, Wolfe, Monument, and Jefferson streets upon which I desire you to erect a hospital.&quot; He wished for a hospital that &quot;shall, in construction and arrangement, compare favorably with any other institution of like character in this country or in Europe&quot; and directed his trustees to &quot;secure for the service of the Hospital, physicians and surgeons of the highest character and greatest skill.&quot;

Hopkins instructed the trustees to &quot;bear constantly in mind that it is my wish and purpose that the hospital shall ultimately form a part of the Medical School of that university for which I have made ample provision in my will.&quot; By calling for this integral relationship between patient care, as embodied in the hospital, and teaching and research, as embodied in the university, Hopkins laid the groundwork for a revolution in American medicine. Johns Hopkins&#x27; vision, of two institutions in which the practice of medicine would be wedded to medical research and medical education was revolutionary.

===19th century===

Initial plans for the hospital were drafted by surgeon John Shaw Billings, and the architecture designed by John Rudolph Niernsee and completed by Edward Clarke Cabot of the Boston firm of Cabot and Chandler in a Queen Anne style. When completed in 1889 at a cost of $2,050,000 (US$50.8 million in 2022), the hospital included what was then state-of-the-art concepts in heating and ventilation to check the spread of disease.

The trustees obtained the services of four outstanding physicians, known as the &quot;Big Four,&quot; to serve as the founding staff of the hospital when it opened on May 7, 1889. They were pathologist William Henry Welch, surgeon William Stewart Halsted, internist William Osler, and gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly.

In 1893, Johns Hopkins University was one of the first medical schools to admit women. The decision to begin coeducation was a result of a shortage of funds, as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad stock that was supposed to cover cost was used up in building the hospital in 1889 and the medical school had not yet been built. Four of the original trustees&#x27; daughters offered to raise the money needed to open the school, but only if the school agreed to admit qualified women to the university. After several discussions, the trustees agreed to their terms and accepted the financial help of these four women with only one of the doctors, William H. Welch, resisting. Eventually, even Welch changed his views on coeducation, &quot;The necessity for coeducation in some form,&quot; he wrote later, &quot;becomes more evident the higher the character of the education. In no form of education is this more evident than in that of medicine ... we regard coeducation a success; those of us who were not enthusiastic at the beginning are now sympathetic and friendly.&quot;

Osler, the first chief of the Department of Medicine, is credited with originating the idea of a residency, in which recently graduated physicians receive advanced training in their specialty while treating patients under supervision; then, as now, residents comprise most of the medical staff of the hospital. He also introduced the idea of bringing medical students into actual patient care early in their training; at the time medical school consisted almost entirely of lectures. Osler&#x27;s contribution to practical education extends to the creation of &quot;grand rounds&quot;, the practice of leading physicians discussing the most difficult cases in front of assembled medical students, for the benefit of patients and students. The term “rounds” derives from the circular ward where bedside teaching occurred. He once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, &quot;He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.&quot;

Halsted, the first chief of the Department of Surgery, established many other medical and surgical achievements at Johns Hopkins including modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, and the first radical mastectomy for breast cancer (before this time, such a diagnosis was a virtual death sentence). His other achievements included the introduction of the surgical glove and advances in thyroid, biliary tree, hernia, intestinal and arterial aneurysm surgeries. Halsted also established the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States.

Kelly is credited with establishing gynecology as a true medical specialty. He created new surgical approaches to women&#x27;s diseases and invented numerous medical devices, including a urinary cystoscope. He was one of the first to use radium to treat cancer, with his first patient being his own aunt in 1904, who died shortly after surgery. Kelly was known to use excessive amounts of radium to treat various cancers and tumors. As a result, some of his patients died from radium exposure. His method of radium application was inserting a radium capsule near the affected area, then sewing the radium &quot;points&quot; directly to the tumor.

Welch was responsible for training many of the outstanding physicians of the day, such as Walter Reed. He also founded at Hopkins the nation&#x27;s first Public Health school, now known as the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

A notable sight at the hospital is the marble statue &quot;Christus&quot;, a Carrara marble statue in the Billings Administration Building rotunda of the resurrected Jesus based on the 1833 original by Bertel Thorvaldsen, which was a gift by Baltimore merchant William Wallace Spence; it is a replica of the original by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorwaldsen in Copenhagen. Unveiled in 1896, the statue brings comfort to many, the hospital has said.

===20th century===

In 1903, Harriet Lane left a sum of over $400,000 at her death in 1903 to establish the &quot;Harriet Lane Home for Invalid Children&quot; as a memorial to two sons who had died in childhood. In October 1912 the &quot;Harriet Lane Home&quot; officially opened. It was the first children&#x27;s clinic in the United States that was associated with a medical school, first run by John Howland. Eventually treating over 60,000 children a year, the &quot;Harriet Lane Home&quot; became a pioneer treatment, teaching, and research clinic, and the first to have subspecialties in pediatrics as created by Edwards A. Park.

In 1912, Diamond Jim Brady donated $220,000 to the hospital, which created the James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute.

Ophthalmologist William Holland Wilmer opened the Wilmer Eye Institute at the hospital in 1925, and its building was completed four years later. Wilmer received a medical degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1885 and later worked in New York City, Washington D.C., and Baltimore, where he established the institute.

Between 1930 and 1963, Helen B. Taussig, who helped to develop the blue baby operation, headed the pediatric cardiac clinic. Child psychiatrist Leo Kanner did studies of autistic children. Lawson Wilkins established an endocrine clinic that developed procedures used universally to treat children with certain glandular disorders, including dwarfism. John E. Bordley and William G. Hardy made strides in detecting hearing impairments in very young children.

==Achievements==
Medical achievements at Johns Hopkins include the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery in the United States that took place in 1966 at the Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic.

Two of the most far-reaching advances in medicine during the last 25 years were also made at Hopkins. First, the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of restriction enzymes gave birth to the genetic engineering industry. Second, the discovery of the brain&#x27;s natural opiates has triggered an explosion of interest in neurotransmitter pathways and functions. Other accomplishments of the hospital include the development of HeLa by George Otto Gey, head of tissue culture research in 1951, the first and arguably most important line of human cells grown in culture, identification of the three types of polio virus, and the first &quot;blue baby&quot; operation, which was done by surgeon Alfred Blalock in collaboration with Helen Taussig, a Hopkins graduate specializing in pediatric cardiology and surgical technician Vivien Thomas that opened the way to modern cardiac surgery.

Contributions to heart surgery were brought on by the discovery of heparin and the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig Shunt. Johns Hopkins has also published &quot;The Harriet Lane Handbook&quot;, an indispensable tool for pediatricians, for over 60 years.

==Operations==

The hospital occupies approximately 20 of the 60 buildings on the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus. The complex has over 80 entrances and receives 80,000 visitors weekly. It houses over 1,000 beds and has a staff of over 1,700 doctors with over 30,000 total employees.

From 1982 to 1992, then CEO Robert Heyssel established the hospital&#x27;s first Oncology Center, the Nelson Patient Tower, the Clayton Heart Center and the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center which bears Heyssel&#x27;s name. In May 2012, the Johns Hopkins Hospital opened two new towers as part of a major campus redevelopment effort. The opening of the new $1.1 billion Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children&#x27;s Center tower and the new Sheikh Zayed Tower marked the highpoint of this effort. In addition to the main hospital, the system operates four other hospitals and several outpatient care facilities in the Baltimore and Washington metro areas and All Children&#x27;s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. In May, 2019, the hospital completed an $80 million expansion project at its Green Spring Station campus in Brooklandville, Maryland, offering out-patient surgery, imaging, and oncology treatment at the 3-story, &quot;Pavilion III&quot;.

Johns Hopkins also provides remote consultations worldwide through the Grand Round platform, and uses the same platform to help patients find the ideal specialist for their unique needs.

== Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center ==

Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center (JHCC) is a nationally ranked, pediatric acute care children&#x27;s teaching hospital located in Baltimore, Maryland, adjacent to Johns Hopkins Hospital. The hospital has 196 pediatric beds and is affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The hospital is the flagship pediatric member of Johns Hopkins Medicine and is 1 of 2 children&#x27;s hospital in the network. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout Baltimore and the wider United States. Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care.

Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center also features one of the only ACS verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in the state. The hospital is directly attached to Johns Hopkins Hospital and is situated near the Ronald McDonald House of Maryland.

==Rankings==
Johns Hopkins Hospital was ranked as the top overall hospital in the United States for 21 consecutive years by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; until 2012, when it moved to second place behind Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 2013, it was reinstated as the top hospital in the United States. In the 2016-2017 edition, Johns Hopkins ranks third-best nationally.

<text>In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction in certain areas, usually by subject, forming a legal code, i.e. a codex (book) of law. 

Codification is one of the defining features of civil law jurisdictions. In common law systems, such as that of English law, codification is the process of converting and consolidating judge-made law or uncodified statutes enacted by the legislature into statute law.

== History ==
Ancient Sumer&#x27;s Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled &quot;circa&quot; 2050–1230 BC, and is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him.

Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the &quot;Lex Duodecim Tabularum&quot; and much later the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule, however, as during much of ancient times Roman laws were left mostly uncodified.

The first &quot;permanent&quot; system of codified laws could be found in imperial China, with the compilation of the &quot;Tang Code&quot; in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code, which was eventually replaced by the &quot;Great Qing Legal Code&quot;, which was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch. A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804.

Upon confederation, the Iroquois created constitutional wampum, each component symbolizing one of the many laws within the 117 articles. The union of the five original nations occurred in 1142, and its unification narrative served the basis for the Iroquois laws.

Systems of religious laws include the halakha of Judaism and the &quot;sharia&quot; of Islam. The use of civil codes in &quot;sharia&quot; began with the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. American legal scholar Noah Feldman has written that the Ottoman codification of the sharia reduced the power of the religious scholarly class, upsetting the balance of powers and the traditional uncodified constitution of Islamic societies and leading to the rise of autocrats unconstrained by rule of law in the Muslim world.

==Civil law jurisdictions==

Civil law jurisdictions rely, by definition, on codification. Notable early examples were the Statutes of Lithuania, in the 16th century. The movement towards codification gained momentum during the Enlightenment, and was implemented in several European countries during the late 18th century (see civil code). However, it became widespread only after the enactment of the French Napoleonic Code (1804), which has heavily influenced the legal systems of many other countries.

==Common law jurisdictions==

Common law has been codified in many jurisdictions and in many areas of law: examples include criminal codes in many jurisdictions, and include the California Civil Code and the &quot;Consolidated Laws of New York&quot; (New York State).

===England and Wales===
The English judge Sir Mackenzie Chalmers is renowned as the draftsman of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Marine Insurance Act 1906, all of which codified existing common law principles. The Sale of Goods Act was repealed and re-enacted by the Sale of Goods Act 1979 in a manner that revealed how sound the 1893 original had been. The Marine Insurance Act (mildly amended) has been a notable success, adopted &quot;verbatim&quot; in many common law jurisdictions.

Most of England&#x27;s criminal laws have been codified, partly because this enables precision and certainty in prosecution. However, large areas of the common law, such as the law of contract and the law of tort remain remarkably untouched. In the last 80 years there have been statutes that address immediate problems, such as the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 (which, &quot;inter alia&quot;, coped with contracts rendered void by war), and the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which amended the doctrine of privity. However, there has been no progress on the adoption of Harvey McGregor&#x27;s &quot;Contract Code&quot; (1993), even though the Law Commission, together with the Scots Law Commission, asked him to produce a proposal for the comprehensive codification and unification of the contract law of England and Scotland. Similarly, codification in the law of tort has been at best piecemeal, a rare example of progress being the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945.

Consolidation bills are routinely passed to organize the law.

===Ireland===
Law of the Republic of Ireland evolved from English law, the greatest point of difference being the existence of the Constitution of Ireland as a single document. The unofficial &quot;popular edition&quot; of the Constitution is regularly updated to take account of amendments to it, while the official text enrolled in the Supreme Court in 1938 has been replaced five times: in 1942, 1980, 1989, 1999, and 2019. As in England, subordinate laws are not officially codified, although consolidation bills have restated the law in many areas. Since 2006 the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has published semi-official &quot;revised&quot; editions of Acts of the Oireachtas taking account of textual and other amendments to the original version. The Finance Acts are excluded from the LRC programme. Private companies produce unofficial consolidated versions of these and other commercially important pre-2005 laws. An official advisory committee between 2006 and 2010 produced a Draft Criminal Code.

=== United States ===

==== The early codification movement ====
In the United States, a critique of the inherited English tradition of common law and an argument for systematic codification was championed by the United Irish exiles William Sampson (admitted to the New York bar in 1806), and William Duane publisher of the Jeffersonian paper, the &quot;Philadelphia Aurora.&quot; In 1810, Sampson published &quot;Trial of the Journeymen Cordwainers of the City of New-York for a Conspiracy to Raise Their Wages,&quot; commentary on his (unsuccessful) argument in &quot;The People v Melvin&quot; (1806) to quash an indictment of illegal worker combination. Insisting on the supremacy of the elected legislature, Sampson&#x27;s objected that the prosecution was reasoning &quot;abstractedly&quot; from principles of English common law without any reference to statute. It was this, alone, that allowed them to deny journeymen the right to &quot;conspire against starvation&quot; while, without notice or challenge, leaving master tradesmen in a &quot;permanent conspiracy&quot; to suppress wages. He went on to argue that an &quot;indiscriminating adoption of common law&quot; had caused the New-World society to carry over &quot;barbarities&quot; from the Old: laws that &quot;can only be executed upon those not favoured by fortune with certain privileges&quot; and that in some cases operate &quot;entirely against the poor&quot;. 

Sampson&#x27;s summary &quot;Discourse on the Common Law&quot; (1823), holding common law to be contrary to the ethos a democratic republic and urging, with reference to the Code Napoleon, its replacement by a general law of reference, was hailed as &quot;the most sweeping indictment of common law idealism ever written in America&quot; . It was a source of inspiration for Edward Livingston who drew upon French, and other European, civil law in drafting the 1825 Louisiana Code of Procedure. Later, Sampson&#x27;s efforts appeared vindicated in New York where in 1846 a new state constitution directed that the whole body of state law be reduced to a written and systematic code, and in David Dudley Field&#x27;s subsequent drafting of the New York Code of Civil Procedure (1848).

Sampson sought to disassociate codification from the doctrinaire insistence on positive legislation that had marked Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s championing of the cause in Britain. But, focussing on the French experience, critics thought it sufficient to comment on the futility of trying to compress human behaviour into rigid categories. President Thomas Jefferson had remained neutral when Duane&#x27;s attempted to force the issue in the 1805 election in Pennsylvania. Federalists joined with &quot;Constitutional Republicans&quot; to defeat the reform agenda.

==== Present status ====
===== Statutory =====
In the United States, acts of Congress, such as federal statutes, are published chronologically in the order in which they become law – often by being signed by the President, on an individual basis in official pamphlets called &quot;slip laws&quot;, and are grouped together in official bound book form, also chronologically, as &quot;session laws&quot;. The &quot;session law&quot; publication for Federal statutes is called the United States Statutes at Large. A given act may be a single page or hundreds of pages in length. An act may be classified as either a &quot;Public Law&quot; or a &quot;Private Law&quot;.

Because each Congressional act may contain laws on a variety of topics, many acts, or portions thereof, are also rearranged and published in a topical, subject matter codification by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel. The official codification of Federal statutes is called the United States Code. Generally, only &quot;Public Laws&quot; are codified. The United States Code is divided into &quot;titles&quot; (based on overall topics) numbered 1 through 54. Title 18, for example, contains many of the Federal criminal statutes. Title 26 is the Internal Revenue Code.

Even in code form, however, many statutes by their nature pertain to more than one topic. For example, the statute making tax evasion a felony pertains to both criminal law and tax law, but is found only in the Internal Revenue Code. Other statutes pertaining to taxation are found not in the Internal Revenue Code but instead, for example, in the Bankruptcy Code in Title 11 of the United States Code, or the Judiciary Code in Title 28. Another example is the national minimum drinking age, not found in Title 27, &quot;Intoxicating liquors&quot;, but in Title 23, &quot;Highways&quot;, §158.

Further, portions of some Congressional acts, such as the provisions for the effective dates of amendments to codified laws, are themselves not codified at all. These statutes may be found by referring to the acts as published in &quot;slip law&quot; and &quot;session law&quot; form. However, commercial publications that specialize in legal materials often arrange and print the uncodified statutes with the codes to which they pertain.

In the United States, the individual states, either officially or through private commercial publishers, generally follow the same three-part model for the publication of their own statutes: slip law, session law, and codification.

===== Regulatory =====
Rules and regulations that are promulgated by agencies of the Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government are published in the Federal Register and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are authorized by specific legislation passed by the legislative branch, and generally have the same force as statutory law.

==International law codification==

Following the First World War and the establishment of the League of Nations, the need for codification of international law arose. In September 1924, the General Assembly of the League established a committee of experts for the purpose of codification of international law, which was defined by the Assembly as consisting of two aspects:
* Putting existing customs into written international agreements
* Developing further rules
In 1930 the League of Nations held at the Hague a conference for the purpose of codification of rules on general matters, but very little progress was made.

Following the Second World War, the International Law Commission was established within the United Nations as a permanent body for the formulation of principles in international law.

==Canon law codification==

Papal attempts at codification of the scattered mass of canon law spanned the eight centuries since Gratian produced his &quot;Decretum&quot; . In the 13th century especially canon law became the object of scientific study, and different compilations were made by the Roman Pontiffs. The most important of these were the five books of the &quot;Decretales Gregorii IX&quot; and the &quot;Liber Sextus&quot; of Boniface VIII. The legislation grew with time. Some of it became obsolete, and contradictions crept in so that it became difficult in recent times to discover what was of obligation and where to find the law on a particular question.
Since the close of the ‘’Corpus Juris’’ numerous new laws and decrees had been issued by popes, councils, and Roman Congregations. No complete collection of them had ever been published and they remained scattered through the ponderous volumes of the ‘’Bullaria’’ the ‘’Acta Sanctae Sedis’’, and other such compilations, which were accessible to only a few and for professional canonists themselves and formed an unwieldy mass of legal material. Moreover, not a few ordinances, whether included in the ‘’Corpus Juris’’ or of more recent date, appeared to be contradictory; some had been formally abrogated, others had become obsolete by long disuse; others, again, had ceased to be useful or applicable in the present condition of society. Great confusion was thus engendered and correct knowledge of the law rendered very difficult even for those who had to enforce it.

When the Vatican Council met in 1869 a number of bishops of different countries petitioned for a new compilation of church law that would be clear and easily studied. The council never finished its work and no attempt was made to bring the legislation up to date. By the 19th Century, this body of legislation included some 10,000 norms. Many of these were difficult to reconcile with one another due to changes in circumstances and practice. In response to the request of the bishops at the First Vatican Council, on 14 May 1904, with the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Arduum sane munus&quot; (&quot;A Truly Arduous Task&quot;), Pope Pius X set up a commission to begin reducing these diverse documents into a single code, presenting the normative portion in the form of systematic short canons shorn of the preliminary considerations (&quot;Whereas...&quot;) and omitting those parts that had been superseded by later developments.

By the winter of 1912, the &quot;whole span of the code&quot; had been completed, so that a provisional text was printed. This 1912 text was sent out to all Latin bishops and superiors general for their comment, and their notations which they sent back to the codification commission were subsequently printed and distributed to all members of the commission, in order that the members might carefully consider the suggestions. The new code was completed in 1916. Under the aegis of Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law was completed under Benedict XV, Pius X&#x27;s successor, who promulgated it on 27 May 1917 as the Code of Canon Law () and set 19 May 1918 as the date on which it came into force. In its preparation centuries of material were examined, scrutinized for authenticity by leading experts, and harmonized as much as possible with opposing canons and even other codes, from the Codex of Justinian to the Napoleonic Code. It contained 2,414 canons and was in force until Canon 6 §1 1° of the &quot;1983 Code of Canon Law&quot; took legal effect—thereby abrogating it—on 27 November 1983.

==Recodification==
Recodification refers to a process where existing codified statutes are reformatted and rewritten into a new codified structure. This is often necessary as, over time, the legislative process of amending statutes and the legal process of construing statutes by nature over time results in a code that contains archaic terms, superseded text, and redundant or conflicting statutes. Due to the size of a typical government code, the legislative process of recodification of a code can often take a decade or longer.

<doc id="218875" wikidata="Q472228" url="?curid=218875" title="The Mysterious Affair at Styles">
<text>The Mysterious Affair at Styles is the first detective novel by British writer Agatha Christie, introducing her fictional detective Hercule Poirot. It was written in the middle of the First World War, in 1916, and first published by John Lane in the United States in October 1920 and in the United Kingdom by The Bodley Head (John Lane&#x27;s UK company) on 21 January 1921.

&quot;Styles&quot; introduced Poirot, Inspector (later, Chief Inspector) Japp, and Arthur Hastings. Poirot, a Belgian refugee of the Great War, is settling in England near the home of Emily Inglethorp, who helped him to his new life. His friend Hastings arrives as a guest at her home. When Mrs Inglethorp is murdered, Poirot uses his detective skills to solve the mystery.

The book includes maps of the house, the murder scene, and a drawing of a fragment of a will. The true first publication of the novel was as a weekly serial in &quot;The Times&quot;, including the maps of the house and other illustrations included in the book. This novel was one of the first ten books published by Penguin Books when it began in 1935.

&quot;Styles&quot; was well received by reviewers in the UK and the US at initial publication. An analysis in 1990 was positive about the plot, considered the novel one of the few by Christie that is well-anchored in time and place, a story that knows it describes the end of an era, and mentions that the plot is clever. Christie had not mastered cleverness throughout her first novel, as &quot;too many clues tend to cancel each other out&quot;; this was judged a difficulty &quot;which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.&quot;

The story features many of the elements that have become icons of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, largely due to Christie&#x27;s influence. It is set in a large, isolated country manor. There are a half-dozen suspects, most of whom are hiding facts about themselves. The plot includes a number of red herrings and surprise twists.

&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; launched Christie&#x27;s writing career. Christie and her husband subsequently named their house &quot;Styles&quot;. Hercule Poirot would go on to become one of the most famous characters in fiction. Decades later, when Christie told the story of Poirot&#x27;s final case in &quot;Curtain&quot;, she set that novel at Styles.

==Composition and original publication==
Agatha Christie began working on &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; in 1916, writing most of it on Dartmoor. The character of Hercule Poirot was inspired by her experience working as a nurse, ministering to Belgian soldiers during the First World War, and by Belgian refugees who were living in Torquay.

The manuscript was rejected by Hodder and Stoughton and Methuen. Christie then submitted the manuscript to The Bodley Head. After keeping the submission for several months, The Bodley Head&#x27;s founder, John Lane, offered to accept it, provided that Christie make slight changes to the ending. She revised the next-to-last chapter, changing the scene of Poirot&#x27;s grand revelation from a courtroom to the Styles library. (Some modern editions of the published book also include an appendix with the original &quot;unpublished&quot; alternative ending set in the courtroom. It is very similar to the final version in content, with dialogue from other characters replaced by dialogue from the Judge and Sir Ernest Heavywether.) Christie later stated that the contract she signed with Lane was exploitative.

&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; was also said to have been inspired by a real-life murder case in Mussoorie, India.

&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; was published by John Lane in the United States in October 1920 and by The Bodley Head in the United Kingdom on 21 January 1921. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).

==Plot summary==
During the First World War, Arthur Hastings is on sick leave from the Western Front and is invited to stay at the manor house of Styles Court in Essex by his old friend John Cavendish.

On the morning of 18 July, the Styles household wakes to the discovery that Emily Inglethorp, the elderly and wealthy owner, has died. She had been poisoned with strychnine. Hastings ventures out to the nearby village of Styles St Mary to enlist help from his friend Hercule Poirot. Emily&#x27;s household includes her husband, Alfred Inglethorp — a younger man she recently married; her stepsons (from her first husband&#x27;s previous marriage) John and Lawrence Cavendish; John&#x27;s wife Mary Cavendish; Cynthia Murdoch, the daughter of a deceased friend of the family; and Evelyn Howard, Emily&#x27;s lady&#x27;s companion.

Poirot learns that, on Emily&#x27;s death, John is to inherit the manor property, in accordance with his father&#x27;s will. However, her money will be distributed according to her own will, which she changes at least once a year. Her most recent will favours Alfred, who will now inherit her fortune. 

On the day of the murder, Emily had been arguing with someone, suspected to be either Alfred or John. She had been distressed after this and apparently made a new will, but no one can find any evidence of the new will. Alfred left the manor early that evening and stayed overnight in the village. Meanwhile, Emily ate little at dinner and retired early to her room, taking her document case with her. When her body is found, the case had been forced open. Nobody can explain how or when the poison was administered to her.

Inspector Japp, the investigating officer, considers Alfred to be the prime suspect, as he gains the most from his wife&#x27;s death. Poirot notes that Alfred&#x27;s behaviour is suspicious during the investigation. He refuses to provide an alibi and denies purchasing the strychnine in the village, despite evidence to the contrary. Although Japp is keen to arrest him, Poirot intervenes by proving he could not have purchased the poison—the signature for the purchase is not in his handwriting. Suspicion now falls on John, next to gain from Emily&#x27;s will and without an alibi for the murder. Japp soon arrests him: the signature for the poison is in his handwriting; a phial that contained the poison is found in his room; a false beard and a pair of pince-nez identical to Alfred&#x27;s are found within the manor.

Poirot&#x27;s investigations exonerate John of the crime. He establishes that the murder was committed by Alfred Inglethorp, with aid from his cousin Evelyn Howard. The pair pretended to be enemies but were romantically involved. They added bromide, obtained from her sleeping powder, to Emily&#x27;s regular evening medicine. This caused the low level of strychnine in the medicine to precipitate to the bottom of the bottle, making the final dose lethal. The pair then left false evidence that would incriminate Alfred, which they knew would be refuted at his trial. Once acquitted, he could not be tried for the crime again if genuine evidence against him was found, under the law of double jeopardy. The pair framed John as part of their plan. Evelyn forged his handwriting, and the evidence against him was fabricated.

Poirot explains that he prevented Japp from arresting Alfred because Poirot could see that Alfred wanted to be arrested. Emily&#x27;s distress on the afternoon of the murder was because she had found a letter in Alfred&#x27;s desk while searching for stamps. Emily&#x27;s document case was forced open by Alfred when he realised she had the letter. He then hid the letter elsewhere in the room to avoid being found with it. Thanks to a chance remark by Hastings, Poirot finds the letter in Emily&#x27;s room. It details Alfred&#x27;s intentions for Evelyn.

==Dedication==

The book&#x27;s dedication reads: &quot;To my Mother&quot;.

Christie&#x27;s mother, Clarissa (&quot;Clara&quot;) Boehmer Miller (1854–1926), was a strong influence on her life and someone to whom Christie was extremely close, especially after the death of her father in 1901. It was while Christie was ill (circa 1908) that her mother suggested she write a story. The result was &quot;The House of Beauty&quot;, now a lost work, which hesitantly started her writing career. Christie later revised this story as &quot;The House of Dreams&quot;, and it was published in issue 74 of &quot;The Sovereign Magazine&quot; in January 1926 and, many years later, in 1997, in book form in &quot;While the Light Lasts and Other Stories&quot;.

Christie also dedicated her debut novel as Mary Westmacott, &quot;Giant&#x27;s Bread&quot; (1930), to her mother who, by that time, had died.

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (3 February 1921) gave the book an enthusiastic, if short, review, which stated: &quot;The only fault this story has is that it is almost too ingenious.&quot; It went on to describe the basic set-up of the plot and concluded: &quot;It is said to be the author&#x27;s first book, and the result of a bet about the possibility of writing a detective story in which the reader would not be able to spot the criminal. Every reader must admit that the bet was won.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; (26 December 1920), was also impressed:
The novel&#x27;s review in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of 20 February 1921, quoted the publisher&#x27;s promotional blurb concerning Christie writing the book as the result of a bet that she would not be able to do so without the reader being able to guess the murderer, then said, &quot;Personally we did not find the &quot;spotting&quot; so very difficult, but we are free to admit that the story is, especially for a first adventure in fiction, very well contrived, and that the solution of the mystery is the result of logical deduction. The story, moreover, has no lack of movement, and the several characters are well drawn.&quot;

The contributor who wrote his column under the pseudonym of &quot;A Man of Kent&quot; in the 10 February 1921 issue of the Christian newspaper &quot;The British Weekly&quot; praised the novel but was overly generous in giving away the identity of the murderers. To wit,
The Bodley Head quoted excerpts from this review in future books by Christie but, understandably, did not use those passages which gave away the identity of the culprits.

&quot;Introducing Hercule Poirot, the brilliant – and eccentric – detective who, at a friend&#x27;s request, steps out of retirement – and into the shadows of a classic mystery on the outskirts of Essex. The victim is the wealthy mistress of Styles Court, found in her locked bedroom with the name of her late husband on her dying lips. Poirot has a few questions for her fortune-hunting new spouse, her aimless stepsons, her private doctor, and her hired companion. The answers are positively poisonous. Who&#x27;s responsible, and why, can only be revealed by the master detective himself.&quot; (Book jacket, Berkley Book edition April 1984)

In his book, &quot;A Talent to Deceive – An Appreciation of Agatha Christie&quot;, Robert Barnard wrote:


In the &quot;Binge!&quot; article of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; as an &quot;EW favorite&quot; on the list of the &quot;Nine Great Christie Novels&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Television===

====British====

&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; was adapted as an episode for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; on 16 September 1990; the episode was specially made by ITV to celebrate the centenary of the author&#x27;s birth. The cast included David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Lieutenant Arthur Hastings and Philip Jackson as Inspector James Japp. It was filmed at Chavenage House in Gloucestershire, England. The adaptation was generally faithful to Christie&#x27;s story, although there were a number of deviations from it. The introduction of Poirot is greatly extended, including scenes of Poirot interrupting a military exercise, singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; with the Belgian refugees, and advising the post office of a better way to organize their products by country of origin. The adaptation also provided further elaboration on Hastings&#x27; first meeting with Poirot – the pair met during an investigation into a shooting, in which Hastings was a suspect.

====Latvian====

The novel was adapted as a TV miniseries for Latvijas Televīzija, titled &quot;Slepkavība Stailzā&quot;. It was broadcast over 3 nights in 1990. The cast included as Puaro (Poirot&#x27;s name in Latvian) and Romāns Birmanis as Hastingss (Hastings). Being a miniseries, with a total runtime of approximately 198 minutes, it included many details from the novel that were omitted from other shorter adaptations, and was generally faithful to the novel. One difference from the novel is that the inquest hearing is omitted, and instead there are more scenes from Džaps and Samerhejs (Japp and Summerhaye) searching for clues at Styles Court. Also, the ending sequence follows Christie&#x27;s original unpublished version, where Poirot makes his final revelations in the courtroom.

====French====

It was adapted for an episode of &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;, which was broadcast in 2016. The series stars Samuel Labarthe as Swan Laurence, who replaces the character of Poirot in this adaptation. This version has many differences from the novel, but the core story is the same: a wealthy old woman is murdered by her husband together with her top business partner, who appear to hate each other but are secretly lovers. Certain aspects from the novel are retained, such as a disguise used to buy the poison with Eve Constantin (the character equivalent to Evelyn Howard) impersonating Adrien Sauvignac (the equivalent of Alfred Inglethorp), and the latter&#x27;s deliberate attempt to get himself arrested so that he can produce his alibi. In this adaptation, Styles Court is a beauty spa instead of a country house.

====Hungarian====

In 2022, experimental Hungarian filmmaker Péter Lichter produced &quot;A titokzatos stylesi eset&quot;, a 65 minute adaptation. The film consisted of spliced footage from over 100 different silent films, combined with old school computer effects. Pál Mácsai provided narration as Poirot.

===Audio===
The novel was adapted for radio by Michael Bakewell as a five-part serial in 2005, as part of the &quot;Hercule Poirot&quot; radio series for BBC Radio 4. The cast included John Moffatt as Poirot and Simon Williams as Captain Hastings. Inspector Japp was played by Philip Jackson, who had played the same role in the British television adaptation. The serial was broadcast weekly from 5 September to 3 October. All five episodes were recorded on 4 April 2005 at Bush House. This version retained the first-person narration by the character of Hastings.

An adaptation for Audible was released on November 14, 2024, directed by Alice Lowe, and adapted by Anna Lea. The ensemble cast features Peter Dinklage as Poirot, Himesh Patel as Hastings, Jessica Gunning as Evie Howard, Harriet Walter as Emily Inglethorp, Rob Delaney as Alfred Inglethorp, Phil Dunster as John Cavendish, Patsy Ferran as Mary Cavendish, John Bradley as Lawrence Cavendish, and Vivian Oparah as Cynthia Murdoch.

===Stage===
On 14 February 2012, Great Lakes Theater in Cleveland, Ohio debuted a 65-minute stage adaptation as part of their educational programming. Adapted by David Hansen, this production is performed by a cast of five (3 men, 2 women) with most performers playing more than one role.

On 17 March 2016, the Hedgerow Theatre company in Media, Pennsylvania, premiered an adaptation by Jared Reed. While largely faithful to the novel, the character of Inspector Japp was omitted.

The novel received its first true publication as an eighteen-part serialisation in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Edition&quot; (aka &quot;The Times Weekly Edition&quot;) from 27 February (Issue 2252) to 25 June 1920 (Issue 2269). This version of the novel mirrored the published version with no textual differences and included the maps and illustrations of handwriting examples used in the novel. At the end of the serialisation an advertisement appeared in the newspaper, which announced, &quot;This is a brilliant mystery novel, which has had the unique distinction for a first novel of being serialised in &quot;The Times Weekly Edition&quot;. Mr John Lane is now preparing a large edition in volume form, which will be ready immediately.&quot; Although another line of the advertisement stated that the book would be ready in August, it was first published by John Lane in the United States in October 1920 and was not published in the UK by The Bodley Head until the following year.

&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; later made publishing history by being one of the first ten books to be published by Penguin Books when they were launched on 30 July 1935. The book was Penguin Number 6.

The blurb on the inside flap of the dustwrapper of the first edition reads:
This novel was originally written as the result of a bet, that the author, who had previously never written a book, could not compose a detective novel in which the reader would not be able to &quot;spot&quot; the murderer, although having access to the same clues as the detective. The author has certainly won her bet, and in addition to a most ingenious plot of the best detective type she has introduced a new type of detective in the shape of a Belgian. This novel has had the unique distinction for a first book of being accepted by the &quot;Times&quot; as a serial for its weekly edition.

<text>The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, was an action of the American Revolutionary War fought on August 27, 1776, at and near the western edge of Long Island in present-day Brooklyn. The British defeated the Continental Army and gained access to the strategically important Port of New York, which they held for the rest of the war. It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia. It was the largest battle of the Revolutionary War in terms of both troop deployment and combat.

After defeating the British in the siege of Boston on March 17, Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington relocated his army to defend the port city of New York, located at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city&#x27;s harbor would provide an excellent base for the Royal Navy, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor on the sparsely populated Staten Island, where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in Lower New York Bay over the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and accordingly moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that it would be the first target.

On August 21, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south of the established East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked the American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture, although a stand by 400 Maryland and Delaware troops prevented greater losses. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege, but on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. The Continental Army was driven out of Manhattan entirely after several more defeats and was forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

==Prelude to battle==
In the first stage of the war, the British Army was trapped in the peninsular city of Boston and were forced to abandon it on March 17, sailing to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to await reinforcements. Washington then began to transfer regiments to New York City, which he believed the British would attack next because of the port&#x27;s strategic importance. He had sent his second-in-command, Charles Lee, ahead to New York the previous February to establish the city&#x27;s defenses. Washington left Boston on April 4, arrived in New York on April 13, and established headquarters at the former home of Archibald Kennedy on Broadway facing Bowling Green.

Lee remained in New York City until March when the Continental Congress sent him to South Carolina; construction of the city&#x27;s defenses was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded that in any case, it would be impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling was built across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee had also seen to it that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.

===Strategy===

Washington began moving troops to Brooklyn in early May, and there were several thousand of them there in a short time. Three more forts were under construction on the eastern side of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam, Fort Greene, and Fort Box (named for Major Daniel Box). They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons.

Fort Defiance was also being constructed at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook. In addition to these new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green on Manhattan, and more cannons were placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River. Hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.

Washington had been authorized by Congress to recruit an army of up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of a large number of people from different regional cultures and temperaments living in relatively close proximity.

Commander of the artillery Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew the artillery. In early June, Knox and General Nathanael Greene inspected the land at the north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River. The forts were intended to discourage the British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.

===British arrival===

On June 28, General Washington learned that the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and was heading toward New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men stationed on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. The population of New York went into a panic at the sight of the British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The Continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens&#x27; militia switched over to the British side. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island under the command of Richard Howe, the brother of General Howe.

On July 6, news reached New York that Congress had voted for independence four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons of the city to hear the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue&#x27;s head, severed the nose, mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, and the rest of the statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.

On July 12, the British ships &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot; Rose&quot; sailed up the harbor toward the mouth of the Hudson. The American batteries opened fire from the harbor defenses of Fort George, Fort Defiance, and Governors Island, but the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part of the Hudson. The goals of the British ships were to cut off American supplies from New England and the north and to encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up.

The next day, July 13, Howe attempted to open negotiations with the Americans. He sent a letter to Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under a flag of truce. The letter was addressed to &quot;George Washington, Esq.&quot; Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington&#x27;s orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that there was no one in the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address &quot;George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.&quot;, but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe&#x27;s adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe&#x27;s adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, &quot;Those who have committed no fault want no pardon.&quot; Patterson departed soon after. Washington&#x27;s performance during the meeting was praised in many parts of the country.

Meanwhile, British ships continued to arrive. On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived. At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 warships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure as to where the British would attack. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, and the other half on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.

===Invasion of Long Island===

At 05:10 on August 22, an advance guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island under the command of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand&#x27;s Pennsylvanian riflemen had been stationed on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.

Washington received word of the landings the same day but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops. This convinced him that it was the feint that he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing the total number of troops on Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island. Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000. There was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.

The American plan was for Putnam to direct the defenses from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their troops would be stationed forward on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell back to the main defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, in the center of the American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Pass even further to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known path through the heights called the Jamaica Pass, farthest to the east, which was patrolled by just five militia officers on horseback.

On the British side, General Clinton learned of the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan and gave it to William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton&#x27;s plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front. On August 26, Clinton received word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant&#x27;s British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.

==Battle==
===Night march===

At 21:00, the British moved out. No one except the commanders knew of the plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light infantry with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.

The column had yet to run into any American troops when they reached Howard&#x27;s Tavern (also known as &quot;Howard&#x27;s Half-Way House&quot;), just a few hundred yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). William Howard Jr. describes meeting Howe:
It was about two in the morning of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father standing in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, &quot;I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass.&quot; My father replied, &quot;We belong to the other side, General, and can&#x27;t serve you against our duty.&quot; General Howe replied, &quot;That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill.&quot; My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, &quot;You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head.

Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia officers stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan&#x27;s men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton&#x27;s troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.

=== Grant&#x27;s diversionary attack ===

At about 23:00 on August 26, the first shots were fired in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee&#x27;s Pennsylvania regiment fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.

Around 01:00 on August 27, the British approached the vicinity of the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte–Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.

Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were stationed farther north on the Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was a veteran of the French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass. He lit signals to Washington, who was on Manhattan, and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.

Stirling led two units of Colonel John Haslet&#x27;s 1st Delaware Regiment under the immediate command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood&#x27;s 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson&#x27;s Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee and stop the British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.

Stirling placed Atlee&#x27;s men in an apple orchard owned by Wynant Bennett on the south side of the Gowanus Road near present-day 3rd Avenue and 18th Street. Upon the approach of the British, the Americans:
:::took possession of a hill about two miles from camp, and detached Colonel Atlee to meet them further on the road; in about sixty rods he drew up and received the enemy&#x27;s fire and gave them a well-directed fire from his regiment, which did great execution, and then retreated to the hill. – General Parsons

Stirling took up positions with the Delaware and Maryland regiments just to the north of Atlee&#x27;s men on the slopes of a rise of land between 18th and 20th streets. Some of the Maryland troops were positioned on a small hill near today&#x27;s 23rd Street, which the local Dutch called &quot;Blokje Berg&quot; (Dutch for cube or block hill). At the base of this hill, the Gowanus Road crossed a small bridge over a ditch which drained a marshy area. When the British advanced up the Gowanus Road, the American troops fired upon them from positions on the north side of the ditch. To their left was Colonel Peter Kachline&#x27;s Pennsylvania regiment.

Just to the southeast of &quot;Blokje Berg&quot; were a few hills; amongst them was a hill which is the highest point in King&#x27;s County at 220 feet which came to be known as &quot;Battle Hill,&quot; in what is today Greenwood Cemetery by the cemetery&#x27;s boundary of 23rd Street and 7th Avenue. The British attempted to outflank the American positions by taking this hill. The Americans tried to prevent the British move, sending troops under Parsons and Atlee to take the hill. The British got there first but the Americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting. Battle Hill was the site of especially brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to believe that they had killed &quot;General&quot; James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.

The Americans were still unaware that this was not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the fighting and the number of British troops engaged.

===Battle Pass===

The Hessians, in the center under the command of General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines stationed at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan. The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who were in the process of outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant&#x27;s attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.

Howe fired his signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard to hold off the Hessians while he turned the rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy casualties mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. It was later claimed that Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.

=== Vechte–Cortelyou House ===
At 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan. He realized that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.

Stirling still held the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling&#x27;s center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, from the south up the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across Brouwer&#x27;s millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, where the American defenses on Brooklyn Heights lay on the other side.

====Maryland 400====
Stirling ordered all of his troops to cross the creek, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Gist. This group became known to history as the &quot;Maryland 400&quot;, although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops, which surpassed 2,000 supported by two cannons. Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British, who were in fixed positions inside and in front of the Vechte–Cortelyou House (known today as the &quot;Old Stone House&quot;). After the last assault, the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud and under musket fire, and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through their lines to von Heister&#x27;s Hessians and surrendered to them. Two hundred fifty six Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House, and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines. Washington watched from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of today&#x27;s Court Street and Atlantic Avenue) and reportedly said, &quot;Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose.&quot;

=== Disengagement ===
Continental Army troops who were not killed or captured escaped behind the fortified American position at Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault on the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the Americans to be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy in control of the East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.

Howe&#x27;s failure to press the attack and the reasons for it have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the casualties that his army suffered when attacking the Continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He may also have been giving Washington an opportunity to conclude that his position was hopeless and surrender, in the European gentleman-officer tradition. Howe told Parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive British casualties for insufficient purpose, and capturing Brooklyn Heights would likely not have meant capturing the entire American army. &quot;The most essential duty I had to observe was, not wantonly to commit his majesty&#x27;s troops, where the object was inadequate. I knew well that any considerable loss sustained by the army could not speedily, nor easily, be repaired. . . . The loss of 1,000, or perhaps 1,500 British troops, in carrying those lines, would have been but ill repaid by double that number of the enemy, could it have been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Retreat to Manhattan===

Washington and the Continental Army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British would not have to cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28, and two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover&#x27;s regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts responded to Washington, sending troops. Thomas Mifflin, who commanded the Pennsylvania troops after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, rain began to fall, and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.
As the rain continued, Washington sent a letter instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge over the Harlem River between Manhattan and what is now The Bronx, to send every flat-bottomed boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey came to reinforce their position. At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn. The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.

The troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts men, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.

As more troops were evacuated, more were ordered to withdraw from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin&#x27;s rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit&#x27;s turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin&#x27;s troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed &quot;Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us.&quot; Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.

Artillery, supplies, and troops were all being evacuated across the river at this time but it was not going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.

===Conclusion of the campaign===

The British were stunned to find that Washington and the Continental Army had escaped. Later that day, on August 30, British troops occupied Washington and the Continental Army&#x27;s fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it led to many celebratory festivities. Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows, and King George III awarded Howe the Order of the Bath.

Washington&#x27;s defeat, in the opinions of some, revealed his deficiencies as a military strategist. Splitting his forces resulted in his largely inexperienced generals misunderstanding the state of the battle, and his raw troops fled in disorder at the first shots. However, Washington and the Continental Army&#x27;s daring retreat later that night has been seen by some historians as one of General Washington&#x27;s greatest military accomplishments. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.

Howe remained inactive for the next half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip&#x27;s Bay. The British quickly occupied the city. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, Nathan Hale was executed for spying.

===Casualties===
At the time, it was by far the largest battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe reported his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships in Wallabout Bay, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.

Historians believe that as many as 256 soldiers of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave&#x27;s exact location has been a mystery for 240 years.

==Legacy==

The most significant legacy of the Battle of Long Island was that it showed there would be no easy victory, and that the war would be long and bloody. The British took control of the strategically vital harbor and put New York City under military occupation until the treaty ending the war was signed. With the British military command in residence the city became the focal point for espionage and intelligence gathering. The area surrounding the city and the harbor remained in a near-constant state of conflict as a forage-war harassed the surrounding communities.

Commemorations of the battle include:
* The &quot;Altar to Liberty: Minerva&quot; monument: The battle is commemorated with a monument, which includes a bronze statue of Minerva near the top of Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.
* The Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument: A freestanding Doric column in Fort Greene memorializing all those who died while kept prisoner on the British ships just off the shore of Brooklyn, in Wallabout Bay.
* Soldiers&#x27; Monument – Milford, Connecticut. Memorializes the 200 seriously ill prisoners of the Battle of Long Island who were dumped on the beach at Milford the night of January 3, 1777.
* The Old Stone House: A re-constructed farmhouse (c.1699) that was at the center of the Marylanders&#x27; delaying actions serves as a museum of the battle. It is located in J.J. Byrne Park, at Third Street and Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, and features models and maps.
* Prospect Park, Brooklyn, Battle Pass: along the eastern side of East Drive is a large granite boulder with a brass plaque affixed, and another marker lies near the road for the Dongan Oak, a very large and old tree felled to block the pass from the British advance. In addition, in the park resides the Line of Defense marker erected by the Sons of the American Revolution and, near the eastern edge of Long Meadow, the Maryland Monument &amp; Maryland Memorial corinthian column.

There are currently 30 existing units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial and revolutionary eras. Five Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn, 125th MP Co, 175th Inf, 181st Inf and 198th Sig Bn) and one Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1–5th FA) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Long Island.

<doc id="218879" wikidata="Q188741" url="?curid=218879" title="Pleonasm">
<text>Pleonasm (; , ) is redundancy in linguistic expression, such as in &quot;black darkness,&quot; &quot;burning fire,&quot; &quot;the man he said,&quot; or &quot;vibrating with motion.&quot; It is a manifestation of tautology by traditional rhetorical criteria. Pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or because the phrase has become established in a certain form. Tautology and pleonasm are not consistently differentiated in literature.

==Usage==
Most often, &quot;pleonasm&quot; is understood to mean a word or phrase which is useless, clichéd, or repetitive, but a pleonasm can also be simply an unremarkable use of idiom. It can aid in achieving a specific linguistic effect, be it social, poetic or literary. Pleonasm sometimes serves the same function as rhetorical repetition—it can be used to reinforce an idea, contention or question, rendering writing clearer and easier to understand. Pleonasm can serve as a redundancy check; if a word is unknown, misunderstood, misheard, or if the medium of communication is poor—a static-filled radio transmission or sloppy handwriting—pleonastic phrases can help ensure that the meaning is communicated even if some of the words are lost.

===Idiomatic expressions===
Some pleonastic phrases are part of a language&#x27;s idiom, like &quot;tuna fish&quot;, &quot;chain mail&quot; and &quot;safe haven&quot; in American English. They are so common that their use is unremarkable for native speakers, although in many cases the redundancy can be dropped with no loss of meaning.

When expressing possibility, English speakers often use potentially pleonastic expressions such as &quot;It might be possible&quot; or &quot;perhaps it&#x27;s possible&quot;, where both terms (verb &quot;might&quot; or adverb &quot;perhaps&quot; along with the adjective &quot;possible&quot;) have the same meaning under certain constructions. Many speakers of English use such expressions for possibility in general, such that most instances of such expressions by those speakers are in fact pleonastic. Others, however, use this expression only to indicate a distinction between ontological possibility and epistemic possibility, as in &quot;Both the ontological possibility of X under current conditions and the ontological impossibility of X under current conditions are epistemically possible&quot; (in logical terms, &quot;I am not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of proposition X, but I am likewise not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of the negation of X&quot;). The habitual use of the double construction to indicate possibility &quot;per se&quot; is far less widespread among speakers of most other languages (except in Spanish; see examples); rather, almost all speakers of those languages use one term in a single expression:
* French: &#x27; or &#x27;.
* Portuguese: &#x27;, lit. &quot;What is it that&quot;, a more emphatic way of saying &quot;what is&quot;; &#x27; usually suffices.
* Romanian: &#x27; or &#x27;.
* Typical Spanish pleonasms
** – I am going to go up upstairs, &quot;&quot; not being necessary.
** – enter inside, &quot; not being necessary.
* Turkish has many pleonastic constructs because certain verbs necessitate objects:
** – to eat food.
** &quot; – to write writing.
** – to exit outside.
** – to enter inside.
** – to play a game.

In a satellite-framed language like English, verb phrases containing particles that denote direction of motion are so frequent that even when such a particle is pleonastic, it seems natural to include it (e.g. &quot;enter into&quot;).

===Professional and scholarly use===
Some pleonastic phrases, when used in professional or scholarly writing, may reflect a standardized usage that has evolved or a meaning familiar to specialists but not necessarily to those outside that discipline. Such examples as &quot;null and void&quot;, &quot;each and every&quot; are legal doublets that are part of legally operative language that is often drafted into legal documents. A classic example of such usage was that by the Lord Chancellor at the time (1864), Lord Westbury, in the English case of &quot; Gorely&quot;, when he described a phrase in an Act as &quot;redundant and pleonastic&quot;. This type of usage may be favored in certain contexts. However, it may also be disfavored when used gratuitously to portray false erudition, obfuscate, or otherwise introduce verbiage, especially in disciplines where imprecision may introduce ambiguities (such as the natural sciences).

===Literary uses===

Examples from Baroque, Mannerist, and Victorian provide a counterpoint to Strunk&#x27;s advocacy of concise writing:
* &quot;This was the most unkindest cut of all.&quot; — William Shakespeare, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (Act 3, Scene 2, 183)
* &quot;I will be brief: your noble son is mad:/Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,/What is&#x27;t but to be nothing else but mad?&quot; — &quot;Hamlet&quot; (Act 2, Scene 2)
* &quot;Let me tell you this, when social workers offer you, free, gratis and for nothing, something to hinder you from swooning, which with them is an obsession, it is useless to recoil ...&quot; — Samuel Beckett, &quot;Molloy&quot;

==Types==

There are various kinds of pleonasm, including bilingual tautological expressions, syntactic pleonasm, semantic pleonasm and morphological pleonasm:

===Bilingual tautological expressions===
A bilingual tautological expression is a phrase that combines words that mean the same thing in two different languages. An example of a bilingual tautological expression is the Yiddish expression &quot;mayim akhroynem vaser&quot;. It literally means &quot;water last water&quot; and refers to &quot;water for washing the hands after meal, grace water&quot;. Its first element, &quot;mayim&quot;, derives from the Hebrew [&#x27;majim] &quot;water&quot;. Its second element, &quot;vaser&quot;, derives from the Middle High German word &quot;water&quot;.

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, Yiddish abounds with both bilingual tautological compounds and bilingual tautological first names.

The following are examples of bilingual tautological compounds in Yiddish:
* &quot;fíntster khóyshekh&quot; &quot;very dark&quot;, literally &quot;dark darkness&quot;, traceable back to the Middle High German word &quot;&quot; &quot;dark&quot; and the Hebrew word חושך &quot;ħōshekh&quot; &quot;darkness&quot;.
* &quot;khamer-éyzļ&quot; &quot;womanizer&quot;, literally &quot;donkey-donkey&quot;, traceable back to the Hebrew word חמור [ħă&#x27;mōr] &quot;donkey&quot; and the Middle High German word &quot;&quot; &quot;donkey&quot;.

The following are examples of bilingual tautological first names in Yiddish:
* &quot;Dov-Ber&quot;, literally &quot;bear-bear&quot;, traceable back to the Hebrew word &quot;dov&quot; &quot;bear&quot; and the Middle High German word &quot;bear&quot;.
* &quot;Tsvi-Hirsh&quot;, literally &quot;deer-deer&quot;, traceable back to the Hebrew word &quot;tsvi&quot; &quot;deer&quot; and the Middle High German word &quot;deer&quot;.
* &quot;Ze&#x27;ev-Volf&quot;, literally &quot;wolf-wolf&quot;, traceable back to the Hebrew word &quot;ze&#x27;ev&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; and the Middle High German word &quot;wolf&quot;.
* &quot;Aryeh-Leib&quot;, literally &quot;lion-lion&quot;, traceable back to the Hebrew word &quot;arye&quot; &quot;lion&quot; and the Middle High German word &quot;lion&quot;.

Examples occurring in English-language contexts include:
* &quot;River Avon&quot;, literally &quot;River River&quot;, from Welsh.
* &quot;the Sahara Desert&quot;, literally &quot;the The Desert Desert&quot;, from Arabic.
* &quot;the La Brea Tar Pits&quot;, literally &quot;the The Tar Tar Pits&quot;, from Spanish.
* &quot;the Los Angeles Angels&quot;, literally &quot;the The Angels Angels&quot;, from Spanish.
* &quot;the hoi polloi&quot;, literally &quot;the the many&quot;, from Greek.
* &quot;Carmarthen Castle&quot;, may actually have &quot;castle&quot; in it three times: In its Welsh form, &quot;Castell Caerfyrddin&quot;, &quot;Caer&quot; means fort, while &quot;fyrddin&quot; is thought to be derived from the Latin Moridunum (&quot;sea fort&quot;) making Carmarthen Castle &quot;fort sea-fort castle&quot;.
* &quot;Mount Maunganui&quot;, &quot;Lake Rotoroa&quot;, and &quot;Motutapu Island&quot; in New Zealand are &quot;Mount Mount Big&quot;, &quot;Lake Lake Long&quot;, and &quot;Island Sacred Island&quot; respectively, from Māori.
===Syntactic pleonasm===
Syntactic pleonasm occurs when the grammar of a language makes certain function words optional. For example, consider the following English sentences:
* &quot;I know you&#x27;re coming.&quot;
* &quot;I know that you&#x27;re coming.&quot;

In this construction, the conjunction &quot;that&quot; is optional when joining a sentence to a verb phrase with &quot;know&quot;. Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the word &quot;that&quot; is pleonastic in this case. By contrast, when a sentence is in spoken form and the verb involved is one of assertion, the use of &quot;that&quot; makes clear that the present speaker is making an indirect rather than a direct quotation, such that he is not imputing particular words to the person he describes as having made an assertion; the demonstrative adjective &quot;that&quot; also does not fit such an example. Also, some writers may use &quot;that&quot; for technical clarity reasons. In some languages, such as French, the word is not optional and should therefore not be considered pleonastic.

The same phenomenon occurs in Spanish with subject pronouns. Since Spanish is a null-subject language, which allows subject pronouns to be deleted when understood, the following sentences mean the same:
* &quot;

In this case, the pronoun (&#x27;I&#x27;) is grammatically optional; both sentences mean &quot;I love you&quot; (however, they may not have the same tone or &quot;intention&quot;—this depends on pragmatics rather than grammar). Such differing but syntactically equivalent constructions, in many languages, may also indicate a difference in register.

The process of deleting pronouns is called &quot;pro-dropping&quot;, and it also happens in many other languages, such as Korean, Japanese, Hungarian, Latin, Italian, Portuguese, Swahili, Slavic languages, and the Lao language.

In contrast, formal English requires an overt subject in each clause. A sentence may not need a subject to have valid meaning, but to satisfy the syntactic requirement for an explicit subject a pleonastic (or dummy pronoun) is used; only the first sentence in the following pair is acceptable English:
* &quot;It&#x27;s raining.&quot;
* &quot;Is raining.&quot;

In this example the pleonastic &quot;it&quot; fills the subject function, but it contributes no meaning to the sentence. The second sentence, which omits the pleonastic it is marked as ungrammatical although no meaning is lost by the omission. Elements such as &quot;it&quot; or &quot;there&quot;, serving as empty subject markers, are also called (syntactic) expletives, or dummy pronouns. Compare:
* &quot;There is rain.&quot;
* &quot;Today is rain.&quot;

The pleonastic (), expressing uncertainty in formal French, works as follows:
* &quot;(&#x27;I fear it may rain.&#x27;)
* &quot;(&#x27;These ideas are harder to understand than I thought.&#x27;)

Two more striking examples of French pleonastic construction are and .

The word / is translated as &#x27;today&#x27;, but originally means &quot;on the day of today&quot; since the now obsolete means &quot;today&quot;. The expression (translated as &quot;on the day of today&quot;) is common in spoken language and demonstrates that the original construction of is lost. It is considered a pleonasm.

The phrase meaning &#x27;What&#x27;s that?&#x27; or &#x27;What is it?&#x27;, while literally, it means &quot;What is it that it is?&quot;.

There are examples of the pleonastic, or dummy, negative in English, such as the construction, heard in the New England region of the United States, in which the phrase &quot;So don&#x27;t I&quot; is intended to have the same positive meaning as &quot;So do I.&quot;

When Robert South said, &quot;It is a pleonasm, a figure usual in Scripture, by a multiplicity of expressions to signify one notable thing&quot;, he was observing the Biblical Hebrew poetic propensity to repeat thoughts in different words, since written Biblical Hebrew was a comparatively early form of written language and was written using oral patterning, which has many pleonasms. In particular, very many verses of the Psalms are split into two halves, each of which says much the same thing in different words. The complex rules and forms of written language as distinct from spoken language were not as well-developed as they are today when the books making up the Old Testament were written. See also parallelism (rhetoric).

This same pleonastic style remains very common in modern poetry and songwriting (e.g., &quot;Anne, with her father / is out in the boat / riding the water / riding the waves / on the sea&quot;, from Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Street&quot;).

===Semantic pleonasm===
Semantic pleonasm is a question more of style and usage than of grammar. Linguists usually call this &quot;redundancy&quot; to avoid confusion with syntactic pleonasm, a more important phenomenon for theoretical linguistics. It usually takes one of two forms: Overlap or prolixity.

Overlap: One word&#x27;s semantic component is subsumed by the other:
* &quot;Receive a free gift with every purchase.&quot;; a gift is usually already free.
* &quot;A tuna fish sandwich.&quot;
* &quot;The plumber fixed our hot water heater.&quot; (This pleonasm was famously attacked by American comedian George Carlin, but is not truly redundant; a device that increases the temperature of cold water to room temperature would also be a water heater.)
* &quot;The Big Friendly Giant&quot; (title of a children&#x27;s book by Roald Dahl); giants are inherently already &quot;big&quot;.

Prolixity: A phrase may have words which add nothing, or nothing logical or relevant, to the meaning.
* &quot;I&#x27;m going down south.&quot;(South is not really &quot;down&quot;, it is just drawn that way on maps by convention.)
* &quot;You can&#x27;t seem to face up to the facts.&quot;
* &quot;He entered into the room.&quot;
* &quot;Every mother&#x27;s child&quot; (as in &#x27;The Christmas Song&#x27; by Nat King Cole&#x27;, also known as &#x27;Chestnuts roasting...&#x27;). (Being a child, or a human at all, generally implies being the child of/to a mother. So the redundancy here is used to broaden the context of the child&#x27;s curiosity regarding the sleigh of Santa Claus, including the concept of maternity. The full line goes: &quot;And every mother&#x27;s child is gonna spy, to see if reindeer really know how to fly&quot;. One can furthermore argue that the word &quot;mother&quot; is included for the purpose of lyrical flow, adding two syllables, which make the line sound complete, as &quot;every child&quot; would be too short to fit the lyrical/rhyme scheme.)
* &quot;What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.&quot;
* &quot;He raised up his hands in a gesture of surrender.&quot;
* &quot;Where are you at?&quot;
* &quot;Located&quot; or similar before a preposition: &quot;the store is located on Main St.&quot; The preposition contains the idea of locatedness and does not need a servant.
* &quot;The house itself&quot; for &quot;the house&quot;, and similar: unnecessary re-specifiers.
* &quot;Actual fact&quot;: fact.
* &quot;On a daily basis&quot;: daily.
* &quot;This particular item&quot;: this item.
* &quot;Different&quot; or &quot;separate&quot; after numbers: for example:
** &quot;Four different species&quot; are merely &quot;four species&quot;, as two non-different species are together one same species. (However, in &quot;a discount if you buy ten different items&quot;, &quot;different&quot; has meaning, because if the ten items include two packets of frozen peas of the same weight and brand, those ten items are not all different.)
** &quot;Nine separate cars&quot;: cars are always separate.
* &quot;Despite the fact that&quot;: although.

An expression like &quot;tuna fish&quot;, however, might elicit one of many possible responses, such as:
# It will simply be accepted as synonymous with &quot;tuna&quot;.
# It will be perceived as redundant (and thus perhaps silly, illogical, ignorant, inefficient, dialectal, odd, and/or intentionally humorous).
# It will imply a distinction. A reader of &quot;tuna fish&quot; could properly wonder: &quot;Is there a kind of tuna which is not a fish? There is, after all, a dolphin mammal and a dolphin fish.&quot; This assumption turns out to be correct, as a &quot;tuna&quot; can also mean a prickly pear. Further, &quot;tuna fish&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the flesh of the animal as opposed to the animal itself (similar to the distinction between &quot;beef&quot; and &quot;cattle&quot;). Similarly, while all sound-making horns use air, an &quot;air horn&quot; has a special meaning: one that uses &quot;compressed&quot; air specifically; while most clocks tell time, a &quot;time clock&quot; specifically means one that keeps track of workers&#x27; presence at the workplace.
# It will be perceived as a verbal clarification, since the word &quot;tuna&quot; is quite short, and may, for example, be misheard as &quot;tune&quot; followed by an aspiration, or (in dialects that drop the final &quot;-r&quot; sound) as &quot;tuner&quot;.

Careful speakers, and writers, too, are aware of pleonasms, especially with cases such as &quot;tuna fish&quot;, which is normally used only in some dialects of American English, and would sound strange in other variants of the language, and even odder in translation into other languages.

Similar situations are:
* &quot;Ink pen&quot; instead of merely &quot;pen&quot; in the southern United States, where &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;pin&quot; are pronounced similarly.
* &quot;Extra accessories&quot; which must be ordered separately for a new camera, as distinct from the accessories provided with the camera as sold.

Not all constructions that are typically pleonasms are so in all cases, nor are all constructions derived from pleonasms themselves pleonastic:
* &quot;Put that glass over there on the table.&quot; This could, depending on room layout, mean &quot;Put that glass on the table across the room, not the table right in front of you&quot;; if the room were laid out like that, most English speakers would intuitively understand that the distant, not immediate table was the one being referred to; however, if there were only one table in the room, the phrase would indeed be pleonastic. Also, it could mean, &quot;Put that glass on the spot (on the table) which I am gesturing to&quot;; thus, in this case, it is &quot;not&quot; pleonastic.
* &quot;I&#x27;m going way down South.&quot; This may imply &quot;I&#x27;m going much farther south than you might think if I didn&#x27;t stress the southerliness of my destination&quot;; but such phrasing is also sometimes—and sometimes jokingly—used pleonastically when simply &quot;south&quot; would do; it depends upon the context, the intent of the speaker/writer, and ultimately even on the expectations of the listener/reader.

===Subtler redundancies===
In some cases, the redundancy in meaning occurs at the syntactic level above the word, such as at the phrase level:

: &quot;It&#x27;s déjà vu all over again.&quot;
: &quot;I never make predictions, especially about the future.&quot;

The redundancy of these two well-known statements is deliberate, for humorous effect. (See Yogi Berra#&quot;Yogi-isms&quot;.) But one does hear educated people say &quot;my predictions about the future of politics&quot; for &quot;my predictions about politics&quot;, which are equivalent in meaning. While predictions are necessarily about the future (at least in relation to the time the prediction was made), the nature of this future can be subtle (e.g., &quot;I predict that he died a week ago&quot;—the prediction is about future discovery or proof of the date of death, not about the death itself). Generally &quot;the future&quot; is assumed, making most constructions of this sort pleonastic. The latter humorous quote above about not making predictions—by Yogi Berra—is not really a pleonasm, but rather an ironic play on words.
Alternatively it could be an analogy between predict and guess.

However, &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;déjà vu&quot; all over again&quot; could mean that there was earlier another &quot;déjà vu&quot; of the same event or idea, which has now arisen for a third time; or that the speaker had very recently experienced a &quot;déjà vu&quot; of a different idea.

Redundancy, and &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;nonsensical&quot; words (or phrases, or morphemes), can also be inherited by one language from the influence of another and are not pleonasms in the more critical sense but actual changes in grammatical construction considered to be required for &quot;proper&quot; usage in the language or dialect in question. Irish English, for example, is prone to a number of constructions that non-Irish speakers find strange and sometimes directly confusing or silly:
* &quot;I&#x27;m after putting it on the table.&quot;(&#x27;I [have] put it on the table.&#x27;) This example further shows that the effect, whether pleonastic or only pseudo-pleonastic, can apply to words and word-parts, and multi-word phrases, given that the fullest rendition would be &quot;I am after putting it on the table&quot;.
* &quot;Have a look at your man there.&quot;(&#x27;Have a look at that man there.&#x27;) An example of word substitution, rather than addition, that seems illogical outside the dialect. This common possessive-seeming construction often confuses the non-Irish enough that they do not at first understand what is meant. Even &quot;Have a look at that man there&quot; is arguably further doubly redundant, in that a shorter &quot;Look at that man&quot; version would convey essentially the same meaning.
* &quot;She&#x27;s my wife so she is.&quot;(&#x27;She&#x27;s my wife.&#x27;) Duplicate subject and verb, post-complement, used to emphasize a simple factual statement or assertion.

All of these constructions originate from the application of Irish Gaelic grammatical rules to the English dialect spoken, in varying particular forms, throughout the island.

Seemingly &quot;useless&quot; additions and substitutions must be contrasted with similar constructions that are used for stress, humor, or other intentional purposes, such as:
* &quot;I abso-fuckin&#x27;-lutely agree!&quot;(tmesis, for stress)
* &quot;Topless-shmopless—nudity doesn&#x27;t distract me.&quot;(shm-reduplication, for humor)

The latter of these is a result of Yiddish influences on modern English, especially East Coast US English.

Sometimes editors and grammatical stylists will use &quot;pleonasm&quot; to describe simple wordiness. This phenomenon is also called prolixity or logorrhea. Compare:
* &quot;The sound of the loud music drowned out the sound of the burglary.&quot;
* &quot;The loud music drowned out the sound of the burglary.&quot;
or even:
* &quot;The music drowned out the burglary.&quot;

The reader or hearer does not have to be told that loud music has a sound, and in a newspaper headline or other abbreviated prose can even be counted upon to infer that &quot;burglary&quot; is a proxy for &quot;sound of the burglary&quot; and that the music necessarily must have been loud to drown it out, unless the burglary was relatively quiet (this is not a trivial issue, as it may affect the legal culpability of the person who played the music); the word &quot;loud&quot; may imply that the music should have been played quietly if at all. Many are critical of the excessively abbreviated constructions of &quot;headline-itis&quot; or &quot;newsspeak&quot;, so &quot;loud [music]&quot; and &quot;sound of the [burglary]&quot; in the above example should probably not be properly regarded as pleonastic or otherwise genuinely redundant, but simply as informative and clarifying.

Prolixity is also used to obfuscate, confuse, or euphemize and is not necessarily redundant or pleonastic in such constructions, though it often is. &quot;Post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; (shell shock) and &quot;pre-owned vehicle&quot; (used car) are both euphemisms but are not redundant. Redundant forms, however, are especially common in business, political, and academic language that is intended to sound impressive (or to be vague so as to make it hard to determine what is actually being promised, or otherwise misleading). For example: &quot;This quarter, we are presently focusing with determination on an all-new, innovative integrated methodology and framework for rapid expansion of customer-oriented external programs designed and developed to bring the company&#x27;s consumer-first paradigm into the marketplace as quickly as possible.&quot;

In contrast to redundancy, an oxymoron results when two seemingly contradictory words are adjoined.

===Foreign words===

Redundancies sometimes take the form of foreign words whose meaning is repeated in the context:
* &quot;We went to the El Restaurante restaurant.&quot;
* &quot;The&quot; La Brea &quot;tar pits are fascinating.&quot;
* &quot;Roast beef served with &quot;au&quot; &quot;jus&quot; sauce.&quot;
* &quot;Please R.S.V.P.&quot;
* &quot;The Schwarzwald Forest is deep and dark.&quot;
* &quot;The Drakensberg Mountains are in South Africa.&quot;
* &quot;We will vacation in Timor-Leste.&quot;
* LibreOffice office suite.
* The &quot;hoi&quot;&quot; polloi.&quot;
* I&#x27;d like to have a &quot;chai&quot; tea.
* &quot;That delicious Queso cheese.&quot;
* &quot;Some salsa sauce on the side?.&quot;

These sentences use phrases which mean, respectively, &quot;the restaurant restaurant&quot;, &quot;the tar tar&quot;, &quot;with juice sauce&quot; and so on. However, many times these redundancies are necessary—especially when the foreign words make up a proper noun as opposed to a common one. For example, &quot;We went to Il Ristorante&quot; is acceptable provided the audience can infer that it is a restaurant. (If they understand Italian and English it might, if spoken, be misinterpreted as a generic reference and not a proper noun, leading the hearer to ask &quot;Which ristorante do you mean?&quot;—such confusions are common in richly bilingual areas like Montreal or the American Southwest when mixing phrases from two languages.) But avoiding the redundancy of the Spanish phrase in the second example would only leave an awkward alternative: &quot;La Brea pits are fascinating&quot;.

Most people find it best not to drop articles when using proper nouns made from foreign languages:
* &quot;The movie is playing at the El Capitan theater.&quot;

However, there are some exceptions to this, for example:
* &quot;Jude Bellingham plays for Real Madrid in La Liga.&quot; (&quot;La Liga&quot; literally means &quot;The League&quot; in Spanish)

This is also similar to the treatment of definite and indefinite articles in titles of books, films, etc. where the article can—some would say &quot;must&quot;—be present where it would otherwise be &quot;forbidden&quot;:
* &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; is scary.&quot;(Normally, the article would be left off following a possessive.)
* &quot;I&#x27;m having an &quot;An&quot; &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot; movie night at my place.&quot;(Seemingly doubled article, which would be taken for a stutter or typographical error in other contexts.)

Some cross-linguistic redundancies, especially in placenames, occur because a word in one language became the title of a place in another (e.g., the Sahara Desert—&quot;Sahara&quot; is an English approximation of the word for &quot;deserts&quot; in Arabic). &quot;The Los Angeles Angels&quot; professional baseball team is literally &quot;the The Angels Angels&quot;. A supposed extreme example is Torpenhow Hill in Cumbria, where some of the elements in the name likely mean &quot;hill&quot;. See the List of tautological place names for many more examples.

The word &quot;tsetse&quot; means &quot;fly&quot; in the Tswana language, a Bantu language spoken in Botswana and South Africa. This word is the root of the English name for a biting fly found in Africa, the tsetse fly.

===Acronyms and initialisms===

Acronyms and initialisms can also form the basis for redundancies; this is known humorously as RAS syndrome (for Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome). In all the examples that follow, the word after the acronym repeats a word represented in the acronym. The full redundant phrase is stated in the parentheses that follow each example:
* &quot;I forgot my PIN number for the ATM machine.&quot; &quot;(Personal Identification Number number; Automated Teller Machine machine)&quot;
* &quot;I upgraded the RAM memory of my computer.&quot; &quot;(Random Access Memory memory)&quot;
* &quot;She is infected with the HIV virus.&quot; &quot;(Human Immunodeficiency Virus virus)&quot;
* &quot;I have installed a CMS system on my server.&quot; &quot;(Content Management System system)&quot;
* &quot;The SI system of units is the modern form of the metric system.&quot; &quot;(International System system)&quot;

(See RAS syndrome for many more examples.) The expansion of an acronym like PIN or HIV may be well known to English speakers, but the acronyms themselves have come to be treated as words, so little thought is given to what their expansion is (and &quot;PIN&quot; is also pronounced the same as the word &quot;pin&quot;; disambiguation is probably the source of &quot;PIN number&quot;; &quot;SIN number&quot; for &quot;Social Insurance Number number&quot; is a similar common phrase in Canada.) But redundant acronyms are more common with technical (e.g., computer) terms where well-informed speakers recognize the redundancy and consider it silly or ignorant, but mainstream users might not, since they may not be aware or certain of the full expansion of an acronym like &quot;RAM&quot;.

===Apparent redundancies that actually are not redundant===

Carefully constructed expressions, especially in poetry and political language, but also some general usages in everyday speech, may appear to be redundant but are not. This is most common with cognate objects (a verb&#x27;s object that is cognate with the verb):
* &quot;She slept a deep sleep.&quot;

Or, a classic example from Latin:
* &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; = &quot;with change made to what needs to be changed&quot; (an ablative absolute construction)

The words need not be etymologically related, but simply conceptually, to be considered an example of cognate object:
* &quot;We wept tears of joy.&quot;

Such constructions are not actually redundant (unlike &quot;She slept a sleep&quot; or &quot;We wept tears&quot;) because the object&#x27;s modifiers provide additional information. A rarer, more constructed form is polyptoton, the stylistic repetition of the same word or words derived from the same root:
* &quot;...[T]he only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot; — Franklin D. Roosevelt, &quot;First Inaugural Address&quot;, March 1933.
* &quot;With eager feeding[,] food doth choke the feeder.&quot; — William Shakespeare, &quot;Richard II&quot;, II, i, 37.

As with cognate objects, these constructions are not redundant because the repeated words or derivatives cannot be removed without removing meaning or even destroying the sentence, though in most cases they could be replaced with non-related synonyms at the cost of style (e.g., compare &quot;The only thing we have to fear is terror&quot;.)
