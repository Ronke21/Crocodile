<text>Carinthia ( ; ), also Slovene Carinthia or Slovenian Carinthia (&quot;Slovenska Koroška&quot;), is a traditional region in northern Slovenia. The term refers to the small southeasternmost area of the former Duchy of Carinthia, which after World War I was allocated to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. It has no distinct centre, but a local centre in each of the three central river valleys among the heavily forested mountains.

Since the entry of Slovenia into the European Union in May 2004, much effort has been made to re-integrate Carinthia as a cultural, tourism, and economic unit. The historical region has no official status within Slovenia and does not territorially correspond to today&#x27;s Carinthia Statistical Region, but popular identification with Carinthia as an informal province remains common.

==Geography==

The region lies in the Karawanks mountain range of the Southern Limestone Alps and comprises two spatially divided areas totalling :
* the Meža Valley (&quot;Mežiška dolina&quot;) down to the confluence with the Drava Valley (&quot;Dravska dolina&quot;), including the municipalities of Črna na Koroškem, Mežica, Prevalje, Ravne na Koroškem, and Dravograd.
* the Municipality of Jezersko south of the Seeberg Saddle mountain pass. 
All these municipalities border on the Austrian state of Carinthia in the north.

In 2005, the Carinthia Statistical Region was established, which covers a larger area of about , parts of which encompass a number of adjacent municipalities belonging to the traditional region of Styria like the town of Slovenj Gradec in the Mislinja Valley or Muta and Radlje down the Drava River, though not Jezersko, which is part of the Upper Carniola Statistical Region.

The landscape of Carinthia is very diverse, with predominance of hilly and mountainous relief, in the Pleistocene transformed by glaciers. The climate is partially an alpine climate, and partially a transitional continental climate. An important element is temperature inversion. Over two thirds of Carinthia is covered by forest and the percentage is still increasing. The predominant tree species are beech, fir, and spruce. The lower areas have been polluted by lead due to a lead mine. Despite this, Carinthia is home to much game (hare, deer, roe deer) and alpine animal species above the timberline, like at Mount Peca or Mount Raduha. The Drava River is home to many fish.

==History==
The name derives from the early medieval Slavic principality of Carantania, whose territory stretched from the present-day Austrian state of Carinthia down to the Styrian lands on the Sava river. The area was part of the Imperial Carinthian duchy established in 976 and ruled by the House of Habsburg from 1335, which in 1867 became a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria-Hungary. Upon the Austrian defeat in World War I, the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia) in 1919 occupied southern Carinthia. The Meža Valley, the area around Dravograd and Jezersko, which are today the territory of Slovenia, were split off without a referendum, while in the occupied region north and west of this, on 10 October 1920 the voters in the Carinthian Plebiscite determined that those parts should become part of the newly founded First Austrian Republic.

During the 1941 Balkan Campaign of World War II, the area was annexed by Nazi Germany and put under the administration of the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; of Carinthia, led by Friedrich Rainer. Upon the German Instrument of Surrender in May 1945, Yugoslav Partisans entered the region, killing numerous alleged collaborators during the Bleiburg repatriations. The area around Dravograd (Otiški Vrh, Selovec, Bukovska Vas, Šentjanž) and Prevalje (Leše, Poljana) is the site of several mass graves. After the war, the region formed part of the Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Slovenia, it became part of independent Slovenia after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991.

==Demographics==
Carinthia has uneven settlement and a relatively young population. Nonetheless, due to a low birth rate and shorter life span, the number of inhabitants is decreasing. The biggest employer is the processing industry. Many people are commuters, working in Ljubljana, Maribor, Velenje and Austria. In 2008, there was relatively high unemployment, 10.5% in the mining town of Črna na Koroškem and 11.8% in Ravne na Koroškem, known for its steel industry. Other large settlements are the mining towns of Mežica and Prevalje, and Dravograd along the Maribor-Klagenfurt railway.

==Economy==

In the 1990s, the lead and zinc mine in the Meža Valley, the most highly industrialized valley of the region, and the lead smelter in Žerjav were closed down. The only factory in the area around the mine still operating is TAB, a manufacturer of batteries. Metal Ravne, the steel mill at Ravne, which was one of the largest employers in the Duchy of Carinthia in the 19th century, managed to survive and now specializes in alloy steel and machinery components. There are five hydroelectric plants in the Carinthian stretch of the Drava Valley, with a total capacity of about 60 megawatts, and metal products are produced in different places.

==Environment==
After the shut-down of the zinc mine, the extremely poor environmental situation in the narrow Meža Valley with its centuries-long lead and zinc ore exploitation has slowly been improving. However, the entire area of the Slovene Carinthia continues to suffer from severe damage to its forests. In some areas, up to 40% of the trees are damaged due to heavy sulfur dioxide emissions from the Šoštanj Power Plant and the iron works in Ravne.

Despite the pollution of the Meža and Drava rivers, water supply has never been a problem. Clean water is abundant due to the mountainous terrain with its impermeable rock. Almost every farm in the mountains has its own water supply system, and the settlements in the valleys are connected to municipal water supply systems.

==Education and culture==

The Dr. Franc Sušnik Central Carinthian Library and the Carinthian museum are in Ravne na Koroškem, but the Carinthian Regional Museum, the Carinthian Gallery of Fine Arts, and the regional radio station are located in Slovenj Gradec (historically part of Styria). In the past, educational establishments and other activities were dispersed among several small towns. There are high schools in Ravne and Muta. Students who wish to continue their tertiary education mostly choose the universities in Maribor and Ljubljana. In Črna na Koroškem, there is a centre for the protection and vocational education of physically and mentally handicapped youth.

<text>The Battle of Palo Alto () was the first major battle of the Mexican–American War and was fought on May 8, 1846, on disputed ground five miles (8 km) from the modern-day city of Brownsville, Texas. A force of some 3,700 Mexican troops – most of the &quot;Army of The North&quot; – led by General Mariano Arista engaged a force of approximately 2,300 United States troops – the Army of Occupation led by General Zachary Taylor.

On April 30, following the Thornton Affair, Mexican General Mariano Arista&#x27;s troops began to cross the Rio Grande. On May 3, the troops began to besiege the American outpost at Fort Texas. Taylor marched his Army of Occupation south to relieve the siege. Arista, upon learning of his approach, diverted many of his units away from the siege to meet Taylor&#x27;s force. The battle took place on May 8, three days before the formal declaration of war on Mexico by the United States. Arista ordered two cavalry charges, first against the American right flank and later against the left. Both were unsuccessful. The American victory is widely attributed to superior artillery, as the U.S. &quot;light&quot; artillery was much more mobile and accurate than that of the Mexican forces.

That evening, Arista was forced to withdraw further south. The armies clashed again the next day at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma.

==Background==
The Americans ended up ensconced at what came to be known as Fort Brown right across the Rio Grande from Matamoros. On April 24, Arista arrived at Matamoros, having sent General Anastasio Torrejon with a portion of the army across the river to a point a few miles up the river from Matamoros. His plan was to throw troops across the Rio Grande, above and below the positions occupied by the Americans, and advancing to Point Isabel: the base of Taylor’s supply line on the Atlantic Coast, cut off Taylor from his supply line forcing him into an engagement.

After having dispatched Torrejon, Arista marched with the remainder of the troops and twelve pieces of artillery to Longoreño about five leagues east down the river. Leaving Francisco Mejia with only a small garrison in command at Matamoros.

The crossing at Longoreño was long delayed due to a lack of boats thus reducing Arista’s element of surprise, but Taylor was already on to him. The fact that Torrejon had crossed the river and was already further up west was discovered when Captain Thornton and his dragoons who had been sent up the river, fell into an ambuscade and were captured, which came to be known as the Thornton Affair. Later Taylor received intelligence that Mexican forces were preparing to cross the river below his position and not believing that Arista would make a direct assault on his fortified camp, concluded that Point Isabel was the true target.

On May 1, Taylor left his camp well fortified and marched toward Point Isabel which he reached the following day. Meanwhile Arista was crossing the river with his army and received intelligence that Taylor was anticipating his moves. He then gave orders for the batteries at Matamoros to fire upon Fort Brown and sent Pedro de Ampudia with four guns to besiege it. The cannonade began at five in the morning on May 3. Meanwhile Arista united his forces with those of Torrejon and took up a position at Palo Alto east of Point Isabel and North of Fort Brown thus cutting off communications between Fort Brown and Point Isabel. Taylor and his troops however heard the shelling of Fort Brown and Captain Walker was sent with a small cavalry escort to make contact with Fort Brown. By making a very wide turn he evaded Arista and then hid his men in the chaparral making his way alone by night to Fort Brown only to discover that the American troops there were enduring the bombardment with little damage. By the morning of May 5, he was back at Point Isabel with this news.

Taylor now determined to go to the relief of the fort with supplies of ordnance and provisions and on the 7th now set off again for Matamoros with two thousand three hundred men. On May 8 at around noon Taylor’s forces crossed paths with Arista’s forces and both began to prepare for battle.

==Battle==

Facing north and moving left to right, General Arista&#x27;s army consisted of General Antonio Canales Rosillo&#x27;s 400 irregular cavalry in chaparral, Anastasio Torrejon&#x27;s cavalry brigade consisting of the 8th, 7th and Light Cavalry, astride the Point Isabel road, then came General Jose Maria Garcia&#x27;s brigade of the 4th and 10th Infantry with two 8-pounders, then General Rómulo Díaz de la Vega&#x27;s brigade of the 10th and 6th Infantry with five 4-pounders, then the Tampico Corps, the 2d Light Infantry and a sapper battalion with a 4-pounder. Behind this line was Col. Cayetano Montero&#x27;s light cavalry.

Facing south and moving right to left, Taylor, with a force of 2,300 men and 400 wagons, placed Col. David E. Twiggs with Lt. Col. James S. McIntosh&#x27;s 5th Infantry and Maj. Samuel Ringgold&#x27;s artillery battery, followed by Capt. Lewis N. Morris&#x27; 3d Infantry with Lt. William H. Churchill&#x27;s two 18-pounders astride the road, followed by Capt. George W. Allen&#x27;s 4th Infantry, Lt. Thomas Childs&#x27; artillery battalion, Lt. Col. William G. Belknap&#x27;s wing, James Duncan&#x27;s battery, then Capt. William R. Montgomery&#x27;s 8th Infantry on the American left. Lt. Col. Charles A. May&#x27;s dragoon squadron guarded the left flank and Capt. Croghan Ker guarded the train. Montgomery was slightly wounded during the battle, along with approximately ten other officers, some of them severely.
Taylor halted his columns and formed a line behind his batteries when the Mexican artillery started firing at 2 pm central daylight time. The American artillery was very effective while the Mexican artillery often fell short. Arista ordered Torrejon&#x27;s cavalry to attack the American right, but progress was slow, allowing Twiggs to form the 5th Infantry into a square to meet them with a couple of volleys.

A fire started from a cannon burning wad which halted fighting for an hour as the smoke paralleled between the lines of the opposing forces. Arista pulled back 1,000 yards on his left and Taylor advanced accordingly, rotating the axis of the battle 40 degrees counterclockwise. May failed to turn the Mexican left before the artillery duel resumed. Child&#x27;s artillery battalion formed a square to repel another Torrejon cavalry charge. Duncan&#x27;s battery stopped Arista from turning the American left and then advanced with the 8th Infantry and Ker&#x27;s dragoons to drive the Mexican right from the field. A charge ordered by Arista at this time resulted in the light cavalry fleeing along the Mexican line, taking the 6th Infantry with them. Fighting stopped with dusk and both armies camped for the night.

==Aftermath==
The morning of the 9th revealed the Mexican army slowly moving south. Taylor sent forward a 220-man battalion under McCall to reconnoiter the Mexican positions. The Battle of Resaca de la Palma would follow.

Major Ringgold was struck by a cannon ball and mortally wounded during the battle. But Ringgold&#x27;s and Duncan&#x27;s effective cannoneers with their &quot;Flying Artillery&quot;—the tactic of using light artillery to attack then quickly move to another location and fire once more—carried the day and won the battle for the Americans. General Zachary Taylor emerged from the war a national hero.

The battlefield is now Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park and is maintained by the National Park Service.

The State of Iowa named its counties soon after the battle, and several Iowa counties are named in honor of the battle and its participants, including Palo Alto, Ringgold, Page, and Taylor. The city of Palo, Iowa, was also named for the battle.

==Fort Polk==
Zachary Taylor established Fort Polk, near Point Isabel, 23 miles northeast of present day Brownsville, with a Gulf of Mexico pass suitable for ships&#x27; landings, on March 24, 1846, as a supply base for his operations leading up to the Battle of Palo Alto, and used it until 1850. He garrisoned it with two artillery companies under Major John Munroe. Major Charles Thomas was the Depot Quartermaster using wagons and river steamers to supply Taylor.

Taylor established camps for those heeding his call for volunteers at Point Isabel, the north end of Brazos Island, and along the Rio Grande between Barita and Fort Brown, at a place known as Camp Belknap.

<text>Flag football is a variant of gridiron football (American football or Canadian football depending on location) where, instead of tackling players to the ground, the defensive team must remove a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier (&quot;deflagging&quot;) to end a down. In flag football, contact is limited between players. The sport has a strong amateur following with several national and international competitions each year sponsored by various associations but is most popularly played in America where it was invented. The international governing body for the sport is the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) with the International Woman&#x27;s Flag Football Association (IWFFA) governing the women&#x27;s game.

Flag football will be a discretionary event for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the first time any gridiron football code has been a full part of an Olympic programme.

==History==
The best available records to date point to the early 1940s during World War II as the sport&#x27;s starting point. The game began as a recreational sport created for American military personnel to help them stay fit but was designed in a way that would help prevent them from becoming injured during wartime. At the time it was called &quot;Touch and Tail football&quot;, which then became &quot;flag football&quot; after the war ended.

The first known recorded history of flag football can be traced to Fort Meade, Maryland, USA, which is now generally accepted as the sport&#x27;s birthplace. The first national flag football organization, the National Touch Football League, was formed in the 1960s in St. Louis, Missouri. Since 1971, the league has had a national championship game.

Arizona teachers Porter Wilson and Norman Adams invented flag-a-tag belts and flags which are the template for the flags used in the game today.

==Basic rules==
The specific rules of flag football vary widely by league, though all share in common their replication of the rules of traditional American football with tackling replaced by flag-pulling.

Traditional American football rules are often eliminated or modified to reflect the more recreational nature of the game, the desire to avoid physical contact and injury, and the generally smaller number of participating players per side.

In a standard game of flag football, the match is played in two halves. Time length is determined by the league being played. The clock only stops for injuries, half-time and timeouts.

==Variations==

Chiefly, because there is no dominant sanctioning organization for the sport, the game has mutated into many variations: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 players on each side; coed or single-gender; with kicking and punting and with point-after conversions (including some with 1, 2, and 3 point tries) or without; and field sizes that vary from full Canadian Football League (CFL) size, National Football League (NFL) size (120 yards long by 53 yards wide), to fields a third that size.

An important distinction is whether linemen are allowed to catch passes (&quot;Eligible Linemen&quot;) or, as in the NFL / CFL, are not allowed to do so (&quot;Ineligible Linemen&quot;). Flag (and touch) football may also be divided into &quot;contact&quot; or &quot;non-contact&quot;, depending on whether or not blocking is allowed; if allowed, blocking is usually restricted to the chest.

The ability or inability of the quarterback to advance the ball past the line of scrimmage (LOS) by running is another rule subject to variation by the league.

The sport is also played on surfaces other than a traditional grass football field, including on sand beaches; beach flag football has previously featured as a discipline at the Asian Beach Games.

== International tournaments ==

=== IFAF Flag Football World Championship ===

The International Federation of American Footbal (IFAF) organise a biannual IFAF Flag Football World Championship.

=== Olympics ===

In July 2022, the National Football League (NFL) and the IFAF partnered on a bid for flag football to be included as an optional event during the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The NFL had sponsored the inclusion of flag football as an invitational event during that month&#x27;s 2022 World Games—a multi-sport event featuring sports and disciplines not currently contested at the Olympics—in Birmingham, Alabama. The men&#x27;s tournament was won by the United States, and the women&#x27;s tournament by Mexico. The NFL&#x27;s executive VP of football operations Troy Vincent stated that the sport was &quot;the future of American football&quot;, as it was inclusive and had fewer barriers to access.

In August 2022, flag football was shortlisted as one of nine sports advancing to the next phase of the bid process. On October 9, 2023, the LA organizing committee officially proposed the inclusion of flag football as an event. On October 16, 2023, flag football and the organizing committee&#x27;s other proposals for temporary events were approved at the 141st IOC Session.

=== World Games ===

The 2022 World Games marked the 40th anniversary of the event, which took place from July 7–17, 2022. Hosted at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama, Flag Football featured eight men&#x27;s teams and eight women&#x27;s teams from around the world. In 2021 the World Games uploaded a beginner&#x27;s guide to World Games Flag Football.

As the reigning world champions, the United States men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams both pre-qualified for the 2022 World Games. The remaining seven teams were selected through the IFAF qualifying process

===International Flag Football Festival===
The International Flag Football Festival (IFFF) organizes the World Cup of Flag Football featuring teams from the United States, Mexico and several other nations.

=== Kelly McGillis Classic ===
The Kelly McGillis Classic is a women&#x27;s tournament organised by the IWFFA held each February in Key West, Florida where over 90 women and girls teams participate in 8-on-8, semi-blocking contact flag football.

==United States==
=== USA Football ===
USA Football is the governing body of American football in the United States, the sole US member of the International Federation of American Football, and a recognized sports organization of the US Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee. Its non-profit mission includes designing and delivering premier educational, development, and competitive programs for American football, including tackle and flag football. USA Football is the only organization that selects and organizes the U.S. national team (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) in federation-sanctioned international competition.

=== USA Flag ===
USA Flag currently operates the largest National Championships flag football tournament in the United States, along with a club World Championships every January in Florida that eclipsed over 980 teams this past January 2023, the largest single weekend flag football tournament ever recorded. The USA Flag has grown exponentially each year.

=== NFL Flag ===
The National Football League and its teams have promoted and sponsored flag football leagues in the United States as a youth sport under the branding NFL Flag; in 2020, Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson became a chairman and co-owner of NFL Flag, as part of efforts by the NFL to expand its promotion of the sport into other territories. The program has also placed a particular focus on expanding women&#x27;s flag football, due to gridiron football having predominantly been played by men.

In 2023, as part of a retooling of the Pro Bowl—the NFL&#x27;s all-star event—into a series of skills competitions, culminating with three flag football games as the final events. In 2023 and 2024, NFL Flag also hosted its world championships as part of the Pro Bowl festivities. In February 2025 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the NFL was considering launching a pro Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s flag football league, while a source with knowledge of the league stated to ProFootballTalk that Goodell statement was an &quot;understatement&quot; and that work on the proposed league is &quot;vary much underway.

===American Flag Football League===
The American Flag Football League (AFFL) is a flag football organization that offers youth and women&#x27;s competition, and in 2023, a men&#x27;s professional division.

=== Varsity flag football ===
In May 2020, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), in partnership with the NFL, announced the addition of flag football as a varsity sport for female student-athletes. The NAIA became the first collegiate governing body to sanction the sport at the varsity level. NAIA women&#x27;s flag football began during the 2020–21 season as an emerging sport with at least 15 teams, and the NAIA and NFL also expected an upgrade of the sport to an invitational level sport by 2022 with at least 25 teams.

In May 2022, the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) announced that it would sponsor flag football as an emerging women&#x27;s sport, starting in 2023.

In June 2023, the Atlantic East Conference of NCAA Division III announced five of its seven member institutions would independently sponsor women&#x27;s flag football in the spring of 2025, with support from the NFL and the Philadelphia Eagles. In July 2024, Conference Carolinas of NCAA Division II announced that six of its 16 member schools would sponsor women&#x27;s flag football, starting in the spring of 2026.

== Canada ==

===Canadian Flag Football League===
The Canadian Flag Football League (CFFL) was established in 2019 and runs Canada&#x27;s CFFL National Championship. The league is affiliated with Football Canada, the national governing body for football in Canada and its variants. The winners of the CFFL National Championship also gain the opportunity to represent Canada in international competition.

The league&#x27;s major objective is to help integrate existing adult flag leagues on a nationwide basis. Depending on the region, teams compete in their Regional Championships, either Eastern, Western, or Central. The top two teams from each division advance to the national championship.

There are three divisions for the CFFL: male, female, and mixed.

==== Flag Football National Championships ====

The Canadian Flag Football National Championships (FFNC) was established in 2007 to provide athletes with the opportunity to develop their skills and compete in national team competitions and eventually the Canadian Flag Football League (CFFL) which was established in 2019. Since its inception, the format of the championship has undergone several changes.

In 2011, in response to the growth of flag football and the development of Football Canada&#x27;s Long-Term Athlete Development (LTAD) model, the under-15 co-ed division was replaced by separate boys and girls under-16 divisions. These divisions supplemented the pre-existing under-18 divisions that were added in 2010.

By 2013, the championship featured three divisions: male and female under-16 divisions and a female under-18 division.

In 2017, with the introduction of the Under-16 Regional Flag Challenge, the championship shifted to an under-18 format with male and female divisions.

== United Kingdom ==
Flag football competition in the United Kingdom is, mostly, 5-a-side. There are two main organizations: The adult-only Outlaw Flag League, which run Tournaments from March to October, culminating in playoff and championships. Secondly, the NFFL, The National Flag Football League, organized by The British American Football Association (BAFA). At a senior level, there are sixty teams divided into two leagues. NFL Division One: Highlands, North A, North B, Midlands, South East, and South West and The Premiership: Highlands, North, South East, and South West, with the top teams qualifying for playoffs at the end of the season. BAFA also runs The Youth Flag Football League (YFFL) and organizes teams competing at under 17, under 14, and under 11. Flag football games in the UK are played with five players on each side with no contact, and are officiated according to the IFAF flag football rules with a few minor variations. The U17s and U14s, and, for the 2023 season U11s, compete in the National Youth Flag Football League, which runs from April to August, with teams playing in Local and regional tournaments to qualify for National Finals Day and ultimately be crowned National Champions.

<text>Styria ( ; ; ; ) is an Austrian state in the southeast of the country. With an area of approximately , Styria is Austria&#x27;s second largest state, after Lower Austria. It is bordered to the south by Slovenia, and clockwise, from the southwest, by the other Austrian states of Carinthia, Salzburg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and Burgenland. The state&#x27;s capital is Graz, the second largest city in Austria after only Vienna.

==Name==
The March of Styria derived its name from the original seat of its ruling Otakar dynasty: Steyr, in today&#x27;s Upper Austria, which in turn derives its name from the namesake river of Steyr, stemming from the Celtic Stiria. In the native German the area is still called &quot;Steiermark&quot;, while in English the Latin name &quot;Styria&quot; is used. Until the late 19th century however, the German name &quot;Steyer&quot;, a slightly modernized spelling of Steyr, was also common. The ancient link between the city of Steyr and Styria is also apparent in their nearly identical coats of arms, a white Panther on a green background. Styria is also popularly known as the &quot;Green March&quot;, owing to it being the most forested of all the Austrian states, or as the &quot;Iron Margraviate&quot; for its long heritage of manufacturing and engineering.

==Geography==
* The term &quot;Upper Styria&quot; () refers to the northern and northwestern parts of the federal state (districts Liezen, Murau, Murtal, Leoben, Bruck-Mürzzuschlag). The districts of Leoben and Bruck-Mürzzuschlag are also called &quot;High Styria&quot; (Hochsteiermark).
* The term &quot;Western Styria&quot; (&quot;Weststeiermark&quot;) is used for the districts west of Graz (Voitsberg, Deutschlandsberg, western part of the district Leibnitz). Because of the similar landscape with hills, valleys, wine and culture, the region in western Styria is also called &quot;Styrian Tuscany&quot;.
* The districts east of Graz (Weiz, Hartberg-Fürstenfeld, and Südoststeiermark) are referred to as &quot;Eastern Styria&quot; (&quot;Oststeiermark&quot;).
The western and eastern parts of the district Graz-Umgebung (literally, &quot;Graz-surroundings&quot;) may or may not be considered parts of West and East Styria, respectively. The southern fourth of the historic Duchy of Styria, which after World War I became part of Yugoslavia and later Slovenia (except for World War II), was (and sometimes colloquially still is) referred to as &quot;Lower Styria&quot; (&quot;Untersteiermark&quot;; ).

==History==


Styria was inhabited by Celtic tribes. After its conquest by the Romans, the eastern part of what is now Styria was part of Pannonia, while the western one was included in Noricum. During the Barbarian invasions, it was conquered or crossed by the Visigoths, the Huns, the Ostrogoths, the Rugii, and the Lombards. Slavs under the domination of the Avars settled in the valleys around 600. At the same time, Bavarians under Frankish domination began to expand their area to the south and east, ultimately absorbing the Slavic population.

Under the Otakar dynasty, Styria was made into a margraviate in 1056 and in 1180, also separated from the Duchy of Carinthia to become a Duchy of its own; Per the Georgenberg Pact, the Austrian Duke Leopold V also became Duke of Styria in 1192. After the demise of the Babenberg dynasty (to which Leopold belonged), Styria came briefly under the control of Hungary and later Bohemia. During this time, it lost vast parts of its territory, including the former capital Steyr (which would later form a significant part of the emerging &quot;Duchy of Austria above the Enns&quot; or Upper Austria), as well as Pitten (now the southeastern part of Lower Austria). When the Habsburgs reunified Austria in 1282, Pitten was returned to Styria until the 16th century when Austria finally annexed it. During this time, Styria formed the central part of Inner Austria.

Styria developed economically under Archduke John of Austria, the so-called &quot;Styrian Prince&quot;, between 1809 and 1859.

In 1918, after World War I, the Duchy of Styria was partitioned broadly along ethnic lines (, though where mixed, the defeated Austrian side lost the lands in question to Yugoslavia, such as the majority German-speaking Abstall basin,) into a northern part, constituting the Austrian state of Styria, as well as the continuation of the Styrian state altogether, and a southern one, traditionally called Lower Styria, though Lower Styria does not exist as any political entity and is only a traditional term. As a result of the turbulence of two world wars, the German-speaking population of Lower Styria, which had mainly been concentrated in the cities, particularly the so-called &quot;Festungsdreieck&quot; (fortress-triangle) of Maribor (Marburg an der Drau), Celje (Cilli) and Ptuj (Pettau) migrated from the region or was expelled.

==Economy==
The federal state&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) was 49.6 billion € in 2018, accounting for 12.9% of Austria&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 35,400 € or 118% of the EU27 average in the same year.

In 2004, Styria had the strongest economic growth rate in Austria at 3.8%—mainly due to the Graz area, which saw strong economic growth that year and has continued to grow in economic and population terms since then.

Styria is home to more than 150 clean technology companies of which one dozen are world technology leaders in their field. The revenue of Styrian cleantech companies totals €2.7 billion. This equals 8 percent of the gross regional product (GRP) and is one of the highest concentrations of leading clean technology companies in Europe. The companies have an average (real) growth rate of 22 percent per year—well above the worldwide cleantech market growth of 18 percent per year. The region created roughly 2,000 additional green jobs in 2008 alone.

The Formula One Austrian Grand Prix has been held in the region, first at the Zeltweg Airfield in 1964 and then at the Osterreichring from 1970 to 1987. The sport returned to the circuit, now redesigned and rebranded as the A1-Ring, from 1997 to 2003. Formula One once again returned to the circuit, now renamed the Red Bull Ring, in 2014 and has been held at the track every year since. The COVID-19 pandemic saw the 2020 Formula One calendar massively revised, resulting in the Red Bull Ring becoming the first circuit to host consecutive Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, with the first round running under the Austrian Grand Prix name and the second held as the Styrian Grand Prix. This continued in 2021.

==Administrative divisions==
The federal state is divided into 13 districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), one of them a statutory city. There are 286 municipalities.

==Politics==
The federal state had been a stronghold of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) since 1945. Graz is markedly more left-wing than the rural districts of the federal state.

The governor (Austrian political term: &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;) of Styria was, except from 2005 until 2015 and since 2024, always a ÖVP politican. 

In the 2021 municipal election in Graz, the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) surprisingly took over first place from the ÖVP, thus pushing long-time mayor Siegfried Nagl (ÖVP) out of office. The result was noted internationally. Elke Kahr led the KPÖ for a third time in the 2021 Graz local election. Despite opinion polling suggesting a victory for the ruling ÖVP, the KPÖ became the largest party with 28.8% of votes and 15 seats. After the election, the KPÖ entered into coalition talks with The Greens – The Green Alternative and the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ). On November 13, 2021, the KPÖ, the Greens and the SPÖ announced their coalition: Graz gets a communist mayor with Elke Kahr. 

===Recent elections===
In the 2005 elections for the federal state&#x27;s parliament the SPÖ under their regional chairman Franz Voves won the majority after the ÖVP had damaged its credibility through scandals and the secession of a high-ranking party member, who took part in the 2005 elections after setting up his own party. In these elections, the KPÖ also received many votes after it had gained much popularity through its role in local politics in Graz during the preceding years. The two right-wing populist parties, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), failed to win seats.

In subsequent elections in 2010 and 2015, the SPÖ, the ÖVP, and the KPÖ each lost between one fourth and one third of their shares of the vote relative to 2005. The FPÖ grew from 4.6 percent to 26.8 percent.

In the last state election in 2024, the far-right Freedom Party reached first place for the first time with 34.8 percent of the vote. The current government of Styria is a coalition of FPÖ and ÖVP. The governor, Mario Kunasek, is a representative of the FPÖ. His deputy, Manuela Khom, is a ÖVP member.

<text>Christopher Carl Carter (born October 13, 1956) is an American television and film producer, director and writer. Born in Bellflower, California, Carter graduated with a degree in journalism from California State University, Long Beach before spending thirteen years working for &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot;. After beginning his television career working on television films for Walt Disney Studios, Carter rose to fame in the 1990s for creating the Fox science fiction supernatural drama series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The show earned high viewership ratings, and eventually led to Carter&#x27;s being able to negotiate the creation of future series.

Carter has his own television production company, Ten Thirteen Productions, wherein he went on to create three more series for the network—&quot;Millennium&quot;, a doomsday-themed series which met with critical approval and low viewer numbers; &quot;Harsh Realm&quot;, which was canceled after three episodes had aired; and &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The X-Files&quot; which lasted for a single season. Carter&#x27;s film roles include writing both of &quot;The X-Files&quot;″ cinematic spin-offs—1998&#x27;s successful &quot;The X-Files&quot; and the poorly received 2008 follow-up &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, the latter of which he also directed—while his television credits have earned him several accolades including eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

==Early life==
Chris Carter was born on October 13, 1956, in Bellflower, California. His father worked in the construction industry. Carter has described his childhood as &quot;fairly normal&quot;, and was fond of both Little League Baseball and surfing; his surfing stance is goofy footed. He attended California State University, Long Beach in Long Beach, graduated with a journalism degree in 1979. An avid surfer, he began writing for &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot;, a San Clemente-based journal, eventually becoming its editor at the age of 28. Carter would work for the magazine for thirteen years, and credits his tenure there for teaching him how to run a business. It was also at this time that Carter began taking an interest in pottery, making &quot;hundreds of thousands of pieces&quot; of dinnerware as a hobby. He has compared the process of making pottery to Zen meditations, although he has since thrown out most of his work.

==Personal life==

In 1983, Carter began dating Dori Pierson, whom he had met through a cousin of hers who worked with him at &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot;. The couple were married in 1987, and live in Santa Barbara.

==Career==

===Starting in television===
Pierson&#x27;s connections at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter on a standard contract. Carter began writing television films for the studio, penning &quot;The B.R.A.T. Patrol&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Meet the Munceys&quot; in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.

Carter met the then-president of NBC, Brandon Tartikoff, at a company softball game in Brentwood, California. Tartikoff and Carter began talking between innings, and when Tartikoff eventually read some of Carter&#x27;s script work, he brought him over to write for the network. There, Carter developed a number of unproduced television pilots—&quot;Cameo By Night&quot;, featuring Sela Ward; &quot;Brand New Life&quot;, which has been described as being similar to &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;; &quot;Copter Cop&quot;, a science fiction series that was hampered by Tartikoff&#x27;s injuries after a car accident; and &quot;Cool Culture&quot;, influenced by Carter&#x27;s passion for surfing and experience with &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot;. During this time Carter would also work as a producer on &quot;Rags to Riches&quot;, a job he accepted in order to learn more about producing a series.

Peter Roth, at that time the president of Stephen J. Cannell Productions, obtained a copy of Carter&#x27;s pilot script for &quot;Cool Culture&quot;, and although the series was never picked up, Roth was interested in hiring Carter to work on the CBS series &quot;Palace Guard&quot;. However, Roth would soon leave Cannell Productions to work for Fox as the head of its television production wing. Carter was among the first wave of new staff hired by Roth in 1992 to develop material for the network, and he began work on a series based on his own childhood fondness for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;The X-Files&quot; and success===

Carter&#x27;s new series would take its stylistic inspiration from &quot;Kolchak&quot;, while thematically reflecting his experiences growing up during the Watergate scandal. Carter also drew inspiration from his friend John E. Mack&#x27;s survey of American beliefs in ufology, which indicated that of the population believed they had been abducted by aliens. Roth warmed to the idea upon hearing of the influence of &quot;Kolchak&quot;, believing that vampires—one of the central antagonists of the original series—would be popular with audiences given the interest being shown in the upcoming film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, although Carter insisted on an extraterrestrial-focused series. However, Carter had never been interested in science fiction before this point, professing to have briefly read one novel each by Ursula K. Le Guin and Robert A. Heinlein. Basing his characters instead on those found in the English television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Carter took an eighteen-page treatment for his new project—by now titled &quot;The X-Files&quot;—to a pitch meeting at Fox, where it was soon rejected. With the help of Roth, Carter was able to arrange a second pitch meeting, at which the network reluctantly agreed to greenlight a pilot for the series.

After finding the series&#x27; two starring leads in Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, Carter was given a budget of to produce a pilot episode. The series aired on Friday nights on the Fox network, being broadcast in tandem with &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; in what was perceived to be an unpopular timeslot. The series earned relatively impressive Nielsen ratings for its Friday timeslot, and was given a full twenty-four episode order. The series&#x27; popularity and critical acclaim built over the course of its second and third seasons, and saw it earning its first Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and breaking the record for highest price paid by a network for rights to air re-runs, fetching $600,000 per episode from Fox&#x27;s sister network FX. After Carter&#x27;s initial three-year signing for Fox had ended, the success of the series allowed him to negotiate a five-year contract with several additional perks, including the guarantee of a feature film adaptation to be produced by the parent company&#x27;s film studio, and the greenlighting of Carter&#x27;s next television project. In March 2015, it was confirmed that Carter was set to executive produce and write for the revival of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which was set for a six-episode event series. In 2017 it was announced that The X-Files would return to Fox with a ten-episode season 11, with Carter set to executive produce and write. Both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny returned, as well as veteran writers Glen Morgan, Darin Morgan, and Jim Wong, and newcomers Gabe Rotter, Benjamin Van Allen, and Brad Follmer. The eleventh season has received generally positive if somewhat lukewarm reviews from critics, but ratings fell dramatically, and Gillian Anderson has stated she will not play Scully again.

In August 2020, Fox announced that an animated comedy spin-off series was in development.

In October 2020, Chris Carter said: &quot;I always thought there would be even more &quot;X-Files&quot;.&quot; He admitted that continuing the series at this point with Duchovny and Anderson is unlikely, but has plans to continue the franchise with an upcoming animated spinoff. &quot;Being that Gillian has decided to move on with her career, we certainly couldn&#x27;t do Mulder and Scully again. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t another way to do &quot;The X-Files&quot;. And so right now I think the future is unwritten.&quot; The rights are now owned by Disney.

===&quot;Millennium&quot;===
Carter began work on a new series, &quot;Millennium&quot;. The genesis of this new project stemmed from &quot;Irresistible&quot;, a second-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; which Carter had written, which focused on a sexually motivated serial killer with none of that series&#x27; usual supernatural trappings. Carter fleshed out the basis of the new show&#x27;s protagonist, Frank Black, and travelled to Seattle for inspiration for a new setting. Influence was also drawn from the works of Nostradamus, and the increasing popular interest in eschatology ahead of the coming millennium. The central role of Black was eventually filled by Lance Henriksen, and the series began airing in the Friday timeslot formerly occupied by &quot;The X-Files&quot;. &quot;Pilot&quot;, the début episode, was heavily promoted by Fox, and brought in over a quarter of the total audience during its broadcast.

The series also attracted a high degree of critical appraisal, earning a People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Favorite New TV Dramatic Series&quot; in its first year. At the beginning of the second season, Carter handed over control of the series to Glen Morgan and James Wong, with whom he had previously worked on both &quot;Millennium&quot; first season and several seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Despite its promising start, however, ratings for &quot;Millennium&quot; after the pilot remained consistently low, and it was cancelled after three seasons.

===Feature films===
During the production of the fourth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, work on the first feature film adaptation of the series began. Also titled &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Carter initially began a treatment for the script over Christmas holidays in Hawaii in 1996. Series producer Frank Spotnitz collaborated on the story outline at this time. Carter would later return to Hawaii for a ten-day stint in 1997 to begin fleshing out the finished script. Carter appointed frequent series director Rob Bowman as director of the film, which went on to feature many of the series&#x27; regular cast, including Duchovny, Anderson, Mitch Pileggi and William B. Davis.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; premiered on June 19, 1998, eventually making a worldwide gross of $189 million, and received mixed reviews.

Ten years after the success of the first film, and six years after &quot;The X-Files&quot; final season had finished, Carter would both write and direct a second feature film, titled &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;. Filmed in British Columbia, &quot;I Want To Believe&quot; was released on July 25, 2008; eventually grossing $68,369,434 worldwide. The film received generally negative reviews from critics.

===Other work===
Carter has had several brief cameo roles as an actor — first appearing in &quot;The X-Files&quot;″ &quot;Anasazi&quot; as an FBI agent; before portraying a member of a film audience in &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot;, a later episode of the same series. Carter also made a brief appearance in &quot;Three Men and a Smoking Diaper&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;.

In 1999, Carter began adapting the comic book series &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; as a television show. Carter&#x27;s friend and frequent collaborator Daniel Sackheim had optioned the comics for adaptation in 1996. However, when the series first aired on October 8, 1999, the comics&#x27; writers Andrew Paquette and James Hudnall were given no writing credits for the work; the two then filed suit against Fox to be credited for their work. &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; received disappointing viewing figures, and was cancelled after only three episodes had been broadcast.

Two years later, Carter launched a spin-off of &quot;The X-Files&quot; titled &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, a series centred on three minor characters from the former series. &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; was cancelled after thirteen episodes, later receiving a coda in the form of a crossover episode with &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Carter has since been involved with writing and directing the as-yet unreleased film &quot;Fencewalker&quot;, set to feature Natalie Dormer and Katie Cassidy. In 2011, he began working to develop &quot;Unique&quot;, a police thriller television series; the project was eventually dropped before completion.

Carter next began work on the Amazon Studios television series &quot;The After&quot;. The pilot episode was made available for viewing on February 6, 2014; the series was green-lit the following month, but finally cancelled on January 5, 2015, without another episode beyond the pilot being shot.

=== Influences ===
As well as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&quot;, Carter has spoken about the influence on his work of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (both the Whale film and the Mary Shelley novel), &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), Spielberg films (specifically citing &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Munich&quot;), and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, about which he has said, &quot;I could have watched that show every night of the week, that&#x27;s how much I loved it.&quot;

In addition to these cultural sources, Carter has spoken about the impact that witnessing the hypnosis, by John Mack, of an alleged abductee, and meeting alleged abductees and UFO witnesses in general, had upon his work writing &quot;The X-Files&quot;: &quot;When I was writing about the phenomenon, it wasn’t as a disbeliever – it was as a person who wanted to believe.&quot;

==Accolades==
Carter&#x27;s work has earned him several accolades over his career, including eight nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards. Carter has also received award nominations for the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Edgar Awards, and the British Academy Television Awards.

Danes first gained recognition for starring in the 1994 teen drama series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and receiving a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She made her film debut in the same year in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), and gained wider fame for starring in the romance &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996). Danes has since appeared in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; (1999), &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003), &quot;Shopgirl&quot; (2005), and &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007). She appeared in an Off-Broadway production of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in 2000 and made her Broadway debut playing Eliza Doolittle in a 2007 revival of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.
In 2010, Danes portrayed the title character in the HBO film &quot;Temple Grandin&quot; for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. From 2011 to 2020, she starred as Carrie Mathison in the Showtime drama series &quot;Homeland&quot;, for which she won two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series. In 2022, she starred in the FX on Hulu series &quot;Fleishman Is in Trouble&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Claire Catherine Danes was born April 12, 1979 in Manhattan, New York City, the daughter of sculptor and printmaking artist Carla Danes (née Hall), and photographer Christopher Danes. Her older brother, Asa, is a lawyer. During Danes&#x27;s childhood, her mother ran a small toddler day care center called &quot;Danes Tribe&quot; out of the family&#x27;s SoHo loft, and later she served as Danes&#x27;s manager. Danes&#x27;s father worked as a residential general contractor in New York for 20 years in a company he ran called &quot;Overall Construction&quot;. He also worked as a photographer and computer consultant. Danes is named after her paternal grandmother, Claire Danes (née Tomowske). Danes describes her ethnic origins as &quot;WASPy as you can get&quot;.

The family lived in an artist&#x27;s loft on Crosby Street. Danes attended P.S. 3 and P.S. 11 for elementary school and Professional Performing Arts School for junior high school. She attended the New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies in Manhattan, where her future &quot;Homeland&quot; co-star Morena Baccarin and she were classmates. She attended The Dalton School for one year of high school before moving with her parents to Santa Monica, California, for the role in &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. They moved two days after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Danes graduated from the Lycée Français de Los Angeles in 1997. In 1998, she began studies at Yale University. After studying for two years as a psychology major, she dropped out to focus on her film career.

Danes started studying dance when she was six years old. She took dance classes from Ellen Robbins at Dance Theater Workshop and acting classes at HB Studio the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute at the age of 10, and appeared in theater and video productions in New York City. Although she continued to dance, Danes said that her focus shifted to acting by the time she was nine years old. 

Her audition with Miloš Forman when she was 11 led to roles in several student films. She signed with agent Karen Friedman at the Writers &amp; Artists talent agency at age 12.

== Acting career ==
=== Television ===
In 1993 at age 13, Danes got her first big job working on the Dudley Moore TV sitcom pilot called &quot;Dudley&quot;, which was shot at Silvercup Studios in Astoria, Queens. Later that same year, Danes played a 15-year-old teenage murderer in a guest starring role on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in the season three episode &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. She appeared in an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;The Coming out of Heidi Leiter&quot;. 

She then starred as the 15-year-old Angela Chase in the television drama series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. In March 1993, a pilot episode was shot; it would be almost another year and a half before broadcast. For her role, she won a Golden Globe Award and received an Emmy nomination. Despite being canceled after only 19 episodes, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; has developed a large cult following. In 1995, she starred in the Soul Asylum music video for &quot;Just Like Anyone&quot;.

In 2010, Danes returned to television starring in the HBO production of &quot;Temple Grandin&quot;, a biopic about the autistic animal scientist. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie. The film was well received and Grandin herself praised Danes&#x27;s performance.

From 2011 to 2020, Danes starred in the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot;, in which she played Carrie Mathison, an agent of the CIA who has bipolar disorder. She won two consecutive Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in &quot;Homeland&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Danes one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

In 2022, Danes replaced Keira Knightley as Cora Seaborn in the Apple TV drama series &quot;The Essex Serpent&quot;, based on the 2016 novel by Sarah Perry.

===Film===
Danes played Beth March in the 1994 film adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot;. Although ABC canceled &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; in 1995, her higher profile led to being cast in several film roles, including 1995&#x27;s &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;I Love You, I Love You Not&quot; and &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot;.

Her first leading role on the big screen came in 1996, when she portrayed Juliet in the film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;, inspiring director Baz Luhrmann to call her, at age 16, &quot;the Meryl Streep of her generation&quot;. Later that year, it was reported that she turned down the female lead role in &quot;Titanic&quot;.

In 1997, Danes played abused wife Kelly Riker in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, as well as Jenny in Oliver Stone&#x27;s noir &quot;U Turn&quot;.

In 1998, she played several very different roles: Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and the pregnant teenage daughter of Polish immigrants in &quot;Polish Wedding&quot;.

In 1999, she made her first appearance in an animated feature with the English version of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. That same year, she played the role of Julie Barnes in the big screen adaptation of the 1970s TV show &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;. She also starred in &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;.

Danes left her career temporarily to attend Yale, having made 13 films in five years. In 2002, she returned to film. She starred in &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot;. Later that year, she co-starred as Clarissa Vaughan&#x27;s (played by Meryl Streep) daughter in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Hours&quot;. The following year, she was cast in &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, followed by &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; in 2004. She earned critical acclaim in 2005 when she starred in &quot;Shopgirl&quot; and &quot;The Family Stone&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in the fantasy &quot;Stardust&quot;, which she described as a &quot;classic model of romantic comedy&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in the drama film, &quot;Evening,&quot; and the thriller film, &quot;The Flock&quot;. She was also featured in the 2008 film, &quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot;.

===Theatre===
Danes got her start in New York City theater appearing in performances of &quot;Happiness&quot;, &quot;Punk Ballet&quot;, and &quot;Kids Onstage&quot;, for which she choreographed her own dance. In April 2000, she appeared off Broadway in Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In November of that same year, she appeared as Emily Webb in a one-night-only staged reading of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; at All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills. The production was staged by Bess Armstrong, who had played the mother of Danes&#x27;s character on &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;.

In September 2005, Danes returned to New York&#x27;s Performance Space 122, where she had performed as a child. She appeared in choreographer Tamar Rogoff&#x27;s solo dance piece &quot;Christina Olson: American Model&quot;, where she portrayed the subject of Andrew Wyeth&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Christina&#x27;s World&quot;. Olson suffered from muscular deterioration that left her weak and partially paralyzed. Danes was praised for her dance skills and acting in the project.

In January 2007, Danes performed in Performance Space 122&#x27;s &quot;Edith and Jenny&quot;. Later in 2007, Danes made her Broadway theatre debut as Eliza Doolittle in the Roundabout Theatre Company revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, directed by David Grindley at the American Airlines Theatre.

In January 2012, Harvard University&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Theatricals named Danes their 2012 Woman of the Year.

In March 2016, Danes performed in &quot;Dry Powder&quot; by Sarah Burgess at The Public Theater, starring alongside John Krasinski, Hank Azaria and Sanjit De Silva. The play was directed by Thomas Kail.

==Other work==

In 1995, Danes was the main character of Soul Asylum&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Just Like Anyone&quot;.

In 1997, Danes wrote an introduction to Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Death: The Time of Your Life&quot;.

In 2012, Danes&#x27;s audiobook recording of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; was released at Audible.com. Her performance won the 2013 Audie Award for fiction.

In 2013, she hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo.

In 2015, Danes was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
Danes has been in therapy since the age of six and considers it &quot;a helpful tool and a luxury to self-reflect and get some insight&quot;.

In 1998, Danes was declared persona non grata by Filipino officials. Restrictions imposed on Danes involved a ban from entering Manila or the Philippines and prohibition on distribution of her films in the region. The ban came after Danes said Manila, the capital of the Philippines, &quot;smelled of cockroaches, with rats all over, and that there is no sewage system, and the people do not have anything – no arms, no legs, no eyes&quot;. Danes later apologized for those remarks, but they refused to lift the ban.

Danes and her mother are supporters of the charity Afghan Hands, which helps women in Afghanistan gain independence, education, and livable wages. Danes is also a long time supporter of DonorsChoose, a website that allows public school teachers to create project requests.

Danes is a feminist and has been critical of female underrepresentation within Hollywood.

=== Relationships and family ===
Danes met singer Ben Lee at her eighteenth birthday party in 1997. They dated for six years before separating in 2003.

In 2003, Danes began dating actor Billy Crudup, with whom she starred in &quot;Stage Beauty&quot;. Their relationship attracted significant media attention, as it led to Crudup&#x27;s break-up with actress Mary-Louise Parker, who was seven months pregnant with their child at the time. Danes and Crudup&#x27;s relationship lasted until 2006. Reflecting on their relationship, Danes had commented in 2015, &quot;That was a scary thing. It was really hard. I didn&#x27;t know how to not do that. I was just in love with him, and needed to explore that, and I was 24 ... I didn&#x27;t quite know what those consequences would be. But it&#x27;s OK. I went through it.&quot;

Danes met actor Hugh Dancy on the set of the film &quot;Evening&quot; in 2006. They announced their engagement in February 2009 and married in France later that year. They have three children: two sons born in 2012 and 2018, and a daughter born in 2023.

<doc id="224487" wikidata="Q1758119" url="?curid=224487" title="Ali G Indahouse">
<text>Ali G Indahouse is a 2002 British comedy film written by Sacha Baron Cohen and Dan Mazer, directed by Mark Mylod, and starring Baron Cohen as Ali G, the character he originally played on the Channel 4 comedy series &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; and &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. It is the first of four films based on Baron Cohen&#x27;s characters from &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, followed by &quot;Borat&quot; (2006), &quot;Brüno&quot; (2009), and &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot; (2020). It is the only one of these films to consist solely of a fictional narrative with no mockumentary element.

==Plot==
Ali G is the leader of Da West Staines Massiv, a fictional gang composed of wannabe gangsters from Staines. Their chief rivals are Da East Staines Massiv. Da West Staines Massiv decide to protest when they learn that their cherished hangout, the John Nike Leisure Centre, where Ali also teaches an after-school club, will be demolished by the local council. After he goes on a hunger strike and is spotted locked to some railings by the Deputy Prime Minister David Carlton, Ali is thrown into a world of political corruption as the Deputy Prime Minister tries to use him as a catalyst to ruin the Prime Minister&#x27;s reputation. Ali is put forward as a candidate to be the next MP for Staines and manages to alienate most of the electorate. During a debate, he tries to insult his rival candidate by claiming that the candidate &quot;sucked off a horse&quot;. Unbeknownst to Ali, the candidate actually did so and subsequently resigns, leaving Ali the winner.

Though he is inexperienced as an MP, Ali&#x27;s outlandish behaviour and ideas seem to work. He visits a customs checkpoint in Dover as a delegate compiling a report, where he invites the West Staines Massiv under the guise of experts to consume the confiscated drugs and pornography in the evidence room, and through strategies such as making education more relatable and ensuring the immigration of attractive women into the country, Ali becomes popular; he meets the Prime Minister&#x27;s goals and brings the PM&#x27;s percentage lead in the polls up by 22%. With this, the Prime Minister offers to save the John Nike Leisure Centre.

Ali accompanies the Prime Minister to a United Nations peace conference to avert war between Chad and Burkina Faso. The United States and Russia back opposing countries, and both threaten nuclear attacks. Ali sneaks into the catering area and drugs everyone&#x27;s tea with cannabis acquired during the customs visit, which has the side effect of making the leaders of Chad and Burkina Faso allies and even lovers. The Prime Minister says that Ali has saved the world, but Carlton&#x27;s secretary Kate Hedges figures out what Ali has done and sends the empty cannabis bag to the press. Ali is forced to leave Parliament.

Before the John Nike Leisure Centre can be saved from imminent demolition, a video emerges of Ali and his girlfriend having sex in the Prime Minister&#x27;s bedroom at Chequers. As Ali was wearing items of the Prime Minister&#x27;s clothing at the time, the press misconstrues the video as the Prime Minister&#x27;s sex tape with a prostitute, forcing the Prime Minister&#x27;s resignation. This results in Carlton being made acting Prime Minister, and he orders the destruction of the leisure centre. He reveals that he purchased all available real estate in Staines, knowing that the town will be destroyed to make way for the construction of a new terminal for Heathrow Airport which will make him wealthy.

The West Staines Massiv race to find the master copy of the tape proving the Prime Minister&#x27;s innocence, offering a truce to the gangs in and around Staines to help them break into the vaults and retrieve the tape. They succeed and reinstate the original Prime Minister. Staines is saved from destruction, with the Prime Minister declaring that Slough will be destroyed instead. The film ends with Ali as the British ambassador to Jamaica, where Carlton is forced to dance for Ali&#x27;s amusement.

==Production==
The opening &quot;gangland&quot; dream sequence was filmed in Los Angeles, with all other scenes filmed in Manchester, London, and Staines. Filming also took place at Manchester Town Hall between 31 May and 2 June 2001. When Ali references the Berkshire Massiv of Englefield Green in the film, this is actually in Surrey; the John Nike Leisure Centre is a real facility, called Willesden Sports centre which was later knocked down in real life with them building a new leisure centre in its place.

==Release==
The film premiered in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2002, and was released in various other countries throughout the rest of 2002 and midway through 2003. It was given a limited theatrical release in the United States; the film was released on a few screens in Austin, Texas On September 5, 2003, but Universal had not reported the US box office result.

The film was released via DVD in the UK on 11 November 2002, and in the US and Canada on 2 November 2004. The DVD version has been modified from the original UK cinema version. In the original cut, the film opens with Ali appearing over the BBFC Certificate and changes the categorisation from 15 to 18. He goes on to warn about the dangers of having sex in the back row of the cinema (coming into contact with other people&#x27;s semen on the seats) and to suggest that the audience&#x27;s enjoyment will be enhanced by smoking cannabis. This 30-second introduction is missing from all international cinema releases and all current home video releases.

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
The film grossed a total of £17.2 million on a budget of £5 million.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 53% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 5.16/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on 9 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. It opened to some notably negative reviews from critics; however, over the years, the film began to receive some positive mentions following the successes of Baron Cohen&#x27;s subsequent films &quot;Borat&quot; and &quot;Brüno&quot;. While some hailed it as a successful low culture comedy, it inspired little of the strong fan enthusiasm associated with &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; and &quot;Borat&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

On 18 March 2002, a soundtrack album for the film was released. Featuring music used in the film, it also featured linking material by Ali G as if the album were a pirate radio broadcast on Ali&#x27;s &quot;Drive By FM&quot;. It was an enhanced CD, featuring the music video for &quot;Me Julie&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
In 2012, Staines was officially renamed by the local council to Staines-upon-Thames partly to avoid the fictional gang associations implied by the film.

<doc id="224488" wikidata="Q941264" url="?curid=224488" title="Leningrad Cowboys">
<text>The Leningrad Cowboys are a Finnish rock band who perform rock and roll covers of other songs. They have exaggerated pompadour hairstyles and wear long, pointy shoes. They often work with the Russian military band the Alexandrov Ensemble.

==Beginnings==
The band was an invention of the Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki together with Sakke Järvenpää and Mato Valtonen, members of the Finnish comedy rock band Sleepy Sleepers. The three of them conceived the band in a bar in 1986 as a joke on the waning power of the Soviet Union. The two musicians expressed their wishes that Kaurismäki would direct their first music video, which resulted in the short film &quot;Rocky VI&quot; (1986). After two further short films, &quot;Thru the Wire&quot; (1987) and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; (1988), Kaurismäki decided to direct a feature film about them, &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot; (1989).

==After &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot;==
The band appeared in two subsequent music videos: &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; (1992) and &quot;These Boots&quot; (1993), as well as a concert film &quot;The Total Balalaika Show&quot; (1994) all directed by Kaurismäki.

In 1994, Kaurismäki directed a sequel to &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot; entitled &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses&quot;.

December 2012 saw the release of an animated Christmas video featuring Dog&#x27;Y&#x27;Dog, a dog resembling the dog from the &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot; video. The video also featured a cover of &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot; from an upcoming Leningrad Cowboys album for Christmas 2013.

&quot;Red X-Mas&quot; was a tour of Finland by the Leningrad Cowboys and the Russian Air Force Choir from 27 November to 7 December 2013, featuring over 60 performers.

In co-production with Anima Vitae, Leningrad cowboys is producing an animated feature &quot;Dog&#x27;y&#x27;dog&quot; featuring the half-Siberian/half-Mexican dog (from their &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot; music video) traveling from Siberia to Mexico via the US.

Dog&#x27;y&#x27;Dog also appeared in the &quot;Bonehead&quot; game for Android developed by Leningrad Cowboys Studios and Fingersoft and released 13 May 2014.

<text>The Birla family is an Indian business family connected with the industrial and social history of India.

==Foundations==
The Birla family belongs to the Maheshwari community of Bania Vaishya traders. They are Marwari since by convention, merchants from Rajasthan are termed Marwari. The family originates from the town of Pilani in the Shekhawati region of North-east Rajasthan. They still maintain their ancestral residence termed Birla Haweli in Pilani and run several educational institutions there, including the BITS, Pilani.

===Shiv Narayan Birla===
In Pilani, during the early 19th century lived Seth Shobharam, grandson of Seth Bhudharmal, a local tradesman of modest means. It was his son, Seth Shiv Narayana (1840–1909), who first ventured outside Pilani. At this time, Ahmedabad was the railhead that served trade from a large region of northwest India. Goods (mainly cotton) would be brought from the hinterland to the city and sent from there by train to Bombay for export to England and other countries. Several cotton -inning units were also set up in Ahmedabad, to clean the cotton before shipment to England. Shiv Narayana Birla was one of the early Indian traders to participate in this cotton trade. Later, Britain vigorously fostered the trade of opium with China and developed the cultivation of poppy in India. The Ratlam-Mandsaur region (not far from Ahmedabad) became prime poppy cropland due to the suitable soil and climate. Shiv Narayan Birla and his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, made an enormous fortune by trading opium with China, and this formed the basis of the family&#x27;s fortune. With growing wealth and increasing confidence, Shiv Narayana Birla moved up the value chain and began chartering cargo ships in partnership with other Marwadi tradesmen to trade opium with China, thus by-passing British middlemen. To facilitate this, he moved to Bombay in 1863.

===Baldeo Das Birla===
Shiv Narayan Birla had one overwhelming sorrow in his life: he had no children. By the early 1880s, Shiv Narayan (Narain) had passed on the baton of his business interests to his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, established Shivnarayan Baldeodas, a trading house based in Bombay. His son, Baldeo Das Birla moved to Calcutta set up Baldeodas Jugalkishor in 1887.
Baldeo Das was succeeded by four sons – Jugal Kishore, Rameshwar Das, Ghanshyam Das and Braj Mohan.

Baldeo Das was awarded the Raibahadur title in 1917. In 1920 he retired from business and started living in Banaras pursuing religious studies. In 1925 he was awarded the title of &quot;Raja&quot; by the government of Bihar and Orissa. He was awarded D.Litt. by Banaras Hindu University.

===Ghanshyamdas Birla===
Ghanshyamdas Birla laid the foundation of his industrial empire by establishing GM Birla Company, trading in jute, in 1911. The First World War began in 1914 greatly increasing the demand for gunny bags. During the war, the Birla&#x27;s worth is estimated to have risen from to . In 1919, he became among the first group of Indian entrepreneurs to become owner of a jute mill named Birla Jute. In the next few years he acquired several cotton mills. He later started several sugar mills. The publication Hindustan Times was co-founded by GD Birla in 1924 and fully acquired by him in 1933. Hindustan Motors was started in 1942. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947 he started Grasim (Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing, 1948) and Hindalco (Hindustan Alum Company 1958) among others. He also generously led the grant on the request of Vallabhbhai Patel to lay the foundation of Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya in Anand, Gujarat.

Baldeo Das, as well as his sons, were among the key supporters of the Swaraj movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, in addition to being dedicated Hindu activists. They were active supporters of the Banaras Hindu University founded by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya and were also financial supporters of activities initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. The landmark Laxminarayan Temple in Delhi was built by Jugal Kishore Birla and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi and as asked by Mahatma, all Hindus, including Harijans were welcomed in this temple.

In the few decades before India&#x27;s independence, Indian merchants, including the Birlas, made successful attempts to enter and acquire industries in India which were once dominated by Scots from Britain. This became a part of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s Swadeshi movement.

The Birlas remained close to some of the leaders of India, like Sardar Patel after India&#x27;s independence. When E. M. S. Namboodiripad became the chief minister of Kerala (1957–59), as a result of the first elected Marxist government anywhere, the Birlas were invited to establish a pulp factory there.

In the recent past, the Birlas, as well as several other Indian industrialists, have expanded overseas.
==Family Tree==
A simplified family tree is given below. It does not include daughters or children who are young (or who died young). Lakshmi Nivas Birla was technically adopted by his uncle Jugal Kishor Birla. As has been noted in the press, some of the branches have been more successful than others. The GD-Basant Kumar-Aditya Vikarm-Kumar Mangalam Birla branch has performed the best, with a group turnover of ₹29,000 Crore in 2004. At the other end is Yashovardhan Birla, who has struggled.






==Philanthropy==


Birla philanthropy began in the 1880s, when the Birla family donated over 100,000 rupees for setting up goshalas (shelters for the protection of cows) in Kolkata. By early 1900, the Birla family began to support education, influenced by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. They supported educational charities in Kolkata and in Mumbai teaming up with Jamnalal Bajaj. In 1918, the family established the first high school in Pilani now name as Birla School, Pilani it is one of the oldest school in India. Currently they have 6 schools run by Birla Education Trust (BET), which evolved into BITS Pilani, which has branches in Hyderabad, Goa and Dubai. They also opened a Sanskrit library in Benares and a library in Kolkata. It is well known for the financial support of Indian&#x27;s freedom struggle and for building temples (see Birla Temple) in several major Indian cities.

==Traditions==

In a letter, Ghanshaym Das offered this advice to Aditya (his grandson) when he was studying at MIT: 
:“eat only vegetarian food, never drink alcohol or smoke, keep early hours, marry young, switch-off lights when leaving the room, cultivate regular habits, go for a walk everyday, keep in touch with the family, and above all, don’t be extravagant.”

GD Birla instructed his son Basant Kumar to &#x27;never utilize wealth only for fun and frolic,&#x27; to &#x27;spend the bare minimum on yourself,&#x27; and to deride &#x27;worldly pleasures.&#x27;

This advice symbolized the ethic of the rising Marwari community, with restraint and austerity its defining attributes.

==Family ties==

Although the Birlas are perceived as a single entity, the different branches of the family are now financially independent. However they have continued to maintain family relationships that go back to the times when &quot;Birla Brothers&quot; were an actual entity and Raja Baldeo Das was still alive.

GD Birla&#x27;s both wives died early because of tuberculosis (He remarried after the death of his first wife), a common affliction at that time. The families of his brothers Brij Mohan and Rameshwar Das Birla helped in raising his children. When Yash Birla&#x27;s parents died in a plane crash, Priyamvada Birla, (&quot;Badi Ma&quot;) helped take care of him.

It is reported that Kumar Mangalam Birla had dipped into his own resources to help his beleaguered relative Yash with his financial issues with creditors in order to preserve the family name.

===&quot;Tata-Birla&quot; word pair===
For many decades the extreme wealth in India was associated with the Tatas and Birlas. The words Tata-Birla were often used together. They were distantly followed by Dalmias (Dalmia-Sahu Jain group) for some time, however Tatas and Birlas have been able to sustain themselves as among the most prominent industrialists in India (for 1939-1997 data see) while others have declined.

A plan for development of India was developed by a group of industrialists in 1944, which was termed the Tata-Birla plan or the Bombay Plan, which is said to have served as a blueprint for India&#x27;s first five-year plan.

<doc id="224495" wikidata="Q1190058" url="?curid=224495" title="Physical intimacy">
<text>Physical intimacy is sensuous proximity or touching. It is an act or reaction, such as an expression of feelings (including close friendship, platonic love, romantic love, or sexual attraction), between people. Examples of physical intimacy include being inside someone&#x27;s personal space, holding hands, hugging, kissing, caressing and sexual activity. Physical intimacy can often convey the real meaning or intention of an interaction in a way that accompanying speech cannot do. Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting relationship, whether familial, platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, as well as caressing and massaging. Physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.

It is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain proximity is necessary. For instance, a sustained eye contact is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else&#x27;s personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.

Most people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and human sexuality, and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of the hormone oxytocin and in a reduction in stress hormones. Massages, stroking and cuddling have furthermore shown that they have widespread beneficial effects on well-being. The most pronounced effects can be found for a reduction of pain as well as feelings of depression and anxiety. However, also blood pressure and momentary mood can be improved through physical touch.

Due to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed; however, there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, they also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed via language.

Inducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources. During colder seasons, humans as well as other animals seek physical intimacy with one another as a means to apportion thermoregulation. Some forms of physical touch among monkeys and apes serve multiple functions, including cleaning, treatment of a lice influx or infection and social grooming.

Some forms of physical intimacy may be received negatively. This attitude is especially marked amongst those with haphephobia. One study has shown that there is generally a higher level of physical intimacy allowed between immediate family members than between second-degree relatives. Intimacy norms are usually more negative near erogenous zones. Some jurisdictions may specify this as referring to the genitals, buttocks and female breasts.

==Development ==
Physical affection and intimacy appear to have a profoundly important role during infancy and childhood. The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers&#x27; abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed. In addition to necessary functions like breastfeeding, touch is also used to soothe and calm babies or with skin-to-skin contact called &quot;kangaroo care&quot;. Vision and auditory senses are limited in infancy and babies are introduced to their world primarily through touch and are able to distinguish between temperature and texture.

Decreased amounts of affectionate touch from caregivers (i.e. for infants in institutional settings or infants with depressed mothers) is related to cognitive and neurodevelopmental delays. These delays appear to persist for years and sometimes whole lifetimes. Studies suggest that if depressed mothers give their infants massages, it benefits both the baby and themselves, increasing growth and development for the babies and leading to increased sensitivity and responsivity of the mothers. There are also biologically beneficial effects of infant massage, with premature infants displaying lower cortisol levels after being held by their mothers. During the holding period, the mothers&#x27; cortisol levels also decreased.

==Personal space==

Most people value their personal space and feel discomfort, anger or anxiety when somebody encroaches on their personal space without consent. Entering somebody&#x27;s personal space is normally an indication of familiarity and intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable. In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, are unacceptable.

On the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a bar, nightclub, rock concert, street festival, etc.

==Display of affection==
People who are on a familiar basis may enter into each other&#x27;s personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an intimate relationship or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:
* cuddling,
* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),
* tickling (e.g. back and waist),
* massage (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or
* touching heads.

Bonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.

In public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a public display of affection is generally constrained by social norms and can range from a gesture, such as a kiss or hug in greeting, to an embrace or holding hands. Maintaining eye contact can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.

== Culture ==
The role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children. Peoples living nearer to the equator (Mediterranean, central and South America, Islamic countries) tend to have high-contact social norms, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (northern Europe, North America, northeast Asian). The public display of interpersonal touch and intimacy appears to vary across cultures as well.

The term originated as a pseudo-English Japanese word (&quot;wasei-eigo&quot;), which was coined to describe the intimacy, or closeness, between a mother and a child. Today, the word is generally used for bonding through physical contact, such as holding hands, hugging, or parents washing their child at a bath. The term has been promoted by pediatrician and developmental psychologist Nobuyoshi Hirai (平井信義), and he mentioned it was taken from a term coined by an American woman at a WHO seminar held in 1953. The earliest citation of this word appears in &quot;Nihon Kokugo Daijiten&quot; in 1971. According to Scott Clark, author of a study of Japanese bathing culture, the word is a portmanteau combining &quot;skin&quot; with the last syllable of &quot;friendship&quot;. The similarity with the English word &#x27;kinship&#x27; suggests a further explanation. Use of the word &quot;skinship&quot; in English publications seems to focus on the notion of sharing a bath naked, an idea known in Japanese as . It is not clear why the meaning shifted to the parent–child relationship when borrowed back into English. This word is also used in South Korea. The term is now described in Oxford English Dictionary as a part of Korea-related update in 2021.

== Among non-human primates ==
Some animals participate in behaviors similar to physical affection in humans. Called social grooming or allo-grooming, these behaviors are less common outside of primates, while other species do perform these behaviors, primates seem to spend much more time doing this compared to other animals. Some species devote as much as 20% of their day to grooming behaviors, much of which is spent grooming others, rather than themselves. In more social species the amount of time spent in self grooming is much less than the time spent in social grooming. While these behaviors may appear to be for the purpose of hygiene (i.e. removal of parasites, fur cleanliness, etc.), evidence suggests that grooming behaviors perform a unique social function which facilitates bonding. From an evolutionary perspective, the amount of time being devoted to allo-grooming appears to exceed the amount of time in which it would be adaptive, therefore underscoring the idea that grooming must have a purpose beyond hygiene maintenance. Furthermore, there are core grooming partnerships which remain quite stable and do not change frequently, sometimes with the same partners on the timescale of years.

Some argue that grooming is something which is exchanged like a service with the expectation that equal amounts of time will be spent or reciprocated by their grooming partner. Primates tend to groom each other equal amounts of time or with the expectation that they will be reciprocated with defense in a dangerous situation. Primates who spend more time grooming each other are more likely to defend each other when attacked. Although it is not clear how this effect is brought about, in all likelihood it is the protective effect that known relationships have: more dominant animals are less likely to attack or harass an individual who is known to have grooming partners who might come to its aid. However, the likelihood of a female going to the aid of another female when the latter is under attack is significantly correlated with the amount of time the two of them spend grooming with each other. A more plausible interpretation is that grooming provides the psychological underpinning for an individual&#x27;s willingness to offer subsequent support. It does this not by offering a direct exchange of benefits, but rather by creating the psychological environment that allows support to be traded mutually.

<doc id="224500" wikidata="Q223131" url="?curid=224500" title="A Study in Scarlet">
<text>A Study in Scarlet is an 1887 detective novel by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle. The story marks the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become the most famous detective duo in English literature. The book&#x27;s title derives from a speech given by Holmes, a consulting detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story&#x27;s murder investigation as his &quot;study in scarlet&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.&quot;

The story, and its main characters, attracted little public interest when it first appeared. Eleven complete copies of the magazine in which the story first appeared, &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Christmas Annual&quot; for 1887, are known to exist now, which have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories featuring Holmes, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; is one of only four full-length novels in the original canon. The novel was followed by &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, published in 1890. &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was the first work of detective fiction to incorporate the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.

==Plot==

=== Part I: The Reminiscences of Watson ===
In 1881, Doctor John Watson returns to London after serving in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and starts looking for a place to live. An old friend of his named Stamford tells him that Sherlock Holmes is looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at 221B Baker Street but cautions Watson about Holmes&#x27;s eccentricities. Holmes and Watson meet and, after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes is a &quot;consulting detective&quot;, and his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes&#x27;s deductive skills, Watson&#x27;s disbelief turns into astonishment.

A telegram requests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to the crime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade are already on the scene. The victim is Enoch Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is &quot;RACHE&quot; (German for &quot;revenge&quot;), which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber&#x27;s body, they discover a woman&#x27;s gold wedding ring.

Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys a facsimile of it, hoping to draw the murderer – who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring – out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise.

A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He went to Madame Charpentier&#x27;s Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson stayed before the murder. Drebber, a drunk, attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier&#x27;s daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. He, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with a cudgel but claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence.
Stangerson is later murdered. His body is found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written &quot;RACHE&quot;. The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying &quot;J.H. is in Europe&quot;, and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sickly Scottish Terrier in residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier.

A young street urchin named Wiggins then arrives. He is the leader of the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins has summoned a cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. The captive cabby is Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.

===Part II: &quot;The Country of the Saints&quot;===


In Utah&#x27;s Salt Lake Valley in 1847, John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party of pioneers, are rescued from death by a party of Latter-day Saints led by Brigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later in 1860, a now-grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church&#x27;s Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn never to marry his daughter to a Mormon, sends word to Hope.

Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope arrives on the eve of the last day, and they all escape under cover of darkness. The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed by Stangerson while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies less than a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber&#x27;s house the night before Lucy&#x27;s funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson but begins to suffer from an aortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. After returning years later, he learns Drebber and Stangerson have fled Salt Lake City after a schism between the Mormons. Drebber is now wealthy from Lucy&#x27;s estate and Stangerson has become his secretary. For over 20 years Hope pursues them; in Cleveland, Ohio, Hope recognizes Drebber who has Hope imprisoned for a few months as a &quot;rival in love&quot;. After being released, Hope tracks them to Europe through France, Russia, Denmark and to England.

In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier&#x27;s son, Drebber gets into Hope&#x27;s cab and spends hours drinking. Hope then takes him to the house on Brixton Road and forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies Hope shows him Lucy&#x27;s wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write &quot;RACHE&quot; on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber&#x27;s murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills. However, Stangerson attacks him and Hope stabs him in the heart.

Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he deduced the murderer&#x27;s identity. In the newspapers, Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes&#x27;s refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.

== Publication ==
Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks. As a doctor in general practice in Southsea, Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodical &quot;London Society&quot;. The story was originally titled &quot;A Tangled Skein&quot; and was eventually published by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. in the 1887 edition of &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Christmas Annual&quot;, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed for royalty but instead received £25 in return for the full rights (equivalent to £3,371.95 considering inflation). It was illustrated by David Henry Friston.

The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock &amp; Co, and featured drawings by the author&#x27;s father, Charles Doyle. In 1890, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock &amp; Bowden Limited (formerly Ward, Lock &amp; Co.) was illustrated by George Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.

==Depiction of Mormonism==
According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter-day Saints&#x27; organisation as being steeped in kidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: &quot;all I said about the Danite Band and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It&#x27;s best to let the matter rest.&quot; Conan Doyle&#x27;s daughter has stated: &quot;You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.&quot; Historians speculate that &quot;Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books by Fannie Stenhouse, William A. Hickman, William Jarman, John Hyde and Ann Eliza Young, among others&quot;, in explaining the author&#x27;s early perspective on Mormonism.

Years after Conan Doyle&#x27;s death, Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that the author had privately apologised, saying that &quot;He [Conan Doyle] said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church&quot; and had &quot;written a scurrilous book about the Mormons.&quot;

In August 2011, the Albemarle County, Virginia, school board removed &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; from the district&#x27;s sixth-grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons. It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth-graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
As the first Sherlock Holmes story published, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a British silent film be produced by G. B. Samuelson. In the film, titled &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story. As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now a lost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 film &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;.

A two-reel short film, also titled &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starred Francis Ford as Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.

The 1933 film titled &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, starring Reginald Owen as Holmes and Anna May Wong as Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel. Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names (Jabez Wilson, etc.). The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later in Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

===Radio and Audio Dramas===
Edith Meiser adapted &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; into a four-part serial for the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, with Richard Gordon as Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson.

Parts of the story were combined with &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; for the script of &quot;Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes&quot;, one of multiple radio adaptations featuring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode first aired on the BBC Light Programme on 5 October 1954 and also aired on NBC Radio on 2 January 1955.

The story was adapted for the 1952–1969 BBC radio series in 1962 by Michael Hardwick, with Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It aired on the BBC Home Service.

Another British radio version of the story adapted by Hardwick aired on 25 December 1974, with Robert Powell as Holmes and Dinsdale Landen as Watson. The cast also included Frederick Treves as Gregson, John Hollis as Lestrade, and Don Fellows as Jefferson Hope.

A radio dramatisation of the story aired on &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; during its 1977 season, with Kevin McCarthy as Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.

&quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was adapted as the first two episodes of the BBC&#x27;s complete Sherlock Holmes 1989–1998 radio series. The two-part adaptation aired on Radio 4 in 1989, dramatised by Bert Coules and starring Clive Merrison as Holmes, Michael Williams as Watson, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and John Moffatt as Inspector Gregson.

It was adapted as a 2007 episode of the American radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes, Lawrence Albert as Watson, Rick May as Lestrade, and John Murray as Gregson.

In 2023, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the beginning of the story in its first episode, &quot;Mr Sherlock Holmes&quot;, but only alloded to the mystery itself at the very end and in the following episode. It starred Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Television===
The 1954–1955 television series (with Ronald Howard as Holmes and H. Marion Crawford as Watson) used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode &quot;The Case of the Cunningham Heritage&quot;.

The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Peter Cushing in the lead role and Nigel Stock as Dr Watson.

It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979 Soviet television film, &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; (the first episode combines the story of their meeting with &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;; the second episode adapts the actual Jefferson Hope case).

A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, with Peter O&#x27;Toole voicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O&#x27;Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time.

&quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; is one of several stories not adapted for the television series starring Jeremy Brett between 1984 and 1994.

Steven Moffat loosely adapted &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; into &quot;A Study in Pink&quot; as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; featuring Benedict Cumberbatch as a 21st-century Sherlock Holmes, and Martin Freeman as Dr Watson. The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled &quot;RACHE&quot; and the two pills, and the killer&#x27;s potentially fatal aneurysm (although it is located in his brain rather than his aorta). However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also features Moriarty&#x27;s presence. The first meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted again in the Victorian setting in the special &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;.

&quot;The Deductionist&quot;, an episode of &quot;Elementary&quot;, contains many elements of Hope&#x27;s case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, &quot;A Study in Charlotte&quot;.

&quot;The First Adventure&quot;, the first episode of the 2014 NHK puppetry series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, is loosely based on &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;. In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school called Beeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. &quot;Scarlet Story&quot;, the series&#x27; opening theme tune, is named after the novel. The name of &quot;Beeton School&quot; is partially inspired by &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Christmas Annual&quot;.

===Other media===
&quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; comics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form by Innovation Publishing in 1969 by James Stenstrum and illustrated by Noly Panaligan, by Sterling Publishing in 2010 by Ian Edginton and illustrated by I. N. J. Culbard, and by Hakon Holm Publishing in 2013 illustrated
by Nis Jessen.

In 2014, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was adapted for the stage by Greg Freeman, Lila Whelan and Annabelle Brown for Tacit Theatre. The production premiered at Southwark Playhouse in London in March 2014.

In February 2019, a new adaptation of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; was staged at DM Performance Works at the Factory in Nuremberg, PA. It was adapted by Bill Amos under the title &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Avenger&quot;.

In June 2022, Pitlochry Festival Theatre produced a new adaptation by playwright and actor Lesley Hart, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Lipstick, Ketchup and Blood&quot; performed in an outdoor amphitheater by two performers. The production uses &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; as a play within a play set in a post-apocalyptic future.

==Allusions in other works==
In his &quot;Naked Is the Best Disguise&quot; (1974), Samuel Rosenberg notes the similarity between Jefferson Hope&#x27;s tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, though of course Joyce&#x27;s work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg&#x27;s book.

The British fantasy and comic book writer Neil Gaiman adapted this story to the universe of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled &quot;A Study in Emerald&quot; (2004) and is modelled with a parallel structure.

In &quot;Garage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders&quot; (2016), the second murder is an imitation of this murder.

In &quot;The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve&quot;, a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life.

<text>Labrys () is, according to Plutarch (&quot;Quaestiones Graecae&quot; 2.302a), the Lydian word for the double-bitted axe. In Greek it was called (&quot;pélekys&quot;). The plural of &quot;labrys&quot; is labryes ().

==Etymology== 
Plutarch relates that the word was a Lydian word for &#x27;axe&#x27;: . (&quot;For Lydians name the double-edged axe &#x27;Labrys). Many scholars including Arthur Evans assert that the word &quot;labyrinth&quot; is derived from &quot;labrys&quot; and thus implies &#x27;house of the double axe&#x27;. A priestly corporation in Delphi was named &quot;Labyades&quot;; the original name was probably &quot;Labryades&quot;, servants of the double axe. In the Roman era at Patrai and Messene, a goddess Laphria was worshipped, commonly identified with Artemis. Her name was said to be derived from the region around Delphi.

In Crete the &quot;double axe&quot; is not a weapon, and it always accompanies female goddesses, not male gods, referring to the male bull god itself. Robert S. P. Beekes regards the relation of &quot;labyrinth&quot; with &quot;labrys&quot; as speculative, and rather proposes a relation with (), &#x27;narrow street&#x27;, or to the Carian theonym Dabraundos ().

It is also possible that the word &quot;labyrinth&quot; is derived from the Egyptian, meaning: &quot;the temple at the entrance of the lake&quot;. The Egyptian labyrinth near Lake Moeris is described by Herodotus and Strabo. The inscription in on reads   (). The conventional reading is (&quot;labyrinthoio potnia&quot;; &#x27;mistress of the labyrinth&#x27;). According to some modern scholars it could read * (*&quot;daphyrinthoio&quot;), or something similar, and hence be without a certain link with either the or the labyrinth.

A link has also been posited with the double axe symbols at Çatalhöyük, dating to the Neolithic age. In Labraunda in Caria, as well as in the coinage of the Hecatomnid rulers of Caria, the double axe accompanies the storm god Zeus Labraundos. Arthur Evans notes,

and

==Minoan double axe==
In ancient Crete, the double axe was an important sacred symbol of the Minoan religion. In Crete the double axe only accompanies goddesses, never gods. It seems that it was the symbol of the arche of the creation (Mater-arche). Small versions were used as votive offerings and have been found in considerable numbers; the Arkalochori Axe is a famous and rather larger example. Minoan double axes have also recently been found in the prehistoric town of Akrotiri (Santorini Island) along with other objects of apparent religious significance.

== Ancient Thracian Odrysian Kingdom ==
The double axe apparently carried important symbolism the ancient Thracian Odrysian kingdom related to the Thracian religion and to royal power. It is argued that in ancient Thrace the double axe was an attribute of Zalmoxis. The double axe appears on coins from Thrace and is believed to be the symbol of the kings of the Odrysae, who believed they could trace their lineage to Zalmoxis. A fresco from the Thracian tomb near Aleksandrovo in south-east Bulgaria, dated to  BCE, depicts a large-size naked man wielding a double axe.

==Double axes in the Near East==
In the Near East and other parts of the region, eventually, axes of this sort often are wielded by male divinities and appear to become symbols of the thunderbolt, a symbol often found associated with the axe symbol. In Labraunda of Caria the double-axe accompanies the storm-god Zeus Labraundos. Similar symbols have been found on plates of Linear pottery culture in Romania. The double-axe is associated with the Hurrian god of sky and storm Teshub. His Hittite and Luwian name was Tarhun. Both are depicted holding a triple thunderbolt in one hand and a double axe in the other hand. Similarly, Zeus throws his thunderbolt to bring a storm. The &quot;labrys&quot;, or &quot;pelekys&quot;, is the double axe Zeus uses to invoke storm and, the relatively modern Greek word for lightning is &quot;star-axe&quot; ( ) The worship of the double axe was kept up in the Greek island of Tenedos and in several cities in the south-west of Asia Minor, and it appears in later historical times in the cult of the thunder god of Asia Minor (Zeus Labrayndeus).

==Ancient Greece==
In the context of the mythical Attic king Theseus, the labyrinth of Greek mythology is frequently associated with the Minoan palace of Knossos. This is based on the reading of Linear B &quot;da-pu2-ri-to-jo-po-ti-ni-ja&quot; as λαβυρίνθοιο πότνια (&quot;mistress of the labyrinth&quot;). It is uncertain, however, that &quot;labyrinth&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;place of the double axes&quot; and moreover that this should be Knossos; many more have been found, for example, at the Arkalachori Cave, where the famous Arkalochori Axe was found.

On Greek coins of the classical period (e.g. Pixodauros) a type of Zeus venerated at Labraunda in Caria that numismatists call &quot;Zeus Labrandeus&quot; () stands with a sceptre upright in his left hand and the double-headed axe over his shoulder.

==Roman Crete==
In Roman Crete, the labrys was often associated with the mythological Amazons.

==Modern uses==
===Weapon===
While double axes are common in modern high fantasy settings, in reality they were not commonly used in combat.

===Sport===
Double-bit axes were common in North American forestry: One blade would be sharp and used for felling, whilst the other was a little blunter for limbing. As the forest workers (lumberjacks) were often away from civilization for long periods of time they needed a way to amuse themselves. Thus the sport of double-bit axe throwing was born. In recent decades the sport has been formalised with Swedish company Gränsfors Bruk writing the rules most widely accepted. There are now multiple clubs across Europe that throw double-bit. The sport of double-bit was formalised in the 1990s, whereas hatchet throwing was formalised in 2006.

==Symbol==
===Religion and spirituality===
The labrys is sometimes used as a symbol of Hellenic polytheism. As a symbol of the neopagan Goddess movement, the labrys represents the memory of pre-patriarchal matristic societies.
===Political===
In Greece, the labrys was employed as a symbol of Metaxism. During the totalitarian period of the 4th of August Regime (1936–1941), it represented the regime-sponsored National Organization of Youth (EON), as its leader, Ioannis Metaxas, believed it to be the first symbol of all Hellenic civilizations.

The labrys symbol was also used prominently by the Vichy France regime, being featured on the personal flag of Chief of State Philippe Pétain, on coins, and in various propaganda posters.

In the 1960s the labrys was also used by the Italian neo-fascist and far-right movement Ordine Nuovo, most prominently on their flag.

===Social movement===

In feminist interpretations, the labrys is a symbol of matriarchy. 

====Lesbian symbol====

In the 1970s, the labrys was adopted by the lesbian community, as a lesbian feminist symbol, representing strength and self-sufficiency.
The labrys lesbian flag, created in 1999, involves a labrys superimposed on an inverted black triangle and set against a violet background.

In Kyrgyzstan, &quot;Labrys&quot; is an LGBT rights organization. The group&#x27;s goal is to improve the quality of life for all LGBT individuals in their country as well as Central Asia. Similarly, &quot;Labrisz&quot; is an association in Hungary for lesbian and bisexual women.
===Culture===
The double axe is used by Cretan folklore preservation societies and associations both in Greece and abroad, on occasion with the spelling &quot;lavrys&quot; reflecting modern Greek pronunciation.

==== Film ====
In the 2025 film Lesbian Space Princess, the labrys is the &quot;most powerful weapon known to lesbian kind&quot; and the Straight White Maliens demand it as ransom, driving the plot. It serves as both a powerful weapon and a symbol of lesbian power, propelling Princess Saira&#x27;s journey.

<doc id="224508" wikidata="Q1334509" url="?curid=224508" title="Trevor Nunn">
<text>Sir Trevor Robert Nunn (born 14 January 1940) is an English theatre director. He has been the artistic director for the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal National Theatre, and, currently, the Theatre Royal Haymarket. He has directed dramas for the stage, including &quot;Macbeth&quot;, as well as opera and musicals, such as &quot;Cats&quot; (1981) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1985).

Nunn has been nominated for the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical, the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play, the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director, and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Musical, winning Tonys for &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and the Olivier Awards for productions of &quot;Summerfolk&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; named Nunn among the most influential people in British culture. He has also directed works for film and television.

== Early years ==
Trevor Nunn was born on 14 January 1940 in Ipswich, England, to Dorothy May Piper and Robert Alexander Nunn, a cabinetmaker. As a small boy, Trevor loved reading but his parents had little money for books. However, an aunt had more books, including the complete works of Shakespeare which he read whenever the family visited her. In the end, his aunt gave it to him.

He was educated at Northgate Grammar School, Ipswich, and Downing College, Cambridge. At Northgate, he had an inspiring English teacher, Peter Hewett, who also directed the school plays. Hewett encouraged him to sit the scholarship exam in Cambridge in the hope of studying under F. R. Leavis at Downing. Hewett also persuaded the headmaster to help with the cost of Nunn staying in Cambridge to take the exam. Nunn&#x27;s father could not afford it and the headmaster had refused at first so Nunn was close to giving up. At Downing, Nunn began his stage career and first met contemporaries Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi. In 1962, he directed &quot;Macbeth&quot; for The Marlowe Society and he directed that year&#x27;s Footlights. He also won a director&#x27;s scholarship, becoming a trainee director at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.

== Career ==
In 1964, Nunn joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) and in 1968 he was appointed its artistic director, a position he held until 1986 (latterly with Terry Hands from 1978).

Nunn&#x27;s first wife, Janet Suzman, appeared in many of his productions, such as the 1974 televised version of his &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Nunn directed the RSC production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; starring Ian McKellen in the title role and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth in 1976. Nunn staged the action of the drama with not only the paying audience, but also the audience of all of the actors in the production not in the ongoing scene—they sat on wooden crates just beyond the main playing space.

Nunn became a leading figure in theatrical circles, and was responsible for many significant productions, such as the RSC&#x27;s version of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, co-directed with John Caird, and a 1976 musical adaptation of the Shakespeare play &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;.

A director of musicals in the non-subsidised sector, Nunn directed &quot;Cats&quot; (1981), formerly the longest running musical in Broadway&#x27;s history, and the first English production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 1985, also with John Caird, which ran in London until the summer of 2019. Nunn also directed the little-known 1986 Webber–Rice musical &quot;Cricket&quot;, at Windsor Castle. Besides &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Nunn&#x27;s other musical credits include &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. In September 1997, he became the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s artistic director, a position he retained until 2003.

Later London credits include &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot; (at the Royal National Theatre), &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Acorn Antiques: The Musical!&quot; (2005), &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 2006 at the Savoy Theatre (an abridged version with dialogue instead of recitatives, unlike Nunn&#x27;s first production of the opera).

He directed &quot;We Happy Few&quot;, a play by his third wife Imogen Stubbs, in 2004. Stubbs often appears in his productions, including the 1996 &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; film. Nunn directed a modern production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 2004, which starred Ben Whishaw in the title role, and Imogen Stubbs as Gertrude, and was staged at The Old Vic theatre in London.

In 2007, he directed the RSC productions of &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;, which played at Stratford before embarking on a world tour (including the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and then playing at the New London Theatre from November 2007. The two plays both starred Ian McKellen, Romola Garai, Frances Barber, Sylvester McCoy, and William Gaunt. Nunn&#x27;s television production of &quot;King Lear&quot; was screened on Boxing Day, 2008 with McKellen in the title role.

In 2008, he returned to the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry (the theatre where he started his career) to direct Joanna Murray-Smith&#x27;s adaptation of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;, starring Imogen Stubbs and Iain Glen. Nunn&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; opened at the New London Theatre in April 2008 and, after poor reviews, closed on 14 June 2008 after 79 performances. In December 2008, he directed a revival of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the Menier Chocolate Factory, which transferred to the West End at the Garrick Theatre in 2009. The production transferred to Broadway, opening in November 2009, with Catherine Zeta-Jones as Desiree Armfeldt and Angela Lansbury as Madame Armfeldt. Other members of the original London cast also transferred with the production. The production closed in January 2011 after 425 performances.

In 2010, Nunn directed a revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; from July to September 2010 at the Menier Chocolate Factory and the play &quot;Birdsong&quot;, which opened in September 2010 at the Comedy Theatre, based on the Sebastian Faulks novel of the same title.

Nunn marked his debut as artistic director of the Theatre Royal Haymarket with a revival of &quot;Flare Path&quot; (as part of the playwright, Terence Rattigan&#x27;s, centenary year celebrations). The production, starring Sienna Miller, James Purefoy and Sheridan Smith, opened in March 2011 and closed in June 2011, and was followed by productions of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, (June–August 2011) and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, starring Ralph Fiennes (September–October 2011). His final production at the Haymarket, &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (November 2011 – January 2012), starred Joanna Lumley and Robert Lindsay.

Nunn returned to the Haymarket in 2014 to direct the play &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

For Christmas 2018, Nunn directed a revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; at the Menier Chocolate Factory, before transferring to the Playhouse Theatre in London&#x27;s West End for a limited season in spring 2019. The production starred Andy Nyman as Tevye and Judy Kuhn as Golde.

In 2020, he was due to direct a new musical &quot;Identical&quot; based on &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. It was due to have its world premiere at the Nottingham Playhouse before transferring to the Theatre Royal, Bath, over the summer of 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the production was delayed until August 2022.

=== Film and opera ===
Nunn has directed opera at Glyndebourne. He re-staged his Glyndebourne production of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; for television in 1993, and was highly praised.

He has directed for film, including &quot;Lady Jane&quot; (1986), &quot;Hedda&quot;, an adaptation of Hedda Gabler, and a 1996 film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Nunn has been married three times and has five children. He was married to actress Janet Suzman from 17 October 1969 until their divorce in 1986. They have one son. From 1986 until their 1991 divorce, he was married to Sharon Lee-Hill, with whom he has two children, including Laurie.

In 1994, he married actress Imogen Stubbs with whom he has two children, including Ellie. In April 2011 Stubbs announced their separation.

Nunn was in a brief relationship with Nancy Dell&#x27;Olio in 2011.

In 1998, Nunn was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party. In 2002, he was knighted.

In 2014, Nunn told &quot;The Telegraph&quot; that Shakespeare was his religion. &quot;Shakespeare has more wisdom and insight about our lives, about how to live and how not to live, how to forgive and how to understand our fellow creatures, than any religious tract. One hundred times more than the Bible. I&#x27;m sorry to say that. But over and over again in the plays there is an understanding of the human condition that doesn&#x27;t exist in religious books.&quot;

<text>Jamil Al Midfai (Arabic: جميل المدفعي; (1958 – 1890)) was an Iraqi politician. He served as the country&#x27;s prime minister on five separate occasions.

==Biography==
Born in the town of Mosul, Midfai served in the Ottoman army during World War I, but deserted in 1916 to take part in the nationalist Arab Revolt. After the war, he was an aide to the Emir Faisal during his brief reign in Syria. He returned to Iraq in 1920, but was soon forced into exile in Jordan because of his anti-British nationalist activities. Upon his return in 1923, he served in various senior provincial capacities and finally joined the cabinet in 1930.

He was elected as the president of the Chamber of Deputies from December 1930 to November 1931, and from November 1931 to November 1933.

As a seasoned politician and two-time prime minister, he was asked to form a new government in August 1937, following the assassination of General Bakr Sidqi, who had ruled the country as a military dictator for almost a year. A staunch monarchist, Midfai was again forced into exile to Transjordan following the short-lived pro-Axis coup by Rashid Ali al-Kaylani in 1941.

Upon his return to Iraq, he served in various senior capacities including President of the Senate of Iraq in the 1950s, and briefly as prime minister after the suspension of political activities during the Iraqi Intifada. He died on 26 October 1958 suffering from lung cancer.

== Fourth Ministry ==
When the Crown Prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah came back to Baghdad in 1 June 1941, He summoned Midfai to Him and after careful consultations, the opinion settled on Midfai to form a new government, so the Prince sent Him the following letter:
The circumstances in which Al-Madfai was tasked with forming his fifth cabinet were strict and required the appointment of ministers and determining their responsibilities so quickly that he could not think about the extent of the cooperation that would take place between him and his associates in the management of state affairs in these circumstances.
And accordingly, the royal will was issued on the second day of June 1941 to appoint:
#Jamil Al-Midfai: the Prime Minister
#Ali Jawdat al-Aiyubi: Minister of Foreign Affairs
#Mustafa Mahmud al-Umari: Minister of Interior
#Nadhif Al-Shawi: Minister of Defense
#Ibrahim Kemal: Minister of Finance and Minister of Justice
#Jalal Baban: Minister of Works and Communications
#Nasrat al-Farisi: Minister of economy
#Mohammed Ridha Al-Shabibi: Minister of Knowledge.

<text>Cahir (; ) is a town in County Tipperary in Ireland. It is also a civil parish in the barony of Iffa and Offa West.

==Location and access==
For much of the twentieth century, Cahir stood at an intersection of two busy national roadways: the Dublin to Cork N8, and the Limerick to Waterford N24. The N8 was realigned in 1991 to run west of the town, while the old road through it was renumbered the R670. Traffic from the N24 still left the town badly congested, however, until October 2007 when this road was also realigned to bypass Cahir to the north and east. The same road improvement scheme saw major changes to the N8 corridor: a new motorway, the M8, was constructed west of the town between 2006 and 2008. Access to Cahir from this motorway is gained at Junctions 10 and 11.

Cahir is on the Limerick–Waterford railway line. The town&#x27;s railway station opened on 1 May 1852. There are two trains a day to Tipperary and Limerick Junction and two to Clonmel, Carrick on Suir and Waterford. There is no Sunday service.

Bus Éireann runs regular services to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford through the town.

==History==
The name &quot;Cathair&quot; or &quot;an Chathair&quot; translates as &quot;stone ringfort&quot;, while the name &quot;Cathair Dún Iascaigh&quot; means &quot;town of the fort of the fishery&quot;. In older accounts, it was often spelled &quot;Caher&quot;. Cahir Abbey was established in the late 12th century.

For much of its history, the town has been influenced by the Butler family. It was from this family that the first Barons of Cahir were created. It was known for much of its history as being a defence town.

Cahir, together with Clonmel, were the centres in South Tipperary of the Quaker population, who constructed a meeting house in Abbey Street in 1833. The principal Quaker family names, largely engaged in milling, were Grubb, Going and Walpole. It was one of the first towns to be linked by stagecoach in the nineteenth century, when Charles Bianconi commenced services between Clonmel, Cahir and Cashel. The building at The Square, where The Galtee Inn is now sited, was the stopping point in the town for Bianconi&#x27;s coaches.

==Amenities and features==
Cahir Castle, which is situated on a small island in the River Suir, is one of the town&#x27;s main tourist attraction. Cahir has a fine Church of Ireland parish church, still in use, designed by John Nash, one of only three ecclesiastical buildings he designed in Ireland. Another major attraction is the Swiss Cottage; there are also numerous specialty heritage walks. The nearby Galtee Mountains form the largest inland range in Ireland and are home to Glengarra Wood, which is a popular walking area. The Knockmealdown Mountains stand south of the town, while to the southwest lie the Mitchelstown Caves. The salmon weir, on the opposite side of the bridge from the castle, is a popular fishing location.

Cahir is a small heritage town. A shopping precinct is centred on the town square adjacent to Castle Street. The town has a leisure centre (Duneske), an all-weather soccer pitch, all weather tennis courts, a Downhill and Enduro mountain-biking track and a GAA pitch. An 18-hole golf course lies outside the town.

==Education==
Schools in the town include Bunscoil na Cathrach (Primary School) and Coláiste Dún Iascaigh (Secondary School). Our Lady of Mercy Primary School and Cahir Boys National School merged in 2022 to form Bunscoil na Cathrach.

==Sports==
Cahir has a number of teams in various sports. Cahir GAA are the local Gaelic team and play on the GAA pitch located on the Ardfinnan road. They were Tipperary Senior Football Champions in 2003. Cahir Park AFC are the local junior soccer team. Formed in 1910, they are one of the oldest junior soccer teams in the country. Their ground is also located in Cahir Park on the Ardfinnan road.

==International relations==
Cahir has been twinned with the town of Scarborough in England since 2003.

<doc id="224515" wikidata="Q35140" url="?curid=224515" title="Performance">
<text>A performance is an act or process of staging or presenting a play, concert, or other form of entertainment. It is also defined as the action or process of carrying out or accomplishing an action, task, or function. 

Performance has evolved globally, from ancient rituals to modern artistic expressions. Expanding the article with historical and cultural perspectives would improve its scope.

Ancient &amp; Classical Theater: Rooted in rituals (Egyptian passion plays, Indigenous storytelling), early performances led to Greek tragedy, Sanskrit drama, and Chinese opera.
Medieval &amp; Early Modern Performance: Includes mystery plays in Europe, Commedia dell’arte in Italy, and Kabuki &amp; Noh in Japan.
Contemporary &amp; Political Performance: Modern forms include agitprop theater, Forum Theater, and performance art as activism.
By highlighting global traditions, the article would better reflect performance as a universal human expression shaped by history and culture.

== Management science ==
In the work place, job performance is the hypothesized conception or requirements of a role. There are two types of job performances: contextual and task. Task performance is dependent on cognitive ability, while contextual performance is dependent on personality. Task performance relates to behavioral roles that are recognized in job descriptions and remuneration systems. They are directly related to organizational performance, whereas contextual performances are value-based and add additional behavioral roles that are not recognized in job descriptions and covered by compensation; these are extra roles that are indirectly related to organizational performance. Citizenship performance, like contextual performance, relates to a set of individual activity/contribution (prosocial organizational behavior) that supports organizational culture.

== Arts ==

In performing arts, a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer, or group of performers, present one or more works of art to an audience. In instrumental music and drama, a performance is typically described as a &quot;play&quot;. Typically, the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand to practice the work.

An effective performance is determined by the achieved skills and competency of the performer, also known as the level of skill and knowledge. In 1994, Spencer and McClelland defined competency as &quot;a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge) that helps a performer to differentiate themselves as superior from the average performer&quot;. A performance also describes the way in which an actor performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a mime artist, comedian, conjurer, magician, or other entertainer.

== Aspects of performance art ==

Another aspect of performance that grew in popularity in the early 20th century is performance art. The origins of Performance art started with Dada and Russian constructivism groups, focusing on avant-garde poetry readings and live paintings meant to be viewed by an audience. It can be scripted or completely improvised and includes audience participation if desired.

The emergence of abstract expressionism in the 1950s with Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning gave way to action painting, a technique that emphasized the dynamic movements of artists as they splattered paint and other media on canvas or glass. For these artists, the motion of putting paint on canvas was just as valuable as the finished painting, and so it was common for artists to document their work in film; such as the short film Jackson Pollock 51(1951), featuring Pollock dripping paint onto a massive canvas on his studio floor. Situationists in France, led by Guy Debord, married avant-garde art with revolutionary politics to incite everyday acts of anarchy. The &quot;Naked City Map&quot; (1957) fragments the 19 sections of Paris, featuring the technique of détournement and abstraction of the traditional environment, deconstructing the geometry and order of a typical city map.

At the New School for Social Research in New York, John Cage and Allan Kaprow became involved in developing happening performance art. These carefully scripted one-off events incorporated the audience into acts of chaos and spontaneity. These happenings challenged traditional art conventions and encouraged artists to carefully consider the role of an audience. In Japan, the 1954 Gutai group led by Yoshihara Jiro, Kanayma Akira, Murakami Saburo, Kazuo Shiraga, and Shimamoto Shozo made the materials of art-making come to life with body movement and blurring the line between art and theater. Kazuo Shiraga&#x27;s &quot;Challenging Mud (1955)&quot; is a performance of the artist rolling and moving in mud, using their body as the art-making tool, and emphasizing the temporary nature of performance art.

Valie Export, an Austrian artist born Waltraud Lehner, performed &quot;Tap and Touch Cinema&quot; in 1968. She walked around the streets in Vienna during a film festival wearing a styrofoam box with a curtain over her chest. Bystanders were asked to put their hands inside the box and touch her bare chest. This commentary on women sexualization in film focused on the sense of touch rather than sight. Adrian Piper and her performance Catalysis III (1970) featured the artist walking down New York City streets with her outfit painted white and a sign across her chest that said &quot;wet paint.&quot; She was interested in the invisible social and racial dynamics in America and was determined to encourage civic-mindedness and interruption of the system. Carolee Schneemann, American artist, performed Interior Scroll in 1975, where she unrolls Super-8 film &quot;Kitsch&#x27;s Last Meal&quot; from her genitals. This nude performance contributes to a discourse on femininity, sexualization, and film.

== Performance state ==

Williams and Krane define the ideal performance state as a mental state having the following characteristics:

* Absence of fear
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or self-efficacy
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are: motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk, and cognitive regulation to achieve automaticity. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness. Performance is not always a result of practice, but rather about honing in a skill. Over practicing itself can result in failure due to ego depletion.

According to Andranik Tangian, the best results are achieved when spontaneity and even improvisation are backed up by rational elements that arrange means of expression in a certain structure, supporting the communication (not just verbal) with the audience.

=== Stage fright ===

Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer&#x27;s heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject&#x27;s speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject&#x27;s speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject&#x27;s speech). The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher&#x27;s findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.

Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported anxiety of performers. Other physiological responses to public performance include perspiration, secretion of the adrenal glands, and increased blood pressure.

<text>Phineas Finn is a novel by Anthony Trollope and the name of its leading character. The novel was first published as a monthly serial from 1867 to 1868 and issued in book form in 1869. It is the second of the &quot;Palliser&quot; series of novels. Its sequel, &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;, is the fourth novel in the series.

It deals with British politics of the 1860s, including voting reform, secret ballot, rotten boroughs, and Irish tenant-right, as well as Finn&#x27;s romances with women of fortune, which would secure his financial future.

==Synopsis==
Volume I: In Killaloe, County Clare, Phineas Finn is the only son of a successful doctor who can afford to send him to London to study law. His friend Laurence Fitzgibbon stirs Finn&#x27;s appetite for politics. Loughshane, a pocket borough in Ireland, is controlled by Tory Lord Tulla. He declines to oppose Finn&#x27;s attempt to win the borough for the Whigs.

Finn is elected to Parliament without a salary. He decides to make a go of politics on his father&#x27;s small allowance. Within the social circle of his fellow MPs, he falls in love with Lady Laura Standish, the wealthy daughter of a prominent Whig politician. Just before he can propose to her, Lady Laura reveals she has accepted Robert Kennedy. She confides the marriage is necessary to settle the debts of her brother Oswald, Lord Chiltern.

Lady Laura mentors Phineas and helps him advance through the party. He makes a disastrous maiden speech, but he gets on well with his peers, particularly reformer Joshua Monk. Tulla reconciles with the Tories, and Finn cannot retain his seat. He happens to save Mr. Kennedy from a garrotting. Lady Laura convinces her father to let Finn stand for the family borough of Loughton, since her brother is uninterested in representing it.

Chiltern and Finn become close friends. Chiltern&#x27;s family has long intended for him to marry Violet Effingham, a wealthy orphan who lives with her aunt. Violet has refused Chiltern&#x27;s proposals countless times. Finn becomes enraptured by Violet and pursues her. Chiltern is incensed by what he sees as a betrayal and challenges Finn to a duel.

Volume II: Chiltern and Finn duel in Blankenberg. Finn does not aim at Chiltern, but Chiltern wounds him.

A wealthy widow, Madame Max Goesler, begins to socialise in Parliamentary circles. She becomes Finn&#x27;s confidante. He is appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, with a salary of £2,000 a year.

Lady Laura&#x27;s marriage grows more difficult as Kennedy cannot ignore her interest in Finn. Kennedy even suggests their relationship may be improper. Lady Laura refuses to live with a man who suspects her and retreats to her father&#x27;s. Kennedy will not relinquish his rights as a husband. So, Lady Laura flees to Dresden.

Finn follows his party&#x27;s support for a Reform Act, even though it means his own seat will be abolished. He finds Lord Tulla is indifferent to Loughshane again, and wins the seat back. He returns to Ireland with Mr. Monk, who is on a speaking tour in support of Irish tenant farmers. Finn gives a speech at their stop in Dublin where he supports a vote on Monk&#x27;s tenant-right bill. While in Ireland, he proposes to Mary Flood Jones, a friend of his sister who has loved him since she was a teenager.

Because Monk&#x27;s bill is not the official policy of the party, Finn is at odds with the leadership. He is despondent that he must resign. Madame Goesler offers to marry him and support his career with her fortune. Though tempted, Finn returns to Mary in Ireland. His party rewards Finn&#x27;s previous service with a £1,000/year sinecure as a poor-law inspector in Cork.

==Historical background==
In October 1867, the very month that &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; began its serial run, Trollope resigned his position in the General Post Office. His salary was now dwarfed by his royalties. When the 14th instalment of the novel was being published, in November 1868, Trollope ran as a Liberal in the Parliamentary election for Beverley. He finished last, and the seat was held by the Conservative Party although the general election returned the Liberal Party to a parliamentary majority. Ironically, the Beverley election was set aside and the seat voided because of bribery, touching on some of the central issues of Trollope&#x27;s novel.

&quot;Phineas Finn&quot; is the second instalment of Trollope&#x27;s hexalogy known as &quot;The Palliser Novels&quot;, often referred to as his political or Parliamentary novels. The author considered &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; and &quot;Phineas Redux&quot; to be two halves of one novel, despite the fact that the latter instalment was published as the fourth in the series, after &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot;.

===Politics===
Phineas&#x27; saga begins Trollope&#x27;s political project in earnest. In order to enable him to shift the focus of the cycle more towards Parliament, Trollope was given permission by the Speaker of the House of Commons to observe proceedings for several months.

Trollope covers a wide range of current political issues in &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, such as the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the War Office&#x27;s procurement process, disestablishment of the Irish Church, and corrupt electoral practices such as treating. The novel sends up the vacuity of politics by showing Liberals and Conservatives voting against their own stated positions when they see a tactical advantage in doing so. Several policy tensions are structural to the plot of the novel.

Trollope regretted making Ireland Phineas&#x27; home. It created narrative issues he could not tidily resolve, and he felt it made English readers less sympathetic towards his protagonist. Phineas is supposed to be a Liberal, but his opposition to Home Rule is antithetical to the politics of the 1860–70s. Yet his downfall comes when he adopts Mr. Monk&#x27;s Liberal position on tenant rights, during their Irish tour. The closer he is to home, the more Irish he is and the more liberal.

Voting Reform is the chief political tension of the novel, and Trollope largely dramatises the actual events behind the Second Reform Act. The bill was designed by Liberal Prime Minister Earl Russell to increase the voting population by 40% and resolve issues such as rotten boroughs, which had not been fully addressed by the Reform Act 1832. It was defeated in June 1866, just five months before Trollope began writing &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;. That led to the resignation of Russell&#x27;s government and the rise of the Conservative Disraeli, who produced his own version of the bill. Disraeli&#x27;s Act ended up doubling the voting population and led to the Liberal Party returning to power in the election of 1868. Trollope changes very little in this sequence of events, aside from making the Liberals the ultimate reforming party.

===Personalities===
&quot;Phineas Finn&quot; was seen as a &quot;roman à clef&quot;. Initial reviews immediately speculated on the real identities of Trollope&#x27;s characters, and scholars have continued the guessing game. Despite Trollope&#x27;s public insistence that he was not parodying politicians, he admitted cannibalising their affects in his private writings.

Phineas Finn is viewed as a composite of the traits and personalities of various figures, including his author. One common suggestion for the inspiration for the character is John Pope Hennessy, a Roman Catholic from Cork, who was elected as an Irish Nationalist Conservative MP for King&#x27;s County in 1859. Since the publication of the book, conjectures have pointed to a wide range of people including John Sadleir, Chichester Fortescue, William Gregory, Colonel King-Harman, and Isaac Butt.

Mr. Mildmay is commonly identified as John Russell, who was serving as Prime Minister when Trollope was drafting the novel. Mr. Daubeny was supposed to be Disraeli. Mr. Gresham was William Gladstone. Lord Chiltern was assumed to be Spencer Cavendish.

Partially because Madame Max Goesler and Phineas marry in &quot;Redux&quot;, her character is often surmised as a gloss on Frances, Dowager Countess Waldegrave, who made Chichester Fortescue her fourth husband.

==Publication history==
Trollope wrote &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; from 17 November 1866 to 15 May 1867. His 800-page quarto manuscript is owned by Beinecke Library at Yale. The novel was serialized in &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from October 1867 to May 1869. Each of the 20 installments included a captioned illustration by John Everett Millais:
1867
*1. October: Chapters I-IV
*2. November: V–VII
*3. December: VIII–XI

1868
*4. January: XII–XV
*5. February: XVI–XIX
*6. March: XX–XXIII
*7. April: XXIV–XXVI
*8. May: XXVII–XXX
*9. June: XXXI–XXXIII

*10. July: XXXIV–XXXVII
*11. August: XXXVIII–XLI
*12. September: XLII–XLVI
*13. October: XLVII–L
*14. November: LI–LIII
*15. December: LIV–LVII

1869
*16. January: LVIII–LXI
*17. February: LXII–LXIV
*18. March: LXV–LXVIII
*19. April: LXIX–LXXII
*20. May: LXXIII–LXXVI

Virtue &amp; Company published it in two volumes with Millais&#x27; illustrations in March 1869. Harper &amp; Brothers brought out an American edition in July of that same year.

James Virtue paid Trollope £3,200 for the novel&#x27;s copyright. That figure matched what he was paid for his next book, &quot;He Knew He Was Right&quot;. Trollope&#x27;s advances declined steadily afterwards. &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; did not sell enough copies to make a profit.

==Response==
&quot;The Spectator&quot; favorably reviewed the book version of &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; in 1869. It found the title character to be frustratingly drawn by Trollope without enough of an inner life. However, it did praise Lord Chiltern as a near peer of the &quot;indelible&quot; George Vavasor in &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;, and felt that Mr. Kennedy &quot;is as wonderful a picture as Mr. Trollope has yet drawn.&quot;

&quot;The Saturday Review&quot; panned the novel primarily because of its portrayal of Mr. Turnbull, whom it deemed to be a thinly disguised version of John Bright. Dismissing most of the author&#x27;s characters as forgettable, it lamented, &quot;It is only the contemplation of Mr. Bright that acts upon Mr. Trollope as a red rag upon a bull,&quot; and they excoriate the practice of violating the confidence of a politician&#x27;s &quot;after-dinner conversations and habits&quot;. The review concludes that &quot;Phineas Finn&#x27;s&quot; only utility will be so a &quot;future historian may refer to it to discover what was the material of which Mr. Bright’s waistcoats were made.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; attacked Trollope for his unflattering portrayal of politicians, particularly John Bright. Comparing his practice, and that of Benjamin Disraeli, to witches tormenting wax figures, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; said, &quot;The author of &quot;Vivian Grey&quot; did something utterly indefensible when he introduced public men as characters in his tales. That is an entirely unfair use of the story-teller’s art…no novelist, is warranted in using gossip or reports—true tales or lying legends—which he has heard in the confidence of private life&quot;. Trollope wrote a letter the day the &quot;Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; review appeared and insisted that his novel was not drawn from life. He protested that he only meant to depict a &quot;turbulent demagogue&quot; in Mr. Turnbull. &quot;I intended neither portrait or caricature, and most assuredly I have produced neither.&quot;

&quot;The Dublin Review&quot; had high praise for the novel and Trollope&#x27;s writing in general, &quot;He holds a place, not only unrivalled, but undisputed, as the realistic portrayer of the middle classes of English society.&quot; Their review praised his knowledge of &quot;the machinery of Parliament&quot; and the issues of &quot;the land question in Ireland&quot;, which they felt exceeded the familiarity of average Irishmen themselves. They found the novel such a sympathetic portrait of Ireland that they urged, &quot;some Irish constituency should do itself the honour of gratifying Mr. Trollope&#x27;s unaccountable desire to enter Parliament.

==Adaptations==
In 1974 the BBC2 adapted the Palliser novels as a twenty-six part serial &quot;The Pallisers&quot;. Episodes 7–12 dramatize the events of &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, with Donal McCann portraying Phineas. Michael Hardwick abridged the six novels into a 400-page book to capitalise on the series, although &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot; and &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Children&quot; are not fully covered by the abridgement.

BBC Radio 4 commissioned a &quot;Classic Serial&quot; dramatisation of &quot;The Pallisers&quot; in 2004. It was adapted by Martyn Wade and directed by Cherry Cookson. BBC Radio 4 Extra has rebroadcast it a number of times. Conleth Hill voiced Phineas Finn, with Ben Miles and Sophie Thompson as the Pallisers. David Troughton narrated.

A new six-part adaptation by Mike Harris under the title &quot;The Pallisers&quot; began on BBC Radio 4 on 10 November 2019. In this version, Phineas is voiced by Edward MacLiam.

<text>Cranford is an episodic novel by English author Elizabeth Gaskell. It first appeared in instalments in the magazine &quot;Household Words&quot;, then was published with minor revisions as a book with the title &quot;Cranford&quot; in 1853. The work slowly became popular and from the start of the 20th century it saw a number of dramatic treatments for the stage, the radio and TV.

==Background==
The fictional Cranford is based on the small Cheshire town of Knutsford in which Elizabeth Gaskell grew up. She had already drawn on her childhood memories for an article published in America, &quot;The Last Generation in England&quot; (1849), and for the town of Duncombe which featured in her extended story &quot;Mr. Harrison&#x27;s Confessions&quot; (1851). These accounts of life in a country town and the old-fashioned class snobbery prevailing there were carried over into what was originally intended simply as another story, published as &quot;Our Society in Cranford&quot; in the magazine Household Words in December 1851. Seeing the possibilities of a longer work in the piece, which eventually formed the first two chapters of her novel, Charles Dickens, the magazine&#x27;s editor, encouraged the author to write more episodes.

Thereafter Mrs Gaskell added seven more episodes over the next 18 months, with an eight-month gap between the sections ending at what is now chapter 8 (written between December 1851 and April 1852) and the later sections (written between January and May 1853). During this period, she was also engaged in writing the three-volume novel &quot;Ruth&quot;, which was published in January 1853. &quot;Cranford&quot; soon followed its serialisation as a volume published by Chapman &amp; Hall in June 1853, with a second printing in August and a US edition that month. Following a third UK printing in 1855 came a French translation in 1856 and a German translation in 1867. The book was not widely reviewed in Britain and it was not until the 1890s that it became really popular.

One of the routes to the novel&#x27;s growth in popularity was the policy of publishers to increase sales by providing lower-priced illustrated editions. The first of these in Cranford&#x27;s case was issued by Smith, Elder &amp; Co in 1864 with illustrations by George du Maurier, whose approach was to interpret scenes in contemporary terms. There was a change of emphasis in Hugh Thomson&#x27;s 1891 illustrations, where the Cranford interiors and styles of dress are pictured as closer to the pre-industrial Regency period of Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s memories. There was also an emotional shift from Du Maurier&#x27;s psychological but compassionate depiction of people in limited circumstances to a greater emphasis on humour and sentimentality, a change of approach which was to prove influential on other illustrators for decades to come.

==Structure==
The work has no real plot, but is what &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; described as &quot;a collection of sketches&quot; on its appearance, affectionately delineating people and customs that were already becoming anachronisms. There it is the continuity of the characters involved that provides unity, rather than a linear narrative. Indeed, the perspective moves back and forth in time as past memories are introduced to account for the present. Necessary distancing is provided by the narrator, Mary Smith, whose point of view is that of a younger woman from a very different background simply reporting her experiences. As the daughter of a businessman living in Manchester (which she calls Drumble in the novel) she only visits Cranford occasionally, a device which is made to account for the episodic nature of the narration.

Manchester was now Mrs Gaskell&#x27;s place of residence after her marriage. The difference between country town and industrial city is as much a function of time as of distance. Many of the personal details and stories, including that of the cow dressed in flannel, are based on remembered fact that had taken place years before. Acknowledging this in a letter to John Ruskin, Mrs Gaskell commented that she had included less than she knew for fear of being thought to exaggerate. The author&#x27;s preoccupation with class in her fiction is here refracted through the glass of a town out of step with what was developing beyond its parish boundaries. In Cranford &quot;the system that, ushered in by the growing industrial and urban economy, was coming to replace the traditional system of rank&quot;, was slower to arrive than the railway.

In the view of Jenny Uglow, the novel chronicles social change, moving from one where consideration of rank was the foremost regulator of behaviour and social relations to a more humane emphasis on responding to individual need. &quot;The small social group begins to encompass those hitherto banned on grounds of class&quot; as the female arbiters of society grow from their initial illusion that their conservative values are effective guardians of gentility to a realisation that &quot;kindness and concern for each other&quot; are a more effective basis of mutual support.

==Synopsis==
The episodes described as taking place in Cranford were originally published under eight titles. The first, titled &quot;Our Society in Cranford&quot; and comprising the first two chapters of the eventual novel, introduces a female society of &quot;Amazons&quot;, mostly widows or elderly unmarried women, living in genteel poverty and concealing the fact under what they call &quot;elegant economy&quot;. These visit each other&#x27;s houses according to a restrictive code of rules overseen by those among them most highly connected socially by birth or marriage. The arrival of Captain Brown, retired from the military and now a railway employee, disrupts their small world by his unguarded references to taboo subjects. Just as he gains their respect by his kindness and openness, he is killed rescuing a child from being run over by a train. His sickly elder daughter dies soon after and Jesse Brown is then freed to marry an old military admirer.

&quot;A Love Affair at Cranford&quot; (the eventual chapters 3–4) begins after the elder Miss Jenkyns&#x27; death, when her sister Matty is flustered by having to host a visit from her cousin, Major Jenkyns. Martha is hired as a new servant, whom Mary Smith trains and the two later encounter Mr Holbrook in the town. Miss Matty recounts how she was prevented from marrying him when young for reasons of social status but gladly accepts an invitation to dinner in his house. Shortly afterwards he takes a trip to Paris and dies on his return and Matty goes into mourning.

&quot;Memory at Cranford&quot; (chapters 5–6), in which the reading of old family letters tells the story of Matty&#x27;s parents. She then recalls the closeness between herself and her brother Peter and how a piece of mischief so enraged their father that he beat his son in public. Peter then ran away from home and was last heard of leaving as a soldier to fight in India.

&quot;Visiting at Cranford&quot; (chapters 7–8) begins with Betty Barker&#x27;s inviting the Cranford ladies to tea, at which social rules are broken but forgiven after all are persuaded to drink cherry brandy and Mrs Jamieson announces the coming stay of her elder brother&#x27;s widow, Lady Glenmire. Tension follows the snobbery of Mrs Jamieson over this relationship, which is deflated when Lady Glenmire shows herself very approachable at a party given in her honour.

&quot;The Great Cranford Panic&quot; (chapters 9–11). The town is impressed by the arrival of the mysterious Signor Brunoni and attend his conjuring show. Gossip afterwards connects him with a spate of robberies that terrify the ladies. But he is later discovered lying ill in lodgings and turns out to be an ex-soldier named Samuel Brown. His wife then describes their time in India and how her little daughter was nursed to health there by a kind Englishman called Jenkyns. Mary Smith wonders whether this might have been Matty&#x27;s lost brother and decides to make enquiries.

&quot;Stopped payment at Cranford&quot; (chapter 12–13). Mr Hoggins is called in to look after Signor Brunoni, where Lady Glenmire meets and becomes engaged to him. While out shopping, Matty hears the rumour that her bank may stop payment on its notes and, as an investor there, insists on paying in coin for a customer&#x27;s purchase. The bankruptcy is confirmed next day.

&quot;Friends in need&quot; (chapter 14). Though Matty will soon be penniless and can no longer afford a maid, Martha refuses to leave. Instead she proposes marrying Jem Hearn and taking Matty in as her lodger. Miss Pole calls a meeting of the ladies and they agree to sacrifice some of their own income to support Matty, while getting Mary&#x27;s father to pretend that it comes as a return on her investments.

&quot;A happy return to Cranford&quot; (chapters 15–16)
After a successful sale of her belongings, Matty&#x27;s house is taken over by Jem and Martha. There she uses the parlour to trade in tea at Mary&#x27;s suggestion. This arrangement does not last for long since Peter arrives after Mary has contacted him, having made a fortune as a planter in India. Matty is delighted and Peter makes sure she remains in the esteem of the &quot;Amazons&quot; by becoming a favourite among them as a peace-maker and teller of tall stories.

==Sequels and adaptations==

Elizabeth Gaskell had not done entirely with Knutsford with the publication of &quot;Cranford&quot;. Thomas Higgins, an 18th-century highwayman and former inhabitant of the town, was made the subject of &quot;The Squire’s Story&quot;, published in the Christmas 1853 number of &quot;Household Words&quot;, although it was there set in the fictitious Derbyshire town of Barford. Then years later she made the arrival of the hoop skirt the subject of an additional farcical episode in &quot;The Cage at Cranford&quot;, published by Dickens in his new magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot; in November 1863.

Theatrical adaptations of the novel began at the turn of the century, the first few of which were produced in the US. Among these were Alice Byington&#x27;s &quot;Cranford Dames&quot;, a play in five scenes (New York, 1900), and Marguerite Merington&#x27;s &quot;Cranford: A Play&quot;, a three-act comedy set in the time of William IV, (New York 1905). Some of the later British examples were merely dramatic episodes and included &quot;The Bank Breaks&quot; by Arthur Phosphor Mallam (1872–1948), based on chapters 13–15 (1912); Guy Pertwee&#x27;s &quot;A Cranford Card Party&quot; (1913); Harry Brighouse&#x27;s &#x27;Cranford sketch&#x27;, &quot;Followers&quot; (1915); and Amy M. Robertson&#x27;s &quot;The Panic from &quot;Cranford&quot;&quot; (1930), based on chapter 10. 1930 also saw the tangential &#x27;play for boys&#x27;, &quot;Higgins, the Highwayman of Cranford&quot;, by Ronald Gow.

In America the novel was adapted for NBC radio in 1946. Martyn Coleman&#x27;s three-act play for theatre, first produced in 1951, was adapted for British television that year. Subsequently, a four-part television adaptation from the novel was broadcast by BBC in 1972. There was also a British musical based on the novel staged in 1975 and another broadcast by Thames Television in 1976.

In 2007 the five-part television series that appeared under the title &quot;Cranford&quot; was in reality elided with three other works by Gaskell: &quot;My Lady Ludlow&quot;, &quot;Mr. Harrison&#x27;s Confessions&quot; and &quot;The Last Generation in England&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Return to Cranford&quot;, was broadcast in 2009 in the UK and in 2010 in the US.

<text>Wives and Daughters, An Every-Day Story is a novel by English author Elizabeth Gaskell, first published in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. It was partly written whilst Gaskell was staying with the salon hostess Mary Elizabeth Mohl at her home on the Rue de Bac in Paris.
When Mrs Gaskell died suddenly in 1865, it was not quite complete, and the last section was written by Frederick Greenwood.

The story is about Molly Gibson, the only daughter of a widowed doctor living in a provincial English town in the 1830s.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens with Molly Gibson as a young child, being raised by her widowed father, Mr. Gibson, the local doctor. During a visit to the local aristocratic &#x27;great house&#x27; of Lord and Lady Cumnor, Molly loses her way on the grounds of the estate and falls asleep under a tree. Lady Cuxhaven (one of the daughters of the house) and Mrs. Kirkpatrick (a former governess to the Cumnor children) find Molly and put her to bed in Mrs. Kirkpatrick&#x27;s room. The Cumnor family refer to Mrs Kirkpatrick as “Clare”, the name by which she had been known when a governess. Clare appears to be a kind woman and assures Molly that she will wake her up when it is time for the entourage to leave. However, she forgets to do so, and Molly is stranded in the mansion. She is distressed at the thought of having to spend the night there. To her relief, her father soon arrives to collect her.

Seven years later, Molly has grown into an attractive, good-hearted, and straightforward young woman. Mr Gibson discovers that one of his apprentices, Mr. Coxe, has become romantically interested in Molly, unbeknownst to her. To protect Molly, her father sends her to stay with the nearby Hamleys of Hamley Hall, members of the landed gentry whose ancestors’ presence there is said to date back to the Heptarchy, but whose circumstances are now reduced. Molly forms a close attachment with Mrs. Hamley, who embraces her almost as a daughter. Molly is also befriended by the younger of the Hamley sons, Roger. Molly is aware that, as the daughter of a professional man, she would not be considered a suitable match for the sons of Squire Hamley. The elder son, Osborne, has been expected to distinguish himself at Cambridge and make a brilliant marriage: he is handsome, clever and more fashionable than his brother. However, he performs poorly at university, breaking the hearts of his parents.

During Molly&#x27;s absence from the house, Mr. Gibson decides to marry again. He hopes that marriage will improve his domestic comfort and provide Molly with a mother figure to shield her from influences such as that of Mr. Coxe. He finds Mrs. Kirkpatrick ideally suited to his requirements and recalls her apparent kindness to Molly many years ago. Molly remembers her from their previous encounter but has little love for her. For her father&#x27;s sake, she does her best to get on with her socially ambitious and self-absorbed new stepmother. The home is not always happy, but Molly does find an ally in her new stepsister, Cynthia, who is about the same age as she. The two girls are a study in contrasts: Cynthia is far more worldly and rebellious than Molly, who is naive and slightly awkward. Cynthia has been educated in France, and it gradually becomes apparent that she and her mother have secrets about their past involving the Cumnors&#x27; land agent, Mr. Preston, who is rumoured to be a gambler and a scoundrel.

As Molly continues to frequent Hamley Hall, she accidentally discovers a great secret: Osborne Hamley has married for love, to a French, Roman Catholic, ex-nursery maid, Aimée, whom he has established in a secret cottage because he is convinced that his father would never accept Aimée as his daughter-in-law. To compound his problems, Osborne’s failure at Cambridge appears to make his invalid mother&#x27;s illness worse. This widens the divide between him and his father, which is amplified by the considerable debts Osborne has run up in order to maintain his secret wife. Mrs Hamley dies, and the breach between the squire and his eldest son seems irreparable. Despite this, Roger continues to work hard at university and ultimately gains the honours and rewards that his brother had been expected to attain.

Mrs. Gibson tries unsuccessfully to arrange a marriage between Cynthia and Osborne, as her aspirations include having her daughter married to a member of the landed gentry. Molly has always valued Roger&#x27;s good sense and honourable character, and soon falls in love with him. Unfortunately for her, Roger falls in love with Cynthia, and when Mrs. Gibson overhears that Osborne may be fatally ill, improving Roger’s chances of becoming heir to the Hamley estate, she begins promoting the match. Just before Roger leaves on a two-year scientific expedition to Africa, he asks for Cynthia&#x27;s hand and she accepts, although she insists that their engagement should remain secret until Roger returns. Molly is heartbroken, and struggles with her sorrow and her knowledge that Cynthia lacks affection for Roger.

Cynthia reveals to Molly that, several years earlier, when she was just fifteen, she had secretly promised to marry Mr Preston after he had loaned her £20. Although she soon regretted this decision, Mr Preston is still obsessed with her, and threatens to show Roger love letters she had written as evidence of her promise. Molly intervenes on Cynthia&#x27;s behalf and manages to break off the engagement and get back the letters; however, her interactions with him give rise to rumours that she is romantically involved with Preston herself, and she becomes the subject of malicious gossip. This leads to an emotional scene in which both Dr Gibson and Mrs Gibson discover Cynthia&#x27;s involvement with Mr Preston. After this, Cynthia breaks off her engagement to Roger, enduring rebukes and insults for her inconstancy, and quickly accepts and marries Mr Henderson, a professional gentleman she had met in London. Molly&#x27;s reputation is restored only after she goes driving around town with Lady Harriet Cumnor, who is well aware of how fickle public opinion can be and wants to help Molly. Osborne, ill and convinced that he will die soon, begs Molly to remember his wife and child when he is gone. He dies shortly thereafter, and Molly reveals the existence of his wife and child to the grieving Squire Hamley. Osborne&#x27;s widow, Aimée, arrives at Hamley Hall after receiving word that her husband is ill, and brings with her their little son, named for his uncle Roger but called &quot;little Osborne&quot; in honour of his father. This child is now the heir to the Hamley estate. Meanwhile, Roger has rushed home to be with his father, and his affection and good sense help the squire to see the possible joy to be had in this new family, especially the grandson. The squire manages to overcome his prejudice against Aimée&#x27;s Catholicism and station and asks them both to live with him.

As Roger resettles into the local scientific community, he begins to realise that his affection for Molly is more than that of a brother for a sister. Aided by the kind interference of Lady Harriet, who has always recognised Molly&#x27;s worth and charms, he finds himself pained at the thought of Molly with anyone else. Still, he hesitates to express his feelings, thinking himself unworthy of her love after having thrown away his affection on the fickle Cynthia. Before he returns to Africa, he confides his feelings to Mr Gibson, who gives his blessing to the union. But Roger’s intention to speak to Molly before he leaves is thwarted by the need to isolate due to a scarlet fever scare.

At this point, Gaskell&#x27;s narrative breaks off: she has died leaving the novel unfinished. She had related to a friend that she intended Roger to return and present Molly with a dried flower (a gift Molly had given him before his departure), as proof of his enduring love. In the BBC adaptation of the novel, an alternative ending was written in which Roger finds himself unwilling to leave Molly without speaking to her of his love, and they marry and return to Africa together.

==Television and radio adaptations==
In 1971, a six part television series directed by Hugh David was made, with the screenplay adapted from the novel by Michael Voysey. It featured Zhivila Roche as Molly Gibson, Alan MacNaughtan
as Dr. Gibson, and Helen Christie as Clare Kirkpatrick.

A radio adaptation, dramatized in nine hour-long parts by Barry Campbell and directed by Jane Morgan, was produced in 1983 and first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in August that year. It starred Tom Wilkinson and Kathryn Hurlbutt. The music is by Rachel Portman.

In 1999, BBC produced a four-part serial based on the novel with a screenplay written by Andrew Davies; &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; featuring Justine Waddell, Bill Paterson, Francesca Annis, Keeley Hawes, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hollander, Anthony Howell, Michael Gambon, Penelope Wilton, Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Iain Glen, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, and Ian Carmichael.

A second radio adaptation was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 Extra in November 2010. It was a single two-hour fifteen-minute segment and was part of a larger collection of Gaskell&#x27;s works, including &quot;North &amp; South&quot;, &quot;Ruth&quot;, and &quot;Cranford&quot;, in audio drama form. It was produced by Peter Leslie Wild and starred Deborah McAndrew as Mrs Gaskell and Emerald O&#x27;Hanrahan as Molly Gibson.

<text>The National Coalition Party (NCP; , Kok; , Saml) is a liberal-conservative political party in Finland. It is currently the largest and governing political party of Finland.

Founded in 1918, the National Coalition Party is one of the &quot;big three&quot; parties that have dominated Finnish national politics for several decades, along with the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party. The current party chair is Petteri Orpo, elected on 11 June 2016. The party self-statedly bases its politics on &quot;freedom, responsibility and democracy, equal opportunities, education, supportiveness, tolerance and caring&quot; and supports multiculturalism and gay rights. Their foreign stances are pro-NATO and pro-European oriented, the party is also a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). The party is described by literature as a liberal, conservative as well as liberal-conservative party on the centre-right, with catch-all characteristics.

The party&#x27;s vote share has been approximately 20% in parliamentary elections since the 1990s and has only been out of coalition governments for eight years since then. It won 44 out of 200 seats in the parliamentary elections of 2011, becoming the largest party in the Finnish Parliament (; ) for the first time in its history. On the municipal level, it emerged as the most popular party for the first time in 2008. More recently, the NCP became the largest party during the Finnish 2023 general election, with 48 seats, and has been the leading party in the governing Orpo Cabinet since 20 June 2023. Incumbent President of Finland Alexander Stubb is affiliated with the NCP, as was his immediate predecessor, Sauli Niinistö.

==History==

=== 1918–1939 ===

The National Coalition Party was founded on 9 December 1918 after the Finnish Civil War by the majority of the Finnish Party and the minority of the Young Finnish Party, both supporting Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse as the King of Finland in the new monarchy. The previous day, the republicans of both parties had founded the National Progressive Party. With over 600 representatives, the foundational meeting of NCP declared the following:

A national coalition is needed over old party lines that have lost meaning and have too long separated similarly thinking citizens. This coalition&#x27;s grand task must be to work to strengthen in our nation the forces that maintain society. Lawful societal order must be strictly upheld and there must be no compromise with revolutionary aspirations. But simultaneously, determined constructive reform work must be pursued.&quot;

The party sought to accomplish their task by advocating for constitutional monarchy and, failing that, strong governmental powers within a republican framework. On the other hand, their goal was to implement a number of social and economic reforms, such as compulsory education, universal health care, and progressive income and property taxation. The monarchist aims failed and Finland became a parliamentary republic—in which the NCP advocated for strong presidential powers. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the fear of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s communist Soviet Union influenced Finnish politics. The Communists, backed by the Soviet leaders, accelerated their activities while the ideological position of the National Coalition Party shifted over to very conservative. The new ideology was poorly received, particularly by the youth, attracting instead more irredentist and fascist movements, such as the Academic Karelia Society or Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement.

In the 1933 parliamentary election, the party formed an electoral coalition with the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement, founded by former supporters of the radical and nationalist Lapua Movement—even though P.E. Svinhufvud, the party&#x27;s first President of Finland, played a key role in halting the Lapua Movement and vanquishing their Mäntsälä rebellion. The result was a major defeat as the NCP lost 24 of its 42 seats in parliament. The NCP broke ties with the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement in 1934 under their newly elected party chair, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, but were nevertheless shut out from the Finnish Government until the outbreak of the Winter War in 1939, only slowly managing to regain their support.

=== 1939–2000 ===

During the Winter War and the Continuation War in 1939–1944, the party took part in the war-time national unity governments and generally had strong support for its government policies. After the wars, the National Coalition Party sought to portray itself as a defender of democracy against the resurgent Finnish communists. Chair Paasikivi, who had advocated making more concessions to Soviet Union before the Winter War and taken a cautious line regarding cooperation with Germany before the Continuation War, acted first as Prime Minister of Finland (1944–1946) and then as President (1946–1956) of Finland. Paasikivi is remembered as the formulator of Finnish foreign policy after World War II. The conflict between the NCP and the communist Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League culminated when President Paasikivi fired the communist Minister of the Interior Yrjö Leino, who had used the State Police to spy on the party&#x27;s youth wing among other abuses.

In 1951, the party changed its official name from the original &#x27; to the current &#x27;. The 1950s were also a time of ideological shifts, as the emphasis on individual liberty and free market reforms increased at the expense of social conservatism and maintenance of a strong government. A minor division in 1958 led to the formation of the Christian Democrats party. From 1966 to 1987, the party was in the opposition. By criticizing Finnish communists and President Urho Kekkonen of the Centre Party, the party had lost the President&#x27;s trust—and thus governments formed by the Centre Party and left-wing parties followed one another. A new guard emerged within the NCP in the 1970s that sought to improve relations with long-serving President Kekkonen. Their work was partially successful in the late 1970s. However, even though the NCP supported Kekkonen for president in 1978 and became the second largest party in the country in the 1979 parliamentary election, a spot in the government continued to elude the NCP until the end of Kekkonen&#x27;s time in office.

During the long years in opposition, the party&#x27;s support grew steadily and in 1987 it attained the best parliamentary election result in its history so far. Harri Holkeri became the party&#x27;s first prime minister since Paasikivi. During Holkeri&#x27;s time in office, the Finnish economy suffered a downturn, precipitated by a multitude of factors, and the 1991 parliamentary election resulted in a loss. The party continued in government as a minor partner until 2003.

=== 2000–present ===

After losing six seats in the 2003 parliamentary election, the National Coalition Party spent the next electoral period in opposition. Jyrki Katainen was elected party chair in 2004 and in March 2006, vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). Under the leadership of Katainen, chair until 2014, liberalism became the main attribute of the party. In the 2007 parliamentary election, the party increased its share to 50 seats in the largest gain of the election. The party held a close second place in Parliament, shy of the Centre Party and its 51 seats. After the election, the party entered into a coalition government together with the Centre Party, the Green League, and the Swedish People&#x27;s Party. The NCP secured important ministerial portfolios, including finance and foreign affairs. In the 2011 parliamentary election, the party finished first place for the first time in its history with 44 seats, despite losing six seats, and party chair Jyrki Katainen formed his cabinet as a six-party coalition government from parties on the left and on the right after lengthy negotiations.


The National Coalition Party&#x27;s candidate in the 2006 Finnish presidential election was former minister of finance and former party chair Sauli Niinistö. He qualified for the second round runoff as one of the top two candidates in the first round but was defeated by the incumbent Tarja Halonen with 51.8% of the vote against his 48.2%. The party nominated Sauli Niinistö again for the presidential election of 2012. Niinistö won the election, beating his Green League opponent Pekka Haavisto decisively on the second round with a 62.6% portion of the votes, and thus becoming the third president elected from the party and the first one since 1956. Niinistö&#x27;s margin of victory was larger than that of any previous directly elected president in Finland. He won a majority in 14 of the country&#x27;s 15 electoral districts. Niinistö is described as a pragmatical fiscal conservative and a pro-European who supports the restraint of bailouts to partner countries. Upon taking office, Niinistö intended to strengthen interaction with the United States and China and maintain good relations with Russia as well as address the European debt crisis. Niinistö was re-elected in 2018 for a second six-year term. He ran as an independent but had the support of the National Coalition Party.

In 2014, Katainen stepped down as party chair and Prime Minister of Finland for a vice-presidential position in the European Commission. Katainen was replaced by Alexander Stubb as chair of the National Coalition Party in the June 2014 leadership election and thus became the prime minister. Katainen&#x27;s cabinet was likewise succeeded by the Stubb Cabinet on 23 June 2014. Stubb went on to lead the party into the 2015 parliamentary election, in which the National Coalition Party placed second in votes and third in parliamentary seats. After the election, National Coalition joined a right-leaning majority coalition consisting of the three largest parties – the Centre Party, the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party. During his term, Stubb faced growing criticism for the NCP&#x27;s poor poll results, the declining economy as well as compromises in the three-party government. After two years as party chair, Stubb was voted by 361 to 441 to be replaced by Petteri Orpo at the leadership election of June 2016.

After the 2019 election, it became the third-largest party in the Finnish Parliament, behind the Social Democrats and the Finns Party, and became the second-largest opposition party after being excluded from the Rinne Cabinet.

Following the 2023 general election, it became the largest party with 48 seats. As a result, its leader Petteri Orpo started forming a coalition government. The Orpo Cabinet was sworn into office on 20 June 2023, a NCP-led coalition with the Finns Party, Christian Democrats and Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland.

In February 2024, National Coalition Party candidate Alexander Stubb was elected as Finland&#x27;s next president. In the second round of the election he beat Pekka Haavisto, a green running as an independent, by 51.6 percent to 48.4 percent.

==Ideology and political position==

Ideologically, the National Coalition Party is positioned from centre-right to right on the political spectrum, and it has been described as liberal, conservative, liberal-conservative, conservative-liberal, and fiscally conservative.

In 2014, the non-profit The Democratic Society described it as &quot;the heir to both liberal and conservative strains of right-of-centre thought&quot; that is becoming increasingly liberal compared to its official stance of conservatism.

Specifically, it contains elements of cultural and economic liberalism and social reformism. For example, it supports multiculturalism, work-based immigration, queer rights and same-sex marriage.

Despite the fact that it was previously considered to be critical of the Nordic welfare model, campaigning for strict doctrines of economic liberalism, in the 1970s the party shifted to supporting more social liberal policies, such as increased social security, which was justified by the increase of individual liberty, although, in more recent years, some have accused the party of adopting more critical views of the welfare state and of embracing more fiscally conservative positions, in addition to the abandoning of their socially liberal and green values in order to move votes away from the growing Finns Party towards themselves.

In international relations, the party advocates for multilateralism. It is pro-European and supports continued European integration within the European Union (EU). For decades, the party advocated for Finnish membership in NATO, and supported the country&#x27;s accession to the alliance in 2023, despite being in opposition at the time.

== Voter base ==

The magazine &quot;Suomen Kuvalehti&quot; created a profile of a typical National Coalition Party voter from over 18,000 interviews in 2011: a 36-year-old lawyer or management consultant living with a family in the Helsinki metropolitan area who supports economic liberalism, conservative values and enjoys alpine skiing and golf. Unlike other conservative parties in Europe, the party&#x27;s voters come predominantly from urban areas while rural areas tend to favor the Centre Party. In 2005, the NCP had the highest proportion of female members out of the major parties. Membership in the party was momentarily on the rise in 2008, but declined from 41,000 to 34,000 by 2016. In contrast, the party had 81,000 members in 1970. According to 2008 polling data, the National Coalition Party was the most positively viewed party by Finns and was the most favored party among the young generation in polls conducted in 2008 and 2014.

==Organisation==

=== Structure ===
The main structure of the National Coalition Party comprises municipal and local chapters organized into districts and as well as the women&#x27;s, student and youth wings. The party conference (), the main decision-making body convening every two years with representatives from the suborganisations as its members, elects the party chair and three deputy chairs as well as the 61-member party council ().

=== Leadership ===
The party chair and the deputy chairs lead the party board (), which is in charge of the daily management and is composed of a representative from each district and from each of the three wings. The party council also elects the party secretary to head the main office, located in Helsinki, and to coordinate the National Coalition Party&#x27;s activities according to the board&#x27;s decisions. Additionally, the NCP has separate groups for coordinating ministers, members of the Finnish Parliament, and members of the European Parliament.

=== Funding ===
Two foundations, &#x27; and &#x27;, assist the party with a source of funding and as an archive, respectively. Reportedly, donations to &#x27; are kept secret, but according to the treasurer, donations are a limited asset compared to the foundation&#x27;s 5 million euro investment capital. In 2008, the foundation supported NCP with €400,000. The NCP owns two companies, &#x27; and &#x27;, to publish the party newspapers &#x27; and &#x27; as well as to handle media communications. Additionally, some thematic organizations report themselves as close to the party, such as the Swedish-language group &#x27; and the queer network &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Left Alliance ( , Vas; , VF) is a left-wing democratic socialist political party in Finland.

The Left Alliance was founded in 1990 as the chief successor of the left-wing Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (SKDL). Although not as electorally successful as the SKDL, it has achieved some success, typically receiving around eight to ten percent of the vote in parliamentary elections. It has participated in five cabinets, most recently in the Marin Cabinet from 2019 to 2023. It is socialist, specifically democratically socialist, and it supports the principles of eco-socialism.

The Left Alliance is a member of the Nordic Green Left Alliance. The party&#x27;s newspaper is the monthly &quot;Kansan Uutiset&quot;. It had two ministerial positions in the Marin cabinet, Li Andersson as Minister of Education and Hanna Sarkkinen as Minister of Social Affairs and Health. It is also a part of the European Left Alliance for the People and the Planet, a pan-European party that supports an alternative to capitalism.

==History==
The Left Alliance was founded by the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (SKDL), the majority of members of the waning Communist Party of Finland (SKP) and the Finnish Women&#x27;s Democratic League (SNDL). It was later joined by the communist Democratic Alternative. The founding meeting was held in April 1990 in Helsinki, following the publishing of the &quot;April Declaration&quot;, which stated the party&#x27;s ideals.

The party&#x27;s history has been characterised via internal disputes and bickering, as it was formed by people with very different views on society. There have been several defections from the Left Alliance to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Communist Party of Finland. In 2005, the party&#x27;s former secretary and Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions&#x27;s assistant head Matti Viialainen formed a group to promote a merger between the two largest Finnish left-wing political parties, the Left Alliance and the SDP. This caused an outrage within the Left Alliance, and Viialainen was condemned for wanting to break up the party. Viialainen subsequently left the party and ran for parliament on the SDP&#x27;s ticket in 2007.

In 2006, the party&#x27;s leader Suvi-Anne Siimes announced her resignation from the post and the party as a result of long-standing feuds with the leftist section of the party. On 13 May 2006, Martti Korhonen was elected as the new party leader. He was followed by Paavo Arhinmäki in June 2009, following the party&#x27;s bad performance in the 2009 EU parliamentary election, in which the party lost its only seat.

In the 2011 election, the party won 14 seats and became a partner in the six-party &quot;rainbow&quot; cabinet. The decision to join the government created a split in the party, leading to the expulsion of two MPs from the parliamentary group. In 2014, the Left Alliance left the cabinet over a dispute on a package of spending cuts and tax hikes. In 2014 European Parliament election, the party regained their lost seat.

In the 2015 parliamentary election, the party received 211,615 votes, 7.1% of the total, and won 12 seats in the parliament. In April 2016, Arhinmäki announced that he wouldn&#x27;t seek another term as the party leader. On 11 June 2016, Arhinmäki was succeeded by Li Andersson. Under the leadership of Andersson, the party gained support in the 2017 municipal elections and the 2019 parliamentary election, in the latter, the party increased its representation in the parliament for the first time since 1995.

In the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election, the Left Alliance suffered its worst defeat ever, losing five seats, this result reduced the party to 11 MPs only. However, in the next year&#x27;s European Parliament elections, the Left Alliance finished a surprising second, ahead of the Social Democrats, and elected three MEPs, including party leader Li Andersson. Prior to the election, polls had shown the party to be in fourth place. Andersson herself received the most votes of any Finnish politician in European election history.

On 19 October 2024, Andersson was succeeded by Minja Koskela.

== Ideology and policies ==

According to the Left Alliance&#x27;s party programme, adopted by the 5th Party Congress on 16 June 2007, the fundamental values of the Left Alliance are equality, freedom, sustainable development, and democracy. The party believes that globally, democracy must be strengthened, and that democracy should be stronger than the power of capital, challenging global capitalism. Important values also include global solidarity, stopping political polarisation in Finland, freedom and the right to work, and environmentalism. The party is for equality in all its forms and identifies strongly as feminist, anti-racist and is in support of economic democracy. The party has been defined from the outside as social democratic. The party supports introducing a universal basic income and prioritizes supporting the weakest members of society.

The Left Alliance wants the European Union to be more socially just. The party endorses the European Green Deal via changing the European Central Bank&#x27;s financial sector&#x27;s quantitative easing stimulus into a green stimulus to mitigate global warming and create green-collar jobs.

The party has traditionally been one of the staunch opposers of a Finnish NATO membership accession. After Finland considered an accession bid to NATO in May 2022, the party was in doubt whether to officially support an eventual NATO membership but assured that it would stay in the Marin cabinet in the case it made one. During its annual party congress in June 2022, the Left Alliance adapted its party program and now only demands an eventual NATO membership to remain defensive, with no permanent NATO military bases or nuclear weapons within the country. It also demanded the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) to be taken off the European Union&#x27;s list of terrorist organisations. The party wants Finland to recognise Palestine and stop Finland&#x27;s arms trade with Israel.

<text>The Christian Democrats (CD; ; , KD) is a Christian democratic political party in Finland.

It was founded in May 1958, chiefly by the Christian faction of the National Coalition Party. It entered parliament in 1970. The party leader since 28 August 2015 has been Sari Essayah. The Christian Democrats have five seats in the Finnish Parliament. It is positioned on the centre-right on the political spectrum.

The party name was for a long time abbreviated to SKL (standing for , , &quot;Finland&#x27;s Christian League&quot;), until 2001, when the party changed its name to the current &quot;Christian Democrats&quot; and its Finnish and Swedish abbreviations to &quot;KD&quot;. The CD was a minor party in the centre-right coalition government led by Prime Minister Esko Aho between 1991 and 1994 and was later a part of a rainbow coalition led by Jyrki Katainen and Alexander Stubb between 2011–2015. It has been a part of the Orpo Cabinet since its formation on 20 June 2023. &quot;KD-lehti&quot; is the party&#x27;s weekly newspaper. The party is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party and the European People&#x27;s Party Group.

== History ==
When the Christian Democrats was founded in 1958, as the name &quot;Finnish Christian League&quot;, the communist-dominated Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League was polling about 25 per cent and became the largest parliamentary grouping. That, together with lax alcohol laws, salacious publications and assistance from the Norwegian KrF, sparked the Christian initiative.

The 1960s were an &#x27;incubation period&#x27;, but there was a growing conviction of the need for parliamentary seats in the wake of liberal legislation. At the &#x27;earthquake election&#x27; of 1970, after four years of a popular front government, the CD only had Raino Westerholm elected. Westerholm was a party chair between 1973 and 1982. Westerholm polled a creditable 8.8 per cent at the 1978 presidential election. The modest &#x27;Westerholm effect&#x27; was a backlash for long-serving Urho Kekkonen, who was backed by all of the larger parties.

The party was a junior coalition partner in government from 1991 to 1995, when it occupied the development aid portfolio. It was a soft Eurosceptic party and stressed the importance of the principle of subsidiarity in European affairs. After being renamed to &quot;The Christian Democrats&quot; in 2001, it moved to a pro-European stance. Bjarne Kallis, the party chairman between 1995 and 2004, was instrumental in the party&#x27;s change of name and concern to attract a wider electorate, being able to draw votes from the Swedish People&#x27;s Party and Finnish-speaking conservative and centrist voters.

At the 2003 general election, the Christian Democrats polled its highest vote of 5.3%.

English-speaking members of the party founded their own chapter in Helsinki in 2004. Its monthly meetings attract immigrants to participate in societal matters and the issues that are particularly important to them. In 2005, a Russian-speaking chapter was also founded in Helsinki, Finland.

== Ideology ==
The party describes itself as following the tenets of Christian democracy. It emphasizes &quot;respect of human dignity, the importance of family and close communities, defending the weak, encouraging resourcefulness and individual and collective responsibility, not just for themselves but also for their neighbours and the rest of God&#x27;s creations&quot;. Membership is open to everyone who agrees with their values and aims. The party also claims to be committed to protecting the environment. It is also orientated towards more socially conservative policies.

<text>Project-X is a horizontally scrolling shooter for the Amiga released in 1992. It was developed and published by Team17. The game resembles Konami&#x27;s side-scrolling shooter games such as &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Salamander&quot; and &quot;Parodius&quot;. It was ported to MS-DOS.

==Plot==
Taking place many years in the future in colonized space, military scientists have disposed of countless, defective military droids on an un-colonized terrestrial planet called Ryxx. The droids eventually become sentient and, by way of revenge, start an attack against mankind, using a station to continually create more war machines. It is the player&#x27;s mission to undergo Project X and eliminate the droid forces.

==Gameplay==
Players control a spacecraft of their choice, battling hundreds of alien ships. Various power-ups, frequent in the first level, but progressively rare afterwards, permit an exponential increase of the spacecraft&#x27;s seven different weapons (Guns, Buildup, Side Shots, Homing Missiles, Plasma, Magma, and Laserbeam).

The game is composed of five levels. Many players never completed the second one (which had a very difficult ending), and most of the rest never went past level three. When Team17 realized this, they released &quot;Project-X SE&quot; on Amiga CD32, a special edition with the difficulty toned down. It was released as a budget game. A hack for the original game to enable the player to skip levels by holding down the fire button and pressing the escape key was also distributed on the coverdisks of several Amiga magazines.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Project-X&quot; was highly successful in Europe, but only sold in moderate numbers in the U.S. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; called it one of the best shooter games for that platform at the time, both for its technical excellence in graphics and sounds, and for its difficult and interesting gameplay.

==Legacy==
The game was followed by a PlayStation-only sequel, titled &quot;X2&quot; in 1996. A second sequel, &quot;Project X: Light Years&quot;, is currently in development.

The game was parodied in one level of Team17&#x27;s own &quot;Superfrog&quot;, as &quot;Project-F&quot; (with the &#x27;F&#x27; presumably standing for &quot;Frog&quot;), even going as far as using a remixed version of the original game&#x27;s theme tune.

<text>Beyond the Limits is a 1992 book continuing the modeling of the consequences of a rapidly growing global population that was started in the 1972 report &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;. Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, and Jørgen Randers are the authors and all were involved in the original Club of Rome study as well. &quot;Beyond the Limits&quot; (Chelsea Green Publishing Company) and Earthscan addressed many of the criticisms of the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; book, but still has caused controversy and mixed reactions.

==Influence==
Billionaire investor Richard Rainwater indicates having been influenced to invest in oil in the 1990s upon reading &quot;Beyond the Limits&quot;&#x27;. His niece Kelley Rainwater reports she gave him this book as a Christmas present. She was introduced to the book through Dr. Jay Earley who is a social transformation theorist and colleague of the Meadows.

<text>The American Institute Fair was held annually from 1829 until at least 1897 in New York City by the American Institute. The American Institute was founded in 1829 &quot;for the encouragement of agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and the arts.&quot; The fair is sometimes considered the first world&#x27;s fair in the United States, though it was fairly small by later standards, drawing about 30,000 attendees per year. It was held at Niblo&#x27;s Garden in New York before being moved to the Crystal Palace in New York.

&quot;At these fairs were displayed the finest products of agriculture and manufacturing, the newest types of machinery, the most recent contributions of inventive genius...[the fairs] served a two-fold purpose: that of playing the part of demonstrator to the public and that of furnishing an incentive to the exhibitors, both through competition and through the desire to win the very liberal awards and premiums.&quot;

<text>is a Latin term for an argument or other discussion that has continued to the figurative point of nausea. For example, &quot;this has been discussed &#x27;&quot; indicates that the topic has been discussed extensively and those involved have grown sick of it. The fallacy of dragging the conversation to an &quot;ad nauseam&quot; state in order to then assert one&#x27;s position as correct due to it not having been contradicted is also called ([[Ad infinitum|to infinity]]) andargument from repetition.

The term is defined by the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; as &quot;to a disgusting or ridiculous degree; to the point of nausea.&quot; Colloquially, it is sometimes used as &quot;until nobody cares to discuss it any more.&quot;

<text>Karakol (; , ), formerly Przhevalsk (), is the fourth-largest city in Kyrgyzstan, near the eastern tip of Lake Issyk-Kul, about from the Kyrgyzstan–China border and from the capital Bishkek. It is the administrative capital of Issyk-Kul Region. Its area is , and its resident population was 84,351 in 2021 (both including Pristan&#x27;-Przheval&#x27;sk). To the north, on highway A363, is Tüp, and to the southwest Jeti-Ögüz resort.

==History==
A Russian military outpost founded on 1 July 1869, Karakol grew in the 19th century after explorers came to map the peaks and valleys separating Kyrgyzstan from China. In the 1880s Karakol&#x27;s population surged with an influx of Dungans, Chinese Muslims fleeing warfare in China.

In 1888, the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky died in Karakol of typhoid, while preparing for an expedition to Tibet; the city was renamed Przhevalsk in his honor. After local protests, the town was given its original name back in 1921 — a decision reversed in 1939 by Stalin to celebrate the centenary of the explorer&#x27;s birth. Karakol then remained Przhevalsk until the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. However the name has been retained by nearby Pristan&#x27;-Przheval&#x27;sk.

Nearby Issyk Kul Lake was used by the Soviet military as a testing site for torpedo propulsion and guidance systems and Karakol was thus home to a sizable population of military personnel and their families. Karakol continues to be a major hub for visitors of Issyk Kul Lake.

==Demographics==
Karakol is the fourth largest city in Kyrgyzstan after Bishkek, Osh and Jalal-Abad. The resident population of Karakol, as of 2021, was 84,351, of which 2,829 in Pristan&#x27;-Przheval&#x27;sk. The largest ethnic minority groups in Karakol are Russians (17.0%, 2009 census) and Uyghurs (3.9%).

==Geography==

===Climate===
Karakol features a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification.

== Symbols of Karakol ==

The coat of arms of the city of Przhevalsk was approved by the highest on March 19, 1908 —
The modern coat of arms and flag of the city of Karakol were approved as a result of the competition for the creation of symbols of the city (coat of arms, flag and anthem), organized in March 2007 by the city council and the mayor&#x27;s office of the city. The main composition of the coat of arms and the flag consists of elements of the sun and the head of a deer with horns (symbols of the Buğu tribe).

==Sights==

Karakol is one of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s major tourist hubs, serving as a starting point for the hiking, trekking, skiing and mountaineering groups of the high central Tian Shan to the south and east. Additionally, the city is quite culturally-rich, with several distinct ethnic groups present, such as Dungans, Kalmyks, Russians, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, and of course the local Kyrgyz.

Przhevalsky’s Grave is a memorial park and small museum dedicated to Przhevalsky and others’ Russian explorations in Central Asia, located about north of Karakol at Pristan&#x27;-Przheval&#x27;sk, overlooking the Mikhailovka Inlet of Issyk Kul lake. This is also where former Soviet torpedo testing facilities are located. Facilities themselves are a closed, government-accessible only area.

Karakol has Central Asia&#x27;s highest ski resort, with 20 km of slopes, situated about 20 minutes from the town. Unlike Shymbulak resort, the riding at Karakol includes forest areas as well as cleared trails.

=== Russian Orthodox cathedral ===

The cathedral was originally built of stone, in 1872, when Karakol was a garrison town established as an outpost on the edges of the Tsarist Russian Empire. It was destroyed in 1890 by earthquake, and the current cathedral was subsequently built of wood on a brick base. It took nearly six years to complete, and was finally done in 1895. During the period of construction, a yurt served the congregation as a church. The building has seen considerable usage, and not only as a church, being used for an anti-Russian uprising in 1916, during which several monks were brutally murdered.

Over the years, particularly following the Revolution in 1917, the church has been used as an educational center, at times housing a school, ladies&#x27; gymnasium, an institution of higher education, a sports venue, a theatre, a dance hall, and even a coal store. Then, in 1991 (following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Kyrgyzstan), the local authorities again gave the building back to the Church, whom assumed responsibility for all future remodeling and structural endeavors.

=== Dungan mosque ===

The Issyk-kul Central Mosque of Karakol was built for the local Dungan community through an initiative of Ibrahim Aji in the early 20th century. Aji commissioned the famed Beijing architect Chou Seu, along with 20 workers (all skilled in traditional Chinese architecture), with building the mosque. The construction of outbuildings, among other projects, involved local craftsmen. Construction of the mosque itself began in 1904, lasting through 1910. Ingenious techniques allowed the builders to construct the mosque without using nails. The building holds 42 based pillars; encircling the building is a multi-tiered wooden cornice, decorated with botanical and natural images such as grapes, pomegranates, pears and peaches. From 1929 to 1947 (during the Soviet era), the mosque was used mainly as a storehouse. In 1947, the building was given to the city’s Muslim community, from whence it has continued to function as a mosque ever since. It is registered as a historical monument and protected by law. Today, the mosque is also open to visitors domestic and foreign.

=== Przhevalsky Museum ===
Nikolay Przhevalsky was one of the first Russian scientists, naturalists and geographers to commence detailed studies of the geography, flora and fauna of the Central Asian countries. Beginning in 1870, he arranged four large expeditions through Mongolia, China and Tibet. During these trips, he revealed the exact coordinates of the mountain ranges and borders of the Tibetan Himalayas and Tian Shan ranges. He described in-detail the weather, relief, ecosystems, flora and fauna in the territories under his study; he described over 200 plant species. Will on these expeditions, Przhevalsky also collected an enormous zoological collection, comprising several thousand species of plants, fungi, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, fishes and invertebrates. In 1888, he died from typhoid fever on the eve of his fifth expedition to Central Asia; he was buried on the Issyk-Kul lakeside, not far from the city of Karakol. The Memorial Museum of N. M. Przhevalsky was opened on 29 April 1957 in Karakol.

=== Karakol Historical Museum ===
This small museum was the pre-revolutionary summer home of the Iliana merchant family. During the turbulent years of 1918–20 the building earned its socialist stripes as headquarters of the Regional Revolutionary Committee, and was subsequently transformed into a museum by order of the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1948. Scythian artifacts include enormous bronze pots retrieved from Lake Issyk-Kul, displayed alongside exhibits on petroglyphs in the area. Besides a comprehensive display of traditional Kyrgyz punched leather work, felt wall hangings and woven yurt decorations, the museum has a colorful collection of national costumes, examples of finely worked silver jewellery and a good exhibition of Kyrgyz applied art. One hall covers the region&#x27;s flora and fauna – much of which is endangered and listed in the &#x27;Red Book&#x27; (a Soviet inventory of protected species). The museum is also worth visiting to gain a Soviet perspective of history in the region. A couple of walls relating to Kyrgyz union with Russia and the subsequent revolution are now historical artifacts in themselves.

=== Bugu-Ene Zoo ===
Karakol Zoological Park was founded in 1987. This is the only zoo in Kyrgyzstan. After the demise of the Soviet Union, the economics of the country collapsed. In 2001, closing the zoo was considered. However, sponsors were found, which allowed the captive animals to be preserved. There are Japanese macaques, bears, wolf, deer, camels, llamas, Przewalski&#x27;s horse, peacock, lions and many others.

=== Animal Market ===

On early Sunday mornings, one of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s biggest farmer’s markets and live animal auctions takes place, around 2 km north of central Karakol, with locals loading livestock in and out of the backs of sedans not being an uncommon sight. The setting, amid semi-derelict flour mills, might seem unprepossessing, but is valued for its space. On clear days, a backdrop of white-topped mountains is visible and is more striking from here than from the town center. A series of earthen unloading platforms lead north. Jostle through the chaos to reach a bigger main compound one block north, where horses and embossed leather saddlery are for sale. On foot, the bazaar is about 25 minutes&#x27; walk from City Center.

=== Hiking and Camping ===
Karakol is popular among fans of hiking and overnight tent camping. The following hiking trails beging here: Karakol Peak, Alakul Lake, Altyn Arashan and Sary Zhaz Valley. These routes have a variety of scenery from green forests to glaciers. The best times for hiking are from June to September.

<text>Mark Akenside (9 November 1721 – 23 June 1770) was an English poet and physician.

==Biography==
Akenside was born at Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the son of a butcher. He was slightly lame all his life from a wound he received as a child from his father&#x27;s cleaver. All his relations were Dissenters, and, after attending the Royal Free Grammar School of Newcastle, and a dissenting academy in the town, he was sent in 1739 to the University of Edinburgh to study theology with a view to becoming a minister, his expenses being paid from a special fund set aside by the dissenting community for the education of their pastors. He had already contributed &quot;The Virtuoso, in imitation of Spenser&#x27;s style and stanza&quot; (1737) to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and in 1738 &quot;A British Philippic, occasioned by the Insults of the Spaniards, and the present Preparations for War&quot; (also published separately).

After one winter as a theology student, Akenside changed to medicine as his field of study. He repaid the money that had been advanced for his theological studies, and became a deist. His politics, said Dr. Samuel Johnson, were characterized by an &quot;impetuous eagerness to subvert and confound, with very little care what shall be established,&quot; and he is caricatured in the republican doctor of Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot;. He was elected a member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh in 1740. His ambitions already lay outside his profession, and his gifts as a speaker made him hope one day to enter Parliament. In 1740, he printed his &quot;Ode on the Winter Solstice&quot; in a small volume of poems. In 1741, he left Edinburgh for Newcastle and began to call himself surgeon, though it is doubtful whether he practised, and from the next year dates his lifelong friendship with Jeremiah Dyson (1722–1776).

During a visit to Morpeth in 1738, Akenside had the idea for his didactic poem, &quot;The Pleasures of the Imagination&quot;, which was well received and later described as &#x27;of great beauty in its richness of description and language&#x27;, and was also subsequently translated into more than one foreign language. He had already acquired a considerable literary reputation when he came to London about the end of 1743 and offered the work to Robert Dodsley for £120. Dodsley thought the price exorbitant, and only accepted the terms after submitting the manuscript to Alexander Pope, who assured him that this was &quot;no everyday writer&quot;. The three books of this poem appeared in January 1744. His aim, Akenside tells us in the preface, was &quot;not so much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as, by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imagination, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to a similar taste and habit of thinking in religion, morals and civil life&quot;. His powers fell short of this ambition; his imagination was not brilliant enough to surmount the difficulties inherent in a poem dealing so largely with abstractions; but the work was well received. Thomas Gray wrote to Thomas Warton that it was &quot;above the middling&quot;, but &quot;often obscure and unintelligible and too much infected with the Hutchinson jargon&quot;.

William Warburton took offence at a note added by Akenside to the passage in the third book dealing with ridicule. Accordingly, he attacked the author of the &quot;Pleasures of the Imagination&quot;—which was published anonymously—in a scathing preface to his &quot;Remarks on Several Occasional Reflections, in answer to Dr Middleton ...&quot; (1744). This was answered, nominally by Dyson, in &quot;An Epistle to the Rev. Mr Warburton&quot;, in which Akenside probably had a hand. It was in the press when he left England in 1744 to secure a medical degree at Leiden. In little more than a month he had completed the necessary dissertation, &quot;De ortu et incremento foetus humani&quot;, and received his diploma.

Returning to England, Akenside unsuccessfully attempted to establish a practice in Northampton. In 1744, he published his &quot;Epistle to Curio&quot;, attacking William Pulteney (afterwards Earl of Bath) for having abandoned his liberal principles to become a supporter of the government, and in the next year he produced a small volume of &quot;Odes on Several Subjects&quot;, in the preface to which he lays claim to correctness and a careful study of the best models. His friend Dyson had meanwhile left the bar, and had become, by purchase, clerk to the House of Commons. Akenside had come to London and was trying to make a practice at Hampstead. Dyson took a house there, and did all he could to further his friend&#x27;s interest in the neighbourhood. But Akenside&#x27;s arrogance and pedantry frustrated these efforts, and Dyson then took a house for him in Bloomsbury Square, making him independent of his profession by an allowance stated to have been £300 a year, but probably greater, for it is asserted that this income enabled him to &quot;keep a chariot&quot;, and to live &quot;incomparably well&quot;. In 1746 he wrote his much-praised &quot;Hymn to the Naiads&quot;, and he also became a contributor to Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Museum, or Literary and Historical Register&quot;. He was now twenty-five years old, and began to devote himself almost exclusively to his profession. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1753.

He was an acute and learned physician. He was admitted M.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1753, fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1754, and fourth censor in 1755. In June 1755 he read the Gulstonian lectures before the College, in September 1756 the Croonian Lectures, and in 1759 the Harveian Oration. In January 1759 he was appointed assistant physician, and two months later principal physician to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, but he was charged with harsh treatment of the poorer patients, and his unsympathetic character prevented the success to which his undeniable learning and ability entitled him. At the accession of George III both Dyson and Akenside changed their political opinions, and Akenside&#x27;s conversion to Tory principles was rewarded by the appointment of physician to the queen. Dyson became secretary to the treasury, lord of the treasury, and in 1774 privy councillor and cofferer to the household.

Akenside died at his house in Burlington Street, where he had lived from 1762. His friendship with Dyson puts his character in the most amiable light. Writing to his friend so early as 1744, Akenside said that the intimacy had &quot;the force of an additional conscience, of a new principle of religion&quot;, and there seems to have been no break in their affection. He left all his effects and his literary remains to Dyson, who issued an edition of his poems in 1772. This included the revised version of the &quot;Pleasures of Imagination&quot;, on which the author was engaged at his death.

Akenside&#x27;s verse was better when it was subjected to more severe metrical rules. His odes are rarely lyrical in the strict sense, but they are dignified and often musical. By 1911 his works were little read. Edmund Gosse described him as &quot;a sort of frozen Keats&quot;.

==Works==

The authoritative edition of Akenside&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot; is that prepared by Robin Dix (1996). An important earlier edition was prepared by Alexander Dyce (1834) for the Aldine Edition of the &quot;British Poets&quot;, and reprinted with small additions in subsequent issues of the series. See Dyce&#x27;s &quot;Life of Akenside&quot; prefixed to his edition, also Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, and the &quot;Life, Writings and Genius of Akenside&quot; (1832) by Charles Bucke.

<doc id="224570" wikidata="Q1414045" url="?curid=224570" title="Malbec">
<text>Malbec () is a purple grape variety used in making red wine. The grapes tend to have an inky dark color and robust tannins, and are known as one of the six grapes allowed in the blend of red Bordeaux wine. In France, plantations of Malbec are now found primarily in Cahors in South West France, though the grape is grown worldwide. It is also available as an Argentine varietal.

The grape became less popular in Bordeaux after 1956 when frost killed off 75% of the crop. Despite Cahors being hit by the same frost, which devastated the vineyards, Malbec was replanted and continued to be popular in that area. Winemakers in the region frequently mixed Malbec with Merlot and Tannat to make dark, full-bodied wines, but have ventured into 100% Malbec varietal wines more recently.

A popular but unconfirmed theory claims that Malbec is named after a Hungarian peasant who first spread the grape variety throughout France. French ampelographer and viticulturalist Pierre Galet notes, however, that most evidence suggests that Côt was the variety&#x27;s original name and that it probably originated in northern Burgundy. Due to similarities in synonyms, Malbec is often confused with other varieties of grape. &quot;Malbec argenté&quot; is not Malbec, but rather a variety of the southwestern French grape Abouriou. In Cahors, the Malbec grape is referred to as Auxerrois or Côt Noir; this is sometimes confused with Auxerrois blanc, which is an entirely different variety.

The Malbec grape is a thin-skinned grape and needs more sun and heat than either Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot to mature. It ripens mid-season and can bring very deep color, ample tannin, and a particular plum-like flavor component which adds complexity to claret blends. Sometimes, especially in its traditional growing regions, it is not trellised but is instead cultivated as bush vines (the goblet system). In such cases, it is sometimes kept to a relatively low yield of about 6 tons per hectare. Wines produced using this growing method are rich, dark, and juicy.

As a varietal, Malbec creates a rather inky red (or violet), intense wine, so it is also commonly used in blends, such as with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create the red French Bordeaux claret blend. The grape is blended with Cabernet Franc and Gamay in some regions such as the Loire Valley. Other wine regions use the grape to produce Bordeaux-style blends. The varietal is sensitive to frost and has a propensity for shattering or coulure.
==Viticulture==
Malbec is very susceptible to various grape diseases and viticultural hazards—most notably frost, coulure, downy mildew, and rot— but the development of new clones and vineyard management techniques have helped control some of these potential problems. When it is not afflicted with these various ailments, particularly coulure, it does have the potential to produce high yields. Malbec seems to be able to produce well in a variety of soil types but in the limestone based soils of Cahors it seems to produce its most dark and tannic manifestation. There are distinct ampelographical differences in the clones of Malbec found in France and in Argentina, with Argentine Malbec tending to have smaller berries.

A comparative research study conducted by the Catena Institute of Wine and University of California, Davis, examined the difference between the phenolic composition of Malbec wines from California and Mendoza, Argentina. Sixteen vineyards in California and twenty-six blocks in Mendoza were selected based on their uniformity and regional representativeness. The study concluded that there are distinct flavor and compositional differences in Malbec wines produced in Mendoza and California.

==Regions==
Malbec is the dominant red variety in Cahors where the Appellation Controlée regulations for Cahors require a minimum content of 70%. Introduced to Argentina by French agricultural engineer Michel Pouget in 1868, Malbec is now widely planted in Argentina. Grapes from this region produce softer, less tannic-driven wines than those from Cahors. There were once 50,000 hectares planted with Malbec in Argentina; now there are 25,000 hectares in Mendoza alone, in addition to production in La Rioja, Salta, San Juan, Catamarca and Buenos Aires.

Chile has 2,361 hectares planted with Malbec, the main places are Colchagua Valley in O&#x27;Higgins Region, Maule Region and Bio-Bio Region. In California the grape is used to make Meritage. Malbec is also grown in Washington State, the Rogue and Umpqua regions of Oregon, the Grand Valley AVA of Colorado, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, British Columbia, the Long Island AVA of New York, southern Bolivia, Peru, northeastern Italy and recently in Texas and southern Ontario, Virginia, and in the Baja California region of Mexico.

===France===

At one point Malbec was grown in 30 different departments of France, a legacy that is still present in the list of local synonyms for the variety, which easily surpasses 1000 names. In recent times, however, the popularity of the variety has been steadily declining with a 2000 census reporting only 15,000 acres (6,100 hectares) of the vine, which are mostly consigned to the southwestern part of the country. Its stronghold remains Cahors where &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) regulations stipulates that Malbec must compose at least 70% of the blend, with Merlot and Tannat rounding out the remaining percentage. Outside of Cahors, Malbec is still found in small amounts as a permitted variety in the AOCs of Bergerac, Buzet, Côtes de Duras, Côtes du Marmandais, Fronton and Pécharmant. It is also permitted in the &quot;Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure&quot; (VDQS) of Côtes du Brulhois. In Le Midi region of the Languedoc, it is permitted (but rarely grown) in the AOC regions of Cabardès and Côtes de Malepère. There is a small amount of Malbec grown in the middle Loire Valley and permitted in the AOCs of Anjou, Coteaux du Loir, Touraine and the sparkling wine AOC of Saumur where it is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Gamay. Still, as elsewhere in France, Malbec is losing acreage to other varieties—most notably Cabernet Franc in the Loire.

Though the grape was historically a major planting in Bordeaux, providing color and fruit to its blends, in the 20th century it started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc. This was due, in part, to its vulnerabilities to so many different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). The severe 1956 frost wiped out a significant portion of Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties. By 1968, plantings in the Libournais were down to 4,900 hectares (12,100 acres) and fell further to 1,400 hectares (3,460 acres) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World &quot;meritages&quot; or Bordeaux blends, and although it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux has dwindled; the only significant plantings are in the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers.

===Argentina===
While acreage of the Malbec is declining in France, in Argentina the grape is surging and has become a &quot;national variety&quot; of a sort that is uniquely identified with Argentine wine. The grape was first introduced to the region in the mid 19th century when provincial governor Domingo Faustino Sarmiento instructed the French agronomist Michel Pouget to bring grapevine cuttings from France to Argentina. Among the vines that Pouget brought were the very first Malbec vines to be planted in the country. During the economic turmoil of the 20th century, some plantings of Malbec were pulled out to make way for the jug wine producing varieties of Criolla Grande and Cereza. The grape was rediscovered in the late 20th century as the Argentine wine industry shifted its focus to premium wine production for export. As the Argentine wine industry discovered the unique quality of wine that could be made from the grape, Malbec arose to greater prominence and is today the most widely planted red grape variety in the country. As of 2003 there were over 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of Malbec in Argentina. The Mendoza region is the leading producer of Malbec in Argentina with plantings found throughout the country in places such as La Rioja, Salta, San Juan, Catamarca and Buenos Aires.

The grape clusters of Argentine Malbec are different from its French relatives, having smaller berries in tighter, smaller clusters. This suggests that the cuttings brought over by Pouget and later French immigrants were a unique clone that may have gone extinct in France due to frost and the phylloxera epidemic. Argentine Malbec wine is characterized by its deep color and intense fruity flavors with a velvety texture. While they lack the tannic structure of French Malbecs, being more plush in texture, Argentine Malbecs have shown aging potential similar to their French counterparts.

====High altitude Mendoza Malbec====
Argentina&#x27;s most highly rated Malbec wines originate from Mendoza&#x27;s high altitude wine regions of Luján de Cuyo and the Uco Valley. These districts are located in the foothills of the Andes mountains between 800 m and 1500 m elevation (2,800 to 5,000 feet).

Argentine vintner Nicolás Catena Zapata has been widely credited for elevating the status of Argentine Malbec and the Mendoza region through serious experimentation into the effects of high altitude. In 1994, he was the first to plant a Malbec vineyard at almost 1500 m (5,000 feet) elevation in the Gualtallary sub-district of Tupungato, the Adrianna Vineyard. He was also the first to develop a clonal selection of Argentine Malbec.

High-altitude Mendoza has attracted many notable foreign winemakers, such as Paul Hobbs, Michel Rolland, Herve Joyaux-Fabre, Roberto Cipresso and Alberto Antonini. Today, there are several Malbecs from the region scoring over 95 points in &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; and Robert Parker&#x27;s &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;.

=== Chile ===
Although Carménère is the emblematic strain of Chilean wine and other varieties of strains such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir among others are harvested in the country, Malbec has experienced exponential growth in its production during the last decades, due to the discovery of hundred-year-old vines of the variety, as well as the year-on-year increase in hectares planted for its exclusive production in the country. It is currently estimated that in Chile there are 2,361 hectares dedicated exclusively to the production of Malbec.

The history of malbec in Chile begins in 1841, when a group of French winemakers brought the vine to the country, along with other varieties to be planted in the Quinta Normal of Santiago, later in 1853 the first malbec strains would be exported from Chile to Argentina, specifically to the Mendoza region.

At the end of the century XIX, French winemakers began to expand Malbec plantations to other regions of the central-south zone of Chile, however they mixed them with other varieties, so the production of Malbec gradually faded over the years, as was the case in the Maule Region, since centenary Malbec vines that had been mixed with other vines were discovered a few years ago in the area. It was not until 1993 that the Viu Manent vineyard became the first Chilean winery to produce, bottle and market 100% Malbec wines produced in the country, from the vineyard they had for more than 100 years in the city of Santa Cruz in the Colchagua where this variety was found. In 2016, a hundred-year-old Malbec plantation was also discovered in the city of San Rosendo, in the Biobío Region, which was brought to the area by French settlers at the end of the 19th century, which had also been blended with other vines from the area.

Currently, the largest amount of Malbec production in Chile is located in the Maule Region, however there are also important plantations of the strain in the Biobío regions and in the Colchagua Valley area. The Terroir of the Maule Region is granitic, which causes the malbec of the area to contain a special minerality, in addition the influence of the coast and the mountains give acidity and freshness to the Chilean malbec, these conditions cause an important difference in its par Also, Chilean Malbec tends to have a fresher and more fruity flavor, because it is not harvested as ripe as other Malbec productions in the world.

===United States===

Prior to Prohibition in the United States, Malbec was a significant variety in California used mainly for blended bulk wine production. After Prohibition, the grape was a minor variety until it experienced a surge of interest as a component of &quot;Meritage&quot; Bordeaux-style blends in the mid-1990s. Between 1995 and 2003, plantings of Malbec in California increased from 404 hectares (1,000 acres) to more than 2,830 hectares (7000 acres). While the appearance of Californian varietal Malbec is increasing, the grape is still most widely used for blending. In California, the American Viticultural Areas (AVA) with the most plantings of Malbec include Napa Valley, Alexander Valley, Paso Robles and Sonoma Valley.

Other regions in California with some plantings of Malbec include Livermore Valley, Atlas Peak, Carmel Valley, Los Carneros, Ramona Valley, Central Coast, Red Hills Lake County, Chalk Hill, Clear Lake, Diamond Mountain District, Russian River Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Rutherford, El Dorado, San Lucas, Santa Clara Valley, Santa Cruz Mountains, Santa Lucia Highlands, Santa Maria Valley, Santa Ynez Valley, Howell Mountain, Sierra Foothills, Knights Valley, Spring Mountain District, St. Helena, Lodi, Stags Leap District, Madera, Suisun Valley, Temecula Valley, Monterey, Mount Veeder, North Coast, Oak Knoll District,
Yorkville Highlands, Oakville, Paicines, Clements Hills, Fair Play, Willow Creek, North Yuba, and Yountville.

Seven Hills Winery planted the first vines of Malbec planted in Oregon state in the late 1990s in their Windrow vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. Since the turn of the 21st century, several wineries have been experimenting with 100% varietal Malbec as well as using the variety in Meritage blends. In Washington state it is grown predominately in the Columbia Valley and the sub-AVAs of Walla Walla Valley, Rattlesnake Hills, Red Mountain, Wahluke Slope, Horse Heaven Hills and Yakima Valley. Elsewhere in Washington State, Malbec is planted in the Lake Chelan AVA where it has consistently produced wines of exceptional quality.

Other AVAs in the United States producing Malbec include the Ohio appellation of Grand River Valley, the New York appellations of North Fork of Long Island and Finger Lakes; the Oregon appellations of Applegate Valley, Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Umpqua Valley and Willamette Valley; the Idaho appellation of the Snake River Valley; the Texas appellations of Texas High Plains and Texas Hill Country; the Virginia appellations of Monticello and North Fork of Roanoke; the North Carolina appellation of the Yadkin Valley; the Michigan appellations of the Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula; the New Jersey appellation of the Outer Coastal Plain and the high altitude, Colorado appellation of the Grand Valley. Additionally, there are some plantings in Missouri and Georgia outside of federally delineated appellations.

===Other regions===

The success of Malbec led some producers in Chile to try their hand at the varietal. Grown throughout the Central Valley, Chilean Malbec tends to be more tannic than its counterpart and is used primarily in Bordeaux-style blends. In 2016 a budget-priced La Moneda Reserve Malbec from the UK supermarket chain Asda won the Platinum Best in Show prize in a blind tasting at the Decanter World Wine awards.

The grapevine was introduced to Australia in the 19th century and was mostly a bulk wine producing grape. The particular clones planted in Australia were of poor quality and highly susceptible to coulure, frost and downy mildew. By the mid to late 20th century, many acres of Malbec were uprooted and planted with different varieties. By 2000, there were slightly over 1,235 acres (500 hectares), with the Clare Valley and Langhorne Creek having the most significant amount. As newer clones become available, plantings of Malbec in Australia have increased slightly.

Other regions with some plantings of Malbec include Northern Italy, New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa, British Columbia, Ontario, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Southern Indiana, and Israel.

==Wine==
Wine expert Jancis Robinson describes the French style of Malbec common in the Libournais (Bordeaux region) as a &quot;rustic&quot; version of Merlot, softer in tannins and lower in acidity with blackberry fruit in its youth. The Malbec of the Cahors region is much more tannic with more phenolic compounds that contribute to its dark color. Oz Clarke describes Cahors&#x27; Malbec as dark purple in color with aromas of damsons, tobacco, garlic, and raisin. In Argentina, Malbec becomes softer with a plusher texture and riper tannins. The wines tend to have juicy fruit notes with violet aromas. In very warm regions of Argentina and Australia, the acidity of the wine may be too low which can cause a wine to taste flabby and weak. Malbec grown in Washington state tends to be characterized by dark fruit notes and herbal aromas. An exception to this in Washington State is Malbec grown in the high desert Lake Chelan AVA terroir. Malbec grapes grown in the glacial soils found within the Lake Chelan AVA produce wines possessing ripe raspberry - black fruit aromas and flavors with moderate acidity and tannins. The C R Sandidge Purtteman and Tsillan Cellars estate vineyards are known to produce stellar Malbec wines.

==Synonyms==

The French ampelographer Pierre Galet has documented over a thousand different synonyms for Malbec, stemming in part from its peak period when it was growing in 30 different departments of France. While Malbec is the name most commonly known to wine drinkers, Galet suggest that Côt was most likely the grape variety&#x27;s original name and the frequent appearance of &quot;Auxerrois&quot; as a synonym suggests the northern reaches of Burgundy as being the possible home of the varietal. In Bordeaux, where the variety first gained attention, it was known under the synonym &quot;Pressac&quot;.

Other common synonyms for Malbec include Agreste, Auxerrois, Auxerrois De Laquenexy, Auxerrois Des Moines De Picpus, Auxerrois Du Mans, Balouzat, Beran, Blanc De Kienzheim, Cahors, Calarin, Cauli, Costa Rosa, Côt, Cot A Queue Verte, Cotes Rouges, Doux Noir, Estrangey, Gourdaux, Grelot De Tours, Grifforin, Guillan, Hourcat, Jacobain, Luckens, Magret, Malbek, Medoc Noir, Mouranne, Navarien, Negre De Prechac, Negrera, Noir De Chartres, Noir De Pressac, Noir Doux, Nyar De Presak, Parde, Périgord, Pied De Perdrix, Pied Noir, Pied Rouge, Pied Rouget, Piperdy, Plant D&#x27;Arles, Plant De Meraou, Plant du Lot, Plant Du Roi, Prechat, Pressac, Prunieral, Quercy, Queue Rouge, Quille De Coy, Romieu, Teinturin, Terranis, Vesparo.

<text>The Grand Slam in professional golf is winning all of golf&#x27;s major championships in the same calendar year. The only player who has accomplished a similar feat is Bobby Jones in 1930, winning the four major tournaments of that era open to amateurs: the British Amateur, the British Open, the United States Open, and the United States Amateur. Modern variations include a Career Grand Slam: winning all of the major tournaments within a player&#x27;s career and the Tiger Slam: winning four consecutive major titles but not in the same calendar year (named after Tiger Woods, the only player to accomplish the feat).

==Men&#x27;s golf==

The Grand Slam in men&#x27;s golf is an unofficial term for winning all four major championships in the same year.

In the modern era, the Grand Slam requires victories in four tournaments in a single calendar year (listed in current playing order):
# Masters Tournament, held the week ending on the 2nd Sunday in April – hosted as an invitational by and played at Augusta National Golf Club
# PGA Championship (also known as the &quot;United States PGA Championship&quot; or &quot;USPGA&quot;), held the week ending on the 3rd Sunday in May, one week before Memorial Day weekend – hosted by the PGA of America and played at various locations in the United States. Prior to 2019, it was held in mid-August, three weeks before Labor Day weekend.
# U.S. Open, held the week ending on the 3rd Sunday in June – hosted by the USGA and played at various locations in the United States.
# The Open Championship (&quot;The Open&quot;, sometimes called &quot;the British Open&quot; outside the UK), held the week containing the 3rd Friday in July – hosted by The R&amp;A and always played on a links course at one of several predetermined locations in the United Kingdom on a rota basis.

Prior to the creation of the Masters Tournament, the national amateur championships of the U.S. and the UK were considered major championships. During that earlier era, the Grand Slam comprised consecutive victories at the U.S. Amateur, The Amateur Championship (British Amateur) along with the U.S. Open and the Open Championship.

Only Bobby Jones completed an original Grand Slam, in 1930.

The term &quot;Grand Slam&quot; was first applied to Bobby Jones&#x27; achievement of winning the four major golf events of 1930 open to amateurs: The Open Championship (containing pros and amateurs), the U.S. Open (containing pros and amateurs), the U.S. Amateur (containing amateurs only), and the British Amateur (containing amateurs only). When Jones won all four, the sports world searched for ways to capture the magnitude of his accomplishment. Up to that time, there was no term for such a feat because no one had thought it possible. The &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;″s O. B. Keeler dubbed it the &quot;Grand Slam,&quot; borrowing a bridge term. George Trevor of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; wrote that Jones had &quot;stormed the impregnable quadrilateral of golf.&quot; Keeler would later write the words that would forever be linked to one of the greatest individual accomplishments in the history of sports:
This victory, the fourth major title in the same season and in the space of four months, had now and for all time entrenched Bobby Jones safely within the &#x27;Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf,&#x27; that granite fortress that he alone could take by escalade, and that others may attack in vain, forever.

The modern definition of four majors open to pros and amateurs could not be applied until at least 1934, when the Masters was founded, and still carried little weight in 1953 when Ben Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship. That year, it was impossible to win all four as the PGA Championship preceded and overlapped with the Open Championship; the PGA&#x27;s 36-hole match play semifinals and finals near Detroit were the same days as the mandatory 36-hole qualifier at Carnoustie in Scotland for the Open Championship; the only way to compete in both events was to lose an early match at the PGA. Hogan is the only player to have won the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship in the same calendar year.

In 1960, Arnold Palmer won the Masters in April and U.S. Open in June. According to his autobiography, &quot;A Golfer&#x27;s Life&quot;, he and his friend Bob Drum (of the Pittsburgh Press), while on the trans-Atlantic flight to The Open Championship at St Andrews, came up with the idea that adding it and the PGA Championship titles that July would constitute a modern Grand Slam. Drum spread the notion among the gathered media and it caught on. However, a newspaper article on 12 April 1960 titled &quot;Biggest Grand Slam May Be Palmer Goal&quot; stated &quot;Arnold Palmer, the Midas of the fairways, has charted a course which could carry him to the biggest grand slam in golf since Bobby Jones&#x27; feat in 1930. The Pennsylvania strongman with golfdom&#x27;s golden touch passed his first landmark when he won the 24th Masters tournament yesterday with a pulsating stretch drive. Three more big ones remain- the U.S. Open in Denver June 16-18, the 100th anniversary British Open at historic St. Andrews July 4-9 and the PGA championship in Akron, Ohio, July 28-31. If the 29-year-old Palmer can add those three jewels to his Masters crown the performance will rank on a par with Jones&#x27; grand slam year.&quot; Two years earlier, the PGA had changed to stroke play, and it started to be held two weeks after the Open Championship in 1960. Scheduling problems continued through the 1960s as the last two majors were held in successive weeks in July on five occasions. The PGA was played in August in 1965 but returned to July for the next three. With the formation of the Tournament Players Division in late 1968, now the PGA Tour, the PGA Championship moved to August in 1969 and, except for the 1971 edition, held in late February to avoid the summer heat of Florida, continued to be held during that month until 2018. From 2019 it is held in May.

Tiger Woods came closest to winning a modern Grand Slam by holding all four major titles at the same time. He won all four major championships consecutively — the U.S. Open, Open Championship, and PGA Championship in 2000, and the 2001 Masters — but not in the same calendar year. This has been called the &quot;Tiger Slam&quot;. In fact, even before Woods accomplished this, there was much debate over the definition of &quot;Grand Slam.&quot; Fred Couples said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I can put it more simply . . . if he wins all four, it&#x27;s a Slam.&quot;

Only five golfers have won all four of golf&#x27;s modern majors at any time during their careers, an achievement which is often referred to as a &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot;: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods. Woods and Nicklaus have won each of the four majors at least three times. The term also refers to a former tour tournament, the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, an annual off-season tournament, that was cancelled after the 2014 tournament, contested by the winners of the four major championships.

==Women&#x27;s golf==

Women&#x27;s golf also has a set of majors. No woman has completed a calendar year four-major Grand Slam, but Babe Zaharias won all three majors contested in 1950 and Sandra Haynie won both majors in 1974.

Seven women have completed the Career Grand Slam by winning four different majors. There are variations in the set of four tournaments involved as the players played in different eras, and the women&#x27;s tournaments defined as &quot;majors&quot; have varied considerably over time in a way that has not been paralleled in the men&#x27;s game. The seven are Pat Bradley, Juli Inkster, Inbee Park, Annika Sörenstam, Louise Suggs, Karrie Webb, and Mickey Wright. Webb is separately recognized by the LPGA as its only &quot;Super Career Grand Slam&quot; winner, for she is the only one of the group to have won five different tournaments recognized as majors.

Although other women&#x27;s tours, notably the Ladies European Tour (LET) and the LPGA of Japan Tour, recognize a different set of &quot;majors&quot;, the U.S. LPGA is so dominant in global women&#x27;s golf that the phrase &quot;women&#x27;s majors&quot;, without further qualification, is almost universally considered as a reference to the U.S. LPGA majors.

The five current major championships are:
# April—The Chevron Championship (week ending in the first Sunday of April)—Founded by Dinah Shore, it is most remembered for the winners taking a &quot;lake jump&quot; into the water surrounding the 18th green, also called the &quot;Green Jacket of the LPGA&quot; in reference to the ceremony held at the Masters Tournament. It shares another trait with the Masters—it is held at the same venue every year, The Club at Carlton Woods in The Woodlands, Texas since 2023.
# June—The U.S. Women&#x27;s Open (from 2019, ending on the first Sunday in June)—Hosted by the USGA, it is held at various golf courses around the nation. It is considered by some to be the biggest major in the LPGA circuit, despite the fact it is not sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour. It is held at various courses throughout the United States.
# June—The KPMG Women&#x27;s PGA Championship (from 2019, three weeks after the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open)—hosted by the PGA of America since 2015 and played at various locations in the USA.
# July—The Evian Championship (week ending in the last Sunday of July)—an event held in France that was historically known as the Evian Masters and became the LPGA&#x27;s fifth major championship in 2013. The tournament has been an LET major since its inception in 1994, and was sanctioned as a regular LPGA tour event from 2000 to 2012. Before 2019, it had been held in September.
# August—The AIG Women&#x27;s Open (week of the first Sunday of August)—It is hosted by The R&amp;A, which absorbed the event&#x27;s former operator, the Ladies&#x27; Golf Union, in late 2016. Unlike the men&#x27;s Open Championship, neither the LGU nor The R&amp;A has adopted a links-only course policy, although the event has most commonly been held on links courses in the 21st century. 2007 marked the first time it was held at what is considered by many to be the greatest golf course in the world, and certainly the most historic, the Old Course at St Andrews. In 2009, it was moved to a date three weeks after the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. The 2012 edition was held in September to avoid conflict with the 2012 Summer Olympics in London; in 2013, it returned to its then-current July/August date; and in 2019, it was fixed to be the week after The Evian Championship. Before 2013, this was the only championship sanctioned as a major by both the LPGA and the LET.

&lt;br&gt;A Inbee Park is recognized as achieving the career Grand Slam for winning four different major championships, even though The Evian Championship had since been designated as the fifth major championship.

==Senior golf==
Senior (i.e., 50 and over) men&#x27;s golf also has a set of majors. Like the women&#x27;s majors, the senior majors are not globally recognized. However, because the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions overwhelmingly dominates worldwide senior golf, its roster of majors is by far the most widely recognized.

Unlike the mainstream men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s (until 2013) Grand Slams, the senior version (as recognized by PGA Tour Champions) now contains five events.

In the current order of play, the five majors are:
# The Tradition (ending on the third or fourth Sunday in May, depending on the calendar)
# Senior PGA Championship (one week after The Tradition; ending the day before the U.S. holiday of Memorial Day, observed on the last Monday of May)
# Senior Players Championship (ending on the last Sunday in June or the first Sunday in July, depending on the calendar)
# U.S. Senior Open (ending on the Sunday in July two weeks before The Senior Open Championship)
# The Senior Open Championship (ending on the last Sunday in July)

The Senior PGA is by far the oldest of the senior majors, having been founded in 1937, decades before the establishment of PGA Tour Champions (as the Senior PGA Tour) in 1980. The other events were all founded in the 1980s—the U.S. Senior Open in 1980, the Senior Players Championship in 1983, The Senior Open in 1987, and The Tradition in 1989. This era saw senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, reached their fifties. The Senior Open, however, was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until 2003.

The stability of the majors in senior golf falls somewhere between mainstream men&#x27;s golf and the LPGA:
* The roster of mainstream men&#x27;s majors has not changed since the concept of the professional &quot;Grand Slam&quot; was generally recognized. The number of tournaments recognized by the LPGA as majors, as well as the identity of these events, has varied considerably over the decades. Two tournaments that were once considered as LPGA majors no longer exist, and a third lost its major status but survives as a regular tour event. In senior golf, the number of majors has changed over the years, but always by the addition of a new major.
* In terms of in-season scheduling, the senior majors have been much less stable than those of mainstream men&#x27;s golf or the LPGA, especially in recent years. With the exception of a one-off staging of the PGA Championship in February 1971, the mainstream majors were held in the same order, and in almost exactly the same weeks of the year, from 1969 to 2018, after which the PGA Championship moved to the weekend before Memorial Day. In women&#x27;s golf, the scheduling of the majors has stabilized in recent years, with occasional minor changes of dates but no change of order. However, in senior golf, the order of the majors has changed five times since 2006. The Senior Players Championship, held in July in 2006, moved to October in 2007, August in 2011, and to late June/early July in 2012. The Tradition, previously held in late August, moved to early May in 2011, mid-June in 2012, and mid-May in 2013. The U.S. Senior Open moved from mid-July to August in 2008; it returned to mid-July in 2012. The Senior PGA Championship and The Senior Open have retained their dates (respectively late May and late July) throughout this period.

No man has ever won all of the senior majors contested in a year, even in the period between 1980 and 1982 when only two senior majors existed. Bernhard Langer is the only man to have won all five of the current senior majors in his career, having completed the career Slam by winning both the Senior PGA Championship and Senior Open Championship in 2017. Miller Barber won both of the 1980-1982 senior majors, the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open, during that time span, and won the inaugural Senior Players Championship in 1983. Those three tournaments would be the only senior majors until The Tradition was first played in 1989. Prior to the founding of The Tradition, Palmer and Player also completed that era&#x27;s Career Senior Grand Slam. However, neither Barber, Palmer, nor Player would ever win The Tradition.

Jack Nicklaus is the only other player to have completed any era&#x27;s Career Senior Grand Slam, doing so in his first two years on the Senior Tour. In his first year of eligibility in 1990, he won The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship. The next year, he defended his Tradition title and went on to win the Senior PGA and U.S. Senior Open. However, he failed to defend his Senior Players title and thus missed out on a calendar-year Grand Slam.

Langer and Nicklaus are the only players to have won four or more different senior majors in their careers. Although Nicklaus never won The Senior Open, that event was not recognized as a U.S. senior major until 2003, which was also the only year he played the event. Player won The Senior Open three times before 2003, when it was considered a major by the European Senior Tour but not the circuit now known as PGA Tour Champions.

<doc id="224582" wikidata="Q1267489" url="?curid=224582" title="Redwood Shores, California">
<text>Redwood Shores is a waterfront community in Redwood City, California, along the western shore of San Francisco Bay on the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County. Redwood Shores is the home of several major technology companies, including Oracle Corporation (which relocated its headquarters in 2020), Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Zuora, Qualys, Crystal Dynamics and Shutterfly.

==History==
Redwood Shores was built up from reclaimed land in the marshes of San Francisco Bay in the 1960s, much like its neighbor, Foster City, but the development almost never came to be. The owner of the land, the Leslie Salt Company, filled in soft ground known as &quot;bay mud&quot; formerly used for salt-evaporation ponds, but a significant controversy developed over fears of its susceptibility to serious earthquake damage because the area is between and close to the San Andreas Fault and Hayward Fault. The ensuing battle between various government agencies and business interests eventually made Leslie Salt lose interest in the project. As a result, Bank of America became the owner of the development in 1972.

It was the home of the Marine World/Africa U.S.A., California theme park from the 1960s to 1986, when the park moved to Vallejo, California (eventually becoming Six Flags Discovery Kingdom). The former location of Marine World has evolved into homes, townhomes, condominiums, apartments, parks, preserved land, and Silicon Valley business parks with headquarters including the former headquarters of Oracle Corporation. In December 2020, Oracle announced that it had relocated its corporate headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.

==Geography==
Redwood Shores is located roughly halfway between San Francisco and San Jose, and is bordered by Belmont and San Carlos to the southwest. Foster City lies to the northwest and Bair Island to the southeast; both are separated from Redwood Shores by sloughs. To the northeast is San Francisco Bay.

===Climate===
==Economy==
Major technology companies maintain headquarters in Redwood Shores, among them Imperva and Electronic Arts. The community also includes a branch of Ernst &amp; Young, the West Coast office of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, and the headquarters of Relayware. For many years, Redwood Shores was the global headquarters of Oracle Corporation, until in December 2020 it announced its relocation to Austin, Texas.

==Infrastructure==
The Redwood Shores Branch of the Redwood City Public Library serves the community. To the south Redwood Shores is bordered by the San Carlos Airport.

Redwood Shores is the setting for college rowing races, including competitions among Pac-12 Conference universities.

==Education==
The community of Redwood Shores is served by the Belmont – Redwood Shores School District, which maintains the two schools located in Redwood Shores and five more schools in Belmont.

==Wildlife==
Pacific harbor seals have occasionally been spotted in the waterways and lagoons around Redwood Shores. The areas in and around the community are home to a variety of wildlife, including raccoons, skunks, ducks, geese, egrets, great blue herons, clapper rails, harvest field mice, stingrays, jellyfish, and many other species. Canada geese pose a nuisance and the community is actively working on reducing their presence.

<doc id="224584" wikidata="Q92747" url="?curid=224584" title="Eric Schmidt">
<text>Eric Emerson Schmidt (born April 27, 1955) is an American businessman and former computer engineer who was the chief executive officer of Google from 2001 to 2011 and the company&#x27;s executive chairman from 2011 to 2015. He also was the executive chairman of parent company Alphabet Inc. from 2015 to 2017, and technical advisor at Alphabet from 2017 to 2020. As of 2025, he&#x27;s the world&#x27;s 42nd wealthiest person according to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; with an estimated net worth of 39.0 billion.

As an intern at Bell Labs, Schmidt in 1975 was co-author of Lex, a software program to generate lexical analysers for the Unix computer operating system. In 1983, he joined Sun Microsystems and worked in various roles. From 1997 to 2001, he was chief executive officer (CEO) of Novell. Schmidt has been on various other boards in academia and industry, including the boards of trustees for Carnegie Mellon University, Apple, Princeton University, and the Mayo Clinic. He also owns a minority stake in the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL).

In 2008, during his tenure as Google&#x27;s chairman, Schmidt campaigned for Barack Obama, and subsequently became a member of Obama&#x27;s President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. In the meantime, Schmidt had left Google, and founded philanthropic venture Schmidt Futures, in 2017. Under his tenure, Schmidt Futures provided the compensation for two science-office employees in the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Schmidt became the first chair of the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in 2018, while keeping shares of Alphabet stock, worth over $5.3 billion in 2019. In October 2021, Schmidt founded the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) and has since served as its chairman. Schmidt had a major influence on the Biden administration&#x27;s science policy after 2021, especially shaping policies on AI.

==Early life and education==
Schmidt was born in Falls Church, Virginia, later moving to Blacksburg, Virginia. He is one of three sons of Eleanor, who had a master&#x27;s degree in psychology, and Wilson Emerson Schmidt, a professor of international economics at Virginia Tech and Johns Hopkins University, who worked at the U.S. Treasury Department during the Nixon Administration. Schmidt spent part of his childhood in Italy as a result of his father&#x27;s work and has stated that it had changed his outlook.

Schmidt graduated from Yorktown High School in the Yorktown neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, in 1972, after earning eight varsity letter awards in long-distance running. He attended Princeton University, starting as an architecture major and switching to electrical engineering, earning a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree in 1976.

From 1976 to 1980, Schmidt resided at the International House Berkeley, where he met his future wife, Wendy Boyle. In 1979, at the University of California, Berkeley, Schmidt earned an EECS M.S. degree for designing and implementing a network (Berknet) linking the campus computer center with the CS and EECS departments. There, he also earned a PhD degree in 1982 in EECS; Computer Engineering, with a dissertation about the problems of managing distributed software development and tools for solving these problems.

==Career==

===Early career===
Early in his career, Schmidt held a series of technical positions with IT companies including Byzromotti Design, Bell Labs (in research and development), Zilog, and Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).

During his summers at Bell Labs, he and Mike Lesk wrote Lex, a program used in compiler construction that generates lexical-analyzers from regular-expression descriptions.

===Sun Microsystems===
In 1983, Schmidt joined Sun Microsystems as its first software manager. He rose to become director of software engineering, vice president and general manager of the software products division, vice president of the general systems group, and president of Sun Technology Enterprises.

During his time at Sun, he was the target of two notable April Fool&#x27;s Day pranks. In the first, his office was taken apart and rebuilt on a platform in the middle of a pond, complete with a working phone and workstation on the corporate Ethernet network. The next year, a working Volkswagen Beetle was taken apart and re-assembled in his office.

===Novell===
In April 1997, Schmidt became the CEO and chairman of the board of Novell. He presided over a period of decline at Novell where its IPX protocol was being replaced by open TCP/IP products, while at the same time Microsoft was shipping free TCP/IP stacks in Windows 95, making Novell much less profitable. In 2001, he departed after the acquisition of Cambridge Technology Partners.

===Google===
Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin interviewed Schmidt. Impressed by him, they recruited Schmidt to run their company in 2001 under the guidance of venture capitalists John Doerr and Michael Moritz.

In March 2001, Schmidt joined Google&#x27;s board of directors as chair, and became the company&#x27;s CEO in August 2001. At Google, Schmidt shared responsibility for Google&#x27;s daily operations with founders Page and Brin. Prior to the Google initial public offering, Schmidt had responsibilities typically assigned to the CEO of a public company and focused on the management of the vice presidents and the sales organization. According to Google, Schmidt&#x27;s job responsibilities included &quot;building the corporate infrastructure needed to maintain Google&#x27;s rapid growth as a company and on ensuring that quality remains high while the product development cycle times are kept to a minimum.&quot;

Upon being hired at Google, Eric Schmidt was paid a salary of $250,000 and an annual performance bonus. He was granted 14,331,703 shares of Class B common stock at $0.30 per share and 426,892 shares of Series C preferred stock at purchase price of $2.34.

In 2004, Schmidt and the Google founders agreed to a base salary of US$1 (which continued through 2010) with other compensation of $557,465 in 2006, $508,763 in 2008, and $243,661 in 2009. He did not receive any additional stock or options in 2009 or 2010.
Most of his compensation was for &quot;personal security&quot; and charters of private aircraft.

In 2007, &quot;PC World&quot; ranked Schmidt as the first on its list of the 50 most important people on the Web, along with Google co-founders Page and Brin.

In its 2011 &#x27;World&#x27;s Billionaires&#x27; list, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Schmidt as the 136th-richest person in the world, with an estimated wealth of $7 billion.

On January 20, 2011, Google announced that Schmidt would step down as the CEO of Google but would take new title as executive chairman of the company and act as an adviser to co-founders Page and Brin. Google gave him a $100 million equity award in 2011 when he stepped down as CEO. On April 4, 2011, Page replaced Schmidt as the CEO.

On December 21, 2017, Schmidt announced he would be stepping down as the executive chairman of Alphabet. Schmidt stated that &quot;Larry, Sergey, Sundar and I all believe that the time is right in Alphabet&#x27;s evolution for this transition.&quot;

In February 2020, Schmidt left his post as technical advisor of Alphabet after 19 years with the company.

====Department of Defense====
In March 2016, it was announced that Schmidt would chair a new advisory board for the Department of Defense, titled the Defense Innovation Advisory Board. The advisory board serves as a forum connecting mainstays in the technology sector with those in the Pentagon.

To avoid potential conflicts of interest within the role, where Schmidt retained his role as technical adviser to Alphabet, and where Google&#x27;s bidding for the multi-million dollar Pentagon cloud contract, the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, was ongoing: Schmidt screened emails and other communications, stating, &quot;&#x27;There’s a rule: I&#x27;m not allowed to be briefed&#x27; about Google or Alphabet business as it relates to the Defense Department&quot;. He exited the position November 2020.

From 2019 to 2021, Schmidt co-chaired the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence with Robert O. Work.

==== Role in illegal non-recruiting agreements ====
While working at Google, Schmidt was involved in activities that later became the subject of the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation case that resulted in a settlement of $415 million paid by Adobe, Apple, Google and Intel to employees. In one incident, after receiving a complaint from Steve Jobs of Apple, Schmidt sent an email to Google&#x27;s HR department saying; &quot;I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request. Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks Eric&quot;. Schmidt&#x27;s email led to a recruiter for Google being &quot;terminated within the hour&quot; for not having adhered to the illegal scheme. Under Schmidt, there was a &quot;Do Not Call list&quot; of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google&#x27;s human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold-call agreements with competitors. Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared &quot;verbally, since I don&#x27;t want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?&quot;

== Philanthropy ==

=== Schmidt Family Foundation ===
The Schmidt Family Foundation was established in 2006 by Wendy Schmidt and Eric Schmidt to address issues of sustainability and the responsible use of natural resources.

Schmidt and his wife established the Eric &amp; Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellowship, a University of Chicago summer school program for aspiring data scientists.

The Schmidt Family Foundation&#x27;s subsidiaries include ReMain Nantucket and the Marine Science and Technology Foundation; its main charitable program is the 11th Hour Project. The foundation has also awarded grants to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Foundation.

The foundation is the main funder of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, which supports oceanographic research by operating the &quot;R/V Falkor (too)&quot; and previously the .

The Schmidts, working with Hart Howerton, a San Francisco architectural firm that specializes in large-scale land use, have inaugurated several projects on the island of Nantucket that seek to sustain the unique character of the island and to minimize the impact of seasonal visitation on the island&#x27;s core community.

Mrs. Schmidt offered the prize purse of the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE, a challenge award for the efficient capturing of crude oil from seawater motivated by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

The foundation also donated $10 million to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in 2015.

== Public positions ==

===Tax avoidance===

Schmidt has claimed that Google&#x27;s use of artificial distinctions to avoid paying billions of pounds in corporation tax otherwise owed by its UK operations is &quot;capitalism&quot; and that he was &quot;very proud of it&quot;.

===Privacy===
Publicly Schmidt stated that, as paraphrased by &quot;CNN&quot;/&quot;Money&quot;, &quot;there has to be a trade-off between privacy concerns and functionality.&quot; His explanations referenced &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Evil&quot;.

During an interview aired on December 3, 2009, on the CNBC documentary &quot;Inside the Mind of Google,&quot; Schmidt was asked, &quot;People are treating Google like their most trusted friend. Should they be?&quot; He replied: &quot;I think judgment matters. If you have something that you don&#x27;t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be doing it in the first place. But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time. And it&#x27;s important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that information could be made available to the authorities.&quot;

At the Techonomy conference on August 4, 2010, Schmidt expressed that technology is good. And he said that the only way to manage the challenges is &quot;much greater transparency and no anonymity.&quot; Schmidt also stated that in an era of asymmetric threats, &quot;true anonymity is too dangerous.&quot; However, at the 2013 Hay Festival, Schmidt expressed concern that sharing of personal information was too rampant and could have a negative effect, particularly on teenagers, stating that &quot;we have never had a generation with a full photographic, digital record of what they did&quot;, declaring that &quot;We have a point at which we [Google] forget information we know about you because it is the right thing to do. There are situations in life that it&#x27;s better that they don&#x27;t exist.&quot;

In 2013, Schmidt stated that the government surveillance in the United States was the &quot;nature of our society&quot; and that he was not going to &quot;pass judgment on that&quot;. However, on the revelation that the NSA has been secretly spying on Google&#x27;s data centers worldwide, he called the practice &quot;outrageous&quot; and criticized the NSA&#x27;s collection of Americans phone records.

=== Network neutrality ===

In August 2010, Schmidt clarified his company&#x27;s views on network neutrality: &quot;I want to be clear what we mean by Net neutrality: What we mean is if you have one data type like video, you don&#x27;t discriminate against one person&#x27;s video in favor of another. But it&#x27;s okay to discriminate across different types. So you could prioritize voice over video. And there is general agreement with Verizon and Google on that issue.&quot;

===Influence of Internet usage in North Korea===
In January 2013, Schmidt and Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas visited North Korea along with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson. The trip was highly publicized and controversial due to the ongoing tension between North Korea and the United States. On August 10, 2013, North Korea announced an indigenous smartphone, named Arirang, that may be using the Google Android operating system.

===Advocating open Internet use in Myanmar===
In March 2013, Schmidt visited Myanmar, which had been ruled by a military junta for decades and was transitioning to a democracy. During his visit, Schmidt spoke in favor of free and open Internet use in the country, and was scheduled to meet with the country&#x27;s president.

=== Technology advocacy ===
In January 2015, Schmidt and Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas, met with Pope Francis to discuss technology and society. This was the first meeting between the Pope and a technology leader, which was subsequently followed by other tech leaders visiting the Vatican.

=== Authored books and publications ===
====&quot;The New Digital Age&quot;====
In 2013, Schmidt and Jared Cohen, director of the Google Ideas think tank, published &quot;The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business&quot;, which discusses the geopolitical implications of increasingly widespread Internet use and access to information. The book was inspired by an essay in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine the two co-wrote in 2010. He also wrote the preface to &quot;The Startup Game: Inside the Partnership between Venture Capitalists and Entrepreneurs&quot;, by William H. Draper, III.

====&quot;How Google Works&quot;====
In 2014, Schmidt co-authored the New York Times best-selling book &quot;How Google Works&quot; with Jonathan Rosenberg, former Senior Vice President of Products at Google and current advisor to Google CEO Larry Page, and Alan Eagle. The book is a collection of the business management lessons learned over the course of Schmidt and Rosenberg&#x27;s time leading Google. In his book, Eric Schmidt argues that successful companies in the technology-driven internet age should attract smart and creative employees and create an environment where they can thrive. He argues that the traditional business rules that make a company successful have changed; companies should maximize freedom and speed, and decision-making should not lie in the hands of the few. Schmidt also emphasizes that individuals and small teams can have a massive impact on innovation.

==== &quot;The Age of AI: And Our Human Future&quot; ====
In 2021, Schmidt co-authored &quot;The Age of AI: And Our Human Future&quot; with Henry Kissinger and Daniel Huttenlocher.

=== Schmidt&#x27;s Law ===
Dating back to early 1990s and dubbed &quot;Schmidt&#x27;s Law&quot; by George Gilder when Schmidt predicted that the network will become the computer. Schmidt&#x27;s Law states: &quot;When the network becomes as fast as the backplane of your computer, the computer hollows out, its components dispersing across the Web, its value migrating to search and sort functions.&quot;

=== Social networking services ===
In October 2020, Schmidt stated that social networking services are &quot;amplifiers for idiots and crazy people&quot; and that this was not what the Big Tech firms intended when creating them.

=== Silicon Valley entrepreneurship ===
During a 2024 interview with Stanford University students, Schmidt commented on Silicon Valley&#x27;s probable use of AI in the future, commenting that a hypothetical startup company could release a product that infringes on intellectual property, and simply hire lawyers to solve any legal problems if it became successful. This concept was compared to the Silicon Valley mentality of &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, which had recently led to lawsuits against OpenAI.

==Other work==

===Art collection===
Schmidt was on the list of ARTnews&#x27;s 200 top art collectors in 2008. Schmidt denied that he was an art collector, despite his involvement in art, in 2019.

===Bilderberg Group===
He is a member of the Bilderberg Group and attends the annual Bilderberg conferences regularly. He also has a listed membership with the Trilateral Commission.

===Berggruen Institute===
Schmidt is an active member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council, and its board of directors.

===Acting===

In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot;, starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. He also had a cameo appearance in the HBO show &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

==Personal life==
In June 1980, Schmidt married Wendy Susan Boyle (born 1955 in Short Hills, New Jersey). They lived in Atherton, California, in the 1990s. They have a daughter, Sophie, and had another, Alison, who died in 2017 from an illness. A number of Schmidt&#x27;s extramarital relationships have attracted publicity, but he and his wife continue joint philanthropic efforts.

In January 2013, Schmidt visited North Korea with his daughter Sophie, Jared Cohen, and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson.

In 2015, Schmidt acquired a 20% stake in D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.. Schmidt is also an investor in CargoMetrics, another quant hedge fund.

In April 2015, Schmidt delivered the commencement address at Virginia Tech, located in Schmidt&#x27;s childhood home of Blacksburg, Virginia. This came on the heels of Schmidt making a $2 million donation to Virginia Tech&#x27;s College of Engineering. Schmidt&#x27;s philanthropy is the result of his longstanding friendship with Virginia Tech&#x27;s former president Paul Torgersen. His donation funded the Paul and Dorothea Torgersen Dean&#x27;s Chair in Engineering.

In September 2020, Schmidt purchased Montecito Mansion, a 22,000-square-foot estate overlooking Santa Barbara, for $30.8 million.

In November 2020, &quot;Recode&quot; reported that Schmidt was finalizing his plan to become a citizen of Cyprus. He is one of the highest-profile people to take advantage of the immigrant investor programs that offers a &quot;passport-for-sale&quot;. This passport can be used to enter and live in any country of the European Union.

In 2024, Bloomberg estimated his net worth to be 37.8 billion. In 2024, Schmidt was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to philanthropy.

In 2023 and 2024, CO2 emissions from flights taken by Schmidt&#x27;s Gulfstream 650 jet placed him at the top of lists of private jet owners who generated the most carbon emissions.

<text>Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two to four players each on a sand court divided by a net. Similar to indoor volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent&#x27;s side of the court. Each team also works in unison to prevent the opposing team from grounding the ball on their side of the court.

Teams are allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after a touch off an attempted block. Making a block touch leaves only two more touches before the ball must be hit over. The ball is put in play with a serve—a hit by the server from behind the rear court boundary over the net to the opponents. The receiving team typically uses their three touches to pass the ball, set it up for an attack, and then attack the ball by sending it back over the net. Meanwhile, the team on defense typically has a blocker at the net and a defender to cover the ground. The rally continues until the ball is grounded on the playing court, goes &quot;out&quot;, or a fault is made in the attempt to return the ball. The team that wins the rally scores a point and serves to start the following rally. The players serve in the same sequence throughout the match, changing server each time a rally is won by the receiving team.

Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, while the modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica, California, where the first volleyball courts were put up on the beach. It has been an Olympic sport since the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) is the international governing body for the sport, and organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.
==History==

Beach volleyball is a variant of indoor volleyball, which was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan. Beach volleyball most likely originated in 1915 on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, at the Outrigger Canoe Club. According to a 1978 interview with an Outrigger Canoe Club member, George David &quot;Dad&quot; Center put a net up there, and the first recorded game of beach volleyball took place. In 1920, new jetties in Santa Monica, California created a large sandy area for public enjoyment. This planted the seed for beach volleyball development in that region. The first permanent nets began to appear, and people soon began playing recreational games on public parts of the beach and in private beach clubs. Eleven such beach clubs appeared in the Santa Monica area, beginning in late 1922. The first inter-club competitions were staged in 1924.

Most of these early beach volleyball matches were played with teams of at least six players per side, much like indoor volleyball. The concept of the modern two-man beach volleyball game is credited to Paul &quot;Pablo&quot; Johnson of the Santa Monica Athletic Club. In the summer of 1930, while waiting for players to show up for a six-man game at the Santa Monica Athletic Club, Johnson decided to try playing with only the four people present, forming two two-man teams for the first recorded beach volleyball doubles game. The players realized that with fewer players on the court, a taller player&#x27;s height advantage could be neutralized by a shorter player&#x27;s speed and ball control. The popularity of the two-man game spread to other nearby beach clubs and eventually to the public courts. The two-player version of the game is the most widely played version as well as the only one contested at an elite level.

Beach volleyball grew in popularity in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s as it was an inexpensive activity. The sport also began to appear in Europe during this time. By the 1940s, doubles tournaments were being played on the beaches of Santa Monica for trophies. In 1948 the first tournament to offer a prize was held in Los Angeles. It awarded the best teams with a case of Pepsi. In the 1960s, an attempt to start a professional volleyball league was made in Santa Monica. It failed, but a professional tournament was held in France for 30,000 French francs. In the 1950s, the first Brazilian beach volleyball tournament was held, sponsored by a newspaper publishing company. The first Manhattan Beach Open was held in 1960, a tournament which grew in prestige to become, in the eyes of some, the &quot;Wimbledon of Beach Volleyball&quot;.
In the meantime, beach volleyball gained popularity: in the 1960s The Beatles tried playing in Los Angeles and US president John F. Kennedy was seen attending a match. In 1974, there was an indoor tournament: &quot;The $1500.00 World Indoor Two-Man Volleyball Championship&quot; played in front of 4,000 volleyball enthusiast at the San Diego Sports Arena. Fred Zuelich teamed with Dennis Hare to defeat Ron Von Hagen and Matt Gage in the championship match, Winston Cigarettes was the sponsor. Dennis Hare went on to write the first book on the subject of beach volleyball: &quot;The Art of Beach Volleyball&quot;.

The first professional beach volleyball tournament was the Olympia World Championship of Beach Volleyball, staged on Labor Day weekend, 1976, at Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades, California. The event was organized by David Wilk of &quot;Volleyball&quot; magazine, based in Santa Barbara. The winners, the first &quot;world champions&quot;, were Greg Lee and Jim Menges. They split US$2,500 out of a total prize purse of US$5,000.

&quot;Volleyball&quot; magazine staged the event the next year at the same location, this time sponsored by Schlitz Light Beer. In 1978 Wilk formed a sports promotion company named Event Concepts with Craig Masuoka and moved the World Championship of Beach Volleyball to Redondo Beach, California. Jose Cuervo signed on as sponsor and the prize purse. The event was successful and Cuervo funded an expansion the next year to three events. The California Pro Beach Tour debuted with events in Laguna Beach, Santa Barbara and the World Championship in Redondo.

In following years the tour expanded nationally and was renamed the Pro Beach Volleyball Tour. It consisted of five events in California and tournaments in Florida, Colorado, and Chicago. By 1984, the Pro Beach consisted of 16 events around the country and had a total prize purse of US$300,000. At the end of the year, however, Event Concepts was forced out of the sport by a players&#x27; strike at the World Championship and the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) was founded. In 1987 the Women&#x27;s Professional Volleyball Association was founded and lasted until 1997 when the women joined the AVP tour.
At the professional level, the sport remained fairly obscure until the 1980s when beach volleyball experienced a surge in popularity with high-profile players such as Sinjin Smith, Randy Stoklos, and Karch Kiraly. Kiraly won an Olympic gold medal in beach volleyball in its first Olympic appearance in 1996, adding that to the two Olympic golds he won as part of the USA men&#x27;s indoor team, In the 1980s, the sport gained popularity on the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1986, the first international beach volleyball exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro with 5,000 spectators.

In 1987, the first international FIVB-sanctioned tournament was played on Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro, with a prize purse of US$22,000. It was won by Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos. In 1989, the first FIVB-sanctioned international circuit, called the World Series, was organized with men&#x27;s tournaments in Brazil, Italy and Japan. The FIVB and its continental confederations began organizing worldwide professional tournaments and laid the groundwork for the sport&#x27;s Olympic debut in 1996. The first FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships and FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour were held the following year. By 1998, the sport had been added to other multi-sport events including the Pan American Games, Central American Games, Southeast Asian Games, Goodwill Games and Universiade. In 2001, the FIVB began organizing the annual FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championships, with the annual FIVB Beach Volleyball U19 World Championships beginning the following year.

==Rules==
The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) is the international governing body for the sport. The FIVB publishes the Official Beach Volleyball Rules every four years, as approved by the FIVB congress, which provides the framework for how beach volleyball is played internationally. The rules have changed through the years: the court size became smaller, side out scoring was replaced by rally scoring and let serves were allowed. Beach volleyball differs from indoor, especially in requiring &quot;clean hands&quot; while setting. In other words, both of your hands have to contact the ball during the set at the same time. The ball can also not be caught or thrown, otherwise, the referee will call your set a &quot;double&quot; or &quot;lift&quot;.

===Court===

Beach volleyball is played on a rectangular sand court. The court is long and wide, surrounded by a clear space, which is at least wide on all sides. The minimum height clearance for beach volleyball courts is . The sand should be as leveled as possible and free of potential hazards such as rocks that could cause injuries to players.

The court is divided into equal halves by a net that is long and wide. The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11 11⁄16 in) above the center of the court for men&#x27;s competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4 3⁄16 in) for women&#x27;s competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions. An antenna, long and in diameter, is attached to each side edge of the net.
The antennae are considered part of the net and extend above it, forming the lateral boundaries within which the ball is allowed to cross.

Two side lines and two end lines, measuring wide, delineate the playing court.

===Ball===
FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical and made of water resistant, flexible material, such that it is appropriate for outdoor conditions. A beach volleyball ball has a circumference of 66–68 cm, a weight of 260–280 g and an inside pressure of 0.175–0.225 kg/cm2. In 2022, the official ball of the AVP (Association of Volleyball Professionals) tour is the Wilson OPTX AVP, and the official ball of the FIVB (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball) beach volleyball tour is the Mikasa VLS300. This ball was replaced with the new Mikasa Beach Pro BV550C, and was introduced in 2023.

A team is composed exclusively of two players, who must always be in play and who cannot be subjected to any substitutions or replacement. At the moment the ball is hit by the server, each team must be within its own court (with the exception of the server), but there are no determined positions on the court, such that no positional faults can be committed.

===Scoring===
====Point, set, match====
A team scores a point when: the ball lands on the opposing team&#x27;s court; the opposing team hits the ball &quot;out&quot;; the opposing team commits a fault; or the opposing team receives a penalty. The team that won the point serves for the next point. The ball is considered &quot;out&quot; if it: lands on the ground completely outside the boundary lines (a ball is &quot;in&quot; if any part of it touches a sideline or end-line); touches an object or person (who is not a player) outside the court; touches the net&#x27;s antennae; does not cross the net&#x27;s lateral boundaries (within the antennae) during service or during a team&#x27;s third contact; crosses completely under the net.

A set is won by the first team to reach 21 points (15 points in the deciding final set) with a two-point advantage. Thus, if the score is 20–all (or 14–all in a final set) or at any tie hereafter, whoever scores two straight points wins. A match is won by whoever wins two sets.

====Faults====

A fault is committed when a referee judges that a team has made a playing action that violates the rules. When a team commits a fault, the opposing team receives a point and gains the right to serve. If both teams commit a fault simultaneously, the point is replayed. Common faults include:
*Four hits: when a team uses more than three contacts before returning the ball over the net
*Assisted hit: a player uses a teammate or any object as support to hit the ball within the playing area
*Double contact: when a player contacts the ball two times consecutively, except after a block touch
*Catch/lift: a player catches or throws the ball
*Service order fault: a team serves out of the service order
*Foot fault: a player&#x27;s foot touches the court (including the end line) before or during a service hit
*Net touch: a player touches the net between the antennae or the antenna itself while playing the ball

===Major rule changes===
In the 1990s, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball reduced the standard internal pressure for a beach volleyball ball from the indoor standard of 0.30–0.325 kgf/cm2 to 0.175–0.225 kgf/cm2, and increased the standard circumference of the beach volleyball ball from the indoor standard of 65–67 cm to 66–68 cm.

In the 2001 season, the FIVB began testing rule changes to the court size and scoring system. The beach volleyball court dimension was reduced from the indoor court size of to , and the scoring system was changed from sideout scoring, wherein only the serving team can score a point, to rally scoring, wherein a point is scored on every serve. The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) adopted the FIVB&#x27;s rule changes that same year, which upset many of the sport&#x27;s purists at the time. The new rules were officially adopted by the FIVB in 2002.

===Differences with the indoor game===

Beach volleyball is fundamentally similar to indoor volleyball. However, there are several differences between the two games that affect players&#x27; strategies, gameplay and techniques.

The main differences in the rules of beach and indoor volleyball for international competitions governed by the FIVB include:
;Facilities and equipment
*Playing surface: Beach volleyball is played on sand courts instead of hard courts as in indoor volleyball. The softer sand makes it more difficult for players to move and jump, but also reduces the likelihood of injuries such as jumper&#x27;s knee. Footwear is not required and players usually play barefoot or with &quot;sand socks&quot;.
*Environment: The beach game is often played outdoors, and environmental factors such as wind, rain and sun affect beach players&#x27; strategies.
*Court size: A beach volleyball court is , slightly smaller than the indoor court.
*Balls: Beach volleyball balls are water-resistant and slightly larger than indoor balls, with a rougher external texture and a lower internal pressure to better suit the outdoor playing conditions.
;Participants
*Number of players: There are two players on a beach volleyball team and no substitutions, compared to indoor volleyball which has six players and six substitutions per set. This means that beach volleyball players require a versatile skill set, as opposed to specializing in one skill. Fewer players on court also results in the utilization of a wider variety of attack shots in beach volleyball.
*Coaching during matches is not allowed, although exceptions are given for junior tournaments and can only occur when switching sides.
*Aside from alternating service order, there are no player-specific rules
**No restrictions on which players can attack from which locations (as for back-row players or liberos in indoor volleyball)
**No positional faults: players may switch positions at will

;Playing format
*Scoring system: Matches are best of 3 sets played to 21 points (15 points for a deciding set).
*Switching sides: Teams switch ends of the court every seven points (every five points on a deciding set). This ensures that neither team has an advantage due to environmental factors such as wind and sun glare.
;Playing actions
*Open hand tips and dinks are not allowed in two-man beach volleyball as they would allow players to score points too easily.
*A touch off the block counts as one of the three allowed touches, and either player may make the subsequent touch after the block.
*It is legal to cross under the net as long as it does not interfere with opponents&#x27; play.
*A ball set over the net as an attack must travel perpendicularly to the player&#x27;s shoulder line.
*Each team has one time out per set, and there is an official time out in first and second sets when the score sums up 21 total points for both teams.

==Gameplay==

The teams start on opposite sides of the net. One team is designated the &quot;serving&quot; team and opposing team is the &quot;receiving&quot; team. A coin toss is conducted by the referee before the warm-ups to determine which team serves first and which sides of the court the teams start on for the first two sets. If a third deciding set is needed, another coin toss will be conducted prior to the third set. The service order decided at the coin toss before a set is maintained throughout the set.

For each point, a player from the serving team initiates the &quot;serve&quot; by tossing the ball into the air and attempting to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team&#x27;s court. The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the ball to return the ball to the opponent&#x27;s side of the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after a block touch. The three contacts usually consist first of the &quot;bump&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; by the receiving player, second of the &quot;set&quot; by the receiving player&#x27;s teammate so that the ball&#x27;s trajectory is aimed towards a spot where the receiving player can hit it, and third by the receiving player who &quot;spikes&quot; (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent&#x27;s court) or &quot;shoots&quot; to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on &quot;offense&quot;.

The team on &quot;defense&quot; attempts to prevent the attacking team from directing the ball into their court: a player at the net jumps and reaches above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to &quot;block&quot; the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive player positioned behind the blocker attempts to control the ball with a &quot;dig&quot; (usually a forearm pass). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.

The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth, until the ball touches the court or until a fault is committed.

Teams switch ends of the court after every seven points (sets 1 and 2) and five points (set 3) played. There is a technical time-out when the total points of both teams add up to 21. Each team may also request one additional time-out per set.

===Player specializations===
While there are no fixed positions, competitive players generally have specialized defensive and offensive roles.

On defense, players may specialize as either a blocker or a defender:
* Blocker: A blocker is positioned at the net and is responsible for taking away part of the court (e.g. line or angle) with their block. Height, jumping ability, timing and positioning are important factors in blocking.
* Defender: A defender&#x27;s responsibility is to position oneself in the backcourt area not covered by the block, so as to dig the hard-driven spike or chase down the soft shot. Agility, speed and digging skills are important factors in defense.

Some competitive teams have no specializations, with the two players taking turns blocking and playing defense. This style of play is known as split blocking and allows teams to conserve energy since the demand for energy on the sand is higher.

On offense, players tend to specialize in playing on either the right side or left side of the court. This allows for greater consistency in receiving serve and shot selection. Left-handed players generally prefer to play on the right side while right-handed players generally prefer to play on the left side, as it is easier to spike a ball that has not passed across the line of one&#x27;s body. A player who is playing on the opposite side of their handedness is said to be playing on the on-hand side, while a player playing on the same side as their handedness is playing on the off-hand side.

===Characteristics of a hit===

The ball may touch any part of the body (except during the serve, when only the hand or arm may make contact), but must be hit, not caught or thrown. During a hit, a player may only make contact with the ball one time. When two players from the same team contact the ball simultaneously, it is counted as two hits, and either player may make the next contact. When two players from opposing teams contact the ball simultaneously over the net, in what is known as a joust, the team whose side the ball ends up on is entitled to another three contacts.
When receiving a ball overhand with fingers from a hit that is not hard driven, the ball must be contacted &quot;cleanly&quot;. If a player receives the ball open-handed, the contact of each hand with the ball must be exactly simultaneous. In practice, this means that serves are never received open-handed. When receiving an opponent&#x27;s hard-driven attack, a double contact (provided both contacts occur in a single action) and/or a slight lift of the ball is allowed. In particular, in defensive action of a hard driven ball, the ball can be held momentarily overhand with the fingers.

Attack-hits using an &quot;open-handed tip or dink&quot; directing the ball with the fingers are illegal, as are attack-hits using an overhand pass to direct the ball on a trajectory not perpendicular to the line of the shoulders (overhand passes which accidentally cross over the net are an exception). These differences between the rules of indoor volleyball and beach volleyball strongly affect tactics and techniques.

===Block signals===
Beach volleyball players use hand signals to indicate to their partners the type of block they either intend to make (if they are the designated blocker) or that they want their partner to make (if they are the designated defender). Block signals are important so that both the blocker and defender know which area of the court is their responsibility to cover. Block signals are made behind the back to hide them from the opposing team. They are usually given with both hands by the serving player&#x27;s partner prior to the serve, with the left hand referring to the type of block that should be put up against the left-side attacker, and the right hand similarly referring to the right-side attacker. A player may also &quot;wiggle&quot; or &quot;flash&quot; one block signal to indicate which opponent to serve to.

Block signals may also be given during a rally while the opposing team is preparing their attack.

====Common block signals====

* Closed fist: No block should be attempted for the opponent on that side of the court. The blocker should thus &quot;pull-off&quot; the net and play backcourt defense with the defender.
* One finger: The blocker should block an opponent&#x27;s &quot;line&quot; hit, or a ball hit hard towards the nearest sideline. The defender&#x27;s responsibility is to dig all &quot;angle&quot; attacks, as well as run down any &quot;line&quot; shot that goes high over the block.
* Two fingers: The blocker should block an opponent&#x27;s &quot;angle&quot; hit, or a ball hit hard diagonally across the court. The defender&#x27;s responsibility is to dig all &quot;line&quot; attacks, as well as run down any &quot;angle&quot; shot that goes high over the block.
* Three fingers: The blocker pretends to block an opponent&#x27;s &quot;angle&quot; hit, but dives into a &quot;line&quot; block at the last moment. At the same time, the defender pretends to cover the &quot;line&quot; attack, but moves to cover the &quot;angle&quot; attack at the last moment. With this setup, the team on defense is trying to bait the opponent into a hard &quot;line&quot; hit or a cut shot.
* Four fingers: The blocker pretends to block an opponent&#x27;s &quot;line&quot; hit, but dives into an &quot;angle&quot; block at the last moment. At the same time, the defender pretends to cover the &quot;angle&quot; attack, but moves to cover the &quot;line&quot; attack at the last moment. With this setup, the team on defense is trying to bait the opponent into a hard &quot;angle&quot; hit or a high &quot;line&quot; shot.
* Open hand: The blocker should read the attack and block &quot;ball&quot;, deciding how to block based upon the opposing team&#x27;s set, and the hitter&#x27;s approach and arm-swing technique. Similarly, the defender has free rein to read the attack and defend accordingly.
* Shaka: The blocker should spread their arms as wide as possible over the net for a &quot;spread block&quot;, thus blocking all hard hits that travel low over the net. The defender&#x27;s responsibility is to dig any shot that goes over or around the block.

Note: For some teams, closed fist and open hand signals have the opposite meaning of blocking. If the partner is showing the closed fist the blocker should block &quot;ball&quot; and open hand means that the blocker should &quot;pull off&quot; the net.

==Skills==

There are several basic skills competitive players need to master: serving, passing, setting, attacking, blocking, and digging.

===Serve===
Serving is the act of putting the ball into play by striking it with the hand or arm from behind the rear court boundary. It can take the form of an underhand serve or an overhand serve, and examples include: float serve, jump-float serve, top-spin serve, jump serve, sky ball serve and reverse sky ball serve. As beach volleyball is usually played outdoors, the direction and speed of the wind and the position of the sun are considered when choosing which serve to use. Wind can significantly affect the trajectory of a serve and so players can employ different serving strategies to take advantage of the wind conditions. For example, players may choose a top-spin serve when serving into the wind, causing the ball to drop short in front of the passer. Players can also take advantage of the position of the sun. For example, a sky ball serve is especially effective at high noon, because the sun gets into the passer&#x27;s eyes and can cause the passer to become disoriented.

Another factor the server considers is choosing which of the two opposing players to serve the ball to. Because of the three-contact rule, the player who receives the serve will likely also be the attacker, and serving strategies can thus target an opposing player&#x27;s relative weakness in passing, setting or attacking.

Although the serve can be used as an offensive weapon, most rallies are won by the receiving team, as they have the first attack opportunity.

===Pass===

The pass is the first of a team&#x27;s 3 allowed contacts. In indoor volleyball, passing involves two main techniques: forearm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waist line; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a hand set, above the head. However, unlike indoors you may not double contact the first ball using overhand with fingers action on the beach. In practice, this means that bump pass is much more popular in beach volleyball; similarly, beach players rarely use an overhand passing motion as the first (except on a hard driven attack) or last of the three allowed team contacts. Digging is a similar skill to passing, but the term is not used to describe receiving the serve or a free ball, but rather refers to an attempt to prevent an opponent&#x27;s attack hit from touching the court.
===Set===
The set is the second team contact, and its purpose is to position the ball for an attack on the third hit. Similar to a pass, the ball can be set with either a forearm pass technique, known as a bump set, or an overhand pass technique, known as a hand set. Due to the environmental factors that make it harder to hand set a ball &quot;cleanly&quot;, the bump set is more common in the beach game. When hand setting, the player&#x27;s hands must contact the ball simultaneously. If a referee determines that a double-hit has occurred, the point will be given to the other team. Excessive spin after a ball has been set is often used as an indicator of a double contact fault, but causing a ball to spin while setting is not explicitly prohibited. After completing the contact, the setter typically turns their attention to the defense and communicates to their partner whether a blocker is up and which area of the court is open. The second contact can also be used to attack the ball, known as an &quot;over-on-two&quot; attack.

===Attack===

A beach volleyball attack can be categorized as either a spike or a shot. A spike involves hitting the ball hard with one open hand on a downward trajectory from above the top of the net. A shot is a relatively soft attack used to place a ball into an open (undefended) area of the court. Unlike indoor volleyball, a wide variety of shots are utilized in beach volleyball due to the fewer defenders on court. Common shots used in beach volleyball include: roll shots, in which the attacker puts a lot of topspin on the ball so that it has an arcing trajectory that will go over the block then drop quickly; cut shots, in which the shot crosses the net at sharp angles; pokeys, in which the ball is contacted with the attacking player&#x27;s knuckles; and dinks, in which the ball is directed very softly low over the net.

===Block===
A block can be used to: score a direct point by directing an attack back into the opponent&#x27;s court; channel an attack to the defender by &quot;taking away&quot; part of the court; or slow down the ball so the defender has time to chase it down. At the competitive level, blockers will often reach across the net and &quot;penetrate&quot; the opposing team&#x27;s side as much as possible to take away more hitting angles. Blockers may also attempt a shot block, where instead of maximum penetration across the net, the blocker reaches with their hands as high as possible to achieve maximum height above the net.

Players often decide against blocking (if the opposing team&#x27;s pass and set are not in a good position to produce a spike attack) and instead opt to retreat and play defense. This skill is known as peeling, dropping or pulling off the net, and is almost exclusive to beach volleyball.

==Governing bodies==

The primary international governing body for beach volleyball is the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB). The regional governing bodies are:

*Asia and Oceania – Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC)
*Africa – Confédération Africaine de Volleyball (CAV)
*Europe – European Volleyball Confederation (CEV)
*North and Central America – North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation (NORCECA)
*South America – Confederación Sudamericana de Voleibol (CSV)

In the United States, USA Volleyball is the governing body for beach volleyball, as well as indoor and sitting volleyball.

==Levels of competition==
===Professional===
====International====
The FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour is the international professional tour for both men and women organized by the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB). The inaugural tour was held in 1997, replacing the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Series that began in 1989 for men and 1992 for women. World Tour tournaments are ranked from 1 to 5 stars, with 5-star tournaments offering the most prize money. The 2018 World Tour has 47 international tournaments with a total prize purse of over US$7 million. Competing in the World Tour as well as other FIVB-recognized tournaments such as the Summer Olympics allows players to earn FIVB Ranking Points, with higher-star events being worth more points. The World Tour concludes with the World Tour Finals at the end of each season.

The FIVB also organizes the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships every two years, held since 1997. The World Championships have a 48-team main draw and prize purse of US$500,000 per gender.

====Regional====
The five regional governing bodies also organize Continental Tours and Championships:
*Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC) organizes the AVC Beach Volleyball Tour, culminating with the Asian Beach Volleyball Championships (since 2002).
*African Volleyball Confederation (CAVB) organizes the Africa Beach Volleyball Championship.
*European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) organizes the European Beach Volleyball Tour (since 1993), which consists of Satellite and Masters events, culminating with the European Beach Volleyball Championships. From the 2018 season onwards, the Satellite and Masters events have been merged into the FIVB World Tour, but are still organized by the CEV.
*North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation (NORCECA) organizes the NORCECA Beach Volleyball Circuit (since 2007).
*Confederación Sudamericana de Voleibol (CSV) organizes the South American Beach Volleyball Circuit (since 2005).

Players can only participate in the Continental Tour that their national federation is a member of. In addition to prize money, Continental Tour events award players with FIVB ranking points and their national federations with National Federation ranking points. The latter determines how many teams a national federation can send to the World Championships and the Summer Olympics.

====National====

Some countries also have domestic professional tours, but only FIVB-approved national tours can award FIVB ranking points. As of 2017, there are 21 FIVB-approved national tours.

In the United States, the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) is the main domestic professional tour, organizing tournaments annually such as the Manhattan Beach Open. The AVP tour is not FIVB-approved and has had conflicts with the FIVB in the 1980s and 1990s over regulations and sponsorship, leading to an initial boycott of FIVB events by the top American players.

In Germany, the Techniker Beach Tour, previously known as the Smart Beach Tour, is the top domestic tour and is FIVB-approved. It is the organized by the German Volleyball Association and each season ends with the German Beach Volleyball Championships.

In Brazil, the FIVB-approved Brazilian Beach Volleyball Circuit (:pt:Circuito Brasileiro de Voleibol de Praia) is the main national tour. It has been organized by the Brazilian Volleyball Confederation since 1991. The tour consists of the main Open Circuit
and a Challenger Circuit. Each season concludes with the Superpraia championship.
===Multi-sport events===
Men and women&#x27;s beach volleyball has been contested in the Summer Olympics since 1996. It is also contested in other international multi-sport events, including the Commonwealth Games (since 2018), Pan American Games (since 1999), Central American and Caribbean Games (since 1998), Asian Games (since 1998), Pacific Games (since 1999), African Games (since 2011), and Asian Beach Games (since 2008).

===College===
====United States====


In the 2010–2011 academic year, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women&#x27;s beach volleyball, then called &quot;sand volleyball&quot;, as an &quot;emerging sport&quot;. Initially, it was sponsored only for Division II, with Division I added the following academic year. NCAA competition follows standard beach volleyball rules, with competitions involving five doubles-teams from each participating school. For a sport to classify as a championship, at least 40 schools must sponsor it. In 2015, sixty schools had teams, allowing it to become NCAA&#x27;s 90th Championship sport. Beach volleyball became a fully sanctioned NCAA championship sport in the 2015–2016 school year, following votes by leaders of all three NCAA divisions to launch a single all-divisions national championship.

In 2019, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) approved women&#x27;s collegiate beach volleyball as an &quot;emerging sport&quot; with 16 NAIA institutions fielding teams in the 2019–2020 school year.

====Philippines====

Beach volleyball is a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championship sport in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). In the NCAA, it is contested at both the high school and college level.

====Europe====
The European Universities Beach Volleyball Championships are held annually as part of the European Universities Championships.

===Junior===
The FIVB organizes the annual U19 and U21 World Championships. World Championships for the U17 and U23 age-groups were previously held as well. Teams are awarded FIVB ranking points at these Championships, but not prize money. Instead, the winning U19 teams get a direct main draw entry into the next U21 World Championships, while the winning U21 teams get a direct main draw entry into a World Tour 4 or 5-star event of their choice.

Beach volleyball is also contested at the Youth Olympic Games (since 2014).

==Uniform controversy==
In 1999, the FIVB standardized beach volleyball uniforms, with the swimsuit becoming the required uniform for both men and women. Women were required to wear two-piece bikinis, while men were required to wear shorts that were no longer than above the knees. This drew the ire of some athletes.

According to current FIVB rules, female beach volleyball players have the option of playing in shorts or a one-piece swimsuit. Most players, however, prefer the two-piece bikini. Competitors such as Natalie Cook and Holly McPeak have confirmed the FIVB&#x27;s claims that the uniforms are practical for a sport played on sand during the heat of summer, with McPeak saying that the two-piece is more comfortable and allows for a greater range of motion while the one-piece has the further problem of trapping sand. British Olympian Denise Johns claimed that the regulation uniform is intended to be &quot;sexy&quot; and to draw attention. Other players have argued that the bikini is tied to the sport&#x27;s &quot;beach culture&quot;.

During the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, a study was conducted on the camera angles during the beach volleyball games. 20% of the camera angles were focused on the chest area and 17% of the angles were focused on the buttock area. The study concludes that this implies the look of the players is having a greater impact on fans than their actual athleticism.

Some conservative cultures have expressed religious objections to the swimsuit as a uniform. At the 2007 South Pacific Games, rules were adjusted to require less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops. At the 2006 Asian Games, only one Muslim country fielded a team in the women&#x27;s competition, amid concerns the uniform was inappropriate.

In early 2012, the FIVB announced it would allow shorts (maximum length above the knee) and sleeved tops at the London 2012 Olympics. The federation spokesman said that &quot;many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible&quot;. In fact, the weather was so cold for the evening games at London 2012 that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings.

==Lifestyle and culture==

Beach volleyball culture includes the people, language, fashion, and life surrounding the sport of modern beach volleyball. With its origins in Hawaii and California, beach volleyball is strongly associated with a casual, beach-centric lifestyle. As it developed nearly in parallel with modern surfing, beach volleyball culture shares some similarities with surf culture. The beach bum archetype is one such example. Professional beach volleyball matches often have a &quot;party atmosphere&quot;, with loud music, announcers and dancers in between points and during time-outs.

Fashion often extends from the clothing worn during play, like the bikini or boardshorts. And much like surfers, beach volleyball players are at the mercy of the weather; patterns of play often develop based on weather conditions like sun and wind.
===Naturist volleyball===

Naturists were early adopters of the game. Records of regular games in clubs can be found as early as the 1920s. Given the outdoor nature of naturism, a beach version of volleyball was naturally adopted. By the 1960s, a volleyball court could be found in almost all naturist clubs. A large (over 70 teams) nude volleyball tournament has been held each fall since 1971 at White Thorn Lodge in western Pennsylvania, and several smaller tournaments occur each year throughout North America.

==Common injuries==
The most common injuries in beach volleyball are knee, ankle, shoulder and finger injuries. Pain due to overuse of the knee, lower back, and especially shoulder is common as well, but is less prevalent than in indoor volleyball due to the soft landing surface. Acute lost-time injuries are also relatively rare in beach volleyball compared to other team sports. Many players use kinesiology tape. Interest in this tape has surged after American beach volleyball player and three-time Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh wore it at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
==Variants==
===4x4 beach volleyball===
4x4 beach volleyball is a variant of the regular two-man beach game that is popular in the United States and Brazil. FIVB-sanctioned matches are best of 3 sets played to 21 points (15 points in a third set tie-break), with four starting players and up to two substitutes in a team. 4x4 is contested at the World Beach Games.

===Snow volleyball===

Snow volleyball is a winter sport played by two teams on a snow court divided by a net. Originating as a variant of beach volleyball, the rules of snow volleyball are similar to the beach game, with the main differences being the playing surface, the scoring system and the number of players. As in the beach version, matches were originally best of 3 sets played to 21 points, with two players in a team. In December 2018, the FIVB approved new rules for snow volleyball which changed the scoring system to a best of 3 sets played to 15 points, and the number of players to three starters and one substitute in a team. Another difference is that unlike beach volleyball, a touch off block does not count as one of the three allowed touches, and any player may make the subsequent touch after the block.

<doc id="224589" wikidata="Q152218" url="?curid=224589" title="Nine Years' War">
<text>The Nine Years&#x27; War was a European great power conflict from 1688 to 1697 between France and the Grand Alliance. Although largely concentrated in Europe, fighting spread to colonial possessions in the Americas, India, and West Africa. Related conflicts include the Williamite war in Ireland, and King William&#x27;s War in North America.

Louis XIV of France emerged from the Franco-Dutch War in 1678 as the most powerful monarch in Europe. Using a combination of aggression, annexation, and quasi-legal means, he then set about extending his gains to strengthen France&#x27;s frontiers, culminating in the 1683 to 1684 War of the Reunions. The Truce of Ratisbon guaranteed these new borders for twenty years, but concerns among European Protestant states over French expansion and anti-Protestant policies led to the creation of the Grand Alliance, headed by William of Orange.

In September 1688 Louis led an army across the Rhine to seize additional territories beyond it. This move was designed to extend his influence and pressure the Holy Roman Empire into accepting his territorial and dynastic claims. However, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and German princes supported the Dutch in opposing French aims, while the November 1688 Glorious Revolution secured English resources and support for the Alliance. Over the next few years, fighting focused around the Spanish Netherlands, the Rhineland, the Duchy of Savoy, and Catalonia. Although engagements generally favoured Louis&#x27; armies, neither side was able to gain a significant advantage, and by 1696 the main belligerents were financially exhausted, making them keen to negotiate a settlement.

Under the terms of the 1697 Peace of Ryswick, French control over the entirety of Alsace was officially recognized, but Lorraine and gains on the right bank of the Rhine were relinquished and restored to their rulers. Louis XIV also recognised William III as the rightful king of England, while the Dutch acquired barrier fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands to help secure their borders and were granted a favorable commercial treaty. However, both sides viewed the peace as only a pause in hostilities, since it failed to resolve who would succeed the ailing and childless Charles II of Spain as ruler of the Spanish Empire, a question that had dominated European politics for over 30 years. This would lead to the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701.

==Background: 1678–1687==
In the years following the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78), Louis XIV of France, now at the height of his power, sought to impose religious unity in France and to solidify and expand his frontiers. He had already won personal glory by conquering new territory, but he was no longer willing to pursue an open-ended militarist policy of the kind that he had undertaken in 1672. Instead, he would rely upon France&#x27;s clear military superiority to achieve specific strategic objectives along his borders. Proclaimed the &quot;Sun King&quot;, a more mature Louis, conscious that he had failed to achieve decisive results against the Dutch, had turned from conquest to security by using threats, rather than open war, to intimidate his neighbours into submission.

Louis XIV, along with his chief military advisor, Louvois, his foreign minister, Colbert de Croissy, and his technical expert, Vauban, developed France&#x27;s defensive strategy. Vauban had advocated a system of impregnable fortresses along the frontier to keep France&#x27;s enemies out. To construct a proper system, however, the King needed to acquire more land from his neighbours to form a solid forward line. That rationalisation of the frontier would make it far more defensible and define it more clearly in a political sense, but it also created the paradox that while Louis&#x27;s ultimate goals were defensive, he pursued them by offensive means. He grabbed the necessary territory in the Reunions, a strategy that combined legalism, arrogance and aggression.

===Reunions===
The Treaties of Nijmegen (1678) and the earlier Peace of Westphalia (1648) provided Louis XIV with the justification for the Reunions. These treaties had awarded France territorial gains, but owing to the vagaries of their language (as with most treaties of the time) they were notoriously imprecise and self-contradictory, and never specified exact boundary lines. That imprecision often led to differing interpretations of the text and resulted in long disputes over frontier zones, where one side might gain a town or area and its &quot;dependencies&quot;, but it was often unclear what the dependencies were. The machinery needed to determine the territorial ambiguities was already in place through the medium of the parlements at Metz (technically, the only Chamber of Reunion), Besançon and a superior court at Breisach, dealing respectively with Lorraine, Franche-Comté and Alsace. The courts usually found in Louis XIV&#x27;s favour. By 1680, the disputed County of Montbéliard, lying between Franche-Comté and Alsace, had been separated from the Duchy of Württemberg, and by August, Louis XIV had secured the whole of Alsace with the exception of Strasbourg. The Chamber of Reunion of Metz soon laid claims to land around the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun and most of the Spanish Duchy of Luxembourg. The fortress of Luxembourg City itself was then blockaded with the intention of it becoming part of his defensible frontier.

On 30 September 1681, French troops also seized Strasbourg and its outpost, Kehl, on the right bank of the Rhine, a bridge that Holy Roman Empire (&quot;imperial&quot;) troops had regularly exploited during the latter stages of the Dutch War. By forcibly taking the imperial city, the French now controlled two of the three bridgeheads over the Rhine, the others being Breisach, which was already in French hands, and Philippsburg, which Louis XIV had lost by the Treaty of Nijmegen. On the same day that Strasbourg fell, French forces marched into Casale, in northern Italy. The fortress was not taken in the process of the Reunions but had been purchased from the Duke of Mantua, which, together with the French possession of Pinerolo, enabled France to tie down Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy, and to threaten the Spanish Duchy of Milan. All of the Reunion claims and annexations were important strategic points of entry and exit between France and its neighbours and were immediately fortified by Vauban and incorporated into his fortress system.

Thus, the Reunions carved territory from the frontiers of present-day Germany, and the annexations established French power in Italy. However, by seeking to construct his impregnable border, Louis XIV so alarmed the other European states that a general war, which he had sought to avoid, became inevitable. His fortresses covered his frontiers but also projected French power. Only two statesmen might hope to oppose Louis XIV. One was William of Orange, the stadtholder of the United Provinces of the Dutch Republic, the natural leader of Protestant opposition, and the other was Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, the leader of anti-French forces in the Holy Roman Empire and Catholic Europe. Both wanted to act, but effective opposition in 1681–1682 was out of the question since Amsterdam&#x27;s burghers wanted no further conflict with France, and both were fully aware of the current weaknesses of Spain and the empire, whose important German princes from Mainz, Trier, Cologne, Saxony, Bavaria and (significantly) Frederick William I of Brandenburg remained in the pay of France.

===Fighting on two fronts===

Ever since Leopold I&#x27;s intervention in the Franco-Dutch War, Louis XIV considered him his most dangerous enemy, although there was little reason to fear him. Leopold I was weak and was in grave danger along his Hungarian borders, where the Ottoman Turks were threatening to overrun all of Central Europe from the south. Louis had encouraged and assisted the Ottoman drive against Leopold I&#x27;s Habsburg lands and he assured the Porte that he would not support the Emperor. He had also urged John III Sobieski of Poland, unsuccessfully, against siding with Leopold I and pressed the malcontent princes of Transylvania and Hungary to join with the Sultan&#x27;s forces and free their territory from Habsburg rule. When the Ottomans besieged Vienna in the spring of 1683, Louis did nothing to help the defenders.

Taking advantage of the Ottoman threat in the east, Louis invaded the Spanish Netherlands on 1 September 1683 and renewed the siege of Luxembourg, which had been abandoned the previous year. The French required of the Emperor and of Charles II of Spain a recognition of the legality of the recent Reunions, but the Spanish were unwilling to see any more of their holdings fall under Louis&#x27;s jurisdiction. Spain&#x27;s military options were highly limited, but the Ottoman defeat at Vienna on 12 September had emboldened it. In the hope that Leopold I would now make peace in the east and come to his assistance, Charles II declared war on France on 26 October. However, the Emperor had decided to continue the Turkish war in the Balkans and to compromise in the west for the time being. With Leopold I unwilling to fight on two fronts, a strong neutralist party in the Dutch Republic tying William&#x27;s hands and the Elector of Brandenburg stubbornly holding to his alliance with Louis, no possible outcome could occur but complete French victory.

The War of the Reunions was brief and devastating. With the fall of Courtrai in early November, followed by Dixmude in December and Luxembourg in June 1684, Charles II was compelled to accept Louis XIV&#x27;s peace. The Truce of Ratisbon (Regensburg), signed on 15 August by France on one side and by the Emperor and Spain on the other, rewarded the French with Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the gains of the Reunion (Courtrai and Dixmude were returned to Spain). The resolution was not a definitive peace but only a truce for 20 years. However, Louis had sound reasons to feel satisfied since the Emperor and German princes were fully occupied in Hungary, and in the Dutch Republic, William of Orange remained isolated and powerless, largely because of the pro-French mood in Amsterdam.

===Persecution of Huguenots===
At Ratisbon in 1684, France had been in a position to impose its will on Europe; however, after 1685, its dominant military and diplomatic position began to deteriorate. One of the main factors for the diminution was Louis XIV&#x27;s revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which caused the dispersal of France&#x27;s Protestant community. As many as 200,000 Huguenots fled to England, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, and Germany, and spread tales of brutality at the hands of the monarch of Versailles. The direct effect on France of the loss of the community is debatable, but the flight helped destroy the pro-French faction in the Dutch Republic because of its Protestant affiliations, and the exodus of Huguenot merchants and the harassment of Dutch merchants living in France also greatly affected Franco-Dutch trade. The persecution had another effect on Dutch public opinion since the conduct of the Catholic King of France made them look more anxiously at James II, now the Catholic King of England. Many in The Hague believed that James II was closer to his cousin Louis XIV than to his son-in-law and nephew William, which engendered suspicion and, in turn, hostility between Louis and William. Louis&#x27;s seemingly endless territorial claims, coupled with his persecution of Protestants, enabled William of Orange and his party to gain the ascendancy in the Dutch Republic and finally lay the groundwork for his long-sought alliance against France.

Although James II had permitted the Huguenots to settle in England, he had enjoyed an amicable relationship with his fellow Catholic Louis XIV since James realised the importance of the friendship for his own Catholicising measures at home against the suspicions of the Protestant majority. However, the Huguenot presence gave an immense boost to anti-French discourse and joined forces with elements in England that had already been highly suspicious of James. Moreover, conflicts between French and English commercial interests in North America had caused severe friction between both countries since the French had grown antagonistic towards the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the New England colonies, but the English looked upon French pretensions in New France as encroaching upon their own possessions. The rivalry had spread to the other side of the world, where English and French East India Companies had already embarked upon hostilities.

Many in Germany reacted negatively to the persecution of the Huguenots, which disabused the Protestant princes of the idea that Louis XIV was their ally against the intolerant practices of the Catholic Habsburgs. The Elector of Brandenburg answered the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by promulgating the Edict of Potsdam, which invited the fleeing Huguenots to Brandenburg. However, there were motivations other than religious adherence that disabused him and other German princes of his allegiance to France. Louis XIV had pretensions in the Palatinate in the name of his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte, and threatened further annexations of the Rhineland. Thus, Frederick-William, spurning his French subsidies, ended his alliance with France and reached agreements with William of Orange, the Emperor and King Charles XI of Sweden, the last of which by temporarily putting aside their differences over Pomerania.

The flight of the Huguenots in southern France caused outright war in the Alpine districts of Piedmont in the Duchy of Savoy, a northern Italian state that was nominally part of the Empire. From their fort at Pinerolo, the French were able to exert considerable pressure on the Duke of Savoy and to force him to persecute his own Protestant community, the Vaudois (Valdesi). The constant threat of interference and intrusion into his domestic affairs was a source of concern for Victor Amadeus, and in 1687, the Duke&#x27;s policy started to become increasingly anti-French as he searched for a chance to assert his aspirations and concerns. Criticism of Louis XIV&#x27;s regime spread all over Europe. The Truce of Ratisbon, followed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, caused suspicion as to Louis&#x27;s true intentions. Many also feared the King&#x27;s supposed designs on universal monarchy, the uniting of the Spanish and the German crowns with that of France. In response, representatives from the Emperor, the southern German princes, Spain (motivated by the French attack in 1683 and the imposed truce of 1684) and Sweden (in its capacity as princes in the Empire) met in Augsburg to form a defensive league of the Rhine in July 1686. Pope Innocent XI, partly because of his anger at Louis&#x27;s failure to go on crusade against the Turks, gave his secret support.

==Prelude: 1687–88==
The League of Augsburg had little military power – the Empire and its Allies in the form of the Holy League were still busy fighting the Ottoman Turks in Hungary. Many of the petty princes were reluctant to act due to the fear of French retaliation. Nevertheless, Louis XIV watched with apprehension Leopold I&#x27;s advances against the Ottomans. Habsburg victories along the Danube at Buda in September 1686, and Mohács a year later had convinced the French that the Emperor, in alliance with Spain and William of Orange, would soon turn his attention towards France and retake what had recently been won by Louis&#x27;s military intimidation. In response, Louis XIV sought to guarantee his territorial gains of the Reunions by forcing his German neighbours into converting the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent settlement. However, a French ultimatum issued in 1687 failed to gain the desired assurances from the Emperor whose victories in the east made the Germans less anxious to compromise in the west.

Another testing point concerned the pro-French Archbishop-Elector, Maximilian Henry, and the question of his succession in the state of Cologne. The territory of the archbishopric lay along the left bank of the Rhine and included three fortresses of the river-line: Bonn, Rheinberg, and Kaiserswerth, excluding the free-city of Cologne itself. Moreover, the archbishop was also prince-bishop of Liège, the small state astride the strategic highway of the river Meuse. When the Elector died on 3 June, Louis XIV pressed for the pro-French Bishop of Strasbourg, Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, to succeed him. The Emperor, however, favoured Joseph Clement, the brother of Max Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. With neither candidate able to secure the necessary two-thirds of the vote of the canons of the cathedral chapter, the matter was referred to Rome. There was no prospect of the Pope, already in deep conflict with Louis, favouring the French candidate, and on 26 August he awarded the election to Clement.

On 6 September, Leopold I&#x27;s forces under the Elector of Bavaria secured Belgrade for the Empire. With the Ottomans appearing close to collapse, Louis XIV&#x27;s ministers, Louvois and Colbert de Croissy, felt it essential to have a quick resolution along the German frontier before the Emperor turned from the Balkans to lead a comparatively united German Empire against France on the Rhine and reverse the Ratisbon settlement. On 24 September Louis published his manifesto, his &quot;Mémoire de raisons&quot;, listing his grievances: he demanded that the Truce of Ratisbon be turned into a permanent resolution, and that Fürstenburg be appointed Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis&#x27;s control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands &#x27;buffer-zone&#x27; would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies could have known its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to investing Philippsburg, the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns. This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.

Louis XIV and his ministers had hoped for a quick resolution similar to that secured from the War of the Reunions, but by 1688 the situation was drastically different. In the east, an Imperial army, now manned with veteran officers and men, had dispelled the Turkish threat and crushed Imre Thököly&#x27;s revolt in Hungary; while in the west and north, William of Orange was fast becoming the leader of a coalition of Protestant states, anxious to join with the Emperor and Spain, and end the hegemony of France. Louis wanted a short defensive war, yet by crossing the Rhine that summer he began a long war of attrition; a war framed by interests of the state, its defensible frontiers, and the balance of power in Europe.

==Nine years of war: 1688–1697==

===Rhineland and the Empire===
Marshal Duras, Vauban, and 30,000 men – all under the nominal command of the Dauphin – besieged the Elector of Trier&#x27;s fortress of Philippsburg on 27 September 1688. After a vigorous defence it fell on 30 October. Louis XIV&#x27;s army proceeded to take Mannheim, which capitulated on 11 November, shortly followed by Frankenthal. Other towns fell without resistance, including Oppenheim, Worms, Bingen, Kaiserslautern, Heidelberg, Speyer and, above all, the key fortress of Mainz. After Coblenz failed to surrender Boufflers put it under heavy bombardment, but it did not fall to the French.

Louis XIV now mastered the Rhine south of Mainz to the Swiss border, but although the attacks kept the Turks fighting in the east, the impact on Leopold I and the German states had the opposite effect of what had been intended. The League of Augsburg was not strong enough to meet the threat, but on 22 October 1688 the powerful German princes, including the Elector of Brandenburg, John George III, Elector of Saxony, Ernest Augustus of Hanover, and Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, reached an agreement in Magdeburg that mobilised the forces of north Germany. Meanwhile, the Emperor recalled the Bavarian, Swabian, and Franconian troops under the Elector of Bavaria from the Ottoman front to defend south Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland &quot;blitz&quot; would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, Louis XIV and Louvois resolved upon a scorched earth policy in the Palatinate, Baden and Württemberg, intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory. By 20 December, Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and châteaux intended for destruction. On 2 March 1689, Count of Tessé torched Heidelberg; on 8 March Montclar levelled Mannheim. Oppenheim and Worms were finally destroyed on 31 May, followed by Speyer on 1 June, and Bingen on 4 June. In all, French troops burnt over 20 substantial towns as well as numerous villages and remaining medieval castles.

The Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire declared war on France on 11 February 1689, beginning a unified imperial war effort. The Germans prepared to take back what they had lost, and in 1689 formed three armies along the Rhine. The smallest of these, initially under the Elector of Bavaria, protected the upper Rhine between the lines north of Strasbourg to the Black Forest. On the middle Rhine stood the largest army under the best Imperial general, and commander-in-chief, Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Charles V cleared away the French threat on Frankfurt and opened trenches around Mainz on 22/23 July. After a bloody two months siege, the Marquis of Huxelles finally yielded the town on 8 September. Meanwhile, on the lower Rhine stood the Elector of Brandenburg who, aided by the celebrated Dutch engineer Menno van Coehoorn, besieged Kaiserswerth. Kaiserswerth fell on 26 June before the Elector led his army on Bonn, which, having endured a heavy bombardment, finally capitulated on 10 October. The invasion of the Rhineland had united the German princes in their opposition to Louis XIV who had lost more than he had gained that year along the Rhine. The campaign had also created a diversion of French forces and sufficient time for William of Orange to invade England.

===Britain===

James II&#x27;s ill-advised attempts to Catholicise the army, government and other institutions had proved increasingly unpopular with his mainly Protestant subjects. His open Catholicism and his dealings with Catholic France had also strained relations between England and the Dutch Republic, but because his daughter Mary was the Protestant heir to the English throne, her husband William of Orange had been reluctant to act against James II for fear it would ruin her succession prospects. Yet if England was left to itself the situation could become desperate for the Dutch Republic: Louis XIV might intervene and so make James II his vassal; or James, wishing to distract his subjects, might even join with Louis in a repetition of the attack made on the Dutch Republic in 1672. By the end of 1687, therefore, William had envisaged intervention, and by early 1688 he had secretly begun to make active preparations. The birth of a son to James&#x27;s second wife in June displaced William&#x27;s wife Mary as James&#x27;s heir apparent. With the French busy creating their &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; in the Palatinate (too busy to consider serious intervention in the Spanish Netherlands or to move against the south-eastern Dutch provinces along the Rhine) the States General unanimously gave William their full support in the knowledge that the overthrow of James II was in the security interests of their own state.

The invasion fleet consisted of 463  ships and 40,000  men on board, roughly twice the size of the Spanish Armada, with 49  warships, 76 transports carrying soldiers and 120 for the five  thousand horses required by the cavalry and supply train. For propaganda purposes, English admiral Arthur Herbert was nominally put in command, but in reality operational control remained with Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and Vice-Admiral Philips van Almonde. Louis XIV had considered William&#x27;s invasion as a declaration of war between France and the Dutch Republic (officially declared on 26 November); but he did little to stop the invasion – his main concern was the Rhineland. Moreover, French diplomats had calculated that William&#x27;s action would plunge England into a protracted civil war that would either absorb Dutch resources or draw England closer to France. However, after his forces landed unhindered at Torbay on 5 November (O.S), many welcomed William with open arms, and the subsequent Glorious Revolution brought a rapid end to James II&#x27;s reign. On 13 February 1689 (O.S.) William of Orange became King William III of England – reigning jointly with his wife Mary – and bound together the fortunes of England and the Dutch Republic. Yet few people in England suspected that William had sought the crown for himself or that his aim was to bring England into the war against France on the Dutch side. The Convention Parliament did not see that the offer of joint monarchy carried with it the corollary of a declaration of war, but the subsequent actions of the deposed king finally swung Parliament behind William&#x27;s war policy.

British historian J. R. Jones states that King William was given

Before British forces could effectively take part in the war, the English army had to be reorganised. James&#x27; commander-in-chief Louis de Duras, Earl of Feversham, had disbanded the English army in December 1688 so it had to be effectively rebuilt from scratch. Hendrik Trajectinus, Count of Solms and other Dutch officers and officials were appointed by William III in key positions in the English military organisation to reform the English army according to the Dutch model and train the troops in the &#x27;Dutch Exercise&#x27;, a musketry drill more commonly referred to as platoon fire. To make their dominance over the English army less painful for the British, the Dutch agreed that an Englishman would always be in command of a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet.

===Ireland and Scotland===


After his flight from England in December 1688, James II had been given refuge by Louis XIV, who provided him financial and diplomatic assistance. Accompanied by 6,000 French troops, on 12 March 1689 he landed in Ireland, where he was backed by the majority Catholic population. His supporters were known as &quot;Jacobites&quot;, and the war in Ireland was accompanied by a rising in Scotland; for James, the main objective was to retake England and thus he viewed both Scotland and Ireland as strategic dead ends. On the other hand, Louis saw them as an opportunity to divert British resources from the Low Countries, a difference in aims that was never adequately resolved.

James&#x27; Catholic deputy, the Earl of Tyrconnell, had raised an Army of around 36,000, although many were poorly equipped and it was almost impossible to feed, pay and supply so many. Although they quickly occupied much of Ireland, including largely Protestant Ulster, they were unable to capture the key northern port of Derry and were forced to retreat at the end of July. In August, Williamite general Schomberg landed in Belfast Lough with 15,000 reinforcements, but logistics failures meant his army stalled at Dundalk and suffered heavily from sickness and desertion.

The Scottish Jacobites suffered heavy losses in securing victory at Killiecrankie in July 1689, including their leader Viscount Dundee. By May 1690 the rising had been largely suppressed, although pockets of resistance continued in the Highlands until early 1692. At the same time, William III assumed command of government troops in Ireland and gained an important success at The Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, before victory at Beachy Head gave the French temporary control of the English Channel. James returned to France to urge an immediate invasion of England, but the Anglo-Dutch fleet soon regained maritime supremacy, and the opportunity was lost.

By the end of 1690, French and Jacobite troops were confined to the south and west of Ireland. Although repulsed with heavy losses at Limerick in September, William transferred command to Godert de Ginkel and returned to Flanders. Despite receiving reinforcements and a new general in the Marquis de St Ruth, the Franco-Irish army was defeated at Aughrim on 12 July 1691; the war in Ireland ended with the Treaty of Limerick in October, allowing the bulk of the Williamite forces to be shipped to the Low Countries.

===War aims and the Grand Alliance===
The success of William&#x27;s invasion of England rapidly led to the coalition he had long desired. On 12 May 1689 the Dutch and the Holy Roman Emperor had signed an offensive compact in Vienna, the aims of which were no less than to force France back to her borders as they were at the end of the Franco-Spanish War (1659), thus depriving Louis XIV of all his gains since his personal rule began. This meant for the Emperor and the German princes the reconquest of Lorraine, Strasbourg, parts of Alsace, and some Rhineland fortresses. Leopold I had tried to disentangle himself from the Turkish war to concentrate on the coming struggle, but the French invasion of the Rhineland had encouraged the Turks to stiffen their terms for peace and make demands the Emperor could not conceivably accept. Leopold I&#x27;s decision to side with the coalition (against the opposition of many of his advisers) was, therefore, a decision to intervene in the west while continuing to fight the Ottomans in the Balkans. Although the Emperor&#x27;s immediate concerns were for the Rhineland, the most important parts of the treaty were the secret articles pledging England and the States-General to assist him in securing the Spanish succession should Charles II die without an heir, and to use their influence to secure his son&#x27;s election to succeed him as Emperor.

William III regarded the war as an opportunity to reduce the power of France and protect the Dutch Republic, while providing conditions that would encourage trade and commerce. Although there remained territorial anomalies, Dutch war aims did not involve substantial alterations to the frontier; but William did aim to secure his new position in Britain. By seeking refuge in France and subsequently invading Ireland, James II had given William III the ideal instrument to convince the English parliament that entry into a major European war was unavoidable. With the support of Parliament, William III and Mary II declared war on 17 May (O.S.); they then passed the Trade with France Act 1688 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 34), which prohibited all English trade and commerce with France, effective 24 August. This Anglo-Dutch alignment was the basis for the Grand Alliance, ratified on 20 December by William III representing England, Anthonie Heinsius and Treasurer Jacob Hop representing the Dutch Republic, and Königsegg and Stratman representing Emperor Leopold I. Like the Dutch the English were not preoccupied with territorial gains on the Continent, but were deeply concerned with limiting the power of France to defend against a Jacobite restoration (Louis XIV threatened to overthrow the Glorious Revolution and the precarious political settlement by supporting the old king over the new one). William III had secured his goal of mobilising Britain&#x27;s resources for the anti-French coalition, but the Jacobite threat in Scotland and Ireland meant only a small English expeditionary force could be committed to assist the Dutch States Army in the coalition in the Spanish Netherlands for the first three years of the war.

The Duke of Lorraine also joined the Alliance at the same time as England, while the King of Spain (who had been at war with France since April) and the Duke of Savoy signed in June 1690. The Allies had offered Victor Amadeus handsome terms to join the Grand Alliance, including the return of Casale to Mantua (he hoped it would revert to him upon the death of the childless Duke of Mantua) and of Pinerolo to himself. His adhesion to the Allied cause would facilitate the invasion of France through Dauphiné and Provence, where the naval base of Toulon lay. In contrast Louis XIV had embarked on a policy of overt military intimidation to retain Savoy in the French orbit, and had envisaged the military occupation of parts of Piedmont (including the citadel of Turin) to guarantee communications between Pinerolo and Casale. French demands on Victor Amadeus, and their determination to prevent the Duke from achieving his dynastic aims, were nothing less than an attack on Savoyard independence, convincing the Duke that he had to stand up to French aggression.

The Elector of Bavaria consented to add his name to the Grand Alliance on 4 May 1690, while the Elector of Brandenburg joined the anti-French coalition on 6 September. However, few of the minor powers were as devoted to the common cause, and all protected their own interests; some never hesitated to exact a high price for continuing their support. Charles XI of Sweden supplied the contingents due from his German possessions to the Allied cause (6,000 men and 12 warships), while in August Christian V of Denmark agreed to a treaty to supply William III with 7,000 troops in return for a subsidy. However, in March 1691 Sweden and Denmark put aside their mutual distrust and made a treaty of armed neutrality for the protection of their commerce and to prevent the war spreading north. To the annoyance of the Maritime Powers the Swedes now saw their rôle outside the great power-struggle of the Nine Years&#x27; War, exploiting opportunities to increase their own maritime trade. Nevertheless, Louis XIV at last faced a powerful coalition aimed at forcing France to recognise Europe&#x27;s rights and interests.

===Expanding war: 1690–91===
The main fighting of the Nine Years&#x27; War took place around France&#x27;s borders: in the Spanish Netherlands; the Rhineland; Catalonia; and Piedmont-Savoy. The importance of the Spanish Netherlands was the result of its geographic position, sandwiched between France and the Dutch Republic. Initially Marshal Humières commanded French forces in this theatre but in 1689, while the French concentrated on the Rhine, it produced little more than a stand-off – the most significant engagement occurred when William&#x27;s second-in-command, the Prince of Waldeck, defeated Humières at the Battle of Walcourt on 25 August. However, by 1690 the Spanish Netherlands had become the main seat of the war where the French formed two armies: Boufflers&#x27; army on the Moselle, and a larger force to the west under Humières&#x27; successor – and Louis XIV&#x27;s greatest general of the period – Marshal Luxembourg. On 1 July Luxembourg secured a clear tactical victory over Waldeck at the Battle of Fleurus; but his success produced little benefit – Louis XIV&#x27;s concerns for the dauphin on the Rhine (where Marshal de Lorge now held actual command) overrode strategic necessity in the other theatres and forestalled a plan to besiege Namur or Charleroi. For the Emperor and the German princes, though, the most serious fact of 1690 was that the Turks had been victorious on the Danube, requiring them to send reinforcements to the east. The Elector of Bavaria – now Imperial commander-in-chief following Lorraine&#x27;s death in April – could offer nothing on the lower or upper Rhine, and the campaign failed to produce a single major battle or siege.

The smallest front of the war was in Catalonia. In 1689 the Duke of Noailles had led French forces there aimed at bringing further pressure to bear on the Spanish by re-igniting a peasant rising against Charles II, which initially broke out in 1687. Exploiting the situation, Noailles captured Camprodon on 22 May, but a larger Spanish army under the Duke of Villahermosa forced him to withdraw back to Roussillon in August. The Catalan campaign settled down in 1690, but a new front in Piedmont-Savoy proved more eventful. A ferment of religious animosities and Savoyard hatred of the French produced a theatre characterised by massacres and atrocities: constant guerrilla attacks by the armed populace were met by draconian reprisals. In 1690 Saint-Ruth took most of the Victor Amadeus II&#x27;s exposed Duchy of Savoy, routing the Savoyard army in the process until only the great fortress of Montmélian remained in ducal hands; while to the south in Piedmont, Nicolas Catinat led 12,000 men and soundly defeated Victor Amadeus at the Battle of Staffarda on 18 August. Catinat immediately took Saluzzo, followed by Savigliano, Fossano, and Susa, but lacking sufficient troops, and with sickness rife within his army, Catinat was obliged to withdraw back across the Alps for the winter.

French successes in 1690 had checked the Allies on most of the mainland fronts, yet their victories had not broken the Grand Alliance. With the hope of unhinging the coalition French commanders in 1691 prepared for an early double-blow: the capture of Mons in the Spanish Netherlands, and Nice in northern Italy. Boufflers invested Mons on 15 March with some 46,000 men, while Luxembourg commanded a similar force of observation. After some of the most intense fighting of all of Louis XIV&#x27;s wars the town inevitably capitulated on 8 April. Luxembourg proceeded to take Halle at the end of May, while Boufflers bombarded Liège; but these acts proved to have no political nor strategic consequence. The final action of note in the Low Countries came on 19 September when Luxembourg&#x27;s cavalry surprised and defeated the rear of the Allied forces in a minor action near Leuze. Now that the defence of the Spanish Netherlands depended almost wholly on the Allies William III insisted on replacing its Spanish governor, the Marquis of Gastañaga, with the Elector of Bavaria, thus overcoming delays in getting decisions from Madrid.

In 1691 there was little significant fighting in the Catalan and Rhineland fronts. In contrast, the northern Italian theatre was very active. Villefranche fell to French forces on 20 March, followed by Nice on 1 April, forestalling any chance of an Allied invasion of France along the coast. Meanwhile, to the north, in the Duchy of Savoy, the Marquis of La Hoguette took Montmélian (the region&#x27;s last remaining stronghold) on 22 December – a major loss for the Grand Alliance. However, by comparison the French campaign on the Piedmontese plain was far from successful. Although Carmagnola fell in June, the Marquis of Feuquières, on learning of the approach of Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s relief force, precipitously abandoned the Siege of Cuneo with the loss of some 800 men and all his heavy guns. With Louis XIV concentrating his resources in Alsace and the Low Countries, Catinat was forced onto the defensive. The initiative in northern Italy now passed to the Allies who, as early as August, had 45,000 men (on paper) in the region, enabling them to regain Carmagnola in October. Louis XIV offered peace terms in December, but anticipating military superiority for the following campaign Amadeus was not prepared to negotiate seriously.

===Heavy fighting: 1692–93===
After the sudden death of the influential Louvois in July 1691 Louis XIV had assumed a more active role in the direction of military policy, relying on advice from experts such as the Marquis of Chamlay and Vauban. Louvois&#x27; death also brought changes to state policy with the less adventurous Duc de Beauvilliers and the Marquis de Pomponne entering Louis&#x27; government as ministers of state. From 1691 onwards the king and Pomponne pursued efforts to unglue the Grand Alliance, including secret talks with Emperor Leopold I and, from August, attempts of religious solidarity with Catholic Spain. The approaches made to Spain came to naught (the Nine Years&#x27; War was not a religious war), but the Maritime Powers were also keen for peace. Talks were hampered, however, by Louis&#x27; reluctance to cede his earlier gains (at least those made in the Reunions) and, in his deference to the principle of the divine right of kings, his unwillingness to recognise William III&#x27;s claim to the English throne. For his part William was intensely suspicious of the Sun King and his supposed designs for universal monarchy.
Over the winter of 1691/92 the French devised a grand plan to gain the ascendancy over their enemies – a design for the invasion of England in one more effort to support James II in his attempts to regain his kingdoms; and a simultaneous assault on Namur in the Spanish Netherlands. The French hoped that Namur&#x27;s seizure might inspire the Dutch to make peace, but if not, its capture would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations. With 60,000 men (protected by a similar force of observation under Luxembourg), Marshal Vauban invested the stronghold on 29 May. The town soon fell but the citadel – defended by van Coehoorn – held out until 30 June. Endeavouring to restore the situation in the Spanish Netherlands William III surprised Luxembourg&#x27;s army near the village of Steenkirk on 3 August. The Allies enjoyed some initial success, but as French reinforcements came up William III&#x27;s advance stalled. The Allies retired from the field in good order, and both sides claimed victory: the French because they repulsed the assault; the Allies because they had saved Liège from the same fate as Namur. However, due to the nature of late 17th-century warfare the battle, like Fleurus before it, produced little of consequence. (See below).

While French arms had proved successful at Namur the proposed descent on England was a failure. James II believed that there would be considerable support for his cause once he had established himself on English soil, but a series of delays and conflicting orders ensured a very uneven naval contest in the English Channel. The engagement was fought at the tip of the Cherbourg peninsula, and lasted six days. At the action off Cape Barfleur on 29 May, the French fleet of 44 rated vessels under Admiral Tourville put up stern resistance against Admirals Russell&#x27;s, Rooke&#x27;s and Almonde&#x27;s 82 rated English and Dutch vessels. Nevertheless, the French were forced to disengage: some escaped, but the 15 ships that had sought safety in Cherbourg and La Hogue were destroyed by English seamen and fireships on 2–3 June. With the Allies now dominant in the English Channel James II&#x27;s invasion was abandoned. Yet the battle itself was not the death-blow for the French navy: the subsequent mismanagement and underfunding of the fleet under Pontchartrain, coupled with Louis&#x27; own personal lack of interest, were central to France&#x27;s loss of naval superiority over the English and Dutch during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Meanwhile, in southern Europe the Duke of Savoy with 29,000 men (substantially exceeding Catinat&#x27;s number who had sent some troops to the Netherlands) invaded Dauphiné via the mountain trails shown to them by the Vaudois. The Allies invested Embrun, which capitulated on 15 August, before sacking the deserted town of Gap. However, with their commander falling ill with smallpox, and concluding that holding Embrun was untenable, the Allies abandoned Dauphiné in mid-September, leaving behind seventy villages and châteaux burned and pillaged. The attack on Dauphiné had required Noailles give up troops to bolster Catinat, condemning him to a passive campaign in Catalonia; but on the Rhine the French gained the upper hand. De Lorge devoted much of his effort imposing contributions in Swabia and up to Franconia. In October the French commander relieved the siege of Ebernburg on the left bank of the Rhine before returning to winter quarters.
By 1693 the French army had reached an official size of over 400,000 men (on paper), but Louis XIV was facing an economic crisis. France and northern Italy witnessed severe harvest failures resulting in widespread famine which, by the end of 1694, had accounted for the deaths of an estimated two million people. Nevertheless, as a prelude to offering generous peace terms before the Grand Alliance Louis XIV planned to go over to the offensive: Luxembourg would campaign in Flanders, Catinat in northern Italy, and in Germany, where Louis XIV had hoped for a war-winning advantage, Marshal de Lorge would attack Heidelberg. In the event, Heidelberg fell on 22 May before Luxembourg&#x27;s army took to the field in the Netherlands, but the new Imperial commander on the Rhine, Prince Louis of Baden, provided a strong defence and prevented further French gains.

In the Low Countries, the French took Huy and on 23 July, Luxembourg found William&#x27;s army near the villages of Neerwinden and Landen. The ensuing engagement on 29 July was a close and costly encounter but French forces, whose cavalry once again showed their superiority, prevailed. William was however able to quickly replace his losses, while Luxembourg&#x27;s infantry was so battered that he had to refrain from besieging Liège, the city that had been the main objective for the French that year. To still make something of the campaign Louis ordered Luxembourg and Vauban to take Charleroi, the last Spanish stronghold on the sambre, sandwiched between the French fortifications of Mons and Namur. The French captured the town on 10 October which, together with the earlier prizes of Mons, Namur and Huy, provided the French with a new and impressive forward line of defence.

In northern Italy, meanwhile, Catinat marched on Rivoli (with reinforcements from the Rhine and Catalan fronts), forcing the Duke of Savoy to abandon the siege and bombardment of Pinerolo (25 September – 1 October) before withdrawing to protect his rear. The resultant Battle of Marsaglia on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French could get out of their victory was renewed breathing-space to restock what was left of Pinerolo. Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable seaport of Rosas in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege Bellver, both sides entered winter quarters. Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville&#x27;s combined Brest and Toulon squadrons ambushed the Smyrna convoy (a fleet of between 200 and 400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded Cape St. Vincent. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchant ships with a value of some 30 million livres.

===War and diplomacy: 1694–95===
French arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had achieved considerable battlefield success, but with the severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend the same level of energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls. In the background, Louis XIV&#x27;s agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his &#x27;rights&#x27; to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not come apart as long as there was money available and a belief that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.

In the Spanish Netherlands Luxembourg still had 100,000 men; but he was outnumbered. Lacking sufficient supplies to mount an attack, Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies from capturing Dixmude, and on 27 September 1694 the Allies under the Duke of Holstein-Plön recaptured Huy, an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur. Elsewhere, de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October; while in Italy, the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat&#x27;s push into Piedmont. However, in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful. On 27 May Marshal Noailles, supported by French warships, soundly defeated the Marquis of Escalona&#x27;s Spanish forces at the Battle of Torroella on the banks of the river Ter; the French proceeded to take Palamós on 10 June, Gerona on 29 June, and Hostalric, opening the route to Barcelona. With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance, William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for action. Part of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe, Saint-Malo, Le Havre, and Calais. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxería&#x27;s &quot;miquelets&quot;. By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years.

In 1695 French arms suffered two major setbacks: first was the death on 5 January of Louis XIV&#x27;s greatest general of the period, Marshal Luxembourg (to be succeeded by the Duke of Villeroi); the second was the loss of Namur, which was considered to be the strongest fortress in Europe. In a role reversal of 1692 Coehoorn conducted the siege of the stronghold under William III, and the Electors of Bavaria and Brandenburg. The French had attempted diversions with the bombardment of Brussels, but despite Boufflers&#x27; stout defence Namur finally fell on 5 September. The siege had cost the Allies a great deal in men and resources, and had pinned down William III&#x27;s army through the whole summer campaign; but the recapture of Namur, together with the earlier prize of Huy, had restored the Allied position on the Meuse, secured communications between their armies in the Spanish Netherlands and those on the Moselle and Rhine, while greatly damaging Louis&#x27; Reputation.

Meanwhile, the recent fiscal crisis had brought about a transformation in French naval strategy – the Maritime Powers now outstripped France in shipbuilding and arming, and increasingly enjoyed a numerical advantage. Suggesting the abandonment of fleet warfare, &quot;guerre d&#x27;escadre&quot;, in favour of commerce-raiding, &quot;guerre de course,&quot; Vauban advocated the use of the fleet backed by individual shipowners fitting out their own vessels as privateers, aimed at destroying the trade of the Maritime Powers. Vauban argued that this strategic change would deprive the enemy of its economic base without costing Louis XIV money that was far more urgently needed to maintain France&#x27;s armies on land. Privateers cruising either as individuals or in complete squadrons from Dunkirk, St Malo and the smaller ports, achieved significant success. For example, in 1695, the Marquis of Nesmond, with seven ships of the line, captured vessels from the English East India Company that were said to have yielded 10 million livres. In May 1696, Jean Bart slipped the blockade of Dunkirk and struck a Dutch convoy in the North Sea, burning 45 of its ships; on 18 June 1696 he won the battle at Dogger Bank; and in May 1697, the Baron of Pointis with another privateer squadron attacked and seized Cartagena, earning him, and the king, a share of 10 million livres.

For their part, the Allied navy expended more shells on St Malo, Granville, Calais, and Dunkirk; likewise on Palamos in Catalonia where Charles II had appointed the Marquis of Gastañaga as the governor-general. The Allies sent Austrian and German reinforcements under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, a cousin of the Queen of Spain, while the French replaced the ailing Noailles with the Duke of Vendôme who would become one of Louis XIV&#x27;s best generals. But the balance of military power was turning dangerously against the French. In Spain, in the Rhineland, and in the Low Countries, Louis XIV&#x27;s forces only barely held their own: the bombardment of the French channel ports, the threats of invasion, and the loss of Namur were causes of great anxiety for the King at Versailles.

In the meantime the diplomatic breakthrough was made in Italy. For two years the Duke of Savoy&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Gropello, and the Count of Tessé (Catinat&#x27;s second-in-command), had secretly been negotiating a bi-lateral agreement to end the war in Italy. Central to the discussions were the two French fortresses that flanked the Duke&#x27;s territory – Pinerolo and Casale, the latter now completely cut off from French assistance. By now Victor Amadeus had come to fear the growth of Imperial military power and political influence in the region (now more than he feared the French) and the threat it posed to Savoyard independence. Knowing, therefore, that the Imperials were planning to besiege Casale the Duke proposed that the French garrison surrender to him following a token show of force, after which the fortifications would be dismantled and handed back to the Duke of Mantua. Louis XIV was compelled to accept, and after a sham siege and nominal resistance Casale surrendered to Amadeus on 9 July 1695; by mid-September the place had been razed.

===Road to Ryswick: 1696–97===
In the winter of 1695–1696, Louis XIV had come to the conclusion that he had been drawn into an unwinnable war of attrition by the maritime powers. He therefore initiated peace talks with William III. However, William only wanted to make peace after bringing Louis to his knees and therefore planned a large offensive in the Spanish Netherlands, but a monetary crisis in England made this impossible. A French counter-offensive was prevented by the Bombardment of Givet, while a plan for an invasion of England had earlier been discarded after the Jacobite assassination plot on William was discovered. Most other fronts were also relatively quiet throughout 1696: the armies along the Rhine, and in Catalonia, marched and counter-marched but little was achieved. Louis XIV&#x27;s hesitancy to engage with the Allies (despite the confidence of his generals) may have reflected his knowledge of the secret talks that had begun more than a year earlier – with François de Callières acting for Louis XIV, and Jacob Boreel and Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt representing the Dutch. By the spring of 1696 the talks covered the whole panorama of problems that were proving an obstacle to peace. The most difficult of these were the recognition of the Prince of Orange as the King of England and the subsequent status of James II in France; the Dutch demand for a barrier against future French aggression; French tariffs on Dutch commerce; and the territorial settlements in the Rhine–Moselle areas regarding the Reunions and the recent conquests, particularly the strategically important city of Strasbourg. Louis XIV had succeeded in establishing the principle that a new treaty would be fixed within the framework of the Treaties of Westphalia and Nijmegen, and the Truce of Ratisbon, but with the Emperor&#x27;s demands for Strasbourg, and William III&#x27;s insistence that he be recognized as King of England &quot;before&quot; the conclusion of hostilities, it hardly seemed worthwhile in calling for a peace conference.

In Italy the secret negotiations were proving more productive, with the French possession of Pinerolo now central to the talks. When Amadeus threatened to besiege Pinerolo the French, concluding that its defence was not now possible, agreed to hand back the stronghold on condition that its fortifications were demolished. The terms were formalised as the Treaty of Turin on 29 August 1696, by which provision Louis XIV also returned, intact, Montmélian, Nice, Villefranche, Susa, and other small towns. Amongst other concessions Louis XIV also promised not to interfere in Savoy&#x27;s religious policy regarding the Vaudois, provided the Duke prevents any communication between them and French Huguenots. In return, Amadeus agreed to abandon the Grand Alliance and join with Louis XIV – if necessary – to secure the neutralisation of northern Italy. The Emperor, diplomatically outmanoeuvred, was compelled to accept peace in the region by signing the Treaty of Vigevano of 7 October, to which the French immediately acceded. Italy was neutralised and the Nine Years&#x27; War in the peninsula came to an end. Savoy had emerged as an independent sovereign House and a key second-rank power: the Alps, rather than the River Po, would be the boundary of France in the south-east.

The Treaty of Turin started a scramble for peace. With the continual disruption of trade and commerce politicians from England and the Dutch Republic were desirous for an end to the war. France was also facing economic exhaustion, but above all Louis XIV was becoming convinced that Charles II of Spain was near death and he knew that the break-up of the coalition would be essential if France was to benefit from the dynastic battle ahead. The contending parties agreed to meet at Ryswick (Rijswijk) and come to a negotiated settlement. But as talks continued through 1697, so did the fighting, and on 16 April the Allies, under Maximilian of Bavaria, re-took Deinze. The main French goal that year in the Spanish Netherlands was Ath. Vauban and Catinat (now with troops freed from the Italian front) invested the town on 15 May while Marshals Boufflers and Villeroi covered the siege; after an assault on 5 June the Count of Roeux surrendered and the garrison marched out two days later. The Rhineland theatre in 1697 was again quiet: the French commander, Marshal Choiseul (who had replaced the sick de Lorge the previous year), was content to remain behind his fortified lines. Although Baden took Ebernburg on 27 September, news of the peace brought an end to the desultory campaign, and both armies drew back from one another. In Catalonia, however, French forces (now also reinforced with troops from Italy) achieved considerable success when Vendôme, commanding some 32,000 troops, besieged and captured Barcelona. The garrison, under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, capitulated on 10 August. Yet it had been a hard-fought contest: French casualties amounted to about 9,000, and the Spanish had suffered some 12,000 killed, wounded or lost.

==North American theatre (King William&#x27;s War)==
The European war was reflected in North America, where it was known as King William&#x27;s War, though the North American contest was very different in meaning and scale. The European war declaration arrived amid long-running tensions over control of the fur trade, economically vital to both French and English colonies, and influence over the Iroquois, who controlled much of that trade. The French were determined to hold the St. Lawrence country and to extend their power over the vast basin of the Mississippi. Moreover, Hudson Bay was a focal point of dispute between the Protestant English and Catholic French colonists, both of whom claimed a share of its territory and trade. Although important to the colonists, the North American theatre of the Nine Years&#x27; War was of secondary importance to European statesmen. Despite numerical superiority, the English colonists suffered repeated defeats as New France effectively organised its French regulars, local militiamen and Indian allies (notably the Algonquins and Abenakis), to attack frontier settlements. Almost all resources sent to the colonies by England were to defend the English West Indies, the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the empire.

Friction over Indian relations worsened in 1688 with French incursions against the Iroquois in upstate New York, and with Indian raids against smaller settlements in Maine. The Governor General of New France, Louis de Buade de Frontenac, capitalising on disorganisation in New York and New England following the collapse of the Dominion of New England, expanded the war with a series of raids on the northern borders of the English settlements: first was the destruction of Dover, New Hampshire, in July 1689; followed by Pemaquid, Maine, in August. In February 1690 Schenectady in New York was attacked; massacres at Salmon Falls and Casco Bay followed. In response, on 1 May 1690 at the Albany Conference, colonial representatives elected to invade French Canada. In August a land force commanded by Colonel Winthrop set off for Montreal, while a naval force, commanded by the future governor of Massachusetts, Sir William Phips (who earlier on 11 May had seized the capital of French Acadia, Port Royal), set sail for Quebec via the St. Lawrence River. They were repulsed in Battle of Quebec and the expedition on the St Lawrence failed, while the French retook Port Royal.

The war dragged on for several years longer in a series of desultory sallies and frontier raids: neither the leaders in England nor France thought of weakening their position in Europe for the sake of a knock-out blow in North America. By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick, the boundaries and outposts of New France, New England, and New York remained substantially unchanged. In Newfoundland and Hudson&#x27;s Bay French influence now predominated but William III, who had made the interests of the Bay Company a cause of war in North America, was not prepared to hazard his European policy for the sake of their pursuit. The Five Nations, abandoned by their English allies, were obliged to open separate negotiations, and by the treaty of 1701 they agreed to remain neutral in any future Anglo-French conflicts.

==Asia and the Caribbean==

When news of the European war reached Asia, English, French and Dutch colonial governors and merchants quickly took up the struggle. In October 1690 the French Admiral Abraham Duquesne-Guitton sailed into Madras to bombard the Anglo-Dutch fleet; this attack proved foolhardy but extended the war into the Far East. In 1693 the Dutch launched an expedition against their French commercial rivals at Pondichéry on the south-eastern coast of India; the small garrison under François Martin was overwhelmed and surrendered on 6 September.

The Caribbean and the Americas were historically an area of conflict between England and Spain but the two were now allies. Outside North America, French interests were far less significant. Saint Kitts twice changed hands. There was sporadic conflict in Jamaica, Martinique and Hispaniola, but mutual suspicion between the English and Spanish limited joint operations. The Allies had the naval advantage in these isolated areas, though it proved impossible to keep the French from supplying their colonial forces.

By 1693, it was clear the campaigns in Flanders had not dealt a decisive blow to either the Dutch Republic or England, so the French switched to attacking their trade. The Battle of Lagos in 1693 and the loss of the Smyrna convoy caused intense anger among English merchants who demanded increased global protection from the navy. In 1696, a combination of regular French naval forces and privateers went to the Caribbean hoping to intercept the Spanish silver fleet; this was a double threat since capture of the silver would give France a major financial boost and the Spanish ships also carried English cargoes. The strategy failed, but combined with de Pointis&#x27; expedition of 1697, it demonstrated the vulnerability of English interests in the Caribbean and North America; their protection in future conflicts became a matter of urgency. In May 1697 French naval forces raided Cartagena and plundered the city.

== Treaty of Ryswick ==

The peace conference opened in May 1697 in William III&#x27;s palace at Ryswick near The Hague. The Swedes were the official mediators, but it was through the private efforts of Boufflers and William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland that the major issues were resolved. William III had no intention of continuing the war or pressing for Leopold I&#x27;s claims in the Rhineland or for the Spanish succession: it seemed more important for Dutch and British security to obtain Louis XIV&#x27;s recognition of the 1688 revolution.

By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick, Louis XIV kept the whole of Alsace, including Strasbourg. Lorraine returned to its duke (although France retained rights to march troops through the territory), and the French abandoned all gains on the right bank of the Rhine – Philppsburg, Breisach, Freiburg and Kehl. Additionally, the new French fortresses of La Pile, Mont Royal and Fort Louis were to be demolished. To win favour with Madrid over the Spanish succession question, Louis XIV evacuated Catalonia in Spain and Luxembourg, Chimay, Mons, Courtrai, Charleroi and Ath in the Low Countries. The Maritime Powers asked for no territory, but the Dutch were given a favourable commercial treaty, of which the most important provision was to relax regulations to favour Dutch trade and return to the French tariff of 1664. Although Louis XIV continued to shelter James II, he now recognised William III as King of England, and undertook not to actively support the candidature of James II&#x27;s son. He also gave way over the Palatinate and Cologne issues. Beyond this, the French gained recognition of their ownership of the western half of the island of Hispaniola.
The representatives of the Dutch Republic, England, and Spain signed the treaty on 20 September 1697. Emperor Leopold I, desperate for a continuation of the war so as to strengthen his own claims to the Spanish succession, initially resisted the treaty, but because he was still at war with the Turks and could not face fighting France alone, he also sought terms and signed on 30 October. The Emperor&#x27;s finances were in a bad state, and the dissatisfaction aroused by the raising of Hanover to electoral rank had impaired Leopold I&#x27;s influence in Germany. The Protestant princes had also blamed him for the religious clause in the treaty, which stipulated that the lands of the Reunions that France was to surrender would remain Catholic, even those that had been forcibly converteda clear defiance of the Westphalia settlement. However, the Emperor had netted an enormous accretion of power: Leopold I&#x27;s son, Joseph, had been named King of the Romans (1690), and the Emperor&#x27;s candidate for the Polish throne, August of Saxony, had carried the day over Louis XIV&#x27;s candidate, the Prince of Conti. Additionally, Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s decisive victory over the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Zenta – leading to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 – consolidated the Austrian Habsburgs and tipped the European balance of power in favour of the Emperor.

The war had allowed William III to destroy militant Jacobitism and helped bring Scotland and Ireland under more direct control. England emerged as a great economic and naval power and became an important player in European affairs, allowing her to use her wealth and energy in world politics to the fullest advantage. William III also continued to prioritise the security of the Dutch Republic, and in 1698 the Dutch garrisoned a series of fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands as a barrier to French attack – future foreign policy would centre on the maintenance and extension of these barrier fortresses. However, the question of the Spanish inheritance was not discussed at Ryswick, and it remained the most important unsolved question of European politics. Within three years Charles II of Spain would be dead, and Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance would again plunge Europe into conflict – the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Weapons, technology, and the art of war==

===Military developments===
The campaign season typically lasted from May through October. Winter campaigns were rare for lack of animal fodder, but the French practice of storing food and provisions in magazines brought them considerable advantage, often enabling them to take to the field weeks before their foes. Nevertheless, military operations during the Nine Years&#x27; War did not produce decisive results. The war was dominated by what may be called &quot;positional warfare&quot; – the construction, defence, and attack of fortresses and entrenched lines. Positional warfare played a wide variety of roles: fortresses controlled bridgeheads and passes, guarded supply routes, and served as storehouses and magazines. However, fortresses hampered the ability to follow success on the battlefield – defeated armies could flee to friendly fortifications, enabling them to recover and rebuild their numbers from less threatened fronts. Many lesser commanders welcomed these relatively predictable, static operations to mask their lack of military ability. As Daniel Defoe observed in 1697, &quot;Now it is frequent to have armies of 50,000 men of a side spend the whole campaign in dodging – or, as it is genteelly called – observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters.&quot; In fact, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, field armies had waxed to nearly 100,000 men in 1695, the strain of which had reduced the Maritime Powers to a fiscal crisis while the French struggled under the weight of a shattered economy.
Yet there were aggressive commanders: William III, Boufflers, and Luxembourg had the will to win but their methods were hampered by numbers, supply, and communications. The French commanders were also restricted by Louis XIV and Louvois who distrusted field campaigns, preferring Vauban, the taker of fortifications, rather than campaigns of movement.

Another contributing factor for the lack of decisive action was the necessity to fight for secure resources. Armies were expected to support themselves in the field by imposing contributions (taxing local populations) upon a hostile, or even neutral, territory. Subjecting a particular area to contributions was deemed more important than pursuing a defeated army from the battlefield to destroy it. It was primarily financial concerns and availability of resources that shaped campaigns, as armies struggled to outlast the enemy in a long war of attrition. The only decisive action during the whole war came in Ireland where William III crushed the forces of James II in a campaign for legitimacy and control of Britain and Ireland. But, unlike Ireland, Louis XIV&#x27;s continental wars were never fought without compromise: the fighting provided a foundation for diplomatic negotiations and did not dictate a solution.

The major advancement in weapon technology in the 1690s was the introduction of the flintlock musket. The new firing mechanism provided superior rates of fire and accuracy over the cumbersome matchlocks. But the adoption of the flintlock was uneven, and, until 1697, for every three Allied soldiers that were equipped with the new muskets, two soldiers were still handicapped by matchlocks: French second-line troops were issued matchlocks as late as 1703. These weapons were further enhanced with the development of the socket-bayonet. Its predecessor, the plug bayonet – jammed down the firearm&#x27;s barrel – not only prevented the musket from firing but was also a clumsy weapon that took time to fix properly, and even more time to unfix. In contrast, the socket-bayonet could be drawn over the musket&#x27;s muzzle and locked into place by a lug, converting the musket into a short pike yet leaving it capable of fire. The disadvantage of the pike came to be widely recognised: at the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, German battalions armed only with muskets repulsed French cavalry attacks more effectively than units conventionally armed with pikes, while Catinat had abandoned his pikes altogether before undertaking his Alpine campaign against Savoy.

===Naval developments===
In 1688 the most powerful navies were the French, English, and Dutch; the Spanish and Portuguese navies had suffered serious declines in the 17th century. The largest French ships of the period were the &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; and the &quot;Royal Louis&quot;, but while each was rated for 120 guns, they never carried this full complement and were too large for practical purposes: the former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years&#x27; War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the Royal Navy, whose designs stagnated in the 1690s. Innovation in the Royal Navy, however, did not cease. At some stage in the 1690s, for example, English ships began to employ the ship&#x27;s wheel, greatly improving their performance, particularly in heavy weather. (The French navy did not adopt the wheel for another thirty years.)

Combat between naval fleets was decided by cannon duels delivered by ships in line of battle; fireships were also used but were mainly successful against anchored and stationary targets, while the new bomb vessels operated best in bombarding targets on shore. Sea battles rarely proved decisive. Fleets faced the almost impossible task of inflicting enough damage on ships and men to win a clear victory: ultimate success depended not on tactical brilliance but on sheer weight of numbers. Here Louis XIV was at a disadvantage: without as large a maritime commerce as benefited the Allies, the French were unable to supply as many experienced sailors for their navy. Most importantly, though, Louis XIV had to concentrate his resources on the army at the expense of the fleet, enabling the Dutch, and the English in particular, to outdo the French in ship construction. However, naval actions were comparatively uncommon and, just like battles on land, the goal was generally to outlast rather than to destroy one&#x27;s opponent. Louis XIV regarded his navy as an extension of his army – the French fleet&#x27;s most important role was to protect the French coast from enemy invasion. Louis used his fleet to support land and amphibious operations or the bombardment of coastal targets, designed to draw enemy resources from elsewhere and thus aid his land campaigns on the continent.

Once the Allies had secured a clear superiority in numbers the French found it prudent not to contest them in fleet action. At the start of the Nine Years&#x27; War the French fleet had 118 rated vessels and a total of 295 ships of all types. By the end of the war the French had 137 rated ships. In contrast, the English fleet started the war with 173 vessels of all types, and ended it with 323. Between 1694 and 1697 the French built 19 first- to fifth-rated ships; the English built 58 such vessels, and the Dutch constructed 22. Thus the maritime powers outbuilt the French at a rate of four vessels to one.

<text>King William&#x27;s War (also known as the Second Indian War, Father Baudoin&#x27;s War, Castin&#x27;s War, or the First Intercolonial War in French) was the North American theater of the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697), also known as the War of the Grand Alliance or the War of the League of Augsburg. It was the first of six colonial wars (see the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&#x27;s War and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War) fought between New France and New England along with their respective Native allies before France ceded its remaining mainland territories in North America east of the Mississippi River in 1763.

For King William&#x27;s War, neither England nor France thought of weakening their position in Europe to support the war effort in North America. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. According to the terms of the 1697 Peace of Ryswick that ended the Nine Years&#x27; War, the boundaries and outposts of New France, New England, and New York remained substantially unchanged.

The war was largely caused by the fact that the treaties and agreements that were reached at the end of the First Indian War (1675–1678) were not adhered to. In addition, the English were alarmed that the Indians were receiving French or maybe Dutch aid. The Indians preyed on the English and their fears, by making it look as though they were with the French. The French were fooled as well, as they thought the Indians were working with the English. These occurrences, in addition to the fact that the English considered the Indians as their subjects, despite the Indians&#x27; unwillingness to submit, eventually led to two conflicts, one of which was King William&#x27;s War.

==North America at the end of the 17th century==

The English settlers were more than 154,000 at the beginning of the war, outnumbering the French 12 to 1. However, they were divided in multiple colonies along the Atlantic coast, which were unable to cooperate efficiently, and they were engulfed in the Glorious Revolution, creating tension among the colonists. In addition, the English lacked military leadership and had a difficult relationship with their native Iroquois allies.

New France was divided into three entities: Acadia on the Atlantic coast; Canada along the Saint Lawrence River and up to the Great Lakes; and Louisiana from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, along the Mississippi River. The French population amounted to 14,000 in 1689. Although the French were vastly outnumbered, they were more politically unified and contained a disproportionate number of adult males with military backgrounds. Realizing their numerical inferiority, they developed good relationships with the indigenous peoples in order to multiply their forces and made effective use of hit-and-run tactics.

==Causes of the war==

England&#x27;s Catholic King James II was deposed at the end of 1688 in the Glorious Revolution, after which Protestants William III and Mary II took the throne. William joined the League of Augsburg in its war against France (begun earlier in 1688), where James had fled.

In North America, there was significant tension between New France and the northern English colonies, where in 1686 the Stuart monarch had reorganized their separate administrations into the Dominion of New England. New England and the Iroquois Confederacy fought New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy. The Iroquois dominated the economically important Great Lakes fur trade and had been in conflict with New France since 1680. At the urging of New England, the Iroquois interrupted the trade between New France and the western tribes. In retaliation, New France raided Seneca lands of western New York. In turn, New England supported the Iroquois in attacking New France, which they did by raiding Lachine.

There were similar tensions on the border between New England and Acadia, whose boundary New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. English settlers from Massachusetts (whose charter included the Maine area) had expanded their settlements into Acadia. To secure New France&#x27;s claim to present-day Maine, New France established Catholic missions among the three largest Indigenous villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one further north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot) and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec). For their part, in response to King Philip&#x27;s War, the five Indigenous tribes in the region of Acadia created the Wabanaki Confederacy to form a political and military alliance with New France to stop the New England expansion.

==Course of war==
=== New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre ===
The New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre of the war is also known as Castin&#x27;s War and Father Jean Baudoin&#x27;s War.

In April 1688, Governor Andros plundered Castine&#x27;s home and village on Penobscot Bay (Castine, Maine). Later in August, the English raided the French village of Chedabouctou. In response, Castin and the Wabanaki Confederacy engaged in the Northeast Coast Campaign of 1688 along the New England/Acadia border. They began August 13, 1688, at New Dartmouth (Newcastle), killing a few settlers. A few days later they killed two people at Yarmouth in the first battle. At Kennebunk, in the autumn of 1688, members of the Confederacy killed two families.

The following spring, in June 1689, several hundred Abenaki and Pennacook Indians under the command of Kancamagus and Mesandowit raided Dover, New Hampshire, killing more than 20 and taking 29 captives, who were sold into captivity in New France. In June, they killed four men at Saco. In response to these raids, a company of 24 men was raised to search for the bodies and pursue the natives. They were forced to return after they lost a quarter of their men in conflicts with the natives.

In August 1689, Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin and Father Louis-Pierre Thury led an Abenaki war party that captured and destroyed the fort at Pemaquid (in present-day Bristol, Maine). The fall of Pemaquid was a significant setback to the English. It pushed the frontier back to Casco (Falmouth), Maine.

New England retaliated for these raids by sending Major Benjamin Church to raid Acadia. During King William&#x27;s War, Church led four New England raiding parties into Acadia (which included most of Maine) against the Acadians and members of the Wabanaki Confederacy. On the first expedition into Acadia, on September 21, 1689, Church and 250 troops defended a group of English settlers trying to establish themselves at Falmouth (near present-day Portland, Maine). The tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy killed 21 of his men, but Church&#x27;s defense was successful and the natives retreated. Church then returned to Boston, leaving the small group of English settlers unprotected. The following spring over 400 French and native troops, under the leadership of Castin, destroyed Salmon Falls (present-day Berwick, Maine), then returned to Falmouth and massacred all the English settlers in the Battle of Fort Loyal. When Church returned to the village later that summer he buried the dead. The fall of Fort Loyal (Casco) led to the near depopulation of Maine. Native forces were then able to attack New Hampshire frontier without reprisal.

====Battle of Port Royal (1690)====
The New Englanders, led by Sir William Phips, retaliated by attacking Port Royal, the capital of Acadia. The Battle of Port Royal began on May 9, 1690. Phips arrived with 736 New England men in seven English ships. Governor de Meneval fought for two days and then capitulated. The garrison was imprisoned in the church, and Governor de Meneval was confined to his house. The New Englanders levelled what was begun of the new fort. The residents of Port Royal were imprisoned in the church and administered an oath of allegiance to the King.

Phips left, but warships from New York City arrived in June, which resulted in more destruction. The seamen burned and looted the settlement, including the parish church. The New Englanders left again, and Villebon, the governor of Acadia, moved the capital to safer territory inland at Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick). Fort Nashwaak remained the capital until after the war, when Port Royal was restored as the capital in 1699.

In Church&#x27;s second expedition to Acadia, he arrived with 300 men at Casco Bay on 11 September 1690. His mission was to relieve the English Fort Pejpescot (present-day Brunswick, Maine), which had been taken by the Wabanaki Confederacy. He went up the Androscoggin River to Fort Pejepscot. From there he went upriver to Livermore Falls and attacked a native village. Church&#x27;s men shot three or four native men when they were retreating. Church discovered five English captives in the wigwams. Church butchered six or seven natives and took nine prisoners. A few days later, in retaliation, the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy attacked Church at Cape Elizabeth on Purpooduc Point, killing seven of his men and wounding 24 others. On September 26, Church returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

During King William&#x27;s War, when the town of Wells contained about 80 houses and log cabins strung along the Post Road, it was attacked on June 9, 1691, by about 200 Native Americans commanded by the sachem Moxus. But Captain James Converse and his militia successfully defended Lieutenant Joseph Storer&#x27;s garrison, which was surrounded by a gated palisade. Another sachem, Madockawando, threatened to return the next year &quot;and have the dog Converse out of his den&quot;.

As the natives withdrew, they went to York off Cape Neddick and boarded a vessel, killing most of the crew. They also burned a hamlet.

In early 1692, an estimated 150 Abenakis commanded by officers of New France returned to York, killing about 100 of the English settlers and burning down buildings in what would become known as the Candlemas Massacre.

Church&#x27;s third expedition to Acadia during the war was in 1692 when he raided Penobscot (present-day Indian Island, Maine) with 450 men. Church and his men then went on to raid Taconock (Winslow, Maine).

In 1693, New England frigates attacked Port Royal again, burning almost a dozen houses and three barns full of grain.

On July 18, 1694, French soldier Claude-Sébastien de Villieu with about 250 Abenakis from Norridgewock under command of their sagamore (paramount chief) Bomazeen (or Bomoseen) raided the English settlement of Durham, New Hampshire, in the Oyster River Massacre. In all, the French and native force killed 104 inhabitants and took 27 captive, burning half the dwellings, including five garrisons. They also destroyed crops and killed livestock, causing famine and destitution for the survivors.

==== Siege of Pemaquid (1696) ====

In 1696, New France and the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy, led by St. Castine and Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, returned and fought a naval battle in the Bay of Fundy before moving on to raid Pemaquid. After the Siege of Pemaquid, d&#x27;Iberville led a force of 124 Canadians, Acadians, Mi&#x27;kmaq and Abenakis in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They destroyed almost every English settlement in Newfoundland, over 100 English were killed, many times that number captured, and almost 500 deported to England or France.

In retaliation, Church went on his fourth expedition to Acadia and carried out a retaliatory raid against Acadian communities on the Isthmus of Chignecto and Fort Nashwack (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick), which was then the capital of Acadia. He led his troops personally in killing inhabitants of Chignecto, looting their household goods, burning their houses and slaughtering the livestock.

=== Quebec and New York Theatre ===
Also in August 1689, 1,500 Iroquois, seeking revenge for Governor General Denonville&#x27;s actions, attacked the French settlement at Lachine. Count Frontenac, who replaced Denonville as governor general, later attacked the Iroquois village of Onondaga. New France and its Indian allies then attacked English frontier settlements in early 1690, most notably at Schenectady in New York.

This was followed by two expeditions. One, on land under Connecticut provincial militia general Fitz-John Winthrop, targeted Montreal; the other, led by Sir William Phips, targeted Quebec. Winthrop&#x27;s expedition failed due to disease and supply issues, and Phips was defeated in the Battle of Quebec. The Quebec and Port Royal expeditions were the only major New England offensives of King William&#x27;s War; for the remainder of the war the English colonists were primarily engaged in defensive operations, skirmishes and retaliatory raids.

The Iroquois Five Nations suffered from the weakness of their English allies. In 1693 and 1696, the French and their Indian allies ravaged Iroquois towns and destroyed crops while New York colonists remained passive. After the English and French made peace in 1697, the Iroquois, now abandoned by the English colonists, remained at war with New France until 1701, when a peace was agreed at Montreal between New France and a large number of Iroquois and other tribes.

=== Hudson Bay Theatre ===

The war also served as a backdrop for an ongoing economic war between French and English interests in Arctic North America. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had established trading outposts on James Bay and the southern reaches of Hudson Bay by the early 1680s. In a series of raids, beginning with the so-called Hudson Bay expedition, organized by Governor Denonville and continuing through the time of the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697), most of these outposts, including Moose Factory, York Factory and Fort Albany, were taken by French raiders, primarily led by Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville.

But the French forces were small, and their hold on the captured posts quite weak—York Factory was recaptured by the English in 1695. In 1697, in the Battle of Hudson&#x27;s Bay, one of the war&#x27;s major naval battles, d&#x27;Iberville, with a single ship, defeated three English ships and went on to again capture York Factory.

==Aftermath==
The Treaty of Ryswick signed in September 1697 ended the war between the two colonial powers, reverting the colonial borders to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. The peace did not last long; and within five years, the colonies were embroiled in the next phase of the colonial wars, Queen Anne&#x27;s War. After their settlement with France in 1701, the Iroquois remained neutral in that conflict, never taking part in active hostilities against either side. Tensions remained high between the English and the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy, who again fought with the French in Queen Anne&#x27;s War, with conflict characterized by frequent raids in Massachusetts, including one on Groton in 1694, in which children were kidnapped, and the Deerfield Massacre in 1704, in which more than 100 captives were taken north to Montreal for ransom or adoption by Mohawk and French. By the end of the war, natives were successful in killing more than 700 English and capturing over 250 along the Acadia/ New England border.

The Ryswick treaty was unsatisfactory to representatives of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Since most of its trading posts in Hudson Bay had been lost to the French before the war began, the rule of &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; meant that they remained under French control. The company recovered its territories at the negotiating table when the Treaty of Utrecht ended Queen Anne&#x27;s War.

Scholars debate whether the war was a contributing factor to the Salem witch trials. King William&#x27;s War as well as King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–78) led to the displacement of many refugees in Essex County. The refugees carried with them fears of the Indians, which is debated to have led to fears of witchcraft, especially since the devil was arguably closely associated with Indians and magic. Of course, Cotton Mather also wrote that it was going to lead to an age of sorrow and is arguably a proponent in leading Salem into the witchcraft crisis of 1692. Scholars debate this theory and one scholar, Jenny Hale Pulsipher, maintains that King William&#x27;s War was more of a cause. Other scholars that have written on the theory of the wars being a leading cause of the Salem Witchcraft Trials include Mary Beth Norton, James Kences, and Emerson Baker.

<text>The Divine Praises or Laudes Divinae (informally known as Blessed be God) is an 18th-century Roman Catholic expiatory prayer. It is traditionally recited during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. It may also be said after having heard, seen, or inadvertently uttered profanity or blasphemy.
==History==
The Divine Praises were originally written in Italian by Luigi Felici, a Jesuit priest, in 1797 for the purpose of making reparation after saying or hearing sacrilege or blasphemy.

The original text, translated into English and as presented in a 19th century Raccolta, was:

The Divine Praises have been expanded over time; the additional lines, in the order they were added, are presented below.

<doc id="224598" wikidata="Q231141" url="?curid=224598" title="Sarah Kane">
<text>Sarah Kane (3 February 1971 – 20 February 1999) was an English playwright, screenwriter and theatre director. She is known for her plays that deal with themes of redemptive love, sexual desire, pain, torture—both physical and psychological—and death. They are characterised by a poetic intensity, pared-down language, exploration of theatrical form and, in her earlier work, the use of extreme and violent stage action.

Kane herself and scholars of her work, such as Graham Saunders, have identified some of her inspirations as expressionist theatre and Jacobean tragedy. The critic Aleks Sierz saw her work as part of a confrontational style and sensibility of drama termed &quot;in-yer-face theatre&quot;. Sierz originally called Kane &quot;the quintessential in-yer-face writer of the [1990s]&quot; but later remarked in 2009 that although he initially &quot;thought she was very typical of the new writing of the middle 1990s&quot;, &quot;[t]he further we get away from that in time, the more un-typical she seems to be&quot;.

Kane&#x27;s published work consists of five plays, the short film &quot;Skin&quot;, and two newspaper articles for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Brentwood, Essex, and raised by evangelical parents, Kane was a committed Christian in adolescence. Later, however, she rejected those beliefs. After attending Shenfield High School she studied drama at Bristol University, graduating in 1992, and went on to take an MA course in play writing at the University of Birmingham, led by the playwright David Edgar.

She praised Jeremy Weller&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot; as &quot;the one piece of theatre that changed my life&quot;.

Kane wrote consistently throughout her adult life. For a year she was writer-in-residence for Paines Plough, a theatre company promoting new writing, where she actively encouraged other writers. Before that, she had worked briefly as literary associate for the Bush Theatre, London.

==Depression and suicide==
Kane struggled with severe depression for many years and was twice voluntarily admitted to the Maudsley Hospital in London.

She took antidepressants with reluctance. According to Kane&#x27;s agent, Mel Kenyon, Kane told her &quot;she didn&#x27;t like taking pills because they numbed her response to the world, which is, of course, what they&#x27;re supposed to do. But as an artist, it&#x27;s extraordinarily difficult if your responsive level is made less intense. What do you do? Take pills and take away the despair? But despair also engenders knowledge in some way, and that knowledge fuels your understanding of the world and therefore your writing, but at the same time you want to exorcise the despair. She tried to weigh it up all the time.&quot;

Whilst talking about how her play &quot;Phaedra&#x27;s Love&quot; deals with the theme of depression, Kane said that &quot;[t]hrough being very, very low comes an ability to live in the moment because there isn&#x27;t anything else. What do you do if you feel the truth is behind you? Many people feel depression is about emptiness but actually it&#x27;s about being so full that everything cancels itself out. You can&#x27;t have faith without doubt, and what are you left with when you can&#x27;t have love without hate?&quot;

===First suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalisation===
In the early hours of February 17, 1999, Kane attempted suicide in her Brixton flat by consuming 50 sleeping pills and over 150 antidepressant tablets. Her flatmate, David Gibson, awoke and found a suicide note from her, stating that he was not to enter her room. Ignoring this request, Gibson entered Kane&#x27;s room where he found her to be unconscious.

Kane was then taken to London&#x27;s King&#x27;s College Hospital where she was resuscitated and assessed by two psychiatrists. One of the psychiatrists, Nigel Tunstall, said that &quot;it was very clearly the case that [Kane] was intending to kill herself and she was surprised and upset that she had not succeeded&quot; and that she &quot;said she had no intention of killing herself while she remained at King&#x27;s College Hospital, but in abstract terms she said that at some point she would certainly kill herself.&quot; Because of this, Dr Tunstall ordered that Kane should be detained under the Mental Health Act if she attempted to leave the hospital.

Kane was admitted to the Brunel ward of the King&#x27;s College Hospital, which was a general ward and not a psychiatric wing.

While in hospital, she was visited by her agent Mel Kenyon. Kane told Kenyon that her attempted suicide by overdose had been unsuccessful because she had eaten pizza. Kenyon recalled that when she visited Kane &quot;She was extraordinary. She looked happy, healthy. She was very funny. She was brimming with self confidence. I took her 200 cigarettes which we hid under the bed. We talked about everything under the sun. We did talk about suicide. We did talk about God. We did talk about plays. We did talk about friendship.[…] And then after I had given her the fags I just kissed her on her forehead and I said &#x27;I love you&#x27; and she said &#x27;I love you too&#x27; and that was the last time I saw her.&quot;

===Suicide===
Shortly after 3:30 a.m. on 20 February a nurse discovered that Kane was not in her hospital bed. The nurse forced open the door to the Brunel ward&#x27;s toilets where she found Kane&#x27;s dead body. Kane had hung herself by her neck with her own shoelaces from the hook on the inside of the toilet door. She was 28 years old when she died. At the inquest into her death, it was stated that she probably died within three minutes.

===Coroners court inquest===
An inquest was held at Southwark coroner&#x27;s court to determine the circumstances that resulted in Kane&#x27;s death.

The coroner delivered a verdict of death by suicide. The coroner commented that Kane &quot;was plagued with mental anguish and tormented by thoughts of suicide&quot; and that she &quot;made her choice and she made it at a time when she was suffering from a depressive illness [and while] the balance of her mind was disturbed&quot;.

The inquest heard how Kane had not been observed by nurses between 2am and 3:30am on 20 February, which was the timeframe when she left her room in the hospital and went to the toilets where she killed herself. One of the psychiatrists who assessed Kane, Dr Nigel Tunstall, told the inquest how he &quot;took it as read&quot; that Kane would be &quot;constantly observed&quot; by nurses because of the notes from psychiatrist Dr Sedza Mujic who had also assessed Kane. However, nurses were unaware that Kane needed continuous supervision. Dr Tunstall also wrote in his notes that Kane did not require one-to-one care from a psychiatric nurse. It was stated that one of the reasons this was not requested was because it was felt that such a measure could be counter-productive, as Kane was ambivalent towards psychiatric treatment.

A review panel that investigated Kane&#x27;s death recommended that the communication between medical staff be improved by formalising the procedures that related to the risk assessment of patients. However, a spokesperson from the hospital said that none of these procedures would have prevented her death.

After the inquest Sarah Kane&#x27;s father, Peter Kane, considered taking legal action against the hospital for &quot;criminal negligence&quot;. He stated that &quot;The hospital has admitted there was not enough communication between the doctors of these departments and the nurses&quot; and that &quot;I am not seeking financial compensation for the death of my daughter. I want answers as to why she was not given proper care in order that this does not happen to somebody else&#x27;s daughter.&quot;

===Responses to Kane&#x27;s death===

It has been reported that in response to Kane&#x27;s death there was a minute&#x27;s silence held on radio in Germany and that theatres in the country dimmed their lights as a mark of respect.

Kane&#x27;s agent, Mel Kenyon, stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t think she was depressed, It was deeper than that. I think she felt something more like existential despair – which is what makes many artists tick.&quot; Kenyon&#x27;s words were challenged by playwright Anthony Neilson who in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;No one in despair “ticks”&quot; and that &quot;Truth didn&#x27;t kill her, lies did: the lies of worthlessness and futility whispered by an afflicted brain&quot;. Neilson suggested that Kane&#x27;s depression was the result of &quot;crazy and irregular tides of chemicals that crash through the brain&quot; and that &quot;Far from enhancing talent these neurological storms waste time, narrow vision and frequently lead, as here, to that most tragic, most selfish actions&quot;.

Eight days after Kane&#x27;s death &quot;The Independent&quot; published an essay written by Paul Gordon titled &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be suicidal to be an artist, and it doesn&#x27;t help&quot;. In the essay Gordon commented on the negative impact of how &quot;our culture romanticises creativity and depression&quot;. He wrote that &quot;The tragic suicide of the young playwright Sarah Kane is already finding its place in the mythology of the creative depressive: the artist - young or old, but preferably young - who creates public beauty out of personal suffering.&quot; He concluded his piece writing that &quot;Only those who knew Sarah Kane personally can mourn her. Perhaps the rest of us could be less in thrall to the romantic ideas of which her death is prey and think more of the thousands of “nameless” suicides whose deaths each year shames us, as individuals and as a society.&quot;

The playwright Harold Pinter knew Kane personally and remarked how he was not surprised to hear the news of her suicide: &quot;She talked about it a great deal. She just said it was on the cards, you know, and I had to say, &#x27;Come on! For God&#x27;s sake!&#x27; I remember a line in [her play] Crave: &#x27;Death is my lover, and he wants to move in.&#x27; That&#x27;s quite a line, isn&#x27;t it? She felt man&#x27;s inhumanity to man so profoundly. I believe that&#x27;s what finally killed her. She couldn&#x27;t stand the bloody thing any more.&quot; Pinter spoke at Kane&#x27;s memorial and is reported to have just said the following four words: &quot;She was a poet&quot;.

The artistic director of The Bush Theatre, Dominic Dromgoole, had previously known Kane when she was the theatre&#x27;s literary associate. Dromgoole wrote that Kane&#x27;s death &quot;left a long black cloud hanging over many. A huge amount of anger was felt. Anger at her for robbing us of what we so loved. Anger at those who maltreated her. […] anger directed inward for failing to help her.&quot; Dromgoole wrote that he was angry with how Kane had been mistreated by others. He stated that this anger was not aimed at &quot;the press&quot; who he saw as being &quot;held up so easily as scapegoats&quot; but rather it was directed at &quot;certain people in the profession&quot; who he claimed to have taken advantage of her: &quot;There were a lot of timid souls who dared not, who forced Sarah to dare on their behalf. She enacted their fantasies of outrage for them. There is always one child in the class who will do the things others fear to. That is what marks them out, their courage, and their will. The good friends of that child will help her to harness it for her own benefit. The bad friends will use it as a form of entertainment. ‘Go on, jump over that’, ‘Say that to the bully’, ‘Go on cut yourself’. Sarah was that child, and where some reined her back, others let her go, even encouraged her.&quot; He also said that &quot;We all behaved a bit strangely after Sarah&#x27;s death. It awoke old despairs, and morbidities, and adolescent terrors.&quot;

The playwright Edward Bond knew Kane personally and had a correspondence with her. Bond has referred to Kane&#x27;s suicide in various essays he has written about theatre. In an essay from 1999 (revised in 2000) Bond wrote &quot;Sarah Kane had to confront the implacable. You can postpone the confrontation only when you are certain that at some time it will take place. Otherwise it will slip away. Everything Sarah Kane did had authority. If she thought that perhaps the confrontation could not take place in our theatre, because it was losing the understanding and the means – she could not risk waiting. Instead she staged it elsewhere. Her means to confront the implacable are death, a lavatory and shoelaces. They are her comment on the meaningless of our theatre and our lives, and on our own false gods.&quot; 
In 2000 Bond wrote that &quot;Her suicide has to be understood. She was the most gifted dramatist of her generation. It is said that she killed herself because she was clinically depressed. What does that mean of a writer? Not that her death had a cause, but that her life had no inducement. She saw no future for theatre and so none for herself. But it is possible to see such a future for theatre. Her plays present the need for such a theatre.&quot; In 2021 Bond wrote &quot;[Kane] had personal problems but she was destroyed by the theatre industry. Drama had been her umbilical lifeline but the theatre industry tuned it into the rope with which she hanged herself.&quot;

==Works==
Kane originally wanted to be a poet, but decided that she was unable to convey her thoughts and feelings through poetry. She wrote that she was attracted to the stage because &quot;theatre has no memory, which makes it the most existential of the arts. No doubt that is why I keep coming back in the hope that someone in a dark room somewhere will show me an image that burns itself into my mind&quot;.

===&quot;Blasted&quot;===

Kane&#x27;s first play was &quot;Blasted&quot;. Kane wrote the first two scenes while a student in Birmingham, where they were given a public performance. The agent Mel Kenyon was in the audience and subsequently represented Kane, suggesting she should show her work to the Royal Court Theatre in London. The completed play, directed by James Macdonald, opened at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in 1995. The action is set in a room of a luxurious hotel in Leeds where Ian, a racist and foul-mouthed middle-aged journalist, first tries to seduce and later rapes Cate, an innocent, simple-minded young woman. From its opening in a naturalistic—though troubling—world, the play takes on different, nightmarish dimensions when a soldier, armed with a sniper&#x27;s rifle, appears in the room. The narrative ultimately breaks into a series of increasingly disturbing short scenes. Its scenes of anal rape, cannibalism, and other forms of brutality, created one of the biggest theatre scandals in London since Edward Bond&#x27;s &quot;Saved&quot; in 1965. Kane admired Bond&#x27;s work, and he in turn publicly defended Kane&#x27;s play and talent. Other dramatists whom Kane particularly liked and who could be seen as influences include Samuel Beckett, Howard Barker, and Georg Büchner, whose play &quot;Woyzeck&quot; she later directed (Gate Theatre, London 1997).

&quot;Blasted&quot; was fiercely attacked in the British press. &quot;Blasted&quot; was, however, praised by fellow playwrights Martin Crimp, Harold Pinter (who became a friend), Caryl Churchill, who considered it &quot;rather a tender play&quot;. It was later seen to be making parallels between domestic violence and the war in Bosnia, and between emotional and physical violence. Kane said, &quot;The logical conclusion of the attitude that produces an isolated rape in England is the rape camps in Bosnia and the logical conclusion to the way society expects men to behave is war.&quot;
&quot;Blasted&quot; was produced again in 2001 at the Royal Court. The assistant director of this production, Joseph Hill-Gibbins, suggests that &quot;The argument is made through form, through the shifts in styles in &quot;Blasted&quot;. That&#x27;s how she constructs the argument, by taking this setting in an English Northern industrial town and suddenly transporting the action to a war zone.&quot; The critical realism that the first scene sets up is &quot;literally blasted apart&quot; in Scene Two. The critic Ken Urban says that &quot;for Kane, hell is not metaphysical: it is hyperreal, reality magnified&quot;.

===&quot;Skin&quot;===

&quot;Skin&quot; was an eleven-minute film written for Channel 4, a British TV station, depicting a violent relationship between a black woman and a racist skinhead. It was first shown at the London Film Festival in October 1995 and televised by Channel 4 in 1997. The film is directed by Vincent O&#x27;Connell and stars Ewen Bremner, Marcia Rose, Yemi Ajibade and James Bannon.

===&quot;Phaedra&#x27;s Love&quot;===

Kane was then commissioned by the Gate Theatre, London, to write a play inspired by a classic text. &quot;Phaedra&#x27;s Love&quot; was loosely based on the classical dramatist Seneca&#x27;s play &quot;Phaedra&quot;, but given a contemporary setting. In this reworking of the myth of Phaedra&#x27;s doomed love for her stepson Hippolytus, it is Hippolytus, rather than Phaedra, who takes the central role. It is Hippolytus&#x27; emotional cruelty which pushes Phaedra to suicide. Kane reversed classical tradition by showing, rather than describing, violent action on stage. The play contains some of Kane&#x27;s wittiest and most cynical dialogue. Kane described it as &quot;my comedy&quot;. Directed by Kane, it was first performed at the Gate Theatre in 1996.

===&quot;Cleansed&quot;===

&quot;Cleansed&quot; premiered at the Royal Court&#x27;s theatre downstairs in April 1998, and was directed by James Macdonald. This was at the time the most expensive production in the Royal Court&#x27;s history. Kane stated that the play was partly inspired from reading a part of Roland Barthes&#x27;s work &quot;A Lover’s Discourse&quot; where &quot;[Barthes] says the situation of a rejected lover is not unlike the situation of a prisoner in Dachau.&quot; &quot;Cleansed&quot; is set in what Kane in her stage directions described as a &quot;university&quot; but which functions more as a torture chamber or concentration camp, overseen by the sadistic Tinker. It places a young woman and her brother, a disturbed boy, a gay couple and a peepshow dancer within this world of extreme cruelty in which declarations of love are viciously tested. It pushes the limits of what can be realised in the theatre: stage directions include &quot;a sunflower pushes through the floor and grows above their heads&quot; and &quot;the rats carry Carl&#x27;s feet away&quot;. The play was presented at the National Theatre in London in 2016, the first time any of Kane&#x27;s work had been performed there.

===&quot;Crave&quot;===

A change in critical opinion occurred with Kane&#x27;s fourth play, &quot;Crave&quot;, which was directed by Vicky Featherstone and presented by Paines Plough at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in 1998. The play was performed under the pseudonym of Marie Kelvedon, partly because the notion amused Kane, but also so that the play could be viewed without the taint of its author&#x27;s notorious reputation. &quot;Marie&quot; was Kane&#x27;s middle name and she was brought up in the town of Kelvedon Hatch in Essex.

&quot;Crave&quot; marks a break from the on-stage violence of Kane&#x27;s previous works and a move to a freer, sometimes lyrical writing style, at times inspired by her reading of the Bible and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. It has four characters, each identified only by a letter of the alphabet. It dispenses with plot and unlike her earlier work, with its highly specific stage directions, gives no indication what actions, if any, the actors should perform on stage, nor does it give any setting for the play. As such, it may have been influenced by Martin Crimp&#x27;s 1997 play &quot;Attempts on Her Life&quot;, which similarly dispenses with setting and overall narrative. Kane had written of her admiration for Crimp&#x27;s formal innovations. The work is highly intertextual. At the time, Kane regarded it as the &quot;most despairing&quot; of her plays, written when she had lost &quot;faith in love&quot;.

===&quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot;===

Her last play, &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot;, was completed shortly before she died and was performed in 2000, at the Royal Court, directed by James Macdonald. This, Kane&#x27;s shortest and most fragmented theatrical work, dispenses with plot and character, and no indication is given as to how many actors were intended to voice the play. Written at a time when Kane was suffering from severe depression, it has been described by her fellow-playwright and friend David Greig as having as its subject the &quot;psychotic mind&quot;. According to Greig, the title derives from the time—4:48 a.m.—when Kane, in her depressed state, frequently woke in the morning.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1998, Kane was included in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;″s list of &#x27;London&#x27;s Top 100 women&#x27;, which was a list of &quot;The most influential women in the capital&quot;. In the same year she was also featured in the newspaper&#x27;s list of &quot;London&#x27;s fifty brightest young things&quot;.

In 1999 she was one of the recipients of the V Europe Prize Theatrical Realities awarded to the Royal Court Theatre (with Mark Ravenhill, Jez Butterworth, Conor McPherson, Martin McDonagh).

Though Kane&#x27;s work never played to large audiences in the UK and was at first dismissed by many newspaper critics, her plays have been widely performed in Europe, Australia and South America. In 2005, the theatre director Dominic Dromgoole wrote that she was &quot;without doubt the most performed new writer on the international circuit&quot;. Fellow playwright Mark Ravenhill has said her plays &quot;have almost certainly achieved canonical status&quot;. At one point in Germany, there were 17 simultaneous productions of her work. In November 2010, the theatre critic Ben Brantley of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the SoHo Rep&#x27;s &quot;shattering production&quot; of Kane&#x27;s &quot;Blasted&quot; (which had opened two years previously) as &quot;one of the most important New York premieres of the decade&quot;.

In December 2011, the playwright David Eldridge wrote that &quot;For any playwright of my generation the spirit and experiential theatre of Sarah Kane casts a long shadow. Sarah believed passionately that form ought to be expressive and carry meaning as powerfully as the story of a play. &quot;Blasted&quot; markedly influenced my adaptation of the film &quot;Festen&quot; for the stage&quot;.

Playwright Robert Askins, who received a 2015 Tony Award nomination for Best Play for &quot;Hand to God&quot;, has cited Kane as a major inspiration.

In Ukraine, director Roza Sarkisyan chose to produce an excerpt of one of Kane&#x27;s plays for the British Council in 2017, and cites Kane as an inspiration.

<text>Sydney Smith (3 June 1771 – 22 February 1845) was an English wit, writer, and Anglican cleric. Besides his energetic parochial work, he was known for his writing and philosophy, founding the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, lecturing at the Royal Institution and remembered for his rhyming recipe for salad dressing. 

==Early life and education==
Born in Woodford, Essex, England, Smith was the son of merchant Robert Smith (1739–1827) and Maria Olier (1750–1801), who suffered from epilepsy. His father, described as &quot;a man of restless ingenuity and activity ... very clever, odd by nature, but still more odd by design&quot;, &quot;bought, altered, spoiled and sold&quot;, at various times, 19 different estates in England.

Smith himself attributed much of his own lively personality to his French blood, his maternal grandfather having been a French Protestant refugee (a Huguenot) named Olier. He was the second of four brothers and one sister, all remarkable for their talents. Two of the brothers, Robert Percy (known as &quot;Bobus&quot;) and Cecil, were sent to Eton College, but he was sent with the youngest to Winchester College, where he rose to be captain of the school. He and his brother so distinguished themselves that their school-fellows signed a round-robin &quot;refusing to try for the college prizes if the Smiths were allowed to contend for them any more&quot;.

In 1789, Smith became a scholar of New College, Oxford; he received a fellowship after two years&#x27; residence, took his degree in 1792 and obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1796. 

==Career==
Smith planned to read for the bar, but his father disagreed and he was reluctantly compelled to take holy orders. He was ordained at Oxford in 1796 and became curate of the village of Netheravon, near Amesbury on Salisbury Plain. Smith did much for the inhabitants; providing the means for the rudiments of education and thus making better things possible. The squire of the parish, Michael Hicks-Beach, invited the new curate to dine and thrilled to find such a man there engaged him as tutor to his eldest son. It was arranged that they should go to the University of Jena in Germany, but war prevented them and &quot;in stress of politics&quot; said Smith, &quot;we put into Edinburgh&quot; in 1798. While his pupil attended lectures, Smith studied moral philosophy under Dugald Stewart as well as medicine and chemistry. He also preached in the Episcopal chapel, attracting large audiences.

In 1800, Smith published his first book, &quot;Six Sermons, preached in Charlotte Street Chapel, Edinburgh&quot;, and in the same year married, against the wishes of her friends, Catharine Amelia Pybus. They settled at 46 George Street, Edinburgh, where Smith made numerous friends, among them the future Edinburgh Reviewers. Towards the end of his five years&#x27; residence in Edinburgh, in a house in Buccleuch Place, the elevated residence of the then Francis Jeffrey, Smith proposed the setting up of a review. &quot;I was appointed editor&quot;, he says in the preface to the collection of his contributions, &quot;and remained long enough in Edinburgh to edit the first number (October 1802) of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. The motto I proposed for the &quot;Review&quot; was &quot;Tenui musam meditamur avena&quot;.—&#x27;We cultivate literature on a little oatmeal.&#x27; But this was too near the truth to be admitted, and so we took our present grave motto from Publius Syrus, of whom, none of us, I am sure, had ever read a single line.&quot; He continued to write for the &quot;Review&quot; for the next quarter of a century, and his brilliant articles were a main element in its success.

Smith left Edinburgh for good in 1803, and settled in London, where he rapidly became known as a preacher, a lecturer and a society figure. His success as a preacher was such that there was often not standing-room in Berkeley Chapel, Mayfair, where he was morning preacher. He was also &quot;alternate evening preacher&quot; at the Foundling Hospital, and preached at the Berkeley Chapel and the Fitzroy Chapel, now St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Fitzroy Square. He lectured on moral philosophy at the Royal Institution for three seasons, from 1804 to 1806; and treated his subject with such vigour and liveliness that the London world crowded to Albemarle Street to hear him. His views were seen as radical but are now thought of as progressive and far-sighted, being in favour of the education of women, the abolition of slavery and the teaching of practical subjects rather than the classics. His lectures were original and entertaining, but he threw them in the fire when they had served their purpose—providing the money for furnishing his house. His wife rescued the charred manuscripts and published them in 1849 as &quot;Elementary Sketches of Moral Philosophy&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s elder brother Bobus had married Caroline Vernon, aunt of the third Lord Holland, and he was always a welcome visitor at Holland House. His Whig friends came into office for a short time in 1806, and presented Sydney with the living of Foston-le-Clay in Yorkshire. At first he employed a curate; but Spencer Perceval&#x27;s Residence Act was passed in 1808, and after trying in vain to negotiate an exchange, he left London in 1809 and moved his household to Yorkshire. The &quot;Ministry of All the Talents&quot; was driven out of office in 1807 in favour of a &quot;no popery&quot; party, and in that year Smith published the first instalment of his most famous work, &quot;Peter Plymley&#x27;s Letters&quot;, on the subject of Catholic emancipation, ridiculing the opposition of the country clergy. It was published as &quot;A Letter on the Subject of the Catholics to my brother Abraham who lives in the Country&quot;, by Peter Plymley. Nine other letters followed before the end of 1808, when they appeared in collected form. Peter Plymley&#x27;s identity was a secret, but rumours got abroad of the real authorship. Lord Holland wrote to him expressing his own opinion and Grenville&#x27;s, that there had been nothing like it since the days of Swift (&quot;Memoir&quot;, i. 151). The special and temporary nature of the topics advanced in these pamphlets has not prevented them from taking a permanent place in literature, secured for them by their vigorous, picturesque style, generous eloquence, and clearness of exposition.

In his country parish, with no educated neighbour nearby, Smith settled down to his new circumstances, building Foston Rectory, and won the hearts of his parishioners. There had been no resident clergyman for 150 years. He even took on temporarily the Rectory of nearby Londesborough (1823–1829) as &quot;warming-pan&quot; for his neighbour, William George Howard, 8th Earl of Carlisle, then a third son who was training for the Church, with the Rectory of Londesborough in mind. He had a farm of 300 acres (1.2 km2) to keep in order; a dilapidated rectory had to be rebuilt. All these things were attended to beside his contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. &quot;If the chances of life ever enable me to emerge,&quot; he wrote to Lady Holland, &quot;I will show you I have not been wholly occupied by small and sordid pursuits&quot;. He continued to speak in favour of Catholic emancipation, his eloquence being specially directed against those who maintained that a Roman Catholic could not be believed on his oath. &quot;I defy Dr Duignan&quot;, he pleaded, addressing a meeting of clergy in 1823, &quot;in the full vigour of his incapacity, in the strongest access of that Protestant epilepsy with which he was so often convulsed, to have added a single security to the security of that oath&quot;. One of his most vigorous and effective polemics was &quot;A Letter to the Electors upon the Catholic Question&quot; (1826).

After twenty years in Yorkshire, Smith obtained preferment from a Tory minister, Lord Lyndhurst, who presented him with a prebend in Bristol Cathedral in 1828, and enabled him to exchange Foston for the living of Combe Florey, near Taunton, which he held conjointly with the living of Halberton attached to his prebend. From this time he discontinued writing for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. It was expected that when the Whigs came into power Smith would be made a bishop. However, Lord Melbourne, the Whig Prime Minister at the time was against appointing him. There was nothing in his writings to stand in the way. He had been most sedulous as a parochial clergyman. However, his religion was of a practical nature, and his fellow-clergy were suspicious of his limited theology. His scorn for enthusiasts and dread of religious emotion were vented in his bitter attacks on Methodism as well as in ridiculing the followers of Edward Pusey. One of the first things that Charles Grey said on entering Downing Street was, &quot;Now I shall be able to do something for Sydney Smith&quot;; but he was not able to do more than appoint him in 1831 to a residentiary canonry at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in exchange for the prebendal stall he held at Bristol. He was as eager a champion of parliamentary reform as he had been of Catholic emancipation, and one of his best fighting speeches was delivered at Taunton in October 1831, when he made his well-known comparison of the rejection by the House of Lords of the Great Reform Bill with an invented Mrs Partington of Sidmouth, setting out with mop and pattens to stem the Atlantic in a storm. With characteristic philosophy, when he saw that the promotion was doubtful, he made his position certain by resolving not to be a bishop and definitely forbidding his friends to intercede for him.

On the death of his brother Courtenay, Smith inherited £50,000, which put him out of the reach of poverty. His eldest daughter, Saba (1802–1866), married Sir Henry Holland. His eldest son, Douglas, died in 1829 at the outset of what had promised to be a brilliant career. This grief his father never forgot, but nothing could quite destroy the cheerfulness of his later life. His &quot;Three Letters to Archdeacon Singleton on the Ecclesiastical Commission&quot; (1837-38-39) and his &quot;Petition and Letters on the repudiation of debts by the state of Pennsylvania&quot; (1843) are as bright and trenchant as his best contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. He died at his house in Green Street, Mayfair, in London and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Low spirits==
Smith stated that he suffered from &quot;low spirits&quot; and advised others on how best to manage the condition.

==Legacy==

Smith&#x27;s reputation among his contemporaries as a humourist and wit grew to such an extent that a number of the observations which are now attributed to him may be of doubtful provenance. Lord Houghton recorded that he never, except once, knew Smith to make a jest of any religious subject, &quot;and then he immediately withdrew his words, and seemed ashamed that he had uttered them&quot;. To be set against that encomium is one of Smith&#x27;s best-known lines, to the effect that his friend Henry Luttrell&#x27;s idea of heaven was eating &quot;pâté de foie gras&quot; to the sound of trumpets.

No English writer&#x27;s opinions on early American literature had more impact than Smith&#x27;s. He referred to himself as a &quot;sincere friend of America,&quot; but this sentiment is both supported and denied by his many publications. For instance, American writer and critic John Neal dubbed his 1820 question in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, &quot;In the four-quarters of the globe, who reads an American book?&quot; as &quot;insolent&quot; and said he would &quot;furnish a pretty good answer&quot; by traveling to England in 1823, where he became the first American published in any British literary journal.

Long after his death, he was often quoted in English literary life and was remembered by homemakers in the United States through his rhyming recipe for salad dressing which starts:

Jane Austen expert Margaret C. Sullivan speculates in an essay that the character Henry Tilney, the romantic interest of the protagonist Catherine Morland in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; (1803), may have been based on Smith.

The memory and achievements of Smith are perpetuated by the Sydney Smith Association, a registered charity which aims (among other things) to republish online as many of his writings as possible.

<text>Willington is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Greater Willington, in County Durham and the ceremonial county of Durham, England. Willington stands in the foothills of the Pennines and near the River Wear close to Crook, Bishop Auckland and Durham.

Like many communities in the area Willington&#x27;s economy was largely based on coal mining. The closure of the colliery in 1967 therefore affected the local economy.

==Governance==
Willington is in the electoral ward of Willington and Hunwick. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 9,147.

Willington was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Brancepeth, from 1866 Willington was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Crook and Willington, part also went to Bishop Auckland. In 1931 that parish had a population of 6644.

== Leisure facilities&#x27; ==
There are large areas of parkland with play areas in the town.

A leisure centre existed in the village, Spectrum Leisure Centre (a registered charity), but this closed following bankruptcy proceedings in 2024. The centre had a large sports hall, gyms and a bar/refreshment area and hosted events, notably those of Empire Electric Palace Theatre (Crook).

==Education==
Parkside Academy is a coeducational secondary school.

==Football team==
Willington has its own football club, Willington A.F.C., who currently play in the 11th tier of English football. Founded in 1906, the club won the Northern League in 1913–14, 1925–26 and 1929–1930, but have struggled more in recent years, having been relegated to the Wearside League where they continued to struggle.

Willington A.F.C. have reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup twice. In 1939, they lost 3–0 to Bishop Auckland at Roker Park, Sunderland. In 1950 Willington beat Bishop Auckland 4–0 at Wembley

==Notable figures==
George Burdon McKean was born in the village in 1888, moving to Canada in 1902. He returned to England in WW1 as a private soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.
His first gallantry award was as an NCO, in 1917, when he won the Military Medal. A year later, as a commissioned officer, he was involved in a trench raid for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. 
He was also one of a small number of soldiers to be awarded both the Military Medal &amp; the Military Cross – having served as a both a junior rank and an officer.

His Victoria Cross award was celebrated with the unveiling of a memorial stone in the main street of the village, near to the library.

<doc id="224605" wikidata="Q244587" url="?curid=224605" title="Peramelemorphia">
<text>The order Peramelemorphia includes the bandicoots and bilbies. All members of the order are endemic to Australia-New Guinea and most have the characteristic bandicoot shape: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, very large upright ears, relatively long, thin legs, and a thin tail. Their size varies from about 140 grams up to 4 kilograms, but most species are about one kilogram.

==Phylogeny==
===Placement within Marsupialia===
The position of the Peramelemorphia within the marsupial family tree has long been puzzling and controversial. There are two morphological features in the order that appear to show a clear evolutionary link with another marsupial group: the type of foot, and the teeth. Unfortunately, these clear signposts point in opposite directions.

All members of the order are polyprotodont (have several pairs of lower front teeth)—in the case of the Peramelemorphia, three pairs. This suggests that they have evolved within Dasyuromorphia (marsupial carnivores). On the other hand, they also have an unusual feature in their feet: the second and third toes are fused together. This condition is called syndactyly, and is characteristic of the Diprotodontia (the order of marsupial herbivores that includes kangaroos, wombats, possums, and many others).

Attempts to resolve this puzzle include the view that the bandicoot group evolved from the carnivores, retaining the polyprotodont dentition, and independently evolving a syndactyl hind foot; the contrary view that syndactyly is so unusual that it is unlikely to have evolved twice and therefore the bandicoot group must have evolved from a possum-like diprotodont creature, and re-evolved its extra teeth. A third view suggests that the bandicoot group evolved from a primitive carnivore, developed the syndactylous hind foot as a specialisation for climbing, and the diprotodonts then split off and evolved the two-tooth jaw that gives them their name. Recent molecular level investigations do not so far appear to have resolved the puzzle, but do strongly suggest that whatever the relationship of the bandicoot group to the other marsupial orders may be, it is a distant one.

===Relationships within Peramelemorphia===
Recent molecular analyses have resulted in a phylogenetic reconstruction of the members of Peramelemorphia with quite strong support. The most basal split separates Thylacomyidae (&quot;Macrotis&quot;) from all other bandicoots. Probably the next to diverge was the recently extinct Chaeropodidae (&quot;Chaeropus&quot;). The remaining taxa comprise the Peramelidae, which divides into subfamilies Peramelinae (&quot;Isoodon&quot; and &quot;Perameles&quot;) and a clade in which the Echymiperinae (&quot;Echymipera&quot; and &quot;Microperoryctes&quot;) form a sister group to Peroryctinae (&quot;Peroryctes&quot;):

==Fossil record==
Many specimens of modern peramelemorphian (e.g. &quot;Perameles&quot; spp. and &quot;Isoodon&quot; spp.) have been recovered in the fossil record from Pleistocene and Holocene fossil localities. However, very few fossil species have been recovered to date. The first species of fossil peramelemorphian was described by R. A. Stirton in 1955. The specimen Stirton described was a partial lower jaw from the Tirari Desert in Central Australia, Pliocene in age. The lower jaw morphology suggested a relationship with bilbies (Family Thylacomyidae), and was named &quot;Ischnodon australis&quot;.

It was not until 1976 that Archer and Wade described the next fossil bandicoot. A single upper molar was recovered from the Bluff Downs fossil site, Allingham Formation, in northern Queensland, also Pliocene in age. The tooth was similar to that of species of &quot;Perameles&quot;, and was therefore named &quot;Perameles allinghamensis&quot;.

In 1995, the first Miocene species was described from Riversleigh, and was named &quot;Yarala burchfieldi&quot; by Dr Jeannette Muirhead. The species was represented by several upper and lower jaws, which were smaller than any living bandicoots and had a very primitive dentition. A skull was later recovered in 2000, the first for any fossil peramelemorphian to date. Features of the skull and dentition suggested that &quot;Yarala burchfieldi&quot; was distinct from other peramelemorphians, and for this reason, a new Superfamily Yaraloidea and Family Yaralidae were erected to classify this species.

In 1997, Muirhead, Dawson and Archer described a new species of &quot;Perameles&quot;, &quot;Perameles bowensis&quot;, from teeth recovered from two Pliocene fossil localities, Bow and Wellington Caves. The same species was later reported in 2000 from Chinchilla, Queensland, by Mackness and colleagues. In 2002, Price described a new species &quot;Perameles&quot;, &quot;Perameles sobbei&quot;, from the Darling Downs (Pleistocene in age), south-eastern Queensland. This species was represented by a lower jaw and a few isolated lower molars. Additional material were later described in 2005 from the same site, including upper molars.

A second species of &quot;Yarala&quot;, &quot;Yarala kida&quot;, was described in 2006 by Schwartz. This species was recovered from Kangaroo Well, a late Oligocene site from the Northern Territory in Australia. This species is thought to be even more primitive than &quot;Yarala burchfieldi&quot;.

The second fossil skull of any fossil peramelemorphian was also recovered from Miocene sites of Riversleigh. In fact, more than one skull of this new species was found (and several lower and upper jaws), and was significantly different from any other bandicoot to erect a new genus, &quot;Galadi&quot;. The species was named &quot;Galadi speciosus&quot; by Travouillon and colleagues. It was short-snouted unlike modern bandicoots suggesting that it was more carnivorous than its omnivorous modern relatives. Its relationship to other bandicoots is unclear, but it was likely to be less primitive than &quot;Yarala&quot; but more primitive than living bandicoots. An additional three species of &quot;Galadi&quot; were later described in 2013 and named &quot;Galadi grandis&quot;, &quot;Galadi amplus&quot; and &quot;Galadi adversus&quot;.

Gurovich et al. (2013) described a new species of mouse-sized bandicoot from Riversleigh and from Kutjamarpu, Southern Australia. The species, named &quot;Bulungu palara&quot;, is represented by a skull and several lower and upper jaws. Two other species in this genus were also described from the Etadunna Formation in South Australia, &quot;Bulungu muirheadae&quot; which was the oldest fossil bandicoot recovered as of 2013 (about 24 million years old), and &quot;Bulungu campbelli&quot;.

The oldest modern bandicoot (peramelid) and the oldest bilby (Thylacomyid) were later discovered by Travouillon et al., 2014 from Riversleigh World Heritage Area, from middle Miocene fossil deposits (around 15 million years old). The peramelid, &quot;Crash bandicoot&quot;, was named after the famous video game character and is only represented by a single upper jaw. The bilby, &quot;Liyamayi dayi&quot;named after geologist and philanthropist Robert Day, is only known from 3 teeth (2 upper molar, 1 lower molar).

The first record of sexual dimorphism (difference in size between males and females) in a fossil bandicoot was reported from two new species from Riversleigh (Travouillon et al. 2014). Named &quot;Madju variae&quot; and &quot;Madju encorensis&quot;, they are closely related to modern bandicoots, but do not fall in any modern family, as did &quot;Galadi&quot; and &quot;Bulungu&quot;. Instead they are classified as Perameloid, with all known Peremelemorphian, to the exclusion of yaralids. &quot;Madju variae&quot; is also unusual in preserving an ontogenetic series (age series from pouch young to adult), the second of any fossil marsupial mammal in Australia. The study of this ontogenetic series lead researchers to think that &quot;Madju variae&quot; developed slow than modern bandicoots, much more like a bilby, and therefore the rapid development of modern bandicoots must have evolved after the middle Miocene, when Australia started to become more arid.

<text>The Pennines (), also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of uplands mainly located in Northern England. Commonly described as the &quot;backbone of England&quot; because of its length and position, the range runs from Derbyshire and Staffordshire in the north of the Midlands to Northumberland in North East England. From the Tyne Gap in the north, the range extends south through the North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales, South Pennines, and Peak District to end near the valley of the River Trent. The Border Moors and Cheviot Hills, which lie beyond the Tyne Gap, are included in some definitions of the range.

The range is divided into two by the Aire Gap, a wide pass formed by the valleys of the rivers Aire and Ribble. There are several spurs off the main Pennine range east into Greater Manchester and Lancashire, comprising the Rossendale Fells, West Pennine Moors, and Bowland Fells. The Howgill Fells and Orton Fells in Cumbria are also sometimes considered to be Pennine spurs. The Pennines are an important water catchment area, with numerous reservoirs in the head streams of the river valleys.

Most of the range is protected by national parks and national landscapes (formerly Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty). Running north to south, and including the Cheviots, the range is within Northumberland National Park, the North Pennines National Landscape, the Yorkshire Dales National Park, Nidderdale National Landscape, the Forest of Bowland National Landscape, and the Peak District National Park. The only significant unprotected gap is the area between Skipton and Marsden.

Britain&#x27;s oldest long-distance footpath, the 268-mile (429 km) Pennine Way, runs along most of the Pennines.

==Name==
Various etymologies have proposed treating &quot;Pennine&quot; as a native Brittonic/Modern Welsh name related to &quot;&quot; (&quot;head&quot;). It did not become a common name until the 18th century and almost certainly derives from modern comparisons with the Apennine Mountains, which run down the middle of Italy in a similar fashion.

Following an 1853 article by Arthur Hussey, it has become a common belief that the name derives from a passage in &quot;The Description of Britain&quot; (), an infamous historical forgery concocted by Charles Bertram in the 1740s and accepted as genuine until the 1840s. In 2004, George Redmonds reassessed this, finding that numerous respected writers passed over the origin of the mountains&#x27; name in silence even in works dedicated to the topological etymology of Derbyshire and Lancashire. He found that the derivation from Bertram was widely believed and considered uncomfortable. In fact, Redmonds found repeated comparisons with the Italian Apennines going back at least as early as William Camden (1551–1623), many of whose placenames and ideas Bertram incorporated into his work. Bertram was responsible (at most) with popularizing the name against other contenders such as Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;English Andes&quot;. His own form of the name was the &quot;Pennine Alps&quot; (&quot;&quot;), which today is used for a western section of the continental Alps. Those mountains (the area around the St. Bernard Pass) derive their name from the Latin &quot;Alpes Pœninæ&quot; whose name has been variously derived from the Carthaginians, a local god, and Celtic &quot;peninus&quot;. The St. Bernard Pass was the pass used in the invasions of Italy by the Gallic Boii and Lingones in 390 BC. The etymology of the Apennines themselves—whose name first referred to their northern extremity and then later spread southward—is also disputed but is usually taken to derive from some form of Celtic &quot;pen&quot; or &quot;ben&quot; (&quot;mountain, head&quot;).

Various towns and geographical features within the Pennines have names of Celtic origin, including Pennington, Penrith, Pen-y-ghent, Pendle Hill, the River Eden, and Cumbria. More commonly, local names result from Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlements. In Yorkshire, Teesdale, and Cumbria, many words of Norse origin, not commonly used in standard English, are part of everyday speech: for example, &quot;gill/ghyll&quot; (narrow steep valley), &quot;beck&quot; (brook or stream), &quot;fell&quot; (hill), and &quot;dale&quot; (valley). Northumbrian/borders terms are used in South Tynedale, Weardale, and Allendale, such as &quot;burn&quot; (stream), &quot;cleugh&quot; (ravine), &quot;hope&quot; (valley), &quot;law&quot; (hill) and &quot;linn&quot; (waterfall).

==Geography==
The northern Pennine range is bordered by the foothills of the Lake District, and uplands of the Howgill Fells, Orton Fells, Border Moors and Cheviot Hills. The West Pennine Moors, Rossendale Valley and Forest of Bowland are western spurs, the former two are in the South Pennines. The Howgill Fells and Orton Fells are sometimes considered to be part of the Pennines, both inside the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The Pennines are fringed by extensive lowlands including the Eden Valley, West Lancashire Coastal Plain, Cheshire Plain, Vale of York, Humberhead Levels and the Midland Plains.

The main range of the Pennines start from its southern end at the Weaver Hills in the Peak District. The southern foothills of the range merge into the valley and basin of the River Trent, separating the range from the Midland Plains to the south. The Pennines continue northwards across the Peak District and adjoin the South Pennines approximately around the Tame Valley, Standedge and Holme Valley. The South Pennines are separated from the Forest of Bowland by the Ribble Valley, and include the Rossendale Valley and West Pennine Moors in the west. The range continues further north into the Aire Gap which separates the Yorkshire Dales from the South Pennines to the south and the Forest of Bowland to the southwest. The main range then continues northwards across the Yorkshire Dales to the Stainmore Gap where it adjoins the North Pennines. The range continues into its northern end at the Tyne Gap, separating it from the Border Moors and Cheviot Hills across the Anglo-Scottish border.

Although the Pennines cover the area between the Peak District and the Tyne Gap, the Pennine Way affects perceptions of the southern and northern extents of the defined area. The southern end of the Pennines is said to be in the High Peak of Derbyshire at Edale, the start of the Pennine Way, but the main range continues south across the Peak District to the Weaver Hills, with its foothills merging into the Trent Valley. This encompasses eastern Cheshire, northern and eastern Staffordshire, and southern Derbyshire. Conversely, the Border Moors and Cheviot Hills, separated by the Tyne Gap and Whin Sill to the south, along which run the A69 and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and River Tweed to the north, are not part of the Pennines but, perhaps because the Pennine Way crosses them, they are treated as such.

Most of the Pennine landscape is characterised by upland areas of high moorland indented by more fertile river valleys, although the landscape varies in different areas. The Peak District consists of hills, plateaus and valleys, divided into the Dark Peak with moorlands and gritstone edges, and the White Peak with limestone gorges. The South Pennines is an area of hills and moorlands with narrow valleys between the Peak District and Yorkshire Dales. Bowland is dominated by a central upland landform of deeply incised gritstone fells covered with tracts of heather-covered peat moorland, blanket bog and steep-sided wooded valleys linking the upland and lowland landscapes. The landscape is higher and more mountainous in the Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines. The Yorkshire Dales are characterised by valleys, moorlands and fells while the North Pennines consist of plateaus, moorlands, fells, edges and valleys, with most of the higher peaks in the west.

===Elevation===
Rising less than , the Pennines are fells, with most of the mountainous terrain in the north. The highest point is Cross Fell in eastern Cumbria, at and other principal peaks in the North Pennines are Great Dun Fell , Mickle Fell , and Burnhope Seat . Principal peaks in the Yorkshire Dales include Whernside , Ingleborough , High Seat , Wild Boar Fell and Pen-y-ghent . Principal peaks in the Forest of Bowland include Ward&#x27;s Stone , Fair Snape Fell , and Hawthornthwaite Fell . Terrain is lower towards the south and the only peaks which exceed are Kinder Scout and Bleaklow in the Peak District. Other principal peaks in the South Pennines and Peak District include Black Hill , Shining Tor , Pendle Hill , Black Chew Head , Rombalds Moor and Winter Hill .

===Drainage===
For much of their length the Pennines are the main watershed in northern England, dividing east and west. The rivers Eden, Ribble, Dane and tributaries of the Mersey (including the Irwell, Tame and Goyt) flow westwards towards the Irish Sea.

On the eastern side of the Pennines, the rivers Tyne, Wear, and Tees all drain directly to the North Sea. The Swale, Ure, Nidd, Wharfe, Aire, Calder and Don all flow into the Yorkshire Ouse, and reach the sea through the Humber Estuary.

The River Trent flows around the southern end of the Pennines and northwards on the eastern side taking water from tributaries, principally the Dove and Derwent. The Trent drains the east and west sides of the southern Pennines, also reaching the North Sea through the Humber Estuary. The Trent and Ouse meet and enter the Humber at Trent Falls. Maximum discharge through the Humber can reach 1,500 m3/s (53,000 cu ft/s).

===Climate===
According to the Köppen classification, the Pennines generally have a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) like the rest of England, but the uplands have more precipitation, stronger winds and colder weather than the surrounding areas. Some of the higher elevations have a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), which may border a tundra (&quot;ET&quot;) and subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) in areas like Great Dun Fell.

More snow falls on the Pennines than on surrounding lowland areas due to the elevation and distance from the coast; unlike lowland areas of England, the Pennines can have quite severe winters.

The northwest is amongst the wettest regions of England and much of the rain falls on the Pennines. The eastern side is drier than the west—the rain shadow shields northeast England from rainfall that would otherwise fall there.

Precipitation is important for the area&#x27;s biodiversity and human population. Many towns and cities are located along rivers flowing from the range and in northwest England the lack of natural aquifers is compensated for by reservoirs.

Water has carved out limestone landscapes in the North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales and Peak District, with gorges and caves present in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District. In some areas, precipitation has contributed to poor soils, resulting in part in moorland landscapes that characterize much of the range. In other areas where the soil has not been degraded, it has resulted in lush vegetation.

For the purpose of growing plants, the Pennines are in hardiness zones 7 and 8, as defined by the USDA. Zone 8 is common throughout most of the UK, and zone 7 is the UK&#x27;s coldest hardiness zone. The Pennines, Scottish Highlands, Southern Uplands and Snowdonia are the only areas of the UK in zone 7.
==Geology==

The Pennines have been carved from a series of geological structures whose overall form is a broad anticline whose axis extends in a north–south direction. The North Pennines are coincident with the Alston Block and the Yorkshire Dales are coincident with the Askrigg Block. In the south the Peak District is essentially a flat-topped dome.

Each of the structures consists of Carboniferous limestone overlain with Millstone Grit. The limestone is exposed at the surface in the North Pennines, Yorkshire Dales and the Peak District. In the Dales and the White Peak, limestone exposure has caused the formation of large cave systems and watercourses. In the Dales the caves or potholes are known as &quot;pots&quot; in the Yorkshire dialect. They include some of the largest caves in England at Gaping Gill, more than deep and Rowten Pot, deep. Titan in the Peak District, the deepest shaft known in Britain, is connected to Peak Cavern in Castleton, Derbyshire, the largest cave entrance in the country. Erosion of the limestone has led to geological formations, such as the limestone pavements at Malham Cove.

Between the northern and southern areas of exposed limestone between Skipton and the Dark Peak is a belt of exposed gritstone. Here the shales and sandstones of the Millstone Grit form high hills occupied by moorland covered with bracken, peat, heather and coarse grasses; the higher ground is uncultivable and barely fit for pasture.

==History==

The Pennines contained Bronze Age settlements, and evidence remains of Neolithic settlement including many stone circles and henges, such as Long Meg and Her Daughters.

The uplands were controlled by the tribal federation of the Brigantes, made up of small tribes who inhabited the area and cooperated on defence and external affairs. They evolved an early form of kingdom. During Roman times, the Brigantes were dominated by the Romans who exploited the Pennines for their natural resources including the wild animals found there.

The Pennines were an obstacle for Anglo-Saxon expansion westwards, although it appears the Anglo-Saxons travelled through the valleys. During the Dark Ages the Pennines were controlled by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is believed that the north Pennines were under the control of the kingdom of Rheged.

During Norse times the Pennines were settled by Viking Danes in the east and Norwegian Vikings in the west. The Vikings influenced place names, culture and genetics. When England was unified the Pennines were incorporated. The mix of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Viking heritage resembled much of the rest of northern England and its culture developed alongside its lowland neighbours in northwest and northeast England. The Pennines were not a distinct political polity, but were divided between neighbouring counties in northeast and northwest England; a major part was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

==Demography==
The Pennine region is sparsely populated by English standards. Larger population centres are in the foothills and lowlands fringing the southern Pennine range, such as Barnsley, Chesterfield, Halifax, Huddersfield, Macclesfield, Oldham, Bury, Rochdale, Middleton, and Stockport but most of the northern Pennine range is thinly populated. The cities of Bradford, Derby, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent and Wakefield are also in the surrounding foothills and lowlands. The Pennines contain the highest village in the United Kingdom, Flash, at , near the southern end of the range in Staffordshire.

==Economy==

The main economic activities in the Pennines include sheep farming, quarrying, finance and tourism. In the Peak District, tourism is the major local employment for park residents (24%), with manufacturing industries (19%) and quarrying (12%) also being important while 12% are employed in agriculture. Limestone is the most important mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement, while other extracted materials include shale for cement and gritstone for building stone. The springs at Buxton and Ashbourne are exploited to produce bottled mineral water and there are approximately 2,700 farms in the National Park. The South Pennines are predominantly industrial, with the main industries including textiles, quarrying and mining, while other economic activities within the South Pennines include tourism and farming.

Although the Forest of Bowland is mostly rural, the main economic activities in the area include farming and tourism. In the Yorkshire Dales, tourism accounts for £350 million of expenditure every year while employment is mostly dominated by farming, accommodation and food sectors. There are also significant challenges for managing tourism, farming and other developments within the National Park. The main economic activities in the North Pennines include tourism, farming, timber and small-scale quarrying, due to the rural landscape.

==Transport==

Gaps that allow west–east communication across the Pennines include the Tyne Gap between the Pennines and the Cheviots, through which the A69 road and Tyne Valley railway link Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne. The A66 road, its summit at , follows the course of a Roman road from Scotch Corner to Penrith through the Stainmore Gap between the Eden Valley in Cumbria and Teesdale in County Durham. The Aire Gap links Lancashire and Yorkshire via the valleys of the Aire and Ribble. Other high-level roads include Buttertubs Pass, named from limestone potholes near its summit, between Hawes in Wensleydale and Swaledale and the A684 road from Sedbergh to Hawes via Garsdale Head which reaches .

Further south the A58 road traverses the Calder Valley between West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester reaching between Littleborough and Ripponden, while the A646 road along the Calder Valley between Burnley and Halifax reaches following valley floors. In the Peak District the A628 Woodhead road links the M67 motorway in Greater Manchester with the M1 motorway in South Yorkshire and Holme Moss is crossed by the A6024 road, whose highest point is near Holme Moss transmitting station between Longdendale and Holmfirth.

The Pennines are traversed by the M62 motorway, the highest motorway in England at on Windy Hill near Junction 23.

Three trans-Pennine canals built during the Industrial Revolution cross the range:
* The Huddersfield Narrow Canal connects Huddersfield in the east with Manchester in the west. When it reaches Marsden, it passes under the range through the Standedge Tunnel to Diggle. Fortnightly during the summer season, one can pass through the tunnel on a public narrowboat.
* The Rochdale Canal crosses the Pennines via Rochdale, connecting the market town of Sowerby Bridge with Manchester.
* The Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the longest and most northerly, crosses the Pennines via Skipton, Burnley, Chorley and Wigan connecting Leeds in the east with Liverpool in the west.

The first of three Woodhead Tunnels was completed by the Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845, engineered by Charles Vignoles and Joseph Locke. At the time of its completion in 1845, Woodhead 1 was one of the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnels at a length of 3 miles 13 yards (4,840 m); it was the first of several trans-Pennine tunnels including the Standedge and Totley tunnels, which are only slightly longer. The first two tunnels were replaced by Woodhead 3, which was longer at 3 miles 66 yards (4860m). It was bored for the overhead electrification of the route and completed in 1953. The tunnel was opened by the transport minister Alan Lennox-Boyd on 3 June 1954. It was designed by Sir William Halcrow &amp; Partners. The line was closed in 1981.

The London and North Western Railway acquired the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1847 and built a single-line tunnel parallel to the canal tunnel at Standedge with a length of 3 miles, 57 yards (4803 m). Today rail services along the Huddersfield line between Huddersfield and Victoria and Piccadilly stations in Manchester are operated by TransPennine Express and Northern. Between 1869 and 1876 the Midland Railway built the Settle-Carlisle Line through remote, scenic regions of the Pennines from near Settle to Carlisle passing Appleby-in-Westmorland and other settlements, some a distance from their stations. The line has survived, despite difficult times
and is operated by Northern Rail.

The Trans Pennine Trail, a long-distance route for cyclists, horse riders and walkers, runs west–east alongside rivers and canals, along disused railway tracks and through historic towns and cities from Southport to Hornsea (). It crosses the north–south Pennine Way () at Crowden-in-Longdendale.

==National Parks and AONBs==

Considerable areas of the Pennines are protected as UK national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs). Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty are afforded much the same protection as national parks. The national parks within the Pennines are the Peak District National Park and the Yorkshire Dales National Park with the Northumberland National Park sometimes also included.

The North Pennines AONB just north of the Yorkshire Dales rivals the national park in size and includes some of the Pennines&#x27; highest peaks and its most isolated and sparsely populated areas. Other AONBs are Nidderdale east of the Yorkshire Dales, and the Bowland Fells, including Pendle Hill, west of the Yorkshire Dales.

==Language==
The language used in pre-Roman and Roman times was Common Brittonic. During the Early Middle Ages, the Cumbric language developed. Little evidence of Cumbric remains, so it is difficult to ascertain whether or not it was distinct from Old Welsh. The extent of the region in which Cumbric was spoken is also unknown.

During Anglo-Saxon times the area was settled by Anglian peoples of Mercia and Northumbria, rather than the Saxon people of Southern England. Celtic speech remained in most areas of the Pennines longer than it did in the surrounding areas of England. Eventually, the Celtic tongue of the Pennines was replaced by early English as Anglo-Saxons and Vikings settled the area and assimilated the Celts.

During the Viking Age Scandinavian settlers brought their language, Old Norse. The fusion of Norse influences into Old English was important in the formation of Middle English and hence Modern English, and many individual words of Norse descent remain in use in local dialects, such as that of Yorkshire, and in local place names.

==Folklore and customs==
The folklore and customs are mostly based on Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Viking customs and folklore. Many customs and stories have their origin in Christianised pagan traditions. In the Peak District, a notable custom is well dressing, which has its origin in pagan traditions that became Christianised.

==Flora==
Flora in the higher Pennines is adapted to moorland and subarctic landscapes and climates. The flora found there can be found in other areas of moorland in Northern Europe and some species are also found in areas of tundra. In the Pennine millstone grit areas above an altitude of the topsoil is so acidic, pH 2 to 4, that it can grow only bracken, heather, sphagnum, and coarse grasses such as cottongrass, purple moor grass and heath rush. As the Ice age glacial sheets retreated c. 11,500 BC trees returned and archaeological palynology can identify their species. The first trees to settle were willow, birch and juniper, followed later by alder and pine. By 6500 BC temperatures were warmer and woodlands covered 90% of the dales with mostly pine, elm, lime and oak. On the limestone soils the oak was slower to colonize and pine and birch predominated. Around 3000 BC a noticeable decline in tree pollen indicates that neolithic farmers were clearing woodland to increase grazing for domestic livestock, and studies at Linton Mires and Eshton Tarn find an increase in grassland species. On poorly drained impermeable areas of millstone grit, shale or clays the topsoil gets waterlogged in winter and spring. Here tree suppression combined with the heavier rainfall results in blanket bog up to thick. The erosion of peat still exposes stumps of ancient trees.
Limestone areas of the Pennines in the White Peak, Yorkshire Dales and Upper Teesdale have been designated as nature reserves or Important Plant Areas by the botanical conservation charity Plantlife, and are nationally important for their wildflowers.

==Fauna==
Fauna in the Pennines is similar to the rest of England and Wales, but the area hosts some specialised species. Deer are found throughout the Pennines and some species of animals that are rare elsewhere in England can be found here. Arctic hares, which were common in Britain during the Ice Age and retreated to the cooler, more tundra-like uplands once the climate warmed up, were introduced to the Dark Peak area of the Peak District in the 19th century.

Large areas of heather moorland in the Pennines are managed for driven shooting of wild red grouse. The related and declining black grouse is still found in northern parts of the Pennines. Other birds whose English breeding strongholds are in the Pennines include golden plover, snipe, curlew, dunlin, merlin, short-eared owl, ring ouzel and twite, though many of these are at the southern limit of their distributions and are more common in Scotland.

<text>The PGA Championship (often referred to as the US PGA Championship or USPGA outside the United States) is an annual golf tournament conducted by the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America. The PGA is one of the four men&#x27;s major golf championships, the others being The Open, the Masters and the U.S. Open.

It was formerly played in mid-August on the third weekend before Labor Day weekend, serving as the fourth and final men&#x27;s major of the golf season. Beginning in 2019, the tournament is played in May on the weekend before Memorial Day, as the season&#x27;s second major following the Masters Tournament in April. It is an official money event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and Japan Golf Tour, with a purse of $11 million for the 100th edition in 2018.

In line with the other majors, winning the PGA gains privileges that improve career security. PGA champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, and The Open Championship) and The Players Championship for the next five years, and are eligible for the PGA Championship for life. They receive membership on the PGA Tour and the European Tour for the following five seasons. The PGA Championship is the only one of the four majors that is exclusively for professional players.

The PGA Championship has been held at various venues. Some of the early sites are now quite obscure, but in recent years, the event has generally been played at a small group of celebrated courses.

==History==

In 1894, with 41 golf courses operating in the United States, two unofficial national championships for amateur golfers were organized. One was held at Newport Country Club in Rhode Island, and the other at Saint Andrew&#x27;s Golf Club in New York. In addition, and at the same time as the amateur event, Saint Andrew&#x27;s conducted an Open championship for professional golfers. None of the championships was officially sanctioned by a governing body for American golf, causing considerable controversy among players and organizers. Later in 1894 this led to the formation of the United States Golf Association (USGA), which became the first formal golf organization in the country. After the formation of the USGA, golf quickly became a sport of national popularity and importance.

In February 1916 the Professional Golfers Association of America (PGA) was established in New York City. One month earlier, the wealthy department store owner Rodman Wanamaker hosted a luncheon with the leading golf professionals of the day at the Wykagyl Country Club in nearby New Rochelle. The attendees prepared the agenda for the formal organization of the PGA; consequently, golf historians have dubbed Wykagyl &quot;The Cradle of the PGA.&quot; The new organization&#x27;s first president was Robert White, one of Wykagyl&#x27;s best-known golf professionals.

The first PGA Championship was held in October 1916 at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York. The winner, Jim Barnes, received $500 and a diamond-studded gold medal donated by Rodman Wanamaker. The 2016 winner, Jimmy Walker, earned $1.8 million. The champion is also awarded a replica of the Wanamaker Trophy, which was also donated by Wanamaker, to keep for one year, and a smaller-sized keeper replica Wanamaker Trophy.

===Format===
The PGA Championship was originally a match play event in the early fall, but it varied from May to December. After World War II, the championship was usually in late May or late June, then moved to early July in 1953 and a few weeks later in 1954, with the finals played on Tuesday. As a match play event (with a stroke play qualifier), it was not uncommon for the finalists to play over 200 holes in seven days. The 1957 event lost money, and at the PGA meetings in November it was changed to stroke play, starting in 1958, with the standard 72-hole format of 18 holes per day for four days, Thursday to Sunday. Network television broadcasters, preferring a large group of well-known contenders on the final day, pressured the PGA of America to make the format change.

During the 1960s, the PGA Championship was played the week after The Open Championship five times, making it virtually impossible for players to compete in both majors. In 1965, the PGA was contested for the first time in August, and returned in 1969, save for a one-year move to late February in 1971, played in Florida. The 2016 event was moved to late July, two weeks after the Open Championship, to accommodate the 2016 Summer Olympics in August.

Before the 2017 edition, it was announced that the PGA Championship would be moved to May on the weekend before Memorial Day, beginning in 2019. The PGA Tour concurrently announced that it would move its Players Championship back to March the same year; it had been moved from March to May in 2007. The PGA of America cited the addition of golf to the Summer Olympics, as well as cooler weather enabling a wider array of options for host courses, as reasoning for the change. It was also believed that the PGA Tour wished to re-align its season so that the FedEx Cup Playoffs would not have to compete with the start of football season in late-August.

===Location===
The PGA Championship has normally been played in the eastern half of the United States except eleven times, most recently in 2020 at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco. It was the first for the Bay Area, returning to California after a quarter century. Prior to 2020, it was last played in the Pacific time zone in 1998, at Sahalee east of Seattle. (The Mountain time zone has hosted three editions, all in suburban Denver, in 1941, 1967, and 1985.) The 103rd PGA Championship was held at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort&#x27;s Ocean Course in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, and the 104th was held at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The state of New York has hosted the championship thirteen times, followed by Ohio (11) and Pennsylvania (9).

===Promotion===
The tournament was previously promoted with the slogan &quot;Glory&#x27;s Last Shot&quot;. In 2013, the tagline was dropped in favor of &quot;The Season&#x27;s Final Major&quot;, as suggested by PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem while discussing the allowance of a one-week break in its schedule before the Ryder Cup. Finchem had argued that the slogan was not appropriate as it weakened the stature of events that occur after it, such as the PGA Tour&#x27;s FedEx Cup playoffs. PGA of America CEO Pete Bevacqua explained that they had also had discussions with CBS, adding that &quot;it was three entities that all quickly came to the same conclusion that, you know what, there&#x27;s just not much in that tag line and we don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing much for the PGA Championship, so let&#x27;s not stick with it. Let&#x27;s think what else is out there.&quot; For a time, the tournament used the slogan &quot;This is Major&quot; as a replacement.

==Trophy==
The Wanamaker Trophy, named after businessman and golfer Rodman Wanamaker, stands nearly tall and weighs . The trophy was lost, briefly, for a few years until it showed up in 1930 in the cellar of L.A. Young and Company. Ironically, this cellar was in the factory which made the clubs for the man responsible for losing it, Walter Hagen. Hagen claimed to have trusted a taxi driver with the precious cargo, but it never returned to his hotel. There is a smaller replica trophy that the champion gets to keep permanently, but the original must be returned for the following years tournament.

==Qualification==
The PGA Championship was established for the purpose of providing a high-profile tournament specifically for professional golfers at a time when they were generally not held in high esteem in a sport that was largely run by wealthy amateurs. This origin is still reflected in the entry system for the Championship. It is the only major that does not explicitly invite leading amateurs to compete (it is possible for amateurs to get into the field, although the only viable ways are by winning one of the other major championships, or winning a PGA Tour event while playing on a sponsor&#x27;s exemption), and the only one that reserves so many places, 20 of 156, for club professionals. These slots are determined by the top finishers in the PGA Professional Championship, which is held in late April.

Since December 1968, the PGA Tour has been independent of the PGA of America.

The PGA Tour is an elite organization of tournament professionals, but the PGA Championship is still run by the PGA of America, which is mainly a body for club and teaching professionals. The PGA Championship is the only major that does not explicitly grant entry to the top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking, although special exemptions are commonly given to players in the top 100 (not just top 50) of the ranking who are not already qualified.

, the qualification criteria are as follows:
*Former PGA Champions.
*Winners of the last five U.S. Opens.
*Winners of the last five Masters.
*Winners of the last five Open Championships.
*Winners of the last three The Players Championships.
*Top 3 on the Official World Golf Ranking International Federation Ranking List (criterion added in 2023).
*The current Senior PGA Champion.
*The low 15 scorers and ties in the previous PGA Championship.
*The 20 low scorers in the last PGA Professional Championship.
*The 70 leaders in PGA Championship points list (based on official money earned on the PGA Tour since the previous PGA Championship).
*Members of the most recent United States and European Ryder Cup Teams who are ranked the top 100 of the Official World Golf Ranking as of one week before the start of the tournament.
*Any tournament winner co-sponsored or approved by the PGA Tour since the previous PGA Championship .
*The PGA of America reserves the right to invite additional players not included in the categories listed above.
*The total field is a maximum of 156 players. Vacancies are filled by the first available player from the list of alternates (those below 70th place in official money standings).

<text>mod_perl is an optional module for the Apache HTTP server. It embeds a Perl interpreter into the Apache server. In addition to allowing Apache modules to be written in the Perl programming language, it allows the Apache web server to be dynamically configured by Perl programs. However, its most common use is so that dynamic content produced by Perl scripts can be served in response to incoming requests, without the significant overhead of re-launching the Perl interpreter for each request.

Slash, which runs the web site Slashdot, is written using mod_perl. Early versions of PHP were implemented in Perl using mod_perl.

mod_perl can emulate a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) environment, so that existing Perl CGI scripts can benefit from the performance boost without having to be re-written.

Unlike CGI (and most other web application environments), mod_perl provides complete access to the Apache API, allowing programmers to write handlers for all phases in the Apache request cycle, manipulate Apache&#x27;s internal tables and state mechanisms, share data between Apache processes or threads, alter or extend the Apache configuration file parser, and add Perl code to the configuration file itself, among other things.
