<text>Mercury-Atlas 7, launched May 24, 1962, was the fourth crewed flight of Project Mercury. The spacecraft, named Aurora 7, was piloted by astronaut Scott Carpenter. He was the sixth human to fly in space. The mission used Mercury spacecraft No. 18 and Atlas launch vehicle No. 107-D.

The flight was for three Earth orbits, essentially a repeat of John Glenn&#x27;s Mercury-Atlas 6. However, a targeting error during reentry took the spacecraft off-course, delaying recovery of Carpenter and the spacecraft for an hour. Carpenter was held responsible, at least in part, for the landing error. Carpenter left NASA for the Navy SEALAB program in 1964.

==Pilot==
The original pilot selected for Mercury Atlas-7 was to have been Deke Slayton, with Schirra as his back-up. However Slayton was removed from flight status after the discovery of cardiac dysrhythmia during a training run in the &quot;g&quot;-loading centrifuge. Slayton had chosen the name &quot;Delta 7&quot; for the spacecraft, as this would have been the fourth crewed flight and Delta (Δ) is the fourth letter in the Greek alphabet. Instead of using Schirra who was backup, it was decided to give the mission to Carpenter, who was the backup crew for Mercury-Atlas 6, had trained with John Glenn, and was considered the best-prepared astronaut. When Carpenter was given the mission, he renamed it &quot;Aurora 7&quot; for the open sky and the dawn, symbolizing the dawn of the new age. The number Seven was also chosen for the  Mercury 7 astronauts. In addition, Carpenter&#x27;s home address in his childhood was the corner of Aurora Ave. and Seventh St. in Boulder, Colorado, although at a talk he gave at the Boulder Theater in 2003, Carpenter admitted that he never made the connection between the &quot;Aurora 7&quot; spacecraft and his old address until friends pointed it out to him after he made the flight.

===Preparation===
Mercury spacecraft No. 18 was delivered to Cape Canaveral, Florida on November 15, 1961. While under checkout, the crew changed the periscope and also worked on the drogue parachute to prevent it from firing prematurely as had happened during the previous flight. In addition, a device known as a &quot;low-level commutator&quot; was added, to measure the temperature around the capsule, recording temperature data from 28 positions on the spacecraft.

Atlas vehicle 107D was rolled out of the Convair factory in San Diego, California on February 25, 1962. It was delivered to Cape Canaveral on March 6.

Changes made to Atlas 107D over Glenn&#x27;s booster were minor. It had been agreed that the insulation blanket in the tank bulkhead was unnecessary and would be removed on subsequent Mercury-Atlas vehicles, although MA-7 would still retain it. The LOX tank skin was thickened still further due to the growing weight of the Mercury capsule as missions grew longer and more ambitious. A meeting of the Flight Safety Review Board on May 16 discussed the 12 Atlas flights since Glenn&#x27;s launch and any anomalies on them that were of concern. There had been four major Atlas in-flight malfunctions during this stretch, but three were caused by random quality control defects unlikely to be a concern in the much more tightly supervised Mercury program. More concerning was Atlas 11F, which had exploded almost immediately at liftoff on April 9 and the static firing test of Atlas 1F, which exploded at Sycamore Canyon on May 13. The cause of these two mishaps was as yet unclear, but assumed to be the result of rough combustion, an old problem that had destroyed several previous Atlas vehicles. NASA ultimately decided a rough combustion failure was unlikely to be a concern as Mercury-Atlas vehicles had a three-second hold down prior to launcher release and a different engine start sequence than the Atlas F (as it turned out, the failures on 11F and 1F had an entirely different cause). The explosion of the first Atlas-Centaur shortly after liftoff on May 8 was also a momentary source of concern until postflight analysis found that the Centaur and not the Atlas had been at fault.

The temperature sensor installation and the correction of the drogue parachute circuit delayed the launch until May.

A network of ground stations and ships, called the &quot;Mercury network&quot; was arranged around the globe to provide continuous coverage of the spacecraft. On Mercury-Atlas 7, the network consisted of 15 Mercury sites supplemented by several Atlantic Missile Range (AMR) stations, and the Goddard Space Flight Center. CAPCOMs were operating from different stations around the world to communicate with Carpenter. Gus Grissom was the CAPCOM at Cape Canaveral. Alan Shepard was the CAPCOM at California.

In selecting a wristwatch for his flight, Scott Carpenter tasked Breitling with incorporating a 24-hour dial instead of the normal 12-hour dial, due to lack of day and night in space travel. Breitling produced the 24-hour Navitimer, which Carpenter wore on his 1962 space flight. The watch incorporated a slide rule on the bezel that Carpenter requested be made wider so that the slide rule could be used by an astronaut wearing thick gloves.

===Scientific experiments===
The focus of Carpenter&#x27;s five-hour mission was scientific. The full flight plan included the first study of liquids in weightlessness, Earth photography, and an unsuccessful attempt to observe a flare fired from the ground.

One of the experiments would include releasing a multi-colored balloon that would remain tethered to the capsule, observing the behavior of liquid in a weightless state inside a closed glass bottle, using a special light meter to determine the visibility of a ground flare, making weather photographs with hand-held cameras, and studying the airglow layer - for which Carpenter would receive special training. The tethered balloon was a mylar inflatable sphere, which was folded, packaged, and housed with its gas expansion bottle in the antenna canister. The whole balloon package weighed two pounds. Divided into five sections of different colors - uncolored aluminum, yellow, orange, white, and a phosphorescent coating that appeared white by day and blue by night - the balloon was to be cast off near perigee after the first orbital pass to float freely at the end of a nylon line. The purposes of the balloon experiment were to study the effects of space on the reflection properties of colored surfaces through visual observation and photographic studies and to obtain aerodynamic drag measurements by use of a strain gauge.

===During flight===

Carpenter was awakened at 1:15 AM on the morning of the flight and ate a breakfast of orange juice, filet mignon, eggs, toast, and coffee. Prior to insertion in the capsule, he was administered a hydration regimen of water, juice, coffee, and sweet tea. He ascended into the gantry at 4:36 AM, and entered the spacecraft at 4:43 AM. Unlike Mercury-Atlas 6, there was no problem with the sealing bolts.

Launch occurred at 7:45 AM (Florida time) on 24 May 1962.

Launch vehicle performance was overall excellent with one small anomaly in that one of the sustainer engine&#x27;s hydraulic switches registered a loss of sustainer hydraulic pressure and moved to the abort position at T+265 seconds. Normal hydraulic system performance was substantiated by other flight data and as two hydraulic switches had to be tripped to signal an abort to the ASIS system, nothing happened and the flight proceeded as planned. The malfunction of the hydraulic switch was believed to be the result of cold temperatures due to nearby LOX lines; on subsequent flights thermal insulation would be added to prevent a recurrence. BECO was effected at T+124 seconds and SECO at T+305 seconds. The Atlas&#x27;s flight path was so accurate that &quot;Aurora 7&quot; reached almost the exact orbital parameters planned for the mission.

Carpenter had solid food items for the first time, in the form of freeze-dried cubes in a plastic bag, instead of paste squeezed out of a tube, which produced problems with loose crumbs floating inside the cabin. The food cubes had been coated with an anti-crumbling agent, but may have accidentally been crushed prior to launch, breaking the coating. Carpenter expressed concern about crumbs being sucked into ventilation intakes in the capsule in addition to posing a possible choking hazard if ingested. In addition, a candy bar included in the food supply melted from high cabin temperatures (up to 102 °F). By the end of the second orbit, he informed Mercury Control that most of the food was a mess and he would avoid touching it for the rest of the flight aside from taking a xylose capsule.

With each orbit sunrise, Carpenter also saw the &quot;fireflies&quot;, though he observed them to be more like snowflakes. He also noted that the particles did not seem to be truly luminous, and varied in size, brightness, and color. Some were gray, some were white, and one in particular, said Carpenter, looked like a helical shaving from a lathe. Although they seemed to travel at different speeds, they did not move out and away from the spacecraft as the confetti had in the balloon experiment.

Carpenter also took 19 photos of the flattened Sun at orbit sunset.

At dawn of the third and final orbit, Carpenter inadvertently bumped his hand against the inside wall of the cabin and solved a mystery from the previous flight. The resulting bright shower of particles outside the spacecraft—what John Glenn had called &quot;fireflies&quot;—turned out to be ice particles shaken loose from the spacecraft&#x27;s exterior. Near the end of the flight, Carpenter found that by banging his hand against the wall of the capsule, he could shake more &quot;fireflies&quot; loose. At first, it was thought that the particles could be marker dye or shark repellent, both green-colored, however, testing confirmed that neither of those were likely to escape from their packages in zero gravity.

It was then suspected that the fireflies were either steam from the life support system turning into ice crystals when exposed to open space or debris on the exterior of the spacecraft being shaken loose, however, the former was considered the more probable explanation. Steam generated by the life support system formed condensation between the spacecraft bulkhead and the heat shield which then escaped into space and froze.

Like Glenn, Carpenter circled the Earth three times, with the total time spent weightless at 4 hours, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds. The performance of the Mercury spacecraft and Atlas launch vehicle was excellent in nearly every respect. All primary mission objectives were achieved. The single mission-critical malfunction which occurred involved a failure in the spacecraft pitch horizon scanner, a component of the automatic control system. This anomaly was adequately compensated for by the pilot in subsequent in-flight operations so that the success of the mission was not compromised. A modification of the spacecraft control-system thrust units was effective. Cabin and pressure-suit temperatures were high but not intolerable. Some uncertainties in the data telemetered from the bioinstrumentation prevailed at times during the flight; however, associated information was available which indicated continued well-being of the astronaut.

Carpenter was unable to spot many landmarks due to heavy cloud cover across much of the orbital path. The Southwestern US and Western Africa were clear and he could not see Florida at all.

Equipment was included in the spacecraft which provided valuable scientific information—notably that regarding liquid behavior in a weightless state, identification of the airglow layer observed by Glenn, and photography of terrestrial features and meteorological phenomena. An experiment which was to provide atmospheric drag and color visibility data in space through the deployment of an inflatable sphere was partially successful. The flight further qualified the Mercury spacecraft systems for crewed orbital operations and provided evidence for progressing into missions of extended duration and consequently more demanding systems requirements.

===Landing===
As Carpenter passed over Hawaii during the final orbit, flight director Chris Kraft told him to begin his retrofire countdown and to shift from manual control to the automatic attitude control. Partly because he had been distracted watching the fireflies, Carpenter noted that he had begun his landing preparations late. As he started to align the spacecraft he found that the automatic stabilization system would not hold the required 34-degree pitch and zero-degree yaw attitude. While trying to determine the source of the trouble, he fell behind in his check of other items. When he switched to the fly-by-wire control mode, he forgot to switch off the manual system. As a result, both systems were used together for 10 minutes, and fuel was wasted.

Noting a disagreement between his attitude indicators and what he could see from the window and the periscope, Carpenter established retrofire attitude visually; Aurora 7 was in fact aimed 25 degrees right of the true retrograde vector. In addition to the attitude error, Carpenter also activated the retrorockets three seconds late, adding another 15 miles (24 km) or so to the trajectory error. Following retro jettison, Aurora 7&#x27;s fuel gauges indicated 20% in the automatic tank and 5% in the manual tank. Carpenter intended to use his remaining manual fuel to establish reentry attitude, but found that the gauge was inaccurate and the manual tank was actually empty. Due to compounding issues and lack of fuel, Carpenter overshot his planned reentry mark and splashed down from the target.

After nearly an hour of searching, Carpenter was located in an area northeast of Puerto Rico. USS &quot;Farragut&quot; was the first ship to arrive at the spacecraft nearly forty minutes after splashdown had occurred. Two helicopters dispatched from the aircraft carrier reached the scene and transported Carpenter back to &quot;Intrepid&quot; and over the next several hours &quot;Farragut&quot; remained on the scene watching the spacecraft until USS &quot;John R. Pierce&quot; arrived with special equipment enabling her to tow &quot;Aurora 7&quot; to Roosevelt Roads Puerto Rico where it was then flown back to Cape Canaveral.

Other than slight exhaustion, Carpenter was in good health and spirits and post-flight medical exams did not find any significant physical changes or anomalies. Kraft, however, was unhappy with the astronaut&#x27;s performance due to his needlessly high expenditure of attitude control fuel, which resulted in reentry and landing taking place well off-course. As a result, Carpenter was sidelined for future missions. He left the space program in 1964 to participate in the Navy&#x27;s SEALAB program.
&quot;Aurora 7&quot; is displayed at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois.

<doc id="213241" wikidata="Q687810" url="?curid=213241" title="Chancellor of Switzerland">
<text>The federal chancellor is the head of the Federal Chancellery of Switzerland, the oldest Swiss federal institution, established at the initiative of Napoleon in 1803. The officeholder acts as the general staff of the seven-member Federal Council. The chancellor is not a member of the government and the office is not at all comparable to that of the chancellor of Germany or the chancellor of Austria, or to the United Kingdom&#x27;s chancellor of the exchequer.

The current chancellor, Viktor Rossi, a member of the Green Liberal Party from Bern, was elected on 13 December 2023. He began his term on 1 January 2024.

==Election==
The federal chancellor is elected for a four-year term by both chambers of the Federal Assembly, assembled together, at the same time (and by the same process) as it elects the Federal Council. The election is conducted by secret ballot using an exhaustive ballot in which each member of the Assembly can vote for any eligible person in the first two rounds, but only remaining candidates in subsequent rounds. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, the candidate(s) with the fewest votes is eliminated.

==Vice-Chancellors==

One or two vice-chancellors are also appointed. In contrast to the chancellor, they are appointed directly by the Federal Council. Prior to 1852, the position was called the state secretary of the Confederation. Currently, Jörg De Bernardi acts as the vice-chancellor in charge of the Federal Council&#x27;s agenda, reprising his role &quot;ad interim&quot; after the election of Viktor Rossi to the post of chancellor. In May 2024, following the sudden passing of Vice-Chancellor André Simonazzi, the Federal Council has appointed Ursula Eggenberger &quot;ad interim&quot; while searching for a permanent successor, whereas in July, Rachel Salzmann will succeed De Bernardi as vice-chancellor. 

==Role==
The position is a political appointment and has only a technocratic role.

The chancellor attends meetings of the Federal Council but does not have a vote. The chancellor also prepares the Federal Council&#x27;s reports to the Federal Assembly on its policy and activities. Still, the chancellor&#x27;s position is often referred to as that of an &quot;eighth federal councillor&quot;. The chancellery is also responsible for the publication of all federal laws.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) was the fifth United States crewed space mission, part of NASA&#x27;s Mercury program. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 spacecraft on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. crewed orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though well behind the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s durability ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963.

Planning began for the third U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight to build on the previous three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra&#x27;s pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.

The scientific results of the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth&#x27;s surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted compared with that of earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed NASA to plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.

==Background==
By 1962, both the United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a widespread perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had lasted only a few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce the gap between the two countries.

NASA announced the first two orbital missions at the end of November 1961, shortly after the Mercury-Atlas 5 (MA-5) test flight, which had carried a chimpanzee and twice orbited the Earth. MA-6 was planned as the first orbital flight, with John Glenn as the primary crew and Scott Carpenter as his backup. The follow-up mission, MA-7, was to be crewed by Deke Slayton, with Wally Schirra as his backup. In February 1962, the first draft planning began for MA-8, the third orbital mission, with a goal of &quot;six or seven&quot; orbits, as an intermediate step towards a day-long 18-orbit flight. The decision to move to six orbits rather than seven was driven by the mission rules on contingency recovery operations; a seventh orbit would have required significant additional recovery forces to be able to reach the capsule anywhere on its trajectory within eighteen hours. The six-orbit profile had other effects on the recovery plans; the optimum recovery point was moved to the Pacific Ocean, rather than the Atlantic.

On March 15, 1962, NASA announced that Slayton was medically unfit and would be replaced by Scott Carpenter as the prime crew for the MA-7 mission. The decision to replace him with Carpenter, rather than his official backup Schirra, was justified by the large amount of training Carpenter had managed while preparing for the long-delayed MA-6 mission. After the success of the MA-6 and MA-7 missions, both of three orbits, pressure began to mount to fly an extended mission. On June 27, 1962, NASA first announced its plan for the upcoming MA-8 mission, which would last for &quot;as many as six&quot; orbits. Schirra was named as the prime crew for MA-8, with Gordon Cooper as his backup, repeating the backup-one fly-one pattern set by the previous two missions. The pattern would be repeated for MA-9, flown by Cooper, and the planned but cancelled MA-10, which would have been flown by Cooper&#x27;s backup, Alan Shepard.

The Soviet Union had not flown any further flights by the time MA-7 landed, putting both sides of the Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission currently planned and press speculation about a one-day mission. However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing within a few minutes of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, using technology being developed for the Gemini program. However, after examining the time and safety implications of this proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.

===Mission objectives===

The original MA-8 flight plan was issued on July 27; although it was revised slightly in August and September, it remained broadly unchanged until launch. This was an improvement on the situation with MA-7, which had had frequent and extensive alterations, making it difficult for the pilot to train efficiently. The aim was for the flight to be an engineering-oriented mission, focusing on the operation of the spacecraft rather than on scientific experimentation, to help pave the way for a future long-duration mission.
The mission objectives involved evaluating the performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine how easy it was to control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.

Four non-engineering scientific experiments were planned, two requiring the active involvement of the astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken through a set of colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.

===Naming===

For his spacecraft, Schirra originally favored the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;, while his wife championed &quot;Pioneer&quot;. He ultimately dubbed the vessel &quot;Sigma 7&quot; because, as the mathematical symbol for the summation of elements, the name reflected that &quot;the flight was the sum of the efforts and energies of a lot of people.&quot;

The seven appended to the end was in honor of the seven original astronauts selected for Mercury, a tradition inadvertently started by prior Mercury pilot, Alan Shepard, who incorporated the seven in &quot;Freedom 7&quot; as his spacecraft was factory model no. 7. The other astronauts liked the symbolism, and so each added 7 to their spacecraft names as well.

===Spacecraft modifications===

The spacecraft and booster were almost identical to those used on the two preceding Mercury orbital flights. The spacecraft had heating blankets removed from the retrorocket motors, to save weight, and a SOFAR bomb was added. This would be ejected at the time the main parachute was deployed, and would help recovery crews find the spacecraft after it landed. A number of modifications were made to the reaction control system, and the communications equipment was upgraded.

The Atlas booster (Vehicle 113D) had been modified since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors and a new hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. There were considerable delays getting the vehicle ready for flight. It was supposed to be shipped to Cape Canaveral in July, but after failing the factory composite test at Convair, the planned delivery of the Atlas was delayed a month.

==Mission preparation==

The capsule built for the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been delivered to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. After the delayed arrival of the booster at the Cape, the Air Force then revealed that two recent static firings of MA-3 engines had suffered turbopump failures, and that the explosion of Atlas 11F one second after liftoff in April had been traced to a malfunction of the sustainer turbopump. All of these failures had occurred while the sustainer HS valve was moving to the open position and while running untested hardware modifications. The Air Force recommended that NASA conduct a static firing test of 113D just to be on the safe side. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. In the meantime, a fuel leak caused by a faulty weld in a piece of plumbing caused further delays. The static firing test was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18. The Flight Safety Review Board met on September 24 to go over the fifteen Atlas launches since Carpenter&#x27;s flight, which included three failures. Atlas 67E malfunctioned due to a random quality control fault that would be avoided with the tightly managed Mercury program, and Atlas 145D had sent Mariner 1 into the Atlantic Ocean thanks to a guidance system problem, which was of no concern to Mercury as its boosters used a different model of guidance system. Atlas 57F went off-course and was destroyed by RSO action, but more than a month later, the Air Force had not yet announced any cause of the failure.

Concerns had been raised that the radiation belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to crewed space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that it was safe to fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.

Schirra began training for the mission in early July, logging 29 hours in simulators as well as 31 hours in the spacecraft itself. This included multiple systems tests and three simulated flights, culminating in a six-and-a-half-hour simulated flight on September 29, with the spacecraft and booster fully stacked on the pad. Highlights of the training period included a visit from President John F. Kennedy on September 11.

The mission was reported as ready to go—&quot;except for the weather&quot;—on October 1. The major concern with the weather was a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, though there were also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.

==Launch==
Schirra was awakened at 1:40 am ET on the morning of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a bluefish he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the &#x27;glove compartment&#x27;, and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster&#x27;s vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.

Around three and a half minutes into the flight, Deke Slayton, the capsule communicator, cut in to ask Schirra &quot;Are you a turtle today?&quot; Schirra, unfazed, announced that he was switching to the on-board voice recorder (rather than the broadcast radio circuit) to leave his answer; the mission communications transcript noted this as &quot;[correct answer recorded]&quot;. The &quot;turtle club&quot; was a recurrent joke among the astronaut corps; on being challenged with this question, the correct response was &quot;you bet your sweet ass I am&quot;, with a failure to give the password being punishable by buying a round of drinks. Schirra noted later that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready for all the world to hear it&quot;, and chose to use the on-board recorder to avoid saying the answer over the air.

Because the Atlas was flying on a slightly lofted trajectory, the booster engines cut off 2 seconds earlier than planned, but the sustainer engine burned for about 10 seconds longer than intended, giving an extra of velocity and putting the spacecraft in a slightly higher orbit than planned. Initial analysis of the trajectory confirmed that the capsule could remain in a stable orbit for at least seven orbits, ensuring there would be no need for an early de-orbit.

==Orbital activities==
After separating from the Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, and was able to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.

Crossing over the eastern coast of Africa, he began to feel overheated; this problem was also apparent to the ground controllers, who were having a debate with the flight surgeon over whether it was safe to continue or if the mission should be ended after the first orbit. The flight director, Christopher Kraft, followed the surgeon&#x27;s advice to see if the problem would settle, and gave the go for a second orbit. Schirra eventually stabilized the problem over time, slowly dialing the suit&#x27;s control knob to a high cooling setting; he compared the heat to that of &quot;mowing a lawn in Texas&quot;.

Over Australia, Schirra watched for a flare launched from the ground, but it was occluded by clouds; he was, however, able to see lightning and the lit outline of Brisbane. Through the night pass over the Pacific, he tested the capsule&#x27;s on-board periscope, though he found it difficult to use and quickly covered it up as soon as the sun rose. Crossing over Mexico, he reported that he was in &quot;chimp configuration&quot;, with the capsule running entirely on automatic without any input from the pilot, and as he began his second orbit began testing a yaw maneuver using the Earth through the main window as a reference, rather than via the much-maligned periscope.

On the second orbit, he confirmed the existence of Glenn&#x27;s &quot;fireflies&quot;, the shower of small bright particles first reported on MA-6, and during the night section practiced yaw manoeuvres using first the Moon and then known stars as reference points. The second proved difficult to work with, as the small windows of the Mercury capsule gave a very limited field of view, making it hard to identify constellations. Travelling across the Pacific, he again fell back into automatic flight, chatting with Gus Grissom at the Hawaiian tracking station about the qualities of the manual control system.

As he began the third orbit, Schirra disconnected the spacecraft&#x27;s gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.

On the fourth orbit, drifting in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth &#x27;above&#x27; him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States on radio and television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.

By the fifth orbit, Schirra had begun to relax, commenting that it was the first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord exercise device for &quot;a little bit of stretching&quot;, before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on &quot;in Spanish to the fellows down here&quot;, and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery &quot;Buenos Dias, y&#x27;all!&quot; Schirra later noted that he was &quot;furious&quot; at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn&#x27;t want to be distracted with making public statements.

The sixth orbit was dominated by preparations for re-entry, though Schirra was able to take a last set of photographs of South America and try another set of spatial-orientation tests. He armed the retrorockets passing over the western Pacific, and fired the first one at 8:52 mission elapsed time. The automatic control system held the capsule &quot;steady as a rock&quot; during this period, though after the retrorockets had stopped firing Schirra noted that the system had burned almost a quarter of its fuel in the process.

==Reentry and recovery==


As the spacecraft continued towards re-entry after the de-orbit burn, Schirra used the high-power thrusters to put the capsule in the correct orientation, noting that the attitude control felt &quot;sloppy&quot;. He then enabled the rate stabilization control system, an automatic control method which used up fuel at a very high rate, to maintain control during re-entry; this was a specific engineering request, and it dismayed Schirra to see the fuel he had husbanded for six orbits be used so quickly.

The local recovery group in the prime target area, in the central Pacific, consisted of an aircraft carrier, , in the center of the landing area, with three destroyers strung out along the orbital path. Four search aircraft were also assigned to the area, and three recovery helicopters were based aboard &quot;Kearsarge&quot;.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; picked up the capsule on radar while still from landing; further up the landing path, the destroyer reported a sonic boom as it passed overhead. At , Schirra deployed the drogue parachute, and then the main parachute at . The landing was surprisingly precise, from the target point and from &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, and Schirra joked that he was on course for the recovery carrier&#x27;s &quot;number three elevator&quot;. The capsule hit the water, submerged, and bobbed to the surface again, righting itself after about 30 seconds. Three pararescue swimmers were dropped by one of the helicopters to help him climb out, but Schirra radioed that he would prefer to be towed to the carrier, and a whaleboat from &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was sent with a line.

Forty minutes after landing, &quot;Sigma 7&quot; was hoisted aboard &quot;Kearsarge&quot;; five minutes later, Schirra blew the explosive hatch and climbed out to a waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom&#x27;s hatch expulsion accident during the &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; the fact that he had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.
Schirra remained aboard for three days of medical tests and debriefing before disembarking, while the spacecraft was offloaded at Midway Island and transferred to an aircraft for further transport. It was returned to Cape Canaveral for analysis, with the long-term intention of putting it on permanent display.

The spent Atlas booster re-entered the atmosphere on October 4, the day after the launch, and burned up.

==Post-flight==
The post-flight analysis reported no major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— and all the engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed. The fuel-conservation measures were found to have worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full credit for this to the pilot. The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness, and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure. Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed that there had been a very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft, and the six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.

Scientifically, the light-observation experiments were unsuccessful, as both target locations were covered by thick cloud cover. However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted the lights of a city a few hundred miles from Durban. The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15 photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14 photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover. In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems. Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of orthostatic hypotension caused by sitting inside the cramped capsule for hours.

Schirra&#x27;s post-flight report noted the &quot;fireflies&quot; seen on the previous two missions, and emphasized the remarkable visual effect of the thick band of the atmosphere visible around the horizon. However, he was unimpressed with the view of Earth from space; the amount of detail he could make out compared well with that from high-flying aircraft, and he told debriefers that it was &quot;nothing new&quot; compared to flight at . Overall, he concluded that &quot;Sigma 7&quot; was on &quot;the top of the list&quot; of aircraft he had flown, displacing the F8F Bearcat, a naval piston-engined fighter, while the mission itself had been &quot;textbook&quot;.

Schirra gave a public lecture at Rice University after returning to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra&#x27;s successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert F. Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, the same way he had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission in 1965, then the prime crew for the Gemini 6A mission later that year, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft—earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled—and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.

The success of MA-8 made the preparation for MA-9 &quot;considerably easier&quot;, though it did cause some observers to suggest the program should be ended abruptly in order to conclude on a clear note of success, rather than risking another—potentially catastrophic—flight. However, this was not a view shared by the NASA planners, who had been pressing for a one-day Mercury mission since mid-1961, when it first began to seem technically feasible. To prepare the spacecraft for a long-duration mission involved trimming as much on-board weight as possible to offset the additional consumables required. The changes made to the capsule hardware on MA-8 were now used to justify the removal of of control equipment and of radio equipment, as well as the periscope which Schirra had found so unhelpful. In total, there were 183 alterations listed between the capsules for the MA-8 and MA-9 missions. The spacecraft was to be equipped with several cameras, building on Schirra&#x27;s photographic work, though weight and power limitations did restrict the amount of scientific experiments that could be scheduled.

==Spacecraft location==
After display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center and Johnson Space Center, the capsule was moved to the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame near Titusville, Florida. Since the recent relocation of the Astronaut Hall of Fame to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, &quot;Sigma 7&quot; has most recently been placed on display at the complex&#x27;s new Heroes and Legends Hall.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 9 was the final crewed space mission of the U.S. Mercury program, launched on May 15, 1963, from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The spacecraft, named Faith 7, completed 22 Earth orbits before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, piloted by astronaut Gordon Cooper, then a United States Air Force major. The Atlas rocket was No. 130-D, and the Mercury spacecraft was No. 20. As of , this mission marks the last time an American was launched alone to conduct an entirely solo orbital mission.

==Mission background==
===Debate over Mercury project continuation===
The Mercury-Atlas 8 flight of Walter Schirra on October 3, 1962, had been so nearly perfect that some at NASA thought that the United States should quit while it was ahead and make MA-8 the last Mercury mission rather than risk a future disaster. The argument that MA-8 should be the last Mercury mission held that NASA had pushed the first-generation Mercury hardware far enough, and taking more chances on another longer mission was not warranted; instead, NASA should move on to the Gemini program.
Manned Spacecraft Center officials, however, believed that the Mercury team should be given the chance to test a human in space for a full day. In addition, all of the Soviet single-seat Vostok spacecraft launched after Vostok 1 lasted for more than a day; thus the Mercury 9 flight would bring the Mercury spacecraft up to the same level as that of the Soviets.

===Mission planning===
In September 1962, NASA concluded negotiations with McDonnell to modify four Mercury spacecraft (#12, #15, #17 and #20) to a configuration that supported a one-day mission. Such changes to the spacecraft included the removal of the periscope and a redundant set of thrusters, and the addition of extra batteries and oxygen tanks.

In November 1962, Gordon Cooper was chosen to pilot the MA-9 mission and Alan Shepard was picked as backup.

On April 22, 1963, Atlas booster 130-D and Mercury spacecraft #20 were stacked on the launch pad at Launch Complex 14.

Because MA-9 would orbit over nearly every part of the world from 32.5 degrees north to 32.5 degrees south, a total of 28 ships, 171 aircraft, and 18,000 servicemen were assigned to support the mission.


The Atlas booster used for MA-9 sported several technical improvements, most notably an enhanced propulsion system with a hypergolic igniter that would eliminate the need for hold-down time at launch to prevent rough combustion. With seven successful Mercury launches in a row, the failures of the early days seemed like a distant memory by early 1963 and NASA officials had a high degree of confidence in the Atlas that overshadowed its still spotty launch record. At the first meeting of senior MSFC officials for the year (January 11), Walter Williams noted that the Air Force had yet to provide an explanation for two Atlas F failures during the second half of 1962. Until the investigation committees released their findings and cleared the Atlas D of guilt by association, Cooper&#x27;s flight could be delayed. During the seven months between Schirra&#x27;s and Cooper&#x27;s flights, there were five failures of Atlas D vehicles (one of them an Atlas-Agena, the rest operational ICBM tests). NASA did not let its guard down on the Atlas, despite the recent high degree of success enjoyed by Project Mercury.

When Atlas 130D received its factory rollout on January 30, it was found to have damaged wiring and had to be sent back for repairs. At his first press conference on February 8, Gordon Cooper admitted to not knowing much about the booster problems and focused instead on the enhancements made to his Mercury capsule. The numerous added equipment and consumables for the day-long mission boosted the weight of &quot;Faith&quot; 7 considerably; it now weighed over .

On March 15, the Atlas was rolled out of the factory a second time and passed tests with flying colors; Convair engineers expressed confidence that this &quot;was their best bird yet.&quot; The booster actuators were offset slightly to prevent a recurrence of the liftoff roll transient that occurred on Mercury-Atlas 8. Several minor modifications were made to 130D as a result of postflight findings from failed Atlas launches over the previous year. These included adding a plastic liner to the inside of the turbopumps to prevent the turbine blades from rubbing against the casing and triggering an explosion from a friction spark, improvements to the wiring of the programmer, and additional steps taken to prevent the possibility of a fire breaking out in or around the thrust section.

The upgraded MA-2 engines featured baffled injector heads and a hypergolic igniter, eliminating any concerns of rough combustion or the need for hold-down time prior to liftoff. As such, the RCC (Rough Combustion Cutoff) sensors on 130D were operated open loop and for qualitative purposes only. The propellant conserved by not performing the three second hold-down time would allow a longer booster burn. On Mercury-Atlas 8, 112 gallons of fuel were removed prior to launch and so an extended burn was not possible even with eliminating the hold-down, but on this flight there would be enough propellant to extend burn time.

Cooper&#x27;s decision to name his capsule &quot;Faith 7&quot; was based on the faith he had in the Atlas booster and Mercury capsule to carry out the mission successfully, although it was reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that some NASA officials were skeptical of the idea.

==Mission highlights==

When Cooper boarded &quot;Faith 7&quot; at 6:36 AM on the morning of May 14, he found a little gift that had been left for him. Alan Shepard, knowing that Cooper would have a new version of the urine containment device that Shepard did not have on his Mercury-Redstone 3 flight (forcing him to relieve himself during a long countdown hold), had left behind a toilet plunger as a joke. Instructions on the handle said, &quot;Remove Before Launch&quot;. The gift did not make the trip. Neither did Cooper that day. Various problems with radar in Bermuda and the diesel engine that rolled back the gantry caused the launch to be cancelled until May 15.

At 8:04:13 a.m. EST, May 15, 1963, &quot;Faith 7&quot; was launched from Launch Complex 14. At T+60 seconds, the Atlas started its pitch program. Shortly afterward, MA-9 passed through max Q. At T+2 minutes 14 seconds Cooper felt BECO (Booster Engine Cutoff) and staging. The two Atlas booster engines had been left behind. The Launch Escape Tower was then jettisoned. At T+3 minutes the cabin pressure sealed at . Cooper reported, &quot;Faith 7 is all go.&quot;

At about T+5 minutes was SECO (Sustainer Engine Cutoff) and &quot;Faith 7&quot; entered orbit at 17,547 mph (7,844 m/s). After the spacecraft separated and turned around to orbit attitude, Cooper watched the spent Atlas lag behind and tumble for about eight minutes. Over Zanzibar on the first orbit, he learned that the orbital parameters were good enough for at least 20 orbits. As the spacecraft passed over Guaymas, Mexico still on the first orbit, capsule communicator Gus Grissom told Cooper the ground computers said he was &quot;go for seven orbits.&quot;

Atlas performance was overall excellent. The upgraded propulsion system worked well, with slightly above nominal booster engine thrust. Measurable propellant slosh occurred from T+55 to T+120 seconds, caused by slightly lower than nominal autopilot gains. The flight trajectory was slightly more lofted than nominal due to the DC voltage in the booster electrical system being about 0.7 volts above normal, but this was counteracted by the higher than nominal booster engine performance. BECO took place at T+127 seconds, escape tower jettison at T+141 seconds, and SECO at T+301 seconds.

At the start of the third orbit, Cooper checked his list of 11 experiments that were on his schedule. His first task was to eject a six-inch (152 mm) diameter sphere, equipped with xenon strobe lights, from the nose of the spacecraft. This experiment was designed to test his ability to spot and track a flashing beacon in orbit. At T+3 hours 25 minutes, Cooper flipped the switch and heard and felt the beacon detach from the spacecraft. He tried to see the flashing light in the approaching dusk and on the nightside pass, but failed to do so. On the fourth orbit, he did spot the beacon and saw it pulsing. Cooper reported to Scott Carpenter on Kauai, Hawaii, &quot;I was with the little rascal all night.&quot; He also spotted the beacon on his fifth and sixth orbits.

Also on the sixth orbit, at about T+9 hours, Cooper set up cameras, adjusted the spacecraft attitude and set switches to deploy a tethered balloon from the nose of the spacecraft. It was a PET film balloon painted fluorescent orange, inflated with nitrogen and attached to a nylon line from the antenna canister. A strain gauge in the antenna canister would measure differences in atmospheric drag between the perigee and the apogee. Cooper tried several times to eject the balloon, but it failed to eject.

Cooper passed Schirra&#x27;s orbital record on the seventh orbit while he was engaged in radiation experiments. After 10 hours, the Zanzibar tracking station informed Cooper the flight was a go for 17 orbits. Cooper was orbiting the Earth every 88 minutes 45 seconds at an inclination of 32.55 degrees to the equator.

His scheduled rest period was during orbits 9 through 13. He had a dinner of powdered roast beef mush and some water, took pictures of Asia and reported the spacecraft condition. Cooper was not sleepy and during orbit 9 took some of the best photos made during his flight. He took pictures of the Tibetan highlands and of the Himalayas.

During the flight Cooper reported that he could see roads, rivers, small villages, and even individual houses if the lighting and background conditions were right. This was later confirmed by the two-person Gemini crews that later flew (which included Cooper). Cooper slept intermittently the next six hours, during orbits 10 through 13. He woke from time to time and took more pictures, taped status reports, and kept adjusting his spacesuit temperature control which kept getting too hot or too cold.

On his fourteenth orbit, Cooper took an assessment of the spacecraft condition. The oxygen supply was sufficient. The peroxide fuel for attitude control was 69 percent in the automatic tank and 95 percent in the manual one. On the fifteenth orbit, he spent most of the time calibrating equipment and synchronizing clocks.

When he entered night on the sixteenth orbit, Cooper pitched the spacecraft to slowly follow the plane of the ecliptic. Through the spacecraft window he viewed the zodiacal light and night airglow layer. He took pictures of these two &quot;dim light&quot; phenomena from Zanzibar, across the Earth&#x27;s nightside, to Canton Island. The pictures were later found to have been overexposed, but they still contained valuable data. Cooper obtained photographs of North Africa, the Arabian peninsula, and eastern India, Burma, and the Himalaya region, as well as a few images of the Pacific and Indian Ocean.

Worldwide weather conditions during the flight were extremely favorable with most of the regions of the Earth the spacecraft passed over dominated by high pressure zones--in the three previous flights, only the Western Sahara and Southwestern United States were reliably cloudless. Nonetheless, haze and air pollution impeded visibility for Cooper--despite passing over Los Angeles and Calcutta, he could see neither city due to smog.

At the start of the 17th orbit while crossing Cape Canaveral, Florida, Cooper transmitted slow scan black and white television pictures to Mercury Control. The picture showed a ghostly image of the astronaut. In the murky picture, a helmet and hoses could be seen. It was the first time an American astronaut had sent back television images from space.

On the 17th and 18th orbits, Cooper took infrared weather photos and moonset Earth-limb pictures. He also resumed Geiger counter measurements of radiation. He sang during orbits 18 and 19, and marveled at the greenery of Earth. It was nearing 30 hours since liftoff.

==Technical problems on the flight==

On the 19th orbit, the first sign of trouble appeared when the spacecraft 0.05 g (0.5 m/s2) light came on. However, this turned out to be a faulty indicator, and the spacecraft was not reentering. On the 20th orbit, Cooper lost all attitude readings. The 21st orbit saw a short-circuit occur in the bus bar serving the 250 VA (115 V, 400 Hz) main inverter. This left the automatic stabilization and control system without electric power.

On the 21st orbit, John Glenn on board the tracking ship &quot;Coastal Sentry Quebec&quot; near Kyushu, Japan, helped Cooper prepare a revised checklist for retrofire. Due to the system malfunctions, many of the steps would have to be done manually. Only Hawaii and Zanzibar were in radio range on this last orbit, but communications were good. Cooper noted that the carbon dioxide level was rising in the cabin and in his spacesuit. He told Carpenter as he passed over Zanzibar, &quot;Things are beginning to stack up a little.&quot; Throughout the problems, Cooper remained cool, calm and collected.

Cooper did not experience much of an appetite during the flight and ate only because it was scheduled. The food containers and water dispenser system proved unwieldy and he was not able to properly prepare freeze-dried food packages, so he limited his consumption to cubed food and bite-sized sandwiches. Cooper found the cubed food largely unpalatable, which contributed to his lack of eating. He had no difficulty urinating during the flight and the urine collection system worked well, although transferring urine to storage bags in the cramped capsule proved difficult. Cooper took several naps during the flight, lasting about an hour each. He experienced some discomfort from the pressure suit compressing his knees, which he alleviated by moving his feet slightly upward. An hour and 20 minutes before retrofire, Cooper took a dextroamphetamine tablet to ensure his alertness; he reported not feeling any sleepiness for the remainder of the flight.

At the end of the 21st orbit, Cooper again contacted Glenn on &quot;Coastal Sentry Quebec&quot;. He reported the spacecraft was in retro attitude and holding manually. The checklist was complete. Glenn gave a ten-second countdown to retrofire. Cooper kept the spacecraft aligned at a 34° pitchdown angle and manually fired the retrorockets on &quot;Mark!&quot;.

Cooper had drawn lines on the window to stay aligned with constellations as he flew the craft. He later said he used his wristwatch to time the burn and his eyes to maintain attitude.

Fifteen minutes later &quot;Faith 7&quot; landed just four miles (6 km) from the prime recovery ship, the carrier USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. This was the most accurate landing to date, despite the lack of automatic controls. &quot;Faith 7&quot; landed southeast of Midway Island, in the Pacific Ocean. This would be near .

Splashdown was at 34 hours 19 minutes 49 seconds after liftoff. The spacecraft tipped over in the water momentarily, then righted itself. Helicopters dropped rescue swimmers and relayed Cooper&#x27;s request of an Air Force officer for permission to be hoisted aboard the Navy&#x27;s carrier. Permission was granted. Forty minutes later the explosive hatch blew open on the deck of &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. Cooper stepped out of &quot;Faith 7&quot; to a warm greeting.

Postflight medical examination of Cooper found that he was slightly dehydrated and experienced a degree of orthostatic hypotension from being seated in the capsule an entire day, but other than that no significant effects from the flight were noted.

After the MA-9 mission, there was another debate about whether to fly one more Mercury flight, Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10). It was proposed as a three-day, 48-orbit mission to be flown by Alan Shepard in October 1963. In the end, NASA officials decided it was time to move on to Project Gemini and MA-10 never flew.

The Mercury program had fulfilled all of its goals.

<text>Alien Resurrection is a 1997 American science fiction horror film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, written by Joss Whedon, and starring Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder. It is the fourth installment of the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, and was filmed at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles, California.

In the film, set 200 years after the preceding installment, &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), Ellen Ripley is cloned, and an Alien queen is surgically removed from her body. The United Systems Military (USM) hopes to breed Aliens to study and research on the spaceship USM &quot;Auriga&quot;, using human hosts abducted and delivered to them by a group of mercenaries. The Aliens escape their enclosures, and Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to escape and destroy the &quot;Auriga&quot; before it reaches Earth. Additional roles are played by Ron Perlman, Dan Hedaya, J. E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, and Michael Wincott.

&quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; had its premiere in Paris on November 6, 1997, and was released to the public on November 12. It grossed US $47.8 million in the United States and Canada, making it the least successful of the &quot;Alien&quot; series in that market. It grossed $161 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the screenplay but praised Weaver&#x27;s performance and Jeunet&#x27;s direction. The film was nominated for six Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress for Weaver, Best Supporting Actress for Ryder, and Best Direction for Jeunet.

A sequel to &quot;Resurrection&quot; was planned, as Whedon had written an earth-set script for &quot;Alien 5&quot;. Sigourney Weaver was not interested in this setting, but has remained open to reprising her role as Ellen Ripley on the condition that she likes the story. More sequels were planned to follow &quot;Resurrection&quot;, but were ultimately abandoned as the crossover series arrived with the 2004 film &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, along with the prequel series including the 2012 film &quot;Prometheus&quot;. The storylines of &quot;Resurrection&quot; have been continued in the comic series &quot;Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator&quot;, and books &quot;&quot; and &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot;.

==Plot==
200 years after the events of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, military scientists aboard the space vessel USM &quot;Auriga&quot; create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The Xenomorph queen&#x27;s DNA has been combined with Ripley&#x27;s, resulting in the clone growing up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the Xenomorph queen&#x27;s DNA, the clone possesses enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and a psychic link with the Xenomorphs, making her more empathetic toward them than the humans she encounters. Additionally, the Xenomorph&#x27;s genetic memory allows the clone to retain some of Ripley&#x27;s memories.

A group of mercenaries—Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess, Hillard, and Call—arrives at the &quot;Auriga&quot; on their ship, the &quot;Betty&quot;, delivering several abducted humans in stasis. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the aliens, raising several adult Xenomorphs for study.

The &quot;Betty&quot; crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and attempts to kill her, suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to create Xenomorphs, but the creatures have already been cloned. The mature Xenomorphs escape confinement by killing one of their own and using its acidic blood to burn through their enclosures. They capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman, damage the &quot;Auriga&quot;, and kill most of the crew who fail to evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship&#x27;s default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this would unleash the Xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a soldier named DiStephano, and surviving Xenomorph host Purvis decide to head for the &quot;Betty&quot; and use it to destroy the &quot;Auriga&quot;. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory containing the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. One survivor begs Ripley 8 to euthanize her; she hesitantly complies and then incinerates the lab.

As the group navigates the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen, pursued by two Xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the Xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the creature. Wren betrays the group and shoots Call, revealing in her survival that she is an android. Using her ability to interface with the &quot;Auriga&quot;&#x27;s systems, Call sets the ship on a collision course with Earth, hoping to destroy the Xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren&#x27;s escape route and directs the Xenomorphs toward him. Ripley 8 is captured by a Xenomorph while the others head for the &quot;Betty&quot;. Wren, already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage, and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks and grapples Wren, causing his Xenomorph embryo&#x27;s emergence to kill them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile Xenomorph.

Ripley 8 is taken to the Xenomorph nest, where she finds Gediman alive and partially cocooned. The Xenomorph queen, having developed a uterus due to her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a Xenomorph with overtly human traits. Unable to bond with the queen, the hybrid Xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother and kills the Xenomorph queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to escape and makes her way to the &quot;Betty&quot;.

The newborn hybrid reaches the ship and attacks Call, killing DiStephano when he tries to help her. Ripley 8 saves Call by distracting the hybrid. Using her acidic blood, Ripley 8 melts a hole in a window and pushes the hybrid towards it. Ripley 8 tearfully watches as the decompression violently eviscerates the creature through the hole and blows its pulverized remains out into space.

The countdown on the &quot;Auriga&quot; continues as Ripley 8, Call, Johner, and Vriess escape in the &quot;Betty&quot;. The &quot;Auriga&quot; collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As they look down at Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 wants to do next. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m a stranger here myself,&quot; she replies.

** Joan La Barbara and Archie Hahn as The Newborn (voice)
* Steven Gilborn as Father (voice). The artificial intelligence system of the USM &quot;Auriga&quot;.
==Production==
===Origins===
Impressed with his work as a screenwriter, 20th Century Fox hired Joss Whedon to write the film&#x27;s script. Whedon&#x27;s initial screenplay had a third act on Earth, with a final battle for Earth itself. Whedon wrote five versions of the final act, none of which ended up in the film.

The studio initially imagined that the film would center around a clone of the character Newt from &quot;Aliens&quot;, as the Ellen Ripley character had died at the end of &quot;Alien 3&quot;. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script in a way that would bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.

Sigourney Weaver, who had played Ripley throughout the series, wanted to liberate the character in &quot;Alien 3&quot; as she did not want Ripley to become &quot;a figure of fun&quot; who would continuously &quot;wake up with monsters running around&quot;. The possibility of an &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; film was another reason for the character&#x27;s death, as she thought the concept &quot;sounded awful&quot;. However, Weaver was impressed with Whedon&#x27;s script. She thought that the error during Ripley&#x27;s cloning process would allow her to further explore the character, since Ripley becoming part-human and part-Alien would create uncertainty about where her loyalties lay. This was an interesting concept to Weaver, who thought the film brought back the spirit of &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;. Weaver received a co-producer credit and was reportedly paid $11 million.

===Direction and design===
&quot;Trainspotting&quot; director Danny Boyle was the producers&#x27; first choice to direct the film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, but he was not interested in pursuing the project and went on to make &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an &quot;Alien&quot; film. In 1995, after the release of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film&#x27;s producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to &quot;Amélie&quot; and was surprised he was offered the job for &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, as he thought the franchise had finished with &quot;Alien 3&quot; and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.

Jeunet hired French special effects supervisor Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, both of whom he had worked with on &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;. Nigel Phelps was chosen for production designer, having made a name for himself designing Gotham City in &quot;Batman&quot; and Mega-City One in &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and &quot;Alien&quot; films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the &quot;Alien&quot; films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet&#x27;s frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters&#x27; costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.

===Creatures===

Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the film, having previously worked on &quot;Alien 3&quot;. ADI founders Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis also had experience working with Stan Winston on &quot;Aliens&quot;. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film&#x27;s script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the director&#x27;s approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models. Referring to the use of animatronics in the film, Twentieth Century Fox executive Tom Rothman stated, &quot;Most movies would be tempted to do the Newborn digitally ... [but] it looks so much more real when you [use] animatronics&quot;.

Jeunet asked ADI to lean towards making the human/Alien hybrid creature more human than Alien. An early concept was to replicate Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s features, although the crew felt this design would be too similar to the design of the creature Sil from the 1995 film &quot;Species&quot;. Eyes and a nose were added to the hybrid to allow it to have more expressions and communicate more emotion than the xenomorphs, so that it would have more depth as a character rather than being &quot;just a killing machine&quot;. Jeunet was adamant about the hybrid having genitalia which resembled a mix of male and female sexes. 20th Century Fox was uncomfortable with this, however, and Jeunet eventually changed his mind, feeling that &quot;even for a Frenchman, it&#x27;s too much&quot;. The genitalia were removed during post-production using digital effects techniques. The animatronic hybrid required nine puppeteers and was the most complex animatronic in the film.

===Filming===
&quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; was filmed at Fox studios in Los Angeles, California, from October 1996 to February 1997. Jeunet had difficulty securing studio space, as the filming of Hollywood blockbusters such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; were taking place at the same time. &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; was the first installment in the &quot;Alien&quot; series to be filmed outside England, a decision made by Weaver, who believed that the previous films&#x27; travel schedules exhausted the crew.

The underwater scene was the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36-by-45-meter tank, 4.5 meters deep, containing 548,000 gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would be able to use the tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.

Weaver had the idea that as an example of Ripley&#x27;s new powers, there could be a scene in which she threw a basketball through a hoop backwards. Jeunet was concerned that the shot would require hundreds of takes, and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI), but Weaver was determined to make the shot authentic and insisted on doing it herself. After training for a month, during which she averaged one out of six baskets, she arrived on set on the day of filming to find that the set was built to require a much longer shot than she had practiced for. Despite this, on the first take she made the throw perfectly. It amazed the cast and crew, and caused Ron Perlman to break character and turn to the camera to say &quot;Oh my god!&quot;, leading to fears that he had ruined the once in a lifetime take. However, there was enough of a pause between Weaver&#x27;s basket and Perlman&#x27;s statement for the film&#x27;s editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused.

===Visual effects and miniatures===
The film&#x27;s script was laid out similar to a comic book, with pictures on the left and dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company&#x27;s work on &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot; creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures&#x27; legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.

All of the spaceships in the film were miniatures, as visual effects supervisors believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM &quot;Auriga&quot; was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film&#x27;s opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory in the film&#x27;s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin&#x27;s design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz&#x27;s design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.

Argonaut Games, developer of the film&#x27;s tie-in video game, was also tasked to create a game that would appear in the film titled &quot;Atom Zone&quot;. The game was created within a time frame of a few days and involved the building of custom hardware to run the game which briefly appears during the film&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;Betty&quot;″s crew.

==Music==

Composer John Frizzell was encouraged by a friend to audition to compose &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;&#x27;s film score. Frizzell sent in four cassettes and received a call from 20th Century Fox about the fourth, which contained music from &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot;. Impressed with his work, Fox representative Robert Kraft had a short meeting with Frizzell and hired him. At that time, Frizzell was a newcomer in film composing history, having previously worked on &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; and &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;. He spent seven months writing and recording the score, which Jeunet requested to be very different and unique from the previous films in the series. This included themes of romance and eroticism, incorporating sound effects such as a gong and rub rod. The cue &quot;They Swim&quot; took one month to complete as Jeunet was not pleased with Frizzell&#x27;s original version, although the final result was a mix between the first and third versions he had composed. &quot;I&#x27;m Popeye the Sailor Man&quot;, Popeye&#x27;s theme song, written by Sammy Lerner, is whistled by Dom Vriess and is acknowledged in the credits.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film had its premiere in Paris on November 6, 1997 before opening in France on November 12. It opened in the United States and Canada on November 26.

===Home media===
&quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; was first released onto home-video in the VHS, LaserDisc and DVD formats on June 2, 1998. The film received its first Blu-ray release as part of the &quot;Alien Anthology&quot; box set released in 2010 including all four films and their alternate versions. The film was re-released on Blu-ray on May 10, 2011, in a stand-alone feature.

===Special editions===
In 2003, Jeunet included an alternate version of the film on the &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; DVD box set with different opening and closing scenes, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from &quot;Aliens&quot;; Vriess making a joke to Call; Ripley&#x27;s clone waking up in the middle of her operation; an extended conversation between General Perez and Elgyn; an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the eventual fate of Ripley&#x27;s former employers, Weyland–Yutani; an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley&#x27;s clone in the chapel; and scenes of the &quot;Betty&quot; landing on Earth and the planet&#x27;s landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds&#x27; worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than the theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director&#x27;s cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut. &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; contains a documentary called &quot;One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection&quot;, featuring over two hours of footage relating to pre-production, production, post-production, screen tests, concept art, and audio commentary by the cast and crew. &quot;Alien Resurrection – Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, which also includes &quot;One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection&quot;, was released on January 6, 2004.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; opened in France on November 12, 1997 on 507 screens and had over 1 million admissions for the week with a gross of $6,754,530, finishing at the top of the French box office. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 26. Debuting at number two at the box office behind &quot;Flubber&quot;, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; grossed $25 million in its first five days—$16 million over the weekend, for an average of $6,821 per 2,415 theaters. It went on to gross $47.8 million in the United States and Canada, making it the lowest-grossing installment of the &quot;Alien&quot; series in that market. It was well received internationally, however, with a gross of $113.6 million, bringing its total gross to $161.4 million. It was the 43rd-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada in 1997.

In the UK, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; beat out &quot;The Full Monty&quot; to reach the number one spot, collecting $4.4 million during its opening weekend. It surpassed &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; for having the highest opening weekend for an 18 certificate film, a record held until the release of &quot;American Beauty&quot; in 2000. The film also had the second-highest opening for a 20th Century Fox film in Spain, behind &quot;Independence Day&quot;.

===Critical response===

, 55% of the reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, and have an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s feral performance as a resurrected Ripley restores some fun to the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise, the acid blood running through this fourth entry&#x27;s veins corrodes whatever emotional investment audiences had left.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a score of 63 out of 100, based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Lisa Schwarzbaum from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film &quot;B+&quot; and stated &quot;By rocketing ahead 200 years from the previous film and jiggering the story cleverly [...] to create a Ripley reconstructed through a mix of human and alien DNA, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; power-kicks the whole definition of the Horrifying Other into a fresh, deep, exhilaratingly thoughtful, millennium-sensitive direction&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot;&#x27;s Alan Jones described the film as &quot;tense, mordantly funny, very graphic, and bloody&quot;, and praised Weaver in a four out of five stars review. &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; editor Louis B. Parks said &quot;The film is a marvel, a well-photographed feast of visual imagery&quot;, while Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that it was &quot;Less frightening, but as much fun as ever&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; contributor Desson Thomson felt it &quot;satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful. And most significantly, it makes a big hoot of the whole business&quot;. Andrew Johnston commented in &quot;Time Out New York&quot; that &quot;If Ripley, Call, and the pirates had been developed further, the film might have been as involving as James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot;, the gold-standard of the series. The film&#x27;s Techno-Gothic look is gorgeously immersive, however, and Jeunet turns in a number of original (and grotesque) effects sequences that are worth the price of admission&quot;. &quot;Salon&quot;′s Laura Miller noted &quot;Weaver obviously relishes playing this feral, sarcastic new Ripley, and her pleasure is infectious&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Peter Travers&#x27;s review was mostly positive, writing that the film &quot;is sometimes glib and repetitive, but it stays worthy of its predecessors by staying close to its two battered heroines&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine&#x27;s Maitland McDonagh wrote in her mixed review: &quot;The plot is more of the same old running and screaming, but Weaver is worth the price of admission all by herself, which is just as well in light of the less-than-fleshed-out characters by whom she&#x27;s surrounded.&quot; James Berardinelli also gave a mixed review at &quot;ReelViews&quot; by writing &quot;If you consider &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; to be the main course, then &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; is leftovers&quot;. Jeffery Overstreet of &quot;Looking closer&quot; rated the film &quot;C+&quot; and commented &quot;What began as the most menacing movie monster of all has evolved into a whining oaf that looks like it&#x27;s been dipped in a vat of Cream of Wheat&quot;. Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;The filmmaker&#x27;s ghoulishly fecund imagination makes this tale ... so murky that even the screen&#x27;s toughest woman-warrior remains largely stuck in the mud.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, stating &quot;There is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder&quot;, 

Screenwriter Joss Whedon was unhappy with the final product, remarking that it closely followed his script but was poorly executed. Conversely, H. R. Giger, designer of the original Alien, was pleased with &quot;Resurrection&quot;, describing it as an &quot;excellent film&quot;, but was disappointed about not being credited. For the 25th anniversary of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet watched a 35mm print of the film: “I was a little bit concerned to watch my film – maybe I won’t like it?” he says. “No, it was great! I have a lot of shots that I love. For the people who don’t like it, I can say, ‘f*** you!’”

===Future===

Joss Whedon had written an Earth-set script for &quot;Alien 5&quot;, but Sigourney Weaver was not interested in this setting and sought to return the story to the planetoid from the first film. Weaver has remained open to a role in a fifth installment on the condition that she likes the story. Before 20th Century Fox greenlit &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, James Cameron had been collaborating on the plot for a fifth &quot;Alien&quot; film with another writer. Learning of Fox&#x27;s plans for a crossover, he ceased work on his concept. Before he saw the film, Cameron had stated that it would &quot;kill the validity of the franchise&quot;, and that &quot;it was &quot;Frankenstein Meets Werewolf&quot;&quot;—like &quot;Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other&quot;. Although he later admitted to liking &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, Cameron ruled out any future involvement with the series.

In a 2002 interview, Ridley Scott stated that a new &quot;Alien&quot; project &quot;would be a lot of fun&quot;, but that &quot;the most important thing was to get the story right&quot;. Scott&#x27;s concept for the plot was &quot;to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created&quot;. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an &quot;Alien&quot; spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley&#x27;s story has not materialized. Instead, &quot;Prometheus&quot; was released on June 8, 2012. A sequel to &quot;Prometheus&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;, was released on May 19, 2017.

At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver hinted that she would be interested in returning to the role of Ripley, saying: &quot;Had we done a fifth one, I don&#x27;t doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story.&quot; She was quoted: &quot;I don&#x27;t think &quot;Alien&quot; belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in the far reaches of the universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to.&quot;

In 2017, 20th Century Fox was rumored to be reassessing the state of the franchise after the lukewarm reception to &quot;Covenant&quot;, although they have not released an official statement to that effect. According to Collider.com, there will be only one additional prequel film before a soft-reboot is made to the &quot;Alien&quot; universe consisting of a new series of &quot;Alien&quot; films with brand-new, original characters as well as a new setting. At the 2019 CinemaCon, following The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, it was officially confirmed that future &quot;Alien&quot; films were currently in development. Fede Álvarez would be writing and directing the film, which was now titled &quot;&quot;. The film, which is set between &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), was released on August 16, 2024.

<text>Alien 3 (stylized as ALIEN3) is a 1992 American science fiction horror film directed by David Fincher and written by David Giler, Walter Hill, and Larry Ferguson, from a story by Vincent Ward. Starring Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as Ellen Ripley, it is the third installment of the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise.

Set immediately after the events of &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), Ripley and an Alien organism are the only survivors of the Colonial Marine spaceship &quot;Sulaco&quot; following an escape pod&#x27;s crash on a planet housing a penal colony populated by violent male inmates. Additional roles are played by Charles Dance, Brian Glover, Charles S. Dutton, Ralph Brown, Paul McGann, Danny Webb, Lance Henriksen, Holt McCallany, Pete Postlethwaite, and Danielle Edmond. The film had a troubled production, facing numerous problems, including shooting without a script and the attachment of various screenwriters and directors. Fincher, in his feature directorial debut, was eventually brought in to direct after a proposed version with Ward as director was canceled during pre-production.

&quot;Alien 3&quot; was released on May 22, 1992. While it underperformed at the American box office, it earned over $100 million outside North America. The film received mixed reviews and was regarded as inferior to previous installments. Fincher has since disowned the film, deeming it unfaithful to his original vision due to studio interference. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, seven Saturn Awards (Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress for Weaver, Best Supporting Actor for Dutton, Best Direction for Fincher, and Best Writing for Giler, Hill, and Ferguson), a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and an MTV Movie Award for Best Action Sequence. A sequel, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, followed in 1997. In 2003, an extended and revised version of the film known as the Assembly Cut was released without Fincher&#x27;s involvement, which received a warmer reception.

==Plot==

Following the events of &quot;Aliens&quot;, an egg hatches aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship &quot;Sulaco&quot;, releasing a facehugger. A fire starts and the ship&#x27;s computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop; all four are in cryonic stasis. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina &quot;Fury&quot; 161, a foundry and maximum-security correctional facility inhabited by male inmates with a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior. The inmates recover the crashed pod and its passengers. The facehugger approaches inmate Thomas Murphy&#x27;s dog, Spike.
Ripley is awakened by Clemens, the prison&#x27;s chief medical officer, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. The prison warden, Harold Andrews, says that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt and that her and Hicks&#x27;s bodies be subsequently burned, fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The funeral proceeds with spiritual leader Dillon delivering a speech as the deceased are dropped into the furnace. Elsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike.

Ripley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison&#x27;s garbage dump before being cornered by four inmates and almost gang-raped. After being saved by Dillon, Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who, before asking to be permanently shut down, confirms that a Facehugger came with them to Fiorina, under knowledge of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains. It also returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state. Ripley informs Andrews of her previous Xenomorph encounters and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. However, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by Weyland-Yutani.

The Alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison infirmary, killing him, and cornering her. However, it mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the Alien. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates die. With Aaron&#x27;s help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod&#x27;s medical equipment and sees the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. Upon this discovery, she realizes that Weyland-Yutani plans on capturing the alien incubating inside of her in hopes of turning it into biological weapons.

The Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she was carrying, so Ripley begs Dillon to do it; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the Alien first. They form a plan to lure the Alien into the foundry&#x27;s molding facility, trap it, and drown it in molten lead. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of every remaining prisoner but Dillon and Morse. Dillon sacrifices himself to position the Alien towards the mold as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the Alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold. Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, blowing the Alien apart from thermal shock.

The Weyland–Yutani team arrives, including commandos and a man who looks identical to Bishop who says he is Bishop&#x27;s creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Alien Queen embryo, claiming it will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland–Yutani team shoots Morse in the leg to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-alike with a wrench and is shot dead by the commandos. Ignoring pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace, holding captive the infant queen as it erupts from her. The facilities are closed down. Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley&#x27;s final logbook recording from the &quot;Nostromo&quot; plays.

==Cast==
* Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, reprising her role from the previous two &quot;Alien&quot; films. Ripley crash-lands on Fiorina 161 and is once again burdened with the task of destroying another of the alien creatures. Weaver approved of David Twohy&#x27;s script and signed on, but demanded a larger salary of $4–5 million, plus co-producing credit. She also requested for the action not to rely on guns.
* Charles S. Dutton as Leonard Dillon, one of Fiorina&#x27;s inmates who functions as the spiritual and de facto leader amongst the prisoners and attempts to keep the peace in the facility.
* Charles Dance as Jonathan Clemens, a former inmate who now serves as the facility&#x27;s doctor. He treats Ripley after her escape pod crashes at the start of the film and forms a special bond with her. Before he is killed by the Alien, Clemens laments to Ripley why he was originally sent to Fiorina, describing it as &quot;more than a little melodramatic.&quot; Fincher initially offered the role to Richard E. Grant, hoping to reunite him with &quot;Withnail and I&quot; co-stars Ralph Brown and Paul McGann.
* Brian Glover as Harold Andrews, the prison warden. He believes Ripley&#x27;s presence will cause disruption amongst the inmates and attempts to control the rumors surrounding her and the creature. He rejects her claims about the existence of such a creature, only to be killed by it.
* Ralph Brown as Francis Aaron, the assistant of Superintendent Andrews. The prisoners refer to him by the nickname &quot;85&quot;, after his IQ score, which annoys him. He opposes Ripley&#x27;s insistence that the prisoners must try to fight the Alien, and repudiates her claim that Weyland–Yutani will collect the alien instead of them.
* Paul McGann as Walter Golic. A mass-murderer and outcast amongst the prison population, Golic becomes very disturbed after being assaulted by the Alien in the prison&#x27;s underground network of tunnels, gradually becoming more and more obsessed with the Alien. In the Assembly Cut of the film, his obsession with and defense of the creature lead to murder and his own demise, and his actions jeopardize the entire plan.
* Danny Webb as Robert Morse, an acerbic, self-centered, and cynical prisoner. Albeit wounded by the Weyland–Yutani team, Morse is the only survivor from the entire Fiorina 161 population (including Ripley).
* Lance Henriksen as the voice of the damaged Bishop android, as well as playing a character credited as Bishop II, who appears in the film&#x27;s final scenes, claiming to be the human designer of the android, who wants the Alien Queen that was growing inside Ripley for use in Weyland-Yutani&#x27;s bioweapons division. The character is identified as &quot;Michael Bishop Weyland&quot; in certain tie-in materials.
* Tom Woodruff Jr. as the Alien known as &quot;Dragon&quot;. This Alien is different from the ones in previous installments due to its host being quadrupedal (a dog in the theatrical cut, an ox in the assembly cut). Initially a visual effects supervisor, Woodruff decided to take the role of the creature after his company, Amalgamated Dynamics, was hired by Fox. Woodruff said that, following Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s advice, he approaches the role as an actor instead of a stuntman, trying to make his performance more than &quot;just a guy in a suit.&quot; He considered the acting process &quot;as much physical as it is mental.&quot;
* Pete Postlethwaite as David Postlethwaite, an inmate smarter than most who is killed by the Alien in the bait-and-chase sequence.
* Holt McCallany as Junior, the leader of the group of inmates who attempt to rape Ripley. He has a tattoo of a tear drop underneath his right eye. In the Assembly Cut, he sacrifices himself to trap the Alien as redemption.
* Peter Guinness as Peter Gregor, one of the inmates who attempts to rape Ripley; he is bitten in the neck and killed by the Alien during the bait-and-chase sequence.
* Danielle Edmond as Rebecca &quot;Newt&quot; Jordan, the child Ripley forms a maternal bond with in the previous film who briefly returns as a corpse being autopsied. Carrie Henn was unable to reprise her role as Newt as she was too old for the part so Danielle Edmond took over the role in this installment for the brief autopsy scene with Newt&#x27;s corpse.
* Christopher Fairbank as Thomas Murphy.
* Phil Davis as Kevin Dodd.
* Vincenzo Nicoli as Alan Jude.
* Leon Herbert as Edward Boggs.
* Niall Buggy as Eric Buggy.
* Hi Ching as Company Man.
* Carl Chase as Frank Ellis.
* Clive Mantle as Clive William.
* DeObia Oparei as Arthur Walkingstick.
* Paul Brennen as Yoshi Troy.

An archive picture of Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks appears.

==Production==

===Development===
With the success of &quot;Aliens&quot;, 20th Century Fox approached Brandywine Productions on further sequels. But Brandywine was less than enthused with an &quot;Alien 3&quot; project, with producer David Giler later explaining he and partners Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll wanted to take new directions as &quot;we wouldn&#x27;t do a repeat of one and two&quot;. The trio opted to explore the duplicity of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, and why they were so intent in using the Aliens as biological weapons. Various concepts were discussed, eventually settling on a two-part story, with the treatment for the third film featuring &quot;the underhanded Weyland–Yutani Corporation facing off with a militarily aggressive culture of humans whose rigid socialist ideology has caused them to separate from Earth&#x27;s society.&quot; Michael Biehn&#x27;s Corporal Hicks would be promoted to protagonist in the third film, with Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s character of Ellen Ripley reduced to a cameo appearance before returning in the fourth installment, &quot;an epic battle with alien warriors mass-produced by the expatriated Earthlings.&quot; Weaver liked the Cold War metaphor, and agreed to a smaller role, particularly due to a dissatisfaction with Fox, which removed scenes from &quot;Aliens&quot; crucial to Ripley&#x27;s backstory.
Although Fox was skeptical about the idea, they agreed to finance the development of the story, but asked that Hill and Giler attempt to get Ridley Scott, director of &quot;Alien&quot;, to make &quot;Alien 3&quot;. They also asked that the two films be shot back to back to lessen the production costs. While Scott was interested in returning to the franchise, it did not work out due to the director&#x27;s busy schedule.

===William Gibson script===
In September 1987, Giler and Hill approached cyberpunk author William Gibson to write the script for the third film. Gibson, who told the producers his writing was influenced by &quot;Alien&quot;, accepted the task. Fearful of an impending strike by the Writers Guild of America, Brandywine asked Gibson to deliver a screenplay by December. Gibson drew heavily from Giler and Hill&#x27;s treatment, having a strong interest in the &quot;Marxist space empire&quot; element. The following year, Finnish director Renny Harlin was approached by Fox based on his work in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;. Harlin wanted to go in different directions from the first two movies, having interest in both visiting the Alien homeworld or having the Aliens invading Earth.

Gibson mockingly summed up his script as &quot;Space commies hijack alien eggs—big problem in Mallworld&quot;. The story picked up after &quot;Aliens&quot;, with the &quot;Sulaco&quot; drifting into an area of space claimed by the &quot;Union of Progressive Peoples&quot;. The ship is boarded by people from the UPP, who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop&#x27;s mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The &quot;Sulaco&quot; then arrives at a space station–shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint. With Ripley put in a coma, Hicks explores the station and discovers Weyland-Yutani are developing an Alien army. In the meantime, the UPP are doing their own research, which led them to repair Bishop. Eventually Anchorpoint and the UPP stations are overrun with the Aliens, and Hicks must team up with the survivors to destroy the parasites. The film ends with a teaser for a fourth movie, where Bishop suggests to Hicks that humans are united against a common enemy, and they must track the Aliens to their source and destroy them.

The screenplay was very action-oriented, featuring an extended cast, and is considered in some circles as superior to the final film and has a considerable following on the Internet. The producers were on the whole unsatisfied with the screenplay, which Giler described as &quot;a perfectly executed script that wasn&#x27;t all that interesting&quot;, particularly for not taking new directions with the initial pitch. They still liked certain parts, such as the subtext making the Alien a metaphor for HIV, but felt it lacking the human element present in &quot;Aliens&quot; and Gibson&#x27;s trademark cyberpunk aesthetic. Following the end of the WGA strike, Gibson was asked to make rewrites with Harlin, but declined, citing various other commitments and &quot;foot dragging on the producers&#x27; part.&quot; On July 12, 2018, it was announced that William Gibson&#x27;s unmade screenplay of &quot;Alien 3&quot; would be adapted into a comic series. As part of &quot;Alien&quot;″s 40th anniversary, on May 30, 2019, a full-cast audio drama of William Gibson&#x27;s unproduced screenplay of &quot;Alien 3&quot; was released and made available on Audible, with both Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen reprising their film-roles. Both are based on the second draft. 2021 saw another adaptation of the screenplay, this time as a novel written by Pat Cadigan from Titan Books and based instead on the first draft.

===Eric Red script===
Following Gibson&#x27;s departure, Harlin suggested screenwriter Eric Red, writer of the cult horror films &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and &quot;Near Dark&quot;. Red worked less than two months to deliver his draft in February 1989, which led him to later describe his &quot;Alien 3&quot; work as &quot;the one script I completely disown because it was not &#x27;my script&#x27;. It was the rushed product of too many story conferences and interference with no time to write, and turned out utter crap.&quot; His approach had a completely new set of characters and subplots, while also introducing new breeds of the Alien. The plot opened with a team of Special Forces marines boarding the &quot;Sulaco&quot; and finding that all survivors had fallen victim to the aliens. Afterwards, it moved into a small-town U.S. city in a type of bio-dome in space, culminating in an all-out battle with the townsfolk facing hordes of Alien warriors. Brandywine rejected Red&#x27;s script for deviating too much from their story, and eventually gave up on developing two sequels simultaneously.

===David Twohy script===
Writer David Twohy was next to work on the project, being instructed to start with Gibson&#x27;s script. Once the fall of Communism made the Cold War analogies outdated, Twohy changed his setting to a prison planet, which was being used for illegal experiments on the aliens for biological warfare. Harlin felt this approach was too similar to the previous movies, and, tired of the development hell, walked out on the project, which led Fox to offer Harlin &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;.

Twohy&#x27;s script was delivered to Fox president Joe Roth, who did not like the idea of Ripley being removed, declaring that &quot;Sigourney Weaver is the centerpiece of the series&quot; and Ripley was &quot;really the only female warrior we have in our movie mythology.&quot; Weaver was then called, with a reported $4 million salary, plus a share of the box office receipts. She also requested the story to be suitably impressive, original, and non-dependent on guns. Twohy duly set about writing Ripley into his screenplay.

===Start-up with Vincent Ward===
Once Hill attended a screening of &quot;The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey&quot;, he decided to invite its director, Vincent Ward. Ward, who was in London developing &quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot;, accepted the project only on the third call, as he at first was uninterested in doing a sequel. Ward thought little of the Twohy script, and instead worked up another idea, involving Ripley&#x27;s escape pod crash landing on a monastery-like satellite. Having developed this pitch on his flight to Los Angeles, once Ward got with the studio executives he saw his idea approved by the studio. Ward was hired to direct &quot;Alien 3&quot;, and writer John Fasano was hired to expand his story into a screenplay. Once Twohy discovered through a journalist friend that another script was being written concurrently with his, he went after Fox and eventually left the project.

Ward envisioned a planet whose interior was both wooden and archaic in design, where Luddite-like monks would take refuge. The story begins with a monk who sees a &quot;star in the East&quot; (Ripley&#x27;s escape pod) and at first believes this to be a good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it to be some sort of religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the monks of the &quot;wooden satellite&quot; lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast. The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley&#x27;s own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternative ending in which Ripley survived, but Weaver would agree to the film only if Ripley died.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine described Ward&#x27;s &#x27;Wooden Planet&#x27; concept as &#x27;undeniably attractive—it would have been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.&#x27; In the same article, Norman Reynolds—the production designer originally hired by Ward—remembers an early design idea for &quot;a wooden library shaft. You looked at the books on this wooden platform that went up and down&quot;. &#x27;Imagine the kind of vertical jeopardy sequence that could have been staged here—the Alien clambering up these impossibly high bookshelves as desperate monks work the platform&#x27;. Sigourney Weaver described Ward&#x27;s overall concept as &quot;very original and arresting.&quot; Former &quot;Times&quot; journalist David Hughes included Ward&#x27;s version of &quot;Alien 3&quot; amongst &quot;The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made&quot; in his book of this title.

However, the concept was divisive among the production crew. The producers at Brandywine discussed the logical problems of creating and maintaining a wooden planet in space, while Fox executive Jon Landau considered Ward&#x27;s vision to be &quot;more on the artsy-fartsy side than on the big commercial side&quot; that Ridley Scott and James Cameron employed. Ward managed to dissuade the producers of their idea of turning the planet into an ore refinery and the monks into prisoners, but eventually Fox asked for a meeting with the director imposing a list of changes to be made. Refusing to do so, Ward was fired. The main plot of the finished film still follows Ward&#x27;s basic structure.

===Walter Hill and David Giler&#x27;s script===
Hill and Giler did a first draft trying to enhance the story structure on the Fasano script, and feeling creatively drained, hired Larry Ferguson as a script doctor. Ferguson&#x27;s work was not well received in the production, particularly by Sigourney Weaver, who felt Ferguson made Ripley sound like &quot;a pissed-off gym teacher&quot;. Short on time before filming was due to commence, Hill and Giler took control of the screenplay themselves, melding aspects of the Ward/Fasano script with Twohy&#x27;s earlier prison planet screenplay to create the basis of the final film. Sigourney Weaver had also had a clause written into her contract stating the final draft should be written by Hill and Giler, believing that they were the only writers (besides James Cameron) to write the character of Ripley effectively. Fox approached music video director David Fincher to replace Ward. Fincher did further work on the screenplay with author Rex Pickett, and despite Pickett being fired and Hill and Giler writing the final draft of the screenplay, he revised most of the work done by the previous authors. Fincher wanted Gary Oldman to star in the film, but the pair &quot;couldn&#x27;t work it out&quot;.

===Filming===

Filming began on January 14, 1991, at Pinewood Studios without a finished script and with $7 million already having been spent. While a majority of the film was shot at Pinewood, some scenes were shot at Blyth Power Station and the beach near Dawdon (known locally as &quot;the Blast&quot; or &quot;Blast Beach&quot;) in the UK. The purpose of these shots was to show the exterior of the planet. Cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, in deteriorating health following a diagnosis of Parkinsons Disease a decade earlier worked only for two weeks before becoming too ill to continue. He was replaced by Alex Thomson. Actor Charles Dance said that an alternative ending had been filmed due to fears that the original ending was too similar to the ending of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, released the previous year, but was not used.

===Visual effects===
Stan Winston, responsible for creature effects in &quot;Aliens&quot;, was approached but was not available. Winston instead recommended Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two former workers of his studio who had just started their own company, Amalgamated Dynamics. Even before principal photography had begun, the practical effects crew was developing models of the Alien and the corpses of the &quot;Sulaco&quot; victims. Richard Edlund&#x27;s Boss Film Studios was hired for compositing and other post-production effects. A small number of shots contain computer-generated imagery, most notably the cracking alien head once the sprinklers cause thermal shock. Other CGI elements include shadows cast by the rod puppet alien, and airborne debris in outdoor scenes.

David Fincher wanted the alien to be, &quot;more of a puma, or a beast&quot; as opposed to the upright, humanoid posture of the previous films, so the designer of the original alien, H. R. Giger, was contacted to generate new sketch ideas. His revisions included longer, thinner legs, the removal of &quot;pipes&quot; around the spine, and an idea for a sharp alien &quot;tongue&quot; in place of the secondary jaws. Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of plasticine. The only one of Giger&#x27;s designs that wound up in the final project was a &quot;Bambi Burster&quot; Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale Bunraku-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the background plate, but can be seen in the &quot;Assembly Cut&quot; of the film.

The Alien is portrayed by both Woodruff Jr. in a suit and a rod puppet filmed against bluescreen and optically composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in &quot;Aliens&quot; so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff&#x27;s head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.

The rod-puppet approach was chosen for the production rather than stop-motion animation, which did not provide the required smoothness to appear realistic. As a result, the rod-puppet allowed for a fast alien that could move across surfaces of any orientation and be shot from any angle. This was particularly effective as it was able to accomplish movements not feasible by an actor in a suit. The -scale puppet was 40 inches long and cast in foam rubber over a bicycle chain armature for flexibility. For moving camera shots, the on-set cameras were equipped with digital recorders to track, pan, tilt, and dolly values. The data output was then taken back to the studio and fed into the motion control cameras with the linear dimensions scaled down to match the puppet.

To make syncing the puppet&#x27;s actions with the live-action shots easier, the effects team developed an instant compositing system using LaserDisc. This allowed takes to be quickly overlaid on the background plate so the crew could observe whether any spatial adjustments were required.

Laine Liska was hired to lead a team of puppeteers in a new process dubbed &quot;Mo-Motion&quot; where the rod puppet would be simultaneously manipulated and filmed with a moving motion control camera. Depending on the complexity of the shot, the puppet was operated by 4–6 people. Sparse sets were created to provide freedom of motion for the puppeteers as well as large, solid surfaces for the puppet to act within a three dimensional space.

The crew was pushed to make the movements of the Alien as quick as possible to the point where they were barely in control, and this led to, according to Edlund, &quot;the occasional serendipitous action that made the alien have a character.&quot; The ease of this setup allowed the crew to film 60–70 takes of a single scene.

Hoping to give the destroyed Bishop a more complex look that could not be accomplished by simple make-up, the final product was done entirely through animatronics, while a playback of Lance Henriksen&#x27;s voice played to guide Sigourney Weaver.

Scenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle were shot with a 3.5-foot miniature against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional matte paintings of the planet&#x27;s surface. To make the clouds glow from within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting&#x27;s values were digitally reversed and animated frame by frame. The scene in which the EEV is moved by a crane-arm (also a miniature) was created by projecting a video of actors onto pieces of cardboard and then compositing them into the scene as silhouettes against the matte-painted background.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s composer, Elliot Goldenthal, spent a year composing the score by working closely with Fincher to create music based primarily on the surroundings and atmosphere of the film itself. The score was recorded during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which Goldenthal later claimed contributed to the score&#x27;s disturbing nature.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Alien 3&quot; has been released in various home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these were on VHS and LaserDisc, and several subsequent VHS releases were sold both singly and as boxed sets throughout the 1990s. A VHS boxed set titled &quot;The Alien Trilogy&quot; containing &quot;Alien 3&quot; along with &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; was released in facehugger-shaped carrying cases, and included some of the deleted scenes from the LaserDisc editions. In 1997, &quot;Alien 3&quot; would premiere on a THX certified widescreen VHS release, along with its predecessors. When &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; premiered in theaters that year, another boxed set of the first three films was released titled &quot;The Alien Saga&quot;, which included a &quot;Making of Alien Resurrection&quot; tape. A few months later, this set was re-released with the &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; film taking the place of the making-of video. In 1999, &quot;Alien 3&quot; was released on DVD, both singly and packaged with the other three &quot;Alien&quot; films as &quot;The Alien Legacy&quot; boxed set. This set was also released in a VHS version and would be the last VHS release of the film. In 2003, &quot;Alien 3&quot; would be included in the 9-disc &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; DVD set which contained two versions of the film (see below). The first three films were also later packaged as the &quot;Alien Triple Pack&quot; DVD set (this release was identical to the 1999 &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set but excluding &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;). &quot;Alien 3&quot; was first released on Blu-ray in 2010, as part of the 6-disc &quot;Alien Anthology&quot; boxed set which included all of the features from the &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; DVD set and more. The film was also released as a single Blu-ray Disc in 2011. Fincher was the only director from the franchise who declined to participate in the box-set releases.

The bonus disc for &quot;Alien 3&quot; in the 2003 &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; set includes a documentary of the film&#x27;s production that lacks Fincher&#x27;s participation, as clips where the director openly expresses anger and frustration with the studio were cut. The documentary was originally named &quot;Wreckage and Rape&quot; after one of the tracks of Goldenthal&#x27;s soundtrack, but Fox renamed it simply &quot;The Making of Alien 3&quot;. These clips were restored for the 2010 Blu-ray release of the &quot;Anthology&quot; set, with the integral documentary having a slightly altered version of the intended name, &quot;Wreckage and Rage&quot;.

===Assembly Cut===
When Fox wanted to assemble a director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Alien 3&quot; for a home-video release, Fincher refused to participate. Instead, an extended cut called the &quot;Assembly Cut&quot; was created based on his editing room notes and released on the 2003 &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; box set, overseen by producer Charles de Lauzirika. This version of the film runs 144 minutes, and includes over 30 minutes of extended, alternate, and previously deleted scenes, as well as alternative key plot elements. One example of the plot differences is that in the theatrical version, the Alien bursts out of a dog, while in the Assembly Cut the Alien bursts out of a dead ox. Another example is that in the theatrical version, Ripley and the inmates fail to trap the Alien in the toxic waste room, while in the Assembly Cut they succeed. Golic, the crazed prisoner who becomes fascinated with the Alien, then escapes from the infirmary, kills the prisoner standing guard, and lets the Alien loose at the expense of his own life. This fills the plot hole that was Golic&#x27;s fate, as in the theatrical version he simply disappears from the film after Clemens&#x27;s death in the infirmary. In addition to Golic, more of the minor characters&#x27; fates are revealed, filling more plot holes.

Unlike the 2003 DVD release, in the 2010 Blu-ray version the additional footage went through post-production, receiving color correction and sound mixing to match the rest of the film, which included bringing back some cast members to re-record dialogue.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Alien 3&quot; was released in the United States on May 22, 1992. The film debuted at number two of the box office, behind &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, with a Memorial Day weekend gross of $23.1 million. It screened in 2,227 theaters, for an average gross of $8,733 per theater. The film was considered a disappointment in the United States and Canada with a total of $55.5 million, although, according to Box Office Mojo, it grossed $104.3 million internationally for a total of $159.8 million. It outgrossed the original theatrical run of &quot;Alien&quot;, and had the 28th-highest domestic gross in 1992. In October 1992, Fox claimed it was the highest-grossing of the franchise, with a worldwide gross of $175 million. By the end of 1992, &quot;Variety&quot; reported its worldwide gross at $180  million.

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Alien 3&quot; an approval rating of 44% from 125 reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Alien3&quot; takes admirable risks with franchise mythology, but far too few pay off in a thinly scripted sequel whose stylish visuals aren&#x27;t enough to enliven a lack of genuine thrills.&quot; Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 20 critics, signifying &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film two thumbs down on their show &quot;At The Movies,&quot; feeling it was repetitious. They criticized the drawn-out chase scenes near the end as well as the lack of suspenseful action, though they praised the art direction and Weaver&#x27;s performance, with Ebert calling it &quot;probably the best-looking bad movie I&#x27;ve seen in a while&quot;. In his review of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, Ebert later wrote &quot;I lost interest [in &quot;Alien 3&quot;], when I realized that the aliens could at all times outrun and outleap the humans, so all the chase scenes were contrivances.&quot;

A number of cast and crew associated with the series, including actor Michael Biehn, director James Cameron, and novelist Alan Dean Foster, expressed their frustration and disappointment with the film&#x27;s story. Cameron regarded the decision to kill off the characters of Bishop, Newt, and Hicks as a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to him and to fans of the previous film. He eventually blamed 20th Century Fox for the film, saying that Fincher got handed &quot;a big mess on a plate&quot;. Upon learning of Hicks&#x27;s demise, Biehn demanded and received almost as much money for the use of his likeness in one scene as he had been paid for his entire role in &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Fincher has since disowned the film. He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009, &quot;No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.&quot; He also blamed the producers for not putting trust in him. While Weaver has stood by the final film and expressed that she &quot;loved working with&quot; Fincher, she heavily criticized the treatment of him by 20th Century Fox, stating; &quot;That was a transition moment when studios stopped being about ‘let’s make great films’ and started being about ‘let’s not lose money.’ They had the great idea to put David Fincher aboard for his first film, but then not to support the guy was very idiotic.&quot; Charles Dance also stood by the film, considering it better than its predecessor, and also praised Fincher’s direction: &quot;I remember walking on this huge set at Pinewood Studios and Fincher comes up and fires off his shot list for the day. Here’s this guy young enough to be my son who knew all the crew’s jobs, all the shots he wanted, and where he was going to make the cuts in the film, and I thought, ‘My God, this guy is going to go far.&#x27;&quot;

Several critics have regarded the Assembly Cut as superior to the theatrical release. Journalist Nick Schager called it a &quot;fascinating, often fantastic&quot; film, its additional scenes a &quot;disdainful critique of religion&quot;. Critic Tim Brayton remarked it &quot;feels much fleeter and more driven even though it&#x27;s a solid 30 minutes longer&quot;.

===Accolades===

The film&#x27;s visual effects were nominated for an Academy Award, losing to &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;, and for a BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects. The film was also nominated for seven Saturn Awards, a Hugo Award and won a MTV Movie Award for Best Action Sequence.

==Other media==

===Novelization===
A novelization of the film was authored by Alan Dean Foster, writer of the novelizations of &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;. Foster&#x27;s adaptation includes many scenes that were cut from the final film, some of which later reappeared in the &quot;Assembly Cut&quot;. Foster wanted his adaptation to differ from the film&#x27;s script, which he disliked, but Walter Hill declared he should not alter the storyline. Foster later commented: &quot;So out went my carefully constructed motivations for all the principal prisoners, my preserving the life of Newt (her killing in the film is an obscenity), and much else. Embittered by this experience, that&#x27;s why I turned down &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;.&quot;

===Comic books===
Dark Horse Comics also released a three-issue mini series. Created by writer Steven Grant and artist Christopher Taylor, the comic was a faithful adaption, with only a few deviations. One such deviation is that Ripley and the convicts succeed in capturing the Xenomorph in the waste-tank, only for a deranged prisoner named Golic to release it afterward. Later, when they believe they have destroyed the Alien, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her, but he can&#x27;t bring himself to do it. The Xenomorph suddenly appears, and tosses Dillon into the smelting furnace.

===Video games===
A video game of the same name was developed by Probe Entertainment, and released for multiple formats by Acclaim, LJN and Virgin Games, including Amiga, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES, Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System. Rather than being a faithful adaptation of the film, it took the form of a basic platform action game where the player controlled Ripley using the weapons from the film &quot;Aliens&quot; in a green-dark ambient environment. The Game Boy version, developed by Bits Studios, was different from the console game, being a top-down adventure game. Sega also developed an arcade rail shooter loosely based on the film&#x27;s events, &quot;Alien 3: The Gun&quot;, which was released in 1993.

===Television===
An animated series titled &quot;Operation: Aliens&quot; was conceived by Kenner Toys and Fox to coincide with the release of &quot;Alien 3&quot; but was ultimately abandoned. Animation on the series was to be carried out by the Korean animation studio AKOM, but the series was scrapped for fears it would run afoul of the Children&#x27;s Television Act and because Fox, intending to produce further &quot;Alien&quot; films, was concerned an animated series for children would dilute the franchise&#x27;s appeal to the older demographic.

=== William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Alien 3&quot; ===
In 2018–19, Dark Horse released &quot;William Gibson&#x27;s Alien 3&quot;, a five-part comic adaptation of Gibson&#x27;s unproduced version of the screenplay, illustrated and adapted by Johnnie Christmas, colored by Tamra Bonvillain.

As part of &quot;Alien&quot;″s 40th anniversary, on May 30, 2019, Audible released an audio drama of Gibson&#x27;s script, adapted by Dirk Maggs, and with Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen reprising their roles. The production had music by James Hannigan.

In 2021, Pat Cadigan published &quot;Alien³: The Unproduced First-draft Screenplay by William Gibson&quot; (Titan Books). This novel is based on Gibson&#x27;s first draft, as opposed to the second draft used for the comic and audio drama adaptations. The novel won the Scribe Award for Best Adapted Novel.

<text>Gary Christopher Fisher (born November 5, 1950) is considered one of the inventors of the modern mountain bike.

Fisher started competing in road and track races at age 12. He was suspended in 1968 because race organizers cited a rule that his hair was too long. By 1972 this rule had been repealed and Fisher&#x27;s career continued. He won the TransAlp race in Europe and a Masters XC national title.

Fisher went to work in 1974 on his 1930s Schwinn Excelsior X Bicycle. His innovations to the model included drum brakes, motorcycle brake levers and cables, and triple chain–rings, all taken from &quot;junkers&quot; Fisher found at bike shops. The next year, Fisher participated in the Repack downhill race, promoted by his roommate Charlie Kelly. This used a tortuous downhill route on Pine Mountain near Fairfax, California, just north of San Francisco, in which riders used their coaster brakes so much that they had to repack the smoking hubs with grease after every run. Fisher holds the record time on the Repack course at 4:22.

Gary Fisher speaks about his role as a pioneer in the sport of mountain biking in two video documentaries: &quot;Full Cycle: A World Odyssey&quot; (1994) and &quot;&quot; (2007). Original clips of Fisher on his mountain bike appear in both documentaries.

==Company==
Gary Fisher coined the term &quot;mountain bike&quot; in 1979. That year, Fisher and Kelly founded MountainBikes, the first company to specialize in the manufacture of this type of bicycle. Frames were built by Tom Ritchey, who later founded his own company. The first model sold for $1,300; 160 were manufactured in the first year.

1979 saw the introduction of Shimano components and an ill-fated attempt to trademark &quot;Mountain Bike&quot;. The company dissolved in 1983; Fisher founded Gary Fisher Mountain Bikes the same year. Fisher sold his company in 1991 to Taiwan&#x27;s Anlen company, staying on as President. Fisher developed the first commercially produced full suspension bicycles designed by Mert Lawwill, a former champion motorcycle racer. His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the A-arm suspension design from sports car racing, and was the first four-bar linkage in mountain biking.
In 1992, Howie Cohen, who had previously imported Nishiki, Azuki and Kuwahara bicycles, assisted Gary Fisher with his brand, 18 months later brokering the acquisition of Fisher by Trek Bicycle Corporation.

On June 16, 2010, Trek Bicycle Corporation announced &quot;the Gary Fisher Collection, a line of Trek bikes that will replace the standalone Gary Fisher brand&quot;.

== After company sale ==
Fisher remains involved with design and marketing, along with being scout and mentor to racers sponsored by the team. The best known was the gold-medal winner in the 1996 and 2000 Olympics women&#x27;s mountain biking: Paola Pezzo.

== Awards ==

Fisher was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1988. &quot;Outside&quot; magazine named him one of the &quot;50 who left their mark&quot; in the sport in 2000, and &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine honored him in 1994 as the &quot;Founding Father of Mountain Bikes.&quot; In 1998, Fisher was recognized by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; for his innovations in sports.

<text>Robert Lee Zemeckis (born May 14, 1952) is an American filmmaker known for directing and producing a range of successful and influential movies, often blending cutting-edge visual effects with storytelling. He has received several accolades including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for five British Academy Film Awards and a Daytime Emmy Award.

Zemeckis started his career directing the comedy films &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; (1978), &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984). He gained prominence directing the science-fiction comedy &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy (1985–1990), the fantasy comedy &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), and the comedy-drama &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), the latter of which won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director.

He has also directed the satirical black comedy &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), the science fiction film &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), and the drama films &quot;Cast Away&quot; (2000), &quot;Flight&quot; (2012), &quot;The Walk&quot; (2015), and &quot;Allied&quot; (2016). His exploration of performance capture techniques can be seen in the animated films &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004) and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009) as well as the action fantasy drama &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), and the drama &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot; (2018). He has collaborated with film composer Alan Silvestri since 1984, and directed Tom Hanks in five films.

==Early life and education ==
Robert Lee Zemeckis was born on May 14, 1952, in Chicago, the son of Rosa (née Nespeca) and Alphonse Zemeckis. His father was Lithuanian-American while his mother was Italian-American. His father&#x27;s parents, Kazimieras Žemeckas (1877–1960) and Marijona Dantaitė-Žemeckienė (1887–1945), were born in Lithuania and later emigrated to the United States.

Zemeckis grew up on the South Side of the city in a working class family. He attended a Catholic grade school and Fenger Academy High School. Zemeckis has said &quot;the truth was that in my family there was no art. I mean, there was no music, there were no books, there was no theater ... The only thing I had that was inspirational, was television—and it actually was.&quot;

As a child, he loved television and was fascinated by his parents&#x27; 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV viewer. &quot;You hear so much about the problems with television,&quot; he said, &quot;but I think that it saved my life.&quot; Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

After seeing &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; with his father, Zemeckis decided that he wanted to go to film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, &quot;But only in the sense that they were concerned ... for my family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you see where you come from? You can&#x27;t be a movie director.&#x27; I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too.&quot;

Zemeckis first attended Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, and gained early experience in film as a film cutter for NBC News in Chicago during a summer break. He also edited commercials in his home state. Zemeckis applied to transfer from NIU to the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles, California, and went into the Film School on the strength of an essay and a music video based on a Beatles song. Not having heard from the university itself, Zemeckis called and was told he had been rejected because of his average grades. He gave an &quot;impassioned plea&quot; to the official on the other line, promising to go to summer school and improve his studies, and eventually convinced the school to accept him.

Arriving at USC that fall, Zemeckis encountered a program that was, in his words, made up of &quot;a bunch of hippies [and] considered an embarrassment by the university&quot;. The classes were difficult, with professors constantly stressing how hard the movie business was. Zemeckis remembered not being much fazed by this, citing the &quot;healthy cynicism&quot; that had been bred into him from his Chicago upbringing. At USC Zemeckis met a fellow student, writer Bob Gale. Gale later recalled, &quot;The graduate students at USC had this veneer of intellectualism ... So Bob and I gravitated toward one another because we wanted to make Hollywood movies. We weren&#x27;t interested in the French New Wave. We were interested in Clint Eastwood and James Bond and Walt Disney, because that&#x27;s how we grew up.&quot; Zemeckis graduated from USC in 1973, and he and Gale cowrote the unproduced screenplays &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot;, which they pitched to John Milius, the latter of which was later developed into a film which was released in 1996.

== Career ==
=== 1978–1984: Early comedy films ===
As a result of winning a Student Academy Award at USC for his film &quot;A Field of Honor&quot;, Zemeckis came to the attention of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg said, &quot;He barged right past my secretary and sat me down and showed me this student film ... and I thought it was spectacular, with police cars and a riot, all dubbed to Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.&quot; Spielberg became Zemeckis&#x27;s mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Gale and Zemeckis co-wrote.

Spielberg produced &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; (1978, starring Nancy Allen) and &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980, starring Kurt Russell); both were critical, but not commercial, successes. &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; was the first of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historic figures and celebrities into his movies; he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of the Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed &quot;1941&quot; (1979) (written by Gale and Zemeckis), the pair gained a reputation for writing &quot;scripts that everyone thought were great [but] somehow didn&#x27;t translate into movies people wanted to see.&quot;

As a result of his reputation within the industry, Zemeckis had trouble finding work in the early 1980s, though he and Gale kept busy. They wrote scripts for other directors, including &quot;Car Pool&quot; for Brian De Palma and &quot;Growing Up&quot; for Spielberg; neither ended up getting made. Another Zemeckis-Gale project, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, about a teenager who accidentally travels back in time to the 1950s, was turned down by every major studio. The director was jobless until Michael Douglas hired him in 1984 to direct &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. A romantic adventure starring Douglas and Kathleen Turner, &quot;Stone&quot; was expected to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-in-the-works &quot;Cocoon&quot; fired Zemeckis as director), but the film became a sleeper hit. While working on &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, Zemeckis met composer Alan Silvestri, who has scored all his subsequent pictures.

=== 1985–1999: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

After &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, Zemeckis had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay. Starring Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Christopher Lloyd, the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release and was followed by two sequels, released as &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; in 1990. Before the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, which combined traditional animation and live-action; its $70 million budget made it one of the most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success and won three Academy Awards. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, &quot;I would like to be able to do everything. Just now, though, I&#x27;m too restless to do anything that&#x27;s not really zany.&quot;

In 1992, Zemeckis directed the black comedy &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;, starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, and Bruce Willis. Although his next film would have some comedic elements, it was Zemeckis&#x27;s first with dramatic elements and was also his biggest commercial success to date, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Starring Tom Hanks in the title role, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; tells the story of a man with a low I.Q., who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top-grossing US film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hanks) and Best Director (for Zemeckis). From this point, Hanks and Zemeckis became frequent collaborators. In 1997, Zemeckis directed &quot;Contact&quot;, a long-gestating project based on Carl Sagan&#x27;s 1985 novel of the same name. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrials. In the early 1990s, he founded South Side Amusement Company, which later became ImageMovers.

During this same time period, Zemeckis was an executive producer of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1989–1996) and directed three episodes. In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million towards the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis spoke in a panel about the future of film, alongside friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, &quot;These guys are the same ones who have been saying that LPs sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you&#x27;re blue in the face, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s still buying vinyl. The film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man&#x27;s desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire.&quot; The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the Interactive Media Division, and Trojan Vision, USC&#x27;s student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.
In 1996, Zemeckis had begun developing a project titled &quot;The Castaway&quot; with Tom Hanks and writer William Broyles Jr. The story, inspired by &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, is about a man who becomes stranded on a tropical island and undergoes a profound physical and spiritual change. While working on &quot;The Castaway&quot;, Zemeckis also became attached to a Hitchcockian thriller titled &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, the story of a married couple experiencing an extreme case of empty nest syndrome that was based on an idea by Steven Spielberg. Because Hanks&#x27;s character needed to undergo a dramatic weight loss over the course of &quot;The Castaway&quot; (retitled &quot;Cast Away&quot; for release), Zemeckis decided that the only way to retain the same crew while Hanks lost the weight was to shoot &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; in between. He shot the first part of &quot;Cast Away&quot; in early 1999, and shot &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; in fall 1999, completing work on the former in early 2000. Zemeckis later quipped, when asked about shooting two films back-to-back, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.&quot; &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, was released in July 2000 to mixed reviews, but did well at the box office, grossing over $155 million domestically. &quot;Cast Away&quot;, starring Hanks and &quot;Twister&quot; actress Helen Hunt, was released that December and grossed $233 million domestically; Hanks received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Chuck Noland.

===2004–present: Career fluctuations ===
In 2004, Zemeckis reteamed with Hanks for &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, based on Chris Van Allsburg&#x27;s children&#x27;s book of the same name. &quot;The Polar Express&quot; utilized the computer animation technique known as performance capture, whereby the movements of the actors are captured digitally and used as the basis for the animated characters. As the first major film to use performance capture, &quot;The Polar Express&quot; caused &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write that, &quot;Whatever critics and audiences make of this movie, from a technical perspective it could mark a turning point in the gradual transition from an analog to a digital cinema.&quot; Zemeckis served as an executive producer for &quot;Monster House&quot; (2006), a family-friendly horror comedy that used performance capture.
In February 2007, Zemeckis and Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook announced plans for a new performance capture film company devoted to CG-created, 3-D movies. The company, ImageMovers Digital, created films using the performance capture technology, with Zemeckis directing most of the projects which Disney distributed and marketed worldwide. Zemeckis used the performance capture technology again in his film, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, to retell the Anglo-Saxon epic poem of the same name. It featured Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie, and Anthony Hopkins. Neil Gaiman, who co-wrote the adaptation with Roger Avary, described the film as a &quot;cheerfully violent and strange take on the Beowulf legend.&quot; The film was released on November 16, 2007, to mostly positive reviews and grossed $196 million worldwide. In July 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Zemeckis had written a screenplay for &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 short story of the same name, with plans to use performance capture and release it under the aegis of ImageMovers Digital. Zemeckis wrote the script with Jim Carrey in mind, and Carrey agreed to play a multitude of roles in the film, including Ebenezer Scrooge as a young, middle-aged, and old man, and the three ghosts who haunt Scrooge. The film began production in February 2008 and was released on November 6, 2009, to mixed reviews and grossed $325 million at the box office. Actor Gary Oldman also appeared in the film. Zemeckis is an avid supporter of 3-D Digital Cinema and has stated that since the 3-D presentations of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, all of his future films would be done in 3-D using digital motion capture. He has reportedly backed away from that statement and said that the decision to use 3-D will be on a film-by-film basis.

On August 19, 2009, it was reported that Zemeckis and his company were in talks with Apple Corps Ltd to remake the animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; utilizing performance capture. However, on March 12, 2010, with Zemeckis&#x27;s biggest Disney ally, former chairman Dick Cook, gone, and amid drastic cost-cutting by the new management team, Disney announced that it was ending its relationship with ImageMovers Digital. The studio&#x27;s final film, 2011&#x27;s Zemeckis-produced &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot;, was the second-worst box office failure in history, with a net loss of roughly $130 million. Zemeckis made his return to live-action filmmaking with &quot;Flight&quot;, a 2012 drama for Paramount, starring Denzel Washington. On January 31, 2014, it was announced that a stage musical adaptation of Zemeckis&#x27;s first &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film was in production. The show would be co-written by original writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. According to Gale, the musical would be &quot;true to the spirit of the film without being a slavish remake&quot;.
In August 2008, &quot;IGN&quot; revealed in an interview with Philippe Petit that Zemeckis was working with Petit to turn Petit&#x27;s memoir &quot;To Reach the Clouds&quot; into a feature film. In 2015, he directed &quot;The Walk&quot;, about Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his ambition to tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center. Paramount Pictures and New Regency announced in February 2015 that Zemeckis would direct Brad Pitt in &quot;Allied&quot;, a romantic thriller set during World War II. The film was released on November 23, 2016. Next, Zemeckis directed the fantasy drama &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot;, starring Steve Carell, which was released in December 2018 to mixed reviews and flopped at the box office. Zemeckis&#x27;s film &quot;The Witches&quot;, an adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel of the same name, premiered on October 22, 2020, on HBO Max, also to mixed reviews.

On October 18, 2019, it was announced that Zemeckis is in talks to direct Disney&#x27;s live-action adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Zemeckis was officially announced as the film&#x27;s director and co-writer of the script in January 2020. In addition, Tom Hanks was reportedly announced as playing Mister Geppetto in the film, marking the fourth collaboration with Hanks since &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Cast Away&quot;, and &quot;The Polar Express&quot;. The film was later released, as part of Disney+ Day on Disney+, on September 8, 2022, to highly negative reviews from critics, nominated for six Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Director for Zemeckis (&quot;winning&quot; Worst Remake), ultimately losing the former to &quot;Blonde&quot;. Despite this, it also received a Visual Effects Society Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Feature.

On February 17, 2022, Zemeckis signed on to direct &quot;Here&quot;, an adaptation of the graphic novel by Richard McGuire, with Tom Hanks set to star and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; screenwriter Eric Roth working on the screenplay with Zemeckis. On May 11, it was announced that Robin Wright had been cast and that TriStar Pictures had acquired distribution rights for the United States, with Miramax handling international sales and production expected to begin in September 2022 for a theatrical release in 2024. On October 31, 2024, Zemeckis, during an appearance on Josh Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Happy Sad Confused&quot; podcast to promote &quot;Here&quot;, hinted at his plans to produce and direct a film adaptation of the stage musical version of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; that would also serve as a remake of the original film. Universal has yet to green-light the project after an initial rejection of Zemeckis&#x27; pitch to the studio.

== Style and recognition ==
Zemeckis is regarded as an innovator in visual effects. His exploration of state-of-the-art special effects includes the early use of computer graphics inserted into live-action footage
in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, the insertion of hand-drawn animation into live-action footage in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, and the performance capture techniques seen in &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004), &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007), &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009), and &quot;Welcome to Marwen&quot; (2018). He is known for his collaboration with composer Alan Silvestri, with whom he has worked since &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. David Thomson, a prominent film critic, wrote that &quot;no other contemporary director has used special effects to more dramatic and narrative purpose.&quot;

==Personal life==
Zemeckis has said that, for a long time, he sacrificed his personal life in favor of a career. &quot;I won an Academy Award when I was [42] years old,&quot; he explained, &quot;but I paid for it with my 20s. That decade of my life from film school till 30 was nothing but work, nothing but absolute, driving work. I had no money. I had no life.&quot; In the early 1980s, Zemeckis married actress Mary Ellen Trainor, with whom he had a son, Alexander Francis. He described the marriage as difficult to balance with filmmaking, and his relationship with Trainor eventually ended in divorce. On December 4, 2001, he married Leslie Harter, an actress, with whom he has three children.

Zemeckis is a private pilot who has logged approximately 1,600 hours of flight time, , flying a Cirrus SR22.

According to campaign donation records, Zemeckis has frequently contributed to political candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party, as well as PACs that support the interests of aircraft owners and pilots, family planning interests, and a group that advocates for Hollywood women.

Zemeckis owns a villa in the Tuscany region of Italy, which is within the ruins of a 10th-century castle and is dedicated for summer vacations.

In 2013, Zemeckis visited his father&#x27;s parents home country Lithuania and its capital city Vilnius.

<doc id="213270" wikidata="Q109331" url="?curid=213270" title="Back to the Future Part II">
<text>Back to the Future Part II is a 1989 American science fiction film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Bob Gale; both wrote the story. It is a sequel to the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and the second installment in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise. The film stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson, with Elisabeth Shue (replacing Claudia Wells) and Jeffrey Weissman (replacing Crispin Glover) in supporting roles. It follows Marty McFly (Fox) and his friend Doctor Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown (Lloyd) as they travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent the former&#x27;s son from tarnishing their family&#x27;s future. When their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen (Wilson) steals the DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to set things right.

The film was produced on a $40 million budget and was filmed back to back with its sequel &quot;Part III&quot;. Filming began in February 1989, after two years were spent building the sets and writing the scripts. &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; was also a ground-breaking project for visual effects studio Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM). In addition to digital compositing, ILM used the VistaGlide motion control camera system, which allowed an actor to portray multiple characters simultaneously on-screen without sacrificing camera movement.

&quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; was released by Universal Pictures on November 22, 1989. Though the film received mostly positive reviews, it was deemed inferior to its predecessor by critics at the time of release. In the years since, the film has been reappraised and is now considered one of the best sequels of all time. The film grossed over $332 million worldwide in its initial run, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1989. &quot;Part III&quot; followed on May 25, 1990, concluding the trilogy.

==Plot==

On October 26, 1985, Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown arrives unexpectedly in the DeLorean time machine. He persuades Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, to travel to the future with him and help their future children, with Biff Tannen witnessing their departure. Once they arrive in 2015, Doc incapacitates Jennifer, leaving her asleep in an alley to avoid letting her learn about her own future. Doc explains that their son Marty Jr. will be arrested for participating in a robbery with Biff&#x27;s grandson Griff, leading to a chain of events that destroys the McFly family.

Doc instructs Marty to switch places with the identical Marty Jr. and refuse Griff&#x27;s offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight by calling him &quot;chicken&quot;, and a subsequent hoverboard chase ensues. Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Marty&#x27;s future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an almanac containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about profiting from time travel. Before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found Jennifer incapacitated and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does an elderly Biff, who has overheard their conversation and retrieved the discarded almanac.

Jennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future life with Marty is not what she expected, due to his involvement in an automobile accident, and witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas Needles, into a shady business deal, resulting in his firing. Jennifer tries to escape the house but faints after encountering her 2015 self. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Marty and Doc, Biff steals the time machine and returns it. Marty and Doc return to 1985, leaving an unconscious Jennifer on her front porch to sleep off the day&#x27;s events as a dream.

Marty gradually realizes that the 1985 they have returned to is not the one he knows. Biff, having used the almanac to secure a fortune, is now one of the country&#x27;s wealthiest and most corrupt men. He has turned Hill Valley into a chaotic dystopia, secretly killed Marty&#x27;s father, George, in 1973, and forced Marty&#x27;s mother, Lorraine, to marry him. Meanwhile, this timeline&#x27;s version of Doc has been committed to a mental hospital. Doc deduces that old Biff took the time machine to give his younger self the almanac, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he received it on November 12, 1955. Biff, acting on his future self&#x27;s advice, tries to kill Marty, but he flees with Doc to 1955.

Marty secretly follows the 1955 Biff and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, carefully avoiding interrupting the events from his previous visit, and being forced to intervene when Biff&#x27;s gang goes after the other Marty performing onstage. Marty finally gets the almanac, but loses it after being again goaded into a fight with Biff. Marty chases after Biff&#x27;s car on the hoverboard, getting the almanac back as Biff is left to crash into a manure truck for the second time in a week.

Marty burns the almanac, nullifying the changes to the timeline that it had caused, as Doc hovers above in the time machine. Before Marty can join him, the DeLorean is struck by lightning and disappears. A Western Union courier arrives immediately after and delivers a letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who tells him that the lightning strike transported him 70 years in the past to 1885. Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, who had just helped the other Marty to return to 1985. Shocked by Marty&#x27;s sudden reappearance, Doc faints.

==Cast==


Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker and Jeffrey Weissman replaces Crispin Glover as George McFly, though Glover appears in archive footage from the first film. James Tolkan reprises his role as Mr. Strickland, as do Billy Zane, Casey Siemaszko and J. J. Cohen as Biff&#x27;s cronies Match, 3-D and Skinhead.

Griff&#x27;s gang in 2015 includes Ricky Dean Logan as Data, Darlene Vogel as Spike and Jason Scott Lee as Whitey. Stephanie E. Williams plays Officer Foley, while Zemeckis&#x27; then-wife Mary Ellen Trainor has an uncredited role as Officer Reese. Flea appears as Marty&#x27;s coworker Douglas J. Needles and James Ishida plays his boss Mr. Fujitsu. Donald Fullilove, who played Goldie Wilson in the first film, makes an uncredited appearance as his hovercar salesman grandson Goldie Wilson III. A young Elijah Wood is one of the two boys Marty teaches to play &quot;Wild Gunman&quot;.

In the alternate 1985, Al White portrays the patriarch of the family living in the McFly house. Neil Ross provides the voiceover for the Biff Tannen museum while George Buck Flower reprises his role as Red the Bum.

In 1955, Harry Waters Jr. reprises his role as Marvin Berry, Lisa Freeman reprises her role as Babs, Wesley Mann plays a student who mistakes Marty for a thief, and Joe Flaherty plays the Western Union representative who delivers Doc&#x27;s letter. Charles Fleischer plays Terry, who in 2015 indirectly gives Marty the idea to use time travel to bet on sports, and in 1955 is Biff&#x27;s mechanic.

==Development==
Director Robert Zemeckis said that initially, a sequel was not planned for the first film, but its huge box office success led to the conception of a second installment. He later agreed to do a sequel, but only if Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returned as well. With Fox and Lloyd confirmed, Zemeckis met with screenwriting partner Bob Gale to create a story for the sequel. Zemeckis and Gale would later regret that they ended the first one with Jennifer in the car with Marty and Doc Brown, because it required them to come up with a story that would fit her in, rather than a whole new adventure.

Gale wrote most of the first draft by himself as Zemeckis was busy making &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. At first, the film&#x27;s third act was to take place in 1967 where Lorraine was a flower child protesting the war and George was a college professor at Berkeley, but Zemeckis later stated that the time paradoxes of it provided a good opportunity to go back to 1955 and see the first film&#x27;s events in a different light. While most of the original cast agreed to return, a major stumbling block arose when negotiating Crispin Glover&#x27;s fee for reprising the role of George McFly. When it became clear that he would not return, the role was rewritten so that George is dead when the action takes place in the alternative version of 1985.

The greatest challenge was the creation of the futuristic vision of Marty&#x27;s hometown in 2015. Production designer Rick Carter wanted to create a very detailed image with a different tone from the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, wishing to get past the smoke and chrome. Carter and his crew spent months plotting, planning, and preparing Hill Valley&#x27;s transformation into a city of the future. Visual effects art director John Bell said that they had no script to work with, only the indications that the setting would be 30 years into the future featuring &quot;something called hoverboards&quot;.

When writing the script for &quot;Part II&quot;, Gale wanted to push the first film&#x27;s ideas further for humorous effect. Zemeckis said he was somewhat concerned about portraying the future because of the risk of making wildly inaccurate predictions. According to Gale, they tried to make the future a nice place, &quot;where what&#x27;s wrong is due to who lives in the future as opposed to the technology&quot; in contrast to the pessimistic, Orwellian future seen in most science fiction. Gale has stated that the characterization of the 1985A Biff took inspiration from Donald Trump. To keep production costs low and take advantage of an extended break Fox had from &quot;Family Ties&quot; (which was ending its run when filming began), it was shot back-to-back with sequel &quot;Part III&quot;.

==Production==
Two years were needed to finish building the sets and writing the scripts before shooting could begin. During filming the creation of the appearance of the aged characters was a well-guarded secret, involving state-of-the-art make-up techniques. Fox described the process as very time-consuming, saying that &quot;it took over four hours, although it could be worse&quot;. Principal photography began on February 20, 1989. Fox was pulling double duty, acting in the last season of &quot;Family Ties&quot; as filming began on the sequel. For a three-week period near the end of the filming, the crew split and, while most remained dedicated to shooting &quot;Part III&quot;, a few, including Gale, focused on finishing its predecessor. Zemeckis himself slept only a few hours per day, supervising both films, having to fly between Burbank, where it was being finished and other locations in California for &quot;Part III&quot;.

The film was considered one of the most ground-breaking projects for Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It was one of the effects house&#x27;s first forays into digital compositing, as well as the VistaGlide motion control camera system, which enabled them to shoot one of its most complex sequences, in which Fox played three separate characters (Marty Sr., Marty Jr., and Marlene), all of whom interacted with each other. Although such scenes were not new, the VistaGlide allowed, for the first time, a completely dynamic scene in which camera movement could finally be incorporated. The technique was also used in scenes where Fox, Thomas F. Wilson, Christopher Lloyd, and Elisabeth Shue&#x27;s characters encounter and interact with their counterparts. It also includes a brief moment of computer-generated imagery in a holographic shark used to promote a fictional &quot;Jaws 19&quot;, which wound up unaltered from the first test done by ILM&#x27;s digital department because effects supervisor Ken Ralston &quot;liked the fact that it was all messed up.&quot;

Animation supervisor Wes Takahashi, who then was the head of ILM&#x27;s animation department, worked heavily on the film&#x27;s time travel sequences, as he had done in the original film and in &quot;Part III&quot;. As &quot;Part II&quot; neared release, sufficient footage of &quot;Part III&quot; had been shot to allow a trailer to be assembled. It was added to the conclusion of &quot;Part II&quot; before the closing credits, as a reassurance to moviegoers that there was more to follow.

===Replacement of Crispin Glover and lawsuit===

Crispin Glover was asked to reprise the role of George McFly. He expressed interest, but could not come to an agreement with the producers regarding his salary. He stated in a 1992 interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that the producers&#x27; highest offer was $125,000, less than half of what the other returning cast members were offered. Gale has since asserted that Glover&#x27;s demands were excessive for an actor of his professional stature at that time. In an interview on the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; show in 2013, Glover stated that his primary reason for not doing &quot;Part II&quot; was a philosophical disagreement on the film&#x27;s message; Glover felt the story rewarded the characters with financial gain, such as Marty&#x27;s truck, rather than love.

Rather than write George out of the film, Zemeckis used previously filmed footage of Glover from the first film as well as new footage of actor Jeffrey Weissman, who wore prosthetics including a false chin, nose, and cheekbones to resemble Glover. Various techniques were used to obfuscate the Weissman footage, such as placing him in the background rather than the foreground, having him wear sunglasses, and hanging him upside down. Glover would also learn from Weissman that the molds created from his face to make the aging prosthetics for 1985 George McFly in the first film were reused to make the prosthetics for Weissman&#x27;s portrayal. Unhappy with this, Glover filed a lawsuit against the producers of the film on the grounds that they neither owned his likeness nor had permission to use it. As a result of the suit, there are now clauses in the Screen Actors Guild collective bargaining agreements stating that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors. Glover&#x27;s legal action, while resolved outside of the courts, has been considered as a key case in personality rights for actors with increasing use of improved special effects and digital techniques, in which actors may have agreed to appear in one part of a production but have their likenesses be used in another without their agreement.

===Replacement of Claudia Wells===

Claudia Wells planned to reprise her role as Marty&#x27;s girlfriend Jennifer Parker, but when filming coincided with a family cancer crisis, she chose to care for her mother&#x27;s health. After the producers cast Elisabeth Shue as a replacement, they re-shot the closing scenes of the first film for the beginning of &quot;Part II&quot;, in a nearly shot-for-shot match with the original.

Wells returned to acting with a starring role in the 2008 independent film &quot;Still Waters Burn&quot;. She is one of the few cast members not to make an appearance within the bonus material on the &quot;Back to the Future Trilogy&quot; DVD set released in 2002. However, she is interviewed for the &quot;Tales from the Future&quot; documentaries in the trilogy&#x27;s 25th anniversary issue on Blu-ray Disc in 2010. Wells would also later reprise her role from the first film, 26 years after her last appearance in the series, providing the voice of Jennifer for &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot; by Telltale Games in 2011.

===Hoverboard hoax===
Zemeckis said jokingly on the film&#x27;s behind-the-scenes featurette that the hoverboards (flying skateboards) used in it were real, yet not released to the public, due to parental complaints regarding safety. Footage of &quot;real hoverboards&quot; was also featured in the extras of a DVD release of the trilogy. A number of people thought Zemeckis was telling the truth and requested them at toy stores. In an interview, Wilson said one of the most frequent questions he was asked was if they are real.

==Depiction of the future==
Although the filmmakers researched contemporary predictions by scientists on what might occur by 2015, Zemeckis has said that the film was not meant to be a serious attempt at predicting the future. In 2010, he commented: &quot;For me, filming the future scenes of the movie were the least enjoyable of making the whole trilogy, because I don&#x27;t really like films that try and predict the future. The only ones I&#x27;ve actually enjoyed were the ones done by Stanley Kubrick, and not even he predicted the PC when he made &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. So, rather than trying to make a scientifically sound prediction that we were probably going to get wrong anyway, we figured, let&#x27;s just make it funny&quot;. Similarly, Gale said: &quot;We knew we weren&#x27;t going to have flying cars by the year 2015, but God we had to have those in our movie&quot;.

However, the film did correctly predict a number of technological and sociological changes that occurred by 2015, including: the rise of ubiquitous cameras; use of unmanned flying drones for newsgathering; widescreen flat-panel television sets mounted on walls with multiple channel viewing; smart home technology; video chat systems; hands-free video games; talking animated billboards; wearable technology; tablet computers with fingerprint scanners and head-mounted displays. Payment on personal portable devices is also depicted. Although payment by thumbprint is not widely used, fingerprint scanning is in use as security at places such as airports and schools, and electronic payment with fingerprint scanning as a security feature is deployed for Apple Pay.

Other aspects of the depiction of the future would not come to pass by 2015, but efforts were made to replicate those technology advances.

The film shows Marty putting on Nike &quot;Air Mag&quot; tennis shoes with automatic shoelaces. Nike released a version of their Hyperdunk Supreme shoes, which appear similar to Marty&#x27;s, in July 2008. Fans dubbed them the &quot;Air McFly&quot;. In April 2009, they filed the patent for self-lacing shoes, and their design bears a resemblance to those worn by Marty in the film. In 2010, a fan named Blake Bevin created shoes that tie themselves. Though Nike had made a very limited quantity of Air Mags in the same style as the movie, they stated in September 2011 that their consumer-line MAG line of shoes would not feature the self-lacing feature shown in it. Tinker Hatfield, one of the shoe&#x27;s designers, indicated in 2014 that they would introduce shoes with power-lacing technology the following year, 2015. In March 2016, Nike unveiled the HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe, a consumer-market model of the Air Mag which features the same self-lacing technology used for the commemorative Air Mags; these were put on sale in limited quantities in late 2016.

The producers created a futuristic flying car to depict a typical taxi cab in the future world of 2015. This taxi was based on the Citroën DS.

The concept of the hoverboard—a skateboard that can float off the ground—has been explored by various groups since the release of the film. Attempts similar to hoverboats, which blast air at the ground, have been demonstrated, with a 2021 record distance of . A different type is the MagBoard, developed by researchers at the Paris Diderot University. It uses a large superconductor plate on the bottom cooled with liquid nitrogen as to achieve the Meissner effect and allow it to float over a special track; it was shown capable of carrying the weight of a human in its practical demonstration. However, the requirement to run the superconductor at higher, more ambient temperatures prevents this from becoming practical. In March 2014, a company named HUVr Tech purportedly demonstrated a working hoverboard along with several celebrities including Lloyd, though this shortly was revealed as a hoax created by the website Funny or Die. Self-balancing &#x27;hoverboards&#x27; became popular in 2015 even though they do not hover above the ground.

In the 2015 scene, the film imagines the Chicago Cubs winning the 2015 World Series against the fictional Miami-based Gators, referring to the Cubs&#x27; longstanding failure to win a championship. In the actual 2015 season, the Cubs qualified for the postseason, their first postseason appearance since 2008, but lost the National League Championship Series (not the World Series) to the New York Mets on October 21, which coincidentally was the same day as &quot;&quot;Back to the Future&quot; Day&quot;, the day Marty McFly arrived in 2015 in the film. Despite losing, one year later the Cubs &quot;did&quot; win the 2016 World Series against the Cleveland Indians; in congratulations to the Cubs, the official Twitter feed for the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise jokingly tweeted out that Marty &amp; Doc&#x27;s time-traveling caused &quot;a rift in the space-time continuum&quot; that led to the 1994 strike (and subsequent cancellation of the 1994 World Series), thus delaying the accurate prediction by a year. In the real 2015 World Series, the Kansas City Royals defeated the Mets to win their first World Series championship since 1985, the year which Marty and Doc time traveled in the film. As for the fictional Miami team, when the film was made, Florida did not have a Major League Baseball team, but has since gained two: the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins) in 1993 and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now the Tampa Bay Rays) in 1998. While both teams have each made two appearances in the World Series (the Marlins winning in 1997 and 2003, and the Rays losing in 2008 and 2020), neither qualified for the postseason in 2015. Another sport mentioned in the film, SlamBall, would indeed become a real sport in 2002.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
The film was released to theaters in North America on Wednesday, November 22, 1989, the day before Thanksgiving. It grossed a total of $27.8 million over Friday to Sunday, and $43 million across the five-day holiday opening, breaking the previous Thanksgiving record set by &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in 1985. On the following weekend, it had a drop of 56 percent, earning $12.1 million, but remained at number 1. Its total gross was $118.5 million in the United States and $213 million overseas, for a total of $332 million worldwide, ranking as 1989&#x27;s sixth-most successful film domestically and the third-most worldwide—behind &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;. However this was still short of the first film&#x27;s gross. &quot;Part III&quot;, which Universal released only six months later, experienced a similar drop. In Japan, it had a record opening, grossing $7.5 million in six days from 153 screens.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Back to the Future II&quot; is far more uneven than its predecessor, but its madcap highs outweigh the occasionally cluttered machinations of an overstuffed plot&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars. Ebert criticized it for lacking the &quot;genuine power of the original&quot; but praised it for its slapstick humor and the hoverboard in its chase sequence. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;ready for bigger and better things&quot; and later said that it &quot;manages to be giddily and merrily mind-boggling, rather than confusing&quot;. Tom Tunney of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote that the film was well-directed, &quot;high-energy escapism&quot;, and called it &quot;solidly entertaining&quot;, though noting it as being inferior to the other two films in the franchise.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; gave the film a negative review, criticizing Zemeckis and Gale for turning the characters into &quot;strident geeks&quot; and for making the frenetic action formulaic. He believed that it contained &quot;rampant misogyny&quot;, because the character of Jennifer Parker &quot;is knocked unconscious early on so she won&#x27;t interfere with the little-boy games&quot;. He cited, as well, Michael J. Fox dressing in drag. &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;[Director Robert] Zemeckis&#x27; fascination with having characters interact at different ages of their lives hurts it visually, and strains credibility past the breaking point, by forcing him to rely on some very cheesy makeup designs&quot;.

In 2018, Bob Gale, who co-wrote the movie with Robert Zemeckis, said the movie received a mixed reception because of the dark aspect of the story: &quot;They [the audiences] were absolutely surprised by it. The whole 1985 stuff... we went places the audience was not ready to go. That is some of my favorite stuff in the whole trilogy&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film won the Saturn Award for Best Special Effects (for Ken Ralston, the special effects supervisor), the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects (Ken Ralston, Michael Lantieri, John Bell and Steve Gawley), an Internet-voted 2003 AOL Movies DVD Premiere Award for the trilogy DVDs, a Golden Screen Award, a Young Artist Award, and the Blimp Awards for Favorite Movie Actor (Michael J. Fox), and Favorite Movie Actress (Lea Thompson) at the 1990 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. It was nominated in 1990 for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (John Bell, Steve Gawley, Michael Lantieri and Ken Ralston), but lost to &quot;The Abyss&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc on May 22, 1990, three days before the theatrical release of &quot;Part III&quot;. It was due to be the first release under the MCA/Universal Home Video banner. Universal reissued it on VHS, LaserDisc, and compact disc in 1991, 1995, and 1998. On December 17, 2002, Universal released it on DVD in a boxed trilogy set, although widescreen framing problems led to a product recall. The trilogy was released on Blu-ray Disc in October 2010.

Universal re-released the trilogy alongside new features on DVD and Blu-ray on October 20, 2015, coinciding with &quot;Back to the Future Day&quot; the following day. The new set included a featurette called &quot;Doc Brown Saves the World&quot;, where Lloyd, reprising his role as Doc Brown, explains the reasons for the differences between the future of 2015 as depicted in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and in real life. A new remaster as part of &quot;Back to the Future: The Ultimate Trilogy&quot; on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray was released on October 20, 2020.

In May 2020, the trilogy was released for streaming on Netflix. A small edit was noticed to &quot;Part II&quot; during the scene featuring the fictional soft porn magazine called &quot;Oh La La!&quot; in which the shot showing the reveal of the magazine cover is cut short, omitting sight of the magazine itself. Gale stated that neither he nor Zemeckis were aware of this change, and believed it originated from a foreign print of the film. Shortly afterwards, Universal provided Netflix with the unedited, theatrical version of the film, replacing the censored cut on the streaming platform.

==Music==

The soundtrack was released by MCA Records on November 22, 1989. AllMusic rated it four-and-a-half stars out of five. Unlike the previous soundtrack, it contains only a musical score by composer Alan Silvestri. None of the vocal songs featured throughout the film are included. On October 12, 2015, Intrada Records released the complete score of &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; in a 2-disc set including early scoring sessions and alternative takes.

<text>In grammar, a frequentative form (abbreviated &#x27; or &#x27;) of a word indicates repeated action but is not to be confused with iterative aspect. The frequentative form can be considered a separate but not completely independent word called a frequentative. The frequentative is no longer productive in English, unlike in some language groups, such as Finno-Ugric, Balto-Slavic, and Turkic.

== English ==
English has &quot;-le&quot; and -&quot;er&quot; as frequentative suffixes. Some frequentative verbs surviving in English, and their parent verbs are listed below. Additionally, some frequentative verbs are formed by reduplication of a monosyllable (e.g., &quot;coo-cooing&quot;, &quot;cf.&quot; Latin &quot;murmur&quot;). Frequentative nouns are often formed by combining two different vowel grades of the same word (as in &quot;teeter-totter&quot;, &quot;pitter-patter&quot;, &quot;chitchat&quot;.)

==Finnish==
In Finnish, a frequentative verb signifies a single action repeated, &quot;around the place&quot; both spatially and temporally. The complete translation would be &quot;go — around aimlessly&quot;. There is a large array of different frequentatives, indicated by lexical agglutinative markers. In general, one frequentative is &quot;-:i-&quot;, and another &quot;-ele-&quot;, but it is almost always combined with something else. Some forms:
* &quot;sataa — sadella — satelee&quot; &quot;to rain — to rain occasionally — it rains occasionally&quot;
* &quot;ampua — ammuskella — ammuskelen&quot; &quot;to shoot — go shooting around — I go shooting around&quot;
* &quot;juosta — juoksennella — juoksentelen &quot; &quot;to run — to run around (to and fro) — I run around&quot;
* &quot;kirjoittaa — kirjoitella — kirjoittelen&quot; &quot;to write — to write (something short) occasionally — I write &quot;around&quot;&quot;
* &quot;järjestää — järjestellä — järjestelen&quot; &quot;to put in order — to arrange continuously, to play around — I play around (with them) in order to put them in order&quot;
* &quot;heittää — heittelehtiä — heittelehdit&quot; &quot;to throw — to swerve — you swerve&quot;
* &quot;loikata — loikkia — loikin&quot; &quot;to jump once — to jump (again and again) — I jump (again and again)&quot;
* &quot;istua — istuksia — istuksit&quot; &quot;to sit — to sit (randomly somewhere), loiter — you loiter there by sitting&quot;

There are several frequentative morphemes, underlined above; these are affected by consonant gradation as indicated. Their meanings are slightly different; see the list, arranged &quot;infinitive&quot;~&quot;personal&quot;:
*&quot;-ella&quot;~&quot;-ele-&quot;: bare frequentative.
*&quot;-skella&quot;~&quot;-skele-&quot;: frequentative unergative verb, where the action is wanton (arbitrary)
*&quot;-stella&quot;~&quot;-stele-&quot;: frequentative causative, where the subject causes something indicated in the root, as &quot;order&quot; vs. &quot;to continuously try to put something in order&quot;.
*&quot;-nnella&quot;~&quot;-ntele-&quot;: a frequentative, where an actor is required. The marker &quot;-nt-&quot; indicates a continuing effort, therefore &quot;-ntele-&quot; indicates a series of such efforts.
*&quot;-elehtia&quot;~&quot;-elehdi-&quot;: movement that is random and compulsive, as in under pain, e.g. &quot;vääntelehtiä&quot; &quot;writhe in pain&quot;, or &quot;heittelehtiä&quot; &quot;to swerve&quot;
*&quot;-:ia-&quot;~&quot;-i-&quot;: a continuing action definitely at a point in time, where the action or effort is repeated.
*&quot;-ksia&quot;~&quot;-ksi-&quot;: same as &quot;-i-&quot;, but wanton, cf. &quot;-skella&quot;

Frequentatives may be combined with momentanes, that is, to indicate the repetition of a short, sudden action. The momentane &quot;-ahta-&quot; can be prefixed with the frequentative &quot;-ele-&quot; to produce the morpheme &quot;-ahtele-&quot;, as in &quot;täristä&quot; &quot;to shake (continuously)&quot; → &quot;tärähtää&quot; &quot;to shake suddenly once&quot; → &quot;tärähdellä&quot; &quot;to shake, such that a single, sudden shaking is repeated&quot;. For example, the contrast between these is that ground shakes (&quot;maa tärisee&quot;) continuously when a large truck goes by, the ground shakes once (&quot;maa tärähtää&quot;) when a cannon fires, and the ground shakes suddenly but repeatedly (&quot;maa tärähtelee&quot;) when a battery of cannons is firing.

Since the frequentative is a lexical, not a grammatical contrast, considerable semantic drift may have occurred.

For a list of different real and hypothetical forms, see:

Loanwords are put into the frequentative form, if the action is such. If the action can be nothing else but frequentative, the &quot;basic form&quot; doesn&#x27;t even exist, such as with &quot;to go shopping&quot;.

* &quot;surffata — surffailla&quot; &quot;to surf — to surf (around in the net)&quot;
* &quot;*shopata — shoppailla&quot; &quot;*to shop once — to go shopping&quot;

Adjectives can similarly receive frequentative markers: &quot;iso — isotella&quot; &quot;big — to talk big&quot;, or &quot;feikkailla&quot; &lt; English &quot;fake&quot; &quot;to be fake, blatantly and consistently&quot;.

==Greek==
In Homer and Herodotus, there is a past frequentative, usually called &quot;past iterative&quot;, with an additional -sk- suffix before the endings.
* &quot;I used to have&quot; (imperfect &quot;ékh-on&quot;)

The same suffix is used in inchoative verbs in both Ancient Greek and Latin.

The infix may occur in the forms -σκ-, -ασκ-, and -εσκ-. Homer regularly omits the augment. The iterative occurs most often in the imperfect, but also in the aorist.

== Hungarian ==
In Hungarian it is quite common and everyday to use frequentative.

Frequentative verbs are formed with the suffix &quot;–gat&quot; (&quot;–get&quot; after a front vowel; see vowel harmony). Also there is a so-called Template rule, which forces another vowel in between the base verb and the affix resulting in a word containing at least three syllables. Verbal prefixes (coverbs) do not count as a syllable.

Some verbs&#x27; frequentative forms have acquired an independent non-frequentative meaning. In these cases the three syllables rule is not applied as the form is not considered a frequentative. These words can be affixed with &quot;–gat&quot; again to create a frequentative meaning.

In rare cases non-verbs can be affixed by &quot;–gat&quot; to give them similar modification in meaning as to verbs. In most cases these non-verbs are obviously related to some actions, like a typical outcome or object. The resulting word basically has the same meaning as if the related verb were affixed with &quot;–gat&quot;.

The change in meaning of a frequentative compared to the base can be different depending on the base: The &quot;–gat&quot; affix can modify the occurrences or the intensity or both of an action. Occasionally it produces a specific meaning which is related but distinct from the original form&#x27;s.

Examples:
==Latin==
In Latin, frequentative verbs indicate repeated or intense action. They are usually formed from the supine stem with &quot;-āre&quot; added.
*cantāre, ‘(continue to) sing’ (&lt; canere, ‘sing a song’). (This frequentative form was used often enough that it displaced and drove the basal form into extinction in modern Romance languages.)
*cursāre ‘run around’ (&lt; currere, ‘run’)
*dictāre ‘dictate’ (&lt; dīcere, ‘speak, say’)
*dormītāre &#x27;be drowsy, fall asleep&#x27; (&lt; dormīre, &#x27;sleep&#x27;)
*iactāre, ‘shake, disturb’ (&lt; iacere, ‘throw, cast’)
*pulsāre, ‘beat’ (&lt; pellere, ‘push’)
*saltāre, &#x27;dance, jump&#x27; (&lt; salīre, &#x27;leap&#x27;)
*spectāre, &#x27;watch&#x27; (&lt; specere, more usually aspicere, &#x27;take a look at&#x27;)
*versāre, ‘turn often, keep turning’ (&lt; vertere, ‘turn’)

The following, exceptionally, is 3rd conjugation:
*vīsere, &#x27;look at attentively, visit&#x27; (&lt; vidēre, &#x27;see&#x27;)

Occasionally, however, they are formed not from the supine but from the present stem with &quot;-itāre&quot;.
*agitāre, ‘put into motion’ (&lt; agere, ‘do, drive’)
*clāmitāre, &#x27;keep shouting&#x27; (&lt; clāmāre, &#x27;shout&#x27;)
*habitāre, &#x27;reside, dwell (somewhere)&#x27; (&lt; habēre, &#x27;have&#x27;, in pre-classical times it also had a meaning of reside, dwell )
*minitārī, &#x27;keep threatening&#x27; (&lt; minārī, &#x27;threaten&#x27;)
*vocitāre, &#x27;be wont to call&#x27; / &#x27;keep calling&#x27; (&lt; vocāre, &#x27;call&#x27;)

The following is irregular since the supine of &quot;nāre&quot; is &quot;nātum&quot; with a long ā:
*natāre, &#x27;swim, float&#x27; (&lt; nāre, &#x27;swim, float&#x27;)

A frequentative verb can be made doubly frequentative by adding -&quot;itāre&quot; to a supine:
*cursitāre ‘run here and there’ (&lt; currere, ‘run’)
*dictitāre ‘say often or emphatically’ (&lt; dīcere, ‘speak, say’)
*ventitāre, ‘come frequently or repeatedly’ (&lt; venīre, ‘come’; see Catullus 8, line 4)
*vīsitāre, &#x27;visit&#x27; (&lt; vidēre, &#x27;see&#x27;)

Some frequentative verbs have no simple form:
*gustāre, &#x27;taste&#x27;
*hortārī, &#x27;exhort&#x27;

== Lithuanian ==
Lithuanian has a past frequentative (or iterative), which serves to express a single action repeated in the past. Starting from the infinitive without , it is formed by adding the invariant morpheme followed by the regular past tense suffix of the first conjugation. For instance, (&quot;to work&quot;, a first-conjugation verb), whose plain past tense is (&quot;I worked&quot; or &quot;I have worked&quot;), has a past iterative of (&quot;I used to work&quot;). The six intersections of person and number map onto five distinct frequentative endings; there is no morphological distinction of number in the third person, nor of conjugation class in general.

The closest relative of Lithuanian, Latvian, as well as the Samogitian dialect of the language, has no separate past tense to mark iterative aspect; in its place, however, both may express it by means of periphrasis. An auxiliary verb – in Latvian and in Samogitian – will then occupy the syntactic centre of the verb phrase (subject to conjugation), relegating the main verb to trail it as an (invariant) infinitive complement.

Consider the following three translations of the English sentence &quot;We used to read a lot.&quot;
* Lithuanian: 
* Samogitian: 
* Latvian: 

==Polish==

In the Polish language, certain imperfective verbs ending in &quot;-ać&quot; denote repeated or habitual action.
* &quot;jeść&quot; (to eat) → &quot;jadać&quot; (to eat habitually)
* &quot;iść&quot; (to walk) → &quot;chadzać&quot;. 
* &quot;widzieć&quot; (to see) → &quot;widywać&quot;
* &quot;pisać&quot; (to write) → &quot;pisywać&quot;
* &quot;czytać&quot; (to read) → &quot;czytywać&quot;

The interfix &quot;-yw-&quot; used to form many frequentative verbs has a different function for prefixed perfective verbs: it serves to create their imperfective equivalents. For instance, &quot;rozczytywać&quot; (to try to read something barely legible) is simply an imperfective equivalent of &quot;rozczytać&quot; (to succeed at reading something barely legible).

==Russian==

In the Russian language, the frequentative form of verbs to denote a repeated or customary action is produced by inserting suffixes -ива-/-ыва-, -ва- or -а́-, often accompanied with a change in the root of the word (vowel alternation, change of the last root consonant) and stress shift.
* ви́деть (to see) → ви́дывать (to see repeatedly)
* сиде́ть (to sit) → си́живать
* ходи́ть (to walk) → ха́живать
* носи́ть (to wear) → на́шивать
* гла́дить (to stroke) → погла́живать
* знать (to know) → знава́ть
* есть (to eat) → еда́ть
* писа́ть (to write) → попи́сывать

An interesting example is with the word &quot;брать&quot; (to take); an archaic usage recorded among hunters, normally used in the past tense, in hunter&#x27;s boasting: бирал, бирывал meaning &quot;used to take (quite a few) trophies&quot;.

==Reduplication==
The simplest way to produce a frequentative is reduplication, either of the entire word or of one of its phonemes. This is common in Austronesian languages such as Niuean, although reduplication also serves to pluralize and intensify nouns and adjectives.

<doc id="213275" wikidata="Q230552" url="?curid=213275" title="Back to the Future Part III">
<text>Back to the Future Part III is a 1990 American science fiction Western film and the third installment of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson, and Lea Thompson. The film continues immediately following &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989); while stranded in 1955 during his time travel adventures, Marty McFly (Fox) discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown (Lloyd), trapped in 1885, was killed by Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen (Wilson), Biff&#x27;s great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with Clara Clayton (Steenburgen).

&quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; was filmed in California and Arizona, and was produced on a $40 million budget back-to-back with &quot;Part II&quot;. &quot;Part III&quot; was released in the United States on May 25, 1990, six months after the previous installment, and grossed $245 million worldwide during its initial run, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1990. The film received a positive response from critics, who noted it as an improvement over &quot;Part II&quot;.

==Plot==

In November 1955, moments after witnessing Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown disappear in his DeLorean, Marty McFly learns that Doc was sent 70 years in the past to 1885. Using information from Doc&#x27;s 1885 letter, Marty and the 1955 Doc find and repair the DeLorean so Marty can return to 1985. However, after finding it, Marty comes across a tombstone with Doc&#x27;s name, with the inscription stating that Doc was shot by Biff Tannen&#x27;s great-grandfather, Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen, six days after writing the letter.

Despite the letter&#x27;s warning, Marty travels back to September 2, 1885, to save Doc, arriving in the middle of a cavalry pursuit of Native Americans, but the car&#x27;s fuel line is damaged in the process. Chased by a bear, he is knocked out and found by his Irish-born great-great-grandparents Seamus and Maggie McFly, who allow him to stay for the night. The next morning, under the alias Clint Eastwood, Marty arrives in a newly-founded Hill Valley, but runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford tries hanging Marty, but fails when Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after learning his fate, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach its required . He thus proposes using a steam locomotive to push the DeLorean to that speed.

While inspecting a rail spur, Doc saves the town’s new schoolteacher Clara Clayton from falling into the ravine, averting her death from the original timeline. They fall in love at first sight and form a close relationship. At a town festival for the courthouse, Buford tries shooting Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford then challenges him to a showdown in two days by calling him &quot;yellow&quot;; an angry Marty accepts, believing that he and Doc would have left by then. Doc urges Marty not to react to provocation, letting slip that Marty has a life changing accident in the future.

Although he is reluctant to return to 1985, Doc eventually visits Clara to end their relationship and bid her goodbye. However, feeling insulted, she dismisses his story about being from the future. Despondent, he goes for a binge. In the morning, Buford arrives for Marty, who sees his alias appear in the photograph of the tombstone and refuses to duel. Doc passes out after downing just one shot; he is eventually revived, but is captured by Buford&#x27;s gang, forcing Marty into the duel. Marty fools Buford into believing that he was fatally shot and knocks him into a wagon of manure. Buford and his gang are promptly arrested for an earlier robbery.

On the train to San Francisco, Clara learns how heartbroken Doc is and runs back to town. She finds the model of the time machine at his shop. Realizing that Doc was telling the truth, she heads back to meet him. Using a stolen locomotive named Greyhound, Doc and Marty push the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive and, attempting to reach Doc, nearly falls off. Marty, in the DeLorean, passes his hoverboard to Doc, and he uses it to save Clara and carry her to safety. Marty hits 88 mph and vanishes as the overheated Greyhound falls off the unfinished bridge.

Arriving back in 1985 on October 27, Marty escapes from the powerless DeLorean just before an oncoming freight train destroys it. Reuniting with his girlfriend Jennifer Parker, Marty declines a street race with Douglas J. Needles, thus avoiding the future accident Doc warned him about. Jennifer opens the fax message she kept from 2015 and watches as the text regarding Marty&#x27;s firing disappears.

As Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a steam locomotive suddenly appears, operated by Doc, Clara, and their children. Doc gives Marty a photo of them standing next to the town clock in 1885. When Jennifer asks Doc about the blank fax, he states that it means that their future has not yet been written and encourages them to make it a good one. Doc and his family bid farewell and fly off in the locomotive to an unknown time.

==Cast==

Returning actors from previous films include Elisabeth Shue and Flea as Jennifer Parker and Douglas J. Needles, as well as Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber and Jeffrey Weissman as Dave, Linda and George McFly, respectively. James Tolkan, who played Mr. Strickland in the first two films, plays his ancestor Marshal James Strickland.

Buford&#x27;s gang in 1885 is portrayed by Christopher Wynne, Sean Gregory Sullivan, and Mike Watson. Wynne also plays a member of Needles&#x27; gang in 1985, alongside J. J. Cohen and Ricky Dean Logan, who played Skinhead and Data, respectively, in previous films.

Chester the bartender is played by Matt Clark, and three elderly patrons of the saloon are played by veteran Western film actors Pat Buttram, Harry Carey, Jr. and Dub Taylor. Hugh Gillin, Burton Gilliam, Donovan Scott and Bill McKinney portray Hill Valley&#x27;s mayor, a gun salesman, Strickland&#x27;s deputy, and an engineer respectively. Todd Cameron Brown and Dannel Evans play Doc and Clara&#x27;s sons Jules and Verne Brown, and Lindsay Vail Clark portrays William McFly, Marty&#x27;s great-grandfather. Frank Beard, Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill of ZZ Top cameo as the band at the Festival.

==Production==

The origins of the western theme for &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; lay in the production of the original film. During filming for the original, director Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time period he would like to see. Fox replied that he wanted to visit the Old West and meet cowboys. Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale were intrigued by the idea, but held it off until &quot;Part III&quot;. Rather than use existing sets, the filmmakers built the 1885 Hill Valley from scratch. The western scenes were filmed on location in Oak Park, California and Monument Valley. Some of the location shooting for the 1885 Hill Valley was done in Jamestown, California, and on a purpose-built set at the Red Hills Ranch near Sonora, California. Some of the train scenes were filmed at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park, a heritage line in Jamestown.

The shooting of the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; sequels, which were shot back-to-back throughout 1989, reunited much of the crew of the original. The films were shot over the course of eleven months, save for a three-week hiatus between filming of &quot;Parts II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;, and concluded in January 1990. The most grueling part was editing &quot;Part II&quot; while filming &quot;Part III&quot;, and Zemeckis bore the brunt of the process over a three-week period. While Zemeckis was shooting most of the train sequences in Sonora, Gale was in Los Angeles supervising the final dub of &quot;Part II&quot;. Zemeckis would wrap photography and board a private plane to Burbank, where Gale and engineers would greet him on the dubbing stage with dinner. He would oversee the reels completed that day, and make changes where needed. Afterwards, he would retire to the Sheraton Universal Hotel for the night. The following morning, Zemeckis would drive to the Burbank Airport, board a flight back to the set in Northern California, and continue to shoot the film.

Although the schedule for most of the personnel involved was grueling, the actors found the remote location for &quot;Part III&quot; relaxing, compared to shooting its predecessor.

The role of Clara Clayton was written with Mary Steenburgen in mind. When she received the script, however, she was reluctant to commit to the film until her children, who had loved the first film, &quot;hounded&quot; her.

The Hill Valley Festival Dance scene proved to be the most dangerous for Lloyd and Steenburgen; overzealous dancing left Steenburgen with a torn ligament in her foot.

The film also featured cameos from veteran Western film actors Pat Buttram, Harry Carey Jr. and Dub Taylor as three &quot;saloon old timers&quot;. The inclusion of these noticeable Western actors was promoted in several documentaries about the film, as well as the behind-the-scenes documentary of the DVD and in the obituary of one of the actors. Zemeckis considered having Ronald Reagan play the part of the Mayor of Hill Valley in 1885. Reagan, who in 1989 had just recently finished his second term as president, had appeared in several Westerns during his earlier career as an actor. Zemeckis contacted Reagan&#x27;s agent, Lew Wasserman, to gauge the ex-president&#x27;s interest in the role, to which Reagan declined.

Shooting a film set in the Old West was appealing to the stuntmen, who were all experienced horse riders. Gale recalled in 2002 that many stuntmen in Hollywood wanted to work on &quot;Part III&quot;. Thomas F. Wilson, who played Buford Tannen, chose to perform his own stunts and spent a great deal of time learning to ride a horse and throw his lariat. Filming was paused when Fox&#x27;s father died, and when his son was born.

Alan Silvestri returned to compose the score for &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, continuing his longtime collaboration with Zemeckis. Rather than dictate how the music should sound, Zemeckis directed Silvestri as he would an actor, seeking to evoke emotion and treating every piece of music like a character. The musicians of the Old West-style band in the film were played by American rock band ZZ Top.

The photography in &quot;Part III&quot; was a &quot;dream&quot; for cinematographer Dean Cundey, who shared with much of the crew his excitement to shoot a Western. Zemeckis wished to create a spectacular climax to the film. He coordinated the actors, a live 4-6-0 ten wheeler steam locomotive (the Sierra Railway 3), pyrotechnics, and special effects, and countless technicians all at once. As they had done with the previous two films in the trilogy, the visual effects for &quot;Part III&quot; were managed by effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic; the head of its animation department, Wes Takahashi, returned to once again animate the DeLorean&#x27;s time travel sequences.

==Home media and music==

On November 8, 1990, MCA/Universal Home Video released &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; on VHS and on December 17, 2002, on DVD. It debuted on Blu-ray in 2010 for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, followed by a second Blu-ray remaster in 2015 for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary and a 4K Blu-ray remaster in 2020 for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

The soundtrack was released under Varèse Sarabande on May 29, 1990, and features most of the score by Alan Silvestri and the orchestral version of the song &quot;Doubleback&quot; performed at the festival in 1885 during the film. A two-disc special edition was released on October 12, 2015, in commemoration of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, which includes the original score (26 tracks) on disc one and an arrangement of alternate cues and source music on a second disc.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $23 million in its first weekend of U.S. release and $87.6 million altogether in U.S. box office receipts (or about $ million adjusted as of ) – $246 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale, same as the second installment.

Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, saying that the film &quot;restores heart interest of the first film and has a satisfying complete storyline&quot;. He praised Michael J. Fox for &quot;keeping the plot on the move&quot; and mentioned that Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen&#x27;s romance was &quot;funny&quot;. He said that the film&#x27;s ending was the &quot;neatest of all&quot; and it &quot;features one of the best time machines in the cinema, promising that this is indeed the very last in the series and neatly wrapping it up for everybody&quot;.

Leonard Maltin preferred the film to the first two, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the film as great fun, special effects and imagination, also saying that the movie magic works in the film. Michael McWhertor of the website &quot;Polygon&quot; wrote that while the film was not better than the original entry in the series, it is nonetheless &quot;leagues better than the second&quot;; he praised the film&#x27;s comedic and romantic elements, and commended Thomas F. Wilson&#x27;s performance as &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars. He said that the film&#x27;s western motifs are &quot;a sitcom version that looks exactly as if it were built on a back lot somewhere&quot;. Although Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Christopher Lloyd&#x27;s performance in the film, he also said that the film &quot;looks as if it could be the beginning of a continuing television series&quot;. He complained that the film is &quot;so sweet-natured and bland that it is almost instantly forgettable&quot;.

Commentators noticed parallels between &quot;Part III&quot; and the film &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979). Mary Steenburgen has said:
Actually, I&#x27;ve played the same scene in that film [&quot;Time After Time&quot;] and in [&quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;]…. I&#x27;ve had a man from a different time period tell me that he&#x27;s in love with me, but he has to go back to his own time. My response in both cases is, of course, disbelief, and I order them out of my life. Afterwards, I find out I was wrong and that, in fact, the man is indeed from another time, and I go after him (them) to profess my love. It&#x27;s a pretty strange feeling to find yourself doing the same scene, so many years apart, for the second time in your career. The casting of Steenburgen for &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; appears to be deliberately intended to mirror the earlier role. In &quot;Time After Time&quot;, the woman lives in the 20th century and the time traveler is from the 19th. In &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, the woman inhabits the 19th century and the time traveler is from the 20th.

===Accolades===
In 1990, the film won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Alan Silvestri and a Best Supporting Actor award for Thomas F. Wilson. In 2003, it received an AOL Movies DVD Premiere Award for Best Special Edition of the Year, an award based on consumer online voting.

==Future==
Co-writer and director Robert Zemeckis, who has final rights to all films in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise, has stated that he will block all attempts to remake or reboot the original film. Co-writer Bob Gale commented that he did not wish to see another film in the series without the Marty McFly character nor any other actor than Michael J. Fox playing him, while acknowledging that Fox&#x27;s current health condition would make this impossible. He illustrated this at a 2008 fan convention in Florida, stating: &quot;The idea of making another &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movie without Michael J. Fox – you know, that&#x27;s like saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to cook you a steak dinner and I&#x27;m going to hold the beef. Gale also said that the Telltale video-game adaptation is the closest thing to what a fourth film could be like. In an interview on October 21, 2015, the day of Marty McFly&#x27;s purported arrival in the future, Christopher Lloyd stated that he would consider making a fourth film under the condition that the original cast and creative team returned, along with a story &quot;worth telling&quot;. The same day, Lloyd reprised his role as Doc Brown in a brief segment in which the character returns with a special message marking the 2015 date. In 2020, actor Tom Holland claimed in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that he was approached by an unnamed producer over a possible reboot of the franchise with him starring the lead role as Marty McFly (or a similarly new character). However, Holland stated that he was reluctant to take up this offer as he described the existing films as &quot;perfect films&quot;, though he would be interested in re-creating scenes from the films in a deep-fake homage video or short film.

<doc id="213293" wikidata="Q432327" url="?curid=213293" title="Clark's grebe">
<text>Clark&#x27;s grebe (Aechmophorus clarkii) is a North American waterbird species in the grebe family. Until the 1980s, it was thought to be a pale morph of the western grebe, which it resembles in size, range, and behavior. Intermediates between the two species are known.

This species nests on large inland lakes in western North America and migrates to the Pacific coast over the winter. It maintains local populations year-round in California, Nevada, and Arizona (the Lower Colorado River Valley), as well as in central Mexico. 
It feeds by diving for insects, polychaete worms, crustaceans, and salamanders.

It performs the same elaborate courtship display as the western grebe.

==Etymology and common names==
The &quot;Clark&quot; of its common name—and its specific epithet &quot;clarkii&quot;—honors John Henry Clark, a 19th-century American surveyor who was also a naturalist and collector. The genus name &quot;Aechmophorus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek words αἰχμά (transliterated &quot;aichme&quot;), meaning &#x27;point of a spear&#x27;, and (&quot;phoros&quot;), meaning &#x27;bearing&#x27;; together translating as &#x27;spear point bearer&#x27; and referring to the bird&#x27;s long, dagger-like beak.

In Mexico, it is called achichilique pico naranja (the western grebe is called the &quot;achichilique pico amarillo&quot;). A common name advocated in Spain for this bird is the calque achichilique de Clark.

==Description==

Clark&#x27;s grebe closely resembles the western grebe and occurs in the same colonies together with it. Storer and Nuechterlein in 1992, following earlier morphological studies by Storer and others, define the species as being distinguished from the western grebe by an overall paler plumage on its back, as well as a larger portion of its face covered in white, as it extends above the eyes, rather than just below them. A distinguishing feature is its bill, which is bright yellow in the US, whereas the Western Grebe&#x27;s bill is greenish-yellow in the US, which had been noted by others. Storer and Nuechterlein in 1992 claim that the bill is slightly upturned in this species whereas the western grebe has a straight bill, this was not noted in earlier studies.

The grebe has a long, slender neck and the species ranges in size from , with a wingspan of . Clarks&#x27; grebe has a weight range of .

There are few changes between the sexes, the most notable feature that distinguishes males from females is the presence of a slight crest on the heads of males. In juveniles, the plumage is again similar to the Western Grebe, however it is also paler compared to the greyer Western species.

Its relative size compared to the western grebe is confused. Dickerman showed that grebes from the south of the range were smaller than northern examples, irrespective of which color morph, with both morphs being the same size depending on location, and Dickerman originally reinstated the name &quot;A. clarkii&quot; in 1963 for the smaller, southern populations (irrespective of which color morph). Studies by Storer, Ratti, Mayr and Short in the 1960–70s did not find any size differences between morphs. Nonetheless, some publications now state the paler-coloured grebes are slightly smaller, which might be due to confusion with the species concept advocated by Dickerman (in which Clark&#x27;s grebe doesn&#x27;t not occur in the USA or Canada, pale-coloured grebes in the US and Canada are western grebes, and dark-colored morphs in Mexico are Clark&#x27;s grebe).

Although darker and lighter-colored morphs of grebes occur in the resident non-migratory populations occur in Mexico, it is unclear if these can be distinguished by the other morphological characteristics described above, as most studies have only looked at US populations. Lighter-colored morphs in Mexico are said to have orange-coloured bills, and the darker morphs have yellow bills. In the winter in California numerous examples of dark-colored western grebes displayed the mostly white face of Clark&#x27;s grebe, although this was intermediate and thought to be possibly due to seasonal changes.

==Taxonomy==
Clark&#x27;s grebe (&quot;Aechmophorus clarkii&quot;) is a waterbird of the family Podicipedidae in the order Podicipediformes, which are related to flamingos.

=== History ===
This taxon is extremely similar to the western grebe: it has the same behaviour, including the elaborate courtship displays, occurs sympatrically in the same range and has the same migrations, and is morphologically almost alike, with this bird most noticeably being somewhat paler in colouration. The two taxa can even successfully cross-breed, with intermediates as a result. As such, it was commonly thought to be a paler-colored morph (a version with paler colours and more white), as occurs in many bird species.

In 1858, the lighter-coloured morph had first been described as a separate Mexican and Californian species, &quot;Podiceps clarkii&quot; by George N. Lawrence. Lawrence cited three specimens as representative of his new species, but did not cite a specific holotype. Of the three specimens Lawrence used, two were larger, migratory birds from California, whereas a single specimen was a smaller bird from Laguna Santa Maria in Chihuahua. Deignan designated this last specimen as the holotype in 1961.

After the presence of this taxon throughout the range of the western grebe was discovered, along with the identical behaviour, the two taxa were synonymised, and this situation was accepted by ornithologists throughout the first half of the 20th century.

According to Robert W. Storer, in 1965, besides the paler coloration, there were other more subtle morphological differences between the two taxa: the bill of the western grebe is greenish-yellow, whereas this grebe has a bright yellow bill, and furthermore the black color of the crown extends less far down for this grebe, with the black extending below the eye, the lores and the thin line of bare skin extending from the eye to the corner of the bill in the case of the western grebe, whereas in this grebe the black reaches somewhat less far, leaving a thin line of paler color above the eye. Subsequent studies also showed the frequency of lighter morphs appeared more common in the south of the range than in the north, being relatively common in Mexico according to studies by Dickerman in 1973, but rare in Canada according to Nero (1962) and Storer (1965).

Dickerman in 1963 was the first to cast doubt on the taxonomic status of the taxon, believing that the synonymy was incorrect, and thus he moved Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Podiceps clarkii&quot; to &quot;Aechmophorus clarkii&quot;, and restricted the distribution of this taxon to Mexico, rejecting Lawrence&#x27;s identification of the larger-sized, pale-colored birds from California and elsewhere in the US and Canada as this taxon. His studies showed that there was little overlap in size measurements between Mexican and northern populations -irrespective of coloration; as such Dickerman&#x27;s 1963 view was that &quot;A. clarkii&quot; are smaller grebes restricted to Mexico, which might be found in either light or dark morphs, and &quot;A. occidentalis&quot; are larger-sized, migratory grebes from the US and Canada also found in two colour morphs.
A study in 1979 based on late 1970s observations of pairs the birds courting or nesting, however, noted that the frequency with which two different colour morphs were seen together or were found nesting together was much lower than one would expect if the pairings were random, some reproductive isolating mechanism was keeping the taxa separate. It also found that although the birds inhabited the same wetlands and the same habitats, the populations were not randomly distributed, with the taxa preferentially nesting with their own morph, and colonies being in large part of one type or the other, despite that one morph was much rarer in frequency than the other. There was also a marked difference in reproductive success in the study area, with Clark&#x27;s grebe being initially quite low in frequency at around 12%, but increasing to a third of the population of both taxa in a three-year period. The study used the black coloration of the crown to distinguish the two taxa, but it was noted that some grebes in California in the winter appeared to be the dark morph, but that the black of the crown reached less far -the lores being whitish, confusing this distinguishing feature.

In 1986, Dickerman, accepting a taxonomically significant difference between the two colour morphs, described the taxa &quot;A. occidentalis&quot; ssp. &quot;ephemeralis&quot; for the smaller Western grebes of southern Mexico, and &quot;A. clarkii&quot; ssp. &quot;transitionalis&quot; for the larger migratory North American Clark&#x27;s grebe subspecies sympatric with the nominate Western grebe subspecies. In this view, the nominate form of &quot;A. clarkii&quot; constituted smallish, pale-colored grebes from Mexico.

By 1992, Storer and Gary L. Nuechterlein, both having studied the grebes in the 1970s, recognised the paler-coloured morphs in the US and Canada in the book &quot;The Birds of North America&quot; as &quot;A. clarkii&quot;, thus apparently rejecting Dickerman&#x27;s species concept and subspecific classification, although they do not explicitly state this, and because this work does not include Mexico as part of North America, his work is not actually in their remit. Because of this, it is unclear if they consider the dark-coloured grebes of Mexico to be a morph of Clark&#x27;s grebes, or to be smaller forms of western grebes.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subtaxa of grebe classified as subspecies of &quot;Aechmophorus clarkii&quot; were recognised in 1986:

*&quot;A. c.&quot; ssp. &quot;clarkii&quot;, - Smaller subspecies comparable to the sympatric subspecies of Western Grebe (&quot;A. occidentalis ephemeralis&quot;) from north &amp; central Mexico. Nominate.
*&quot;A. c.&quot; ssp. &quot;transitionalis&quot;, - Larger than nominate &quot;clarkii&quot;, from Western North America between southeast Alaska south to north Mexico. 

==Habitat and distribution==
===Habitat===
Being waterbirds, they require bodies of water that offer the necessary food and shelter that they need to thrive—usually lakes or suitable wetlands—that are also in proximity to suitable tree cover that they can use for nesting.

===Distribution===
Clark&#x27;s grebes occur seasonally throughout the majority of Western America, with a distribution ranging as far south as Mexico, and reaching as far north as British Columbia and Saskatchewan. They avoid the cold and are only found in central USA and Canada during the summer breeding season. In the US and Canada breeding is done across a large portion of the west of these two countries, spanning from British Columbia to Texas, for which the grebes tend to favour larger bodies of water and congregate in large flocks.

Storer and Nuechterlein in 1992 dubiously claim the birds winter in Central America, as well as in Mexico and some regions of California. Out of almost 100,000 records of this taxon logged at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility there are zero records found south of northern Oaxaca, Mexico.

The range of this bird in Mexico is distributed in two streaks southward; one from the California border along the Pacific coast throughout Baja California and across the gulf along the coast to southern Sonora, the other a higher altitude, inland distribution running down from the Big Bend region behind the Texas border down the mountains of central Mexico, with the highest concentration in population in the south from Jalisco to Puebla and northern Oaxaca, where the distribution abruptly ceases. These two distributional areas representing where grebes have ever been seen only meet each other in the very north of Mexico in a strip along the USA border, to the south they do not come together and are separated by a very large distance. It is completely absent from the Atlantic coast.

==Behaviour==

===Vocalizations===
The calls of Clark&#x27;s grebe are similar to its western counterpart, however, during courtship the birds make an &#x27;advertising call&#x27; to attract mates -this sounds like a single, extended &quot;kreeeed&quot; as opposed to the two-note &quot;kreed-kreet&quot; of the western grebe. The calls of the grebe tend to vary very little between sexes.

===Diet===
Thought to be a fish specialist in the early 20th century as a result of the examination of their pellets and stomach contents, it was shown by 1962 that Clark&#x27;s grebe is actually an opportunist when it comes to the food it eats, and is less picky with its selection than previously imagined. This means that the species will actually consume a wide variety of things such as salamanders, crustaceans, polychaete worms and insects while diving and foraging for their preferred small fish, so long as they fit the size constraints of the bill.

===Reproduction===
Clark&#x27;s grebes appear to have semi-monogamous behavior, staying with a single mate, but possibly only for a single season as far as known. Unpaired males far outnumber the females. Males, while they stay with their mate until at least a few weeks after the hatching of their young, will have several sexual partners in their lifetime. It is less known if pairs will eventually mate again in the future. There are two courtship ceremonies that are performed before selection and mating take place: the &quot;rushing ceremony&quot; and the &quot;weed ceremony&quot;. They entail a sequence of performances and advertisements/dances with the partner, or presenting the partner with a bundle of weeds and performing a different set of dances, respectively. As there are fewer females than males, the final decision of whether or not mating occurs depends on the females. Therefore, there is a level of sexual selection within the species. These courtships take place during spring migration and shortly after arriving on the breeding grounds.

It is important to note that while there are very few cases of breeding between clark&#x27;s and western grebes, there have been cases where phenotypic hybrids (birds with plumage that is similar to both species) have mated and produced fertile offspring. It is believed, however, that this becomes less likely when the individuals are from different migrations and are not hybrids, as they have a greater chance of failing during the courtships.

<text>Deep End was a short-lived supergroup founded by guitarist Pete Townshend of the Who and featuring David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. The group also included drummer Simon Phillips, bassist Chucho Merchan, percussionist Jody Linscott, keyboardist John &#x27;Rabbit&#x27; Bundrick, harmonica player Peter Hope Evans, vocalists Billy Nicholls, Cleveland Watkiss, Chyna, and a brass ensemble called the Kick Horns.

==Performance history==
In 1985, the group performed two concerts for the Double O charity at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy (a third was cancelled due to poor ticket sales). The concerts were later released as the albums &quot;Deep End Live!&quot; (1986) and &quot;&quot; (2004). The band also performed a concert at the MIDEM trade fair in France and appeared on &quot;The Tube&quot;. Townshend&#x27;s daughter Emma performed as a guest vocalist at the London concerts.

Many of the same musicians and vocalists also appeared with Townshend for later tours and performances and also with the Who for selected engagements.

In August 2016, it was announced that a Deep End appearance on the German television show &quot;Rockpalast&quot; from 1986 would be released on CD and DVD.

<text>Shaoshan () is a county-level city in Hunan Province, China. It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Xiangtan. Qingxi Town is its seat.

Located on the mid-eastern Hunan and the mid-north of Xiangtan, Shaoshan is bordered by Ningxiang County to the north, Xiangxiang City to the west and southwest, Xiangtan County to the east and southeast. It covers an area of , as of 2015, it has a census registered population of 118,236 and a permanent resident population of 97,800. It is the smallest administrative unit by size or by population in the counties and county-level cities in Hunan province.

As the birthplace of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Shaoshan was an important base during the Chinese Communist Revolution. Mao remains a popular figure in the area, and red tourism to Shaoshan and other places related to China&#x27;s communist background has driven the local economy, while increasing people&#x27;s understanding of China&#x27;s revolutionary history.

==History==
Shaoshan&#x27;s founding legend involves Emperor Shun, who supposedly passed through the site during his southward inspection. He was so fascinated with the landscape that he played the Music of Shao (), which summoned many phoenixes and other birds to accompany him. Thus was Shaoshan named for the Music of Shao. It was under the jurisdiction of the state of Chu in the ancient times.

On December 26, 1990, Shaoshan became a county-level city approved by the State Council.

Names and administrative levels of Shaoshan:
* 1652 (Qing Dynasty): Qidu (), Xiangtan District ()
* 1912 (Republic of China): The Second District (), Xi Township (), Xiangtan County
* December 1932: The Ninth District, Xiangtan County
* 1947: Qingtian Township, Xiangtan County (&quot;de jure&quot;)
* January 1950 (People&#x27;s Republic of China): The Third District, Xiangtan County
* 1951: The Fourth District, Xiangtan County
* August 1, 1955: Yintian District, Xiangtan County
* 1956: Yintian Town, Xiangtan County
* September 1, 1958: Shaoshan People&#x27;s Commune, Xiangtan County
* May 12, 1961: Shaoshan District, Xiangtan County
* December 1968: county-controlled district status upgraded to regional district (), controlled directly by the province
* December 1981: reverted to be county-controlled
* December 1984: upgraded to county-class district (), controlled by Xiangtan City
* December 26, 1990: Upgraded to county-class city, controlled by Xiangtan City on behalf of the province.

==Administrative divisions==
After an adjustment of subdistrict divisions of Shaoshan City on 16 November 2015, Shaoshan City has two towns and two townships under its jurisdiction. they are:
;2 towns
* Qingxi, Shaoshan (): Yongyi, Ruyi and the former Qingxi merged
* Yintian, Shaoshan ()
;2 townships
* Shaoshan Township (): Daping and the former Shaoshan Township merged
* Yanglin, Shaoshan ()

==Description==
Population: the city consists of 100,000 residents, of which 16,000 are non-farmers. The total land area is .

Geography: in the east-central hilly region of Hunan province, the geographical coordinates are longitude 112 ° 23&#x27;52 &quot;-112 ° 38&#x27;13&quot;, latitude 27 ° 51&#x27;40 &quot;-28 ° 1&#x27;53&quot;.

Shaoshan&#x27;s topography is dominated by Mt. Shaofeng and the Shao and Shishi Rivers, with hills in the west giving rise to a mix of hills and plains in the east. The peak of Mount Shaofeng, 518.5 m above sea level, is the highest point whereas Liumuzhou, 48 m above sea level, is the lowest point of the whole city.

<text>Bufo is a genus of true toads in the amphibian family Bufonidae. As traditionally defined, it was a wastebasket genus containing a large number of toads from much of the world but following taxonomic reviews most of these have been moved to other genera, leaving only seventeen extant species from Europe, northern Africa and Asia in this genus, including the well-known common toad (&quot;B. bufo&quot;). Some of the genera that contain species formerly placed in &quot;Bufo&quot; are &quot;Anaxyrus&quot; (many North American species), &quot;Bufotes&quot; (European green toad and relatives), &quot;Duttaphrynus&quot; (many Asian species, including the Asian common toad introduced elsewhere), &quot;Epidalea&quot; (natterjack toad) and &quot;Rhinella&quot; (many Latin American species, including the cane toad introduced elsewhere).

== Description ==
True toads have in common stocky figures and short legs, which make them relatively poor jumpers. Their dry skin is thick and &quot;warty&quot;.

Behind their eyes, &quot;Bufo&quot; species have wart-like structures, the parotoid glands. These glands distinguish the true toads from all other tailless amphibians. They secrete a fatty, white poisonous substance which acts as a deterrent to predators. Contrary to folk belief, handling toads does not cause warts, however due to the poison they secrete, and bacteria on their skins, a person should wash their hands thoroughly after handling one. The poison of most if not all toads contains bufotoxin.

== Species ==
Formerly, the genus &quot;Bufo&quot; encompassed many species and was divided into several subgenera. Frost et al. (2006) removed most of the species of former &quot;Bufo&quot; to other genera and restricted the name &quot;Bufo&quot; to members of the &quot;Bufo bufo&quot; group of earlier authors. Now, this genus has been reduced to 24 extant species:

<text>Tomás de Torquemada (14 October 1420 – 16 September 1498), also anglicized as Thomas of Torquemada, was a Roman Catholic Dominican friar and first Castillian Grand Inquisitor of the Tribunal of the Holy Office, which was a group of ecclesiastical prelates created in 1478 and charged with the somewhat ill-defined task of &quot;upholding Catholic religious orthodoxy&quot; within the lands of the newly formed union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon, presently known as the Kingdom of Spain. 

In part because of persecution, Muslims and Jews in Castile and Aragon at that time found it socially, politically, and economically advantageous to convert to Catholicism (see &quot;Converso&quot;, Morisco, and Marrano). The existence of superficial converts from Judaism (i.e., Crypto-Jews) was perceived by the Catholic Monarchs as a threat to the religious and social life in their realms. This led Torquemada, who himself was believed to have had &quot;converso&quot; ancestors, to be one of the chief supporters of the Alhambra Decree that expelled the Jews from the Crowns of Castile and Aragon in 1492.

Owing to the Inquisition&#x27;s use of torture to extract confessions and burning at the stake of those declared guilty, and to Torquemada&#x27;s own approval, even advocacy, of these practices, his name has become synonymous with cruelty, religious intolerance, and fanaticism. The number of burnings at the stake during Torquemada&#x27;s tenure has been estimated at 2,000.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Torquemada was born on 14 October 1420 either in Valladolid, in the Kingdom of Castile, or in the nearby village of Torquemada. The 15th century chronicler Hernando del Pulgar, a contemporary to de Torquemada and himself a , recorded that Tomás de Torquemada&#x27;s uncle, Juan de Torquemada, a celebrated theologian and cardinal, was of converso descent. As a &quot;converso&quot;, Pulgar is considered to have made this assertion out of hate for Juan de Torquemada&#x27;s nephew, Tomás de Torquemada. However, a 2020 study of all of Juan de Torquemada&#x27;s ancestors found no Jewish converts in his family.

Torquemada entered the local San Pablo Dominican monastery at a very young age. As a zealous advocate of church orthodoxy, he earned a solid reputation for learning, piety, and austerity. As a result, he was promoted to Prior of the monastery of Santa Cruz at Segovia. Around this time, he met the young Princess Isabella I, and the two immediately established religious and ideological rapport. For a number of years, Torquemada served as her regular confessor and personal advisor. He was present at Isabella&#x27;s coronation in 1474, remained her closest ally and supporter, and even advised her to marry King Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469 to consolidate their kingdoms and form a power base he could draw on for his own purposes. Torquemada subdued Ferdinand&#x27;s own ambitions and became his confessor also.

===Establishment of the Holy Office of the Inquisition===
Torquemada deeply suspected the Marrano and Morisco as a menace to Spain&#x27;s welfare by both their increasing religious influence and their economic power in Spain. The Crown of Aragon had Dominican inquisitors almost continuously throughout much of the 14th and the 15th centuries. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella petitioned Pope Sixtus IV to grant their request for a Holy Office to administer an inquisition in Spain. The Pope granted their request and established the Holy Office for the Propagation of the Faith in late 1478.

The papal bull gave the sovereigns full powers to name inquisitors. Rome retained the right to formally appoint the royal nominees. Henry Charles Lea observed that the Spanish Inquisition in both Castile and Aragon remained firmly under Ferdinand&#x27;s direction throughout the joint reign.

===Grand Inquisitor===
The Pope went on to appoint a number of inquisitors for the Spanish Kingdoms in early 1482, including Torquemada. A year later he was named Grand Inquisitor of Spain, which he remained until his death in 1498. In 1484, Torquemada relinquished his role as royal confessor to Diego Deza, a Dominican who would eventually succeed him as Grand Inquisitor. The following year, at a general assembly in Seville, Torquemada promulgated the twenty-eight articles of faith that would be used to guide the inquisitors&#x27; investigations.

In the fifteen years under his direction, the Spanish Inquisition grew from a single tribunal at Seville to a network of two dozen Holy Offices. As Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada reorganized the Spanish Inquisition (originally based in Castile in 1478), establishing tribunals in Sevilla, Jaén, Córdoba, Ciudad Real and (later) Saragossa. His quest was to rid Spain of heresy. The Spanish chronicler Sebastián de Olmedo called him &quot;the hammer of heretics, the light of Spain, the savior of his country, the honor of his order&quot;.

Under the Alhambra Decree of March 31, 1492, approximately 40,000 Jews were expelled from Spain with only their personal possessions. Approximately 50,000 other Jews received Christian baptism to remain in Spain. Many of them, derogatorily dubbed &quot;Marranos&quot; by the Old Christian majority, secretly kept some of their Jewish traditions. They were among the chief targets of the Inquisition, but it also pursued anyone who criticized it.

So many clemency petitions were sent to Rome that the Pope became aware of Torquemada&#x27;s severity, and he called the Inquisition&#x27;s representatives to Rome three times. In addition, Isabella and Ferdinand were so concerned at the quantity of money that was being diverted to the Holy Office that they too protested to the Pope. But Torquemada&#x27;s power kept him in his position until at least 1494.

There are various estimates of the number of victims of the Spanish Inquisition during Torquemada&#x27;s reign as Grand Inquisitor. Hernando del Pulgar, Queen Isabella&#x27;s secretary, wrote that 2,000 executions took place throughout the entirety of her reign, which extended well beyond Torquemada&#x27;s death.

===Death===
During his final years, Torquemada&#x27;s failing health caused Pope Alexander VI to appoint four assistant inquisitors in June 1494 to assist Torquemada with the administration of the Inquisition. While officially, this papal appointment of assistants appeared to be due to Torquemada&#x27;s &#x27;failing health&#x27;, many historians believe that the numerous complaints reaching the Pope about Torquemada&#x27;s relentless zeal may have been the true cause for this papal appointment of &#x27;assistant inquisitors&#x27;. With his faith in his mission undiminished, but stripped of any real power, Torquemada retired to the monastery of St. Thomas Aquinas in Ávila in 1494, typically leaving the monastery only to attend to the royal family, and once again living the simple life of a friar. In 1498, still holding the office of Grand Inquisitor, he held his last general assembly, where new rules were formulated to assure the continuation of the Inquisition in Spain. These rules attempted to curb some of the administrative abuses for which complaints had been lodged against the Inquisition. After fifteen years as Spain&#x27;s Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada died in the monastery on 16 September 1498 and was interred there. His tomb was ransacked in 1832, only two years before the Inquisition was finally disbanded. His bones were allegedly stolen and ritually incinerated in the same manner as an &quot;auto-da-fé&quot;.

<doc id="213304" wikidata="Q2607269" url="?curid=213304" title="Holy Child of La Guardia">
<text>The Holy Child of La Guardia () is a folk saint in Spanish Roman Catholicism and the subject of a medieval blood libel in the town of La Guardia in the central Spanish province of Toledo (Castile–La Mancha).

On 16 November 1491 an auto-da-fé was held outside of Ávila that ended in the public execution of several Jews and conversos. The suspects had confessed under torture to murdering a child. Among the executed were Benito García, the converso who initially confessed to the murder. However, no body was ever found and there is no evidence that a child disappeared or was killed; because of contradictory confessions, the court had trouble coherently depicting how events possibly took place. The child&#x27;s very existence is also disputed.

Like Pedro de Arbués, the Holy Infant was quickly made into a saint by popular acclaim, and his death greatly assisted the Spanish Inquisition and its Inquisitor General, Tomás de Torquemada, in their campaign against heresy and crypto-Judaism. The cult of the Holy Infant is still celebrated in La Guardia.

The Holy Child has been called Spain&#x27;s &quot;most infamous case of blood libel&quot;. The incident took place one year before the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, and the Holy Child was possibly used as a pretext for the expulsion.

In 2015, the Archdiocese of Madrid&#x27;s official website published an article describing the Holy Child as a &quot;martyr&quot; and asserting that the events as described had actually taken place. As of 2023, the article is still online.

==Background==
During the Middle Ages there were frequent blood libels leveled in Spain against the Jews, and the Seven Part Code of Castile (13th century) echoed this popular belief:
And because we have heard it said that in some places Jews celebrated, and still celebrate Good Friday, which commemorates the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, by way of contempt: stealing children and fastening them to crosses, and making images of wax and crucifying them, when they cannot obtain children; we order that, hereafter, if in any part of our dominions anything like this is done, and can be proved, all persons who were present when the act was committed shall be seized, arrested and brought before the king; and after the king ascertains that they are guilty, he shall cause them to be put to death in a disgraceful manner, no matter how many there may be. (Alfonso X the Wise, &quot;Partidas&quot;, VII, XXIV, Law 2)
Certainly several such episodes were believed to have taken place in Spain. One of the best known was the alleged crucifixion of Little Saint Domingo of Val in Zaragoza in the 13th century, as well as the Boy of Sepúlveda in 1468. This last incident resulted not only in the execution of sixteen Jews found guilty of the crime but also resulted in a mob attack on the Jewish community (aljama) in Sepúlveda, which claimed more lives.

There is no evidence that any of these murders or related crimes took place. The accusations and consequent punishments of those accused are understood today to be examples of anti-Semitism.

==Accusation and trial==
Until 1887 the story was known through the legend and in the trial papers deposited in the National Archives of Spain. In that year, the Spanish historian Fidel Fita published an account of the trial of Yucef Franco, one of the accused, in the &quot;Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia&quot;, from the trial papers he had discovered in the Archive. It is one of the most complete accounts of a Spanish Inquisition trial extant.

In June 1490, a roving cloth carder, a converso named Benito García, aged 60, a native of the town of La Guardia, was stopped in Astorga in the province of León. A consecrated Host was discovered in his knapsack. He was taken for interrogation before the Vicar-general (Judicial Judge) of the Bishopric of Astorga, Pedro de Villada. The confession of Benito García, dated 6 June 1490, has survived and indicates that he was only accused of Judaizing. The defendant explained that five years earlier (1485) he had secretly returned to the Jewish faith, encouraged by another converso, Juan de Ocaña, who was also from La Guardia, and a Jew from the nearby locality of Tembleque, named Franco.

A Jewish cobbler, Yucef Franco, aged 20, from Tembleque was also mentioned by Benito García and then arrested by the Inquisition on 1 July 1490, along with his father Ça Franco, aged 80. He was in prison in Segovia on 19 July 1490, when he fell ill. He was visited by a doctor, Antonio de Ávila. Yucef asked the doctor if he could see a Rabbi. In place of a Rabbi, on his second visit the doctor was accompanied by a converso Friar, Alonso Enriquez, disguised as a Rabbi and calling himself Abrahán. When asked why he thought he had been arrested, Yucef replied that he was accused of the ritual murder of a Christian boy. The second time he was visited by the two men, Yucef made no further mention of this issue.

Yucef&#x27;s subsequent statements implicated other Jews and conversos. On 27 August 1490 the Grand Inquisitor Tomás de Torquemada issued an indictment ordering the transfer of the prisoners from Segovia to Ávila to await trial. The indictment lists all the prisoners held in Segovia who were related to this case. They were conversos: Alonso Franco, Franco Lope, García Franco, Juan Franco, Juan de Ocaña, and García Benito, residents of La Guardia; and Jews: Yucef Franco of Tembleque, and Moses Abenamías of Zamora. The indictment contained charges of heresy, apostasy, as well as crimes against the Catholic faith. Curiously the indictment does not mention Ça Franco.

The inquisitors in charge of preparing the trial were Pedro de Villado (the same man who had previously interrogated Benito García in June 1490), Juan López de Cigales, Inquisitor of Valencia since 1487, and Friar Fenando de Santo Domingo. All were men who enjoyed the confidence of Torquemada. Santo Domingo had also written the foreword to a published anti-Semitic pamphlet.

The trial against Yucef Franco began on 17 December 1490 and lasted several months. He was accused of trying to attract conversos to Judaism as well as having participated in the ritual crucifixion of a Christian child on Good Friday. It seems that before the trial, Benito García and Yucef Franco, at least, had already partially confessed and given evidence against the others on the promise of obtaining their freedom, but this was a trap laid by the Inquisition.

When the indictment was read out, Yucef Franco shouted out that it was the biggest falsehood in the world. He was appointed Counsel for his defence who petitioned the court that the charges were too vague, no dates of the crime were given, there was no body, and that the victim had not even been named. As a Jew, Yucef could not be guilty of heresy or apostasy. The defense asked for complete acquittal. The petition was overruled by the court and the trial proceeded. The preserved confessions of this defendant, extracted under torture, refer at first only to conversations with Benito García in gaol and incriminate them only as Judaizers, but later start to refer to a piece of witchcraft performed about four years earlier (perhaps 1487), which involved the use of a consecrated host, stolen from a church in La Guardia, and the heart of a Christian boy. Yucef&#x27;s subsequent statements give more details of this topic and are particularly incriminating of Benito García. García&#x27;s statements have also been preserved, and taken &quot;whilst he had been put to the torture&quot; are inconsistent with those of Yucef, and above all serve mainly to incriminate the latter. The inquisitors even arranged a face-to-face confrontation between the two accused, on 12 October 1491, and the judicial records of this meeting state that their depositions were in agreement, which is surprising, as previously they had contradicted each other.

In October 1491, one of the inquisitors, Friar Fernando de San Esteban, travelled to the convent of San Esteban in Salamanca to consult with several legal experts and theologians, who pronounced on the guilt of the accused. In the final phase of the trial, the evidence was made public and Yucef tried unsuccessfully to refute it. The last depositions of Yucef, obtained under torture in November, added more details to the facts; many of them clearly had their origins in anti-Semitic literature.

On 16 November 1491, in the &quot;Brasero de la Dehesa&quot; (lit: &quot;brazier in the meadow&quot;) in Ávila, all of the accused were handed over to the secular authorities and burned at the stake. Nine people were executed - three Jews: Yusef Franco, Ça Franco, and Moses Abenamías; and six conversos: Alonso, Lope, García and Juan Franco, Juan de Ocaña and Benito García. As was customary, the sentences were read out at the auto-da-fé, and those of Yucef Franco and Benito García have been preserved.

Property confiscated from the prisoners was used to finance the construction of the monastery of Santo Tomás de Ávila, which was completed on 3 August 1493.

==Legend==
During the sixteenth century, there arose a legend according to which the death of the Holy Child was similar to that of Jesus Christ, even emphasising similarities between the topography of the Toledan town where the events are said to have occurred (La Guardia), and of Jerusalem where Jesus died.

In 1569, the graduate Sancho Busto de Villegas, a member of the and governor of the Archbishopric of Toledo (afterwards Bishop of Avila) wrote, based on the trial documents, which were stored in the Valladolid court archives, &quot;Relación autorizada del martirio del Santo Inocente&quot; (&quot;Authorized Account of the Martyrdom of Saint Innocent&quot;), which was deposited in the municipal archives of La Guardia town hall. In 1583, Friar Rodrigo de Yepes published &quot;La Historia de la muerte y glorioso martirio del santo inocente que llaman de Laguardia&quot; (&quot;The History of the Death and Glorious Martyrdom of the Holy Innocent said to be from La Guardia&quot;). In 1720 another hagiography appeared in Madrid, &quot;La Historia del Inocente Trinity el Santo Niño de la Guardia&quot; (&quot;The History of the Trinitarian Innocent, the Holy Child of La Guardia&quot;), the work of Diego Martinez Abad, and in 1785, the village priest of La Guardia, Martín Martínez Moreno, published his &quot;Historia del martirio del Santo Niño de la Guardia&quot; (&quot;History of the Martyrdom of the Holy Child of La Guardia&quot;).

The legend constructed on these successive contributions relates that some converts, after attending an auto-da-fé in Toledo, planned revenge on the inquisitors by arts of sorcery. For the spell, they needed a consecrated Host and the heart of an innocent child. Alonso Franco and Juan Franco kidnapped the boy next to la Puerta del Perdón (the door of Forgiveness) in Toledo Cathedral and took him to La Guardia. There on Good Friday, they held a mock trial. The boy, who in the legend is sometimes called Juan and at other times Cristóbal, is said to be the son of Alonso de Pasamonte and Juana la Guindero (even though no body was ever found). Local Christians thought he had been scourged, crowned with thorns and crucified at the mock trial, in imitation of Jesus Christ. The heart, needed for the spell, was torn out. At the exact time of the child&#x27;s death, his mother, who was blind, miraculously regained her sight. After burying the body, the murderers stole a consecrated Host. Benito García set out for Zamora, carrying the Host and the heart to seek the help of other coreligionists to perform his spell, but was stopped in Ávila (a considerable distance from Astorga, which is nowhere near the Toledo/Zamora road) because of the brilliant light that issued from the consecrated Host the convert had hidden between the pages of a prayer-book. Thanks to his confession, the other participants in the crime were discovered. After the death of the Holy Child is said to have occurred, several miraculous healings were attributed to him.

The consecrated Host is kept in the Dominican monastery of St. Thomas in Ávila. The heart was said to have miraculously disappeared, like the child&#x27;s body, and legends arose that like Jesus Christ he had been resurrected.

==In art and literature==

Yepes mentioned that there was an altarpiece, now lost, in the chapel of the Holy Child of La Guardia in the town, which Alonso de Fonseca, archbishop of Toledo, had ordered to be painted, representing the scenes of the abduction, prosecution, scourging and crucifixion of the child, as well as the apprehension and execution of his murderers. The central panel of this altarpiece showed the crucifixion and removal of the child&#x27;s heart.

In the National History Archives in Madrid, there is a painting of the second half of the sixteenth century representing the same scene, which seemingly testifies to the antiquity of the cult of the Holy Child of La Guardia.

There is a mural Bayeu attributed to the representation of the crucifixion of the Holy Child of La Guardia in Toledo cathedral. It can be accessed through the door called &quot;del Mollete&quot;. Currently, the humidity and exposure to inclement weather found in the interior of the cathedral cloister have led to the painting deteriorating.

Lope de Vega&#x27;s play&quot; El niño inocente de La Guardia&quot; (&quot;The Innocent Child of La Guardia&quot;) was possibly inspired by the legend recounted by Fray Rodrigo de Yepes. This work from the Golden Age of Spanish Literature is renowned for its cruelty in the last act, portraying the crucifixion of the child. The scene was imitated by José de Cañizares, author of &quot;La viva imagen de Cristo: El Santo Niño de la Villa de la Guardia&quot; (&quot;The Living Image of Christ: The Holy Child of Villa de la Guardia&quot;).

In one of the legends of Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, called &quot;La Rosa de Pasión&quot; (&quot;The Rose of Passion&quot;), a Jew named Sara, whose boyfriend was a Christian, confronts her father, Daniel, on his hatred of Christians, and dies in a ritual very similar to the Santo Niño de la Guardia (in fact, seeing the preparations, she thinks about the history of the Holy Child).

==Impact==
The impact of the legend had immediate and far-reaching consequences for both the Jewish community in Spain and for the Spanish nobility:

With Torquemada&#x27;s urging, it was used by Isabella I as one of the reasons for the expulsion of the Jews after the fall of Granada in 1492.

Because of the fear that heresy was hereditary, the outcome of this trial involving conversos and Jews, was used to argue for the purity of blood (limpieza de sangre) in those aspiring to join the clergy of the archdiocese of Toledo. Many members of the nobility could not prove their untainted ancestry and thus became ineligible to hold office in the main See of Spain.

<doc id="213306" wikidata="Q2577053" url="?curid=213306" title="Pedro de Arbués">
<text>Pedro de Arbués, also known as &quot;Peter of Arbués&quot; (c. 1441 – 17 September 1485) was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest and a professed Augustinian canon. He served as an official of the Spanish Inquisition until he was assassinated in the La Seo Cathedral in Zaragoza in 1485 by Jews and conversos. The veneration of him came swiftly through popular acclaim. His death greatly assisted the Inquisitor-General Tomás de Torquemada&#x27;s campaign against heretics and crypto-Jews. His canonization was celebrated on 29 June 1867.

==Life==
Pedro de Arbués was born at Épila in the region of Zaragoza to the nobleman Antonio de Arbués and Sancia Ruiz.

He studied philosophy perhaps in Huesca but later travelled to Bologna on a scholarship to the Spanish College of Saint Clement which was part of the Bologna college. He obtained his doctorate in 1473 while he served as a professor of moral philosophical studies or ethics. Upon his return to Spain he became a member of the cathedral chapter of the canons regular at La Seo where he made his religious profession in 1474.

At around that time Ferdinand and Isabella had obtained from Pope Sixtus IV a papal bull to establish in their kingdom a tribunal for searching out heretics, the Inquisition had been first established in Spain in Aragón, 14th century, to counteract the Catharism heresy. Those Jews who had received baptism were known as conversos; some might have continued to practice Judaism in secret, called &#x27;judaizantes&#x27;. Tomás de Torquemada, a Marrano surname, was in 1483 appointed as the Grand Inquisitor for Castile. Espina, confessor of Isabella, was formerly a rabin. Torquemada then appointed Arbués and Pedro Gaspar Juglar as Inquisitors Provincial in the Kingdom of Aragon on 4 May 1484. Their work was opposed by converts and people who saw it as a threat to their freedoms.

On 14 September 1485 Pedro was attacked in the cathedral as he knelt before the altar and had been wearing armour since he knew his work posed great risks. Despite wearing a helmet and chain mail under the tunic he died from his wounds on 17 September. His remains were entombed in a special chapel dedicated to him.

The Inquisition was unpopular in Aragon as it was seen as a Castilian attack on the charters, privileges and local laws. The most powerful families among the converted Jews: the Sánchez, Montesa, Abadía (AbdYah), Paterno and Santangel families seem to have been involved in funding the murder.

As a result, a popular movement against the Jews arose in which nine were executed, two killed themselves, thirteen were burnt in effigy, and four punished for complicity, from 30 June to 15 December 1486, according to the historian Jerónimo Zurita. Leonardo Sciascia in &quot;Morte dell&#x27;inquisitore&quot; (1964) writes (erroneously) that Arbués along with Juan Lopez de Cisneros (d. 1657) are &quot;the only two cases of inquisitors who died assassinated&quot;.

==Sainthood==
Pope Alexander VII beatified Pedro de Arbués in Rome on 20 April 1664. His canonization was celebrated on 29 June 1867 among protests from Jews and Christians. Pope Pius IX said in the document formalizing the canonization &quot;(Maiorem caritatem)&quot;: &quot;The divine wisdom has arranged that in these sad days, when Jews help the enemies of the church with their books and money, this decree of sanctity has been brought to fulfillment&quot;.

<text>Fledging is the stage in a flying animal&#x27;s life between hatching or birth and becoming capable of flight.
This term is most frequently applied to birds, but is also used for bats. For altricial birds, those that spend more time in vulnerable condition in the nest, the nestling and fledging stage can be the same. For precocial birds, those that develop and leave the nest quickly, a short nestling stage precedes a longer fledging stage.

All birds are considered to have fledged when the feathers and wing muscles are sufficiently developed for flight. A young bird that has recently fledged but is still dependent upon parental care and feeding is called a fledgling. People often want to help fledglings, as they appear vulnerable, but it is best to leave them alone. The USA National Phenology Network defines the phenophase (or life cycle stage) of fledged young for birds as &quot;One or more young are seen recently departed from the nest. This includes young incapable of sustained flight and young which are still dependent on adults.&quot;

In many species, parents continue to care for their fledged young, either by leading them to food sources, or feeding them. Birds are vulnerable after they have left the nest, but before they can fly, though once fledged their chances of survival increase dramatically.

One species, the ancient murrelet, fledges two days after hatching, running from its burrow to the ocean and its calling parents. Once it reaches the ocean, its parents care for it for several weeks. Other species, such as guillemots and terns, leave the nesting site while they are still unable to fly. The fledging behavior of the guillemot is spectacular; the adult leads the chick to the edge of the cliff, where the colony is located, and the chick will then launch itself off, attempting to fly as far as possible, before crash landing on the ocean.

<text>Aldabra, the world&#x27;s second-largest coral atoll (the largest is Kiritimati), is located east of the continent of Africa. It is part of the Aldabra Group of islands in the Indian Ocean that are part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, with a distance of 1,120 km (700 mi) southwest of the capital, Victoria on Mahé Island. Initially named by Arab seafarers for its harsh environment, Aldabra became a French colony dependency in the 18th century, leading to the exploitation of its natural resources, particularly giant tortoises. After passing through British hands, Aldabra faced potential military use in the 1960s, but international protests resulted in its protection. The atoll boasts unique geography, featuring the world&#x27;s largest raised coral reef and a large shallow lagoon. Aldabra&#x27;s history involves human impact, including failed agricultural ventures. 

Post-World War II, conservation efforts increased, leading to its inclusion in the British Indian Ocean Territory and eventual independence for Seychelles. Following an international protest by scientists known as the &#x27;Aldabra Affair,&#x27; the Royal Society of London and later the Seychelles Islands Foundation conducted research, leading to Aldabra&#x27;s declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The atoll&#x27;s flora and fauna, notably the giant tortoises, comprise an &#x27;ecological wonder&#x27;, with Aldabra serving as a critical breeding ground for various species. Conservation challenges, such as invasive species and plastic pollution, persist, but protective measures, including UNESCO designation, underscore Aldabra&#x27;s significance as a natural vital scientific research site. Aldabra receives limited tourism to safeguard its delicate ecosystem and is accessible primarily through guided tours.

==History==

The name Aldabra, originally Al-Hadra or Al-Khadra (with several variants), was given by Arab seafarers for &quot;the atoll’s harsh, sun-baked environment&quot;; this name was included in the Portuguese maps of the 16th century. The islands were already known to the Persians and Arabs, from whom they got their name. They had named the Indian Ocean as Bahr-el zanj. It was visited by Portuguese navigators in 1511. In the middle of the 18th century, the atoll became a dependency of the French colony of Réunion, from where expeditions were made for the capture of the Aldabra giant tortoises.

As there are no surface freshwater sources on Aldabra, the interests of the explorers (no proof of any European explorer&#x27;s visit prior to 1742) was only to exploit the species of tortoise, turtle and fish, and not to inhabit the atoll. In 1810, with Mauritius, Réunion, the Seychelles and other islands, Aldabra passed into the possession of Great Britain. Réunion was later returned to France, and Mauritius gained possession of Aldabra as well as the rest of the Seychelles. The previous inhabitants were emigrants from the Seychelles.

Admiral W. J. L. Wharton of the British Navy landed in Aldabra in 1878 to conduct hydrographic surveys of the islands. In 1888, the first settlement was established after the Concession was granted by the Seychelles authorities. A small settlement was established on Picard Island facing west near the beach. The intention was to exploit and export the natural resources of the islands. The villagers built a chapel, in the middle of the badamier trees, using timber and steel; the chapel was considered an essential addition to the plantation houses and office buildings. As Aldabra had no freshwater resources, large rectangular-shaped water storage structures were built adjoining each building. A two-roomed jail was also built in the village, a remnant of which is extant.

The exploitation of tortoises for commercial purposes at that time is illustrated by the remnants of a crushing mill at Picard Island, which was used to crush bones of tortoises, which were also brought in from other islands in the atoll. Efforts made to grow plantation crops of coconuts, cotton, and sisal failed due to inadequate water sources on the atoll; relics of these plantations are still found on some of the islands. In the late 19th century, goats were introduced as a food source for the villagers (about 200) living there. Ship rats were inadvertently introduced and recorded before 1870, and house geckos were noted from the 1970s. Sailors landed on the atoll in the 19th century and captured tortoises as food; in 1842, two ships were reported to have taken 1200 of them. By 1900, the tortoises were nearly extinct, and a crew would often have to hunt for three days to find one.

In the early 1800s, concessions given to individuals almost destroyed the forests and tortoise habitats in many islands in Seychelles; on Aldabra Atoll, in view of its remoteness and rugged topography, only small areas of forests were cleared for agricultural operations (mostly coconut plantations) but the tortoises were intensely captured for meat and trade. However, James Spurs, who had the concession of the atoll, was responsible initially for saving the tortoises on the atoll when he banned killing them in 1891.

Following World War II, exploitation of Aldabra for commercial use came to an end and restrictions were even imposed on the number of people who could stay on the islands; this number was fixed at 200 at a time. Introduction of invasive species was banned, faunal species were protected under law, and active research on the ecology and biodiversity of the atoll was undertaken by the Royal Society of London from the mid-1970s.

Aldabra, along with Desroches and Farquhar, was part of the British Indian Ocean Territory from 1965 until Seychelles&#x27; independence in 1976. In the 1960s, as a part of their &#x27;Ocean Island Policy&#x27;, and to support East of Suez commitments, the British government considered establishing an RAF base on the island and invited the United States to help fund the project in return for shared use of the facility and a settlement of 11 million dollars. Simultaneously (mid-1960s), the British Broadcasting Corporation became interested in Aldabra as a possible transmitter site, to broadcast the BBC Overseas Service (BBC) into the African mainland. The BBC mounted a fact-finding expedition (Expedition Turtle) to assess its suitability for this purpose. The BBC relied on the RAF for developing the atoll as without this their project would not have been feasible.

After an international protest by scientists (known as &#x27;the Aldabra Affair&#x27;), however, the military plans were abandoned and the atoll instead received full protection. The &quot;Environmental lobbyists&quot; under the leadership of Julian Huxley, with the support of MPs Tam Dalyell and Robin Cook, got the British venture torpedoed. In 1966, British Defence Minister Denis Healey had observed: &quot;As I understand it, the island of Aldabra is inhabited - like Her Majesty&#x27;s Opposition Front bench - by giant turtles, frigate birds and boobies.&quot;

Subsequent to the thwarting of plans to establish a military station at Aldabra (which instead focused on Diego Garcia in the Chagos Islands), the Royal Society of London resumed their scientific study of the flora and fauna of the atoll with Professor David Stoddart as the leader. The Royal Society bought the lease of the atoll in 1970 and their research station became functional from 1970. After completion of their assigned work, the Royal Society left and the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF), a public trust of Seychelles, assumed management and protection of the atoll in 1979. SIF functions under the patronage of the President of Seychelles and Aldabra was declared a Special Nature Reserve in 1981; it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 19 November 1982. A brass plaque inscribed with the citation &quot;Aldabra, wonder of nature given to humanity by the people of the Republic of Seychelles&quot; was erected on the atoll. This appreciation befits the atoll which is truly one of the greatest ecologically undisturbed raised coral atolls in the world.

==Geography==
Aldabra atoll is in the most southwesterly part of the Seychelles, and is closer to the coast of Africa than to Mahé. It is northwest of Madagascar and from Moroni on the Comoro Islands. The atoll is the largest raised coral reef in the world with an elevation of ; and the second-largest atoll in the world after Kiritimati Atoll. It lies at and belongs to the Aldabra Group, one of the island groups of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, which includes the island of Assumption and the atolls of Astove and Cosmoledo. Aldabra atoll is long (in east–west direction) and wide. It has a large shallow lagoon, in area, which is about two-thirds dry during low tide. The lagoon is encircled by fringing coral reef.

Around the rim of the lagoon are the larger islands of the atoll. The total land area of the atoll is . The size including the lagoon is . The outside rim of the atoll has three passages which connect to the lagoon, which is in width where it opens to the sea. The water depth in the lagoon averages about ; however, the passages that open to the sea are up to deep and strongly affected by tidal currents.

===List of islands===
Aldabra atoll has, besides the four larger islands, some 40 smaller islands and rocks, all inside the lagoon, as well as a few very small islets at the West Channels between Grand Terre Island and Picard Islands, the largest of those being Îlot Magnan.

==Geology==
The atoll reflects both fossil and geomorphological features, the former is the source of the biodiversity seen today. The atoll consists of reef limestone of Pleistocene age (with irregular coral formations called &quot;champignon&quot;, made up of two layers of varying stages of crystallization ) and this extends over an average width of rising to a height of above sea level, and forming the rim line (low cliffs with &quot;deep notches, preceded by jagged pinnacles&quot;) of the shallow central lagoon. Geologically the limestone beds have been subjected to striation, sink holes and pits with prominent and continuous limestone bed on the eastern side above the sediment deposits.

The coastline has undercut limestone cliffs above a perched beach; it is in two clear terraces of and height above sea level. While the terrestrial topography (spread over an elevation range of ) is rugged and dictated by the geomorphic conditions, the land surface comprises limestone of about 125,000 years age, which has uplifted many times above the sea level. The surface conditions are criss-crossed and riddled with pot holes and pits. In the eastern zone of the lagoon, though the surface is continuous, sediment beds are also seen. The windward southern coast is made up of sand dunes.

==Climate and tides==
Aldabra is situated in the dry zone of the south-west Indian Ocean. The northwest monsoon season is from November to March and brings the heaviest rainfall. In the remaining months, the south-easterly trade winds are dominant. Aldabra receives an annual average rainfall of . Cyclones are rare in the Seychelles due to its nearness to the Equator. The reported monthly mean maximum air temperature recorded in December is . The mean minimum temperature recorded in August is .

The hydrodynamics of Aldabra&#x27;s lagoon are dominated by the tides. The maximum tidal range at Aldabra is around 2.7m, which is exceptionally large for an atoll. Flow between the lagoon and open ocean is only possible through a small number of narrow channels, generating tidal currents of over 3 m/s at Passe Gionnet, and over 1 m/s at most other channels. Due to the restriction of water exchange through these channels, tides within the lagoon are lagged compared to the open ocean, and the tidal range varies across the lagoon.

Aldabra sits in the path of the Indian Ocean&#x27;s westward-flowing South Equatorial Current. Eddies are generated in the wake of Aldabra as the South Equatorial Current passes it, driving upwelling of deep waters that bring nutrients to the surface, and drive phytoplankton growth.

==Wildlife==

The earliest study of the flora and fauna, and also the geomorphological structure was in 1910. There are 307 species of animals and plants on Aldabra. Reptiles are the prominent terrestrial fauna. Sir David Attenborough called Aldabra &quot;One of the wonders of the world&quot;, and it is also known as one of &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the Indian Ocean.

===Flora===

The higher areas of Aldabra are covered in &quot;pemphis&quot;, a thick coastal shrub, while the lower areas, home to the giant tortoises, are a mixture of trees, shrubs, herbs and grasses. There have been recorded 273 species of flowering plants, shrubs, and ferns on the atoll. There are dense thickets of &quot;Pemphis acidula&quot;, and a mixture of grasses and herbs called &quot;tortoise turf&quot; in many areas. This flora includes 19 endemic species and 22 species that are only common to neighboring islands, and several of these species are on the IUCN Red List. The tropicbird orchid (&quot;Angraecum seychellarum&quot;) is the national flower of Seychelles and is found in the dry craggy limestone champignon of Aldabra. Other endemic plants includes &quot;Pandanus aldabrensis&quot;, the Aldabra lily (&quot;Aloe aldabrensis&quot;) and a sub-species of tropicbird orchid, &quot;Angraecum eburneum.&quot;

The lagoon is bordered by mangrove forests, and has large inland seagrass meadows as well as areas of coral reef and sand flats. The mangroves, which thrive in tidal mudflat areas and saline conditions, are seen on the shores of the lagoon and are integral to the coastal ecosystem. There are seven species of mangrove on Aldabra, three of which are rarely occurring species. These include &#x27;Mangliye blan&#x27; or white mangrove (&quot;Avicennia marina&quot;) which grows to , &#x27;Mangliye lat&#x27; or black mangrove (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) which grows to in a conical shape, &#x27;Mangliye zonn&#x27; (Ceriops tagal) which grows to with a buttressed trunk, and &#x27;Mangliye rouz&#x27; or red mangrove (&quot;Rhizophora mucronata&quot;) which is the tallest species up to in height.

===Fauna===
The atoll has distinctive fauna including the largest population of giant tortoises (&quot;Aldabrachelys gigantea&quot;) in the world (100,000 animals). Tortoise size varies substantially across the atoll, but adult tortoises typically have a carapace length of and can weigh up to . They are herbivores and feed on plants, trees and algae that grows in the freshwater pools. The tortoises mate between February and May, the females then lay their eggs from June to September in areas with suitable soil layers. They lay eggs the size of golf balls in a clutch of three to five eggs every few years in high-density areas and 14-16 eggs in low-density areas. The females can lay several clutches in a year and the incubation period is 73–160 days. The small vulnerable juveniles are prey to coconut crabs, land crabs, rats and birds. In the past giant tortoises have been relocated to other islands in Seychelles and also to Victoria Botanical Gardens in Mahé. One of the longest-lived Aldabra giant tortoises was Adwaita, a male who died at the age of about 250 years at Kolkata&#x27;s Alipore Zoological Gardens on 24 March 2006.
Aldabra is a breeding ground for the hawksbill sea turtle (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) and green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;). Aldabra has one of the largest populations of nesting green turtles in the Western Indian Ocean. Aldabra has a large population of the world&#x27;s largest terrestrial arthropod, the coconut crab (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;); and hosts the white-throated rail, the only surviving flightless rail species in the Indian Ocean. Sharks, manta rays, and barracuda populate the seas surrounding the island. During the Pleistocene the dominant land predator was the crocodilian &quot;Aldabrachampsus&quot; which is now extinct. Three extant species of lizards occur, the skink &quot;Cryptoblepharus boutonii&quot; and the geckos &quot;Phelsuma abbotti&quot; and &quot;Hemidactylus&quot; &quot;mercatorius&quot;. Pleistocene fossils also indicate the former presence of an &quot;Oplurus&quot; iguana and other skink and gecko species. There are three endemic species of bat from Aldabra: &quot;Paratriaenops pauliani&quot;, &quot;Chaerephon pusilla&quot; and the Aldabra flying fox (&quot;Pteropus aldabrensis&quot;), as well as the more widely distributed Mauritian tomb bat (&quot;Taphozous mauritianus&quot;). There are 1,000 species of insects, many of them endemic. Many species of butterflies also flutter around Aldabra.

Endemic birds include the Aldabra drongo (&quot;Dicrurus aldabranus&quot;), the Aldabran subspecies of the white-throated rail (&quot;Dryolimnas cuvieri aldabranus&quot;), the last surviving flightless bird of the Indian Ocean region, and the endemic Aldabra fody (&quot;Foudia aldabrana&quot;), The islands are important breeding grounds for thousands of seabirds, including several species of tern, red-tailed tropicbirds, white-tailed tropicbirds, red-footed boobies, and the world&#x27;s second largest breeding populations of great and lesser frigate birds. The bird fauna is most similar to Madagascar or Comoros and other birds found here include greater flamingos, the Malagasy pond heron, Comoros blue pigeon, Malagasy kestrel, Malagasy coucal, Madagascar nightjar, Malagasy bulbul and souimanga sunbird.

At least 13 species of cetaceans, including dolphins, orcas, and especially humpback whales, have been identified in the waters. Dugongs, thought to be regionally extinct in the 18th century, have been confirmed multiple times in recent years.

==Conservation==
Conservationists feared a major threat to the atoll&#x27;s biodiversity in the 1960s when, as part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, the British made plans to set up a military establishment on the atoll. Due to national and international opposition this plan was cancelled in 1967. This incident became known as the &#x27;Aldabra Affair&#x27; in England.

Invasive alien species such as rats, cats and goats that were introduced in the past threaten the native biodiversity of the atoll. Goats were eradicated from the atoll in 2012 after a long-term eradication program. Cats have been removed from all of the islands except Grande Terre Island, which allowed for the reintroduction of the Aldabra rail to Picard Island. Research into a feasibility study to eradicate rats from the atoll has been undertaken.

Until recently, Aldabra had remained free of invasive birds. However, the Madagascar fody (&quot;Foudia madagascariensis&quot;) has spread to Aldabra after being introduced to Assumption Island. An eradication program for this bird on both Assumption and Aldabra is almost complete. Due to the limited space of its habitat, extreme weather conditions, epidemic and limited range could also pose serious threats to the entire ecology of the atoll.

Aldabra also accumulates large amounts of plastic pollution on its coastline and, despite a major clean-up effort in 2019, over 500 tonnes is thought to remain on the atoll, with significant impacts on wildlife. Most of this pollution originates from the regional fishing industry, although a significant proportion is also transported from southeast Asia through ocean currents.

The coral reefs at Aldabra were severely affected by the 2016 El Niño event. Although thermal stress was not exceptionally high (less than 4 Degree Heating Weeks), hard coral cover on Aldabra&#x27;s seaward-facing reefs was reduced by over 50% (35% in the lagoon), and soft coral cover fell by over 90%. Fortunately, there are some signs of recovery, as the abundance of juvenile corals has since increased significantly, particularly within the lagoon, although Aldabra&#x27;s reefs of course remain critically threatened by climate change.

==Protection==
Aldabra atoll was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 19 November 1982. It is one of the two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Seychelles;, and is managed by the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF). The marine protected area extends into the sea to ensure preservation of its marine fauna. Eco tourism is controlled and introduction of invasive species is restricted.

Based on the evaluation process, UNESCO inscribed the site, a legally protected special reserve of , on the list of World Heritage Sites under three criteria: Criterion (vii): Aldabra Atoll encompasses a large expanse of relatively untouched natural beauty where a number of important animal species and some plant species thrive, along with remarkable land formations, and its process provides a unique spectacle of natural phenomena; Criterion (ix): The atoll is a superlative example of an oceanic island ecosystem in which evolutionary processes are active within a rich biota. The size and morphological diversity of the atoll has permitted the development of a variety of discrete insular communities with a high incidence of endemicity among the constituent species that are typical of island ecosystems. The natural processes take place with minimal human interference and can be clearly demonstrated in their full complexity; and Criterion (x): Aldabra provides a natural laboratory for the study of the process of evolutionary ecology and is a platform for key scientific discovery. The atoll constitutes a refuge harboring viable populations of a range of rare and endangered species of plants and animals, including the last giant tortoise and flightless bird populations of the Western Indian Ocean, a substantial marine turtle breeding population, and large seabird colonies which number in the tens of thousands. The substantial tortoise population is self-sustaining and all the elements of its inter-relationship with the terrestrial environment are evident.

BirdLife International declared Aldabra as an Important Endemic Bird Area (IBA) in 2001 due to its large seabird colonies under categories A1, A2, A4i, A4ii and A4iii, covering an area of overlapping with the special reserve area of of Aldabra Atoll.

Aldabra became a Ramsar Convention Wetland Site of International Importance in 2010. 
Covering 25,100 ha (over half the area of the whole atoll) the wetland ecosystem of Aldabra includes the extensive shallow lagoon inside the atoll, which is carpeted with lush seagrass beds and patchy coral reefs, the intertidal mud flats, the coral reefs outside the lagoon, freshwater pools, beaches, and 2000 ha of mangrove stands. These wetlands support several endangered species including the increasing number of turtles at the atoll, dugongs and many other bird, fish and invertebrate species.

Aldabra was designated as a site under the Indian Ocean South East Asia (IOSEA) turtle network, in their 2014 convention.

==Demography==
A small scientific research station of the SIF is based in La Gigi village on Picard Island. The permanent staff (currently 12) conduct research to study Aldabra&#x27;s biodiversity.

==Transport==
Aldabra is not easily accessed. No airstrips, helipads or landing jetties have been permitted on the atoll. The nearest airfield is on Assumption is south-east of Picard Island. Bi-annual supply ships operating from Mahé provide essentials to the research station.

==Tourism==
Cruises are operated by several companies along with dive boats which may visit the atoll on expedition tours. Visits to the island by people other than the scientists and staff of the SIF are strictly controlled and only guided tours are provided with prior permission. , a yearly average of 900 tourists visit the atoll. Within the atoll, paved walking paths exist from the village of La Gigi, which leads to a promontory from where scenic views of the large lagoon (during low tides) and the mangrove species are seen.

<doc id="213328" wikidata="Q62527" url="?curid=213328" title="Negative feedback">
<text>Negative feedback (or balancing feedback) occurs when some function of the output of a system, process, or mechanism is fed back in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output, whether caused by changes in the input or by other disturbances. A classic example of negative feedback is a heating system thermostat — when the temperature gets high enough, the heater is turned OFF. When the temperature gets too cold, the heat is turned back ON. In each case the &quot;feedback&quot; generated by the thermostat &quot;negates&quot; the trend.

The opposite tendency — called positive feedback — is when a trend is positively reinforced, creating amplification, such as the squealing &quot;feedback&quot; loop that can occur when a mic is brought too close to a speaker which is amplifying the very sounds the mic is picking up, or the runaway heating and ultimate meltdown of a nuclear reactor which has a positive temperature coefficient of reactivity.

Whereas positive feedback tends to lead to instability via exponential growth, oscillation or chaotic behavior, negative feedback generally promotes stability. Negative feedback tends to promote a settling to equilibrium, and reduces the effects of perturbations. Negative feedback loops in which just the right amount of correction is applied with optimum timing, can be very stable, accurate, and responsive.

Negative feedback is widely used in mechanical and electronic engineering, and also within living organisms, and can be seen in many other fields from chemistry and economics to physical systems such as the climate. General negative feedback systems are studied in control systems engineering.

Negative feedback loops also play an integral role in maintaining the atmospheric balance in various systems on Earth. One such feedback system is the interaction between solar radiation, cloud cover, and planet temperature.

== General description ==
In many physical and biological systems, qualitatively different influences can oppose each other. For example, in biochemistry, one set of chemicals drives the system in a given direction, whereas another set of chemicals drives it in an opposing direction. If one or both of these opposing influences are non-linear, equilibrium point(s) result.

In biology, this process (in general, biochemical) is often referred to as homeostasis; whereas in mechanics, the more common term is equilibrium.

In engineering, mathematics and the physical, and biological sciences, common terms for the points around which the system gravitates include: attractors, stable states, eigenstates/eigenfunctions, equilibrium points, and setpoints.

In control theory, &quot;negative&quot; refers to the sign of the multiplier in mathematical models for feedback. In delta notation, −Δoutput is added to or mixed into the input. In multivariate systems, vectors help to illustrate how several influences can both partially complement and partially oppose each other.

Some authors, in particular with respect to modelling business systems, use &quot;negative&quot; to refer to the reduction in difference between the desired and actual behavior of a system. In a psychology context, on the other hand, &quot;negative&quot; refers to the valence of the feedback – attractive versus aversive, or praise versus criticism.

In contrast, positive feedback is feedback in which the system responds so as to increase the magnitude of any particular perturbation, resulting in amplification of the original signal instead of stabilization. Any system in which there is positive feedback together with a gain greater than one will result in a runaway situation. Both positive and negative feedback require a feedback loop to operate.

However, negative feedback systems can still be subject to oscillations. This is caused by a phase shift around any loop. Due to these phase shifts the feedback signal of some frequencies can ultimately become in phase with the input signal and thus turn into positive feedback, creating a runaway condition. Even before the point where the phase shift becomes 180 degrees, stability of the negative feedback loop will become compromised, leading to increasing under- and overshoot following a disturbance. This problem is often dealt with by attenuating or changing the phase of the problematic frequencies in a design step called compensation. Unless the system naturally has sufficient damping, many negative feedback systems have low pass filters or dampers fitted.

== Examples ==
* Mercury thermostats (circa 1600) using expansion and contraction of columns of mercury in response to temperature changes were used in negative feedback systems to control vents in furnaces, maintaining a steady internal temperature.
* In the invisible hand of the market metaphor of economic theory (1776), reactions to price movements provide a feedback mechanism to match supply and demand.
* In centrifugal governors (1788), negative feedback is used to maintain a near-constant speed of an engine, irrespective of the load or fuel-supply conditions.
* In a steering engine (1866), power assistance is applied to the rudder with a feedback loop, to maintain the direction set by the steersman.
* In servomechanisms, the speed or position of an output, as determined by a sensor, is compared to a set value, and any error is reduced by negative feedback to the input.
* In audio amplifiers, negative feedback flattens frequency response, reduces distortion, minimises the effect of manufacturing variations in component parameters, and compensates for changes in characteristics due to temperature change.
* In analog computing, feedback around operational amplifiers is used to generate mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, integration, differentiation, logarithm, and antilog functions.
* In delta-sigma analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (particularly for high quality audio), a negative feedback loop is used to repeatedly correct accumulated quantization error during conversion.
* In a phase locked loop (1932), feedback is used to maintain a generated alternating waveform in a constant phase to a reference signal. In many implementations the generated waveform is the output, but when used as a demodulator in an FM radio receiver, the error feedback voltage serves as the demodulated output signal. If there is a frequency divider between the generated waveform and the phase comparator, the device acts as a frequency multiplier.
* In organisms, feedback enables various measures (e.g. body temperature, or blood sugar level) to be maintained within a desired range by homeostatic processes.

One use of feedback is to make a system (say &quot;T&quot;) self-regulating to minimize the effect of a disturbance (say &quot;D&quot;). Using a negative feedback loop, a measurement of some variable (for example, a process variable, say &quot;E&quot;) is subtracted from a required value (the &#x27;set point&#x27;) to estimate an operational error in system status, which is then used by a regulator (say &quot;R&quot;) to reduce the gap between the measurement and the required value. The regulator modifies the input to the system &quot;T&quot; according to its interpretation of the error in the status of the system. This error may be introduced by a variety of possible disturbances or &#x27;upsets&#x27;, some slow and some rapid. The regulation in such systems can range from a simple &#x27;on-off&#x27; control to a more complex processing of the error signal.

In this framework, the physical form of a signal may undergo multiple transformations. For example, a change in weather may cause a disturbance to the &quot;heat&quot; input to a house (as an example of the system &quot;T&quot;) that is monitored by a thermometer as a change in &quot;temperature&quot; (as an example of an &#x27;essential variable&#x27; &quot;E&quot;). This quantity, then, is converted by the thermostat (a &#x27;comparator&#x27;) into an &quot;electrical&quot; error in status compared to the &#x27;set point&#x27; &quot;S&quot;, and subsequently used by the regulator (containing a &#x27;controller&#x27; that commands &quot;gas&quot; control valves and an ignitor) ultimately to change the &quot;heat&quot; provided by a furnace (an &#x27;effector&#x27;) to counter the initial weather-related disturbance in heat input to the house.

Error controlled regulation is typically carried out using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller (PID controller). The regulator signal is derived from a weighted sum of the error signal, integral of the error signal, and derivative of the error signal. The weights of the respective components depend on the application.

Mathematically, the regulator signal is given by:
:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the &quot;integral time&quot;
:formula_3 is the &quot;derivative time&quot;

===Negative feedback amplifier===

The negative feedback amplifier was invented by Harold Stephen Black at Bell Laboratories in 1927, and granted a patent in 1937 (US Patent 2,102,671) &quot;a continuation of application Serial No. 298,155, filed August 8, 1928 ...&quot;).
:&quot;The patent is 52 pages long plus 35 pages of figures. The first 43 pages amount to a small treatise on feedback amplifiers!&quot;

There are many advantages to feedback in amplifiers. In design, the type of feedback and amount of feedback are carefully selected to weigh and optimize these various benefits.

Advantages of negative voltage feedback in amplifiers
# It reduces non-linear distortion, that is, it has higher fidelity.
# It increases circuit stability: that is, the gain remains stable though there are variations in ambient temperature, frequency and signal amplitude.
# It increases bandwidth slightly.
# It modifies the input and output impedances.
# Harmonic, phase, amplitude, and frequency distortions are all reduced considerably.
# Noise is reduced considerably.

Though negative feedback has many advantages, amplifiers with feedback can oscillate. See the article on step response. They may even exhibit instability. Harry Nyquist of Bell Laboratories proposed the Nyquist stability criterion and the Nyquist plot that identify stable feedback systems, including amplifiers and control systems.
The figure shows a simplified block diagram of a negative feedback amplifier.

The feedback sets the overall (closed-loop) amplifier gain at a value:

:formula_4

where the approximate value assumes β&quot;A &quot; » 1. This expression shows that a gain greater than one requires β &lt; 1. Because the approximate gain 1/β is independent of the open-loop gain &quot;A&quot;, the feedback is said to &#x27;desensitize&#x27; the closed-loop gain to variations in &quot;A &quot; (for example, due to manufacturing variations between units, or temperature effects upon components), provided only that the gain &quot;A&quot; is sufficiently large. In this context, the factor (1+β&quot;A&quot;) is often called the &#x27;desensitivity factor&#x27;, and in the broader context of feedback effects that include other matters like electrical impedance and bandwidth, the &#x27;improvement factor&#x27;.

If the disturbance &quot;D&quot; is included, the amplifier output becomes:
:formula_5

which shows that the feedback reduces the effect of the disturbance by the &#x27;improvement factor&#x27; (1+β &quot;A&quot;). The disturbance &quot;D&quot; might arise from fluctuations in the amplifier output due to noise and nonlinearity (distortion) within this amplifier, or from other noise sources such as power supplies.

The difference signal &quot;I&quot;–β&quot;O&quot; at the amplifier input is sometimes called the &quot;error signal&quot;. According to the diagram, the error signal is:
:formula_6

From this expression, it can be seen that a large &#x27;improvement factor&#x27; (or a large loop gain β&quot;A&quot;) tends to keep this error signal small.

Although the diagram illustrates the principles of the negative feedback amplifier, modeling a real amplifier as a unilateral forward amplification block and a unilateral feedback block has significant limitations. For methods of analysis that do not make these idealizations, see the article Negative feedback amplifier.

===Operational amplifier circuits===


The operational amplifier was originally developed as a building block for the construction of analog computers, but is now used almost universally in all kinds of applications including audio equipment and control systems.

Operational amplifier circuits typically employ negative feedback to get a predictable transfer function. Since the open-loop gain of an op-amp is extremely large, a small differential input signal would drive the output of the amplifier to one rail or the other in the absence of negative feedback. A simple example of the use of feedback is the op-amp voltage amplifier shown in the figure.

The idealized model of an operational amplifier assumes that the gain is infinite, the input impedance is infinite, output resistance is zero, and input offset currents and voltages are zero. Such an ideal amplifier draws no current from the resistor divider. 
Ignoring dynamics (transient effects and propagation delay), the infinite gain of the ideal op-amp means this feedback circuit drives the voltage difference between the two op-amp inputs to zero. Consequently, the voltage gain of the circuit in the diagram, assuming an ideal op amp, is the reciprocal of feedback voltage division ratio β:

:formula_7.

A real op-amp has a high but finite gain &quot;A&quot; at low frequencies, decreasing gradually at higher frequencies. In addition, it exhibits a finite input impedance and a non-zero output impedance. Although practical op-amps are not ideal, the model of an ideal op-amp often suffices to understand circuit operation at low enough frequencies. 
As discussed in the previous section, the feedback circuit stabilizes the closed-loop gain and desensitizes the output to fluctuations generated inside the amplifier itself.

== Areas of application ==

=== Mechanical engineering ===
An example of the use of negative feedback control is the ballcock control of water level (see diagram), or a pressure regulator. In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in engine governors, fuel injection systems and carburettors. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving air conditioners, refrigerators, or freezers.

=== Biology ===

Some biological systems exhibit negative feedback such as the baroreflex in blood pressure regulation and erythropoiesis. Many biological processes (e.g., in the human anatomy) use negative feedback. Examples of this are numerous, from the regulating of body temperature, to the regulating of blood glucose levels. The disruption of feedback loops can lead to undesirable results: in the case of blood glucose levels, if negative feedback fails, the glucose levels in the blood may begin to rise dramatically, thus resulting in diabetes.

For hormone secretion regulated by the negative feedback loop: when gland X releases hormone X, this stimulates target cells to release hormone Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y, gland X &quot;senses&quot; this and inhibits its release of hormone X. As shown in the figure, most endocrine hormones are controlled by a physiologic negative feedback inhibition loop, such as the glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal cortex. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which directs the anterior pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. Glucocorticoids not only perform their respective functions throughout the body but also negatively affect the release of further stimulating secretions of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, effectively reducing the output of glucocorticoids once a sufficient amount has been released.

=== Chemistry ===

Closed systems containing substances undergoing a reversible chemical reaction can also exhibit negative feedback in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle which shift the chemical equilibrium to the opposite side of the reaction in order to reduce a stress. For example, in the reaction 
: N2 + 3 H2 ⇌ 2 NH3 + 92 kJ/mol
If a mixture of the reactants and products exists at equilibrium in a sealed container and nitrogen gas is added to this system, then the equilibrium will shift toward the product side in response. If the temperature is raised, then the equilibrium will shift toward the reactant side which, since the reverse reaction is endothermic, will partially reduce the temperature.

===Self-organization===

Self-organization is the capability of certain systems &quot;of organizing their own behavior or structure&quot;. There are many possible factors contributing to this capacity, and most often positive feedback is identified as a possible contributor. However, negative feedback also can play a role.

=== Economics ===

In economics, automatic stabilisers are government programs that are intended to work as negative feedback to dampen fluctuations in real GDP.

Mainstream economics asserts that the market pricing mechanism operates to match supply and demand, because mismatches between them feed back into the decision-making of suppliers and demanders of goods, altering prices and thereby reducing any discrepancy. However Norbert Wiener wrote in 1948:

:&quot;There is a belief current in many countries and elevated to the rank of an official article of faith in the United States that free competition is itself a homeostatic process... Unfortunately the evidence, such as it is, is against this simple-minded theory.&quot;

The notion of economic equilibrium being maintained in this fashion by market forces has also been questioned by numerous heterodox economists such as financier George Soros and leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, who was with the World Bank in 1988–1994.

=== Environmental Science ===

A basic and common example of a negative feedback system in the environment is the interaction among cloud cover, plant growth, solar radiation, and planet temperature. As incoming solar radiation increases, planet temperature increases. As the temperature increases, the amount of plant life that can grow increases. This plant life can then make products such as sulfur which produce more cloud cover. An increase in cloud cover leads to higher albedo, or surface reflectivity, of the Earth. As albedo increases, however, the amount of solar radiation decreases. This, in turn, affects the rest of the cycle.

Cloud cover, and in turn planet albedo and temperature, is also influenced by the hydrological cycle. As planet temperature increases, more water vapor is produced, creating more clouds. The clouds then block incoming solar radiation, lowering the temperature of the planet. This interaction produces less water vapor and therefore less cloud cover. The cycle then repeats in a negative feedback loop. In this way, negative feedback loops in the environment have a stabilizing effect.

== History ==
Negative feedback as a control technique may be seen in the refinements of the water clock introduced by Ktesibios of Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and were used to maintain a constant level in the reservoirs of water clocks as early as 200 BCE.
Negative feedback was implemented in the 17th century. Cornelius Drebbel had built thermostatically controlled incubators and ovens in the early 1600s, and centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills. James Watt patented a form of governor in 1788 to control the speed of his steam engine, and James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 described &quot;component motions&quot; associated with these governors that lead to a decrease in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation.

The term &quot;feedback&quot; was well established by the 1920s, in reference to a means of boosting the gain of an electronic amplifier. Friis and Jensen described this action as &quot;positive feedback&quot; and made passing mention of a contrasting &quot;negative feed-back action&quot; in 1924. Harold Stephen Black came up with the idea of using negative feedback in electronic amplifiers in 1927, submitted a patent application in 1928, and detailed its use in his paper of 1934, where he defined negative feedback as a type of coupling that &quot;reduced&quot; the gain of the amplifier, in the process greatly increasing its stability and bandwidth.

Karl Küpfmüller published papers on a negative-feedback-based automatic gain control system and a feedback system stability criterion in 1928.

Nyquist and Bode built on Black&#x27;s work to develop a theory of amplifier stability.

Early researchers in the area of cybernetics subsequently generalized the idea of negative feedback to cover any goal-seeking or purposeful behavior.

Cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener helped to formalize the concepts of feedback control, defining feedback in general as &quot;the chain of the transmission and return of information&quot;, and negative feedback as the case when:

While the view of feedback as any &quot;circularity of action&quot; helped to keep the theory simple and consistent, Ashby pointed out that, while it may clash with definitions that require a &quot;materially evident&quot; connection, &quot;the exact definition of feedback is nowhere important&quot;. Ashby pointed out the limitations of the concept of &quot;feedback&quot;:
To reduce confusion, later authors have suggested alternative terms such as &quot;degenerative&quot;, &quot;self-correcting&quot;, &quot;balancing&quot;, or &quot;discrepancy-reducing&quot; in place of &quot;negative&quot;.

<text>Giant tortoises are any of several species of various large land tortoises, which include a number of extinct species, as well as two extant species with multiple subspecies formerly common on the islands of the western Indian Ocean and on the Galápagos Islands.

==History==
As of February 2024, two different species of giant tortoise are found on two remote groups of tropical islands: Aldabra Atoll and Fregate Island in the Seychelles and the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador. These tortoises can weigh as much as and can grow to be long. Giant tortoises originally made their way to islands from the mainland via oceanic dispersal. Tortoises are aided in such dispersal by their ability to float with their heads up and to survive for up to six months without food or fresh water. 

Giant tortoises were once all placed in a single genus (often referred to as &quot;Testudo&quot; or &quot;Geochelone&quot;), but more recent studies have shown that giant tortoises represent several distinct lineages that are not closely related to one another. These lineages appear to have developed large size independently and, as a result, giant tortoises are polyphyletic. For example, the Aldabra Atoll (&quot;Aldabrachelys&quot;) giant tortoises are related to Malagasy tortoises (&quot;Asterochelys&quot;) while the Galapagos giant tortoises are related to South American mainland tortoises, particularly the Chaco tortoise (&quot;Chelonoidis chiliensis&quot;). The recently extinct Mascarene giant tortoises (&quot;Cylindraspis&quot;) are thought to have belonged to their own branch of the tortoise family, being sister to all other modern tortoise genera aside from &quot;Manouria&quot;, &quot;Gopherus&quot;, and &quot;Testudo&quot;. 

Giant tortoises are classified into several distinct genera, including &quot;Aldabrachelys&quot;, &quot;Centrochelys&quot; (in part, often excluding the extant African spurred tortoise (&quot;Centrochelys sulcata&quot;)), &quot;Chelonoidis&quot; (in part), †&quot;Cylindraspis&quot; (extinct c. 1840)&quot;,&quot; †&quot;Hesperotestudo&quot; (extinct c. 9,000 years Before Present)&quot;,&quot; †&quot;Megalochelys&quot;, †&quot;Solitudo&quot;, and †&quot;Titanochelon.&quot; Both &quot;Megalochelys&quot; and &quot;Titanochelon&quot; reached sizes substantially greater than modern giant tortoises, with up to and shell lengths respectively.

The phenomenon of animal species evolving in cache to unusually large size on islands (in comparison to continental relatives) is known as island gigantism or insular gigantism. This may occur due to factors such as relaxed predation pressure, competitive release, or as an adaptation to increased environmental fluctuations on islands. However, giant tortoises are no longer considered to be classic examples of island gigantism, as similarly massive tortoises are now known to have once been widespread. Giant tortoises were formerly common (prior to the Quaternary extinctions) across the Cenozoic faunas of Eurasia, Africa and the Americas.

Giant tortoises are notably absent from Australia and the South Pacific. However, extinct giant horned turtles (Meiolaniidae) likely filled a similar niche, with Late Pleistocene-Holocene meiolaniid species being known from Australia, New Caledonia, Lord Howe Island, Vanuatu, and the Fijian Archipelago. The identity of the Vanuatu meiolaniid has been controversial, however, with some studies concluding the remains actually belong to a giant tortoise, which are otherwise unknown from this region. Older (Early Miocene) meiolaniids are also known from the St. Bathans fauna in New Zealand.

Although often considered examples of island gigantism, prior to the arrival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; giant tortoises also occurred in non-island locales, as well as on a number of other, more accessible islands. During the Pleistocene, and mostly during the last 50,000 years, tortoises of the mainland of southern Asia (†&quot;Megalochelys atlas&quot;), North America (†&quot;Hesperotestudo&quot; spp.) and South America (&quot;Chelonoidis&quot; spp.), Indonesia, Madagascar (†&quot;Aldabrachelys&quot;) and even the island of Malta all became extinct. 

Giant tortoises (†&quot;Titanochelon&quot;) also inhabited mainland Europe until the Early Pleistocene (2.0 Mya). The giant tortoises formerly of Africa died out somewhat earlier, during the Late Pliocene. While the timing of the disappearances of various extinct giant tortoise species seems to correlate with the arrival of humans, direct evidence for human involvement in these extinctions is usually lacking; however, such evidence has been obtained in the case of the distantly-related giant meiolaniid turtle &quot;Meiolania damelipi&quot; in Vanuatu. One interesting relic is the shell of an extinct giant tortoise found in a submerged sinkhole in Florida with a wooden spear piercing through it, carbon dated to 12,000 years ago. 

Today, only one of the subspecies of the Indian Ocean survives in the wild; the Aldabra giant tortoise (two more are claimed to exist in captive or re-released populations, but some genetic studies have cast doubt on the validity of these as separate species) and 10 extant species in the Galápagos.

==Life expectancy==
Giant tortoises are among the world&#x27;s longest-living animals, with an average lifespan of 100 years or more. The Madagascar radiated tortoise Tu&#x27;i Malila was 188 at her death in Tonga in 1965. Harriet (initially thought to be one of the three Galápagos tortoises brought back to England from Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage, but later shown to be from an island not even visited by Darwin) was reported by the Australia Zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. 

On 23 March 2006, an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita died at the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. He was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of Lord Clive and is thought to have been around 255 years old when he died. Around the time of its discovery, they were caught for food in such large numbers that they became virtually extinct by 1900. Giant tortoises are now protected by strict conservation laws and are categorized as threatened species.

==List of insular species==
Taxonomy of extant and extinct insular giant tortoise species follows Rhodin &quot;et al&quot;. (2021), unless otherwise noted.

===&quot;Aldabrachelys&quot;===
===&quot;Chelonoidis&quot;===
===Other genera===
==Aldabra giant tortoise==
The Aldabra giant tortoise (&quot;Aldabrachelys gigantea)&quot; lives on the remote Aldabra Atoll, one of the Seychelles group of islands in the Indian Ocean It is the only living species in the genus &quot;Aldabrachelys.&quot; Two other species in the genus, &quot;Aldabrachelys abrupta,&quot; and &quot;Aldabrachelys grandidieri&quot; were formerly endemic to Madagascar, but became extinct after the arrival of people.

===Distribution and habitat===

Aldabra giant tortoises have large dome-shaped shells in order to protect their delicate bodies that lie beneath their shells. They also have long necks in order to eat leaves from the higher branches of trees. The males, although not much bigger than the females, weigh nearly 100 kg (220 lbs) more. They move slowly and have small, thick legs and round, almost flat feet that assist them in walking on sand.

The Aldabra giant tortoise mainly inhabits grasslands and swamps on Aldabra Atoll&#x27;s islands, which form a part of the Seychelles island chain in the Indian Ocean. In the past, they shared the islands with multiple other giant tortoise species, but many of them were hunted to extinction in the 1700s and 1800s. Despite the fact that they are usually found in regions of dense low-lying vegetation, they have been known to wander into areas with more sparse vegetation and rocks when food is scarce. They can also be seen resting in shaded areas or shallow pools of water in order to cool themselves on hot days. Aldabra giant tortoises tend to spend their lives grazing, but will cover surprising distances in search of food and have also been observed on bare rock and thin soil. They can drink from very shallow pools through their nostrils; the former genus &quot;Dipsochelys&quot; refers to this adaptation.

===Species and subspecies===
==Galápagos giant tortoise==
The closest living relative of the Galápagos giant tortoise (&quot;Chelonoidis niger&quot;) is the small Chaco tortoise from South America, although it is not a direct ancestor. Scientists believe the first tortoises arrived to the Galápagos 2–3 million years ago by drifting 600 miles from the South American coast on vegetation rafts or on their own. They were already large animals before arriving in the Galápagos. Colonizing the easternmost islands of Española and San Cristóbal first, they then dispersed throughout the archipelago, eventually establishing about 16 separate populations on 10 of the largest of the Galápagos Islands. Currently, there are only 10 subspecies of Galápagos giant tortoises left of the original 16 subspecies. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Galápagos were frequented by buccaneers preying on Spanish treasure ships. Filling a ship&#x27;s hold with tortoises was an easy way to stock up on food, a tradition that was continued by whalers in the centuries that followed. The tortoises also conveniently held water in their necks that could be used as drinking water.

These buccaneers stocked giant tortoises not only because of their meat but because of these animals&#x27; ability to survive for six months to one year without food or water. Once buccaneers, whalers and fur sealers discovered that they could have fresh meat for their long s by storing live giant tortoises in the holds of their ships, massive exploitation of the species began. Tortoises were also exploited for their oil, which was used to light the lamps of Quito. 

Two centuries of exploitation resulted in the loss of between 100,000 and 200,000 tortoises. Three subspecies have been extinct since the 19th century, and a fourth subspecies lost its last member, Lonesome George, in June 2012. In February 2019, a tortoise subspecies once thought to have been extinct since 1906, the Fernandina giant tortoise, was discovered on its namesake island in the Galápagos. It is estimated that 20,000–25,000 wild tortoises live on the islands today.

===Distribution and habitat===
Galápagos tortoises are mainly herbivorous, feeding primarily on cactus pads, grasses, and native fruit but have been recorded eating baby birds in the case of the aldabran species. They drink large quantities of water when available that they can store in their bladders for long periods of time. There are two main types of shell among them, the saddle-backed shell and the domed shell. They both provide special adaption to different environments. The saddle-backed tortoises are the smallest Galápagos tortoises, but present a very long neck and pairs of legs. They live on arid zone and feed on cactus. The domed tortoises are bigger with shorter neck and legs, they are found in the more vegetated islands and feed on grass.

They spend an average of 16 hours a day resting. Their activity level is driven by ambient temperature and food availability. In the cool season, they are active at midday, sleeping in during the morning and afternoon. In the hot season, their active period is early morning and late afternoon, while midday finds them resting and trying to keep cool under the shade of a bush or half-submerged in muddy wallows.

===Life cycle===
Tortoises breed primarily during the hot season from January to May; however, tortoises can be seen mating any month of the year. During the cool season (June to November), female tortoises migrate to nesting zones, which are generally located in low lands of the islands, to lay their eggs. A female can lay from 1–4 nests over a nesting season from June to December. She digs the hole with her hind feet, then lets the eggs drop down into the nest, and finally covers it again with her hind feet. The number of eggs ranges from 2 to 7 for saddle-backed tortoises to sometimes more than 20 to 25 eggs for domed tortoises. 

The eggs incubate from 110 to 175 days (incubation periods depend on the month the clutch was produced, with eggs laid early in the cool season requiring longer incubation periods than eggs laid at the end of the cool season, when the majority of their incubation will occur at the start of the hot season). After hatching, the young hatchlings remain in the nest for a few weeks before emerging out a small hole adjacent to the nest cap. Usually, the temperature of the nest influences on the sex of the hatchling. Warm temperatures would yield more females, while colder temperatures would yield more males.

===Subspecies===
==Mascarenes giant tortoises==

The Mascarene Islands of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues once harboured five species of giant tortoise belonging to the extinct genus &quot;Cylindraspis&quot;, comprising two species occurring on Mauritius, another two on Rodrigues, and one on Réunion. The tortoises were unique to these islands and had gained a number of special adaptations in the absence of ground predators. They differed from any other giant tortoise species because of their modified jaws, reduced scales on the legs and shells averaging just 1mm thick. The shells of the giant tortoises were open-ended; the name &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; actually means &quot;cylinder-shaped&quot;. This was a specific adaptation in response to the lack of predators, where thick, heavily armored shells were no longer necessary. 

They belonged to a far more ancient lineage than the two extant giant tortoises, having diverged from all other tortoises during the Eocene, with divergence between the individual species far greater than that between the insular subspecies of the extant tortoises. The divergences between some &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; species are thought to be even older than the geologic history of the modern Mascarenes themselves, indicating that &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; originally inhabited several now-submerged island chains of the Mascarene Plateau before colonizing the modern Mascarene islands following their formation.

Around the 16th century, with human arrival and the subsequent introduction of domestic animals, particularly pigs, the tortoises were hunted to extinction. The thin shells were of no protection against these new invaders; rats, cats and pigs devoured the eggs and young and thousands were collected alive for provisioning ships. Sometimes they were even hunted for their oil, which was very valuable around that time because it provided a cure for many ailments, including scurvy.

On Mauritius, the giant tortoise disappeared from the main island by the end of the 17th century and the very last tortoises survived until the 1730s on the islets in the north. Around the late 1800s, large number of tortoise bones were discovered in the Mare aux Songes excavations. These resulted in the description of the two species of giant tortoise endemic to Mauritius, the Mauritius saddle-backed (&quot;Cylindraspis inepta&quot;) and the Mauritius domed (&quot;Cylindraspis triserrata&quot;).

Today, the only remains from these five species are a number of fossil bones and shells, a few drawings of live animals and one stuffed Rodrigues saddle-backed giant tortoise in France&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History.

<doc id="213330" wikidata="Q1053575" url="?curid=213330" title="Scarborough Fair (ballad)">
<text>&quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; () is a traditional English ballad. The song lists a number of impossible tasks given to a former lover who lives in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The &quot;Scarborough/Whittingham Fair&quot; variant was most common in Yorkshire and Northumbria, where it was sung to various melodies, often using Dorian mode, with refrains resembling &quot;parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme&quot; and &quot;Then she&#x27;ll be a true love of mine.&quot; It appears in &quot;Traditional Tunes&quot; (1891) by Frank Kidson, who claims to have collected it from Whitby.

The famous melody was collected from Mark Anderson (1874–1953), a retired lead miner from Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham, England, by Ewan MacColl in 1947. This version was recorded by a number of musicians in the 20th century, including the iconic 1968 arrangement in counterpoint by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, who learned the ballad from Martin Carthy. A slightly different rendition of the ballad (referred to as &quot;The Cambric Shirt&quot;, or &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;) had been recorded by John Lomax in 1939 in the United States.

==History==
The lyrics of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; appear to have something in common with a Scottish ballad titled &quot;The Elfin Knight&quot;, collected by Francis James Child as Child Ballad #2, which has been traced as far back as 1670. In this ballad, an elf threatens to abduct a young woman to be his lover unless she can perform an impossible task (&quot;For thou must shape a to me / Without any cut or heme, quoth he&quot;); she responds with a list of tasks that he must first perform (&quot;I have an aiker of good ley-land / Which lyeth low by yon sea-strand&quot;).

Dozens of versions existed by the end of the 18th century. A number of older versions refer to locations other than Scarborough Fair, including Wittingham Fair, Cape Ann, &quot;twixt Berwik and Lyne&quot;, etc. Many versions do not mention a place name and are often generically titled (&quot;The Lovers&#x27; Tasks&quot;, &quot;My Father Gave Me an Acre of Land&quot;, etc.).

The references to the traditional English gathering &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, and the refrain &quot;parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme&quot;, date to 19th-century versions, and may have been borrowed from the ballad &quot;Riddles Wisely Expounded&quot; (Child Ballad #1), which has a similar plot.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics, as published by Frank Kidson in 1891, begin:

===Alternative refrains===
The oldest versions of &quot;The Elfin Knight&quot; (circa 1650) contain the refrain &quot;my plaid away, my plaid away, the wind shall not blow my plaid away.&quot; Slightly more recent versions often contain one of a group of related refrains:
*&quot;Sober and grave grows merry in time&quot;
*&quot;Every rose grows merry with time&quot;
*&quot;There&#x27;s never a rose grows fairer with time&quot;
*&quot;Whilst every grove rings with a merry antine&quot;

These are usually paired with &quot;Once (s)he was a true love of mine&quot; or some variant. &quot;Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme&quot; may simply be an alternate rhyming refrain to the original based on a corruption of &quot;grows merry in time&quot; into &quot;rosemary and thyme.&quot;

==Recordings==

===Field recordings===
Early audio field recordings of the ballad include the following examples:
* Georgia Ann Griffin of Newberry, Alachua, Florida. Recorded by John Lomax in 1939.
* Allie Long Parker of Hogscald Hollow, Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Recorded by Mary Parler on 7 April 1958.
* Sara Cleveland of Brant Lake, New York. Recorded by Sandy Paton in 1966.
* Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Jefferies. Recorded in Bristol by Barry and Chris Morgan in 1976.

===Commercial recordings===

====1950s====
The earliest commercial recording of the ballad was made by actors and singers Gordon Heath and Lee Payant, Americans who ran a café and nightclub, L&#x27;Abbaye, on the Rive Gauche in Paris. The recording appeared on the 1955 Elektra album &quot;Encores from the Abbaye&quot;. The song was also included on the 1956 album &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads vol IV&quot; by A. L. Lloyd and Ewan MacColl, using Kidson&#x27;s melody.

The first recorded version using the best-known melody was performed by Audrey Coppard on the 1956 album &quot;English Folk Songs&quot;. A decade after collecting the song, MacColl released his own version, accompanied by Peggy Seeger on guitar, on the 1957 LP &quot;Matching Songs of the British Isles and America&quot; and an a capella rendition another decade later on &quot;The Long Harvest&quot; (1967).

====1960s====
The version using the melody later used by Simon &amp; Garfunkel in &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; was sung to Ewan MacColl in 1947 by Mark Anderson (1874–1953), a retired lead miner from Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham, England. No audio recording of Anderson&#x27;s version was ever made, although Alan Lomax recorded Anderson singing other songs in 1951. MacColl printed the lyrics and melody in a book of Teesdale folk songs, and later included it on his and Peggy Seeger&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Island&quot; in 1960.

In 1965, Martin Carthy sang &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; on his eponymous debut album after having picked up the tune from the songbook by MacColl and Seeger.

Marianne Faithfull recorded the song for her second American studio album &quot;Go Away From My World&quot;, released in December 1965.

&quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; appeared as the lead track on the 1966 Simon &amp; Garfunkel album &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; in counterpoint with &quot;Canticle&quot;, a reworking of the lyrics from Simon&#x27;s 1963 anti-war song &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot;. The duo learned their arrangement of the song from Martin Carthy, but did not credit him as the arranger. They later made a &quot;pretty substantial&quot; monetary settlement with Carthy&#x27;s publisher when asked, but unbeknownst to them, Carthy himself did not receive anything from it.

Sergio Mendes and Brasil 66 scored a U.S. #16 hit (#2 AC) with their light jazz/samba/pop version in 1968, which was used in the 1973 animated film &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;.

In 1969, Vicky Leandros recorded the song in several versions for release throughout Europe, Canada and Japan, singing in English, German, French (&quot;Chèvrefeuille que tu es loin&quot;) and Greek (&quot;Νά Θυμάσαι Πώς Μ&#x27; αγαπάς&quot;).

====1980s====

American folk punk band Cordelia&#x27;s Dad recorded a version for their 1989 self-titled debut album.

The Stone Roses set their own words to the melody for &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;, a track on their eponymous debut album (1989).

====2000s====

It was recorded by Seattle-based progressive rock band Queensrÿche. At first released on a stand alone CD, it was later included on the 2003 remastered version of their album &quot;Empire&quot;.

Celtic Woman recorded a version of the song for their third album &quot;A New Journey&quot;, released in January 2007.

The English death-doom metal band My Dying Bride recorded a version with two additional stanzas by its lead singer Aaron Stainthorpe, which appears on its 2009 EP &quot;Bring Me Victory&quot;.

German/Norwegian symphonic metal band Leaves&#x27; Eyes recorded a version of this song on their 2009 album &quot;Njord&quot;.)

====2010s====

Nox Arcana recorded a ghost-story version with all original lyrics by Joseph Vargo for the 2012 album Winter&#x27;s Majesty.

====2020s====

In 2020, Dan Avidan collaborated with musical group Super Guitar Bros to record the Simon &amp; Garfunkel version of the song, including the &quot;Canticle&quot; counterpoint, for the album &quot;Dan Avidan &amp; Super Guitar Bros&quot; that was released in April of that year.

===Simon &amp; Garfunkel version===
In London in 1965, Paul Simon learned the song from Martin Carthy, who had picked up the song from the songbook by MacColl and Seeger and included it on his eponymous 1965 album. Simon &amp; Garfunkel set it in counterpoint with &quot;Canticle&quot;, a reworking of the lyrics from Simon&#x27;s 1963 anti-war song &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot;; they used the same tune as Carthy had for the traditional lyrics, while Simon&#x27;s anti-war lyrics were set to a new melody composed mainly by Art Garfunkel. &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; appeared as the lead track on the 1966 album &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;, and was released as a single after it had been featured on the soundtrack to &quot;The Graduate&quot; in 1968. The copyright credited only Simon and Garfunkel as the authors, which upset Carthy, who felt that the &quot;traditional&quot; source should have been credited. The rift persisted until Simon invited Carthy to perform the song with him as a duet in a concert at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo in October 2000. Simon performed the song with the Muppets when he guest-starred on season 5, episode 11 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (October 18, 1980).

Before Simon learned the song, Bob Dylan had borrowed the melody and several lines of lyrics from Carthy&#x27;s arrangement to create his song &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot;, which is featured on &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; (1963), &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; (1969) (with Johnny Cash), &quot;Real Live&quot; (1984) and &quot;The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration&quot; (1993).

=== Soundtrack recordings ===

The Simon and Garfunkel version of the song was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;The Graduate&quot; in 1968.

Instrumental versions of Scarborough Fair were arranged by Geoff Knorr for use in the video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot; as the main theme of the English civilization. As the themes of each civilization are played as different variations of the same song as the game progresses, four different variations of the song are included in the game&#x27;s soundtrack, with Phill Boucher assisting Knorr in the arrangement of the Atomic Era version of the song.

<text>Pemba Island (; &quot;al-Jazīra al-khadrāʔ&quot;; ; ) is a Tanzanian island forming part of the Zanzibar Archipelago, lying within the Swahili Coast in the Indian Ocean.

==Geography==

With a land area of it is situated about north of Unguja, the largest island of the archipelago. 

Surrounded by relatively deep water, the island of Pemba is thought to have been a part of the mainland, which split off along the Pemba rift approximately 10 million years ago.
In 1964, Zanzibar was united with the former colony of Tanganyika to form Tanzania. It lies east of mainland Tanzania, across the Pemba Channel. Together with Mafia Island (south of Unguja), these islands form the Spice Islands (not to be confused with the Maluku Islands of Indonesia).

Most of the island, which is hillier and more fertile than Unguja, is dominated by small scale farming. There is also large scale farming of cash crops such as cloves.

In previous years, the island was seldom visited due to inaccessibility and a reputation for political violence, with the notable exception of those drawn by its reputation as a center for traditional medicine and witchcraft. There is a quite large Arab community on the island, who immigrated from Oman. The population is a mix of Arab and original Waswahili inhabitants of the island. A significant portion of the population also identifies as Shirazi people. The overwhelming majority of the island&#x27;s population follows Islam and identify as Muslim.

The most important towns in Pemba are Chake-Chake (the capital), Mkoani, and Wete, which is the largest city. The centrally located Chake-Chake is perched on a mound with a view to the west on a bay and the tiny Misali Island, where the tides determine when a dhow can enter the local harbour. Pemba is, with the exception of a strip of land along its eastern coast, a very fertile place: besides clove trees, the locals grow mainly rice, coconut, bananas, cassava, and red beans (called &quot;maharagwe&quot; in the Swahili language).

Pemba is home to several dive sites, with steep drop-offs, untouched coral, and very abundant marine life.

===Islets===
*Fundo - is located few miles from Wete. It is the only inhabited island among the group of islets forming the north-west reef of Pemba. The other islets there include Njao, Kashani, Kokota, Funzi, and Uvinje. 
**Njao - is the northernmost islet on the Fundo group. It is mainly used for agricultural purposes. 
**Kashani - is on the same reef as Fundo but on the southernmost tip close to Ras Mkumbuu.
**Kokota - is located at the southern mouth of Wete port. 
**Funzi - lies east of Kokota and south of Uvinje island.
**Uvinje - is used for farming and located at the southern mouth of Wete port.
*Kiweni (Shamiani) - located on the south west part of Pemba, it is an uninhabited islet used mainly for farming and livestock grazing. On its southernmost tip it has a very fine beach and some prospective investors were building a hotel in the late 1990s.
*Kojani - is the only inhabited island on the western side of Pemba island. It is home to some skilled artisanal fishermen in East Africa who seasonally travel to most parts of the coast in search of schools of fish to catch.
*Kwata - the island was the site of the first major outbreak of cholera in 1978 when travelers were temporarily quarantined at this island before being allowed into Pemba. 
*Makoongwe - is few kilometers from Mkoani. It has characteristics similar to the opposite area on the island of Pemba with deep soils and hilly terrain. Makoongwe is inhabited and people do farming and fishing.
*Matumbini - is an islet with dense mangrove forest and popular among fishermen due to the presence of rich coral reef.
*Misali - has a rich coral reef, and has been declared a marine reserve. 
*Mwangi - is a small islet close to Mtambwe on the main island of Pemba.
*Panza - is the southernmost island in Pemba and in fact is a series of islets but a bridge connects the two main parts of Mtondooni and Panza proper. Its topography is coral on the Panza side and deep soil on the Mtondooni part. Its inhabitants do farming and fishing.
*Vikunguni - is a small islet close to the north-west group of islands.
*Yombi - is a small islet east of Panza island.

===Important Bird Area===
Pemba has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Pemba green pigeons, Pemba scops owls, Pemba white-eyes and Pemba sunbirds.

==Climate==
Pemba has a tropical climate, yet somewhat milder than Tanzania&#x27;s mainland and milder than in Unguja island. This climate is classified as &quot;Aw&quot; by the Köppen-Geiger system. The average temperature in Chake Chake is . The average annual rainfall is 1,364 mm. The monthly average temperatures are usually between . There are two rain seasons, with most rainfall coming between April and May and smaller rain season coming between November and December. Drier months are January and February, and a longer drier season between June and October.

==Archaeology==
Archaeological research on Pemba has shown its centrality to the Swahili coast trading system as early as 600 AD. Along the northern coast, urban settlements at Chwaka later developed and flourished from the eleventh century to ~1500 AD.

West of Pemba&#x27;s capital Chake-Chake, on a long stretched peninsula called Ras Mkumbuu, one can find some of the oldest and best preserved series of early ruins on the islands (&quot;Ndagoni ruins&quot;, probably 14th century).

East of Chake-Chake one can find the &quot;Mkama Ndume ruins&quot; at Pujini village (south of the airport) within easy reach by road from Chake-Chake. This is the only known early fortification on the whole Swahili Coast; it is dated to the fifteenth century.

==History==

According to the Arab geographer Yakut, in the mid-13th century there were two independent sultans ruling over parts of Pemba Island.

On 24 June 2016, the Australian Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Darren Chester, said that a piece of aircraft debris was found on Pemba Island, possibly being from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

==Administration==

Pemba is part of the semi-autonomous Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar. Administratively, it is divided into two regions, North Pemba (Pemba Kaskazini)with its capital at Wete, and South Pemba (Pemba Kusini) with its capital at Mkoani. Although the centrally located city of Chake Chake, near the airport, is considered Pemba&#x27;s capital, and is the seat of Pemba&#x27;s court and the President of Zanzibar&#x27;s official Pemba residence.

==Economy==

===Fishing===
Pemba is also famous for its rich fishing grounds. Between the island and the mainland there is the deep 50 kilometre wide Pemba Channel, which is one of the most profitable fishing grounds for game fishing on the Swahili Coast.

===Farming and agriculture===
Pemba is (with the exception of a strip of land along its eastern coast) highly fertile for agriculture which serves the global farming industry.

====Cash crops====
A large segment of Zanzibar export earnings comes from cloves. The greatest concentration of clove trees in Zanzibar is found on Pemba (3.5 million trees), as growing conditions on the island are superior to those on Unguja island. Clove trees grow to a height of approximately 10 to 15 metres and can be harvested for sometimes over 50 years. Most of the island, which is hillier and more fertile than Unguja, is dominated by small scale farming. There is also large-scale farming of other crops, primarily rice, coconuts, and red beans (called maharagwe in Swahili), as well as cassava and bananas.

===Land surveying===

For the promotion of tourism, the Department of Surveys and Mapping at Chake-Chake has been publishing maps with tourist guides since 1992.
==Transport==

===Airport===
Pemba Airport is also known as Wawi Airport or Karume Airport and connects the island to Arusha, Dar es Salaam, and Zanzibar City.

<text>A pentacle (also spelled and pronounced as &quot;pantacle&quot; in Thelema, following Aleister Crowley, though that spelling ultimately derived from Éliphas Lévi) is a talisman that is used in magical evocation, and is usually made of parchment, paper, cloth, or metal (although it can be of other materials), upon which a magical design is drawn. Symbols may also be included (sometimes on the reverse), a common one being the six-point form of the Seal of Solomon.

Pentacles may be sewn to the chest of one&#x27;s garment, or may be flat objects that hang from one&#x27;s neck or are placed flat upon the ground or altar. Pentacles are almost always shaped as disks or flat circles. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, though, a pentacle is placed within the triangle of evocation.

Many varieties of pentacle can be found in the grimoire called the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;. Pentacles are also used in the neopagan magical religion called Wicca, alongside other magical tools. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Wicca, pentacles symbolize the classical element earth. In the 1909 Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck (the pentacles of which were designed by Arthur Edward Waite), and subsequent tarot decks that are based upon it, and in Wicca, pentacles prominently incorporate a pentagram in their design. This form of pentacle is formed upon a disk which may be used either upon an altar or as a sacred space of its own.

==Definitions==
The first documents to depict pentacles were the 16th-century grimoires called the &quot;Heptameron&quot; by pseudo-Pietro d&#x27;Abano, and the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;. In the &quot;Heptaméron&quot;, there is only one pentacle, whereas in the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, there are dozens of different pentacles. The &quot;Heptameron&quot; pentacle is a hexagram that is embellished by patee crosses and letters, whereas the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; pentacles have a very broad variety of designs, only two of which are pentagrammic. That contrasts with the later popular definitions of pentacles from the 1900s, which state that pentacles are inherently pentagrammic.

Gerald Gardner, known by some as the &#x27;Father of Wicca&#x27;, got his concept of pentacles in large part from the 1909 Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck, in which the pentacles are disks that are covered with a pentagram. In Gardner&#x27;s 1949 book &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot; and 1954 book &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot;, Gardner defined a pentacle as a &quot;five-pointed star&quot;, intending to mean a pentagram. In his 1959 book &quot;The Meaning of Witchcraft&quot;, Gardner defined a pentacle as a synonym of &#x27;pentagram&#x27;.

There is a particular definition of &#x27;pentacle&#x27; among many latter-day Wiccans: Namely, a &#x27;pentacle&#x27; refers to a &#x27;pentagram&#x27; circumscribed by a circle.

== Etymology ==

The word is first recorded in English usage in 1561, from earlier French use. The French word had the meaning of &quot;talisman&quot;. The French word is in turn from the Latinized word &#x27;pentaculum&#x27; (using the Latin diminutive suffix &quot;-culum&quot;), which is in turn from the Italian word &#x27;pentacolo&#x27;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in earlier editions (2nd edition 1989) went on to say that &quot;some would connect it&quot; with the Middle French word &#x27;pentacol&#x27; (1328) or &#x27;pendacol&#x27; (1418), a jewel or ornament worn around the neck (from &quot;pend-&quot; hang, &quot;à&quot; to, &quot;col&quot; or &quot;cou&quot; neck). This is the derivation the Theosophical Society employ in their glossary:

...it seems most likely that it comes through Italian and French from the root pend- &quot;to hang&quot;, and so is equivalent to a pendant or charm hung about the neck. From the fact that one form of pentacle was the pentagram or star-pentagon, the word itself has been connected with the Greek pente (five).

==As magical objects==
&quot;Pentacles&quot;, despite the sound of the word, often had no connotation of &quot;five&quot; in the old magical texts, but were, rather, magical talismans inscribed with any symbol or character. When they incorporated star-shaped figures, these were more often hexagrams than pentagrams. Pentacles showing a great variety of shapes and images appear in the old magical grimoires, such as the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;; as Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa summarises it, their use was to &quot;fore-know all future things, &amp; command whole nature, have power over devils, and Angels, and do miracles.&quot; Agrippa attributes Moses&#x27; feats of magic in part to his knowledge of various pentacles.

A &quot;Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy&quot; (c. 1565), which was falsely attributed to Agrippa, gives detailed instructions as to how pentacles should be formulated:

But we now come to speak of the holy and sacred Pentacles and Sigils. Now these pentacles, are as it were certain holy signes preserving us from evil chances and events, and helping and assisting us to binde, exterminate, and drive away evil spirits, and alluring the good spirits, and reconciling them unto us. And these pentacles do consist either of Characters of the good spirits of the superiour order, or of sacred pictures of holy letters or revelations, with apt and fit versicles, which are composed either of Geometrical figures and holy names of God, according to the course and maner of many of them; or they are compounded of all of them, or very many of them mixt.

Francis Barrett, in his influential work &quot;The Magus&quot; of 1801 (Book 2, part 2), repeats these instructions almost verbatim.

Another common design employed in pentacles is a magic square, such as the Sator-Arepo-Tenet square.

In the Golden Dawn magical system, the Earth Pentacle is one of four elemental &quot;weapons&quot; or tools of an Adept. These weapons are &quot;symbolical representations of the forces employed for the manifestation of the inner self, the elements required for the incarnation of the divine.&quot;

Other pentacles for the evocation of spirits are also employed in the Golden Dawn system; these are engraved with the name and sigil of the spirit to be invoked, inside three concentric circles, having painted on their reverse a circle and cross like a celtic cross.

According to Aleister Crowley&#x27;s instructions for the A∴A∴, the pentacle is a disc of wax, gold, silver-gilt or Electrum Magicum, eight inches diameter and half an inch thick; the Neophyte should &quot;by his understanding and ingenium devise a symbol to represent the Universe&quot;, and engrave this on the disc.

There is, therefore, nothing movable or immovable under the whole firmament of heaven which is not included in this pantacle, though it be but &quot;eight inches in diameter, and in thickness half an inch.&quot; Fire is not matter at all; water is a combination of elements; air almost entirely a mixture of elements; earth contains all both in admixture and in combination. So must it be with this Pantacle, the symbol of earth.

A pentacle is also employed as a magical tool within Wicca, generally to summon certain energies or summon spirits.

===Method of employment===
In many old grimoires dealing with magical evocation, the pentacle is described as being hung about the neck, providing protection and authority to the operator. Johannes Trithemius has the magician donning the pentacle just before casting the protective circle:

Then taking your ring and pentacle, put the ring on the little finger of your right hand; hang the pentacle round thy neck; (Note, the pentacle may be either wrote on clean virgin parchment, or engraven on a square plate of silver and suspended from thy neck to the breast)...

One version of the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; mentions both a &quot;Great Pentacle&quot; which is drawn in a book, as well as a collection of other pentacles which are drawn in ink on separate pieces of parchment for use as amulets:

Thou shalt preserve them to suspend from thy neck, whichever thou wilt, on the day and hour wherein thou wast born, after which thou shalt take heed to name every day ten times, the Name which is hung from thy neck, turning towards the East, and thou mayest be assured that no enchantment or any other danger shall have power to harm thee.

The pentacle is of central importance in the evocation of spirits. A fairly typical evocation involves a series of conjurations of increasing potency, each involving the display of the pentacle:

&lt;poem&gt;... If they then immediately appear, it is well; if not, let the master uncover the consecrated pentacles which he should have made to constrain and command the spirits, and which he should wear fastened round his neck, holding the medals (or pentacles) in his left hand, and the consecrated knife in his right; and encouraging his companions, he shall say with a loud voice:

: Here be the symbols of secret things, the standards, the ensigns, and the banners, of God the conqueror; and the arms of the almighty One, to compel the aerial potencies. I command ye absolutely by their power and virtue that ye come near unto us, into our presence, from whatsoever part of the world ye may be in, and that ye delay not to obey us in all things wherein we shall command ye by the virtue of God the mighty One. Come ye promptly, and delay not to appear, and answer us with humility.

If they appear at this time, show them the pentacles, and receive them with kindness, gentleness, and courtesy; reason and speak with them, question them, and ask from them all things which thou hast proposed to demand.

But if, on the contrary, they do not yet make their appearance, holding the consecrated knife in the right hand, and the pentacles being uncovered by the removal of their consecrated covering, strike and beat the air with the knife as if wishing to commence a combat, comfort and exhort thy companions, and then in a loud and stern voice repeat the following conjuration: ...&lt;/poem&gt;

Once the spirit has appeared and been constrained, the pentacle is covered again, but is uncovered whenever demands are made of the spirit or when it is compelled to depart.

In the Golden Dawn system, the pentacles are not suspended from the neck, but wrapped in a cloth covering. Instead of wearing a pentacle, the magician wears fastened to their breast a lamen.

==In tarot==
Much like conventional playing cards, the Minor Arcana of the tarot are divided into four suits. The suit names have evolved over time, and based on the innovation of Éliphas Lévi, contemporary English-language writers on tarot divination often prefer &quot;pentacles&quot; for the suit of coins.

The 1909 Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck was the first to use an &quot;actual&quot; suit of pentacles, where Arthur Edward Waite designed the pentacles as golden disks with a pentagram on them. The influence of that deck resulted in widespread use of the pentacle symbol, particularly among Wiccans.

==In mathematics==
The term &quot;pentacle&quot; is used in &quot;Tilings and patterns&quot; by Branko Grünbaum and G. C. Shephard to indicate a five-pointed star composed of ten line segments, similar to a pentagram but containing no interior lines.

<text>The Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) is a species of passerine bird in the crow family Corvidae. It has pinkish brown plumage with a black stripe on each side of a whitish throat, a bright blue panel on the upper wing and a black tail. The Eurasian jay is a woodland bird that occurs over a vast region from western Europe and north-west Africa to the Indian subcontinent and further to the eastern seaboard of Asia and down into south-east Asia. Across this vast range, several distinct racial forms have evolved which look different from each other, especially when comparing forms at the extremes of its range.

The bird is called [[jay]], without any epithets, by English speakers in Great Britain and Ireland.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Eurasian jay was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Corvus glandarius&quot;. Linnaeus specified the locality as &quot;Europa&quot; but this was restricted to Sweden by Ernst Hartert in 1903. The Eurasian jay is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Garrulus&quot; that was established in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name &quot;Garrulus&quot; is a Latin word meaning &quot;chattering&quot;, &quot;babbling&quot; or &quot;noisy&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;glandarius&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of acorns&quot;.

Eight racial groups (33 subspecies in total) were recognised by Steve Madge &amp; Hilary Burn in 1994: 
* the nominate group (nine European races), with a streaked .
* the &quot;cervicalis&quot; group (three races in North Africa), with a rufous nape, grey , very pale head sides, and a streaked or black crown.
* the &quot;atricapillus&quot; group (four races in Middle East, Crimea &amp; Turkey), with a uniform mantle &amp; nape, black crown and very pale face.
* the race &quot;hyrcanus&quot; (Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of Iran), small with black forecrown and broadly streaked hindcrown.
* the &quot;brandtii&quot; group (four races in Siberia and northern Japan), with a streaked crown, reddish head, dark iris and grey mantle.
* the &quot;leucotis&quot; group (two races in south-east Asia), with no white in the wing, a white forecrown, black hindcrown and much white on the sides of the head.
* the &quot;bispecularis&quot; group (six races in the Himalayan region), with an unstreaked rufous crown, and no white wing-patch.
* the &quot;japonicus&quot; group (four races in the southern Japanese islands), with a large white wing-patch, blackish face and scaled crown.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Birdlife International split the Eurasian jay into three species. The subspecies &quot;G. g. leucotis&quot; becomes the white-face jay (&quot;Garrulus leucotis&quot;) and the &quot;bispecularis&quot; group containing six subspecies becomes the plain-crowned jay (&quot;Garrulus bispecularis&quot;).

==Description==
The Eurasian jay is a relatively small corvid, similar in size to a western jackdaw (&quot;Coloeus monedula&quot;) with a length of and a wingspan of . The nominate race has light rufous brown to a pinkish brown body plumage. The whitish throat is bordered on each side by a prominent black moustache stripe. The forehead and crown are whitish with black stripes. The rump is white. The complex colouring on the upper surface of the wing includes black and white bars and a prominent bright blue patch with fine black bars. The tail is mainly black.

===Voice===

The most characteristic call is a harsh, rasping screech that is used upon sighting various predators and as an advertising call. The jay is well known for its mimicry, often sounding so like a different species that it is difficult to distinguish its true identity unless the bird is seen. It will imitate the calls of birds of prey such as the mew of the common buzzard and the cackle of the northern goshawk.

==Distribution and habitat==
A member of the widespread jay group, it inhabits mixed woodland, particularly with oaks, and is a habitual acorn hoarder. In recent years, the bird has begun to migrate into urban areas, possibly as a result of continued erosion of its woodland habitat. Before humans began planting the trees commercially on a wide scale, Eurasian jays were the main source of movement and propagation for the European oak (&quot;Q. robur&quot;), each bird having the ability to spread more than a thousand acorns each year. Eurasian jays will also bury the acorns of other oak species, and have been cited by the National Trust as a major propagator of the largest population of holm oak (&quot;Q. ilex&quot;) in Northern Europe, situated in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. Jays have been recorded carrying single acorns as far as 20 km, and are credited with the rapid northward spread of oaks following the last ice age.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Eurasian jays normally first breed when two years of age, although they occasionally breed when only one year. Both sexes build the nest which is usually placed in a fork or on a branch of a tree close to the main trunk at a height of above the ground. Very occasionally the nest is located on a building. The nest has a base of twigs in diameter and a lining of thinner twigs, roots, grass, moss and leaves. The eggs are laid daily, normally early in the morning. The clutch is 3–6 eggs which are pale green to pale olive brown and are covered with fine darker speckles. They sometimes have brown or black streaks concentrated at the broader end. The eggs are and weigh around . They are incubated by the female and hatch after 16–19 days. While the female is on the nest the male brings her food. Both parents feed and care for the young which fledge after 19–23 days. The parents continue to feed the fledgelings until they are 6–8 weeks of age. Only a single brood is raised each year.

The maximum recorded age is 16 years and 9 months for a bird in Skelton, York, United Kingdom, that was ringed in 1966 and found dead in 1983.

===Diet===
Feeding in both trees and on the ground, it takes a wide range of invertebrates including many pest insects, acorns (oak seeds, which it buries for use during winter), beech and other seeds, fruits such as blackberries and rowan berries, young birds and eggs, bats, and small rodents. Like most species, the jay&#x27;s diet changes with the seasons but is noteworthy for its prolific caching of food—especially oak acorns and beechnuts—for winter and spring. While caching occurs throughout the year, it is most intense in the autumn.

===Health===
In order to keep its plumage free from parasites, it lies on top of anthills with spread wings and lets its feathers be sprayed with formic acid.

===Intelligence===
Similar to other corvids, Eurasian jays have been reported to plan for future needs. Male Eurasian jays also take into account the desires of their partner when sharing food with her as a courtship ritual and when protecting food items from thieving conspecifics.

<doc id="213351" wikidata="Q193176" url="?curid=213351" title="Coccyx">
<text>The coccyx (: coccyges or coccyxes), commonly referred to as the tailbone, is the final segment of the vertebral column in all apes, and analogous structures in certain other mammals such as horses. In tailless primates (e.g. humans and other great apes) since &quot;Nacholapithecus&quot; (a Miocene hominoid), the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail. In animals with bony tails, it is known as &quot;tailhead&quot; or &quot;dock&quot;, in bird anatomy as &quot;tailfan&quot;. It comprises three to five separate or fused coccygeal vertebrae below the sacrum, attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, the sacrococcygeal symphysis, which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx.

== Structure ==

The coccyx is formed of three, four or five rudimentary vertebrae. It articulates superiorly with the sacrum. In each of the first three segments may be traced a rudimentary body and articular and transverse processes; the last piece (sometimes the third) is a mere nodule of bone. The transverse processes are most prominent and noticeable on the first coccygeal segment. All the segments lack pedicles, laminae and spinous processes. The first segment is the largest; it resembles the lowest sacral vertebra, and often exists as a separate piece; the remaining ones diminish in size rostrally.

Most anatomy books incorrectly state that the coccyx is normally fused in adults. It has been shown that the coccyx may, in some people, consist of up to five separate bony segments, the most common configuration being two or three segments.

=== Surfaces ===
The anterior surface is slightly concave and marked with three transverse grooves which indicate the junctions of the different segments. It gives attachment to the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament and the levatores ani and supports part of the rectum. The posterior surface is convex, marked by transverse grooves similar to those on the anterior surface, and presents on either side a linear row of tubercles – the undeveloped articular processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. Of these, the superior pair are the largest, and are called the coccygeal cornua they project caudally, and articulate with the cornua of the sacrum, and on either side complete the foramen for the transmission of the posterior division of the fifth sacral nerve.

=== Borders ===
The lateral borders are thin and exhibit a series of small bony protrusions, which represent the transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. Of these, the first is the largest; it is flattened anteriorly, and often extends to join the lower part of the thin lateral edge of the sacrum, thus completing the foramen for the transmission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve; the others diminish in size from caudally, and are often lacking. The borders of the coccyx are narrow, and give attachment on either side to the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, to the coccygeus and levator ani in front of the ligaments, and to the gluteus maximus behind them.

=== Apex ===
The apex is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the external anal sphincter; it may be divided in two.

=== Coccygeal fossa ===
The coccygeal fossa is a shallow depression on the posterior surface between the sacrum and the perineum, located in the intergluteal cleft that runs from just below the sacrum to the perineum. It is not consistently present in all humans. The coccygeal fossa marks the deepest part of the pelvic floor, next to the coccyx. The levator ani has its origin here.

=== Extensor coccygis ===
The extensor coccygis is a slender muscle fascicle, which is not always present. It extends over the caudal portion of the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx. It arises by tendinous fibers from the last segment of the sacrum, or first piece of the coccyx, and passes downward to be inserted into the lower part of the coccyx. It is an evolutionary relic of the extensor muscle of the caudal vertebrae of other animals, enabling limited coccygeal motion.

=== Sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal joints ===
The joints are variable and may be: (1) synovial joints; (2) thin discs of fibrocartilage; (3) intermediate between these two; (4) ossified.

===Attachments===
The anterior side of the coccyx has attachments to the levator ani muscle, coccygeus, iliococcygeus, and pubococcygeus, anococcygeal raphe. Attached to the posterior side is the gluteus maximus, which extends the thigh at the hip joint. The ligaments attached to the coccyx include the anterior and posterior sacrococcygeal ligaments which are the continuations of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments that extend along the entire spine. The lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve. Some fibers of the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments (arising from the spine of the ischium and the ischial tuberosity respectively) also attach to the coccyx. An extension of the pia mater, the filum terminale, extends from the apex of the conus, and inserts on the coccyx.

== Function ==
The coccyx is not entirely useless in humans, because it has attachments to various muscles, tendons and ligaments. However, these muscles, tendons and ligaments are also attached at many other points, to stronger structures than the coccyx. It is doubtful that the coccyx attachments are important to the well-being of humans, given the large number of coccygectomy procedures performed annually to treat coccydynia. Reviews of studies covering more than 700 coccygectomies found the operation was successful in relieving pain in 84% of cases. 12% of the time, the only major complication faced was infection due to the proximity to the anus. One notable complication of coccygectomy is an increased risk of perineal hernia.

== Clinical significance ==
Injuring the coccyx can give rise to a painful condition called coccydynia and one or more of the bones or the connections thereof may be broken, fractured tailbone. A number of tumors are known to involve the coccyx; of these, the most common is sacrococcygeal teratoma. Both coccydynia and coccygeal tumors may require surgical removal of the coccyx (coccygectomy). One very rare complication of coccygectomy is a type of perineal hernia known as a coccygeal hernia.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;coccyx&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek word &quot;cuckoo&quot;; the latter is attested in the writings of the Greek physician Herophilus to denote the end of the vertebral column. This Greek name for the cuckoo was applied as the last three or four bones of the coccyx resemble the beak of this bird, when viewed from the side.

This established etymological explanation can also be found in the writings of the 16th century anatomist Andreas Vesalius who wrote: &quot;os cuculi, a similitudine rostri cuculi avis&quot; (the cuckoo bone shows a likeness to the beak of the cuckoo bird). Vesalius used the Latin expression &quot;os cuculi&quot;, with &quot;os&quot;, bone and &quot;cuculus&quot;, the Latin name for the cuckoo. The 16th/17th century French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger gives a rather hilarious etymological explanation, as he writes: &quot;quia crepitus, qui per sedimentum exeunt, ad is os allisi, cuculi vocis similitudinem effingunt&quot; (because the sound of the farts that leave the anus and dash against this bone, shows a likeness to the call of the cuckoo). Riolan&#x27;s explanation is not considered credible.

Besides &quot;os cuculi&quot;, &quot;os caudae&quot;, with &quot;caudae&quot;, of the tail is attested. This Latin expression might be the source of the English, French language, German and Dutch terms &quot;tailbone&quot;, , and &quot;&quot;. In the current official anatomic Latin nomenclature, &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, &quot;coccyx&quot; and &quot;os coccygis&quot; is used.

<text>Positive feedback (exacerbating feedback, self-reinforcing feedback) is a process that occurs in a feedback loop where the outcome of a process reinforces the inciting process to build momentum. As such, these forces can exacerbate the effects of a small disturbance. That is, the effects of a perturbation on a system include an increase in the magnitude of the perturbation. That is, Aproduces more ofBwhich in turn produces more ofA. In contrast, a system in which the results of a change act to reduce or counteract it has negative feedback. Both concepts play an important role in science and engineering, including biology, chemistry, and cybernetics.

Mathematically, positive feedback is defined as a positive loop gain around a closed loop of cause and effect.
That is, positive feedback is in phase with the input, in the sense that it adds to make the input larger.
Positive feedback tends to cause system instability. When the loop gain is positive and above 1, there will typically be exponential growth, increasing oscillations, chaotic behavior or other divergences from . System parameters will typically accelerate towards extreme values, which may damage or destroy the system, or may end with the system latched into a new stable state. Positive feedback may be controlled by signals in the system being filtered, damped, or limited, or it can be cancelled or reduced by adding negative feedback.

Positive feedback is used in digital electronics to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27; states. On the other hand, thermal runaway is a type of positive feedback that can destroy semiconductor junctions. Positive feedback in chemical reactions can increase the rate of reactions, and in some cases can lead to explosions. Positive feedback in mechanical design causes tipping-point, or over-centre, mechanisms to snap into position, for example in switches and locking pliers. Out of control, it can cause bridges to collapse. Positive feedback in economic systems can cause boom-then-bust cycles. A familiar example of positive feedback is the loud squealing or howling sound produced by audio feedback in public address systems: the microphone picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again.

== Overview ==
Positive feedback enhances or amplifies an effect by it having an influence on the process which gave rise to it. For example, when part of an electronic output signal returns to the input, and is in phase with it, the system gain is increased. The feedback from the outcome to the originating process can be direct, or it can be via other state variables. Such systems can give rich qualitative behaviors, but whether the feedback is instantaneously positive or negative in sign has an extremely important influence on the results. Positive feedback reinforces and negative feedback moderates the original process. &quot;Positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; in this sense refer to loop gains greater than or less than zero, and do not imply any value judgements as to the desirability of the outcomes or effects. A key feature of positive feedback is thus that small disturbances get bigger. When a change occurs in a system, positive feedback causes further change, in the same direction.

=== Basic ===
A simple feedback loop is shown in the diagram. If the loop gain AB is positive, then a condition of &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;regenerative&quot; feedback exists.

If the functions A and B are linear and AB is smaller than unity, then the overall system gain from the input to output is finite but can be very large as AB approaches unity. In that case, it can be shown that the overall or loop gain from input to output is:

:formula_1

When AB &gt; 1, the system is unstable, so does not have a well-defined gain; the gain may be called infinite.

Thus depending on the feedback, state changes can be convergent, or divergent. The result of positive feedback is to changes, so that small perturbations may result in big changes.

A system in equilibrium in which there is positive feedback to any change from its current state may be unstable, in which case the system is said to be in an unstable equilibrium. The magnitude of the forces that act to move such a system away from its equilibrium is an increasing function of the &quot;distance&quot; of the state from the equilibrium.

Positive feedback does not necessarily imply instability of an equilibrium, for example stable &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states may exist in positive-feedback architectures.

=== Hysteresis ===


In the real world, positive feedback loops typically do not cause ever-increasing growth but are modified by limiting effects of some sort. According to Donella Meadows:

::&quot;Positive feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. A system with an unchecked positive loop ultimately will destroy itself. That&#x27;s why there are so few of them. Usually, a negative loop will kick in sooner or later.&quot;

Hysteresis, in which the starting point affects where the system ends up, can be generated by positive feedback. When the gain of the feedback loop is above 1, then the output moves away from the input: if it is above the input, then it moves towards the nearest positive limit, while if it is below the input then it moves towards the nearest negative limit.

Once it reaches the limit, it will be stable. However, if the input goes past the limit, then the feedback will change sign and the output will move in the opposite direction until it hits the opposite limit. The system therefore shows bistable behaviour.

== Terminology ==
The terms &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; were first applied to feedback before World War II. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the regenerative circuit.

 described regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where &quot;the &quot;feed-back&quot; action is positive&quot; in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mention only in passing. Harold Stephen Black&#x27;s classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black:
::&quot;Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative feed-back reduces it.&quot;
According to confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:
::&quot;...Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between &#x27;positive feed-back&#x27; and &#x27;negative feed-back&#x27;, based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier&#x27;s gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black&#x27;s work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition.&quot;

These confusions, along with the everyday associations of positive with &quot;good&quot; and negative with &quot;bad&quot;, have led many systems theorists to propose alternative terms. For example, Donella Meadows prefers the terms &quot;reinforcing&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot; feedbacks.

== Examples and applications ==

=== In electronics ===

Regenerative circuits were invented and patented in 1914 for the amplification and reception of very weak radio signals. Carefully controlled positive feedback around a single transistor amplifier can multiply its gain by 1,000 or more. Therefore, a signal can be amplified 20,000 or even 100,000 times in one stage, that would normally have a gain of only 20 to 50. The problem with regenerative amplifiers working at these very high gains is that they easily become unstable and start to oscillate. The radio operator has to be prepared to tweak the amount of feedback fairly continuously for good reception. Modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne design, with many more amplification stages, but much more stable operation and no positive feedback.

The oscillation that can break out in a regenerative radio circuit is used in electronic oscillators. By the use of tuned circuits or a piezoelectric crystal (commonly quartz), the signal that is amplified by the positive feedback remains linear and sinusoidal. There are several designs for such harmonic oscillators, including the Armstrong oscillator, Hartley oscillator, Colpitts oscillator, and the Wien bridge oscillator. They all use positive feedback to create oscillations.

Many electronic circuits, especially amplifiers, incorporate negative feedback. This reduces their gain, but improves their linearity, input impedance, output impedance, and bandwidth, and stabilises all of these parameters, including the loop gain. These parameters also become less dependent on the details of the amplifying device itself, and more dependent on the feedback components, which are less likely to vary with manufacturing tolerance, age and temperature. The difference between positive and negative feedback for AC signals is one of phase: if the signal is fed back out of phase, the feedback is negative and if it is in phase the feedback is positive. One problem for amplifier designers who use negative feedback is that some of the components of the circuit will introduce phase shift in the feedback path. If there is a frequency (usually a high frequency) where the phase shift reaches 180°, then the designer must ensure that the amplifier gain at that frequency is very low (usually by low-pass filtering). If the loop gain (the product of the amplifier gain and the extent of the positive feedback) at any frequency is greater than one, then the amplifier will oscillate at that frequency (Barkhausen stability criterion). Such oscillations are sometimes called parasitic oscillations. An amplifier that is stable in one set of conditions can break into parasitic oscillation in another. This may be due to changes in temperature, supply voltage, adjustment of front-panel controls, or even the proximity of a person or other conductive item.

Amplifiers may oscillate gently in ways that are hard to detect without an oscilloscope, or the oscillations may be so extensive that only a very distorted or no required signal at all gets through, or that damage occurs. Low frequency parasitic oscillations have been called &#x27;motorboating&#x27; due to the similarity to the sound of a low-revving exhaust note.

Many common digital electronic circuits employ positive feedback. While normal simple Boolean logic gates usually rely simply on gain to push digital signal voltages away from intermediate values to the values that are meant to represent Boolean &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27;, but many more complex gates use feedback. When an input voltage is expected to vary in an analogue way, but sharp thresholds are required for later digital processing, the Schmitt trigger circuit uses positive feedback to ensure that if the input voltage creeps gently above the threshold, the output is forced smartly and rapidly from one logic state to the other. One of the corollaries of the Schmitt trigger&#x27;s use of positive feedback is that, should the input voltage move gently down again past the same threshold, the positive feedback will hold the output in the same state with no change. This effect is called hysteresis: the input voltage has to drop past a different, lower threshold to &#x27;un-latch&#x27; the output and reset it to its original digital value. By reducing the extent of the positive feedback, the hysteresis-width can be reduced, but it can not entirely be eradicated. The Schmitt trigger is, to some extent, a latching circuit.

An electronic flip-flop, or &quot;latch&quot;, or &quot;bistable multivibrator&quot;, is a circuit that due to high positive feedback is not stable in a balanced or intermediate state. Such a bistable circuit is the basis of one bit of electronic memory. The flip-flop uses a pair of amplifiers, transistors, or logic gates connected to each other so that positive feedback maintains the state of the circuit in one of two unbalanced stable states after the input signal has been removed until a suitable alternative signal is applied to change the state. Computer random access memory (RAM) can be made in this way, with one latching circuit for each bit of memory.

Thermal runaway occurs in electronic systems because some aspect of a circuit is allowed to pass more current when it gets hotter, then the hotter it gets, the more current it passes, which heats it some more and so it passes yet more current. The effects are usually catastrophic for the device in question. If devices have to be used near to their maximum power-handling capacity, and thermal runaway is possible or likely under certain conditions, improvements can usually be achieved by careful design.

Audio and video systems can demonstrate positive feedback. If a microphone picks up the amplified sound output of loudspeakers in the same circuit, then howling and screeching sounds of audio feedback (at up to the maximum power capacity of the amplifier) will be heard, as random noise is re-amplified by positive feedback and filtered by the characteristics of the audio system and the room.

===Audio and live music===
Audio feedback (also known as acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) is a special kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a loudly-amplified loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.

Feedback is almost always considered undesirable when it occurs with a singer&#x27;s or public speaker&#x27;s microphone at an event using a sound reinforcement system or PA system. Audio engineers use various electronic devices, such as equalizers and, since the 1990s, automatic feedback detection devices to prevent these unwanted squeals or screeching sounds, which detract from the audience&#x27;s enjoyment of the event. On the other hand, since the 1960s, electric guitar players in rock music bands using loud guitar amplifiers and distortion effects have intentionally created guitar feedback to create a desirable musical effect. &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; by the Beatles marks one of the earliest examples of the use of feedback as a recording effect in popular music. It starts with a single, percussive feedback note produced by plucking the A string on Lennon&#x27;s guitar. Artists such as the Kinks and the Who had already used feedback live, but Lennon remained proud of the fact that the Beatles were perhaps the first group to deliberately put it on vinyl. In one of his last interviews, he said, &quot;I defy anybody to find a record—unless it&#x27;s some old blues record in 1922—that uses feedback that way.&quot;

The principles of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist Søren Absalon Larsen. Microphones are not the only transducers subject to this effect. Record deck pickup cartridges can do the same, usually in the low-frequency range below about 100 Hz, manifesting as a low rumble. Jimi Hendrix was an innovator in the intentional use of guitar feedback in his guitar solos to create unique sound effects. He helped develop the controlled and musical use of audio feedback in electric guitar playing, and later Brian May was a famous proponent of the technique.

===Video===
Similarly, if a video camera is pointed at a monitor screen that is displaying the camera&#x27;s own signal, then repeating patterns can be formed on the screen by positive feedback. This video feedback effect was used in the opening sequences to the first ten series of the television program &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

=== Switches ===
In electrical switches, including bimetallic strip based thermostats, the switch usually has hysteresis in the switching action. In these cases hysteresis is mechanically achieved via positive feedback within a tipping point mechanism. The positive feedback action minimises the length of time arcing occurs for during the switching and also holds the contacts in an open or closed state.

=== In biology ===

==== In physiology ====

A number of examples of positive feedback systems may be found in physiology.
* One example is the onset of contractions in childbirth, known as the Ferguson reflex. When a contraction occurs, the hormone oxytocin causes a nerve stimulus, which stimulates the hypothalamus to produce more oxytocin, which increases uterine contractions. This results in contractions increasing in amplitude and frequency.
* Another example is the process of blood clotting. The loop is initiated when injured tissue releases signal chemicals that activate platelets in the blood. An activated platelet releases chemicals to activate more platelets, causing a rapid cascade and the formation of a blood clot.
* Lactation also involves positive feedback in that as the baby suckles on the nipple there is a nerve response into the spinal cord and up into the hypothalamus of the brain, which then stimulates the pituitary gland to produce more prolactin to produce more milk.
* A spike in estrogen during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle causes ovulation.
* The generation of nerve signals is another example, in which the membrane of a nerve fibre causes slight leakage of sodium ions through sodium channels, resulting in a change in the membrane potential, which in turn causes more opening of channels, and so on (Hodgkin cycle). So a slight initial leakage results in an explosion of sodium leakage which creates the nerve action potential.
* In excitation–contraction coupling of the heart, an increase in intracellular calcium ions to the cardiac myocyte is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which transport calcium out into the cytosol in a positive feedback physiological response.

In most cases, such feedback loops culminate in counter-signals being released that suppress or break the loop. Childbirth contractions stop when the baby is out of the mother&#x27;s body. Chemicals break down the blood clot. Lactation stops when the baby no longer nurses.

==== In gene regulation ====

Positive feedback is a well-studied phenomenon in gene regulation, where it is most often associated with bistability. Positive feedback occurs when a gene activates itself directly or indirectly via a double negative feedback loop. Genetic engineers have constructed and tested simple positive feedback networks in bacteria to demonstrate the concept of bistability. A classic example of positive feedback is the lac operon in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Positive feedback plays an integral role in cellular differentiation, development, and cancer progression, and therefore, positive feedback in gene regulation can have significant physiological consequences. Random motions in molecular dynamics coupled with positive feedback can trigger interesting effects, such as create population of phenotypically different cells from the same parent cell. This happens because noise can become amplified by positive feedback. Positive feedback can also occur in other forms of cell signaling, such as enzyme kinetics or metabolic pathways.

==== In evolutionary biology ====

Positive feedback loops have been used to describe aspects of the dynamics of change in biological evolution. For example, beginning at the macro level, Alfred J. Lotka (1945) argued that the evolution of the species was most essentially a matter of selection that fed back energy flows to capture more and more energy for use by living systems. At the human level, Richard D. Alexander (1989) proposed that social competition between and within human groups fed back to the selection of intelligence thus constantly producing more and more refined human intelligence. Crespi (2004) discussed several other examples of positive feedback loops in evolution. The analogy of evolutionary arms races provides further examples of positive feedback in biological systems.
It has been shown that changes in biodiversity through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in demography and macrosociology) than with exponential and logistic models (traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. The hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth has been demonstrated (see below) to arise from second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a positive feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. It has been suggested that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend (produced by the positive feedback) with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.

==== Immune system ====

A cytokine storm, or hypercytokinemia is a potentially fatal immune reaction consisting of a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells, with highly elevated levels of various cytokines. In normal immune function, positive feedback loops can be utilized to enhance the action of B lymphocytes. When a B cell binds its antibodies to an antigen and becomes activated, it begins releasing antibodies and secreting a complement protein called C3. Both C3 and a B cell&#x27;s antibodies can bind to a pathogen, and when a B cell has its antibodies bind to a pathogen with C3, it speeds up that B cell&#x27;s secretion of more antibodies and more C3, thus creating a positive feedback loop.

==== Cell death ====

Apoptosis is a caspase-mediated process of cellular death, whose aim is the removal of long-lived or damaged cells. A failure of this process has been implicated in prominent conditions such as cancer or Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The very core of the apoptotic process is the auto-activation of caspases, which may be modelled via a positive-feedback loop. This positive feedback exerts an auto-activation of the effector caspase by means of intermediate caspases. When isolated from the rest of apoptotic pathway, this positive feedback presents only one stable steady state, regardless of the number of intermediate activation steps of the effector caspase. When this core process is complemented with inhibitors and enhancers of caspases effects, this process presents bistability, thereby modelling the alive and dying states of a cell.

=== In psychology ===

Winner (1996) described gifted children as driven by positive feedback loops involving setting their own learning course, this feeding back satisfaction, thus further setting their learning goals to higher levels and so on. Winner termed this positive feedback loop as a &quot;rage to master&quot;. Vandervert (2009a, 2009b) proposed that the child prodigy can be explained in terms of a positive feedback loop between the output of thinking/performing in working memory, which then is fed to the cerebellum where it is streamlined, and then fed back to working memory thus steadily increasing the quantitative and qualitative output of working memory. Vandervert also argued that this working memory/cerebellar positive feedback loop was responsible for language evolution in working memory.

=== In economics ===

====Markets with social influence====
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers&#x27; choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon (Matthew effect) where popular products tend to become even more popular.

====Market dynamics====
According to the theory of reflexivity advanced by George Soros, price changes are driven by a positive feedback process whereby investors&#x27; expectations are influenced by price movements so their behaviour acts to reinforce movement in that direction until it becomes unsustainable, whereupon the feedback drives prices in the opposite direction.

==== In social media ====

Programs such as Facebook and Twitter depend on positive feedback to create interest in topics and drive the take-up of the media.
In the age of smartphones and social media, the feedback loop has created a craze for virtual validation in the form of likes, shares, and FOMO (fear of missing out).
This is intensified by the use of bots which are designed to respond to particular words or themes and transmit posts more widely.
What is called negative feedback in social media should often be regarded as positive feedback in this context. Outrageous statements and negative comments often produce much more feedback than positive comments.

==== Systemic risk ====

Systemic risk is the risk that an amplification or leverage or positive feedback process presents to a system. This is usually unknown, and under certain conditions, this process can amplify exponentially and rapidly lead to destructive or chaotic behaviour. A Ponzi scheme is a good example of a positive-feedback system: funds from new investors are used to pay out unusually high returns, which in turn attract more new investors, causing rapid growth toward collapse. W. Brian Arthur has also studied and written on positive feedback in the economy (e.g. W. Brian Arthur, 1990). Hyman Minsky proposed a theory that certain credit expansion practices could make a market economy into &quot;a deviation amplifying system&quot; that could suddenly collapse, sometimes called a Minsky moment.

Simple systems that clearly separate the inputs from the outputs are not prone to systemic risk. This risk is more likely as the complexity of the system increases because it becomes more difficult to see or analyze all the possible combinations of variables in the system even under careful stress testing conditions. The more efficient a complex system is, the more likely it is to be prone to systemic risks because it takes only a small amount of deviation to disrupt the system. Therefore, well-designed complex systems generally have built-in features to avoid this condition, such as a small amount of friction, or resistance, or inertia, or time delay to decouple the outputs from the inputs within the system. These factors amount to an inefficiency, but they are necessary to avoid instabilities.

The 2010 Flash Crash incident was blamed on the practice of high-frequency trading (HFT), although whether HFT really increases systemic risk remains controversial.

==== Human population growth ====

Agriculture and human population can be considered to be in a positive feedback mode, which means that one drives the other with increasing intensity. It is suggested that this positive feedback system will end sometime with a catastrophe, as modern agriculture is using up all of the easily available phosphate and is resorting to highly efficient monocultures which are more susceptible to systemic risk.

Technological innovation and human population can be similarly considered, and this has been offered as an explanation for the apparent hyperbolic growth of the human population in the past, instead of a simpler exponential growth.
It is proposed that the growth rate is accelerating because of second-order positive feedback between population and technology. Technological growth increases the carrying capacity of land for people, which leads to a growing population, and this in turn drives further technological growth.

==== Prejudice, social institutions and poverty ====

Gunnar Myrdal described a vicious circle of increasing inequalities, and poverty, which is known as circular cumulative causation.

James Moody, Assistant Professor at Ohio State University, states that students who self-segregate or grow up in segregated environments have &quot;little meaningful exposure to other races because they never form relationships with students of another race...[; as a result...] they are viewing other racial groups at a social distance, which can bolster stereotypes,&quot; which ultimately causes a positive feedback loop in which segregated groups become more prejudiced, polarized, and segregated against each other, similar to that of political polarization.

=== In meteorology ===

Drought intensifies through positive feedback. A lack of rain decreases soil moisture, which kills plants or causes them to release less water through transpiration. Both factors limit evapotranspiration, the process by which water vapour is added to the atmosphere from the surface, and add dry dust to the atmosphere, which absorbs water. Less water vapour means both low dew point temperatures and more efficient daytime heating, decreasing the chances of humidity in the atmosphere leading to cloud formation. Lastly, without clouds, there cannot be rain, and the loop is complete.

=== In climatology ===
Climate &quot;forcings&quot; may push a climate system in the direction of warming or cooling, for example, increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases cause warming at the surface. Forcings are external to the climate system and feedbacks are internal processes of the system. Some feedback mechanisms act in relative isolation to the rest of the climate system while others are tightly coupled. Forcings, feedbacks and the dynamics of the climate system determine how much and how fast the climate changes. The main positive feedback in global warming is the tendency of warming to increase the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which in turn leads to further warming. The main negative feedback comes from the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the amount of heat radiated from the Earth into space is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere.

Other examples of positive feedback subsystems in climatology include:
* A warmer atmosphere melts ice, changing the albedo (surface reflectivity), which further warms the atmosphere.
* Methane hydrates can be unstable so that a warming ocean could release more methane, which is also a greenhouse gas. 
* Peat, occurring naturally in peat bogs, contains carbon. When peat dries it decomposes, and may additionally burn. Peat also releases nitrous oxide.
* Global warming affects the cloud distribution. Clouds at higher altitudes enhance the greenhouse effects, while low clouds mainly reflect back sunlight, having opposite effects on temperature.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report states that &quot;Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change.&quot;

=== In sociology ===

A self-fulfilling prophecy is a social positive feedback loop between beliefs and behaviour: if enough people believe that something is true, their behaviour can make it true, and observations of their behaviour may in turn increase belief. A classic example is a bank run.

Another sociological example of positive feedback is the network effect. When more people are encouraged to join a network this increases the reach of the network therefore the network expands ever more quickly. A viral video is an example of the network effect in which links to a popular video are shared and redistributed, ensuring that more people see the video and then re-publish the links. This is the basis for many social phenomena, including Ponzi schemes and chain letters. In many cases, population size is the limiting factor to the feedback effect.

=== In chemistry ===

If a chemical reaction causes the release of heat, and the reaction itself happens faster at higher temperatures, then there is a high likelihood of positive feedback. If the heat produced is not removed from the reactants fast enough, thermal runaway can occur and very quickly lead to a chemical explosion.

=== In conservation ===

Many wildlife are hunted for their parts which can be quite valuable. The closer to extinction that targeted species become, the higher the price there is on their parts.

<text>Peter Blake (born John Beattie Dempsey; 8 December 1948 – 21 July 2018) was a Scottish actor. Probably best known as the character Kirk St Moritz in the BBC sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot;, by John Sullivan, his other high-profile moments came through his playing of a &#x27;Fonz&#x27;-type character in Pepsi-Cola commercials which led to a hit record in 1977 &quot;Lipsmackin&#x27; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rollin&quot;, Andy Evol the disc-jockey in &quot;Agony&quot; with Maureen Lipman for LWT and in an episode of &quot;Taggart&quot; (&quot;Do or Die&quot;) as Sgt. Bill Kent. He also had a long association with &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; playing Frank-N-Furter over a thousand times between 1975 and 1994.

==Early life==
Peter Blake was born John Beattie Dempsey on 8 December 1948 in Selkirk, Scotland. He was always referred to by his parents as Ian, a Scottish Gaelic term for John. He began his career as an aspiring pop star before turning to acting; his first professional appearance was at the Edinburgh International Festival, in Frank Dunlop&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Pop Theatre&quot;&#x27; production of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; at the Assembly Hall, in 1966.

==Theatre==
Peter Blake trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and joined the Citizens&#x27; Theatre Company, performing in a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Michael Blakemore&#x27;s original production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; which opened in September 1967 at the Citizens&#x27; Theatre, Glasgow and, in August 1968, performed at The Lyceum, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival. After graduating in 1969, he worked briefly as a stage manager in several Soho strip clubs before he joined the international cast of Victor Spinetti&#x27;s Amsterdam production of &quot;Hair, in 1970,&quot; and subsequently played the role of Berger in the show&#x27;s national tour of The Netherlands.

<doc id="213361" wikidata="Q1430261" url="?curid=213361" title="Peter Blake (sailor)">
<text>Sir Peter James Blake (1 October 1948 – 5 December 2001) was a New Zealand yachtsman who won the 1989–1990 Whitbread Round the World Race, held the Jules Verne Trophy from 1994 to 1997 by setting the around the world sailing record as co-skipper of &quot;ENZA New Zealand&quot; along with Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, and led New Zealand to successive victories in the America&#x27;s Cup.

Blake was shot and killed by pirates while monitoring environment change on the Amazon River on 5 December 2001. He was 53 years old.

==Early life and education==
Blake was born in 1948 in Auckland, New Zealand, to artist and art director Brian Blake and photography engraver Joyce Wilson. He was the second of their four children. He grew up in the suburb of Bayswater and attended school at Bayswater School, Belmont Intermediate and Takapuna Grammar School.

Blake was passionate about sailing from an early age; he began sailing at the age of five in the family dinghy. At age 18, he and his brother built a keel yacht and won the 1967/68 New Zealand Junior Offshore Group Championship.

From 1966 to 1969, Blake studied mechanical engineering at the Auckland Technical Institute, and gained the New Zealand Certificate of Engineering.

==Sailing career==
In 1971, Blake began his international sailing career as watch leader on &quot;Ocean Spirit&quot; in the Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro race. &quot;Ocean Spirit&quot; won the race. The co-skippers of the yacht, Leslie Williams and Robin Knox-Johnston, recognised Blake&#x27;s abilities in leadership and seamanship and invited him to join their team for the first Whitbread Round the World Race.

===Whitbread Round the World Race===
Blake raced in the 1973–1974 Whitbread Round the World Race as watch captain on board the &quot;Burton Cutter&quot; skippered by Leslie Williams and Alan Smith. In the 1977–1978 race, Blake rejoined Williams and co-skipper Johnston on board &quot;Heaths Condor&quot;. While refitting the yacht in England after the race, Peter met Philippa (Pippa) Glanville and they married in Emsworth in August 1979.

For the 1981–1982 race, Blake mounted his own campaign as skipper of &quot;Ceramco New Zealand&quot;, a sloop designed by an up-and-coming naval architect called Bruce Farr. The campaign started well, but &quot;Ceramco&quot; lost its mast on the first leg, and Blake&#x27;s crew did well to finish the race in third place. He returned for the 1985–1986 race as one of the race favourites, skipper of &quot;Lion New Zealand&quot;, sponsored by the Lion Brewery, and came second.

He won the 1989–1990 Whitbread race, where he skippered &quot;Steinlager 2&quot; to an unprecedented clean sweep of line, handicap and overall honours on each of the race&#x27;s six legs.

===Jules Verne trophy===
In 1994, Blake and his co-skipper Robin Knox-Johnson succeeded in their second attempt at the Jules Verne Trophy, by achieving the fastest non-stop navigation of the world under sail on the yacht &quot;ENZA New Zealand&quot;. Their first attempt in 1993 had foundered after the yacht struck an unidentified floating object 26 days into the attempt. Their time was 74 days, 22 hours, 17 minutes and 22 seconds, and they were the first foreign skippers to win the French award.

===America&#x27;s Cup===
Brought in at the last minute by Carl McKenzie to manage New Zealand&#x27;s 1992 America&#x27;s Cup challenge, Blake led the Kiwi team to the challenger finals with NZL-20. However, Italy emerged from the controversial series with the Louis Vuitton Cup, and went on to face America³ in the America&#x27;s Cup match.

Blake was back for the 1995 America&#x27;s Cup challenge, this time as the syndicate head of Team New Zealand. With NZL 32, &quot;Black Magic&quot;, the team made a clean sweep, beating Dennis Conner 5–0. Blake&#x27;s &quot;lucky red socks&quot; (a present from his wife) became something of a trademark. It was commonplace to see New Zealanders wear red socks or fly them from car aerials during the Cup races and a highly successful &quot;fundraising edition&quot; of official red socks emblazoned with the sail numbers of the two NZL yachts was produced to help fund the syndicate. Subsequently, following his murder, red socks became a badge of mourning to his many admirers.

In the 2000 America&#x27;s Cup, Team New Zealand, still led by Blake, became the first non-American team to successfully defend the America&#x27;s Cup, beating Prada 5–0. Following this defence, Blake stood down from the team.

Blake was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Post racing==
In 1997, Blake became the Cousteau Society&#x27;s head of expeditions, and skipper of the &quot;Antarctic Explorer&quot;, which he later purchased from the Society and renamed &quot;Seamaster&quot;. After leaving the Society he led expeditions to Antarctica and the Amazon aboard &quot;Seamaster&quot; during 2001. The same year Blake was named Special Envoy for the UN Environment Programme. He began filming documentaries for &#x27;blakexpeditions&#x27;, a company he founded.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1983 New Year Honours, Blake was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), for services to ocean yacht racing. In the 1991 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for services to yachting, and he was further promoted to Knight Commander of the same Order (KBE) in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Blake received an honorary doctorate in 1999 from Massey University, and another in 2000 from Auckland University of Technology.

==Death and legacy==
On 5 December 2001, pirates shot and killed Blake while he was on an environmental exploration trip in South America, monitoring global warming and pollution for the United Nations. The two-month expedition was anchored off Macapá, Brazil, at the mouth of the Amazon delta, waiting to clear customs after a trip up the Amazon river. At around 9 p.m. a group of six to eight armed, masked robbers wearing balaclavas and crash helmets boarded the &quot;Seamaster&quot;. As one of the robbers held a gun to the head of a crewmember, Blake sprang from the cabin wielding a rifle. He shot one of the assailants in the hand before the rifle malfunctioned; he was then fatally shot in the back by assailant Ricardo Colares Tavares. The boarders injured two other crew members with knives, and the remaining seven were unhurt.

The only thing seized by the attackers was a 15 hp outboard motor and some watches from the crew. Authorities eventually captured the pirates and sentenced them to an average of 32 years in prison each; Tavares, the man who fired the fatal shots, received a sentence of 36 years. Prior to the attack, the yacht&#x27;s crew had been very careful when travelling up the river and back down again; they always had crew members on watch. Only upon return to Macapa did they relax their guard.

Blake is survived by his wife Pippa, Lady Blake, and their two children Sarah-Jane and James. Blake&#x27;s sister&#x27;s daughter Anna Burnet is also a sailor and an Olympic Silver medallist. Blake&#x27;s environmental and leadership legacy is continued by The Sir Peter Blake Trust, a non-profit organisation based in New Zealand.

Around 30,000 people attended a memorial service held for Blake at the Auckland Domain on 23 December 2001, and included tributes from Blake&#x27;s family, the New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, the Brazilian Ambassador, and Neil and Tim Finn. Helen Clark spent a night aboard the &quot;Seamaster&quot; three weeks prior to the attack. She called Blake a &quot;living legend&quot; and a &quot;national hero&quot;. In her eulogy she said in part: &quot;Our small nation went into shock. Peter Blake was a living legend. As an outstanding sailor, he had brought great honour and fame to New Zealand. His death was unthinkable.&quot;

Blake is buried at Warblington Cemetery, located opposite St Thomas a Becket Church near Emsworth on the south coast of England. Emsworth is where Pippa and Peter settled and raised their two children. His headstone bears the words of John Masefield&#x27;s famous poem, &quot;Sea-Fever&quot;: &quot;I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, / And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by...&quot;.

In October 2002, the International Olympic Committee posthumously awarded the Olympic Order, one of its highest honours, to Blake. In December 2003, the Sir Peter Blake Trust was established, with the support of the Blake family, &quot;to help New Zealanders make a positive difference for the planet through activities that encourage environmental awareness and action, and leadership development.&quot;

The Trust has a range of initiatives, including the annual Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards. These awards consist of the Blake Medal, awarded each year to an outstanding New Zealand leader, and the Sir Peter Blake Emerging Leader Awards, presented annually to six people recognised as younger leaders of considerable potential. The winners of the Blake Medal, in order starting 2005, are John Anderson, Stephen Tindall, Paul Callaghan, Murray Halberg, John Hood (university administrator), Ray Avery, Margaret Bazley, John Graham, Mick Brown, Peter Jackson, Rob Fenwick, Peter Gluckman, Mason Durie and Tariana Turia.

&quot;Seamaster&quot; was originally built in France. After Blake&#x27;s death she was eventually purchased by Étienne Bourgois and renamed &quot;Tara&quot; expedition. She continues to undertake successful expeditions.

In 2002, the Sir Peter Blake Marine Education and Recreation Centre was named in honour of Blake.

The Sir Peter Blake Regatta is held annually in celebration of Blake&#x27;s life. It is the largest youth centreboard regatta in the southern hemisphere.

Blake Massif is named after Blake.

<doc id="213362" wikidata="Q55431" url="?curid=213362" title="Wong Kar-wai">
<text>Wong Kar-wai (born 17 July 1958) is a Hong Kong film director, screenwriter, and producer. His films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong is considered a contemporary auteur, and ranks third on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s 2002 poll of the greatest filmmakers of the previous 25 years. His films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally.

Born in Shanghai, Wong emigrated to Hong Kong as a child with his family. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (1988). While &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990), his first venture in such a direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; (1994), met with a mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the genre.

Exhausted by the time-consuming filming and post-production of &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, Wong directed &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), a smaller film that he hoped would rekindle his love of cinema during a two-month sabbatical while waiting for post-production equipment to arrive for &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong followed up with the crime thriller &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; in 1995. Although it was initially tepidly received by critics, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; has since come to be considered a cult classic of the Golden Age of Hong Kong cinema, being especially representative of Wong&#x27;s style. Wong would go on to consolidate his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama &quot;Happy Together&quot;, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival.

The 2000 drama &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong&#x27;s trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are &quot;2046&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.

==Early life==

Wong Kar-wai was born on 17 July 1958 in Shanghai, the youngest of three siblings. His father was a sailor and his mother was a housewife. By the time Wong was five years old, the seeds of the Cultural Revolution were beginning to take effect in China and his parents decided to relocate to Hong Kong. The two older children were meant to join them later, but the borders closed before they had a chance and Wong did not see his brother or sister again for ten years. In Hong Kong, the family settled in Tsim Sha Tsui, and his father got work managing a night club. Being an only child in a new city, Wong has said he felt isolated during his childhood; he struggled to learn Cantonese and English, only becoming fluent in these new languages when he was a teenager.

As a youth, Wong was frequently taken to the cinema by his mother and exposed to a variety of films. He later said: &quot;The only hobby I had as a child was watching movies&quot;. At school he was studying graphic design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic in 1980, but later dropped out of college after being accepted to a training course with the TVB television network, where he learned the processes of media production.

==Career==
===Beginnings (1980–1989)===
He soon began a screenwriting career, firstly at a Hong Kong local TV series and soap operas, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1981), before progressing to film scripts. He worked as part of a team, contributing to a variety of genres including romance, comedy, thriller, and crime. Wong had little enthusiasm for these early projects, described by the film scholar Gary Bettinson as &quot;occasionally diverting and mostly disposable&quot;, but continued to write throughout the 1980s on films including &quot;Just for Fun&quot; (1983), &quot;Rosa&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Haunted Cop Shop of Horrors&quot; (1987). He is credited with ten screenplays between 1982 and 1987, but claims to have worked on about fifty more without official credit. Wong spent two years writing the screenplay for Patrick Tam&#x27;s action film &quot;Final Victory&quot; (1987), for which he was nominated at the 7th Hong Kong Film Awards.
By 1987 the Hong Kong film industry was at a peak, enjoying a considerable level of prosperity and productivity. New directors were needed to maintain this success, and – through his links in the industry – Wong was invited to become a partner on a new independent company, In-Gear, and given the opportunity to direct his own picture. Gangster films were popular at the time, in the wake of John Woo&#x27;s highly-successful &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), and Wong decided to follow suit. Specifically, unlike Hong Kong&#x27;s other crime films, he chose to focus on young gangsters. The film, named &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, tells the story of a conflicted youth who has to watch over his hot-headed friend.

Because he was well acquainted with the producer, Alan Tang, Wong was given considerable freedom in the making of &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;. His cast included what he considered some of &quot;the hottest young idols in Hong Kong&quot;: singer Andy Lau, Maggie Cheung, and Jacky Cheung. &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; was released in June 1988 and was popular with audiences. Several journalists named Wong among the &quot;Hong Kong New Wave&quot;. While it was a conventional crime film, critic David Bordwell said that Wong &quot;[stood] out from his peers by abandoning the kinetics of comedies and action movies in favour of more liquid atmospherics.&quot; &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; received no attention from Western critics upon its initial release, but it was selected to be screened during the Directors&#x27; Fortnight of the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

===Developing style (1990–1994)===
For his next film, Wong decided to move away from the crime trend in Hong Kong cinema, to which he felt indifferent. He was eager to make something unique, and the financial success of &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; made this possible. Developing a more personal project than his previous film, Wong picked the 1960s as a setting – evoking an era that he remembered well and had a &quot;special feeling&quot; for. &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; focuses on a disillusioned young adult named Yuddy and those around him. There is no straightforward plot or obvious genre, but Stephen Teo sees it as a film about the &quot;longing for love&quot;. Andy Lau, Maggie Cheung, and Jacky Cheung rejoined Wong for his second film, while Leslie Cheung was cast in the central role. Hired as cinematographer was Christopher Doyle, who became one of Wong&#x27;s most important collaborators, photographing his next six films.

With its popular stars, &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; was expected to be a mainstream picture; instead it was a character piece, more concerned with mood and atmosphere than narrative. Released in December 1990, the film earned little at the box office and divided critics. Despite this, it won five Hong Kong Film Awards, and received some attention internationally. With its experimental narrative, expressive camerawork, and themes of lost time and love, &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; is described by film critic Peter Brunette as the first typical &quot;Wong Kar-wai film&quot;. It has since gained a reputation as one of Hong Kong&#x27;s finest releases. Its initial failure was disheartening for the director, and he could not gain funding for his next project – a planned sequel.

Struggling to get support for his work, Wong formed his own production company, Jet Tone Films, with Jeff Lau in 1992. In need of further backing, Wong accepted a studio&#x27;s offer that he make a  (ancient martial arts) film based on the popular novel &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; by Jin Yong. Wong was enthusiastic about the idea, claiming he had long wanted to make a costume drama. He eventually took little from the book other than three characters, and in 1992 began experimenting with several different narrative structures to weave what he called &quot;a very complex tapestry&quot;. Filming began with another all-star cast: Leslie, Maggie, and Jacky Cheung returned alongside Brigitte Lin, Carina Lau, Charlie Young, and Tony Leung Chiu-wai − the latter of which became one of Wong&#x27;s key collaborators.

Set during the Song dynasty, &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; concerns a desert-exiled assassin who is called upon by several different characters while nursing a broken heart. It was a difficult production and the project was not completed for two years, at a cost of HK$47 million. Upon release in September 1994, audiences were confused by the film&#x27;s vague plotting and atypical take on . The film scholar Martha P. Nochimson has called it &quot;the most unusual martial arts film ever made&quot;, as fast-paced action scenes are replaced with character ruminations, and story becomes secondary to the use of colour, landscape, and imagery. As such, &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; was a commercial failure, but critics were generally appreciative of Wong&#x27;s &quot;refusal to be loyal to [the ] genre&quot;. The film won several local awards, and competed at the Venice Film Festival where Doyle won Best Cinematography. In 2008, Wong reworked the film and re-released it as &quot;Ashes of Time Redux&quot;.

===Breakthrough (1994–1995)===

During the long production of &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, Wong faced a two-month break as he waited for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: &quot;I thought I should do something to make myself feel comfortable about making films again. So I made &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, which I made like a student film.&quot; Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;.

&quot;Chungking Express&quot; is split into two distinct parts – both set in contemporary Hong Kong and focusing on lonely policemen (Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung Chiu-wai) who each fall for a woman (Brigitte Lin and Faye Wong). Wong was keen to experiment with &quot;two crisscrossing stories in one movie&quot; and worked spontaneously, filming at night what he had written that day. Peter Brunette notes that &quot;Chungking&quot; is considerably more fun and lighthearted than the director&#x27;s previous efforts, but deals with the same themes. At the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards it was named Best Picture, and Wong received Best Director. Miramax acquired the film for American distribution, which, according to Brunette, &quot;catapulted Wong to international attention&quot;. Stephen Schneider includes it in his book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot; with the summary: &quot;While other films by Wong may pack more emotional resonance, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; gets off on sheer innocence, exuberance, and cinematic freedom, a striking triumph of style over substance&quot;.
Wong continued to work without break, expanding his ideas from &quot;Chungking Express&quot; into another film about alienated young adults in contemporary Hong Kong. &quot;Chungking Express&quot; had originally been conceived as three stories; one of them was later included in his later film, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, but with new characters. Wong conceived both films as complementary studies of Hong Kong: &quot;To me &quot;Chungking Express&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; are one film that should be three hours long.&quot;

&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; is broadly considered a crime thriller, and contains scenes of extreme violence, but is atypical of the genre and heavily infused with Wong&#x27;s fragmented, experimental style. The loose plot again involves two distinct, subtly overlapping narratives, and is dominated by frantic visuals. The film mostly occurs at night and explores the dark side of Hong Kong, which Wong planned intentionally to balance the sweetness of &quot;Chungking&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s fair to show both sides of a coin&quot;. Takeshi Kaneshiro and Charlie Young were cast again, but new to Wong&#x27;s films were Leon Lai, Michelle Reis and Karen Mok. Upon release in September 1995, several critics felt that the film was too similar to &quot;Chungking Express&quot; and some complained that Wong had become self-indulgent. However, as time went on, critics would go on to have a significant re-appraisal of the film, and it has amassed a large cult following, becoming one of Wong&#x27;s most popular and iconic films. &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; has often been stated as one of the director&#x27;s most stylish films, and it has also been received with praise for its non-conventional, fragmented plot. Film historians Zhang Yingjin and Xiao Zhiwei commented: &quot;While not as groundbreaking as its predecessors, the film is still different and innovative enough to confirm [Wong&#x27;s] presence on the international scene.&quot;

===Widespread recognition (1996–2000)===

While his reputation grew steadily throughout the early 1990s, Wong&#x27;s international standing was &quot;thoroughly consolidated&quot; with the 1997 romantic drama &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997). Its development was influenced by the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China, which occurred that year. Wong was widely expected to address the event in his next film; instead, he avoided the pressure by choosing to shoot in Argentina. The issues of the handover were nevertheless important: knowing that homosexuals in Hong Kong faced uncertainty after 1997, Wong decided to focus on a relationship between two men. He was keen to present the relationship as ordinary and universal, as he felt Hong Kong&#x27;s previous LGBT films had not.

&quot;Happy Together&quot; tells the story of a couple (Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Leslie Cheung) who travel to Buenos Aires in an effort to save their relationship. Wong decided to change the structure and style from his previous films, as he felt he had become predictable. Teo, Brunette, and Jeremy Tambling all see &quot;Happy Together&quot; as a marked change from his earlier work: the story is more linear and understandable, there are only three characters (with no women at all), and while it still has Doyle&#x27;s &quot;exuberant&quot; photography, it is more stylistically restrained. After a difficult production period – where a six-week shoot was dragged out to four months – the film was released in May 1997 to great critical acclaim. It competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where Wong became Hong Kong&#x27;s first winner of the Best Director Award (an achievement he downplayed: &quot;it makes no difference, it&#x27;s just something you can put on an ad.&quot;)
In his 2005 monograph, Brunette opines that &quot;Happy Together&quot; marked &quot;a new stage in [Wong&#x27;s] artistic development&quot;, and along with its successor – &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000) – showcases the director at &quot;the zenith of his cinematic art.&quot; The latter film emerged from a highly complicated production history that lasted two years. Several different titles and projects were planned by Wong before they evolved into the final result: a romantic melodrama set in 1960s Hong Kong that is seen as an unofficial sequel to &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;. Wong decided to return to the era that fascinated him, and reflected his own background by focusing on Shanghainese émigrés.

Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai play the lead characters, who move into an apartment building on the same day in 1962 and discover that their spouses are having an affair; over the next four years they develop a strong attraction. Teo writes that the film is a study of &quot;typical Chinese reserve and repressed desire&quot;, while Schneider describes how the &quot;strange relationship&quot; is choreographed with &quot;the grace and rhythm of a waltz&quot; and depicted in &quot;a dreamlike haze by an eavesdropping camera&quot;.

The shoot lasted 15 months, with both Cheung and Leung reportedly driven to their breaking points. Wong shot more than 30 times the footage he eventually used, and only finished editing the film the morning before its Cannes premiere. At the festival, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; received the Technical Grand Prize and Best Actor for Leung. It was named Best Foreign Film by the National Society of Film Critics. Wong said after its release: &quot;&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is the most difficult film in my career so far, and one of the most important. I am very proud of it.&quot; In subsequent years it has been included on lists of the greatest films of all time.

===International work (2001–2007)===
While &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; took two years to complete, its sequel – &quot;2046&quot; – took double that time. The film was actually conceived first, when Wong picked the title as a reference to the final year of China&#x27;s &quot;One country, two systems&quot; promise to Hong Kong. Although his plans changed and a new film developed, he simultaneously shot material for &quot;2046&quot;, with the first footage dating back to December 1999. Wong immediately continued with the project once &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; was complete, reportedly becoming obsessed with it. In Bettinson&#x27;s account, it &quot;became a behemoth, impossible to finish&quot;.

&quot;2046&quot; continues the story of Chow Mo-wan, Leung&#x27;s character from &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, though he is considered much colder and very different. Wong found that he did not want to leave the character, and commenced where he left off in 1966; nevertheless, he claimed: &quot;It&#x27;s another story, about how a man faces his future due to a certain past&quot;. His plans were vague and according to Teo, he set &quot;a new record in his own method of free-thinking, time-extensive and improvisatory filmmaking&quot; with the production. Scenes were shot in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Bangkok. Actresses Zhang Ziyi and Gong Li were cast to play the women who consume Mo-wan, as the character plans a science fiction novel titled &quot;2046&quot;. The film premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, but Wong delivered the print 24 hours late and still was not happy: he continued editing until the film&#x27;s October release. It was Wong&#x27;s most expensive and longest-running project to date. &quot;2046&quot; was a commercial failure in Hong Kong, but the majority of western critics gave it positive reviews. Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised it as an &quot;enigmatic, rapturously beautiful meditation on romance and remembrance&quot;, while Steve Erikson of &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; called it Wong&#x27;s masterpiece.
Before starting on his next feature, Wong worked on the anthology film &quot;Eros&quot; (2004), providing one of three short films (the others directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and Steven Soderbergh) that centre on the theme of lust. Wong&#x27;s segment, titled &quot;The Hand&quot;, starred Gong Li as a 1960s call girl and Chang Chen as her potential client. Although &quot;Eros&quot; was not well received, Wong&#x27;s segment was often called the most successful.

Following the difficult production of &quot;2046&quot;, Wong wanted his next feature to be a simple, invigorating experience. He decided to make an English-language film in America, later justifying this by explaining: &quot;It&#x27;s a new landscape. It&#x27;s a new background, so it&#x27;s refreshing.&quot; After hearing a radio interview with the singer Norah Jones he immediately decided to contact her, and she signed on as the lead. Wong&#x27;s understanding of America was based only on short visits and what he had seen in films, but he was keen to depict the country accurately. As such, he co-wrote the film (one of the rare times a screenplay was pre-prepared) with author Lawrence Block. Titled &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot;, it focused on a young New Yorker who leaves for a road trip when she learns that her boyfriend has been unfaithful. Cast as the figures she meets were Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and David Strathairn.

Filming on &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot; took place over seven weeks in 2006, on location in Manhattan, Memphis, Las Vegas, and Ely, Nevada. Wong produced it in the same manner as he would in Hong Kong, and the themes and visual style – despite Doyle being replaced by cinematographer Darius Khondji – remained the same. Premiering in May 2007, &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot; was Wong&#x27;s fourth consecutive film to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes. Although he considered it a &quot;special experience&quot;, the film did not receive positive critical reviews. With common complaints that the material was thin and the product uneven, &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot; became Wong&#x27;s first critical failure.

===2008–present===
Wong&#x27;s next film was not released for five years, as he underwent another long and difficult production on &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; (2013) – a biographical film of the martial arts teacher Ip Man. The idea had occurred to him in 1999, but he did not commit to it until the completion of &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot;. Ip Man is a legendary figure in Hong Kong, known for training actor Bruce Lee in the art of Wing Chun, but Wong decided to focus on an earlier period of Ip&#x27;s life (1936–1956) that covered the turmoil of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. He set out to make &quot;a commercial and colourful film&quot;. After considerable research and preparation, filming began in 2009. Tony Leung Chui-wai rejoined Wong for their seventh film together, having spent 18 months being trained in Wing Chun. The &quot;gruelling&quot; production lasted intermittently for three years, twice interrupted by Leung fracturing his arm, and is Wong&#x27;s most expensive to date.

&quot;The Grandmaster&quot; is described by Bettinson as a mixture of popular and arthouse traditions, with form, visuals, and themes consistent with Wong&#x27;s previous work. Three different versions of the film exist, as Wong shorted it from its domestic release for the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, and again for its US distribution by the Weinstein Company. Described in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; as Wong&#x27;s most accessible film since his debut, &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; won twelve Hong Kong Film Awards, including Best Film and Best Director, and received two Academy Award nominations (Cinematography and Production Design). Critics approved of the film, and with a worldwide gross of US$64 million it is Wong&#x27;s most lucrative film to date.
When asked about his career in 2014, Wong told &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;To be honest with you, I feel I&#x27;m only halfway done.&quot; In November 2016, he was announced as taking over an upcoming film about the murder of Maurizio Gucci from previous director Ridley Scott, but commented in October 2017 that he was no longer involved in the project. In September 2017, Amazon Video issued a straight-to-series order for &quot;Tong Wars&quot;, a television drama to be directed by Wong. It focuses on the gang wars that occurred in nineteenth-century San Francisco, but Amazon later dropped the series. 

In May 2019, Wong announced the 4K restoration of his entire filmography, which was released in 2021 in celebration of the 20th anniversary of &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. The restoration was carried out by the Cineteca di Bologna&#x27;s film restoration laboratory L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata. Criterion Collection released Wong&#x27;s restored filmography as a box set in the United States in March 2021. On December 27, 2023, Wong&#x27;s first TV series &quot;Blossoms Shanghai,&quot; based on Jin Yucheng&#x27;s book of the same name, aired on CCTV-8 and Tencent Video. The series follows a businessman named A Bao (Hu Ge) through the changing times in Shanghai.

==Personal life==

In 1981, Wong met TVB program producer Esther Chen at a bar. At her suggestion, he applied for TVB’s director training program. Wong’s first film script, &quot;Once Upon a Rainbow&quot;, was purchased by director Agnes Ng through Chen’s introduction. Chen also sold his subsequent scripts, &quot;Final Victory&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Haunted Cop Shop&quot;. In 1985, Wong married Chen in Hong Kong, after which she became his producer and production partner. In 1997, Chen gave birth to their son in Hong Kong. In October 2017, while accepting the Lumière Award for lifetime achievement at the Lumière Film Festival in France, Wong referred to his wife as his “muse,” stating: “Of all the great female characters I have created in my films, there are always glimpses of her there. That is the reason why her name is always the first to appear onscreen in all of my films.”

In 2009, Wong signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski following his arrest in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges after being detained while traveling to a film festival, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

==Filmmaking==

===Influences===

Wong is wary of sharing his favourite directors, but has stated that he watched a range of films growing up, from Hong Kong genre films to European art films. They were never labelled as such, and so he approached them equally and was broadly influenced. The energy of the Hong Kong films had a &quot;tremendous&quot; impact according to Brunette. Art professor Giorgio Biancorosso commented that Wong&#x27;s international influences include Martin Scorsese, Michelangelo Antonioni, Alfred Hitchcock, and Bernardo Bertolucci. Some of his favorite contemporary filmmakers include Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino. He is often compared with French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. Wong&#x27;s most direct influence was his colleague Patrick Tam, who was an important mentor and likely inspired his use of colour.

Outside of cinema, Wong has been heavily influenced by literature. He has a particular affinity for Latin American writers, and the fragmentary nature of his films came primarily from the &quot;scrapbook structures&quot; of novels by Manuel Puig, Gabriel García Márquez and Julio Cortázar, which he attempted to emulate. Haruki Murakami, particularly his novel &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, also provided inspiration, as did the writing of Liu Yichang. The television channel MTV was a further influence on Wong. He said in a 1998 interview: &quot;In the late eighties, when [MTV] was first shown in Hong Kong, we were all really impressed with the energy and the fragmented structure. It seemed like we should go in this direction.&quot;

===Method and collaborators===

Wong has an unusual approach to film making, starting production without a script and generally relying on instinct and improvisation rather than pre-prepared ideas. He has said he dislikes writing and finds filming from a finished script &quot;boring&quot;. According to Stokes &amp; Hoover, he writes as he shoots, &quot;drawing inspiration from the music, the setting, working conditions, and actors&quot;. In advance, the cast are given a minimal plot outline and expected to develop their characters as they film. To capture naturalness and spontaneity, Wong does not allow for rehearsals while improvisation and collaboration are encouraged. He similarly does not use storyboards or plan camera placement, preferring to experiment as he goes. His shooting ratio is therefore very high, sometimes forty takes per scene, and production typically goes well over schedule and over budget. Tony Leung has commented that this approach is &quot;taxing on the actors&quot;, but Stokes &amp; Hoover speculate that Wong&#x27;s collaborators endure it because &quot;[the] results are always unexpected, invigorating, and interesting.&quot;

Though Wong admits to being controlling, and oversees every aspect of the film making process, he has formed several long-lasting partnerships and close collaborators. In 2013, he said: &quot;It is always good to work with a very regular group of people because we know how high we can fly and what are the parameters, and it becomes very enjoyable.&quot; Two men have been instrumental in developing and achieving his aesthetic: production designer William Chang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle. Chang has worked on every Wong film and is a trusted confidant, responsible for all set design and costuming. Doyle photographed seven of his projects, all from &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; to &quot;2046&quot;. Stephen Schneider writes that he deserves &quot;much credit&quot; in Wong&#x27;s success, as his &quot;masterful use of light and colour renders every frame a work of art&quot;. Wong&#x27;s other regular colleagues include writer-producer Jeffrey Lau, producer Jacky Pang, and assistant director Johnnie Kong.

Wong often casts the same actors. He is strongly associated with Tony Leung Chiu-wai, who has appeared in seven of Wong&#x27;s feature length films. Wong describes him as a partner, stating, &quot;I feel like there is a lot of things between me and Tony that is beyond words. We don&#x27;t need meetings, talks, whatever, because a lot of things are understood.&quot; Other actors who have appeared in at least three of his films are Maggie Cheung, Chang Chen, Leslie Cheung, Jacky Cheung, and Carina Lau.

===Style===

Wong is known for producing art films focused on mood and atmosphere, rather than following convention. His general style is described by Teo as &quot;a cornucopia overflowing with multiple stories, strands of expression, meanings and identities: a kaleidoscope of colours and identities&quot;. Structurally, Wong&#x27;s films are typically fragmented and disjointed, with little concern for linear narrative, and often with interconnected stories. Critics have commented on the lack of plot in his films, such as Burr who says: &quot;The director doesn&#x27;t build linear story lines so much as concentric rings of narrative and poetic meaning that continually revolve around each other&quot;. Similarly, Brunette says that Wong &quot;often privileges audio/visual expressivity over narrative structure&quot;. Wong has commented on this, saying &quot;in my logic there is a storyline.&quot;

Key to Wong&#x27;s films is the visual style, which is often described as beautiful and unique. The colours are bold and saturated, the camerawork swooning, resulting in what Brunette calls his &quot;signature visual pyrotechnics&quot;. One of his trademarks is the use of step-printing, which alters film rates to &quot;[liquefy] hard blocks of primary colour into iridescent streaks of light.&quot; Other features of the Wong aesthetic include slow motion, off-centre framing, the obscuring of faces, rack focus, filming in the dark or rain, and elliptical editing. Schneider writes of Wong&#x27;s fondness for &quot;playing with film stock, exposure, and speed the way others might fiddle with a script.&quot;

Another trademark of Wong&#x27;s cinema is his use of music and pop songs. He places great importance on this element, and Biancorosso describes it as the &quot;essence&quot; of his films; a key part of the &quot;narrative machinery&quot; that can guide the rhythm of the editing. He selects international songs, rarely cantopop, and uses them to enhance the sense of history or place. According to film scholar Julian Stringer, music &quot;proved crucial to the emotional and cognitive appeal&quot; of Wong&#x27;s films.

Wong&#x27;s dependence on music and his heavily visual and disjointed style has been compared to music videos, but detractors claim that they are &quot;all surface and no depth&quot;. Academic Curtis K. Tsui argues that style &quot;is&quot; the substance in Wong&#x27;s film, while Brunette believes that his &quot;form remains resolutely in the service of character, theme, and emotion rather than indulged in for its own sake&quot;.

==Legacy==

Wong is an important figure in contemporary cinema, regarded as one of the best filmmakers of his generation. His reputation as a maverick began early in his career: in the 1996 &quot;Encyclopedia of Chinese Film&quot;, Wong was described as having &quot;already established a secure reputation as one of the most daring avant-garde filmmakers&quot; of Chinese cinema. Authors Zhang and Xiao concluded that he &quot;occupies a special place in contemporary film history&quot;, and had already &quot;exerted a sizeable impact&quot;. With the subsequent release of &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;, Wong&#x27;s international standing grew further, and in 2002 voters for the British Film Institute named him the third greatest director of the previous quarter-century. In 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; named him an icon of arthouse cinema.

The East Asian scholar Daniel Martin describes Wong&#x27;s output as &quot;among the most internationally accessible and critically acclaimed Hong Kong films of all time&quot;. Because of this status abroad, Wong is seen as a pivotal figure in his local industry; Julian Stringer says he is &quot;central to the contemporary Chinese cinema renaissance&quot;, Gary Bettinson describes him as &quot;a beacon of Hong Kong cinema&quot; who &quot;has kept that industry in the public spotlight&quot;, and Film4 designate him the filmmaker from China with the greatest impact. Together with Zhang Yimou, Wong is seen by the historian Philip Kemp as representing the &quot;internationalisation&quot; of East Asian cinema. Domestically, his films were generally not financial successes, but he has been consistently well-awarded by local bodies. From early on, he was regarded as Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and one of their most iconoclastic filmmakers. Despite this, he has been recognised in both cult and mainstream circles, producing art films that receive commercial exposure. He is known for confounding audiences, as he adopts established genres and subverts them with experimental techniques.

Both Stringer and Nochimson claim that Wong has one of the most distinctive filmmaking styles in the industry. From his first film &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, he made an impact with his &quot;liquid&quot; aesthetic, which Ungerböck claims was completely new and quickly copied in Asian film and television. His second film, &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, is described by Brunette as &quot;a landmark in Hong Kong cinema&quot; for its unconventional approach. Nochimson writes that Wong&#x27;s films are entirely personal, making him an auteur, and states, &quot;Wong has developed his own cinematic vocabulary, with an array of shot patterns connected with him&quot;. Stringer argues that Wong&#x27;s success demonstrates the importance of being &quot;different&quot;.

Wong&#x27;s films frequently appeared on best-of lists domestically and internationally. On the Hong Kong Film Awards Association&#x27;s 2005 list of The Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures, all except one of his films up to that time made the list. &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990) placed at number three, the highest position for a post-1980s film; other films ranked were &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (22), &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; (35), &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (88), &quot;Happy Together&quot; (89), and &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (90). In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, whereby industry professionals submit ballots to determine the greatest films of all time, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; was ranked 24th, the highest-ranked film since 1980 and the sixth greatest film by a living director. &quot;Chungking Express&quot; and &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; both ranked in the top 250; &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;2046&quot; in the top 500; and &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; and &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; also featured (all but two of Wong&#x27;s films at the time).

Wong&#x27;s influence has impacted contemporary directors including Quentin Tarantino, Sofia Coppola, Lee Myung-se, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Tom Tykwer, The Daniels, Zhang Yuan, Tsui Hark, and Barry Jenkins. In 2018, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree by Harvard University.

==Filmography and awards==

Wong&#x27;s oeuvre consists of ten directed features, 16 films where is he credited only as screenwriter, one television series and seven films from other directors that he has produced. He has also directed commercials, short films, and music videos, and contributed to two anthology films. He has received awards and nominations from organisations in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. In 2006, Wong accepted the National Order of the Legion of Honour: Knight (Lowest Degree) from the French Government. In 2013, he was bestowed with the title of a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the highest order, by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. The International Film Festival of India gave Wong a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.

<text>Charles Rivington (1688 – 22 February 1742) was a British publisher.

==Life==
The eldest son of Thurston Rivington, Rivington was born at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in 1688. Coming to London as apprentice to a bookseller, Matthews, he took over in 1711 the publishing business of Richard Chiswell (1639–1711), and, at the sign of the Bible and the Crown in Paternoster Row, he carried on a business almost entirely connected with theological and educational literature. He published one of George Whitefield&#x27;s earliest works, &#x27;The Nature and Necessity of a new Birth in Christ&#x27; (1737) and brought out an edition of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;. George Whitefield at that time was acknowledged as the leader of Methodism and he was preaching to thousands. He recounts how he was approached by Charles Rivington and had to be persuaded that this was the correct course. Rivington published &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot; in 1724, containing vivid biographies of contemporary English and Welsh pirates.
In 1736 Rivington with Bettesworth founded the company of booksellers who called themselves the &quot;New Conger,&quot; in rivalry with the older association, the &quot;Conger,&quot; dating from about 1700. In 1741 he published the first volume of Samuel Richardson&#x27;s novel, Pamela.

After his death, Charles Rivington was succeeded by his two sons, John (1720–1792) and James (1724–1802). James emigrated to America, and pursued his trade in New York City; John carried on the business of Rivington and Co. on the lines marked out by his father, and was the great Church of England publisher of the day.

A descendant, Luke Rivington (1838-1899), became an English Roman Catholic priest and prolific Christian writer.

<text>Semi-Detached is the fourth major label album by the rock band Therapy? Released on 30 March 1998 on A&amp;M Records, it turned out to be their final album on the label. The album was recorded at various stages throughout 1997, including sessions at Chipping Norton Studios in Oxford, Homestead Studio in Randalstown, Moles Studio in Bath and Metropolis Studios in London. It was also the first Therapy? album recorded with Graham Hopkins and Martin McCarrick as full-time members. The album was not released in USA, but charted at number 21 in the UK Albums Chart.

The album was originally released on CD and Cassette, and as a limited edition box set of six 7&quot; singles.

A remastered CD version of the album by Harvey Birrell was included in &quot;The Gemil Box&quot;, released on 18 November 2013.

<text>Evolutionary art is a branch of generative art, in which the artist does not do the work of constructing the artwork, but rather lets a system do the construction. In evolutionary art, initially generated art is put through an iterated process of selection and modification to arrive at a final product, where it is the artist who is the selective agent.

Evolutionary art is to be distinguished from BioArt, which uses living organisms as the material medium instead of paint, stone, metal, etc.

==Overview==
In common with biological evolution through natural selection or animal husbandry, the members of a population undergoing artificial evolution modify their form or behavior over many reproductive generations in response to a selective regime.

In interactive evolution the selective regime may be applied by the viewer explicitly by selecting individuals which are aesthetically pleasing. Alternatively a selection pressure can be generated implicitly, for example according to the length of time a viewer spends near a piece of evolving art.

Equally, evolution may be employed as a mechanism for generating a dynamic world of adaptive individuals, in which the selection pressure is imposed by the program, and the viewer plays no role in selection, as in the Black Shoals project.

<doc id="213373" wikidata="Q333673" url="?curid=213373" title="William Waller">
<text>Sir William Waller JP (c. 159819 September 1668) was an English soldier and politician, who commanded Parliamentarian armies during the First English Civil War. Elected MP for Andover to the Long Parliament in 1640, Waller relinquished his military positions under the Self-denying Ordinance in 1645. Although deeply religious and a devout Puritan, he belonged to the moderate Presbyterian faction, who opposed the involvement of the New Model Army in politics post 1646. As a result, he was one of the Eleven Members excluded by the army in July 1647, then again by Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648 for refusing to support the Trial of Charles I, and his subsequent execution in January 1649. 

Arrested several times during the British Interregnum, in the run-up to the Stuart Restoration in 1660, he was elected to the Convention Parliament. He retired from politics when it was dissolved, and died at his home in Osterley Park in September 1668. Waller was one of many who served in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms with great reluctance, but did so based on deeply held religious or political principles. He is perhaps best remembered by a letter written in 1643 to his close friend and Royalist opponent, Sir Ralph Hopton.

==Personal details==
William Waller was born in Knole, near Sevenoaks in Kent, son of Sir Thomas Waller and his wife Margaret Lennard, the daughter of Margaret Fiennes, 11th Baroness Dacre. He attended Magdalen Hall, Oxford, then a well-known centre of Puritan education, but did not graduate. Both his father and grandfather served in Parliament, while his first cousin was Sir Hardress Waller.

He married three times; Jane Reynell (1622–1633), Lady Anne Finch (1638–1652), and Lady Anne Harcourt (1652–1661). In all, he had three sons and three daughters, only two of whom survived to adulthood; Margaret (1633–1694) and William (1639–1699).

==Military career in Europe==
The Waller family held various offices in the 16th century, including constable of Dover Castle and MP for Dover, but lost most of their money in the 1590s. William&#x27;s father Thomas served in Ireland and in 1601 purchased the family estates at Groombridge from his uncle George Waller.

Waller followed his father by becoming a professional soldier and in 1617, he joined the army of the Venetian Republic, where he met the English mercenary leader, Sir Horace Vere. In 1620, he and Sir Ralph Hopton were members of the personal bodyguard for Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, sister of the future Charles I. After her husband Frederick was defeated at White Mountain in November, they escorted her to safety in Frankfurt.

On his return to England in 1622, he was rewarded with a knighthood, while he inherited the right to wine import duties from his grandmother, which brought him the then substantial sum of £1,000£3,000 per year. This allowed him to marry Jane Reynell, from a wealthy Devon family; she died in 1633, followed by her father in 1634, then their son Richard in 1636. Waller inherited most of her estates, and he purchased a quarter-share in the Providence Island Company. A devout Presbyterian, this directly connected to others who shared his beliefs, and later became prominent supporters of Parliament, among them John Pym, Henry Darley, Lord Saye, and Lord Brooke.

His second wife, Lady Anne Finch, was related to another influential Kent politician, the Earl of Winchilsea, and shared his religious beliefs. They purchased Winchester Castle in 1638, and lived a &#x27;retired life&#x27; in the country, but as the political conflict between Charles and Parliament increased, Waller felt it his duty to participate. In April 1640, he was elected to the Short Parliament as Member of Parliament for Andover, then re-elected to the Long Parliament on 3 May 1642.

==Wars of the Three Kingdoms==

A firm supporter of Parliament, when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Waller was appointed a colonel, capturing Portsmouth, Farnham, Winchester and other key locations in southern England. In early 1643, Waller was promoted Major-general and given command of the Western Association army, his opponent being Sir Ralph Hopton, an old friend leading Royalist forces in the west.

After the inconclusive Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July, Hopton was joined by Prince Maurice and on 13 July, their combined force destroyed Waller&#x27;s army at Roundway Down. Waller and around 500 cavalry escaped to Bristol, much of whose garrison had been lost at Roundway Down; not wishing to be trapped in the city, on 21 July he and his remaining troops made their way to Evesham. Four days later, Bristol surrendered to Prince Rupert, leaving Parliamentarian forces in the west confined to isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere.

Although defeat had little impact on Waller&#x27;s military reputation, there were increasing signs on all sides of war weariness, including anti-war demonstrations on 7 to 9 August in London. At a strategy meeting in Oxford, the Royalist high command agreed Prince Rupert would capture Gloucester, the last major Parliamentary position in the west, then move against London. This would be supported by Hopton advancing into Hampshire and Sussex, whose iron foundries were Parliament&#x27;s main source of armaments.

Waller assembled a new army at Farnham Castle, consisting of Trained Bands from the South-Eastern Association of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, bolstered by others from London. Throughout the war, both sides relied on these militia; service was normally limited to 30 days, within their home area, but as the largest and best equipped, London units were often used by Parliament to fill gaps. Waller&#x27;s army included several regiments mustered to repel Prince Rupert&#x27;s advance on London, which ended at Newbury in late September. An attack on Basing House in November failed, with many shouting &#x27;Home! Home!&#x27;

Under instructions from the Earl of Essex to retake Alton, then Arundel, Waller persuaded the London Bands to help him capture Alton on 13 December. When he asked for their help with Arundel, they refused, and were sent home on 15 December. However, he successfully captured Arundel on 6 January, before a heavy snow fall ended operations for the next few weeks. By the end of February, Waller&#x27;s army had been increased to 5,000 infantry and 3,500 horse; he was ordered to slip past Hopton and retake the west. Despite the defection of Sir Richard Grenville in early March, who shared this information with Hopton, Waller defeated him at Cheriton on 29 March 1644, ending the Royalist threat in the south-east.
Waller now joined Essex to attack Oxford; to avoid being trapped there, Charles and the main Royalist field army retreated to Worcester; Essex ordered Waller to follow him, while he went west to relieve the siege of Lyme Regis. On 29 June, Waller clashed with Charles at Cropredy Bridge; his losses were minimal, but his men were demoralised. His army disintegrated, causing panic in London, and allowing Charles to pursue Essex into the West Country. 

Essex was defeated at Lostwithiel in September and although he escaped with the cavalry, 5,000 infantry were forced to surrender. At Second Newbury on 27 October, the Royalists lifted the siege of Donnington Castle; lack of co-ordination among the Parliamentary forces under Waller, Essex and Manchester allowed Charles to re-enter Oxford.

Parliament was split between those who wanted an immediate, negotiated settlement and those for whom military victory was the only way to secure their objectives. They also objected to the Scottish alliance, especially the demand for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; Oliver Cromwell claimed he would fight, rather than accept such terms. This conflict became public in recriminations over the failure to exploit Marston Moor, Essex&#x27; capitulation at Lostwithiel, and Manchester&#x27;s alleged unwillingness to fight at Second Newbury; Waller supported these criticisms. In December, Sir Henry Vane introduced the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring any officers in the army or navy who were also members of Parliament to resign from one, or the other. This automatically removed Manchester and Essex, since they could not resign their titles, although later amended to allow them to be re-appointed, &#x27;if Parliament approved.&#x27; Waller supported the Ordinance, and resigned his commission in April 1645.

==Later life and death==

Considered for command in Ireland, Waller also briefly explored returning to Venetian service, but this ended his active military career. Although he backed the creation of the New Model Army, like other Presbyterians, he came to see it as a threat, and supported attempts to disband it when the war ended in 1646. In June 1647, he was one of the Eleven members accused by Cromwell and other Independents of &#x27;plotting to destabilise the kingdom&#x27;, and fled abroad in August.

He stayed in The Hague, where he renewed his acquaintance with Elizabeth of Bohemia, before returning home in June 1648. He was arrested in 1650, allegedly for conspiring to restore Charles II, then released in early 1652. He purchased Osterley Park in 1654, and while frequently questioned under the Protectorate, avoided implication in the 1655 Penruddock uprising.

At the 1660 Restoration, he was elected for Middlesex to the Convention Parliament, but subsequently retired from political life. He spent some of his time writing &quot;A Vindication of the Character and Conduct of Sir William Waller&quot;, which was not published until 1793.

He died on 19 September 1668, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

<text>Longman, also known as Pearson Longman, is a publishing company founded in 1724 in London, England, which is owned by Pearson PLC.

Since 1968, Longman has been used primarily as an imprint by Pearson&#x27;s Schools business. The Longman brand is also used for the Longman Schools in China and the &quot;Longman Dictionary&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The Longman company was founded by Thomas Longman (1699 – 18 June 1755), the son of Ezekiel Longman (died 1708), a gentleman of Bristol. Thomas was apprenticed in 1716 to John Osborn, a London bookseller, and at the expiration of his apprenticeship married Osborn&#x27;s daughter. In August 1724, he purchased the stock and household goods of William Taylor, the first publisher of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, for  9s 6d. Taylor&#x27;s two shops in Paternoster Row, London, were known respectively as the &quot;Black Swan&quot; and the &quot;Ship&quot;, premises at that time having signs rather than numbers, and became the publishing house premises.

Longman entered into partnership with his father-in-law, Osborn, who held one-sixth of the shares in Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; (1728). Longman himself was one of the six booksellers, who undertook the responsibility of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; (1746–1755).

===Second and third generations===
In 1754, Longman took into partnership his nephew, Thomas Longman (1730–1797), and the title of the firm became T. and T. Longman. Upon the death of his uncle in 1755, Longman became sole proprietor. He greatly extended the colonial trade of the firm. In 1794, he took Owen Rees as a partner; in the same year, Thomas Brown (c. 1777–1869) entered the house as an apprentice.

Longman had three sons. Of these, Thomas Norton Longman (1771–1842) succeeded to the business. In 1804, two more partners, including Edward Orme &amp; Thomas Hurst, were admitted, and the former apprentice Brown became a partner in 1811; in 1824, the title of the firm was changed to &#x27;Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown &amp; Green&#x27;. A document of 1823 &quot;Grant of Land in the Concan&quot; printed by the firm under this name shows the name change was from 1823 or earlier.

In 1799, Longman purchased the copyright of Lindley Murray&#x27;s &quot;English Grammar&quot;, which had an annual sale of about copies. In the following year, Richmal Mangnall&#x27;s &quot;Historical and Miscellaneous Questions for the Use of Young People&quot; was purchased, and went through 84 editions by 1857. About 1800 he also purchased the copyright of Southey&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, from Joseph Cottle of Bristol. He published the works of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey and Scott, and acted as London agent for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, which was started in 1802. In 1802 appeared the first part of &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;, edited by Abraham Rees. This was completed in 39 volumes plus 6 volumes of plates in 1819.

In 1814 arrangements were made with Thomas Moore for the publication of &quot;Laila Rookh&quot;, for which he was paid ; and when Archibald Constable failed in 1826, Longmans became the proprietors of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. They issued in 1829 Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Encyclopaedia&quot;, and in 1832 McCulloch&#x27;s &quot;Commercial Dictionary&quot;.

===Fourth and fifth generations===
Thomas Norton Longman died on 29 August 1842, leaving his two sons, Thomas (1804–1879) and William (1813–1877), in control of the business in Paternoster Row. Their first success was the publication of Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot;, which was followed in 1841 by the issue of the first two volumes of his &quot;History of England&quot;, which after a few years had a sale of copies.

The two brothers were well known for their literary talent. Thomas Longman edited a beautifully illustrated edition of the New Testament, and William Longman was the author of several important books, among them a &quot;History of the Three Cathedrals dedicated to St Paul&quot; (1869) and a work on the &quot;History of the Life and Times of Edward III&quot; (1873). In 1863, the firm took over the business of John William Parker, and with it &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and the publication of the works of John Stuart Mill and James Anthony Froude; while in 1890 they incorporated with their own all the publications of the old firm of Rivington, established in 1711. The family control of the firm (later &#x27;Longmans, Green &amp; Co.&#x27;) was continued by Thomas Norton Longman, son of Thomas Longman. In 1884 the firm employed John William Allen as an educationalist. Allen grew the firm&#x27;s educational list, including textbooks he wrote himself. He later inherited the shares of W. E. Green and became a shareholder in 1918.

==1900 onwards==
In December 1940, Longman&#x27;s Paternoster Row offices were destroyed in The Blitz, along with most of the company&#x27;s stock. The company survived this crisis, however, and became a public company in 1948. Longman was acquired by the global publisher Pearson, owner of Penguin and &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, in 1968. Longman&#x27;s medical lists was merged with other Pearson subsidiaries to form Churchill Livingstone in 1972. Also in 1972, Mark Longman, last of the Longman family to run the company, died.

Longman continued to exist as an imprint of Pearson, under the name &#x27;Pearson Longman&#x27;. Pearson Longman specialized in English, including English as a second or foreign language, history, economics, philosophy, political science, and religion.

Longman is now primarily used by Pearson&#x27;s ELT business (English Language Teaching). The Longman brand is now only used for the Longman Schools in China and oddments such as the &quot;Longman Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s Revised Latin Primer&quot;. All other textbooks and products use the Pearson brand/imprint.

<doc id="213379" wikidata="Q4921842" url="?curid=213379" title="Black Shoals">
<text>Black Shoals is an artificial ecosystem linked to the real time dynamics of the stock market. It was first shown at the Tate Gallery in 2001, and nominated for an Alternative Turner Prize in 2002. A more sophisticated Black Shoals was exhibited at the Nikolaj gallery in Copenhagen in the spring of 2004.

Stars representing companies and creatures representing speculators are projected into a domed ceiling in a dark room, creating an artificial night sky which visualises the dynamics of the world stock markets. 

Within this world, a creature&#x27;s survival depends upon the strategies it uses to explore its world. The more a company is traded, the richer the food source for the creatures. Consequently, changes in trading patterns can be seen in the planetarium as explosions of life surrounding specific clusters of stars. 

For this project, Cefn Hoile designed a population of articulated creatures which reproduce and evolve both their morphology and behaviour in real time in a planetarium style display. The project was conceived by Lise Autogena and Joshua Portway of Stain. Tom Riley was the lead software developer during the second showing of Black Shoals in 2004.

The name of the project is a pun on Black–Scholes, a widely used equation in financial derivatives pricing which earned two of its three inventors a Nobel Prize in Economics and provided the key assumptions underlying the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

<text>Left-hand traffic (LHT) and right-hand traffic (RHT) are the practices, in bidirectional traffic, of keeping to the left side or to the right side of the road, respectively. They are fundamental to traffic flow, and are sometimes called the &quot;rule of the road&quot;. The terms right- and left-hand &quot;drive&quot; refer to the position of the driver and the steering wheel in the vehicle and are, in automobiles, the reverse of the terms right- and left-hand &quot;traffic&quot;. The rule also includes where on the road a vehicle is to be driven, if there is room for more than one vehicle in one direction, and the side on which the vehicle in the rear overtakes the one in the front. For example, a driver in an LHT country would typically overtake on the right of the vehicle being overtaken.

RHT is used in 165 countries and territories, mainly in the Americas, Continental Europe, most of Africa and mainland Asia (except South Asia and Thailand), while 75 countries use LHT, which account for about a sixth of the world&#x27;s land area, a quarter of its roads, and about a third of its population. In 1919, 104 of the world&#x27;s territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT. Between 1919 and 1986, 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT.

While many of the countries using LHT were part of the British Empire, others such as Indonesia, Japan, Nepal, Bhutan, Macao, Thailand, Mozambique and Suriname were not. Sweden and Iceland, which have used RHT since September 1967 and late May 1968 respectively, previously used LHT. Most of the countries that were part of the French colonial empire adopted RHT.

Historical switches of traffic handedness have often been motivated by factors such as changes in political administration, a desire for uniformity within a country or with neighboring states, or availability and affordability of vehicles.

In LHT, traffic keeps left and cars usually have the steering wheel on the right (RHD: right-hand drive) and roundabouts circulate clockwise. RHT is the opposite: traffic keeps right, the driver usually sits on the left side of the car (LHD: left-hand drive), and roundabouts circulate anticlockwise.

In most countries, rail traffic follows the handedness of the roads; but many of the countries that switched road traffic from LHT to RHT did not switch their trains. Boat traffic on bodies of water is RHT, regardless of location. Boats are traditionally piloted from the starboard side (and not the port side like RHT road traffic vehicles) to facilitate priority to the right.

==Background==
Historically, many places kept left, while many others kept right, often within the same country. There are many myths that attempt to explain why one or the other is preferred. About 90 percent of people are right-handed, and many explanations reference this. Horses are traditionally mounted from the left, and led from the left, with the reins in the right hand. So people walking horses might use RHT, to keep the animals separated. Also referenced is the need for pedestrians to keep their swords in the right hand and pass on the left as in LHT, for self-defence. It has been suggested that wagon-drivers whipped their horses with their right hand, and thus sat on the left-hand side of the wagon, as in RHT. Academic Chris McManus notes that writers have stated that in 1300, Pope Boniface VIII directed pilgrims to keep left; others suggest that he directed them to keep to the right, and there is no documented evidence to back either claim.

===Africa===
The UK introduced LHT in the East Africa Protectorate (present-day Kenya), the Protectorate of Uganda, Tanganyika (formerly part of German East Africa; present-day Tanzania), Rhodesia (present-day Zambia/Zimbabwe), Eswatini and the Cape Colony (present-day South Africa and Lesotho), as well as in British West Africa (present-day Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria); former British West Africa, however, has now switched to RHT, as all its neighbours, which are former French colonies, use RHT. South Africa, formerly the Cape Colony, introduced LHT in former German South West Africa, present-day Namibia, after the end of World War I.

Sudan, formerly part of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, switched to RHT in 1973. Most of its neighbours were RHT countries, with the exception of Uganda and Kenya, but since the independence of South Sudan in 2011, all of its neighbours drive on the right (including South Sudan, despite its land borders with two LHT countries).

Although Portugal switched to RHT in 1928, its colony of Mozambique remained LHT because it has land borders with former British colonies (with LHT).

France introduced RHT in French West Africa and the Maghreb, where it is still used. Countries in these areas include Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Other French former colonies that are RHT include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo.

Rwanda and Burundi are RHT but are considering switching to LHT (see &quot;Potential future shifts&quot; section below).

===Americas===
====United States====
In the late 18th century, right-hand traffic started to be introduced in the United States based on teamsters&#x27; use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses and without a driver&#x27;s seat; the (typically right-handed) postilion held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse, and therefore preferred other wagons passing on the left so that he would have a clear view of other vehicles. The first keep-right law for driving in the United States was passed in 1792 and applied to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. Massachusetts formalized RHT in 1821. However, the National Road was LHT until 1850, &quot;long after the rest of the country had settled on the keep-right convention&quot;. Today the United States is RHT except the United States Virgin Islands, which is LHT like many neighbouring islands.

Some special-purpose vehicles in the United States, like certain postal service trucks, garbage trucks, and parking-enforcement vehicles, are built with the driver&#x27;s seat on the right for safer and easier access to the curb. A common example is the Grumman LLV, which is used nationwide by the US Postal Service and by Canada Post.

====Other countries in the Americas====
In Canada, the provinces of Quebec and Ontario were always RHT because they were created out of the former French colony of New France. The province of British Columbia changed to RHT in stages from 1920 to 1923, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island in 1922, 1923, and 1924 respectively, and the Dominion of Newfoundland (part of Canada since 1949) in 1947, in order to allow traffic (without side switch) to or from the United States.

In the West Indies, colonies and territories drive on the same side as their parent countries, except for the United States Virgin Islands. Many of the island nations are former British colonies and drive on the left, including Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and The Bahamas. However, most vehicles in The Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and both the British Virgin Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands are LHD due to their being imported from the United States.

Brazil, a Portuguese colony until the early 19th century, had in the 19th and the early 20th century mixed rules, with some regions still on LHT, switching these remaining regions to RHT in 1928, the same year Portugal switched sides. Other Central and South American countries that later switched from LHT to RHT include Argentina, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

Suriname, along with neighbouring Guyana, are the only two remaining LHT countries in South America.

===Asia===
LHT was introduced by the UK in British India (now India, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh), British Malaya and British Borneo (now Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore), as well as British Hong Kong. These countries, except Myanmar, are still LHT, as well as neighbouring countries Bhutan and Nepal. Myanmar switched to RHT in 1970, although much of its infrastructure is still geared to LHT as its neighbours India, Bangladesh and Thailand use LHT. Most cars are used RHD vehicles imported from Japan. Afghanistan was LHT until the 1950s, in line with Pakistan (former part of British India).

Although Portuguese Timor (present-day East Timor), which shares the island of Timor with Indonesia, who is LHT, switched to RHT with Portugal in 1928, it switched back to LHT in 1976 during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.

In the 1930s, parts of China such as the Shanghai International Settlement, Canton and Japanese-occupied northeast China used LHT. However, in 1946 the Republic of China made RHT mandatory in China (including Taiwan). Taiwan was LHT under Japanese colonization from 1895–1945. Portuguese Macau (present-day Macau) remained LHT, along with British Hong Kong, despite being transferred to China in 1999 and 1997 respectively.

Both North Korea and South Korea use RHT since 1946, after liberation from Japanese colonialization.

The Philippines was mostly LHT during its Spanish and American colonial periods, as well as during the Commonwealth era. During the Japanese occupation, the Philippines remained LHT, as was required by the Japanese; but during the Battle of Manila, the liberating American forces drove their tanks to the right for easier facilitation of movement. RHT was formalized in 1945 through a decree by president Sergio Osmeña. Even though RHT was formalized, RHD vehicles such as public buses were still imported into the Philippines until a law passed banning the importation of RHD vehicles except in special cases. These RHD vehicles are required to be converted to LHD.

Japan was never part of the British Empire, but its traffic also drives on the left. Although this practice goes back to the Edo period (1603–1868), it was not until 1872 – the year Japan&#x27;s first railway was introduced, built with technical aid from the British – that this unwritten rule received official acknowledgment. Gradually, a massive network of railways and tram tracks was built, with all railway vehicles driven on the left-hand side. However, it took another half-century, until 1924, until left-hand traffic was legally mandated. Post-World War II Okinawa was ruled by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands until 1972, and was RHT until 6 a.m. the morning of 30 July 1978, when it switched back to LHT. The conversion operation was known as 730 (&quot;Nana-San-Maru&quot;, which refers to the date of the changeover). Okinawa is one of only a few places to have changed from RHT to LHT in the late 20th century. While Japan drives on the left and most Japanese vehicles are RHD, imported vehicles (e.g. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche) are generally bought as LHD since LHD cars are considered to be status symbols.

Vietnam became RHT as part of French Indochina, as did Laos and Cambodia. In Cambodia, RHD cars, many of which were smuggled from Thailand, were banned in 2001, even though they accounted for 80% of vehicles in the country.

===Europe===
In a study of the ancient traffic system of Pompeii, Eric Poehler was able to show that drivers of carts drove in the middle of the road whenever possible. This was the case even on roads wide enough for two lanes. The wear marks on the kerbstones, however, prove that when there were two lanes of traffic, and the volume of traffic made it necessary to divide the lanes, the drivers always drove on the right-hand side. These considerations can also be demonstrated in the archaeological findings of other cities in the Roman Empire.

One of the first references in England to requiring traffic direction was an order by the London Court of Aldermen in 1669, requiring a man to be posted on London Bridge to ensure that &quot;all cartes going to keep on the one side and all cartes coming to keep on the other side&quot;. It was later legislated as the London Bridge Act 1756 (29 Geo. 2 c. 40), which required that &quot;all carriages passing over the said bridge from London shall go on the east side thereof&quot; – those going south to remain on the east, i.e. the left-hand side by direction of travel. This may represent the first statutory requirement for LHT.

In the Kingdom of Ireland, a law of 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 56 (I)) provided a ten-shilling fine to anyone not driving or riding on the left side of the road within the county of the city of Dublin, and required the local road overseers to erect written or printed notices informing road users of the law. The Road in Down and Antrim Act 1798 (38 Geo. 3. c. 28 (I)) required drivers on the road from Dublin to Donadea to keep to the left. This time, the punishment was ten shillings if the offender was not the owner of the vehicle, or one Irish pound (twenty shillings) if he/she was. The Grand Juries (Ireland) Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4 c. 116) mandated LHT for the whole country, violators to be fined up to five shillings and imprisoned in default for up to one month.

An oft-repeated story is that Napoleon changed the custom from LHT to RHT in France and the countries he conquered after the French Revolution. Scholars who have looked for documentary evidence of this story have found none, and contemporary sources have not surfaced, In 1827, long after Napoleon&#x27;s reign, Edward Planta wrote that, in Paris, &quot;The coachmen have no established rule by which they drive on the right or left of the road, but they cross and jostle one another without ceremony.&quot;

Rotterdam had no fixed rules until 1917, although the rest of the Netherlands was RHT. In May 1917 the police in Rotterdam ended traffic chaos by enforcing right hand traffic.

In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.
After the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up, the resulting countries gradually changed to RHT. In Austria, Vorarlberg switched in 1921, North Tyrol in 1930, Carinthia and East Tyrol in 1935, and the rest of the country in 1938. In Romania, Transylvania, the Banat and Bukovina were LHT until 1919, while Wallachia and Moldavia were already RHT. Partitions of Poland belonging to the German Empire and the Russian Empire were RHT, while the former Austrian Partition changed in the 1920s. Croatia-Slavonia switched on joining the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, although Istria and Dalmatia were already RHT. The switch in Czechoslovakia from LHT to RHT had been planned for 1939, but was accelerated by the start of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia that year.

In Italy, it had been decreed in 1901 that each province define its own traffic code, including the handedness of traffic, and the 1903 Baedeker guide reported that the rule of the road varied by region. For example, in Northern Italy, the provinces of Brescia, Como, Vicenza, and Ravenna were RHT while nearby provinces of Lecco, Verona, and Varese were LHT, as were the cities Milan, Turin, and Florence. In 1915, allied forces of World War I imposed LHT in areas of military operation, but this was revoked in 1918. Rome was reported by Goethe as LHT in the 1780s. Naples was also LHT although surrounding areas were often RHT. In cities, LHT was considered safer since pedestrians, accustomed to keeping right, could better see oncoming vehicular traffic. In 1923 Benito Mussolini decreed that all LHT areas would gradually transition to RHT.

Portugal switched to RHT in 1928.

Finland, formerly part of LHT Sweden, switched to RHT in 1858 as the Grand Duchy of Finland by Russian decree.

Spain switched to RHT in 1918, but not in the entire country. In Madrid people continued to drive on the left until 1924 when a national law forced drivers in Madrid switch to RHT. Madrid Metro still uses LHT.

Sweden switched to RHT in 1967, having been LHT from about 1734 despite having land borders with RHT countries Norway and Finland, and approximately 90% of cars being left-hand drive (LHD). A referendum in 1955 overwhelmingly rejected a change to RHT, but, a few years later, the government ordered it and it occurred on Sunday, 3 September 1967 at 5 am. The accident rate then dropped sharply, but soon rose to near its original level. The day was known as Högertrafikomläggningen, or Dagen H for short.

When Iceland switched to RHT the following year, it was known as &quot;Hægri dagurinn&quot; or &quot;H-dagurinn&quot; (&quot;The H-Day&quot;). Most passenger cars in Iceland were already LHD.

The United Kingdom is LHT, but two of its overseas territories, Gibraltar and the British Indian Ocean Territory, are RHT. In the late 1960s, the British Department for Transport considered switching to RHT, but declared it unsafe and too costly for such a built-up nation. Road building standards, for motorways in particular, allow asymmetrically designed road junctions, where merge and diverge lanes differ in length.

Today, four countries in Europe continue to use LHT, all island nations: the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland (formerly part of the UK), Cyprus and Malta (both former British colonies).

=== Oceania ===
Many former British colonies in the region have always been LHT, including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu; and nations that were previously administered by Australia: Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

==== New Zealand ====

Initially traffic was slow and very sparse, but, as early as 1856, a newspaper said, &quot;The cart was near to the right hand kerb. According to the rules of the road, it should have been on the left side. In turning sharp round a right-hand corner, a driver should keep away to the opposite side.&quot; That rule was codified when the first Highway Code was written in 1936.

==== Samoa ====
Samoa, a former German colony, had been RHT for more than a century, but switched to LHT in 2009, making it the first territory in almost 30 years to change sides. The move was legislated in 2008 to allow Samoans to use cheaper vehicles imported from Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, and to harmonise with other South Pacific nations. A political party, The People&#x27;s Party, was formed by the group People Against Switching Sides (PASS) to protest against the change, with PASS launching a legal challenge; in April 2008 an estimated 18,000 people attended demonstrations against switching. The motor industry was also opposed, as 14,000 of Samoa&#x27;s 18,000 vehicles were designed for RHT and the government refused to meet the cost of conversion. After months of preparation, the switch from right to left happened in an atmosphere of national celebration. There were no reported incidents. At 05:50 local time, Monday 7 September, a radio announcement halted traffic, and an announcement at 6:00 ordered traffic to switch to LHT. The change coincided with more restrictive enforcement of speeding and seat-belt laws. That day and the following were declared public holidays, to reduce traffic. The change included a three-day ban on alcohol sales, while police mounted dozens of checkpoints, warning drivers to drive slowly.

=== Potential future shifts ===

Rwanda and Burundi, former Belgian colonies in Central Africa, are RHT but are considering switching to LHT like neighbouring members of the East African Community (EAC). A survey in 2009 found that 54% of Rwandans favoured the switch. Reasons cited were the perceived lower costs of RHD vehicles, easier maintenance and the political benefit of harmonising traffic regulations with other EAC countries. The survey indicated that RHD cars were 16% to 49% cheaper than their LHD counterparts. In 2014, an internal report by consultants to the Ministry of Infrastructure recommended a switch to LHT. In 2015, the ban on RHD vehicles was lifted; RHD trucks from neighbouring countries cost $1,000 less than LHD models imported from Europe.

==Changing sides at borders==
Although many LHT jurisdictions are on islands, there are cases where vehicles may be driven from LHT across a border into a RHT area. Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 78 countries that have ratified it.

LHT Thailand has three RHT neighbours: Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. Most of its borders use a simple traffic light to do the switch, but there are also interchanges that enable the switch while keeping up a continuous flow of traffic.

There are six road border crossing points between Hong Kong and mainland China. In 2006, the daily average number of vehicle trips recorded at Lok Ma Chau was 31,100. The next largest is Man Kam To, where there is no changeover system and the border roads on the mainland side Wenjindu intersect as one-way streets with a main road.

The Takutu River Bridge (which links LHT Guyana and RHT Brazil) is the only border in the Americas where traffic changes sides.

==Road vehicle configurations==
===Steering wheel position===

In RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are typically configured as left hand drive (LHD), with the steering wheel on the left side of the passenger compartment. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true as the right hand drive (RHD) configuration. In most jurisdictions, the position of the steering wheel is not regulated, or explicitly permitted to be anywhere. The driver&#x27;s side, the side closer to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the &quot;offside&quot;, while the passenger side, the side closer to the side of the road, is sometimes called the &quot;nearside&quot;.

Most windscreen wipers are preferentially designed to better clean the driver&#x27;s side of the windscreen and thus have a longer wiper blade on the driver&#x27;s side and wipe up from the passenger side to the driver&#x27;s side. Thus on LHD configurations, they wipe up from right to left, viewed from inside the vehicle, and do the opposite on RHD vehicles.

In both LHD and RHD vehicles, gear shifters are in the same position, and the shift patterns are not reversed.

Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD. In 1908 Henry Ford standardised the Model T as LHD in RHT America, arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to &quot;get out on the street side and walk around the car&quot; and that with steering from the left, the driver &quot;is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger.&quot; By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford&#x27;s lead, due to the popularity of the Model T.

In specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or curbside. Examples include:
*Where the driver needs a good view of the nearside, e.g. street sweepers, or vehicles driven along unstable road edges. Similarly in mountainous areas the driver may be seated opposite side so that they have a better view of the road edge which may fall away for very many metres into the valley below. Swiss Postbuses in mountainous areas are a well known example.
*Where it is more convenient for the driver to be on the nearside, e.g. delivery vehicles. The Grumman LLV postal delivery truck is widely used with RHD configurations in RHT North America. Some Unimogs are designed to switch between LHD and RHD to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck.

Generally, the convention is to mount a motorcycle on the left, and kickstands are usually on the left which makes it more convenient to mount on the safer kerbside as is the case in LHT. Some jurisdictions prohibit fitting a sidecar to a motorcycle&#x27;s offside.

In 2020, there were 160 LHD heavy goods vehicles in the UK involved in accidents (%) for a total of 3,175 accidents, killing 215 people (%) for a total of 4271.

It has been suggested that right-hand drive vehicles, and hence the left-hand traffic direction, are associated with greater safety. As most drivers are right-handed, the dominant right hand remains controlled on the steering wheel while the non-dominant left hand can manipulate gears. The right field of vision may also be more dominant, thereby permitting a superior view of oncoming traffic.

===Dashboard configuration===

Some manufacturers primarily produce left-hand drive vehicles, due to the larger or nearer market for such vehicles. For such models supplied to left-hand traffic markets, in the right-hand drive configuration, the manufacturer may reuse the same dashboard configuration as is used in the left-hand drive models, with the steering column and pedals moved to the right-hand side. Oft-used controls (such as audio volume and fan controls) that were placed near the left-hand driver for ease of access, are now situated on the far side of the center console for the right-hand driver. This may make them more difficult to reach quickly or without looking away from the road ahead.

In some cases, the manufacturer&#x27;s dashboard design incorporates blanks and modular components, which permits the controls and underlying electronics to be rearranged to suit the right-hand drive model. This may be done in the factory, after import, or as an after-market modification.

===Headlamps and other lighting equipment===

Most low-beam headlamps produce an asymmetrical light suitable for use on only one side of the road. Low beam headlamps in LHT jurisdictions throw most of their light forward-leftward; those for RHT throw most of their light forward-rightward, thus illuminating obstacles and road signs while minimising glare for oncoming traffic.

In Europe, headlamps approved for use on one side of the road must be adaptable to produce adequate illumination with controlled glare for temporarily driving on the other side of the road. This may be achieved by affixing masking strips or prismatic lenses to a part of the lens or by moving all or part of the headlamp optic so all or part of the beam is shifted or the asymmetrical portion is occluded. Some varieties of the projector-type headlamp can be fully adjusted to produce a proper LHT &quot;or&quot; RHT beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly. Some vehicles adjust the headlamps automatically when the car&#x27;s GPS detects that the vehicle has moved from LHT to RHT and vice versa.

====Rear fog lamps====
In Europe since early 1980s, cars must be equipped with one or two red rear fog lamps. A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle&#x27;s longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver&#x27;s side of the vehicle.

===Crash testing differences===
ANCAP reports that some RHD cars imported to Australia did not perform as well on crash tests as the LHD versions, although the cause is unknown, and may be due to differences in testing methodology.

==Rail traffic==

=== National rail ===
In most countries rail traffic travels on the same side as road traffic. However, there are many instances of railways built using LHT British technology which remained LHT despite their nations&#x27; road traffic becoming RHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, China, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Morocco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Uruguay and Venezuela. France is mainly LHT for trains except for the classic lines in Alsace–Lorraine, which were converted from LHT to RHT under German administration from 1870 to 1918. In North America, multi-track rail lines with centralized traffic control are typically signaled to allow operation on any track in both directions, and the side of operation will vary based on the railroad&#x27;s specific operational requirements. In practice however, rail traffic is more often RHT. Indonesia is the only country in the world which has RHT for rails (even for newer rail systems such as the LRT and the MRT systems) and LHT for roads.

=== Metro/Tram/Light rail ===
Metro and light rail sides of operation vary and might not match railways or roads in their country. Some systems where the metro matches the side of the national rail network but not the roads include those in Bilbao, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Catania, Jakarta, Lisbon, Lyon, Naples, and Rome. A small number of cities, including Madrid and Stockholm, originally ran on the same side as road traffic when the systems opened in 1919 and 1950 respectively, but had road traffic change in 1924 and 1967 respectively. Conversely, metros in France (except for the aforementioned Lyon) and mainland China run on the right just like roads, while mainline trains run on the left.

A small number of systems have situational reasons to differ from the norm. On the MTR in Hong Kong, the section originally known as the Ma On Shan line (now part of the Tuen Ma line) runs on the right to make interchanging with the East Rail line easier, while the rest of the system runs on the left. On the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, lines that integrate with Korail (except Line 3, which is disconnected from the rest of the network) run on the left, while the lines that are not run on the right. In Nizhny Novgorod, Line 2 runs on the left due to the track layout when it first opened as a branch of Line 1. In Lima, Line 1 runs entirely on the left, while Line 2 runs entirely on the right.

Metro Line M1 in Budapest is the only metro line to have switched sides. It originally ran on the left but switched to right hand-running during the line&#x27;s reconstruction around 1973.

The former Rochester subway, that operated from 1927 to 1956 ran on the left to let unidirectional vehicles with doors on the right use stations with island platforms.

Because trams frequently operate on roads, they generally operate on the same side as other road traffic.

==Boat traffic==
Boats are traditionally piloted from starboard (the right-hand side) to facilitate priority to the right. 
According to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to starboard, and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also.

Typically, especially for larger vessels, a radio call will be made between two vessels, or with a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) to co-ordinate if the vessels will pass &quot;green-to-green&quot; or &quot;red-to-red&quot;. Marine traffic uses a system of green lighting for the starboard (right-hand) side and red for port (left-hand) side: to pass &quot;green-to-green&quot; the green (starboard, right-hand) side of the vessels will pass each other, essentially being left-hand traffic. Similarly, passing &quot;red-to-red&quot; means the red (port, left-hand) side of the vessels will pass each other, forming right-hand traffic.

In busy waterways, directional shipping lanes may be set up to facilitate handedness of traffic. For example, the Strait of Dover (Pas-de-Calais) on the English Channel uses RHT with North Sea-bound vessels following the French coast and Atlantic-bound vessels following the English coast.

==Aircraft traffic==
For aircraft the US Federal Aviation Regulations suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat. However, helicopter practice tends to favour the right hand seat for the pilot-in-command, particularly when flying solo.

==Worldwide distribution by country==
Of the 195 countries currently recognised by the United Nations, 141 use RHT and 54 use LHT on roads in general.

A country and its territories and dependencies are counted as one. Whichever directionality is listed first is the type that is used in general in the traffic category.

===Legality of wrong-hand-drive vehicles by country===

According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which mostly covers Europe, if having a vehicle registered and legal to drive in one of the Convention countries, it is legal to drive it in any other of the countries, for visits and first year of residence after moving. This is regardless of whether it fulfils all the rules of the visitor countries. This convention does not affect rules on usage or registration of local vehicles.

<text>Holdenby House is a historic country house in Northamptonshire, traditionally pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Holmby. The house is situated in the parish of Holdenby, six miles (10 km) northwest of Northampton and close to Althorp. It is a Grade II* listed building.

== History ==
The house was completed in 1583 by the Elizabethan Lord Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, who refused to sleep a night in the mansion until Queen Elizabeth I had slept there. Thomas Heneage stayed at Holdenby in July 1583, and wrote to Hatton, congratulating him on the completion of &quot;the best house that hath been built in this age&quot;.

It was one of the largest prodigy houses of the Tudor period, rivalling in size both Audley End and Theobalds, and was reputed to occupy approximately 78,750 square feet (7,300 m²), although this probably included the two great courtyards around which it was built. The facades were symmetrical, with mullioned windows and open Doric arcades, reflecting the Renaissance style of architecture gradually spreading from Italy. Hatton died in 1591.

In 1607, after a survey by John Thorpe, the mansion was bought by Elizabeth&#x27;s successor James I. He intended it as a residence for his son, Charles, Duke of York. His wife Anne of Denmark stayed at Holdenby in August 1608.

In February 1647, after the First English Civil War, Charles I was brought to Holdenby by the Scots and handed over to the English Long Parliament. He remained a prisoner there until June 1647 when Cornet George Joyce seized him and took him to Newmarket in the name of the New Model Army. Parliament later sold the estate to Captain Adam Baynes, who demolished the house almost entirely except for a small domestic wing.

In 1709, Holdenby was bought by the Marlborough family who in turn sold it to their kin the Clifden family whose descendants in the female line, the Lowthers, still own the property . The Clifdens had a new house built in the style of the older mansion, incorporating the older mansion&#x27;s remains but being only about one eighth of its size. The first phase of the new house was designed by the architects Richard Carpenter and William Slater and built in 1873–75. A second phase was designed by Walter Mills and built in 1877–78.

, all that remains of Hatton&#x27;s great house are two Grade I listed archways and the kitchen wing incorporated into the Victorian rebuild, now standing on a lawn, which once gave access to the courtyards; a near-identical third arch bears the date 1659 and so must have been built for Baynes, the Cromwellian owner.

The gardens are listed Grade I.

A door salvaged from the demolition of Holdenby palace is believed to be inside Morningside Cottage, a grade II listed building in the nearby village of Creaton.

==Filming location==
In July 2011, the exterior of Holdenby House was transformed as the location of Satis House in BBC One’s adaptation of Charles Dickens’s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Parts of the film &quot;Biggles&quot; (1986) were filmed at Holdenby. The house featured in a 2020 episode of &quot;An American Aristocrat&#x27;s Guide to Great Estates&quot;.

==Functions and visits==
The estate is a private residence which is available as a corporate and wedding venue and is opened to the public on a limited and paid basis. Other activities include a falconry centre.

<text>Audioslave is the debut studio album by American rock supergroup Audioslave, released on November 18, 2002, through Epic Records and Interscope Records. In the United States, it has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album spawned the singles &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;, and &quot;What You Are&quot;; &quot;Like a Stone&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards.

==Background and release==

After Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, the remaining members of the band began to look for a new vocalist. Producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested they contact Chris Cornell and played them the Soundgarden song &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers&quot; to showcase his ability. Cornell was in the process of writing material for a second solo album when Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk approached him, but he decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with them.

Speaking about the first time Cornell jammed with the band, Morello said: &quot;He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It didn&#x27;t just sound good. It didn&#x27;t sound great. It sounded transcendent. And ... when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can&#x27;t deny it.&quot; The new quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal and started recording their first album in late May 2001.

On March 19, 2002, the band announced they would be part of the 7th Ozzfest tour that summer, but three days later Cornell quit the group, and the Ozzfest dates were canceled. He rejoined the band six weeks later, after some management issues were resolved.

Rough versions of thirteen songs from the album were leaked onto various peer-to-peer file sharing networks on May 17, 2002, six months before the official release of the album, under the name &quot;Civilian&quot; (or &quot;The Civilian Project&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - Rage/Cornell-Credited Tracks Get Leaked Online&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with &quot;Metal Sludge&quot; that July, Morello blamed &quot;some jackass intern at Bad Animal Studios in Seattle&quot; for stealing some demos and putting them on the internet without the band&#x27;s permission. Later, he said that &quot;It was very frustrating, especially with a band like this, there is a certain amount of expectation. For some people the initial time that they are hearing it was not in the form that you would have them hear it. In some cases they weren&#x27;t even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind.&quot;

Cornell was having problems with alcohol while making the album, and in late 2002 there was a rumor that he had checked himself into drug rehabilitation—a rumor that was confirmed when he conducted an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; from a clinic payphone. He later said that he went through &quot;a horrible personal crisis&quot; during the making of the first Audioslave album, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife. He remained sober until shortly before his passing in 2017.

The album was released on November 18, 2002, in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States. The band toured through 2003, before taking a break from the road in 2004 to record their second album.

==Artwork==
The cover was designed by Storm Thorgerson (with Peter Curzon and Rupert Truman) – who, as leader of Hipgnosis, was best known for work for Pink Floyd.

An unreleased version of the cover, featuring a naked man looking at the flame, was shot elsewhere at the same location. &quot;We so nearly used it,&quot; said Thorgerson, &quot;but we were not entirely sure of the nude figure.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical===

&quot;Audioslave&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Some critics lambasted the group&#x27;s efforts as uninspired and predictable.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s reviewers Chris Dahlen and Ryan Schreiber praised Cornell&#x27;s voice, but criticized virtually every other aspect of the album, calling it &quot;the worst kind of studio rock album, rigorously controlled -- even undercut -- by studio gimmickry&quot;. They described Cornell&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;complete gibberish&quot; and called producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s work &quot;a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat&quot;.

Jon Monks from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; also considered Rubin&#x27;s production over-polished and wrote that, &quot;lacking individuality, distinction and imagination this album is over-produced, overlong and over-indulgent&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a mixed three stars out of a possible five, writing: &quot;Occasionally, the group winds up with songs that play to the strengths of both camps,&quot; but more often &quot;many of the songs sound like they&#x27;re just on the verge of achieving liftoff, never quite reaching their potential.&quot;

On the other hand, other critics praised the supergroup&#x27;s style as reminiscent of 1970s heavy metal and compared it to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC – Rock/Indie Review – Audioslave, Audioslave&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; saying Audioslave add a much-needed sound and style to contemporary mainstream rock music and have the potential to become one of the best rock bands of the 21st century.

In 2005, &quot;Audioslave&quot; was ranked number 281 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

===Commercial===
The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at position number seven, after selling 162,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the RIAA less than a month after its release, and by 2006 had achieved triple-platinum status.

It is the most successful Audioslave album to date, having sold more than three million copies in the United States alone. The singles &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; all reached the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart, with &quot;Like a Stone&quot; reaching number one, and those four, plus &quot;What You Are&quot;, reached the top ten of the Mainstream Rock chart, with &quot;Like a Stone&quot; again reaching the top spot.

==Track listing==
===DualDisc version===
The album was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test-marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc has the standard album on one side and bonus material on the other side. The DVD side of the &quot;Audioslave&quot; DualDisc featured the entire album in higher resolution 48 kHz sound, as well as some videos. The higher resolution DVD side of this disc has been called a demonstration-quality audiophile release.

===ConnecteD bonus track===
For a limited time, the CD could be inserted into a CD-ROM drive and used to access the ConnecteD website. Here, the user was able to download bonus videos, interviews, photos, and a bonus track (&quot;Give&quot;).

<doc id="213383" wikidata="Q1345314" url="?curid=213383" title="Good governance">
<text>Good governance is the process of measuring how public institutions conduct public affairs and manage public resources and guarantee the realization of human rights in a manner essentially free of abuse and corruption and with due regard for the rule of law. Governance is &quot;the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented)&quot;. Governance in this context can apply to corporate, international, national, or local governance as well as the interactions between other sectors of society.

The concept of &quot;good governance&quot; thus emerges as a model to compare ineffective economies or political bodies with viable economies and political bodies. The concept centers on the responsibility of governments and governing bodies to meet the needs of the masses as opposed to select groups in society. Because countries often described as &quot;most successful&quot; are liberal-democratic states, concentrated in Europe and the Americas, good governance standards often measure other state institutions against these states. Aid organizations and the authorities of developed countries often will focus the meaning of &quot;good governance&quot; to a set of requirements that conform to the organization&#x27;s agenda, making &quot;good governance&quot; imply many different things in many different contexts.

==In politics==
Good governance in the New Yorkish context of countries is a broad term, and in that regards, it is difficult to find a unique definition. According to Fukuyama (2013), the ability of the state and the independence of the bureaucracy are the two factors that determine whether governance is excellent or terrible. They also complement one another in that more autonomy should be allowed when the state is more capable, such as through tax collection, since bureaucrats can carry out their duties well without much guidance. However, less latitude and greater regulation are preferable in states with lower levels of capability.

A further perspective on effective governance is based on results. There is no better way to think about good governance than through deliverables, which are precisely the ones demanded by citizens, like security, health, education, water, contract enforcement, property protection, environmental protection, and the right to vote and fair wages. This is because governments operate with the intention of providing public goods to their constituents.

Similarly, good governance might be approximated with provision of public services in an efficient manner, higher participation given to certain groups in the population like the poor and the minorities, the guarantee that citizens have the opportunity of checks and balances on the government, the establishment and enforcement of norms for the protection of the citizens and their property and the existence of independent judiciary systems.

Lawson (2011) in his review of Rothstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Quality of Government: Corruption, Social Trust, and Inequality in International Perspective&quot; mentions that the author relates good governance to the concept of impartiality, which is basically when the bureaucrats perform their tasks following the public interest rather than their self-interest. Lawson differs with him in that this impartial application of law ignores important factors like the economic liberalism, which matters due to its relation with economic growth.

The efficiency of one-party governments might seem appealing, but leaders need a deep understanding of a country&#x27;s power structure and &quot;moral economy&quot;, says Meg Rithmire. Her book &quot;Precarious Ties: Business and the State in Authoritarian Asia&quot; explores the delicate relationship between capitalists and autocrats in the region.

According to Bo Rothstein and Jan Teorell, the key characteristic of good governance is the impartiality of government institutions.

== In business ==
In corporate affairs, good governance can be observed in any of the following relationships:

* between governance and corporate management
* between governance and employee standards
* between governance and corruption in the workplace

The meaning of good governance in regards to corporate sectors varies between actors. Legislation has been enacted in an attempt to influence good governance in corporate affairs. In the United States, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 set up requirements for businesses to follow. Whistleblowing has also been widely used by corporations to expose corruption and fraudulent activity.

==Reform and standards==
Three institutions can be reformed to promote good governance: the state, the private sector and civil society. However, among different cultures, the need and demand for reform can vary depending on the priorities of that country&#x27;s society. A variety of country level initiatives and international movements put emphasis on various types of governance reform. Each movement for reform establishes criteria for what they consider good governance based on their own needs and agendas. The following are examples of good governance standards for prominent organizations in the international community.

===United Nations===
The United Nations (UN) is playing an increasing role in good governance. According to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, &quot;Good governance is ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law; strengthening democracy; promoting transparency and capacity in public administration.&quot; To implement this, the UN follows eight principles:

* Participation – People should be able to voice their own opinions through legitimate immediate organizations or representatives.
* Rule of Law – Legal framework should be enforced impartially, especially on human right laws.
* Consensus Oriented – Mediates differing interests to meet the broad consensus on the best interests of a community.
* Equity and Inclusiveness – People should have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being. 
* Effectiveness and Efficiency – Processes and institutions should be able to produce results that meet the needs of their community while making the best of their resources.
* Accountability – Governmental institutions, private sectors, and civil society organizations should be held accountable to the public and institutional stakeholders.
* Transparency – Information should be accessible to the public and should be understandable and monitored.
* Responsiveness – Institutions and processes should serve all stakeholders.

===International Monetary Fund===
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created at a United Nations (UN) conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. In 1996, the IMF declared &quot;promoting good governance in all its aspects, including by ensuring the rule of law, improving the efficiency and accountability of the public sector, and tackling corruption, as essential elements of a framework within which economies can prosper&quot;. The IMF feels that corruption within economies is caused by the ineffective governance of the economy, either too much regulation or too little regulation. To receive loans from the IMF, countries must have certain good governance policies, as determined by the IMF, in place.

===World Bank===
The World Bank introduced the concept in its 1992 report entitled &quot;Governance and Development&quot;. According to the document, good governance is an essential complement to sound economic policies and is central to creating and sustaining an environment which fosters strong and equitable development. For the World Bank, good governance consists of the following components: capacity and efficiency in public sector management, accountability, legal framework for development, and information and transparency.

The Worldwide Governance Indicators is a program funded by the World Bank to measure the quality of governance of over 200 countries. It uses six dimensions of governance for their measurements, Voice &amp; Accountability, Political Stability and Lack of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. They have been studying countries since 1996.

==Effects==

===International humanitarian funding===
Good governance defines an ideal that is difficult to achieve in full, though it is something development supporters consider supporting. Major donors and international financial institutions, like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Bank, are basing their aid and loans on the condition that the recipient undertakes reforms ensuring good governance. Several bilateral donors, such as the US Government&#x27;s Millennium Challenge Corporation require countries to meet certain standards of good governance prior to receiving assistance. These conditions are due to the close link between poor governance and corruption, the connection between good governance and aid effectiveness, and the relationship between good governance and poverty reduction.

===Democratization===
Because concepts such as civil society, decentralisation, peaceful conflict management and accountability are often used when defining the concept of good governance, the definition of good governance promotes many ideas that closely align with effective democratic governance. Not surprisingly, emphasis on good governance can sometimes be equated with promoting democratic government. However, a 2011 literature review analyzing the link between democracy and development by Alina Rocha Menocal of the Overseas Development Institute stresses the inconclusiveness of evidence on this relationship.

====Example====
A good example of this close association, for some actors, between western democratic governance and the concept of good governance is the following statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Nigeria on August 12, 2009:

=== Poverty ===
A range of sources have found linkages between poverty reduction and good governance. Some find that growth is most effective at reducing poverty in well governed countries. Others find that there is a direct impact of good governance on poverty reduction. Some studies find that good governance above a certain level contributes positively to poverty reduction. Others still find a relationship between governance and poverty even controlling for economic growth, indicating an independent association.

==Criticism==
According to Sam Agere, &quot;The discretionary space left by the lack of a clear well-defined scope for what governance encompasses allows users to choose and set their own parameters.&quot;

In the book &quot;Contesting &#x27;good&#x27; governance&quot;, Eva Poluha and Mona Rosendahl contest standards that are common to western democracy as measures of &quot;goodness&quot; in government. By applying political anthropological methods, they conclude that while governments believe they apply concepts of good governance while making decisions, cultural differences can cause conflict with the heterogeneous standards of the international community.

An additional source of good governance criticism is &quot;The Intelligent Person&#x27;s Guide to Good Governance&quot;, written by Surendra Munshi. Munshi&#x27;s work was created in order to &quot;revive&quot; good governance. Many individuals tend to either wave away and be bored with the idea of governance, or not have a clue to what it has at all. This book is a generalized discussion on what the purpose of good governance is and how it serves that purpose throughout our society. Munshi targets the book toward anyone doing research or just simply &quot;those concerned with the issue of governance&quot;.

&quot;Rethinking Systems: Configurations of Politics and Policy in Contemporary Governance&quot;, written by Michael P. Crozier, is another work analyzing good governance. Crozier&#x27;s article discusses the different dynamics of changes that occur throughout communication systems and the effect it has on governance. The idea of various perspectives is presented throughout the article. This allows the reader to be able to see what contemporary governance is like from different viewpoints. Crozier&#x27;s motive was to also create an open mindset when referring to how governance and policy within society operate, especially with the constant changes occurring day to day.

Recent criticism has been aimed at the idea that good governance and institutions are one of the primary explanatory variables of economic growth, such as argued by Kaufmann and Kraay and Acemoglu and Robinson, which has put institutional reforms high on global development agendas. The criticism is fundamentally concerned with the issue that the relatively few countries which have managed to develop rapidly over the last 70 years did not have the &quot;right&quot; kind of institutions; in contrast, countries like China and South Korea have been plagued by corruption and a lack of checks-and-balances during their development trajectories. Or as the development economist Dani Rodrik put it: &quot;A development strategy that focused on anti-corruption in China would not have produced anything like the growth rate that this country has experienced since 1978, nor would it have resulted in 400 million plus fewer people in extreme poverty.&quot;

As a result, it has been pointed out that anti-corruption efforts and government reforms can have very negative consequences in especially fragile countries there can be significantly bigger barriers to economic growth than corruption or institutional quality, and anti-corruption efforts and governance reforms often fail because of a suboptimal understanding of local socio-political contexts.

Various authors have furthermore argued that &quot;good governance&quot; provides a very unhelpful development agenda as it is unclear what the &quot;right&quot; kind of institutions are or how they should be realized even if we were to accept that they are necessary or helpful.

<doc id="213388" wikidata="Q764263" url="?curid=213388" title="Oatlands, Surrey">
<text>Oatlands is a village in the north of the English county of Surrey, contiguous with the towns of Weybridge to the west and Walton on Thames to the east, and set on low, verdant ridges partially overlooking the River Thames. Oatlands acquired its name from the Royal Tudor and Stuart Oatlands Palace, which was built for Henry VIII to the north of Weybridge town centre. Before acquiring its first place of worship it was part of Walton on Thames, and shortly after thereby becoming a village did not qualify for post town status and instead its post town became Weybridge. The towns it adjoins have their centres away. Oatlands has a park, parade of shops, one pub, one Working Men&#x27;s Club, and three schools.

Administratively its borough of Elmbridge electoral ward is Oatlands Park, and its Surrey electoral division is Walton South and Oatlands.

==Geography==
The village is elevated from the London Basin and has gentle slopes down to the old village in a slight dip and to Walton-on-Thames. The roads are characterised by many avenues and garden-fronted properties surrounded by parkland, no intersection by any major roads, with low rise apartments being a relatively common feature. The Weybridge Club spa resort and Broadwater lie to the north of the Oatlands Park Hotel within the lower London Basin. Several fine elevated views can be enjoyed from apartments on Oatlands Drive, reflected in names such as Ridgemount, Broadwater Place, Lakeside, Oakhill Gardens and Tower Grove. The architecture across the village is predominantly of classical, Georgian inspiration to complement the small group of terraced houses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and grander, detached Georgian houses bordering on the approach to Monument Hill, which links Oatlands to Weybridge town centre. There are no dual carriageways around or within the village. The closest railway station is Walton-on-Thames, 1/2-mile from St Marys, Oatlands church to the south-east of the village, with a 25-minute one stop service in the mornings and evenings to London Waterloo.

===Soil===
The soil even in the majority of the upland parts has few pockets of sand (supporting fern, gorse, bog and conifers) compared to Weybridge Heath and the large areas of West Surrey former proper heath on the Bagshot sand, with the general mixture of gravel and alluvial deposits producing medium fertility and naturally conducive to open pasture or orchards.

==Amenities==
In an approximately park with outdoor pool and play areas, Oatlands Park is set back on its own drive on the south side of Oatlands Drive. This is opposite the Oatlands Park Hotel, the 19th Century building sited in the grounds of the former royal palace. There is a parade of cafés, fishing and hunting shop, boutiques and a traditional pub in a very small suburban vale in the district. Oatlands Infants school and Cleves School Junior School are within Oatlands.

The district of Oatlands contains an Iron Age burial ground, believed to be in the vicinity of St Mary Oatlands church.

==Places of worship==
The parish of Oatlands exists in the Anglican church also known as St Mary Oatlands. Originally a chapel built in 1862, the parish church was ordained in 1867 and the parish of St Mary Walton in Walton-on-Thames was divided to reflect the increase in population owing to local industrialisation and commuter villas. Vicars have changed in 2005 (Revs Malcolm Anker, Andrew Parsons) and in 2010 (Rev Steve Brunn). In 2012 St Mary celebrated 150 years. On the 4th of July 2017, Revd. Folorunso (Folli) Olokose was installed as the Vicar of the church by Rt Revd Andrew Watson, Bishop of Guildford.

The Christian Science Church founded by Mary Baker Eddy (not to be confused with The Church of Scientology) has a major centre of worship on Oatlands Drive in Oatlands.

The North West Surrey Synagogue is in Rosslyn Park, Oatlands.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the village who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Notable residents==
*Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester (1640–1660), at Oatlands Park.
*William Boteler (fl. 1640s and 1650s), lived at Oatlands Park in the 1660s, he was a member of the Parliament and one of the major-generals during the Rule of the Major-Generals
*Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia (1767–1820), Duchess of York, at Oatlands Park (House).
*Madeleine Albright, 64th United States Secretary of State, went to the school in Oatlands which has been converted into flats next to a large pub/restaurant, The Oatlands Chaser – formerly known as the Badger&#x27;s Rest and The King&#x27;s Manor.
*William Chapman Hewitson (1806–1878), naturalist and lepidopterist. From 1848 lived in Oatlands Park and built a house there.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Huber (18 August 1830 – 20 March 1879), was a German philosophical and theological writer, and a leader of the &quot;Old Catholic Church&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Munich. Originally destined for the priesthood, he studied theology from childhood. The writings of Spinoza and Lorenz Oken attracted him to philosophy, and it was in philosophy that he &quot;habilitated&quot; (1854) in the university of his native place, where he ultimately became professor (extraordinarius, 1859; ordinarius, 1864). With Döllinger and others he attracted a large amount of public attention. Firstly in 1869 by the challenge to the Ultramontane promoters of the First Vatican Council in the treatise &quot;Der Papst und das Koncil&quot;, which appeared under the pseudonym of &quot;Janus,&quot;. Secondly in 1870 by a series of letters (&quot;Römische Briefe&quot;, a redaction of secret reports sent from Rome during the sitting of the council), which were published over the pseudonym &quot;Quirinus&quot; in the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. He died suddenly of heart disease at Munich.

==Works==
*The treatise &quot;Über die Willensfreiheit&quot; (1858), followed in 1859 by &quot;Die Philosophie der Kirchenväter&quot;, which was promptly placed upon the Index, and led to the prohibition of all Catholic students from attending his lectures.

<doc id="213392" wikidata="Q382321" url="?curid=213392" title="Freckled duck">
<text>The freckled duck (&quot;Stictonetta naevosa)&quot; is a waterfowl species endemic to Australia. The freckled duck has also been referred to as the monkey duck or oatmeal duck. These birds are usually present in mainland Australia, but disperse to coastal and subcostal wetlands in the dry period. During such times it is common for the freckled duck population to congregate in flocks in the same area, giving the impression that they are more common than they really are.

The freckled duck population is at risk of further reduction from habitat destruction, droughts and game hunting. Often habitat destruction and drought can lead to an increase in hunting, as the freckled duck is forced to disperse into more coastal ranges where they may not be recognised as a protected species.

In the past few decades, several institutions have established breeding programs to aid in supplementation of the freckled duck population. Such establishments included, but are not restricted to the Hunter Wetlands Centre Australia, Slimbridge Wetlands, Melbourne Zoo, Bronx Zoo, Adelaide Zoo, Healesville Sanctuary, and Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. The success of these institutes has been variable, with some failing to establish self-maintaining colonies.

==Description==

The freckled duck has a distinctive appearance. It is characterised, in adults, by dark grey to black plumage covered with small white flecks, which gives the duck the &#x27;freckled&#x27; look. The feet, legs and bill of both sexes is of a slate grey colour. Hatchlings and juveniles are distinguished by a uniform light grey plumage, which they lose around their 32nd week when they undergo a full body moult to assume the adult plumage.

The adult freckled duck is sexually dimorphic. On average, males are the larger sex, with average weight between 700 - 1200 g. Females have an only slightly lower range between 600 – 1200 g. Both sexes have a length of 50 – 60 cm. During the breeding season particularly, the males are characterised by the base of their culmen, which takes on various shades of red. Those in prime reproductive condition take on a deep red colouring, while other males may only develop lighter shades of red, or in some instances, no colouring at all. Deep red colouring of the culmen is also associated with dominance, and those with the deepest red are those likely to breed with the females of the group.

==Distribution and habitat==

Endemic to Australia, the freckled duck is mainly situated throughout inland regions of the Eastern section of the country—including New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. This species also has known populations in South Australia and Western Australia. Due to habitat requirements, distribution of the freckled duck directly correlates to water flow and rainfall in river catchments and wetland systems. Because of this, main populations of this species are located within the Paroo-Warrego catchment (Currawinya Lakes), Eyre-Georgine-Mulligan catchment (Lake Torquinie), and potentially at Lake Galilee. High numbers have also been recorded at the Cooper&#x27;s Creek catchment, wetlands within the Barkley Tablelands, the Bulloo River catchment and Lake Gregory in central north Western Australia.

Freckled duck habitat preference can be split into two distinct categories: breeding and non-breeding habitat. While this species does not appear to have any sort of distinct migratory pathway or seasonal migration to find suitable breeding habitat. The freckled duck sometimes travels long distances to find a suitable breeding location, and seems to prefer large bodies of fresh water with thick vegetation. Usual contenders are recently flooded wetland systems and swamps. After breeding, the freckled duck disperses to more coastal areas with more permanent bodies of water such as lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. These areas are often more exposed and contain little vegetation.

==Ecology==
===Diet===

The diet of the freckled duck has been subjected to a degree of controversy and disagreement over the years, potentially due to the versatile diet of different populations and distributions of this duck. Despite this, it is widely agreed that the freckled duck is a resilient, specialist filter feeder that consumes a range of aquatic vegetation, insects, algae, larvae and crustaceans. Studies have found that the freckled duck prefers to feed in shallow water, using its bill to strain food particles from the mud or sand.

===Social behaviour===
A highly gregarious species, the freckled duck is known to have flock sizes ranging from 10 to 100 individuals, especially outside of breeding season. During breeding season, these flocks often break up into smaller sub-units, scattered throughout wetland and swamp systems.

Despite these large flock sizes, this species is lacking in demonstrative displays towards one another, with only cryptic gestures and few interactions towards fellow flock mates. The rare interaction that is observed within this species is usually of a quarrelsome nature.

===Bathing===

While there has been little research into the bathing behaviour of the freckled duck, it is known that a body of water (e.g. a swamp or dam) is essential for many natural behaviours such as feeding, mating and bathing. Freckled ducks have been observes preening both within water and after emerging from water while in a roosting position. There is no evidence that the freckled duck dust bathes or requires any other substrate for bathing.

===Reproductive behaviour===

The freckled duck is a polygamous species that undertakes short term, seasonal monogamous pairings in the wild. In this short term pairing, the male defends the receptive female during the pre-egg laying stage of the breeding season. During this time, the male also helps construct and defend the nest site—but leaves before the female lays her clutch, and plays no further role in rearing or defending his offspring.

The freckled duck has few pre or post copulatory behaviours. Copulation occurs in the water with the male approaching a receptive female, who adopts a semi-submerged orientation, with her head stretched outwards and tail raised. The male then mounts the female and clutches the feathers on the lower neck of the female during copulation. After dismounting, both sexes display bathing and preening behaviours.

The breeding season of the freckled duck is basically regular, with a generic breeding season between September and December. However, it retains the ability to breed out of season. Breeding out of season highly correlates with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding.
Both male and female freckled ducks reach sexual maturity at around 12 months of ages when the first breeding occurrence can commence. The freckled duck has been known to continue breeding annually throughout their life, with records suggesting successful breeding in birds in excess to 10 years of age.

The freckled duck has a standard incubation period of between 26 and 28 days, though some sources have recorded incubation periods of up to 35 days. The female is solely responsible for egg incubation and only leaves the eggs for short periods to feed.

The average clutch is seven eggs, but can range between four and 14 eggs. Clutches of up to 14 eggs can occur naturally, though this occurrence mainly appears to be the result of females &#x27;dumping&#x27; additional eggs into another female&#x27;s nest. This occurrence is common within freckled duck populations as it enables the offending females to pass on their genetic material while not expending energy to raise their hatchlings.

The eggs of the freckled duck are glossy, smooth and almost perfectly oval in shape. They are white in colour, ranging from shades of cream to ivory. The freckled duck egg is unique, having an exceptionally thick but soft shell unlike that of any other species. Egg measurements usually fall between 60-65mm by 45-48mm and weigh an average of 66g.

Freckled duck hatchlings are precocial, meaning they hatch fully functional and able to feed themselves. Despite this, they still need their mother for the best chance of survival. Apart from protection, the hatchlings need the mother to teach them important social cues and behaviours.

The ducklings fledge late compared with other waterfowl species, at nine weeks, when they no longer need their mother&#x27;s protection. At this point, the mother and fledglings are likely to re-join a larger flock.(Flinchum, 2005)

==In captivity==

Historically, the freckled duck has been kept with limited success in captivity and ironing out the issues with captive life is still an ongoing issue. Issues with stress, breeding and mortality rates of chicks are amongst the biggest issues with keeping these ducks in captive environments. In recent years some of these concerns have been mitigated with establishments such as the Hunter Wetlands Australia and Slimbridge Wetlands UK implementing successful breeding programs, with chicks surviving to adulthood.

The freckled duck is a highly compatible species, with various establishments holding this species in groups of various sizes, sex ratios and species with no interspecific or intraspecific aggression. However, there has been limited success with breeding programs when housed in mixed exhibits.

Behavioural considerations are another consideration to take into account when holding a captive population of freckled ducks. The most important of these considerations is the possibility of imprinting on a subject other than the mother. Imprinting is an instinctual phenomenon that occurs early on in life whereby the juvenile establishes a long lasting behavioural response to the parent (or another animal, person or thing that is present during the crucial imprinting period). Imprinting on human keepers is a serious consideration, as hatchlings require the mother to learn important behaviour traits—including vocalisations, feeding, and other important attributes.

==Conservation==
The species is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. Population numbers show no definite trend, but appear to be fluctuating quite strongly, with an assessment in 2016 of 7,300 - 17,000 mature individuals. Threats include misidentification of this protected species as a game bird and consequent shooting by hunters. The ongoing destruction of swamp habitat by water diversion schemes is thought to have the capacity to result in a population decline of up to 20% within the next 15 years.
