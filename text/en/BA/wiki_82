<doc id="224153" wikidata="Q539433" url="?curid=224153" title="Diving petrel">
<text>The diving petrels form a genus, Pelecanoides, of seabirds in the family Procellariidae. There are four very similar species of diving petrels, distinguished only by small differences in the coloration of their plumage, habitat, and bill construction. They are only found in the southern hemisphere. The diving petrels were formerly placed in their own family, the Pelecanoididae.

Diving petrels are auk-like small petrels of the southern oceans. The resemblances with the auks are due to convergent evolution, since both families feed by pursuit diving, although some researchers have in the past suggested that the similarities are due to relatedness. Among the Procellariiformes the diving petrels are the family most adapted to life in the sea rather than flying over it, and are generally found closer inshore than other families in the order.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pelecanoides&quot; was introduced in 1799 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède for the common diving petrel. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pelekan &quot; meaning &quot;pelican&quot; and &quot;-oidēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;.

The diving petrels were formerly placed in their own family, Pelecanoididae. When genetic studies found that they were embedded within the family Procellariidae, the family Pelecanoididae were merged into Procellariidae.

===Extant Species===
Four species are usually recognised:
A fifth species, the Whenua Hou diving petrel (&quot;Pelecanoides whenuahouensis&quot;), is sometimes recognised. It was first described in 2018 and is found around Codfish Island / Whenua Hou, New Zealand. In the bird list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee the Whenua Hou diving petrel is treated as a subspecies of the South Georgia diving petrel.

The evolution and systematics of these birds is not well researched. Several populations were described as distinct species and while most of them are only subspecies, some may indeed be distinct. The prehistoric fossil record was long limited to very fragmentary remains described as &quot;P. cymatotrypetes&quot; found in Early Pliocene deposits of Langebaanweg, South Africa; while this bird apparently was close to the common diving petrel, no members of the genus are known from South African waters today.

In 2007, a humerus piece from New Zealand was described as &quot;P. miokuaka&quot;. This was found in Early/Middle Miocene deposits and just as may be expected, it far more resembles diving petrels than any other known bird, but presents a less apomorphic condition.

==Description==
The diving petrels are small petrels that measure between and weigh . They are highly uniform in appearance, and very difficult to distinguish when seen at sea. They are best distinguished by the size and shape of their short bills. The plumage is shining black on the top and white on the underside. Their wings are short, particularly with regards to overall body size, and used in a highly characteristic whirring flight. This flight is low over the water and diving petrels will fly through the crests of waves without any interruption of their flight path. In the water these wings are half folded and used as paddles to propel the bird after its prey.

==Behaviour==

===Food and feeding===
Diving petrels are plankton feeders, taking mostly crustacean prey such as krill, copepods and the amphipod &quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;, also taking small fish and squid. They have several adaptations for obtaining their prey including short powerful wings, a gular pouch for storing food, and their nostrils open upwards rather than pointing forward as in other tubenoses.

===Breeding===
These birds nest in colonies on islands. One white egg is laid in a burrow in turf or soft soil that is usually covered with vegetation, feathers, or small rocks. They are nocturnal at the breeding colonies. It has a long period of parental care (around 45 to 60 days) in the burrow, but once the chick fledges out to sea it is on its own.

==Status and conservation==

Of the four species, two, the Peruvian diving petrel and the Magellanic diving petrel, have highly restricted ranges around South America&#x27;s coasts, while the common diving petrel and the South Georgia diving petrel range widely across the southern oceans, breeding on islands off New Zealand, Subantarctic islands in the Indian Ocean, and islands in the south Atlantic (like Tristan da Cunha). The subspecies, the Whenua Hou diving petrel, has an extremely restricted range, breeding only on New Zealand&#x27;s Codfish Island / Whenua Hou.

Diving petrels are among the world&#x27;s most numerous birds, with common and South Georgia diving petrels numbering several million pairs each. The Peruvian and Whenua Hou diving petrels, on the other hand, are highly threatened by guano extraction, introduced species and climate change, and are considered endangered species.

<doc id="224173" wikidata="Q185832" url="?curid=224173" title="Emanuel Swedenborg">
<text>Emanuel Swedenborg (, ; born Emanuel Swedberg; (29 January 1688 29 March 1772) was a Swedish polymath; scientist, engineer, astronomer, anatomist, Christian theologian, philosopher, and mystic. He became best known for his book on the afterlife, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1758).

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, notably on Easter Weekend, on 6 April
1744.
His experiences culminated in a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; in which he received a revelation that Jesus Christ had appointed him to write &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; to reform Christianity. According to &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot;, the Lord had opened Swedenborg&#x27;s spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell to converse with angels, demons, and other spirits and that the Last Judgment had already occurred in 1757, the year before the 1758 publication of &quot;De Nova Hierosolyma et ejus doctrina coelesti&quot; (English: &quot;Concerning the New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine&quot;).

Over the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that remained unpublished. He termed himself a &quot;Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; in &quot;True Christian Religion&quot;, which he published himself. Some followers of &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully divinely inspired. Others have regarded all Swedenborg&#x27;s theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were &quot;not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works&quot;. The New Church, also known as Swedenborgianism, is a Restorationist denomination of Christianity originally founded in 1787 and comprising several historically related Christian churches that revere Swedenborg&#x27;s writings as revelation.

== Early life ==
Swedenborg&#x27;s father, Jesper Swedberg (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family, &quot;bergsfrälse&quot; (early noble families in the mining sector), the Stjärna family, of the same patrilineal background as the noble family Stiernhielm, the earliest known patrilineal member being Olof Nilsson Stjärna of Stora Kopparberg. He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, Charles XI, with his sermons in Stockholm. Through the king&#x27;s influence, he would later become professor of theology at Uppsala University and Bishop of Skara.

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran Pietist movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with God rather than relying on sheer faith (&quot;sola fide&quot;). &quot;Sola fide&quot; is a tenet of the Lutheran Church, and Jesper was charged with being a pietist heretic. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel&#x27;s spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that angels and spirits were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.

In 1703–1709, aged 15–21, Emanuel Swedenborg lived in Erik Benzelius the Younger&#x27;s house. He completed his university course at Uppsala in 1709, and in 1710, he made his grand tour through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was a flourishing centre of scientific ideas and discoveries. He studied physics, mechanics and philosophy and read and wrote poetry. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic Olof Lagercrantz, Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed he might be destined to be a great scientist.

== Early scientific work and spiritual reflections ==
In 1715, aged 27, Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King Charles XII of Sweden in the city of Lund, in 1716. The Swedish inventor Christopher Polhem, who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg&#x27;s purpose was to persuade the king to fund an observatory in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the Swedish Board of Mines (&quot;Bergskollegium&quot;) in Stockholm.

From 1716 to 1718, aged 30, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled &quot;Daedalus Hyperboreus&quot; (&quot;The Northern Daedalus&quot;), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier.

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or &quot;tremulations&quot;.

Upon the death of Charles XII, Queen Ulrika Eleonora ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of bishops to receive that honor, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.

In 1724, he was offered the chair of mathematics at Uppsala University, but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with geometry, chemistry and metallurgy during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public. The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.

== Scientific studies and spiritual reflections in the 1730s ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of anatomy and physiology. He had the first known anticipation of the neuron concept a century before the full significance of the nerve cell was realised. He also had prescient ideas about the cerebral cortex, the hierarchical organization of the nervous system, the localization of the cerebrospinal fluid, the functions of the pituitary gland, the perivascular spaces, the foramen of Magendie, the idea of somatotopic organization, and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg&#x27;s desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the &quot;Principia&quot;, the first part of his Opera Philosophica et Mineralia, he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his nebular hypothesis. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.) Other inventions by Swedenborg include a submarine, an automatic weapon, an universal musical instrument, a system of sluices that could be used to transport boats across land and several types of water pumps, which were put into use when he was on Sweden&#x27;s Board of Mines.

In 1735, in Leipzig, he published a three-volume work, &quot;Opera philosophica et mineralis&quot; (&quot;Philosophical and Mineralogical Works&quot;) in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and metallurgy. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the smelting of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation. The same year, he also published the small manuscript &quot;De Infinito&quot; (&quot;On the Infinite&quot;) in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the soul is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances. He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as John Locke, Christian von Wolff, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Descartes and earlier thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Augustine of Hippo.

Swedenborg was a critic of slavery. He was the first prominent Swede to condemn slavery. 

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for &quot;Regnum animale&quot; (&quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, or &quot;Kingdom of Life&quot;), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.

== &quot;Journal of Dreams&quot; ==
By 1744, when he was 56, Swedenborg had traveled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the Royal Library in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as &quot;Drömboken&quot;, or &quot;Journal of Dreams&quot;.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing. The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of &quot;Regnum animale&quot;. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the Catholic concept of Purgatory, continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his &quot;Journal of Dreams&quot; was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on &quot;De cultu et amore Dei&quot;, or &quot;The Worship and Love of God&quot;. Swedenborg published the one and incomplete version in London in June 1745.

In 1745, aged 57, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: &quot;Do not eat too much!&quot;. Swedenborg hurried home, greatly frightened. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and would guide Swedenborg in what to write. That same night the spiritual world opened to him.

== Scriptural commentary and writings ==
In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension. He took up afresh his study of Hebrew and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as &quot;Arcana Cœlestia&quot; or under the Latin variant &quot;Arcana Caelestia&quot; (translated as &quot;Heavenly Arcana&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Mysteries&quot;, or &quot;Secrets of Heaven&quot; depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his &quot;magnum opus&quot; and the basis of his further theological works.

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.

His writings were filled with symbolism; Swedenborg often used stones to represent truth, snakes for evil, houses for intelligence, and cities for religious systems. He also described the appearance of heaven in great detail, as well as inhabitants from other planets.
His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands, and London. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg&#x27;s lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year and that he had witnessed it. According to &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot;, the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell. The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone&#x27;s life.

&quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word through Swedenborg.

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, &quot;is something profane&quot; and was not practised in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it. Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a vegetarian. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg&#x27;s early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century. However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and pigeon pie.

In &quot;Earths in the Universe&quot;, it is stated that he conversed with spirits from Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and the Moon, as well as spirits from planets beyond the Solar System. From the &quot;encounters&quot;, he concluded that the planets of the Solar System are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one &quot;Heaven&quot; derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: &quot;What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!&quot; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands to escape censorship by the Swedish Empire.

In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to Amsterdam to complete the publication of his last work. The book, &quot;Vera Christiana Religio&quot; (&quot;The True Christian Religion&quot;), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to Lutherans, it is the most concrete of his works.

==Later life==

In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before Christmas, he had a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him. Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29. (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg&#x27;s work.) Swedenborg&#x27;s landlord&#x27;s servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was &quot;going on holiday or to some merrymaking&quot;:

He was buried in the Swedish Church in Princes Square in Shadwell, London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to Uppsala Cathedral in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the botanist Carl Linnaeus. In 1917, the Swedish Church in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to Marylebone. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg&#x27;s transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people. He has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers. Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources which ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably Plotinus. That position was first taken by Swedish writer Martin Lamm who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915. Swedish critic and publicist Olof Lagercrantz had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg&#x27;s theological writing &quot;a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs&quot;.

Swedenborg&#x27;s approach to proving the veracity of his theological teachings was to use voluminous quotations from the Old Testament and the New Testament to demonstrate agreement with the Bible, and this is found throughout his theological writings. A Swedish Royal Council considering heresy charges against two Swedish promoters of his theological writings concluded that &quot;there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg&#x27;s writings&quot;. Victor Hugo suggested in passing, in Chapter 14 of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, that Swedenborg, in company with Blaise Pascal, had &quot;glided into insanity&quot;.

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law Erik Benzelius in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his &quot;experiences&quot; in empirical terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of correspondences. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of &quot;Regnum Animale&quot; dealing with the human soul.

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural (&quot;physical&quot;), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The spiritual realm was seen by Swedenborg and believers in the New Church as &quot;more real than the physical&quot; and as a series of divided &quot;spheres&quot; where souls are sent depending on the level of morality they achieved in the physical world or Earth. Souls navigate through the spiritual world and redeem themselves by travelling through it and reaching higher spheres, then encountering &quot;divinity&quot;. The foundations of this theory can be traced to Neoplatonism and the philosopher Plotinus in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning. Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature. There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in Stockholm, Sweden. In the high and increasing wind it spread very fast, consuming about 300 houses and making 2000 people homeless.

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in Gothenburg, about 400 km from Stockholm. He became agitated and told the party at six o&#x27;clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbour&#x27;s home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg. The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening. The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday. Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information. The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of &quot;The Swedenborg Epic&quot;. According to Swedenborg&#x27;s biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, 29 July – ten days after the fire.

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good friend, Consul Christopher Springer, &quot;one of the pillars of the church, ... a man of enviable reputation for virtue and intelligence&quot;, and that Swedenborg&#x27;s innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.)

According to Swedenborg&#x27;s followers, it seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg&#x27;s distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor, would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg&#x27;s report. They further contend that if Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history. Instead, &quot;when the news of Swedenborg&#x27;s extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused.&quot;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander. Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen Louisa Ulrika of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother Prince Augustus William of Prussia. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence: Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions. When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.

== Kant&#x27;s view ==

In 1763, Immanuel Kant, then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by accounts of Swedenborg&#x27;s psychic abilities and made inquiries to find out if they were true. He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive &quot;Arcana Cœlestia&quot; (&quot;Heavenly Arcana&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Mysteries&quot;). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote to Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg&#x27;s psychic experiences. Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg&#x27;s &quot;miraculous&quot; gift, and characterizing him as &quot;reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere&quot; and &quot;a scholar&quot;, in one of his letters to Moses Mendelssohn, and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg. Joseph Green, his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg&#x27;s home, found Swedenborg to be a &quot;sensible, pleasant and openhearted&quot; man and here again, a scholar.

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled &quot;Träume eines Geistersehers&quot; (&quot;Dreams of a Spirit-Seer&quot;) that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a &quot;spook hunter&quot; &quot;without official office or occupation&quot;. As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop &quot;ceaseless questioning&quot; and inquiries about &quot;Dreams&quot; from &quot;inquisitive&quot; persons, both known and unknown. Kant&#x27;s friend Moses Mendelssohn thought there was a &quot;joking pensiveness&quot; in &quot;Dreams&quot; that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether &quot;Dreams&quot; was meant to make &quot;metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible&quot;. In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to &quot;Dreams&quot; less-than-enthusiastically as a &quot;desultory little essay&quot;.

==Theology==

Swedenborg claimed in &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.

Swedenborg considered his theology a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology, except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to philosophy, a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it &quot;darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith&quot;.

The foundation of Swedenborg&#x27;s theology was laid down in &quot;Arcana Cœlestia&quot; (&quot;Heavenly Mysteries&quot;), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in &quot;Apocalypse Revealed&quot;.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human&#x27;s transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man&#x27;s rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg&#x27;s writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on &quot;Marriage Love&quot; (&quot;Conjugial Love&quot; in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement attributed to Jesus that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote &quot;The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage in Heaven&quot; as a detailed analysis of what he meant.

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in heaven into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom that define God and are the basis of creation. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth, charity and faith, God and the church, and husband and wife. In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the Trinity as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the early Christian church. There was, for instance, no mention in the Apostolic writings of any &quot;Son from eternity&quot;. Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord Jesus Christ, which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot;, Jesus, the Son of God, came into the world because of the spread of evil here.

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the First Council of Nicaea and the Athanasian Creed.

===&quot;Sola Fide&quot; (Faith Alone)===
&quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; rejects the concept of salvation through faith alone (), since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot;, is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the &quot;sola fide&quot; doctrine of Luther and others. He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God&#x27;s grace (), granted without any basis in a person&#x27;s actual behavior in life. &quot;Sola fide&quot; was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon.

Although the &quot;sola fide&quot; doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works (by faith alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against &quot;sola fide&quot; being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is charity. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

== Later history ==

Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church. Circa 1787, some 15 years after his death,   small reading groups were formed, mostly in England, to study his teachings. As one scholar states, &quot;The Heavenly Doctrine&quot; particularly appealed to the various dissenting groups that sprang up in the first half of the 18th century who were &quot;surfeited with revivalism and narrow-mindedness&quot; and found his optimism and comprehensive explanations appealing.

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg&#x27;s writings, including Robert Frost, Johnny Appleseed, William Blake, Jorge Luis Borges, Daniel Burnham, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Conan Doyle,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Flaxman, George Inness, Henry James Sr., Carl Jung, Immanuel Kant, Honoré de Balzac, Helen Keller, Czesław Miłosz, Joseph Smith, August Strindberg, D. T. Suzuki, W. B. Yeats, Tomislav Vlašić, and Mother Teresa. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of Södermanland, later King Carl XIII, who as the Grand Master of Swedish Freemasonry (&quot;Svenska Frimurare Orden&quot;) built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg&#x27;s day, Johan Henric Kellgren, called Swedenborg &quot;nothing but a fool&quot;. A heresy trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg&#x27;s death, various interpretations of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies. Swedenborg, with his claimed new dispensation, has been considered by some to have a mental illness.
While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg&#x27;s own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (the House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent. Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a &quot;kind and warm-hearted man&quot;, &quot;amiable in his meeting with the public&quot;, speaking &quot;easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences&quot;, with pleasant and interesting conversation. An English friend of Kant&#x27;s who visited Swedenborg at Kant&#x27;s behest described Swedenborg as a &quot;reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar&quot;. Of note here is Swedenborg&#x27;s statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and &quot;Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;The Dreams of Swedenborg&quot;, from symphonic metal band Therion&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Lemuria&quot;, talks about Swedenborg&#x27;s revelations.

Swedenborg and his spiritual philosophy are prominently featured in the 1835 Balzac novel, &quot;Seraphita&quot;.

Swedenborg&#x27;s book &quot;Heaven and its Wonders and Hell From Things Heard and Seen&quot; is a major contributor to the plot of the movie &quot;Things Heard &amp; Seen&quot;, which premiered on Netflix in 2021.

In Olga Tokarczuk&#x27;s 2018 novel, &quot;Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead&quot;, the main character, Janina Duszejko, makes a reference to Swedenborg&#x27;s work in astrology.

* William White, &quot;Emmanuel Swedenborg, His Life and Writings&quot;, 2nd Ed., Rev. (xx, 767 p.; London, Simpkin, Marshall, and Co., 1868) – This is the second of White&#x27;s two biographies of Swedenborg, the first one published in 1856 (White, W. &quot;Swedenborg: his life and writings&quot; Bath : I. Pitman, Phonetic Institution, 1856) and this second one in 1867. White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg. However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society&#x27;s store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society&#x27;s function. White&#x27;s response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel&#x27;s words, &quot;turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions,&quot; and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings. (&quot;The Swedenborg Epic&quot; footnote # 769) (R. Tafel, &quot;Documents Concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg&quot;, Vol. 3, p. 1284. London. Swedenborg Society 1890)

<text>Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (2 May 1702 – 10 February 1782) was a German Lutheran theologian and theosopher.

==Biography==
Oetinger was born at Göppingen. He studied philosophy and Lutheran theology at Tübingen (1722-1728), and was impressed by the works of Jakob Böhme, and also devoted attention to Leibniz and Wolff. On the completion of his university course, Oetinger spent some years travelling. In 1730 he visited Count Zinzendorf at Herrnhut, remaining there some months as teacher of Hebrew and Greek. During his travels, in his eager search for knowledge, he made the acquaintance of mystics and separatists, Christians and learned Jews, theologians and physicians alike. The Philadelphians influenced him to accept apocatastasis, the belief that all people would eventually be saved; he wove this into his theological system, depending chiefly upon I Corinthians 15 and Ephesians 1:9-11.

After some delay, he was ordained to the ministry, and held several pastorates (since 1738). While pastor (from 1746) at Walddorf near Tübingen, he studied alchemy and made many experiments, his idea being to use his knowledge for symbolic purposes. These practices exposed him to the attacks of persons who misunderstood him. “My religion,” he once said, “is the parallelism of Nature and Grace.”

Oetinger translated a part of Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s philosophy of heaven and earth, and added notes of his own. In 1760 he defended Swedenborg&#x27;s work and invited him to Germany. His treatise &quot;Swedenborg&#x27;s and other Earthly and Heavenly Philosophies&quot; was published in 1765. This and his translations of Swedenborg brought upon him the censure of his ecclesiastical superiors, but he was protected by the Duke of Württemberg, and later was appointed superintendent of the churches in the district of Weinsberg. He subsequently held the same position in Herrenberg, and afterward he became prelate at Murrhardt (appointed 1765; entered office 1766), where he died.

<text>Nokia () is a town in the Pirkanmaa region of Finland. It lies on the banks of the Nokianvirta, a river of the Kokemäki River watershed, and is situated in the Tampere metropolitan area, about west of Tampere proper. The population of Nokia is approximately , while the Tampere metropolitan area has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the second largest in the Pirkanmaa region after Tampere.

Nokia&#x27;s neighbouring municipalities are Hämeenkyrö, Pirkkala, Sastamala, Tampere, Vesilahti and Ylöjärvi. The distance to Tampere Airport from Nokia is by road around Lake Pyhäjärvi.

==Etymology and heraldry==
The origin of the name &quot;Nokia&quot; is obscure. In modern Finnish, means soot, and is an inflected plural, although this form of the word is rarely, if ever, used. The most common theory claims the name actually originates from the archaic Finnish word (pl. ) or (&quot;soot marten&quot;), meaning sable. After the sable was hunted to extinction in Finland, the word was applied to any dark-coated fur animal, such as the marten, which are found in the area to this day. The sable is enshrined on the Nokia coat of arms. However, later research has appeared to indicate that sables never inhabited Finland in the first place, and the name may actually refer to the beaver. The coat of arms was designed by Gustaf von Numers and was confirmed on October 25, 1951.

==History==
The first literary reference to Nokia is in a 1505 document, which mentions two farms &quot;Stoora och Lilla Nokia&quot;, Swedish for &quot;Big and Little Nokia&quot;. The Nokia manor was formed out of these two farms. The area was a part of the Pirkkala parish.

Nokia was the setting of one of the largest battles in the Club War, a 1596–1597 peasant uprising against feudal lords in Finland, which was then part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The peasants, armed with clubs, took up residence in Nokia Manor and won several skirmishes against the feudal cavalry, but were decisively defeated by Klaus Fleming on 1–2 January 1597. Thousands of clubmen were slain and their leader Jaakko Ilkka, who had fled, was captured a few weeks later and executed. The Club War was the last major peasant revolt in Finland, and it permanently consolidated the hold of the nation-state. Much later, in the Finnish Civil War (1918), Nokia (along with neighbouring Tampere) was a stronghold for the Red Guards and saw some combat.

In 1922, Suur-Pirkkala was split into Pohjois- and Etelä-Pirkkala (Northern and Southern). Nokia used to reach out to the current heart of Tampere, as the Pispala area was part of Nokia (Pohjois-Pirkkala) until 1937. In 1938 Pohjois-Pirkkala was renamed Nokia while Etelä-Pirkkala became simply Pirkkala. Two municipalities have been consolidated with Nokia: Suoniemi in 1973 and Tottijärvi in 1976. Nokia was designated as a city in 1977. 

===Industrial history===

The early predecessor of eponymous telecommunications giant Nokia was (de facto) born when mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established his second groundwood pulp mill on the banks of Nokianvirta river near the town of Nokia in 1868 and his enterprises were named as Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Ltd) in 1871. 
Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd) set up a factory in Nokia in 1904. These two companies and Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy (Finnish Cable Works Ltd) amalgamated in 1967 forming Nokia Corporation. Different branches of this conglomerate were split into several companies or sold off between 1988 and 1996. The rubber works still operate in Nokia as Nokian Tyres and originally in 1880 established paper mill as Essity.

Despite the Nokia Corporation having its early roots in Nokia it no longer has any operations in the city. 
Telecommunications business get started in the early 1960s as an electronics division of Finnish Cable Works Ltd (later Nokia Cable Ltd) in Helsinki and later also main office were moved to Capital Region. At this time the headquarters are situated in Espoo.
The only current presence of the company in the city is the Nokia mansion, which is sometimes used for private parties for the company&#x27;s executive staff. 
The city has repeatedly been asked to commemorate the company it gave birth to, but it has always declined, on the grounds that mobile phones were never produced there. 

Nokia does have SoC R&amp;D unit away in nearby city of Tampere.

==Present==

Today&#x27;s Nokia is famous for its spa, factory shops, waterways, and events. Nokia also enjoys good road and air connections. The largest companies are AGCO Power, Nokian Tyres, Purso, Patria Aviation and Essity paper mill. From a religious perspective, Nokia is best known for the charismatic Nokia Revival which began in 1990. Nokia is also known for its own fast food cuisine, Kuuma koira and as a home town of Nokian Brewery. Due to the closeness of Tampere studio facilities, Nokia has been also used as a filming location. For example, Eric Sykes&#x27; &quot;The Big Freeze&quot; and Finnish TV production Korpelan Kujanjuoksu

<text>James John Garth Wilkinson (3 June 1812 – 18 October 1899), was an English homeopathic physician, social reformer, translator and editor of Swedenborg&#x27;s works, and a writer on Swedenborgian topics.

==Life==
The son of James John Wilkinson (died 1845), a writer on mercantile law and judge of the County Palatine of Durham, he was born in London. Wilkinson studied medicine and worked at Newcastle Infirmary and Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He was a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1834. He became an independent medical practitioner at Store Street, Bedford Square in 1835. However, he became disillusioned with orthodox medicine and later took up homeopathy.

Attracted by the works of William Blake, he studied the &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;. He was also inspired by Emanuel Swedenborg, to the elucidation of whose writings he devoted much of his life.

He died at Finchley Road, South Hampstead, where he had lived for nearly fifty years. He was commemorated by a bust and portrait in the rooms of the Swedenborgian Society in Bloomsbury Street, London.

==Works==
Between 1840 and 1850 he edited Swedenborg&#x27;s treatises on &quot;The Doctrine of Charity&quot;, &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Outlines of a Philosophic Argument on the Infinite&quot;, and &quot;Hieroglyphic Key to Natural and Spiritual Mysteries&quot;.

Wilkinson&#x27;s preliminary discourses to these translations and his criticisms of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s comments on Swedenborg displayed an aptitude not only for mystical research, but also for original philosophic debate. The vigour of his thought won admiration from Henry James, Sr. (father of the novelist) and from Ralph Waldo Emerson, through whom he met Thomas Carlyle and James Anthony Froude; and his speculation further attracted Alfred Tennyson, the Oliphants and Edward Maitland.

He wrote a sketch of Swedenborg for the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot;, and a standard biography, &quot;Emanuel Swedenborg&quot; (1849); but these were not his only interests. He was a traveller, a linguist, well versed in Scandinavian literature and philology, the author of mystical poems entitled &quot;Improvisations from the Spirit&quot; (1857), a social and medical reformer, a convinced opponent of vaccination and vivisection. Wilkinson was a vegetarian.

Wilkinson criticized vivisection as unethical and unnecessary cruelty inflicted on animals in his book &quot;On Human Science: Good and Evil, and on Divine Revelation&quot;, published in 1876. He was an advocate of nature conservation and women&#x27;s rights.

==Anti-vaccination==

Wilkinson was an anti-vaccinationist. He contributed to &quot;The Vaccination Inquirer&quot; and completed a series of &quot;Vaccination Tracts&quot; in 1879.

==Legacy==

Henry James, Sr. became a Swedenborgian, and named a son after Wilkinson: Garth Wilkinson James, also known as Wilkie James, an officer of the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry under Robert Gould Shaw.

==Selected publications==

*&quot;Emanuel Swedenborg: A Biography&quot; (1849)
*&quot;The Human Body and its Connexion With Man&quot; (1851)
*&quot;The Homoeopathic Principle Applied to Insanity&quot; (1857)
*&quot;On Human Science: Good and Evil, and on Divine Revelation&quot; (1876)

<text>The Bodensee–Toggenburg railway is a mainly single-track standard-gauge line connecting on Lake Constance (&quot;Bodensee&quot; in German) and the Toggenburg region in Eastern Switzerland. It was built by the Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn (BT), a former railway company, which existed from 1910 until its merger with the &quot;old&quot; Südostbahn (SOB) to form the &quot;new&quot; Südostbahn (SOB) on 1 January 2001. Today, the line together with the Wattwil–Ebnat-Kappel section forms the eastern network of the Südostbahn.

The BT consisted of the standard gauge adhesion railway from Romanshorn to St. Gallen St. Fiden (19.13 km) opened on 3 October 1910 and the standard gauge adhesion line from to Wattwil (31.74 km), as well as the line from Ebnat-Kappel to Nesslau-Neu St. Johann (7.85 km) opened on 1 October 1912.

The connecting sections of line from St. Gallen St. Fiden to St. Gallen HB and from Wattwil to Ebnat-Kappel were controlled by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), as it leased the Wattwil–Ebnat-Kappel section from the BT.

== History==
The first railway lines in Eastern Switzerland followed the river valleys and thus resulted in some large detours to the east for travel to the canton capital of St. Gallen. After the construction of the St. Gallen Winkeln–Herisau railway by the &quot;Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Localbahnen&quot;, (later called the Appenzeller Bahn—Appenzell Railway; AB—and now part of the Appenzell Railways) had shown that it was possible to build railways at relatively low costs in the hilly terrain of the Alpine foothills, a large number of projects emerged in the Alpine foothills between Lake Constance and Lake Zürich. Some of the projects provided for lines connecting with the Appenzell Railway, other projects were developed independently of the AB. A narrow-gauge line through the Ricken and Wasserfluh passes would have meant a winding, slow connection. A standard gauge railway was therefore required for the important intra-cantonal connection between Rapperswil and St. Gallen. In particular, the &quot;ennet dem Ricken&quot; (&quot;beyond the Ricken&quot; in Swiss German) group built political pressure in favour of the project.

As a result, the St. Gallen Grand Council agreed on 17 May 1887 to a request for a government loan of Swiss francs (CHF) 7000 for preparatory work for a rail link from the Linth area via the Toggenburg to St. Gallen. The first expert opinion recommended a gap between Ebnat and Uznach, but this would still have required a detour via Wil to reach St. Gallen. An initiative committee (&quot;Initiativkomitee&quot;) for a St. Gallen–Herisau–Degersheim–Neckertal–Wattwil–Rapperwil railway link was formed in Degersheim in 1889. The leader was the Degersheim embroidery manufacturer Isidor Grauer-Frey, who also campaigned for an extension of the line beyond Rapperswil to Zug in order to make a connection to the Gotthard Railway. The maximum grade of 5.0% planned for the Zürichsee–Gotthardbahn—the later Schweizerische Südostbahn (SOB)—seemed to him unsuitable for main-line traffic. In 1889, the Grand Council granted the initiative committee a contribution of CHF 5,000 to submit an application for a concession for a St. Gallen–Zug railway. This concession was granted by the Federal Assembly on 27 June 1890.

There were still 15 years of disputes over the route ahead, with Grauer-Frey always vehemently opposed to local requests to use the line to promote local development. He was not able to determine all aspects of the route, but it was still possible to plan a relatively direct St. Gallen–Rapperswil route that met the standards of a main line. In addition, it proved possible to meet the goal of not exceeding a maximum grade of 1.8% as it was decided that climbing the Ricken pass would be avoided by building a base tunnel under the Ricken instead.

The project approved difficult to finance. After lengthy negotiations, the federation agreed—after it had been decided to buy and nationalise the large private railways in 1898—that the federal railway company would build the Ricken Railway if the canton of St. Gallen acquired the Wil–Ebnat-Kappel railway (&quot;Toggenburgerbahn&quot;) and handed it over to the new company. Contracts were concluded in 1901 with the soon to be nationalised United Swiss Railways (&quot;Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen&quot;; VSB). The Federal Assembly approved this deal on 19 December 1901 and transferred the Wattwil–Rapperswil line to the VSB on 20 December 1901.

Grauer-Frey&#x27;s vision of a continuation of the line from Rapperswil to Zug remained unfulfilled and the concession expired after the Federal Assembly rejected a further extension of time on 22 December 1906. Nearly 90 years later, this dream re-emerged for a short time with a proposal for a &quot;Hirzel Tunnel&quot; under the New Railway Link through the Alps project. In contrast, the St. Gallen–Romanshorn and the Ebnat–Nesslau Neu St. Johann projects, which were promoted by other initiators, were combined with the St. Gallen–Wattwil line into a single concession (Federal Decrees of 19 December 1902 and 11 April 1907).

=== St. Gallen–Romanshorn and the extension to Obertoggenburg ===
A project was proposed for a metre-gauge interurban tramway on the St. Gallen–Wittenbach–Kügeliswinden–Neukirch–Amriswil route in 1889. Arbon also sought the construction of a narrow-gauge railway to St. Gallen via Roggwil. The St. Gallen municipal council however, wanted a standard gauge railway to the port of Romanshorn, which served the Lake Constance train ferries. At that time, Romanshorn was an important hub for freight traffic between Switzerland and Germany because the Basel Rhine ports did not start operating until 1922. Coal, iron and other goods were carried from Romanshorn to St. Gallen via Rorschach.

The line was opposed vigorously. The original project envisaged a 980 metre-long tunnel through the Rosenberg ridge from . The line would then run along the Sitter river to the village of Wittenbach. It was then decided to share the SBB line from St. Gallen to St. Finden and the SBB built the double-track Rosenberg Tunnel in place of the single-track surface line through the city that had been built in 1856. Large civil engineering structures were not required, with the exception of the Bruggwald Tunnel. The Federal Assembly granted the concession for the line on 15 April 1898.

When the project of the Bodensee–Toggenburg Railway became known publicly, every village in the St. Gallen-Thurgau border area sought the best possible access from the railway line. A station serving the Muolen-Steinebrunn community was not approved by the population and had to be dropped. The original proposal envisaged an Egnach station before the junction with the Lake Line (&quot;Seelinie&quot;). Egnach wanted its own connection to the BT even though it already had a station on the Lake Line. Finally Neukirch and Egnach agreed to have a common station with a corresponding double name.

The branch line from Wil to Ebnat of the Toggenburg Railway had been opened in 1870. In 1890, the St. Gallen Executive Council added an extension from Ebnat to Nesslau to the project. The Federal Assembly granted the concession on 17 June 1898. With a change in the statutes, the Ebnat-Kappel–Nesslau Neu St. Johann line became part of the Bodensee–Toggenburg railway on 6 February 1909. Shortly before the start of construction, alternative projects for narrow-gauge tramways appeared. A plan for a railway from Ebnat to Unterwasser was presented in 1907 and another plan for a railway from Wattwil to Buchs was presented in 1908. Because the BT already had the concession to Nesslau, the Federal Assembly granted a concession for a narrow-gauge railway from Nesslau only as far as Buchs on 24 June 1910.

=== Construction ===

The new Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) began the construction of the Ricken Tunnel between Wattwil and Kaltbrunn on 17 November 1903. The breakthrough took place, after delays caused by firedamp, on 30 March 1908.

The first preparatory work for the construction of the Wasserfluh Tunnel was started in Lichtensteig on 27 December 1905, beginning with the construction of the BT. The first works on the 99 metre-high Sitter Viaduct did not start until the summer of 1908. The construction workers coming from Italy and Croatia were often ignorant of the German language and tensions arose between the population and the workers.

The BT had to contend with countless difficulties in its construction, so that the opening, which had been planned for the spring of 1910, had to be postponed for half a year. The BT had serious disputes with the Appenzeller Bahn (AB), as its line to St. Gallen competed with part of the BT line. Its station near the village of Herisau had to be relocated at the expense of BT. The SBB refused the BT the use of platform 1 in , which made the construction of a bridge over the SBB line from Bruggen necessary.

Part of the Bruggwald Tunnel collapsed during construction on 22 June 1909, resulting in seven casualties and a strike. The company commissioned to construct the Wasserfluh Tunnel was affected by two work stoppages and financial difficulties. The BT cancelled the contract and finished the tunnel under its own direction; seven people were killed during this work. Heavy and prolonged rainfall resulted in dozens of landslides, the repair of which caused much effort and expense. One side of the Hohenbühl embankment at Roggwil-Berg slipped only a few weeks before the line was opened.

=== Opening===
The Romanshorn–St. Gallen St. Fiden and the St. Gallen–Wattwil lines were opened together with the Ricken Railway between Wattwil and Uznach on 1 October 1910. The first train consisted of rolling stock from BT and SBB. Scheduled traffic started on 3 October 1910.
The extension of the Toggenburg line from Ebnat-Kappel to Nesslau was finally opened on 30 September 1912. Operations commenced on the 7.6 km-long line on 1 October 1912. It overcomes a height difference of 119 metres. It required three tunnels and several bridges.

=== Station buildings===
The BT did not build the station buildings as standardised types, but like the Rhaetian Railway, it built station that were intended to reflect building types found in the area. The BT station buildings and the joint station in Lichtensteig were built according to drafts by the St. Gallen architect Salomon Schlatter.

The station buildings in Wittenbach, Häggenschwil, Muolen and Steinebrunn are based on Thurgau half-timbered houses. The buildings in Wittenbach and Steinebrunn are characterised by Mansard roofs and coupled windows, while in Häggenschwil and Muolen there are evenly distributed windows with shutters. Mogelsberg and Brunnadern received stations modelled on a Toggenburg farm house (a variety of Swiss chalet) with a timber-frame extension. Schachen in the Appenzell region had a station with a wood shingle screen that is typical of that region.

The stations buildings of Roggwil-Berg and Neukirch-Egnach show similarities with the country houses that the wealthy of St. Galler and Konstanz built in the 18th century. The larger stations of Haggen, Herisau and Degersheim resemble the factory buildings of the area.
=== Operations of the SBB ===

The BT had procured its own rolling stock, but entered a contract with the SBB for its operation, because it hoped for financial savings as a result. However, a review in 1915 showed that handling its own operations would have lower costs. Negotiations with the SBB soon led to an agreement with the SBB proposing to maintain the continuous operations between Romanshorn and Rapperswil and between Wil and Nesslau and to use the rolling stock and personnel of the two railways in natural proportions. The BT took over its own operation on 1 May 1917. The necessary facilities for vehicle maintenance were built in Herisau for this purpose.

=== Extension to the Rhine Valley ===
The opening of the postal bus route from Nesslau to Wildhaus on 1 May 1918 led to a significant increase in traffic on the railway line to Nesslau.

As soon as the First World War was over, a project was developed to build an electric metre-gauge railway on the Nesslau-Wildhaus-Buchs SG route called the &quot;Toggenburg-Werdenberg-Bahn&quot; (Toggenburg-Werdenberg Railway; TWB). With a 6.5% grade and curves with a minimum radius of 60 to 70 metres, the western end of the line would not have caused much difficulty. The summit was planned at Wildhaus, right in the middle of the 32 kilometre-long route. The route down the eastern ramp from Wildhaus via Gamserberg to Gams would have passed through a spiral tunnel. The Gams–Buchs line would have been built as a tramway. The costs were estimated at a remarkably low CHF 9.5 million.

The BT submitted an application for a 15.1-kilometre extension of its line to Wildhaus in 1944. The maximum slope would have been 5.0%. In addition to four tunnels, stations were planned in Stein, Alt St. Johann, Unterwasser and Wildhaus. The project, which was intended as a work-creation measure, was not realised because there was very low unemployment after the war.

===Railmotor operations===

In 1926 two BCFm 2/4 petrol-powered railmotors were delivered to the BT, which allowed a reduction in the operating costs of some local trains and the operation of additional trains. Since the concept of &quot;light operation&quot; proved to be successful, not only locomotives, but also railcars were procured for the electrification of the line. The engines were removed from two petrol railmotors and they were converted into railcar trailers. The fact that they were not kept as a reserve for independent operations over unelectrified lines, such as the diesel railcar of the Appenzeller Bahn, suggests that their petrol engines were not completely satisfactory.

=== Electrification ===
Electrification was already an issue during the construction of the line, but the SBB opposed it. From a technical point of view, there was still a great deal of uncertainty and no cost savings compared to steam operation. The First World War, which caused coal prices to rise, changed this view quickly. On 18 October 1920, BT&#x27;s board of directors decided to electrify the St. Gallen–Wattwil–Nesslau line, but it rescinded this decision a year later, after coal prices had quickly returned to normal.

On 4 October 1926, there was an accident in the Ricken Tunnel (carbon monoxide poisoning of the train crew of a stopped freight train), which forced the SBB to electrify the tunnel immediately.

As a result, continuous steam operation to Rapperswil was not possible from 15 May 1927, so the board of directors of BT decided to fully electrify the BT lines on 12 April 1930. The Confederation and the cantons (with the involvement of the municipalities) granted the BT an electrification loan of CHF 3.9 million. In order to ensure continuous electrification, BT had to lease the Wattwil–Ebnat-Kappel line from the SBB because the latter did not intend to electrify the Toggenburg Railway in the foreseeable future—although the line was electrified during the Second World War.

The St. Gallen–Nesslau line has been operated electrically since 4 October 1931 and the Romanshorn–St. Gallen line since 24 January 1932.

=== Cooperation with the SOB ===
With the commencement of the electric operation on the Südostbahn (SOB) in 1939, new possibilities for cooperation opened up. In 1940, direct trains were introduced between St. Gallen and some of which were extended to on Sundays from 1945 and then daily from 1947. Thus the &quot;Direkte Linie Nordostschweiz–Zentralschweiz&quot; (north-east Switzerland–central Switzerland direct line) was created, which is now marketed as the Voralpen Express.

At the start of electrical operations, the SOB locomotives had not been delivered, so initially, both the BT and the SBB assisted with locomotives and railcars.

The idea to merge train operations and workshops was considered for the first time in 1955. The project failed, however, and the close cooperation in offering through trains found no equivalent in other areas of operations.

=== Development of the modern private railway ===
Apart from electrification, the condition of BT changed little during the first forty years. The highly-engineered lines in the foothills of the Alps created a debt burden and interest charges that were an enormous burden for the company. In the 1930s, the financial situation deteriorated so much that a partial renovation of the line was necessary in 1942/43 at the expense of the Federation and the cantons of St. Gallen and Thurgau. It was not until a new Railways Act was passed by the federal government in 1958 that the way was clear for the comprehensive renewal of the infrastructure and rolling stock fleet.

The BT equipped its lines with automatic block signaling between 1954 and 1956. It used its proprietary &quot;Teleblock&quot; system, which was cheaper than the usual systems thanks to the use of telephone relays. For its fiftieth anniversary, BT was able to commission push–pull operations with BDe 4/4 set No. 50. This train was equipped with fluorescent tube lighting, rubber-covered gangway connections and a built-in end-of-train device. Two BDe 2/4 + ABt local push–pull trains were built in its own workshop and put into operation in 1961 and 1965.

With its first investment program, the rolling stock fleet was expanded in 1966–68 with three other BDe 4/4 push–pull trains and twelve &quot;Einheitswagen I&quot; (Swiss &quot;unity coach 1&quot;, built between 1956 and 1967) and the mechanical signal boxes were replaced by relay interlockings. A second stage included the upgrade of the entire infrastructure. The focus of the upgrade of the Wittenbach–St.Gallen–Herisau–Degersheim section in 1973–1982 was to create a modern suburban line with customer-friendly station facilities. In a third stage, in 1984, six three-coach phase-controlled push–pull trains RBDe 4/4 + B + ABt were procured, which were used in regional transport. The fourth investment program enabled the purchase of six Re 4/4 locomotives in 1987/88, These were the world&#x27;s first frequency changer locomotives with three-phase asynchronous motors and gate turn-off thyristors. The first section of double track was opened in Gübsensee in 1989, allowing half-hourly services between St. Gallen and Wattwil.

=== The “end” of the BT ===
Under new leadership and in a changed political environment in the 1990s, talks began again on closer cooperation between the BT and the SOB. A retroactive merger was agreed to form a new Schweizerischen Südostbahn based in St. Gallen to take effect retroactively on 1 January 2001.

With the exception of the Lötschberg railway of the BLS, BT had the largest number of engineering structures per kilometre of its owned line of any Swiss railway company. The large number of tunnels and bridges led to high construction and maintenance costs.

== Construction==
=== Tunnels ===
BT&#x27;s lines included 17 tunnels with a total length of 6.927 km, of which the Bruggwald and the Wasserfluh Tunnels were more than 1 km long. Thus, 12.45% of the property length was underground.

=== Bridges ===

BT&#x27;s lines had 85 bridges over 2 metres in length (of which 16 are more than 60 metres in length) with a total length of 3.150 km. 5.66% of its property ownership consisted of bridge sections. In addition, the BT had the highest railway bridge in Switzerland, the 99 metre-high Sitter Viaduct. The brick structure with a 120 metre-long half-timbered central section was also the longest bridge of the BT.

Bridges over 40 m long:
== Operations==
=== Operation by the Bodensee-Toggenburg-Bahn ===

Because the BT&#x27;s line basically consisted only of sections with connections that belonged to the SBB, personnel and rolling stock were always deployed across company boundaries. This was always with track access charges calculated on the basis of kilometres of track used, initially only in relation to the SBB, later with the establishment of the operation of the &quot;direct line&quot; in central Switzerland also in relation to the SOB.

A special feature is the double track between Lichtensteig and Wattwil. The western track formerly belonged to the SBB and the eastern track to the BT. Operationally, it was not a conventional double track line until 2006, but two adjacent single tracks. Trains could not run on the other track until the installation of a signal box and an adjustment of the tracks in 1977/78 (although traffic to/from Herisau only runs on track 2). Operation on the alternative track is used especially in the case of delays. Previously only the mountain-side (western) track could be used for D4 traffic (22.5 t axle load, 8.0 t/m linear load) and the other track could only be used for C3 traffic (20.0 t axle load, 7.2 t/m linear load). Since 2018 both tracks can be used for D4 traffic.

The BT had no less than seven joint stations.
* (SBB)
* (SBB)
* (SBB, TB, SGA/AB)
* Herisau (AB)
* Lichtensteig (SBB)
* Wattwil (SBB)
* Ebnat-Kappel (SBB, until 1931)

Under the SOB, the ownership of the assets of the former BT was adjusted between the SBB and the SOB during 2006 and responsibility for the operation of the Lichtensteig–Wattwil–Ebnat-Kappel section has belonged to the SOB since then. Specifically, the SBB have transferred its shares in these assets to the SOB in exchange for the former BT’s shares in St. Gallen station.

=== Operations by the Südostbahn ===

The line of the Bodensee-Toggenburg Railway company is now operated as part of the St. Gallen S-Bahn. The fastest service is the hourly Voralpen-Express (VAE) of the SOB from St.Gallen via Rapperswil to Lucerne and the RegioExpress from St.Gallen via Romanshorn and Konstanz to Kreuzlingen, which Thurbo operates every two hours. The whole line from Nesslau to Romanshorn is served by line S8, operated by Thurbo, which extends from Romanshorn to . These services are supplemented by the S4 circular line (St. Gallen–Uznach–Sargans–St. Gallen) of the SOB. The S81 service (Herisau–Wittenbach) operates only in the peak hours.

The Südostbahn wants to reduce journey times from Wattwil to Nesslau to under half an hour in order to be able to run half-hourly rather than hourly services. Therefore the line will be upgraded as far as possible for higher speeds in 2019. Between Wattwil and Ebnat-Kappel trains will be able to run at 140 km/h. The exit speed from Wattwil station will be increased around 2021. The reversal of the service in Nesslau has been carried out automatically without intervention by a driver since 2017.

Important freight traffic consists of block trains to the Häggenschwil-Winden tank farm and freight trains to serve a private railway siding in St. Gallen Haggen.

<text>The Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon-Bahn (BLS), known between 1997 and 2006 as the BLS Lötschbergbahn, was a Swiss railway company. In 2006 the company merged with Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG to form a new company called BLS AG.

BLS owned the largest standard gauge network on the Swiss Railway system apart from the Swiss Federal Railways. The railway had not been built at the time that the Federal government took control of the five big Swiss standard gauge railway companies in 1902 and so it led a separate existence, being considered the largest of the Swiss &quot;private&quot; railways, although the majority of its capital was owned by the cantonal government of Bern, with the Confederation holding about one fifth.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

With the opening of the Gotthard line in 1882 the canton of Bern became separated from the main north–south route. The administration, not being happy with the situation, made full use of its federal rights to build its own line but it could not rely on financial aid from the Swiss Confederation, the authorities being vehemently opposed to any rival transit route. Bern had to look elsewhere to raise the necessary funds and these were to come from an unexpected source. In 1871, due to the Franco-Prussian War, France had surrendered Alsace-Lorraine to Germany. As part of this annexation, the French-Swiss border crossing at Basel was lost.

Because of this, business circles in Paris were interested in co-financing a viable international transit route through Switzerland. Several alternative routes via Frutigen–Lötschberg were proposed but eventually, the Pro-Lötschberg Initiative Committee won the day. The Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon-Bahn was founded on 27 July 1906 and within a few months construction work commenced.

=== The Lötschberg tunnel ===

Possibly because of French finance the construction of the &quot;Mountain Route&quot; the 58 km Frutigen–Brig line, was assigned to a French construction consortium, the major civil engineering work on the section being single-track Lötschberg Tunnel. Construction began on 15 October 1906 but within months the Swiss federal authorities ordered the BLS to enlarge the tunnel to double track and to profile its access ramps to suit. Money was not forthcoming for the provision of a double track line throughout and only the Lötschberg Tunnel itself was constructed in this way. Due to an accident on 24 July 1908 in which rock, washed with alpine waters, collapsed into the tunnel gallery killing 25 Italian miners, construction work was halted for six months before the gallery was sealed and plans made to bypass the site. The plan was to construct three curves inside the mountain and extending the length of the tunnel to . The breakthrough was finally made on 31 March 1911.
With the completion of the access ramps, the other civil engineering works on the line, 33 tunnels, 3 avalanche galleries and 22 bridges, together with the provision of electrical support masts, power stations, sub-stations, etc., the line, powered at 15,000 volts, alternating current, 16⅔ Hz was officially opened on 19 June 1913.

=== Take overs and wartime changes ===

In 1913 the BLS made a successful takeover of the Lake Thun railway (TSB) (Thun/Scherzligen–Interlaken–Bönigen), and became the operating company for three other companies in the area, the Bern–Neuchâtel railway (BN), the Gürbetal–Bern–Schwarzenburg railway (GBS) and the Spiez–Erlenbach-Zweisimmen railway (SEZ) adding some to its system. The BLS/TSB merger meant that the Lötschbergbahn also became the proprietor of the shipping company on Lake Thun and Lake Brienz.

In 1915, to shorten the distance through the Jura Mountains, to the French border, the company inaugurated the Grenchenberg line between Moutier and Lengnau, which included the Grenchenberg Tunnel.

Following World War I, in 1919, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France under the Treaty of Versailles, and Basel was restored as a border crossing between France and Switzerland. As a consequence, the importance of Delle as a border crossing point into France became less. Transit traffic was more and more routed via Basel/Saint-Louis. Freight traffic between Germany and Italy, which could be routed via the Lötschberg line meant that the company was able to offset the loss of transit via Delle.

=== Double-track and piggyback ===
Problems with the operation of a single line railway were being seriously felt in the 1960s, but it was not until 1976 that the Federal Council gave their approval to loan of CHF 620,000,000 to upgrade the line to double track, the work to be carried in several stages, commencing the following year. The line, entirely double-track, was officially inaugurated on 8 May 1992.

At the end of 1993, the Swiss Confederation commissioned the BLS to provide a &quot;piggyback&quot; corridor along its line for road vehicles with a width of and a corner height of . The construction work began in January 1994 and the opening was delayed, due to geological problems on the southern side of the Simplon, until 11 June 2001. Since opening, the &quot;rolling highway&quot;, the transportation of trucks by rail from Germany to Italy via Lötschberg, has made a considerable contribution towards transferring transit traffic from road to rail.

In 1994 the BLS moved 9.2 million passengers.

=== Politics and railways ===
The economic, political and legal operating environment for European railways changed to such an extent towards the end of the 20th century that restructuring amongst railway operators became inevitable. Liberalisation and competition also started to make an impact on railways. (Using EU legislation Britain&#x27;s railway network can probably show best and worst what happened with its divisions and fragmentation). Although not bound by EU directives Switzerland is surrounded by EU countries and as details arrived from Brussels notice was taken of happenings elsewhere. The BLS Lötschbergbahn reacted early and realigned itself strategically. On 1 January 1997, the jointly-operated BN, GBS and SEZ railways merged with BLS to form BLS Lötschbergbahn AG. The organisation was also changed, the company being now based around the three profit-focused core business of infrastructure, passenger traffic and cargo.

On 15 May 2001, in order to secure their future, the BLS and SBB agreed on a new task-sharing arrangement. This was largely implemented as part of the timetable changes made on 12 December 2004 when the BLS took over the running of the SBB&#x27;s S-Bahn lines and with it, system responsibility for Bern&#x27;s S-Bahn network, the second largest in the country. This was accompanied by the transfer of long-distance railway operations from the BLS to the SBB. Within the cargo sector the SBB assumed overall control for full-load traffic in Switzerland. Transit and block train traffic has been subject to competition since the signing of the 2001 agreement. The SBB became responsible for rail network management across Switzerland.

On 27 September 1992, the Swiss people voted with an overwhelming majority in favour of the NRLA project. In voting &quot;Yes&quot; the Swiss people gave their approval for the construction of two transverse routes through the Alps, one at the Gotthard, the other at the Lötschberg. The original NRLA Lötschberg project provided for two single bore tunnels between Frutigen and the Rhône valley, a distance of . For financial reasons the tunnel length was shortened to , and the greater part of one of the bores was only constructed as a shell. 
The new base line was inaugurated on 15 June 2007 and full standard traffic started with the new timetable on 9 December 2007. In full operation trains are able to travel through the Lötschberg Base Tunnel at speeds of . Since the completion of NRLA and the opening of the new Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the BLS is responsible for the operation of train services along the entire Lötschberg–Simplon route.

=== Creation of BLS AG ===

In June 2006, following their respective Annual General Meetings and with the approval of the shareholders, the &quot;Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG&quot; and the &quot;BLS Lötschbergbahn AG&quot; were merged to form BLS AG. The new undertaking belongs to the canton of Bern (55.8%), the Swiss Confederation (21.7%), and further cantons and private persons (22.5%). The BLS AG was actually founded on 24 April 2006, when the cantons of Bern, Lucerne, Solothurn, Valais, and Neuchâtel exchanged their BLS and RM shares for BLS AG ones.

As a result of the fusion of the companies, the BLS AG became the second-biggest operation on Swiss standard-gauge railways after the Swiss Federal Railways. The BLS AG operates regional traffic in an area that lies between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Lucerne and the Jura Mountains and the Simplon Massif. It is also responsible for operating most routes of the Bern S-Bahn, together with some of those of the Lucerne S-Bahn.

== Route ==
The directly owned main line of the Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon-Bahn ran from Thun, where it connected with the Swiss Federal Railways through Spiez and the Lötschberg Tunnel to Brig, where it connects with the Swiss Federal Railways owned Simplon Tunnel to Italy. The route between Thun and Spiez formed part of Lake Thun line, which also serves a terminus at Interlaken, whilst from Spiez to Brig the Lötschberg line was used.

This classic main line formed part of a longer route, from the border with France and Germany through the Simplon Tunnel to the border with Italy and Milan. As part of one variant of this route, the BLS also owned and built the Grenchenberg line between Moutier and Lengnau, which included the Grenchenberg tunnel, and shortened the distance between the French border at Delle and Bern. However most of this longer route was always operated by other railway companies.

Besides the lines mentioned above, the BLS also operated several other independently owned operating companies in the canton of Bern, including the Bern–Neuchâtel railway (BN), the Gürbetal–Bern–Schwarzenburg railway (GBS) and the Spiez–Erlenbach-Zweisimmen railway (SEZ). In 1997, the ownership of these lines was taken over by the BLS.

Between 2004 and 2006, when it was subsumed into the BLS AG, the company also operated extensive commuter services as part of the Bern S-Bahn network. The BLS network operated trains over of standard gauge track, but the BLS actually owned only . The whole network was electrified at 15 kV 16⅔ Hz.

== Locomotives and multiple units ==
The Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon-Bahn operated the following locomotives and multiple units.

=== Class Re 4/4 (Re 425) ===

Re 425 170–190 are fitted with ETCS and thus able to pull trains over NBS Mattstetten – Rothrist and through Lötschberg Base Tunnel. Other Re 425 could act in MU as second or third engine and, if required, also behind an Re 465.

Re 425 191–195 were fitted with Railvox public address system and thus primarily used for 
push-pull services. There are 6 driving trailers for passenger services. By December 2010 the use of such consists for additional trains of S-Bahn Bern ended. Five consists are in use around Spiez (2011).

Third field of use are the car shuttles through (old) Lötschberg Tunnel. A total of nine driving trailers is available for this purpose.

<text>Space Is the Place is an 85-minute Afrofuturist science fiction film made in 1972 and released in 1974. It was directed by John Coney, written by Sun Ra and Joshua Smith, and features Sun Ra and his Arkestra. A soundtrack was released on Evidence Records.

==Background==
During the late-1960s and early-1970s, Sun Ra and his ensemble made several forays to California. In 1971, Sun Ra taught a course, &quot;The Black Man in the Cosmos&quot;, at University of California, Berkeley. Over the course of these California visits, Sun Ra came to the attention of Jim Newman, who produced the film &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; starring Sun Ra and his Arkestra, and based, in part, on Sun Ra&#x27;s Berkeley lectures.

==Plot==
Sun Ra, who has been reported lost since his European tour in June 1969, lands on a new planet in outer space with his crew, known as &quot;the Arkestra&quot;, and decides to settle African Americans on this planet. The medium of transportation he chooses for this resettlement is music. He travels back in time and returns to the Chicago strip club where he used to play piano with the name &quot;Sonny Ray&quot; in 1943, where he confronts the Overseer (Ray Johnson), a pimp-overlord, and they agree on a game of cards for the fate of the Black race.

In present time (the early 1970s), Ra disembarks from his spaceship in Oakland and tries to spread word of his plans. He meets with young African Americans at an Oakland youth centre and opens an &quot;Outer Space Employment Agency&quot; to recruit people eager to move to the planet. He also agrees with Jimmy Fey (Christopher Brooks) — an employee of the Overseer — to arrange radio interviews, a record album, and eventually a concert that will help him dictate his message.

As the card game between Ra and the Overseer is played, and it becomes clear that the Overseer is winning, Ra&#x27;s plans to recruit local black youth for his new utopian space colony suffer setbacks. Many of them are suspicious of Ra, accusing him of faking his outer-spatial origin as a gimmick to boost his record sales. He is kidnapped by a team of white NASA scientists who threaten him with violence, desperate to learn the secrets to his space-travel technology. As Ra&#x27;s concert rapidly approaches, he is saved by three local teenagers, who escort him to the music hall just in time.

At the concert, as the Arkestra play their signature free jazz, the NASA scientists appear and attempt to assassinate Ra with a pistol. One of the teenagers jumps in front of the bullet, saving Ra&#x27;s life, and as he is bleeding out on the stage, Sun Ra waves his hand and the teenager, his friends, and Ra himself all disappear from the music hall. One by one, black people across Oakland vanish into thin air and reappear on Ra&#x27;s spaceship.

Jimmy Fey resists leaving Earth on Ra&#x27;s spaceship, but Ra doesn&#x27;t let Fey leave; Ra takes Fey&#x27;s &quot;black parts&quot; with him onto the spaceship, leaving his &quot;white parts&quot; behind on Earth. Fey, now acting white, leaves the Overseer, who loses the duel. As Ra&#x27;s spaceship launches off into the cosmos and music begins playing, a montage implies that Earth is destroyed in its wake.

==Production and release==
&quot;Space is the Place&quot; emerged from &quot;Dilexi&quot;, an &quot;experimental art series&quot; produced by Jim Newman and directed by John Coney. Wishing to build on his forays into filming avant garde music, Newman recruited Coney to film concert footage of Ra and His Arkestra; Coney then hired Seth Hill to act as cinematographer. Filming of Arkestra performance footage was followed shortly by a scant number of loosely scripted dramatic scenes. Hill was then asked to create &quot;a story to tie all the disparate elements together.&quot; To this end, Hill enlisted the help of Joshua Smith, a friend from film school whose fascination with &quot;the culture of pimps and whores&quot; would result in the blaxploitation themes underpinning those scenes in the film not involving Sun Ra. According to assistant director Tom Bullock, the &quot;seemingly death-defying existential leaps in logic and continuity&quot; that resulted from the film&#x27;s fragmented production were resolved in post-production by editor Barbara Pokras.

Two cuts exist of the film. The first, sometimes referred to as &quot;Sun Ra&#x27;s edit&quot;, is abridged to 64 minutes; for decades following its limited initial release, &quot;Space is the Place&quot; could only be found on VHS in this form. The second, uncut version runs 82 minutes, and was made available for the first time in 2003, when the film was re-released by Plexifilm. Following another lapse out of print, both cuts of &quot;Space is the Place&quot; were released together for the first time by Harte Recordings in 2015.

The film inspired The Bright Light Social Hour&#x27;s album &quot;Space Is Still the Place&quot; (2015).

== Interpretation ==
It has been suggested that &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; can be interpreted as Sun Ra&#x27;s response to the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, with whom Ra was engaged in a performative struggle for the imagery of the future of the black race. Daniel Kreiss writes:While he does not condemn the party by name, Sun Ra ultimately finds limited value in terrestrial community programs, an allusion to the Panthers, and posits that only the band&#x27;s use of technology and music will liberate the people by changing consciousness.

<doc id="224224" wikidata="Q187423" url="?curid=224224" title="Zelig">
<text>Zelig is a 1983 American satirical mockumentary comedy film written, directed by and starring Woody Allen as Leonard Zelig, a nondescript enigma, who, apparently out of his desire to fit in and be liked, unwittingly takes on the characteristics of strong personalities around him. The film, presented as a documentary, recounts his period of intense celebrity during the 1920s, including analyses by contemporary intellectuals.

The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Costume Design.

== Style ==
&quot;Zelig&quot; was photographed and narrated in the style of 1920s black-and-white newsreels, which are interwoven with archival footage from the era and re-enactments of real historical events. Color segments from the present day include interviews of real cultural figures, such as Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag, and fictional ones.

== Plot ==
Set in the 1920s and 1930s, the film concerns Leonard Zelig (Woody Allen), a nondescript man who has the ability to transform his behavior and demeanor to that of the people who surround him. He is first observed at a party by F. Scott Fitzgerald, who notes that Zelig related to the affluent guests in a refined Boston accent and shared their Republican sympathies, but while in the kitchen with the servants, he adopted a coarser tone and seemed to be more of a Democrat. He soon gains international fame as a &quot;human chameleon&quot;.

Interviewed in one of the witness shots, psychologist Bruno Bettelheim makes the following comment:

Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) is a psychiatrist who wants to help Zelig with this strange disorder when he is admitted to her hospital. Through the use of hypnotism, she discovers Zelig yearns for approval so strongly that he physically changes to fit in with those around him. Dr. Fletcher eventually cures Zelig of his compulsion to assimilate, but goes too far in the other direction; for a brief period he is so intolerant of others&#x27; opinions that he gets into a brawl over whether or not it is a nice day.

Dr. Fletcher realizes that she is falling in love with Zelig. Because of the media coverage of the case, both patient and doctor become part of the popular culture of their time. However, fame is the main cause of their division. Numerous women claim that he married and impregnated them, causing a public scandal. The same society that made Zelig a hero destroys him.

Zelig&#x27;s illness returns, and he tries to fit in once more, before he disappears. Dr. Fletcher finds him in Germany working with the Nazis before the outbreak of World War II. Together they escape, as Zelig uses his ability to imitate one more time, mimicking Fletcher&#x27;s piloting skills and flying them back home across the Atlantic upside down. They eventually return to America, where they are proclaimed heroes and marry to live full happy lives.

== Cast ==

Susan Sontag, Irving Howe, Saul Bellow, Bricktop, Dr. Bruno Bettelheim and Professor John Morton Blum appear as themselves. 

== Production ==
Allen used newsreel footage, and inserted himself and other actors into it, using bluescreen technology. To provide an authentic look to his scenes, Allen and cinematographer Gordon Willis used a variety of techniques, including locating some of the antique film cameras and lenses used during the eras depicted in the film, and simulating damage, such as crinkles and scratches, on the negatives to make the finished product look more like vintage footage. All of the production sound was recorded on antique carbon microphones. The virtually seamless blending of old and new footage was achieved almost a decade before digital filmmaking technology made such techniques much easier to accomplish, as seen in films such as &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994) and various television advertisements.

The film uses cameo appearances by real figures from academia and other fields for comic effect. Contrasting the film&#x27;s vintage black-and-white film footage, these persons appear in color segments as themselves, commenting in the present day on the Zelig phenomenon as if it really happened. They include essayist Susan Sontag, psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow, political writer Irving Howe, historian John Morton Blum, and the Paris nightclub owner Bricktop.

Also appearing in the film&#x27;s vintage footage are Charles Lindbergh, Al Capone, Clara Bow, William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, Charlie Chaplin, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Carole Lombard, Dolores del Río, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, James Cagney, Jimmy Walker, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Adolphe Menjou, Claire Windsor, Tom Mix, Marie Dressler, Bobby Jones, and Pope Pius XI. Each of these public figures were represented in newsreel footage and many were also seamlessly portrayed by look-alike actors in the film.

In the time it took to complete the film&#x27;s special effects, Allen completed &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (production started prior to the filming of Zelig) and filmed &quot;Broadway Danny Rose.&quot; This is Orion Pictures&#x27; last film to be released through Warner Bros.

== Release ==
Before being shown at the Venice Film Festival, the film opened on six screens in the US and grossed US$60,119 on its opening weekend; it eventually earned US$11.8 million in North America.

== Critical reaction ==
&quot;Zelig&quot; has a 97% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Wryly amusing, technically impressive, and ultimately thought-provoking, &quot;Zelig&quot; represents Woody Allen in complete command of his craft&quot;.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby observed:

&quot;Variety&quot; said the film was &quot;consistently funny, though more academic than boulevardier&quot;, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; called it &quot;amazingly funny and poignant&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; described it as &quot;a strong contender for Allen&#x27;s most fascinating film&quot;, while &quot;TV Guide&quot; said, &quot;Allen&#x27;s ongoing struggles with psychoanalysis and his Jewish identity – stridently literal preoccupations in most of his work – are for once rendered allegorically. The result is deeply satisfying&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four, calling it &quot;a beautifully made but slight fable.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote that when the film was over &quot;I felt good, but I was still a little hungry for a movie. There&#x27;s a reason &#x27;Zelig&#x27; seems small; there aren&#x27;t any characters in it, not even Zelig.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Zelig&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Woody Allen&#x27;s most irresistable film for quite a while. He has found a new way to make fun of his own neuroses without exposing us to the egoism which became so overbearing in &quot;Manhattan&quot; or &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;.&quot;

It ranked 588th among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made. Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the work as one of Allen&#x27;s finest, lauding it as &quot;a spot-on homage to vintage newsreels and a seamless exercise in technique.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey also named it as a career highlight and argued, &quot;The special effects, in which Allen is seamlessly inserted into vintage newsreels, are still astonishing, and draw out the aching tragicomedy of Zelig&#x27;s plight. He&#x27;s the original man who wasn&#x27;t there.&quot; Calum Marsh of &quot;Slant&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;We are infinitely pliable. That&#x27;s the thesis of &quot;Zelig&quot;, Allen&#x27;s wisest film, which has much to say about the way a person can be bent and contorted in the name of acceptance. Its ostensibly wacky conceit ... is grounded in an emotional and psychological reality all too familiar to shrug off as farce. We&#x27;ll go very far out of our way to avoid conflict. &quot;Zelig&quot; seizes on that weakness and forces us to recognize it.&quot;

<text>Renfe (, ), officially Renfe-Operadora, is Spain&#x27;s national state-owned railway company. 

It was created in 2005 upon the split of the former Spanish National Railway Network (RENFE) into the Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF), which inherited the infrastructure, and Renfe-Operadora, which inherited the railway service.

== History ==

The name &quot;Renfe&quot; (acronym of &quot;Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles&quot;) is derived from that of the former Spanish National Railway Network created on 24 January 1941 with the nationalisation of Spain&#x27;s railways. As per EU Directive 91/440, Renfe was divided into Renfe Operadora (operations) and ADIF (infrastructure) on 1 January 2005. At the same time, the existing Renfe logo (nicknamed the &quot;galleta&quot;, Spanish for biscuit), first introduced in 1971, was replaced by a dark purple lower-case wordmark designed by Interbrand. Separate logos used by the other sectors were also replaced, but the old Renfe logo remains in use in some stations in Spain and on maps to indicate an ADIF station.

The &quot;Railway Sector Act, 2003&quot; separated the management, maintenance and construction of rail infrastructure from train operation. The first activity is now the responsibility of Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF), while the newly created Renfe-Operadora (also known as Grupo Renfe or simply Renfe) owns the rolling stock and remains responsible for the planning, marketing and operation of the passenger and freight services.

Renfe no longer has a monopoly on domestic passenger services due to Ouigo España launching in 2021, followed by Iryo in 2022.

==Structure==
Renfe-Operadora inherited the management model of the old Renfe, which made Renfe-Operadora responsible for the operation of the passenger and freight services. In January 2006, Renfe-Operadora restructured the main business units into four general directorates:

* Dirección General de Servicios Públicos de Cercanías y Media Distancia (General Public Utilities Directorate for Suburban and Medium Distance): responsible for commuter services (Cercanías), medium-distance high-speed rail AVE services and medium-range regional services (:es:Regionales and :es:Media Distancia). However, control of some Cercanías services were transferred to Spain&#x27;s Autonomous communities.
* Dirección General de Servicios de Larga Distancia (General Directorate of Long Distance Services): responsible for long-distance intercity and high-speed rail services (except medium-distance AVE services and Media Distancia, which is managed by the above business unit).
* Dirección General de Servicios de Mercancías y Logística (General Directorate for Freight and Logistics Services): responsible for freight services.
* Dirección General de Fabricación y Mantenimiento (General Directorate of Manufacturing and Maintenance): responsible for rolling stock maintenance and manufacture (also known as Integria).

In June 2013, Renfe&#x27;s board agreed to restructure the group into four separate companies under the holding company:
*Renfe Viajeros, operating passenger trains;
*Renfe Mercancías, freight;
*Renfe Fabricación y Mantenimiento, rolling stock maintenance;
*Renfe Alquiler de Material Ferroviario, train leasing.

== Figures ==
=== Operations ===
The company operates some of railways, of them electrified. Most of the tracks are constructed to the broad Iberian gauge of , the same as that used in Portugal but wider than the international gauge of which is standard in most of the rest of the world. The newer high-speed (AVE) network has been built to the international standard gauge of for the connection to the rest of the European railway system. For this reason, the gauge is generally termed &quot;European gauge&quot; in Spain.

Construction of a high-speed rail line between Madrid and Seville began in 1988 and began operations in 1991, going . The second high-speed rail line (Madrid to Barcelona) was completed in 2007 with the inaugural service commencing on 20 February 2008. The operational speed on this route is . The greater part of the line (Madrid to Lleida) entered service on 11 October 2003, with a connection to Huesca from Zaragoza. The third high-speed line (Madrid to Toledo) was opened in November 2005, followed by a spur from Córdoba to Málaga as far as Antequera in 2007. Another high-speed route from Madrid to Valladolid was opened in 2007. A line from Madrid to Valencia was opened in 2010, and the first stage of a high-speed line in Galicia opened in 2011. A line to Lisbon is being designed.

Other lines operated by Renfe include Euromed, a moderate-speed line between Barcelona and Alicante.

In addition to intercity transport, Renfe operates commuter train systems, known as &quot;Cercanías&quot; (or &quot;Rodalies&quot; in Catalonia and &quot;Cercanías-Aldirikoak&quot; in the Basque Country), in eleven metropolitan areas, including Madrid and Barcelona. In some cities, Renfe shares the market with other commuter railway operators, such as FGC.

In 2019, Renfe solicited bids for 31 new trains for the Asturias and Cantabria regions and the €258m contract was awarded to the CAF (Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles) in June 2020. Around February 2023, authorities discovered the designs were for the wrong loading gauge and would be too wide for the tunnels. Amidst international embarrassment, Renfe and ADIF each tried to deflect responsibility, and some called for the firing of the executives deemed responsible. Fortunately, the trains were still being designed, however the &quot;Cercanía&quot; commuter trains will be delayed until 2026. Subsequently, transport officials including the president of Renfe and the Secretary of State for Transport resigned.

In November 2024, Renfe bought a 33% shareholding in Arenaways.

== Passenger rolling stock ==
Renfe-Operadora utilises the following rolling stock and commercial products inside of its two divisions:
=== Suburban and Medium Distance (DGSPCMD) ===

==== Cercanías AM (Meter Gauge Commuter Services) ====
==== Cercanías (Commuter Services) ====
==== Mainline Medium Distance Services ====
==== High-Speed Medium Distance Services ====
=== Long Distance (DGSLD) ===
==== Luxury Tourist Train Services ====
==== Mainline Long Distance Services ====
==== High-Speed Long Distance Services ====
=== Prototype rolling stock ===
=== Future rolling stock ===
== Vehicles register numbers ==
All classes are designated by three numbers. The first digit has a special meaning:
* 1xx: High speed multiple unit
* 2xx: Electric locomotive
* 3xx: Diesel locomotive
* 4xx: Electric multiple unit (EMU)
* 5xx: Diesel multiple unit (DMU)
* 6xx: Hybrid locomotive
* 7xx: Hybrid multiple unit (HMU)
* 8xx: Trams which can run on railways

==Tickets==
Travel tickets are available from rail stations and online. In 2023 the European Commission initiated an investigation into concerns that Renfe might have been abusing its dominant position in the online ticketing market by refusing to share journey time information with competing ticketing websites. Renfe offered a number of commitments intended to address these concerns, which the European Commission made legally binding in January 2024 under the EU&#x27;s competition rules.

<text>Swiss Federal Railways (, SBB; , CFF; , FFS) is the national railway company of Switzerland.

The company was founded in 1902 and is headquartered in Bern. It used to be a government institution, but since 1999 it has been a special stock corporation whose shares are held by the Swiss Confederation and the Swiss cantons. It is the largest rail and transport company of Switzerland; it operates on most standard gauge lines of the Swiss railway network. It also heavily collaborates with most other transport companies of the country, such as the BLS, one of its main competitors, or (SOB), to provide fully integrated timetables with cyclic schedules.

SBB was ranked first among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index for its intensity of use, quality of service, and safety rating. While many rail operators in continental Europe have emphasised the building of high-speed rail, SBB has invested in the reliability and quality of service of its conventional rail network, on both national and regional scales. In addition to passenger rail, SBB operates cargo and freight rail service through its subsidiary SBB Cargo, and has large real estate holdings in Switzerland.

== Name ==
The company is commonly referred to by the initials of its three official names, in German, French and Italian – defined by federal law SR/RS 742.31 (SBBG/LCFF/LFFS) Art. 2 §1 – either as SBB CFF FFS, or used separately. The official English abbreviation is SBB.

While the official Romansh name, (VFF), can be found in federal laws and associated documents, as well as Romansh-language media, it is not used by the company itself.

==Organisation==
Swiss Federal Railways is divided into three divisions and eight groups. The divisions manage the relevant operational businesses. These divisions are:
* Passenger traffic
* Infrastructure
* Real estate

The former division Cargo became an independent group company at the beginning of 2019.

SBB&#x27;s eight groups manage the company and support the operational business of the divisions with service and support functions. These groups are:
* Finance
* HR
* IT
* Communications
* Corporate Development
* Safety &amp; Quality
* Legal and Compliance
* Supply Chain Management

The corporation is led in an entrepreneurial manner. A performance agreement between Swiss Federal Railways and the Swiss Confederation defines the requirements and is updated every four years. At the same time the compensation rates per train and track-kilometre are defined.

A German subsidiary, SBB GmbH, is responsible for passenger traffic in Germany. It operates the Wiesentalbahn, the Seehas services and services of Schaffhausen S-Bahn. Other subsidiaries are Thurbo, RegionAlps, AlpTransit Gotthard AG, Cisalpino, and TiLo (the latter in conjunction with Italian authorities). Swiss Federal Railways hold significant shares of the Zentralbahn (ZB) and Lyria SAS.

The (SBB Historic) was founded in 2002. This foundation takes care of historic rolling stock and runs a technical library in Bern, document and photographic archives, and the SBB poster collection.

==Figures==

All figures from 2021:

The Swiss Federal Railways rail network is totally electrified. Its last non-electrified railway line (Etzwilen–Singen) was closed to regular traffic in 2004 and it is now a heritage railway.

The metre gauge Brünigbahn was SBB&#x27;s only non-standard gauge line, until it was out-sourced and merged with the Luzern-Stans-Engelberg-Bahn to form the Zentralbahn, in which SBB holds shares.

==History==

In the 19th century, all Swiss railways were owned by private ventures. The economic and political interests of these companies led to lines being built in parallel and some companies went bankrupt in the resulting competition. On 20 February 1898, the Swiss people agreed in a referendum to the creation of a state-owned railway company.

Later that year, the Federal Assembly approved the purchase of &quot;Schweizerische Centralbahn&quot; (SCB) to operate trains on behalf of the federal government. The first train running on the account of the Swiss Confederation ran during the night of New Year&#x27;s Eve 1900/New Year&#x27;s Day 1901 from Zurich via Bern to Geneva, and received a ceremonial welcome upon arriving in Bern. SBB&#x27;s management board was first formed in mid-1901, and added the &quot;Schweizerische Nordostbahn&quot; (NOB) to the system on 1 January 1902. This date is now observed as the &quot;official&quot; birthday of SBB.

The following railway companies were nationalised:
*Aargauische Südbahn (ASB)
*Bötzbergbahn (BöB)
*Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB)
*Schweizerische Centralbahn (SCB)
*Toggenburgerbahn (TB)
*Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen (VSB)
*Tösstalbahn including the Wald-Rüti Railway (WR)
*Wohlen-Bremgarten Railway (WB)
*Jura-Simplon-Bahn (JS) including the Brünigbahn (the latter in 1903)

Other companies were included later, and the rail network was extended. It is still growing today.

On 1 January 1999 the Swiss Federal Railway has been excluded from the Federal Administration and became a fully state-owned (the federal state owns 100% of all shares) limited company regulated by public law ().

First class compartments were discontinued on 3 June 1956, and second and third class accommodation was reclassified as first and second class, respectively.

In 1982, SBB introduced the (clock-face schedule), with trains for certain destinations leaving every 60 minutes, greatly simplifying the timetable.

On 12 December 2004 the first phase of , an ambitious programme to improve the company&#x27;s services, was put into effect. The core element was the –– triangle, where travel times between the cities was reduced to under one hour, resulting in good connections from these stations for most trains. Some connections between cities got two trains in each direction per hour or more, and the S-Bahn services were intensified to four or more trains per hour. Because of these changes, 90% of the timetable was changed, 12% more trains were scheduled and travel times generally improved. It was the greatest timetable change since the introduction of the .

For this change to be possible, large parts of the infrastructure had to be modified and many stations were rebuilt, for instance the line from Ziegelbrücke to Sargans or Bern main station, which got the &quot;wave of Bern&quot;, a bridge over the tracks to provide better access to the platforms and the city centre.

On 22 June 2005, a short circuit on a long-distance power transmission line in central Switzerland led to a chain reaction. The entire Swiss railway network was out of service during rush hour and an estimated 200,000 people and 1,500 trains were stuck at stations or somewhere on the track. It turned out that the SBB power transmission network was overloaded and did not provide enough redundancy to tolerate the shutdown of the four cable Amsteg-Steinen power line due to construction work. So, the power grid was split in two parts, the northern half being overloaded and the southern half having a load reduction for the SBB power plants are situated in the southern part (the Alps), while most of the power is needed in the northern part (the Swiss plateau). The situation led to high-voltage fluctuations and finally breakdown and emergency shutdown of the entire power supply.

In the same year, the Swiss Federal Railways received the Wakker Prize, an award given out by the Swiss (an institution aiming to preserve significant buildings), which is usually only granted to communes, for their extraordinary efforts. The Swiss Federal Railways have many listed buildings from well-known architects such as Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Santiago Calatrava, and Max Vogt.

In May 2010, SBB&#x27;s first integrated network control centre opened in Lausanne, to supervise all of SBB&#x27;s network in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Another integrated control centre will be opened in Zurich.

All trains and most buildings have been made non-smoking since the timetable change of 11 December 2005.

By the end of 2006, the corporation was handed over from the long-term CEO Benedikt Weibel to his successor Andreas Meyer.

On 13 January 2019, Bloomberg reported that SBB was in talks with German aviation company Lilium GmbH to create air taxis to carry customers from train stations to their final destination.

==Clock==

The Swiss Federal Railways clock designed by Hans Hilfiker has become a national icon. It is special in that it stops for just over a second at the end of each minute, to wait for a signal from the master clock which sets it going again — thus keeping all station clocks synchronised.

The clock owes its technology to the particular requirements of operating a railway. First, railway timetables do not list seconds; trains in Switzerland always leave the station on the full minute. Secondly, all the clocks at a railway station have to run synchronously in order to show reliable time for both passengers and railway personnel anywhere on or around the station.

The station clocks in Switzerland are synchronized by receiving an electrical impulse from a central master clock at each full minute, advancing the minute hand by one minute. The second hand is driven by an electrical motor independent of the master clock. It requires only about 58.5 seconds to circle the face, then the hand pauses briefly at the top of the clock. It starts a new rotation as soon as it receives the next minute impulse from the master clock. This movement is emulated in some of the licensed timepieces made by Mondaine.

==Rolling stock==

===Mainline locomotives===
Steam engines of the early days of the Swiss Federal Railways were, among others, the Ed 2x2/2, E 3/3, A 3/5, B 3/4 and C 5/6.

The first electric trial runs using single-phase alternating current were made in 1903 on the line Seebach – Wettingen together with the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon (MFO), using the future Ce 4/4 locomotives (&quot;Eva&quot; and &quot;Marianne&quot;). The electrification of the network started 1919, motivated by the coal shortages during the First World War, and new electric locomotives were introduced: Ce 6/8 II/Ce 6/8 III &quot;Crocodile&quot; (1920–1926), Be 4/6 (1920), Be 4/7 (1921), Ae 3/6 I (1921), Ae 3/6 II (1924), Ae 3/6 III (1925), Ae 4/7 (1927) and Ae 4/6 (1941). A shift of paradigms happened in 1946, when the age of modern bogie-based locomotives without trailing axles started with the Re 4/4 I (1946), followed by the Ae 6/6 (1952), Re 4/4 II/Re 4/4 III (1964–1971), Re 6/6 (1972), Re 450 (1989) and Re 460/Re 465 &quot;Lok 2000&quot; (1992–1994).

The delivery of the last Re 465 marked the end of the Swiss locomotive industries with the closure of the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works. The Swiss Federal Railways were split into three divisions: passenger, freight and infrastructure, each with independent locomotive supply policies. Because the passenger division got all modern Re 460s and opted for multiple unit trains, mainline locomotives were bought only by the cargo division, namely Re 482 &quot;Traxx F140 AC&quot; (2002), Re 484 &quot;Traxx F140 MS&quot; (2004) and Re 474 &quot;ES64 F4&quot; (2004).

===Multiple units===
The first multiple units originated from the &quot;Seetalbahn&quot;, which was formed in 1922. Larger series were uncommon until after 1950: Be 4/6 (1923), De 4/4 (1927), BDe 4/4 (1952), RBe 4/4 (1959), RBDe 560 &quot;NPZ&quot; (1984) and RABe 520 &quot;GTW&quot; (2002).

The first multiple unit trainsets were bought for the introduction of the on the Zurich–Meilen–Rapperswil line in 1967: RABDe 12/12 &quot; (1965) and RABDe 8/16 &quot; (1976). Multiple unit trainsets started to prevail in the 1990s, especially for commuter traffic: RABDe 500 &quot;ICN&quot; (1999), RABe 523 (et al.) &quot;FLIRT&quot; (2004), RABe 514 &quot;DTZ&quot; (2006), and RABe 503 (2008). While locomotive-hauled trains are rarely seen in commuter traffic nowadays, they are still the usual in long-distance traffic. In 2011, Stadler&#x27;s RABe 511 were introduced in Zurich&#x27;s S-Bahn and in 2012 was introduced as a RegioExpress (RE) between Geneva and Romont, between Geneva and Vevey, and between Bern and Biel/Bienne.

Some of the most popular historic multiple unit trainsets are the Roten Pfeile (, RAe 2/4) and the &quot;Churchill-Pfeil&quot; (RAe 4/8). In international traffic, the Trans-Europ-Express (TEE) diesel trainsets appeared in 1957, but were replaced by four-systems electric trainsets RAe TEEII in 1961.

On 12 May 2010, the Swiss Federal Railways announced its largest order of rolling stock; buying 59 double-deck EMUs (Twindexx/RABe 502) from Bombardier Inc., plus an option for another 100 trainsets. The new trains were originally intended to be delivered starting in 2012, but due to several delays, deliveries began in 2017 and end by 2020.

In addition, SBB has received and, as of 2016, is still in the process of delivering, New Pendolino (RABe 503) multiple units and has ordered 29 SMILEs (RABe 501), with an option for 92 more, expected to enter service in 2019.

==Languages==
SBB uses three official languages: , , and . The Romansh-speaking regions in the Swiss canton of Grisons () is served mostly by the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). Locomotices and railcars are branded &quot;SBB CFF FFS&quot;.

Stations are named and signposted exclusively in the language of the locality. Stations of bilingual cities are named and signposted in both local languages (e.g. and ). The timetable only uses such official names regardless of the languages of the timetable.

Announcements in stations are usually made in local languages. However, in stations frequently used by foreigners (airports or tourism regions), in-station announcements are also made in English. On-board welcome announcements are made in all official languages of the regions served by that train, with the additional English ones onboard IC trains. Then the stops are announced in the pre-recorded local language of the town. For stations of bilingual cities, the language of announcement changes at the time of stop: when trains travelling from the French-speaking region to the German-speaking region via the bilingual city of Biel/Bienne, announcements are made in French until arriving at Bienne, and then switch to German after departing from Biel. Upon arriving at big hubs, the train conductor takes the microphone to announce in all official languages of the regions served by that train (plus English onboard IC trains) that the train is arriving, if the train is on time or not, and next connections at the station.

For instance, the main station in the German-speaking Zurich is signposted as &quot;&quot; (short for ) exclusively in German, while its French name , Italian name , and English name (Zurich Main Station) are used in websites and announcements in respective languages.
Since 2002, SBB has used music in train announcements. The notes in the music correspond to the acronyms SBB CFF FFS, transposed by means of the German notes &quot;Es - B - B&quot; (E, B, B), &quot;C - F - F&quot; (C, F, F) and &quot;F - F - Es&quot; (F, F, E). For the German acronym, as there is no &quot;S&quot; note, the &quot;Es&quot; was used. And for the last letter, it is the B/G chord that is played. The melody is played on a vibraphone. The melody played depends on which canton (or country onboard international services) the station or train is located in, and manual announcements play the three-language melody in the file above.

==Services==
===Train services===


SBB has the following services:

* R#: Regio (), typically numbered, stops at all stations
* S#: S-Bahn (commuter train), typically numbered, organized as a rapid transit system in major agglomerations, with several lines and generally high frequent service (see S-Bahn networks in Switzerland).
** S-Bahn services in the French speaking part of Switzerland are often designated with R# for (e.g. RER Vaud) or RL# (Léman Express).
* RE#: RegioExpress, since the 2023 timetable change numbered, stops only at selected stations within a region.
* IR#: InterRegio, since the 2017 timetable change numbered, are the workhorses of Swiss transit. They reach across two or three cantons.
* IC#: InterCity, since the 2017 timetable change numbered, stops only at major cities.
** ICN: InterCity Tilting Train (), similar to the IC, but using tilting trains instead of standard/double-decked trains. The ICN designation was discontinued as of 10 December 2017, with former ICN services now being branded as IC, but still run by tilting trains.
* PE: Panorama Express, introduced in 2019, are tourist oriented long-distance services (e.g. the Gotthard Panorama Express).
*EXT: Charter train or special train added when an exceptionally heavy traffic is expected.

Several services are currently operated by other railway companies, including subsidiaries of Swiss Federal Railways (e.g. Thurbo). Some services are also jointly operated with other companies (e.g. ).

SBB CFF FFS also operates international EuroCity (EC) and EuroNight (EN) trains while within Switzerland, while operates Intercity Express (ICE) services to, from, and (a few services) within the country serving Swiss cities such as Interlaken, Bern, Basel, Zurich, and Chur. Under the name TGV Lyria the French railway company SNCF operates TGV connections to Switzerland. Lyria SAS, a company established under French law, is a subsidiary of the French National Railway Company, SNCF, which owns 74%, and the Swiss Federal Railways, which owns 26%. TGV Lyria serves several Swiss cities including Geneva, Lausanne, Basel, Zurich, Bern, and Interlaken. It also provides services to certain locations including Brig (Valais), especially during the winter season, to provide a connection for tourists mainly visiting the south-eastern Swiss Alps. These connections are marketed under the name of .

=== Lines ===
Since 2018, the SBB uses numbers and distinct colors for all its InterCity (IC) and InterRegio (IR) lines (like a subway network) to ease connections. The IC, IR and RE (RegioExpress) lines (including alternative routes) are as follows:

==== InterCity ====

InterCity (IC) are mainline trains in Switzerland connecting the country&#x27;s major agglomerations, the range of services (in Switzerland) of which is located between InterRegio (IR, inter-regional) and EuroCity (EC).

==== InterRegio ====

InterRegio (IR) is a European train category, with Switzerland possessing the most dense network. IR trains are semi-fast long-distance trains with more stops and usually lower prices than more upscale long-distance trains such as the InterCity. 

Lines IR26 (since 2020), IR35 (since 2021), and IR46 (since 2020) are jointly operated with Südostbahn (SOB). Lines IR17 and IR65 are operated by BLS since December 2020 and December 2019, respectively.

==== Regio Express ====
===Customer services===
SBB offers additional services for customers. SBB Digital promotes new digital services for customers. For example, SBB started a collaboration with the recruiting matchmaking service, Jacando, and their own co-working space in Zurich. SBB has won CRM awards in Switzerland for their SBB Digital activities.

<text>Philmont Scout Ranch is a ranch located in Colfax County, New Mexico, United States, near the village of Cimarron; it covers of wilderness in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains on the east side of the Cimarron Range of the Rocky Mountains. Donated by oil baron Waite Phillips and originally operated under the name Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp, the ranch is owned and operated by Scouting America. It is a National High Adventure Base where crews of Scouts and Venturers take part in backpacking treks and other outdoor activities. By land area, it is one of the largest youth camps in the world. 

Philmont is also home to the Philmont Training Center, the National Scouting Museum and the Seton Memorial Library. The Training Center is the primary location for Scouting America’s national volunteer training programs. Philmont is a working ranch, maintaining small herds of cattle, horses, burros, and bison.

The only documented &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; track in the world was discovered within the camp&#x27;s boundaries in 1993 in North Ponil Canyon by the Anasazi Trail Camp. It was formally identified in 1994.

There are three other high adventure camps owned and maintained by Scouting America: Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases in Minnesota, as well as Manitoba and Ontario in Canada; Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in the Florida Keys; and Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in southern West Virginia.

==Location and geography==


Philmont is located in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico. The closest village is Cimarron, New Mexico. The address of the ranch is usually given as 17 Deer Run Rd., Cimarron, New Mexico, 87714. It is also about west-northwest of Springer, New Mexico, and southwest of Raton, New Mexico. Philmont is about across (east to west) at its widest point, and about long (north to south). There are no mountains to the south or east of Philmont. The interior of the ranch is mountainous but a small part of the eastern area is prairie.

Philmont&#x27;s lowest point is the southeast corner at and its highest point is the peak of Baldy Mountain, located on the ranch&#x27;s northwest boundary, at . Aside from Baldy, the ranch contains a number of prominent peaks. The South Country is home to a series of six difficult peaks, namely Mount Phillips, Comanche Peak, Big Red, Bear Mountain, Black Mountain, and Schaefers Peak, as well as Trail Peak, which is popular for its nearness to Beaubien, and the wreckage of the crash of a B-24 bomber in 1942 near its summit. Of the ranch&#x27;s various peaks with trail access, Black Mountain is widely considered the most difficult, followed closely by Baldy and Big Red.

The most recognizable landmark is the Tooth of Time at , a dacite monolith protruding vertically from an east-west ridge. Tooth of Time Ridge, and the latitude line on which it sits, marks the boundary between the central and southern sections of Philmont. The boundary between the central and northern sections is around U.S. Route 64, which runs just south of the narrowest part of the &#x27;I&#x27;-shape, which is only a few miles across. Other prominent landmarks on the ranch include Grizzly Tooth, Window Rock, Deer Lake Mesa, Wilson Mesa and Urraca Mesa.

==History==
Native Americans of the Jicarilla Apache tribe and Ute tribe once inhabited Philmont. A few Native American archaeological sites exist in the northern section nearby the &#x27;Indian Writings&#x27; camp, and various camps seek to preserve Philmont&#x27;s Native American heritage.

On April 22, 1942, a B-24 Liberator crashed into the side of Trail Peak. Some of the wreckage still remains, including a wing and propeller, and because of its location, it is the world&#x27;s most visited airplane crash site.

===Private ownership===

The Santa Fe Trail crossed the plains just southwest of Philmont in the mid-1800s. The Tooth of Time owes its name to this trail; travelers knew that once they passed it, they had only one week to go until they reached Santa Fe, New Mexico. Philmont&#x27;s strategic location along the trail spurred some interest in it. In 1841, Carlos Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda obtained a large land grant from the Mexican government, including the present ranch. Soon the grant passed on to Beaubien&#x27;s son-in-law Lucien Maxwell, who played an important role in developing and settling it. Maxwell sold the ranch to the Maxwell Land Grant and Railroad Company, which gave up and handed it on to a Dutch development company, which decided to parcel it out to ranchers.

One of the most prominent ranchers was Jesus Gil Abreu, who ran the Abreu Rayado Ranch from the 1870s till his death in 1901. Operating from the Rayado Settlement, he raised cattle, goats, and sheep and grew crops. The family owned this property until 1911, when they sold most of it off. One of the sons remained on the ranch near the site of Abreu, a present staffed camp, and his homestead was preserved for years. Eventually, the adobe structure was abandoned, and it collapsed. The foundation of this building now serves as the foundation for the Abreu cantina. The house was reconstructed in 1998 about uphill.

The history of mining at Philmont dates back to the years immediately after the Civil War. U.S. soldiers were stationed in the West after the war, as the U.S. Army was driving out the Native Americans. At Fort Union, some stationed soldiers traded with Native Americans for float copper. In 1866, the soldiers went up Baldy Mountain in search of this copper, but instead found gold. They could not stay to mine the gold due to the approaching winter, but by the time they returned in the spring, the area was overrun with prospectors. Scores of gold mines were excavated and operated into the early 20th century on what was once the Baldy Mining District, now modern day Philmont. Today, the Contention Mine, located at Cyphers Mine, and the Aztec Mine, located above French Henry, are open to guided tours.

Wealthy oil magnate and wilderness enthusiast Waite Phillips amassed a large part of the old land grant in the 1920s, totaling over . Phillips built a large residence in the lowlands of Philmont. He turned the ranch into a private game reserve for himself and friends, and built a number of hunting lodges and day-use camps. He chose not to provide electricity at the remote camps. A few of these original camps, including Fish Camp and the Hunting Lodge, have been preserved, complete with wood-burning stoves, oil lamps, and unique design features indicative of Phillips&#x27;s often eccentric taste.

===Donated to Boy Scouts===
Phillips sometimes allowed others, including a few Boy Scout troops, to visit his ranch. He was so impressed with the Scouts that in 1938, during the Great Depression, he donated of his land to the Boy Scouts of America. His only condition was that the property be used &quot;for the benefit of the members of the Boy Scout organization&quot;. He donated a second, larger section of land later in the 1930s, requiring only that this section pay its fair share of taxes on any portion devoted to competitive commercial operations.

In 1941, Phillips added more Philmont property, including the Villa Philmonte, bringing the total to . Contrary to popular belief, Phillips did not donate his entire ranch to the Boy Scouts, but only that portion of the property that provided the most recreational value. The total donation comprised about 40% of the ranch. To help fund maintenance of Philmont, he also donated the Philtower office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1963, vice-president of the National Council Norton Clapp contributed funds to purchase another of land within the Maxwell Land Grant, consisting of the Baldy Mountain mining area. In 2015, the Boy Scouts of America purchased that was once operated as a camp called Cimarroncita Ranch.

In 1989, the Boy Scouts obtained a renewable special use permit to the Valle Vidal Unit of the Carson National Forest from the United States Forest Service. This allowed Scouts to hike and camp in the area. Philmont operates three staffed camps—Whiteman Vega, Seally Canyon, and Ring Place—and two trail camps in that area. Those camps serve around 3,000 Scouts each summer. In return, each camper is asked to contribute three hours of conservation work in the Valle on projects approved by the Forest Service.

Rich Cabins, a historical farming cabin on Ted Turner&#x27;s Vermejo Park Ranch, is operated as a staff camp.

===2019 mortgage===

Philmont was mortgaged in March 2019, in order to support the BSA financially while it was settling sex abuse cases. An oversight committee member claimed that this was in violation of the 1938 donation that gave the organization the land, but the BSA disagreed.

===Early organization===
In its early days, Philmont had a half dozen &quot;base camps&quot; constructed at strategic locations. Visiting Scouts lived at one of these camps for a week and could take day hikes to surrounding locations. To visit a different area, the Scouts packed their gear onto burros and hiked to another base camp. Today, the program is based on backpacking, and Scouts carry all their gear, living in tents while on expedition.

==Programs and activities==
===Trek===
The standard and most popular Philmont program is the backpacking &quot;trek&quot;. A typical Philmont trek lasts 12 days and covers anywhere from to .

===Conservation Department===
There are six divisions of the Conservation Department in the summer, each led by an Associate Director of Conservation - Work Crew, Forestry Crew, Conservationists, GIS, Environmental Education (ROCS, Trail Crew Trek), and Order of the Arrow Trail Crew. Work Crews are staff groups who are responsible for maintaining and creating campsites and trails. Trail Crews and other staff known as Advanced Teams are the first Conservation staffers to begin hiking and clearing the trails, one month prior to the first participants&#x27; arrival. Conservationists live in staff camps or spike camps and lead conservation projects for treks passing through their camp. The GIS staff map trails, campsites, and other features of the Philmont Backcountry. In recognition of the 100th anniversary of the BSA, Northrop Grumman donated high-resolution geospatial data of the ranch to Philmont. GIS and the Conservation Department use the data to create enhanced maps and improve conservation efforts throughout the ranch. The Division of Forestry&#x27;s priority is forest fuels reduction. Using chainsaws, a masticator, a skidder, and a portable sawmill, these crews create defensible space around staff camps and strategic shaded fuel breaks to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire and improve the health and productivity of Philmont&#x27;s forests while utilizing the wood in construction projects around the Ranch. Slash from the thinning projects is piled and burned and a prescribed fire program is being developed to maintain desired forest condition. The Forestry crews work year-round, and each staff member receives detailed training in chainsaw operations, as well as an overview of forest management and fire ecology.

====Roving Outdoor Conservation School====

The Roving Outdoor Conservation School (ROCS), started in 2000, is a twenty-one day trek program that is open to males and females between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one. ROCS is an educational backpacking experience rooted in conservation and environmental science education. Throughout the trek participants have lessons rooted in environmental science, visits from guest speakers, and the opportunity to work on conservation projects with the Philmont Conservation Department and the U.S. Forest Service in the Valle Vidal Unit of the Carson National Forest. While on the trail participants learn about ecology, botany, dendrology, geology, hydrology, forestry, soil science, fire ecology, environmental policy, leave no trace principles, environmental ethics, conservation techniques, and wildlife, range, and land management practices. Participants tackle conservation projects ranging from trailbuilding to meadow encroachment to timber stand improvement to erosion control to streambed restoration. Participants are exposed to the land management challenges facing the West, as well as the rest of America. The program focuses on empowering participants so that they may transfer what they learn on the trail to their lives back home.
===Ranger Department===
The Ranger Department was founded in 1957 by Clarence E. Dunn, Jack Rhea and Dr. Ray Loomis, the former of which served as chief ranger for 14 years. Rangers are responsible for ensuring that all participants know all required skills and procedures needed for backcountry treks, and for coaching the youth leadership to help them develop their skills and confidence and have a successful trek. They hike along with crews on the 12-day treks for the first two days on the trail, during which time they teach and observe the crew. They are also responsible for Search and rescue on Philmont property and in surrounding areas. The Ranger Department also includes Mountain Trek Rangers who lead the week-long Mountain Treks that originate in the Philmont Training Center.

Ranger Trainers, experienced staff who have finished one or more seasons as a Ranger, train and supervise Rangers. Each trainer oversees from 8-10 Rangers in a Ranger Training Crew and are expected to lead two backpacking crews per summer. In the summer of 2013 there were roughly 240 people in the Ranger Department, organized into 25 training crews. Upper ranger leadership consists of coordinators for the Rayado, Mountain Trek, Service Academy, and scheduling programs, four Associate Chief Rangers, and the Chief Ranger. During the summer of 2007, the Philmont Staff Association coordinated a 50th Anniversary Ranger Reunion at the ranch. Over 300 former Rangers attended this event.

===Ranch Hands===

A program in which young men and women can earn a discounted eight-day Cavalcade trek at Philmont by participating in an eight-day work session. Participants work with the Horse Department staff taking care of Philmont&#x27;s 250 head of horses and 80 head of burros. Participants help by hauling hay and feed, saddling horses, helping keep the horses shod, and assisting on Philmont trail rides. The work can be strenuous and requires top physical and mental conditioning. After the eight-day work session, the Ranch Hands crew gathers together and embarks on an eight-day Cavalcade under the leadership of a Horseman and Wrangler.

===National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience===

National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience (NAYLE) is a high-intensity Boy Scout leadership course taught at Philmont Scout Ranch. It is based on backcountry high adventure skills and began in the summer of 2006 replacing the previous National Junior Leader Instructor Course. The course is available to Boy Scouts and Venturers aged 14 through 20 who have completed their local council National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) course and is held during six one-week sessions. Based at Philmont&#x27;s Rayado Ridge Leadership Camp and taught at various locations across Philmont Scout Ranch, the program hones youth leadership skills through ethical decision making and participation in Philmont Ranger backcountry training.

===Historic programs===

====Philbreak====
The Philbreak program ran from 2003 to 2009, and returned in 2019. It was an &quot;alternative spring break&quot; program started in 2003 to help restore Philmont Scout Ranch after devastating forest fires. From 2004 to 2007, the participants worked on the Urraca Trail, which is intended as a day hike for those attending the Philmont Training Center. Participants in the seven-day program were expected to work eight- or nine-hour days in all types of conditions. The program took place during three separate weeks during March. Participants also had an opportunity to take a ski break at Angel Fire. In 2008, the design of the program switched to mirror that of Philmont&#x27;s Kanik. Participants spent three days and two nights in Philmont&#x27;s backcountry as well as provided service on the final day. The program ended in 2010. In 2019, after the Ute Park Fire in 2018, Philbreak returned with four week-long sessions in March to help with fire mitigation.

==Philmont facilities==

===Camps===
Philmont operates from one large base camp, including Camping Headquarters, the National Scouting Museum, the Philmont Training Center and Villa Philmonte, fire response facilities, cattle headquarters, and an administration area. During the 2012 season there were 34 staffed camps and 77 unstaffed or &quot;trail camps&quot;. Only some trail camps have a potable water source. Camps without water are referred to as &quot;dry camps&quot;. Most of Philmont&#x27;s camps are about apart. Old camps are closed or relocated and new camps are opened every few years. Some camp sites are closed due to changing safety protocols. For example, camps were once located on top of Urraca Mesa and in the Baldy Saddle but these are unlikely to reopen because the locations are at risk for lightning strikes.

==Natural disasters==
===1960 tornado===
On June 25, 1960, a Fujita scale F0 tornado swept through Philmont&#x27;s base camp area, downing about 300 tents located on a flat near Ranch Headquarters and depositing camping gear over Tooth of Time Ridge. Four 1960 National Jamboree troops from New Mexico—Troops 78, 79, 80 and 82—had gathered at Philmont for a shakedown camp. Three other New Mexico troops had gone to Camp Zia for their shakedown. The troops each had 32 boys, two Assistant Scoutmasters and one Scoutmaster. Troops were camping in wall tents which they had decorated before going to the Jamboree. Each wall tent had a wooden frame with a thick wooden roof pole for support. The boys were learning how to cook over charcoal fires and the fires had just been started for the evening meal. The twister arrived without warning. As the wind suddenly increased, boys ran to secure the tents, but to no avail. The winds swept up tents, fires, men and boys, rolling nearby automobiles and leveling the camp. Injuries included broken bones, blunt force injuries from flying debris—including shattered roof poles—and burns from charcoal fires and equipment ignited by the fires. The twister also leveled a nearly completed cinder block chapel. After the passage of the storm, gear and equipment could be seen in the funnel cloud as it left the area. Camping equipment was found as far as 14 miles away from the campsite and was recovered by ranch hands. Boys were housed for the night in other facilities, and the next day boys passed among piles of recovered equipment to reclaim what they could. Although there were no fatalities, 33 Boy Scouts and a Scout leader received injuries.

===1965 flash flood===
On June 17, 1965, a large flash flood occurred at Philmont. Heavy rain throughout the area caused waters in Rayado Canyon and the Cimarron River to rise to extreme levels; up to 12.42 feet at the highest. After June 17, water levels gradually decreased over the course of several days. The impacts of the flood included the destruction of several campsites and the loss of many old photographs and documents kept at Philmont, however no injuries or deaths resulted from the flood. The flood occurred during an El Niño year.

===Ponil Complex Fire===

The Ponil Complex Fire started on June 2, 2002 and burned until June 17. The burn zone covered total; of Philmont, of the Elliott Barker Wildlife Area, of the Valle Vidal, of the WS Ranch and of the UU Bar Ranch. One third of the burn zone was totally burned while another third was only lightly to moderately burned. About one third of the burn zone escaped relatively unharmed, due to being sections of valleys that the fire jumped over or being not as dried out and likely to burn because of nearby water.

The burn zone is currently revegetating, some areas of which were reseeded while others began recovering naturally.

===2015 flash flood===

On the morning of June 27, 2015, heavy rain occurred in a great portion of Philmont, causing a flash flood. The flood also affected some other nearby areas in Colfax County that morning, including highways and small towns around Philmont. One youth Scout, Alden Brock, who was situated in a campsite within the staff camp Indian Writings, drowned while being swept away by the flood and died. Brock&#x27;s death received nationwide attention, especially from the Scouting community.

===Ute Park Fire===
On May 31, 2018, a wildfire started one mile east of the community Ute Park, New Mexico. The cause remains under investigation. By the morning of June 1, the Ute Park Fire had almost doubled in size to , burning entirely on private land, including Philmont Scout Ranch. Twelve structures at Philmont, all unoccupied and non-residential, were reported as burned. All backcountry treks at Philmont Scout Ranch for the entire 2018 summer season were cancelled, though PTC courses—including the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience—remained in session. The fire burned a total of 26,000 acres at Philmont, damaging 200 campsites.

=== Cooks Peak Fire ===
On April 17, 2022, a wildfire started 10 miles south of the Kit Carson Museum at Rayado. Heavily impacted areas of the fire include northern Mora County and southern Colfax County. The cause still remains under investigation. Zastrow Cabin, which was located in Philmont&#x27;s south country, was destroyed. Philmont staff along with wildland firefighter personnel have wrapped the Fish camp Cabin, as well as other buildings within the south country. The fire was largely contained before the season began, allowing crews to proceed with their treks as normal.

==Astronaut training==

NASA and the USGS used the site to geologically train the Apollo Astronauts in June 1964. In the words of Phinney, the site was &quot;...probably more like lunar geology.&quot; Training included recognizing &quot;both igneous and sedimentary rocks, orientation with geologic maps, measuring and describing stratigraphic sections, strike and dip measurements, recording of field notes ... and geophysical traverses that included taking measurements with magnetometers, gravimeters and seismometers in an attempt to determine subsurface structure.&quot; Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 11&#x27;s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 12&#x27;s Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, Apollo 15&#x27;s David Scott, and Apollo 17&#x27;s Gene Cernan. Notable geologist instructors included G.D. Robinson.

<doc id="224243" wikidata="Q19429" url="?curid=224243" title="Petrovaradin">
<text>Petrovaradin (, ) is a historic town in the Serbian province of Vojvodina, now a part of the city of Novi Sad. As of 2011, the urban area has 14,810 inhabitants. Lying on the right bank of the Danube, across the main part of Novi Sad, it is built around the Petrovaradin Fortress, the historical anchor of the modern city.

==Name==
Petrovaradin was founded by the Celts, but its original name is unknown. During Roman administration it was known as &quot;Cusum&quot;. After the Romans conquered the region from the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, they built the Cusum fortress where present Petrovaradin Fortress now stands. In addition, the town received its name from the Byzantines, who called it &quot;Petrikon or Petrikov (Πετρικον)&quot; and who presumably named it after Saint Peter.

In documents from 1237, the town was first mentioned under the name &quot;Peturwarod&quot; (&quot;Pétervárad&quot;), which was named after Hungarian lord Peter, son of Töre. Petrovaradin was known under the name &quot;Pétervárad&quot; during Hungarian administration, &quot;Varadin&quot; or &quot;Petervaradin&quot; during Ottoman administration, and &quot;Peterwardein&quot; during Habsburg administration.

Today, the municipality is known in Serbian as &quot;Петроварадин&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Pétervárad&quot;, and in German as &quot;Peterwardein&quot;.

==Geography==
Petrovaradin is located in the Syrmia region, on the Danube river and Fruška Gora, a horst mountain with elevation of 78–220 m (municipality up to 451 m). The northern part of Fruška Gora consists of massive landslide zones, but they are not active, except in Ribnjak neighborhood (between Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin fortress).

==History==
Human settlement in the territory of present-day Petrovaradin has been traced as far back as the Stone Age (about 4500 BC). This region was conquered by Celts (in the 4th century BC) and Romans (in the 1st century BC).

The Celts founded the first fortress at this location. It was part of the tribal state of the Scordisci, which had its capital in Singidunum (present-day Belgrade). During the Roman administration, a larger fortress was built (in the 1st century) with the name &quot;Cusum&quot; and was included into Roman Pannonia. Subsequently, the fortress was included into the Pannonia Inferior and the Pannonia Secunda. In the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by the invasion of the Huns.

The town was then conquered by Ostrogoths, Gepids, and Lombards. By the end of the 5th century, Byzantines had reconstructed the town and called it by the names &quot;Cusum&quot; and &quot;Petrikon&quot; or &quot;Petrikov&quot;. It was part of the Byzantine province of Pannonia. Subsequently, it passed into the hands of Avars, Franks, Bulgarians and Byzantines again. During Bulgarian administration, the town was known as &quot;Petrik&quot; and was part of the domain of duke Sermon, while during subsequent Byzantine administration, it was part of the Theme of Sirmium.

Later, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Between 1522 and 1526, Petrovaradin was a base for the early Ŝajkaš regiments, but in 1526, the Ottoman Empire took Petrovaradin after a two-week battle waged against combined forces of Croats, Serbs and Hungarians.

In the war of 1683–1699 with the Habsburg monarchy, the Ottomans abandoned Petrovaradin. In 1690, they returned for just two years. After that, Petrovaradin remained under Habsburg control as a part of the Slavonian Military Frontier.

In 1695, a military force of Serbs—600 infantry and 200 cavalry—under Captain Pane Božić were brought to Petrovaradin to serve. One thousand Serbs worked on the construction of the Citadel and fortifications under the guidance of military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.

During Hungarian administration, the town was firstly part of the Bolgyán County and then part of the Syrmia County, while during Ottoman administration, it was firstly part of the vassal duchy of Syrmia ruled by Serb duke Radoslav Čelnik (1527–1530), and then part of the Sanjak of Syrmia.

During the Ottoman administration, Petrovaradin had 200 houses and three mosques. There was also a Christian quarter with 35 houses populated with Croats.
Petrovaradin was the site of a notable battle on August 5, 1716 in which the Habsburg monarchy led by the Prince Eugene of Savoy defeated the forces of the Ottomans led by the Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha. Habsburg forces led by Prince Eugene later defeated the Ottomans at Belgrade before the Ottomans sued for peace at Požarevac.

During the Habsburg administration, Petrovaradin was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Slavonian general command - Petrovaradin regiment). In 1848–49, the town was part of Serbian Vojvodina, but in 1849, it was returned under the administration of the Military Frontier. With the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1881, the town was included into the Syrmia County of Croatia-Slavonia, which was the autonomous kingdom within Austria-Hungary.

In 1918, the town firstly became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, then part of the Kingdom of Serbia and finally part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia). Between 1918 and 1922, the town was part of the Syrmia County, between 1922 and 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast, and between 1929 and 1941 part of the Danube Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. From 1918 to 1936, Yugoslav Royal Air Force was based in Petrovaradin. During World War II (1941–1944), the town was occupied by the Axis Powers and it was attached to the Independent State of Croatia. Since the end of the war in this part of Yugoslavia in 1944, the town was part of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, which from 1945 was part of the new socialist Serbia within socialist Yugoslavia.

==Settlements and neighborhoods==
Neighborhoods and parts of Petrovaradin are: Petrovaradin Fortress, Podgrađe Tvrđave (which is a fortified part of Petrovaradin and part of Petrovaradin Fortress complex), Stari Majur (which is part of Petrovaradin where offices of Petrovaradin local community are located), Novi Majur, Bukovački Plato (Bukovački Put), Sadovi, Široka Dolina, Širine, Vezirac, Trandžament, Ribnjak, Mišeluk, Alibegovac, Radna Zona Istok, Marija Snežna (Radna Zona Istok), and Petrovaradinska Ada (Ribarska Ada).

Between 2002 and 2019, Petrovaradin had a status of separate municipality within the city of Novi Sad, but its administrative bodies were never established and the status was mostly formal. Apart from the town, the municipality covered the area on the right Danube bank: town of Sremska Kamenica; and villages of Stari Ledinci, Novi Ledinci and Bukovac, with some 34,000 residents in total. The municipality status was terminated by a City Assembly decision in 2019.

==Demographics==

In 1961 Petrovaradin had 8,408 inhabitants; in 1971 10,477; in 1981 10,338; in 1991 11,285; and in 2002 13,973. By city&#x27;s registry estimation, from mid-2005, Petrovaradin town had 15,266 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
;Municipality
According to the 2011 census, the total population of the territory of present-day Petrovaradin municipality was 33,865, of whom 27,328 (80.69%) were ethnic Serbs. All settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.

;Town
During the Ottoman administration, Petrovaradin was mostly populated by Muslims, while some Serbs lived there as well in the Christian quarter. According to Habsburg census from 1720, inhabitants of Petrovaradin mostly had German and Serbo-Croatian names and surnames. During the subsequent period of the Habsburg administration and in the first part of the 20th century, the largest ethnic group in the Petrovaradin town were ethnic Croats. According to the 1910 census the town had 5,527 residents, of which 3,266 spoke Croatian (59.09%), 894 German (16.18%), 730 Serbian (13.21%), 521 Hungarian (9.43%) and 159 Slovak (2.88%). Since 1971 census, largest ethnic group in Petrovaradin are Serbs. Today, there are a couple of neighborhoods with sizable number of Croats in Petrovaradin, like Stari Majur and Podgrađe Tvrđave.

==Politics==
Between 1980 and 1989, Petrovaradin was a municipality within the city of Novi Sad. From 1989 to 2002, Novi Sad&#x27;s municipalities were abolished and territory of the former Petrovaradin municipality was part of &quot;Novi Sad municipality&quot;, which included the whole territory of the present-day City of Novi Sad. The city municipalities of Novi Sad were formally re-established in 2002, with Petrovaradin as the second one, since it was a requirement to obtain a city status at the time. In 2007, after the update of the law of local government, the requirement for multiple municipalities for city status was lifted (and 20 additional cities were proclaimed). However, the renewed 2008 city statute also foresaw formation of two separate municipalities, but they have never been established, and the whole city was run solely by the city administration. Petrovaradin only has a local community office. In March 2019, a new city statute was adopted, abolishing any separate municipalities.

<text>The Rhaetian Railway (; ; ), abbreviated RhB, is a Swiss transport company that owns the largest network of all private railway operators in Switzerland. Headquartered in Chur, the RhB operates all the railway lines of the Swiss canton of Grisons, except for the line from Sargans to the cantonal capital, Chur, which are operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), as well as the line from Disentis/Mustér to the Oberalp Pass and further on to Andermatt, Uri, which is operated by Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB). Inaugurated in 1888 and expanded from 1896 onwards in various sections, the RhB network is located almost entirely within Grisons, with one station across the Italian border at Tirano.

The Rhaetian Railway serves a number of major tourist destinations, such as St. Moritz and Davos. One of the RhB lines, the Bernina Railway, crosses the Bernina Pass at above sea level and runs down to Tirano, Lombardy in Italy.

In 2008, the RhB section from the Albula/Bernina area (the part from Thusis to Tirano, including St. Moritz) was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Albula-Bernina line is the first rail line in the world to be photographed and put on Google Street View. The line also operates several historic trains on the network.

==History==

The establishment of the Rhaetian Railway traces back to Dutch Willem Jan Holsboer, who owned a hotel in Davos. He proposed a railway line from Landquart to Davos in 1888. Holsboer founded the Landquart-Davos AG to begin construction of a standard-gauge line, but the mountainous terrain lacked sufficient space. On 29 June 1888, a ground-breaking ceremony took place for a narrow-gauge railway instead. By 1890, the railway line served Davos.

In 1895, Holsboer changed his company&#x27;s name to the Rhaetian Railway () to reflect his plans for network expansion. By 1896 the lines Chur–Landquart and Chur–Thusis were operated. In 1897, a referendum was held for the Rhaetian Railway to bid on operations of the Graubünden/Grisons State Railways.

This was followed by the Albula line in 1903 and the series of expansion projects carried on until 1922. In 1903 the Album line reached Celerina, and in 1904 also St.Moritz was able to be served. During the years 1907 to 1910, the Rhaetian Railway, in collaboration with the federal and cantonal governments, undertook a large-scale expansion of its network.

All RhB lines are wide and electrified:
* (the Bernina Railway from St Moritz to Tirano) is electrified at 1000 V DC.
* is electrified at 11 kV 16.7 Hz (including since 1997 Chur-Arosa and the new Vereina tunnel).

The network contains 84 tunnels (the longest being the Vereina Tunnel, opened on 19 November 1999, and the Albula Tunnel) and 383 bridges. The maximum gradient is 7% on the Bernina railway, 6% on the Chur–Arosa line and 4.5% on Landquart–Davos line.

In 2022, to celebrate the 175th anniversary of Switzerland&#x27;s first railway, the Rhaetische Bahn, supported by Swiss train-builder Stadler, came together to run the world&#x27;s longest-ever passenger train, composed of 100 cars stretching almost two kilometres long.

==Network==

The Rhaetian Railway operates a 385-kilometre-long railway network with 10 railway lines and 102 stations.

In 2002 the annual traffic carried by the RhB was 300 million passenger-kilometres and 54 million tonne-kilometres of freight. 80% of the passenger income comes from tourist traffic, although 40% of passengers are local commuters.

===Current lines===
====Landquart–Davos line====
Landquart railway station in Graubünden is the starting point of the Rhaetian Railway, historically as part of the Landquart-Davos line, operationally as the company&#x27;s main workshop, and topologically as the 0 kilometre point of the company&#x27;s core network. The Landquart-Davos line is the oldest in the Rhaetian Railway network.

After leaving Landquart, the line to Davos generally follows the river Landquart upstream as far as Klosters Platz. Along the way, it crosses the river three times and passes by the award-winning Sunniberg Bridge, the centerpiece of the Klosters bypass road.

Just south of Klosters Platz, the tracks cross the river the last time and come to two tunnels. One of these is for the Vereina line (see below). The other, the Klosters loop tunnel, takes the Davos line through a 90-degree loop towards the west. The line to Davos begins to climb at 4.5% gradient and then loops 180 degrees back towards the east, inside the Cavadürli loop tunnel. It continues to climb through dense larch and other coniferous forests to the Davos Laret.

The highest point on the line is the next stop, Davos Wolfgang at . Then the line leads back down and along Lake Davos to Davos Dorf, and the terminus at Davos Platz.

====Davos–Filisur line====

The connecting line from Davos Platz to the Albula Railway at Filisur passes through wild gorges, and is technically very interesting, not only due to its famous Wiesen Viaduct.

The Davos–Filisur line is long, runs through 14 tunnels extending a total of in length, and crosses 28 bridges. It was electrified in 1919.

====Landquart–Thusis line====
Starting in the Rhine valley, the Landquart-Thusis line runs more or less parallel with the Swiss Federal Railways&#x27; Sargans-Landquart-Chur standard gauge line as far as Chur (elevation ). The line to Thusis then simply follows the course of the Rhine to Bonaduz (). From there, it enters the Domleschg Valley and follows the Posterior Rhine from Rhäzüns () to Thusis ().

====Albula line (Thusis–St. Moritz)====
This line begins in Thusis (elevation ). It continues toward Tiefencastel () following the Albula and then crosses the Landwasser Viaduct before arriving at Filisur (). Shortly after Filisur the line passes its first spiral tunnel then continues to Bergün/Bravuogn ().

Between Bergün/Bravuogn and Preda (), at the end of the valley, the line has to achieve a difference in height of about within a horizontal distance of , without using rack-and-pinion, but with many spirals. Then the line enters the Albula Tunnel at 1,815 metres under the Albula Pass. It emerges in the Val Bever, where it reaches Bever () on the Engadin plain. The line continues toward Samedan () and arrives at St. Moritz ().

In 2009 it was announced that an examination of the Albula Tunnel conducted in 2006 had found major degradation of the tunnel, with over 60% of the lining in need of replacement. Furthermore, the bores are small by modern standards, and cabling, signalling and drainage all need replacement. As a result, it was announced that an inquiry would decide between two options for action: a comprehensive renewal of the existing tunnel, or the construction of a new bore to modern standards. As a result of this inquiry, RhB decided to build a new tunnel. Construction began in 2015, with the new tunnel opening in 2022 and the project completed including refurbishment of the old tunnel in 2023.

====Samedan–Pontresina line====
====Reichenau–Disentis/Mustér line====
The Reichenau to Disentis/Mustér line links the rest of the Rhaetian Railway network with the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn. It branches from the line to Thusis behind the shared Rhine bridge.

The line, which was opened progressively between 1903 and 1912, has been electrified since 1922.

In contrast with the accompanying road, which rises about towards Flims and Laax, the railway to Disentis/Mustér runs slowly up the narrow &quot;Ruinaulta gorge&quot;. On this part of the line, its associated engineering structures dominate the otherwise pristine natural landscape.

At Ilanz, the railway line and road merge paths once again. Their combined pathways then rise slowly and evenly to Disentis/Mustér.

The main traffic on the Reichenau–Disentis/Mustér line is RegioExpress passenger trains operating at hourly intervals. Several times a day, there are Glacier Express trains in each direction.

Timetabled goods trains also operate on the line to serve industry in the Vorderrhein area and supplied cement for the construction of the normal gauge Gotthard Base Tunnel with train IDs starting with 5. Usually three pairs of trains serve Disentis/Mustér with a Ge 6/6 II and a few additional trains go only to Ilanz with a Ge 4/4 II.

====Engadin line (Pontresina–Scuol-Tarasp)====
This line, which runs up the Engadin valley, was constructed in two stages. The Samedan–Pontresina section was opened on by the Rhaetian Railway on 1 July 1908, simultaneously with the Pontresina–Morteratsch section, which formed part of the then-independent Bernina Railway. The actual Engadine line, between Bever and Scuol-Tarasp, was opened on 1 July 1913, and was the first Rhaetian Railway line to be electrified from the start at 11 kV 16⅔ Hz AC.

Since the opening of the Engadin line, Pontresina has been a dual system station, as the Bernina Railway operates on 1,000 V DC. Track 3 at Pontresina station has a switchable catenary, and is used for trains, such as the &quot;Heidi Express&quot;, operating through the station and needing to change from one of the two electification systems to the other.

Between Samedan and Bever, the Engadin line shares its track with the Albula Railway. With the opening of the Vereina Tunnel and line in November 1999, the Engadin line, at both Lavin (Sagliains car shuttle train station) and Susch (Sasslatsch II car shuttle train station), acquired a direct connection to the Prättigau at Klosters, on the Landquart–Davos line.

====Bernina line (St. Moritz–Tirano)====
This line begins at St.Moritz and runs towards Pontresina (elevation ) in Val Bernina. It ascends progressively through the valley to the Bernina Pass over the Morteratsch station () (with the Morteratsch Glacier and Piz Bernina, the highest summit of the Eastern Alps, in sight). After Morteratsch, the line runs towards Bernina Diavolezza (), where an aerial tramway leads to Diavolezza, and Ospizio Bernina station. This station, next to Lago Bianco, stands at the line&#x27;s summit at above sea and holds the title of the highest point of the entire Rhetian Railway network and among all adhesion railways in Europe.

Alp Grüm () is the first station to the immediate south of the summit. It is situated above Lago Palü and right below Piz Palü and Palü Glacier. After negotiating many hairpin turns, the line reaches Cavaglia () above Val Poschiavo; after that, the line descends across the valley towards the Swiss Italian-speaking town of Poschiavo ().

After Poschiavo, the line runs next to Lago Poschiavo and calls at Le Prese () and Miralago (). The descent continues towards Brusio (), after which the line runs across the famous spiral bridge, Brusio Viaduct. After the spiral bridge, the line passes through the Swiss border town of Campocologno () before entering Italy at Tirano RhB station ().

====Arosa line (Chur–Arosa)====

The railway line from Chur to Arosa is known as the (or ), and is often abbreviated as &quot;ChA&quot; (Chur-Arosa). Work began in 1912 on the route and the line opened on 12 December 1914. The railway leads up from Chur to Arosa (a total climb of ) via a number of tunnels, bridges and other structures, including the Langwieser Viaduct - a structure of national importance. In 1942 the line became part of the RhB company and network; however the line ran on a separate electric system to the remainder of the network until 1997. Before then it was 2400 V DC - now it is 11 kV 16.7 Hz AC. The gauge has always been as per the rest of the RhB network.

It is a single track railway, with the exception of a short double track section along Engadinstrasse in Chur, with a number of passing loops along the route: at all stations with the exception of Chur Stadt (and formerly Sassal), as well as at Chur Sand depot and at Haspelgrube near Arosa. The maximum incline is 6% but there is no rack-and-pinion used.

A short section of the line runs along the streets of Chur and is known as the Chur (&#x27;town railway&#x27;). In Chur, the line starts on Bahnhofplatz, in front of the main railway station, where that station&#x27;s platforms for the Arosabahn are, though there is a second stop in Chur only from the main station.

A tunnel through the Mittenberg had been planned as an alternative route for the lower section of the line, avoiding running through the centre of Chur. This plan was finally dropped in 1996 as the considerable expense could not be justified.

The line is well used by tourists coming to and from the resort at Arosa. The line also carries a substantial amount of freight.

====Vereina line (Klosters–Sagliains/Susch)====
===Former lines===
====Bellinzona–Mesocco line====

This line is not connected to the others. It opened in 1907 and was owned by the Rhaetian Railway between 1942 and 2003. Passenger services ceased in 1972, but a limited freight traffic continued until 2003. The private association (SEFT, Società Esercizio Ferroviario Turistico) operated it as a heritage railway for tourists over of the original of line until part of the concession was withdrawn in 2013 to allow road construction. The road construction had been started in July 2014.
===Passenger services===

The RhB operates regular InterRegio (IR), RegioExpress (RE), and Regio (R) services, as well as the Chur S-Bahn. In addition, two Panorama Express (PE) services are operated on the Rhaetian Railway network, namely the
* Bernina Express (Chur / St. Moritz – Tirano),
* Glacier Express (Zermatt – Andermatt – Chur – St. Moritz),
of which the former is operated by the RhB, and the latter is jointly owned and operated by the RhB and the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn.

The regular daytime passenger services (as of December 2024) are as follows:

==Rolling stock==

For commuter services Rhaetian Railway ABe 4/16 electric multiple units are used.

Apart from the normal passenger coaches and the panoramic coaches used for the branded &quot;Bernina Express&quot; tourist services, the railway attaches to the back of trains, according to need:
* yellow open trucks with wooden benches called 
* art deco Pullman coach AS 1143, which may be hired by private parties

==Corporate information==
===Statistics===
* Travellers per year (2008): 10.7 million
* Revenue (2008): 308,700,000 sFr.
* Profit (2008): 1,700,000 sFr.

===Ownership===
The RhB is 51.3% owned by the Cantonal government of Graubünden, 43.1% by the Swiss Confederation, 4.6% by private shareholders and 1% by a collection of local communities.

The RhB has its headquarters at Bahnhofstrasse 25, Chur. 

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 13 August 2014, a passenger train was struck by a landslide and derailed at Tiefencastel, Graubünden, on the Albula Railway. Eleven people were injured.

==In popular culture==
In 1997, the Rhaetian Railway was used as the prototype for the Nord Express in the 20th Century Fox animated motion picture &quot;Anastasia&quot;. Not only was the Rhaetian Railway featured in the film, but several landmarks were also included: the Landwasser Viaduct and a 1912 Mittelthurgau-Bahn Ec 3/5 Class 2-6-2 tank locomotive No. 3 with an added tender. This 1912 locomotive was portrayed as a Russian continental steam locomotive (fictional). It was modified with the smoke deflectors and the smoke-box door from a Danish State Railways Class R 963. The locomotive&#x27;s fictitious number being used in the movie was 2747, as this was a reference to the address of the Fox Animation Studios on East Camelback Road in Phoenix, Arizona. The Landwasser Viaduct was portrayed as a tall, 4-storey viaduct in Poland as a type of Roman aqueducts.

<text>The Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway (, , abbreviated MOB) is a company that operates an electrified railway line, the Montreux–Lenk im Simmental line, in southwest Switzerland, one of the oldest electric railways in the country. Its main line, in length, is built to the gauge. It connects Montreux, Gstaad, and Zweisimmen. At Zweisimmen, passengers may transfer to the Zweisimmen to Spiez line — a standard gauge line owned by BLS AG. A branch-line also connects Zweisimmen to Lenk.

== History and route ==
The main line of the MOB was opened in stages, the first, from Montreux to Les Avants () on 17 December 1901, followed by the Les Avants to Montbovon () section on 1 October 1903. The next stages from Montbovon to Château-d&#x27;Œx () and then Gstaad () followed on 19 August 1904 and 20 December 1904 respectively, the final of the line reaching Zweisimmen on 6 July 1905. The spur line to Lenk was opened in 1912.
From the very start, the MOB had the character of a mainline railway and, at an early stage, through trains with dining and saloon coaches were introduced. The creation of the &quot;Golden Mountain Pullman Express&quot; in 1931 was unfortunately at a time of world economic crisis and this accounted for its lack of success. The saloon coaches 103–106 built for this train by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) were sold to the Rhaetian Railway in 1939, where they are still in use (As 1141–44). Two of the original (1913–14 built) coaches have been restored by the MOB and are used for &quot;Chocolate train&quot; services in the summer months, but still regularly find work on the main line &quot;Classic train&quot; services on Sundays throughout the year. The modern successor of this luxury train is the &quot;Golden Pass Panoramic Express&quot;, which for the past few years has aroused growing enthusiasm.
The MOB begins its journey in Montreux, departing trains normally making use of platform 5 and arrivals platform 6, between the Swiss Federal Railway platforms and those of the rack and pinion railway to the Rochers de Naye. Winding its way up through the vineyards above Lake Geneva via Chamby, as far as Les Avants, the line passes through the crown tunnel under the Col de Jaman to reach the Saane Valley. In Montbovon there is a connection to the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF; previously GFM) network. Following the Saane upstream, passing the famous hot-air ballooning centre of Château-d&#x27;Oex, it leaves the French-speaking canton of Vaud near Rougemont and enters the German-speaking canton of Bern. After Saanen the planners would have liked a direct ascent of the Saanenmöser Pass but without the aid of a rack and pinion system this was impossible and the line was diverted to loop around the village of Gstaad, adding greatly to the development and prosperity of the community. Beyond Gstaad railway station it begins the climb to the head of Saanenmöser Pass, the highest point on the line at 1,270 m (3,937 ft). On the other side it descends the Simmen Valley to Zweisimmen, where there is a connection to the standard gauge line of the BLS to Spiez.

Over the years, while passenger traffic boomed, freight traffic diminished with 2006 seeing the end of cement transport between Montreux and Saanen and the transport of standard gauge wagons on transporter bogies between Zweisimmen and stations to Rougemont and Lenk. By the end of the year the MOB was a passenger only operation, however in Spring 2007 the company purchased nine gravel (hopper) wagons and two surplus locomotives from the TPF. The MOB now operates this transport from Grandvillard (on the TPF line) to Saanen.

The Lenk branch retraces this route for a very short distance before continuing on its own trackbed. Because of its poor state of repair, this line was closed on 14 June 1975, however, it was fully modernized between 1977 and 1979, having new tracks and overhead lines, reopening on 27 September 1979. New rolling stock was purchased (* in the list below) to operate this line together with the weekdays school service between Zweisimmen and Saanen. Since reopening it has been included in the regular operating schedule of the MOB with timetabled connections to the main line services. To celebrate the centenary of the opening of the Lenk line (June 2012), the MOB arranged a week of festivities with a dinner, special fares and operation and display of rolling stock usually to be found on museum lines, particularly that at Blonay–Chamby Museum Railway.

== Modernisation program ==
In spring 2008, the MOB announced a four-year plan to modernise the railway infrastructure and rebuild stations to bring them all into the 21st century. This programme began with the demolition of little-used facilities: the goods shed in Gstaad and the shed in Château-d&#x27;Œx, this latter structure being replaced by a free-standing shelter, for example. During 2008, much work took place on the overhead line equipment, with replacement supports being positioned along the line. Although not brought into use, they stand ready for the new wiring. It is expected that this work will continue up to four nights per week through to December 2009, subject to weather conditions. New deeper ballasting has taken place along many sections of the line and this will be continued until the line has all been done.

The work at Gstaad consisted of a complete rebuilding of the platforms to full height and simplification of the track layout. After almost 100 years the station received platform canopies and passenger-operated lifts linked by a pedestrian underpass. During this rebuilding the station was reduced to a single line. The canopy is of wooden construction supported on metal uprights. The new layout gives the original platform as No.1 with the new island platform being Nos. 2 and 3. This work was officially opened, if not fully finished, on 13 June 2009.

At Saanenmöser station, a straightforward relaying and alignment took place through late 2008 to early 2009, which maintained the passing and siding facility at that location.

During the early part of 2010, by the end of May, the stations underwent a rebranding along with those of other lines which come under the &quot;Golden Pass&quot; banner. All were fitted with signs bearing the new &quot;Golden Pass&quot; logo and name alongside the station nameboards, which were retained in their original colours.

One of the smallest stations and halts (Les Combes, between Château-d&#x27;Œx and Rougemont) was given a new raised platform during Autumn 2011, leaving only the waiting shelter as original.

Work commenced on the rebuilding of Château-d&#x27;Œx station in mid–September 2013 and plans were published in the local newspaper with details of the work, which was carried out in three phases and completed by the end of 2014. Throughout the work, the passing-loop facility was maintained and raised platforms constructed, reached by subways from the station front. Construction work was delayed and the station officially reopened on 28 November 2015.

== Timetables and train formations ==

From the beginning of the 2011 timetable, there are two Golden Pass Panoramic services with VIP domed observation cars, departing Montreux at 9:45 (Train 3118) and 15:45,(Train Nos 2128); the Lenk branch ceases to be served, the &quot;through&quot; working only lasting one year (2010). It is normally made up in the following formation and operate in the &quot;push–pull&quot; mode:
* Ast / Brs / As / Locomotive / BDs / Bs* / Arst* : This is the length limit of the train due to platform lengths. Trains may be shorter off-season.

In the reverse direction, the Golden Pass trains with VIP seating are the 12:26 (Train 2119) and 18:20 from Zweisimmen (Train 2131).

There are other Golden Pass trains without VIP seating (dome end cars) and these depart Montreux at 7:h45, 11:49, 14:47 and 17:45 (Trains 2112, 2124, 2228 and 2134) and from Zweisimmen at 8:26, 10:26, 14:26 and 17:05 (Trains 2111, 3115, 3123 and 2229). These trains are locomotive hauled and use stock not required for the trains with VIP seating. The formation, which is flexible, is usually as follows:
* Locomotive / As / As / BDs / Bs / Bs
This leaves a surplus of one domed observation car (two in use on the Golden Pass panorama and one on the &quot;Chocolate Train&quot;)
Golden Pass Classic trains operate daily departing Montreux at 8:47 and 13:45 (Trains 2216 and 3126), returning from Zweisimmen at 11:09 and 16:26 (Trains 2217 and 2127) and are made up in the following formation:
* Locomotive / As / As / Brs / Bs / Non-Classic Type BD (to provide cycle / luggage space)
The Golden Pass &quot;Chocolate Train&quot; operates in June, September and October every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and in July and August Monday to Friday, departing Montreux at 9:12 (Train 2118) but no return working is shown in the timetable. Until the end of the 2008 season, it was made up in the following formation which ran throughout between Montreux and Broc Fabrique:
* Locomotive / Belle Époque Ars / Belle Époque As / Other vehicles as required (usually Panorama type and/or Non-Classic type BD).

In the 2009 timetable the formation was changed and operated between Montreux and Gruyere only with a coach connection to Broc (due to operating problems), as follows: 
* Locomotive (Usually 6003 &quot;Saanen&quot;, in special &quot;Chocolate Train&quot; livery) / Belle Epoque Ars / Belle Epoque Ars / Golden Pass Panorama observation car (No. 116 or 117) operating in Push – Pull mode.

Other trains Montreux–Zweisimmen may be pulled by a Ge 4/4, GDe 4/4 or an ABDe 8/8 and they can have up to five coaches.

Local services operate connecting Montreux to Fontanivent (Mon – Fri ), Chernex, Sonzier and Les Avants, operated by Be 2/6 7001–7004 and from Château-d&#x27;Oex, Saanen or Gstaad to Zweisimmen. The branch-line from Zweisimmen to Lenk offers a regular service timetabled to connect into and out of the MOB main line services. These trains are operated by Be 4/4 5001–5004.
== Locomotives and motor coaches ==
For decades, the traffic on the MOB was handled by electric motor coaches available in four-, six- and eight-axle designs. In 1983, four locomotives of the type GDe 4/4 were bought, to be followed in 1994 by four newer and more powerful Ge 4/4 locomotives from the same manufacturer. These are similar to the ones purchased by the Rhaetian Railway and BAM. Any of these locomotives can be seen working the principal trains.

In December 2006, the TPF relinquished its freight operations to the SBB Cargo, and its two GDe 4/4 locomotives became surplus to requirements. In April 2007, these were purchased by the MOB and have since been allocated numbers following on from those of their new owners.

The MOB is run with 900 V DC overhead contact and has gradients of up to 7.3% (1 in 13.5).

Withdrawn and Preserved Items

Note 1: Class Be 4/4 after rebuild operate as the centre-car (non driving motor) of a three-car set made up as Bt – BDe4/4 – ABt. The Bt vehicles are numbered 241 – 244 and the ABt vehicles 341 – 344. Bt242 carries R+J Builders plate 70671 – 2005.

Note 2: Class Be 2/6, No&#x27;s 7001 to 7004, are listed under the stock owned by the Chemins de fer électriques Veveysans (CEV) but they also work short journeys over the MOB from Montreux to Fontanivent, Sonzier and Les Avants.

Note 3: These units operate in pairs [ie xx02 + xx03] with coaches between-

== Livery ==
In 2009, a decision was made to change the livery on all rolling stock except for the Golden Pass Panorama and Golden Pass Classic trains. This was to include the various railways and funiculars marketed under the &quot;Golden Pass&quot; banner and the buses operated by the company. The colour scheme is to be a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) with all stock being rebranded &quot;Golden Pass&quot;. The new colours will be applied to the stock as it passes through works, although the &quot;Golden Pass&quot; logo will be applied as soon as practicable. The first vehicle to be reliveried, First / Second Composite Coach AB307, appeared in traffic on 27 August 2010 (1).

== Passenger rolling stock ==
The passenger carrying rolling stock can be divided into the categories: &quot;Classic&quot;, &quot;Panoramic&quot;, &quot;Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Saanenland&quot;.

===Classic stock===
&quot;Classic&quot; stock are six Pullman type coaches, two from 1914 and four rebuilt in 2004–06 on structures from 1964. Details are as follows:
*Type Ars : &quot;Belle Epoque&quot;, First Class saloon built in 1914, No. 101. Along with As 102 this normally works as part of the &quot;Chocolate Train&quot; formation.
*Type As : &quot;Belle Epoque&quot;, First Class saloon with 36 seats, built in 1914, No. 102. This coach served as prototype for the CIWL coaches and also for the rebuilds of 2004–06. Along with Ars 101 this is normally to be found in the &quot;Chocolate Train&quot; formation.
*Type As : Pullman Saloon Car, First Class Nos. 103 and 107. Built in 1964 and rebuilt in 2004/05, Air Conditioned. No. 103 has 36 seats, No. 107 has 38.
*Type Brs : Second Class Pullman &quot;Cave Car&quot; (Buffet), No. 201. Built in 1964 and rebuilt in 2005 with air conditioning and seats for 47 passengers.
*Type Bs : Second Class Pullman Saloon Car, No. 202. Built in 1964 and rebuilt in 2006 with air conditioning and seats for 56 passengers.

===Panoramic stock===
&quot;Panoramic&quot; stock is that used on the &quot;Golden Pass Panoramic&quot; services and includes the observation vehicles used at each end of train when the locomotive is centrally situated. Most &quot;panoramic&quot; coaching stock has been built by the former Biel-based coach work builder Ramseier+Jenzer. All coaches are air conditioned.
These include:
*Type As : First Class saloon coach, Nos. 110, 111, 112, 114, built 1976–83 and 118–119, built 1992–93. These coaches were originally seated 2+2 but since been changed to 2+1, reducing their seating capacity to 33. Coach No. 110 was the last of these coaches to carry the dark blue and cream livery and have the 2+2 seating. It entered Chernex workshops in early May 2008 for rebuilding and returned to service at the end of September.
*Type Ast : First Class Observation Car, Nos. 116 (named &quot;Lausanne&quot;) and 117 (named &quot;Château-d&#x27;Oex&quot;), built 1985–86. These vehicles have 8 seats in the &quot;Observation Dome&quot;, now facing Montreux.
*Type Arst: First Class Observation Car, Nos., 151 and 152, built in 1993 by Breda. With a seating capacity of 27 plus 8 seats within the &quot;Observation Dome&quot;, now facing Zweisimmen.
*Type Bs : Second Class saloon, Nos. 251 and 252, built in 1993 by Breda as As 153–154. With a seating capacity of 48. These coaches were nearly identical to those delivered to FO and BVZ, now Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB).
*Type Bs : Second Class saloon, Nos. 222, 223, built 1982 and 226, 227 built 1989.
*Type BDs : Second Class saloon with disabled compartment and wheelchair lift, Nos. 220 (a), 224 and 225, built 1979–83, rebuilt 2001–02.
*Type Brs : Second Class buffet, Nos. 221 and 228, built 1979 and 1985 (as Ars 115) and rebuilt 1987/95.

Note (a). BDs No. 220 was outshopped from Chernex in late June 2010, following a press demonstration the previous month, as the first vehicle to be fitted on axle-less, dual gauge bogies to be tested for readiness for the route running to Interlaken.

==Ordinary stock==
The &quot;Ordinary&quot; stock is used on all services not operated by the Panoramic and Classic coaches. These are painted in a light blue and cream livery and can be hauled by locomotives or railcars. They also include driving trailers (&quot;Voiture pilote&quot;). These are
* Type ABt : Driving Trailer Composite, Nos. 5301 to 5304. Withdrawn and rebuilt with new bodies and bogies by R+J / Raility, renumbered 341 to 344 as part of &quot;Saanenland&quot; sets 5001 to 5004 inc. (See Below)
* Type ABDt: Driving Trailer Composite with guards/luggage compartment, No. 3301 (At July 2009 working with 3001 in Engineers Dept. use).

===Saanenland stock===
&quot;Saanenland&quot; stock is specially liveried for work over the Zweisimmen to Lenk line and local services between Zweisimmen and Saanen. The stock works in conjunction with motor vehicles of type Be 4/4, Nos. 5001–4 and these sets are usually worked as fixed formations of Bt-Be 4/4-ABt, the first being ready for traffic in 2004 was 243-5003-343. 244-5004-344 followed in 2006 and 242-5002-342 left Chernex works for traffic on 20 August 2008. The final unit, No. 241 – 5001 – 341 left Chernex on 7 July 2009 and was seen in Zweissimann two days later having worked a service from Montreux. The driving trailers that replaced ABt 5301-04 are:
* Type Bt : Second class driving trailer, Nos. 241 to 244.
* Type ABt: First / Second Composite driving trailer, Nos. 341 to 344.
x43 and x44 were built by Ramseier+Jenzer and fitted with SIG-type bogies, x41 and x42 are built by Raility, the successor company of R+J, and will receive Alstom Centro 1000 bogies with air suspension on delivery.

=== New stock on order ===

On 22 June 2007, the MOB gave details to the press that it had placed orders with Raility of Biel for eight new air-conditioned coaches with large panoramic windows and low-floor access and seating. The coaches will have standard-level seating at the vestibule ends, with a central section of low-floor seating containing the access doors which will assist those with restricted mobility. They will also contain handicapped-accessible toilets. The coaches will be fitted with a new type of bogie &quot;Centro 1000&quot; incorporating air suspension, produced by Alstom. The first of these, number Bs230, was delivered from Chernex works into traffic during mid-May 2010. The livery is white all over with the lettering in gold showing the new &quot;golden pass&quot; symbol and lettered &quot;Transgoldenpass&quot;. The blue lettering &quot;bls&quot; is also featured. The second coach is expected to be ready for traffic in June 2010. Four of the new coaches will be put between the two halves of ABDe 8/8 4001–4004, forming three-car-EMUs.

The first of these to enter full revenue–earning service did so in mid-December 2010 when 231 and 232 were formed as a regular part of the &quot;Golden Pass Panorama&quot; trains 3118/2119/2128/2131

== Variable gauge bogies ==
On 18 May 2010, MOB invited press and officials to demonstrate the first Panoramic coach (BDs 220) fitted with variable gauge bogies to allow through running across the / break-of-gauge. The axle-less bogie was developed by MOB and engineered by Prose company of Winterthur. Some components were designed for the Centro 1000 bogie and built by Alstom. Apart from changing the gauge, the bogies also adjust the height of the coaches to suit the different platform heights on the two gauges. MOB announced commercial service with variable gauge trains for 2015. The date of commercial through running Montreux to Interlaken has been postponed several times. Delays in manufacturing due to COVID-19 have been cited in 2020 and 2021. In spring 2021 launch date was set to 11 December 2022.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 3 January 2018, one of three carriages of a train was blown off the tracks in high winds at Lenk. Eight people were injured.

<doc id="224248" wikidata="Q834211" url="?curid=224248" title="Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem">
<text>In geometry, the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem, named after William Wallace, Farkas Bolyai and P. Gerwien, is a theorem related to dissections of polygons. It answers the question when one polygon can be formed from another by cutting it into a finite number of pieces and recomposing these by translations and rotations. The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem states that this can be done if and only if two polygons have the same area.

Wallace had proven the same result already in 1807.

According to other sources, Bolyai and Gerwien had independently proved the theorem in 1833 and 1835, respectively.

== Formulation ==
There are several ways in which this theorem may be formulated. The most common version uses the concept of &quot;equidecomposability&quot; of polygons: two polygons are equidecomposable if they can be split into finitely many triangles that only differ by some isometry (in fact only by a combination of a translation and a rotation). In this case the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem states that two polygons are equidecomposable if and only if they have the same area.

Another formulation is in terms of scissors congruence: two polygons are scissors-congruent if they can be decomposed into finitely many polygons that are pairwise congruent. Scissors-congruence is an equivalence relation. In this case the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem states that the equivalence classes of this relation contain precisely those polygons that have the same area.

== Proof sketch ==
The theorem can be understood in a few steps. Firstly, every polygon can be cut into triangles. There are a few methods for this. For convex polygons one can cut off each vertex in turn, while for concave polygons this requires more care. A general approach that works for non-simple polygons as well would be to choose a line not parallel to any of the sides of the polygon and draw a line parallel to this one through each of the vertices of the polygon. This will divide the polygon into triangles and trapezoids, which in turn can be converted into triangles.

Secondly, each of these triangles can be transformed into a right triangle and subsequently into a rectangle with one side of length 1. Alternatively, a triangle can be transformed into one such rectangle by first turning it into a parallelogram and then turning this into such a rectangle. By doing this for each triangle, the polygon can be decomposed into a rectangle with unit width and height equal to its area.

Since this can be done for any two polygons, a &quot;common subdivision&quot; of the rectangle in between proves the theorem. That is, cutting the common rectangle (of size 1 by its area) according to both polygons will be an intermediate between both polygons.

== Notes about the proof ==
First of all, this proof requires an intermediate polygon. In the formulation of the theorem using scissors-congruence, the use of this intermediate can be reformulated by using the fact that scissor-congruences are transitive. Since both the first polygon and the second polygon are scissors-congruent to the intermediate, they are scissors-congruent to one another.

The proof of this theorem is constructive and doesn&#x27;t require the axiom of choice, even though some other dissection problems (e.g. Tarski&#x27;s circle-squaring problem) do need it. In this case, the decomposition and reassembly can actually be carried out &quot;physically&quot;: the pieces can, in theory, be cut with scissors from paper and reassembled by hand.

Nonetheless, the number of pieces required to compose one polygon from another using this procedure generally far exceeds the minimum number of polygons needed.

== Degree of decomposability ==
Consider two equidecomposable polygons &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. The minimum number &quot;n&quot; of pieces required to compose one polygon &quot;Q&quot; from another polygon &quot;P&quot; is denoted by σ(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;).

Depending on the polygons, it is possible to estimate upper and lower bounds for σ(&quot;P&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;). For instance, Alfred Tarski proved that if &quot;P&quot; is convex and the diameters of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are respectively given by d(&quot;P&quot;) and d(&quot;Q&quot;), then
:formula_1
If &quot;Px&quot; is a rectangle of sides &quot;a&quot;·&quot;x&quot; and &quot;a&quot;·(1/&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;Q&quot; is a square of side length &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;Px&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are equidecomposable for every &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0. An upper bound for σ(&quot;Px&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;) is given by
:formula_2
Since σ(&quot;Px&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;) = σ(&quot;P&quot;(1/&quot;x&quot;),&quot;Q&quot;), we also have that
:formula_3

== Generalisations ==
The analogous statement about polyhedra in three dimensions, known as Hilbert&#x27;s third problem, is false, as proven by Max Dehn in 1900. The problem has also been considered in some non-Euclidean geometries. In two-dimensional hyperbolic and spherical geometry, the theorem holds. However, the problem is still open for these geometries in three dimensions.

<text>The Jungfrau Railway (, , JB) is a mountain rack railway in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, connecting Kleine Scheidegg in the Bernese Oberland to the Jungfraujoch, across the Valais border. It is the highest railway in Switzerland and Europe, running from the station of Kleine Scheidegg () to the Jungfraujoch (), well above the perennial snow line. As a consequence, the railway runs essentially within the Jungfrau Tunnel, built into the neighbouring Eiger and Mönch, to protect the line from snow and extreme weather.

The Jungfrau Railway got its name from the highest of the three high peaks above it: the Jungfrau (; ), which was the initial goal of the project. A lift connecting the summit of the Jungfrau with an underground railway was planned. In 1912, the project ultimately ended at the Jungfraujoch, the saddle between the Mönch and Jungfrau. It was one of the highest railways in the world at the time of its inauguration.

At Kleine Scheidegg the Jungfrau Railway connects with the Wengernalpbahn (WAB), which has two routes down the mountain, running respectively to the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. From both villages, branches of the Berner Oberland-Bahn (BOB) connect to the Swiss Federal Railways at Interlaken.

The line is owned by the &quot;Jungfraubahn AG&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Jungfraubahn Holding AG&quot;, a holding company that owns several mountain railways, cable railways, hotels, restaurants and travel agencies in the same region. Through that holding company it is part of the &quot;Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn.

==History==

*1860 (approximately) – Many different plans for a mountain railway on the Jungfrau exist, but fail due to financial problems.
*1894 – The industrialist Adolf Guyer-Zeller receives a concession for a rack railway, which begins from the Kleine Scheidegg railway station of the Wengernalpbahn (WAB), with a long tunnel through the Eiger and Mönch up to the summit of the Jungfrau.
*1896 – Construction begins. Construction work proceeds briskly.
*1898 – The Jungfrau Railway opens as far as the Eigergletscher railway station, at the foot of the Eiger.
*1899 – Six workers are killed in an explosion. There is a four-month strike by workers. Adolf Guyer-Zeller dies in Zürich on 3 April. The section from Eigergletscher station to Rotstock station opens on 2 August.
*1903 – The section from Rotstock station to Eigerwand station opens on 28 June.
*1905 – The section from Eigerwand station to Eismeer station opens on 25 July.
*1908 – There is an explosion at Eigerwand station.
*1912 – On 21 February, sixteen years after work commenced, the tunneling crew finally breaks through the glacier in Jungfraujoch. Jungfraujoch station is inaugurated on 1 August.
*1924 – &quot;The house above the clouds&quot; at Jungfraujoch is opened on 14 September.
*1931 – The research station at the Jungfraujoch is opened.
*1937 – The Sphinx Observatory is opened. A snowblower is purchased, resulting in year-round operation.
*1942 – Company offices are relocated from Zürich to Interlaken.
*1950 – The dome is installed on the Sphinx Observatory.
*1951 – The adhesion section between Eismeer station and Jungfraujoch station is converted to rack operation.
*1955 – A second depot at Kleine Scheidegg is constructed. The post office inaugurates its relay station on the Jungfraujoch.
*1972 – The panoramic windows are installed at Eigerwand and Eismeer. The Jungfraujoch mountain house and tourist house are destroyed by fire on 21 October.
*1975 – A new tourist house is opened.
*1987 – A new mountain house is opened on 1 August.
*1991 – A new station hall is opened at the Jungfraujoch.
*1993 – The small Kleine Scheidegg depot is extended.
*1996 – The covered observation deck at the Sphinx Observatory is opened.
*1997 – The number of annual visitors exceeds 500,000 for the first time.
*2000 – On 1 June, a daily record number of 8,148 visitors is achieved.
*2016 – Eigerwand station is closed.

==Operations==
The Jungfrau Railway has four operational stations, a previous station at having closed in 2016. The base station hub of Kleine Scheidegg is the highest starting point for a railroad in Europe, and the top terminus of Jungfraujoch is the highest railway station in Europe. The initial open-air section culminates just after Eigergletscher station, at around 2,350 metres, which makes the line the second highest open-air railway in Switzerland. The other station is , located in the Jungfrau Tunnel, where passengers travelling towards Jungfraujoch can disembark for a short time to observe the neighbouring mountains through windows built into the east face of the Eiger, overlooking the Eismeer (the &quot;sea of ice&quot;).

Additional locations along the line include Rotstock Station, at , which was closed in 1903, and Stollenloch, a person-sized tunnel-opening which exits directly onto the north face of the Eiger.

=== Characteristics ===

The line uses a and uses a Strub rack.

The Jungfrau Railway is electrified and one of only four lines in the world with three-phase electric power. The line runs using a 3-phase alternating current (AC) system which requires the trains to collect power from twin overhead wires using two pantographs (the third phase is earthed to the track).

=== Lift proposal and aerial cableway ===
In early 2008, Jungfraubahn Holding AG announced it was exploring the idea of an efficient fast form of access to the Jungfraujoch, using the world&#x27;s longest tunnel-lift system, as an alternative to the rack railway. A feasibility study was undertaken to determine if and how such a system—for example, as a fast lift or funicular—from the Lauterbrunnen Valley to the Jungfraujoch could be realised without disturbing the unique landscape of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. These plans were abandoned and in 2017 the company announced plans to build an aerial cableway between , a new station on the Interlaken-Grindelwald line, and from where the Jungfrau railway could be joined for the journey to the summit. This aerial cableway, known as the Eiger Express, opened to the public on 5 December 2020 and provides an alternative, faster way to access the Jungfraujoch from the valley.

==Rolling stock==

Since most of the railway is inside a tunnel, it was designed to be powered by electricity from conception. The current rolling stock consists of twin-unit motorcoaches carrying up to 230 people per train which operate at on the steepest parts of the ascent. The motors function at two speeds which allows the units to operate at double this speed on the less steep part of the ascent (above Eismeer station).

The motors operate in a regenerative mode which allows the trains to generate electricity during the descent, which is fed back into the power distribution system. Approximately 50% of the energy required for an ascent is recovered during the descent. This generation regulates the descent speed.

Motive power delivered since 1992 (numbers 211–224) no longer has directly-fed three-phase motors but is equipped similarly to a normal single-phase locomotive. This rolling stock can travel at variable speeds, which enabled a reduction in journey time from 52 to 35 min with the timetable starting 11 December 2016. Pre-1992 rolling stock can no longer be used in regular traffic and most of the earlier trains have been scrapped.

Snow clearing equipment is essential on the open section of line between Kleine Scheidegg railway station and Eigergletscher railway station. Originally snow ploughs were used, but more recently snow blowing equipment has been brought into service.

The railway also operates some dedicated freight vehicles to supply the visitor facilities at Jungfraujoch, including a tank to transport additional water.

<text>The Wengernalp Railway (, WAB) is a long rack railway line in Switzerland. It runs from Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald via Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg, making it the world&#x27;s longest continuous rack and pinion railway. The name refers to the alpine meadow of Wengernalp, above Wengen.

The line is normally operated in two sections, with trains from either direction terminating at Kleine Scheidegg. At the latter station, most passengers transfer to the Jungfrau Railway for the continuation of the journey to the highest railway station in Europe at Jungfraujoch. There are generally no roads to Wengen and Mürren, and the train is the principal means of access.

The line is owned by the &quot;Wengernalpbahn AG&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Jungfraubahn Holding AG&quot;, a holding company that also owns the Jungfraubahn and Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen–Mürren, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn. Through that holding company it is part of the &quot;Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe&quot; marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Berner Oberland-Bahn and Schynige Platte-Bahn.

==History==

In 1875, the first plans for a railway on the route later taken by the Wengernalp line were drawn up, but the high projected costs meant that the concession expired. Fifteen years later, in 1890, Leo Heer-Bétrix gained a new 80-year concession to build and operate the railway. The Wengernalpbahn was founded.

Construction work commenced in 1891, and the following year the first steam locomotive reached Wengen on 18 April and Kleine Scheidegg on 10 August. The full length of the line, from Lauterbrunnen to Grindelwald, opened on 20 June 1893 as a summer only service.

The electrification of the line between Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg was completed on 3 June 1909 using 1500 V DC, with electric locomotives positioned, for safety reasons, at the lower end of the trains. The section between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg followed on 24 June 1910. Steam operation ceased in 1912.

On 7 July 1910, a new route, longer but less steep, was opened between Lauterbrunnen to Wengen. The older route was retained for nearly a hundred more years, being finally decommissioned and dismantled in 2009 because of the steep gradient of 25% and concern over geological stability on parts of the route.

In 1913, winter operations commenced between Lauterbrunnen to Kleine Scheidegg, followed by year round operations over the same section in 1925. Winter operations between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg started in 1934, followed by year round operations in 1960.

In 1942, the headquarters of the railway moved from Zürich to Interlaken. In 1947, the first motorcoaches were purchased. The following year the partly underground turning triangle at Kleine Scheidegg was constructed.

In 1990, an avalanche shelter was built on the Lauterbrunnen side of the operation, whilst in 1995 Wengen station was rebuilt to include a freight delivery terminal. In 2005, Wengernalp station platforms were extended from 127 m to 181 m usable length. In 2011, a new double track loop was opened between Wengen and Allmend, allowing the introduction of a clock-face timetable between Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg.

== Operations ==


The line is built to 800 mm gauge ( gauge), and uses the Riggenbach rack system, as modified by Arnold Pauli. Modern stock uses Strub rack system.

Nowadays, most passenger trains are made up of railcars, the powered car still being positioned at the lower end of the train, and so train compositions do not usually cross Kleine Scheidegg to travel directly from Lauterbrunnen over to Grindelwald. However, a triangular junction specially built into the mountainside at Kleine Scheidegg allows the train to be turned if necessary so that it can also be used on the other side of the col. The newest of these trains reach 28 km/h on the steepest stretch.

At peak periods, additional trains can be put into operation at short intervals ahead of the scheduled train, allowing capacity to be optimised according to demand. This demands an extremely flexible organisation procedure and enormous care and attention with regard to dispatching trains. Since most of the line is single track, the extra trains display a green disk with a diagonal white line on the front to indicate to station staff and signal operators that there is a train following in the same direction

The busiest stretch of railway runs from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen as this is also used to transport goods to traffic-free Wengen.

The railway operates two workshops at Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald Grund.

=== Stations ===
The line serves the following stations:
* Lauterbrunnen
* Wengwald
* Wengen
* Allmend
* Wengernalp
* Kleine Scheidegg
* Alpiglen
* Brandegg
* Grindelwald Grund
* Grindelwald

=== Timetables ===
A regular interval timetable is operated between Grindelwald and Kleine Scheidegg with trains running every half-hour morning and afternoon, except between late October and mid December when the service is hourly. Journey time is 33 minutes up and 39 minutes down.

Between Lauterbrunnen and Wengen, trains run all year every half-hour until early evening, followed by an hourly service. During mornings and afternoons they continue to Kleine Scheidegg, again half-hourly except between late October and mid December when the service is hourly. Journey time is 43 minutes up and 50 minutes down.

Before December 2011, the Lauterbrunnen - Wengen - Kleine Scheidegg service was formed of 5 trains running at irregular intervals in every 2-hour period. Journey times varied between 44 and 51 minutes up and 54 and 60 minutes down.
Following the construction of the new loop between Wengen and Allmend, the number of trains in each direction has been reduced from 5 to 4 in each 2-hour period, but departure and journey times have been standardised.

Between December and March, extra trains are run on some evenings between Grindelwald and Alpiglen to carry passengers to the floodlit Eiger Run sledging course.

== Rolling stock==

=== Locomotives ===

=== Railcars ===
The earliest railcars still in service, numbers 101 and 102 ( BDhe 4/4, built by SLM/BBC ) date from 1947, No.102 being refurbished 1985. Of the other 14 cars of this class, No&#x27;s. 104 and 106–118, built between 1954 and 1964, which still survive, ten have been refurbished (all except 104 / 7 / 9 / 10) since 2000. No. 114 was refurbished along with 102 in 1985 but was returned to works in 2002 to be brought up to the newer specifications.

In 1970 a new class of railcar ( BDhe 4/4 ) was introduced, numbered 119 to 124, built by a consortium of SIG, SLM, SAAS and BBC. These were refurbished in 1998. Four further cars, class BDhe 4/8, numbered 131 to 134, and built by SLM ( Works Nos. 5363–66 inclusive ) with electrical equipment by BBC, arrived in 1988 with the latest additions, a series of four &quot;Panorama&quot; cars of Class Bhe 4/8, built by Stadler arriving in 2004.

=== Driving trailer cars ===

The earliest coaches still listed to the company are three dating from 1893 and a single example from 1901. These have all been rebuilt twice, the final one in 1995 by the von Roll company. Later examples date from the period 1959 to 2003, some of the earlier of these have rebuilt. Building of the stock has been carried out by SIG, with electrical equipment by Brown Boveri / Asea Brown Boveri and later by Stadler with electrical equipment by Steck, (except No. 231 which was built by SLM with electrical equipment by ABB).

The line also operates with an extensive collection of goods stock, in the main used for services between Lauterbrunnen and Wengen.

<text>The Mir Castle Complex (; ; ; ) is a historic fortified castle and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Belarus. It is located in the town of Mir, in Karelichy District of Grodno Oblast, north-west of another World Heritage site, Nesvizh Castle. Mir Castle Complex is above sea level. Erected in the 16th century in the late Brick Gothic style, it is one of the few remaining architectural monuments of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in contemporary Belarus.

==History==

Duke began construction of the castle near the village of Mir after the turn of the 16th century in the Belarusian Gothic style. Five towers surrounded the courtyard of the citadel, the walls of which formed a square of on each side. In 1568, when the Ilyinich dynasty died out, the Mir Castle passed into the hands of Mikalaj Kryštafor &quot;the Orphan&quot; Radziwil, who refitted it with a two-winged, three-story stately residence along the eastern and northern inner walls of the castle. Plastered facades were decorated with limestone portals, plates, balconies and porches in the Renaissance style.
In 1817, after the castle had been abandoned for nearly a century and had suffered severe damage in the Battle of Mir (1812), owner Daminik Hieranim Radziwil died of battle injuries and the castle passed to his daughter Stefania, who married Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. Later the castle became a possession of their daughter Maria, who married Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst.

Their son, Maurice Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, sold the castle to Mikalaj Sviatapolk-Mirski, of the Bialynia clan, in 1895. Mikalaj&#x27;s son Michail began to rebuild the castle according to the plans of architect Teodor Bursche. The Sviatapolk-Mirski family owned the castle until 1939, when the Soviet Union occupied Western Belarus.

When German forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, they occupied the castle and converted it to a ghetto for the local Jewish population, prior to their murders. Between 1944 and 1956, the castle was used as a housing facility, resulting in damage to the castle&#x27;s interior.

In December 2000, the Mir Castle was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

<text>In Western music theory, a chord is a group of notes played together for their harmonic consonance or dissonance. The most basic type of chord is a triad, so called because it consists of three distinct notes: the root note along with intervals of a third and a fifth above the root note. Chords with more than three notes include added tone chords, extended chords and tone clusters, which are used in contemporary classical music, jazz, and other genres.

Chords are the building blocks of harmony and form the harmonic foundation of a piece of music. They provide the harmonic support and coloration that accompany melodies and contribute to the overall sound and mood of a musical composition. The factors, or component notes, of a chord are often sounded simultaneously but can instead be sounded consecutively, as in an arpeggio.

A succession of chords is called a chord progression. One example of a widely used chord progression in Western traditional music and blues is the 12 bar blues progression. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords are more common in Western music, and some patterns have been accepted as establishing the key (tonic note) in common-practice harmony—notably the resolution of a dominant chord to a tonic chord. To describe this, Western music theory has developed the practice of numbering chords using Roman numerals to represent the number of diatonic steps up from the tonic note of the scale.

Common ways of notating or representing chords in Western music (other than conventional staff notation) include Roman numerals, the Nashville Number System, figured bass, chord letters (sometimes used in modern musicology), and chord charts.

==Definition==
The English word &quot;chord&quot; derives from Middle English &quot;cord&quot;, a back-formation of &quot;accord&quot; in the original sense of &quot;agreement&quot; and later, &quot;harmonious sound&quot;. A sequence of chords is known as a chord progression or harmonic progression. These are frequently used in Western music. A chord progression &quot;aims for a definite goal&quot; of establishing (or contradicting) a tonality founded on a key, root or tonic chord. The study of harmony involves chords and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them.

Ottó Károlyi writes that, &quot;Two or more notes sounded simultaneously are known as a chord,&quot; though, since instances of any given note in different octaves may be taken as the same note, it is more precise for the purposes of analysis to speak of distinct &quot;pitch classes&quot;. Furthermore, as three notes are needed to define any common chord, three is often taken as the minimum number of notes that form a definite chord. Hence, Andrew Surmani, for example, states, &quot;When three or more notes are sounded together, the combination is called a chord.&quot; George T. Jones agrees: &quot;Two tones sounding together are usually termed an &quot;interval&quot;, while three or more tones are called a &quot;chord&quot;.&quot; According to Monath, &quot;a chord is a combination of three or more tones sounded simultaneously&quot;, and the distances between the tones are called intervals. However, sonorities of two pitches, or even single-note melodies, are commonly heard as &quot;implying&quot; chords. A simple example of two notes being interpreted as a chord is when the root and third are played but the fifth is omitted. In the key of C major, if the music stops on the two notes G and B, most listeners hear this as a G major chord.

Since a chord may be understood as such even when all its notes are not simultaneously audible, there has been some academic discussion regarding the point at which a group of notes may be called a &quot;chord&quot;. Jean-Jacques Nattiez explains that, &quot;We can encounter &#x27;pure chords&#x27; in a musical work&quot;, such as in the &quot;Promenade&quot; of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; but, &quot;often, we must go from a textual given to a more &quot;abstract&quot; representation of the chords being used&quot;, as in Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Première arabesque&quot;.
== History ==
In the medieval era, early Christian hymns featured organum (which used the simultaneous perfect intervals of a fourth, a fifth, and an octave), with chord progressions and harmony - an incidental result of the emphasis on melodic lines during the medieval and then Renaissance (15th to 17th centuries).

The Baroque period, the 17th and 18th centuries, began to feature the major and minor scale based tonal system and harmony, including chord progressions and circle progressions. It was in the Baroque period that the accompaniment of melodies with chords was developed, as in figured bass, and the familiar cadences (perfect authentic, etc.). In the Renaissance, certain dissonant sonorities that suggest the dominant seventh occurred with frequency. In the Baroque period, the dominant seventh proper was introduced and was in constant use in the Classical and Romantic periods. The leading-tone seventh appeared in the Baroque period and remains in use. Composers began to use nondominant seventh chords in the Baroque period. They became frequent in the Classical period, gave way to altered dominants in the Romantic period, and underwent a resurgence in the Post-Romantic and Impressionistic period.

The Romantic period, the 19th century, featured increased chromaticism. Composers began to use secondary dominants in the Baroque, and they became common in the Romantic period. Many contemporary popular Western genres continue to rely on simple diatonic harmony, though far from universally: notable exceptions include the music of film scores, which often use chromatic, atonal or post-tonal harmony, and modern jazz (especially ), in which chords may include up to seven notes (and occasionally more). When referring to chords that do not function as harmony, such as in atonal music, the term &quot;sonority&quot; is often used specifically to avoid any tonal implications of the word &quot;chord&quot;.

Chords are also used for timbre effects. In organ registers, certain chords are activated by a single key so that playing a melody results in parallel voice leading. These voices, losing independence, are fused into one with a new timbre. The same effect is also used in synthesizers and orchestral arrangements; for instance, in Ravel’s &quot;Bolero&quot; #5 the parallel parts of flutes, horn and celesta, being tuned as a chord, resemble the sound of an electric organ.

==Notation==
Chords can be represented in various ways. The most common notation systems are:

# Plain staff notation, used in classical music
#Roman numerals, commonly used in harmonic analysis to denote the scale step on which the chord is built.
#Figured bass, much used in the Baroque era, uses numbers added to a bass line written on a staff, to enable keyboard players to improvise chords with the right hand while playing the bass with their left.
#Chord letters, sometimes used in modern musicology, to denote chord root and quality.
# Various chord names and symbols used in popular music lead sheets, fake books, and chord charts, to quickly lay out the harmonic ground plan of a piece so that the musician may improvise, jam, or vamp on it.

===Roman numerals===
While scale degrees are typically represented in musical analysis or musicology articles with Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., sometimes with a circumflex above the numeral: , , , ...), the triads (three-note chords) that have these degrees as their roots are often identified by Roman numerals (e.g., I, IV, V, which in the key of C major would be the triads C major, F major, G major).

In some conventions (as in this and related articles) upper-case Roman numerals indicate major triads (e.g., I, IV, V) while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads (e.g., I for a major chord and i for a minor chord, or using the major key, ii, iii and vi representing typical diatonic minor triads); other writers (e.g., Schoenberg) use upper case Roman numerals for both major and minor triads. Some writers use upper-case Roman numerals to indicate the chord is diatonic in the major scale, and lower-case Roman numerals to indicate that the chord is diatonic in the minor scale. Diminished triads may be represented by lower-case Roman numerals with a degree symbol (e.g., vii7 indicates a diminished seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C major, this chord would be B diminished seventh, which consists of the notes B, D, F and A).

Roman numerals can also be used in stringed instrument notation to indicate the position or string to play. In some string music, the string on which it is suggested that the performer play the note is indicated with a Roman numeral (e.g., on a four-string orchestral string instrument, I indicates the highest-pitched, thinnest string and IV indicates the lowest-pitched, thickest bass string). In some orchestral parts, chamber music and solo works for string instruments, the composer tells the performer which string to use with the Roman numeral. Alternately, the composer starts the note name with the string to use—e.g., &quot;sul G&quot; means &quot;play on the G string&quot;.

===Figured bass notation===
Figured bass or thoroughbass is a kind of musical notation used in almost all Baroque music ( 1600–1750), though rarely in music from later than 1750, to indicate harmonies in relation to a conventionally written bass line. Figured bass is closely associated with chord-playing basso continuo accompaniment instruments, which include harpsichord, pipe organ and lute. Added numbers, symbols, and accidentals beneath the staff indicate the intervals above the bass note to play; that is, the numbers stand for the number of scale steps above the written note to play the figured notes.

For example, in the figured bass below, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above (F and A) should be played, giving the second inversion of the F major triad.

If no numbers are written beneath a bass note, the figure is assumed to be , which calls for a third and a fifth above the bass note (i.e., a root position triad).

In the 2010s, some classical musicians who specialize in music from the Baroque era can still perform chords using figured bass notation; in many cases, however, the chord-playing performers read a fully notated accompaniment that has been prepared for the piece by the music publisher. Such a part, with fully written-out chords, is called a &quot;realization&quot; of the figured bass part.
===Chord letters===
Chord letters are used by musicologists, music theorists and advanced university music students to analyze songs and pieces. Chord letters use upper-case and lower-case letters to indicate the roots of chords, followed by symbols that specify the chord quality.

===Notation in popular music===
In most genres of popular music, including jazz, pop, and rock, a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more parts. In these genres, chord-playing musicians in the rhythm section (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, Hammond organ, etc.) typically improvise the specific &quot;voicing&quot; of each chord from a song&#x27;s chord progression by interpreting the written chord symbols appearing in the lead sheet or fake book. Normally, these chord symbols include:
* A (big) letter indicating the root note (e.g., C).
* A symbol or abbreviation indicating the chord quality (e.g., minor, aug or ). If no chord quality is specified, the chord is assumed to be a major triad by default.
* Number(s) indicating the stacked intervals above the root note (e.g., 7 or 13).
* Additional musical symbols or abbreviations for special alterations (e.g., 5, 5 or add13).
* An added slash &quot;/&quot; and an upper case letter indicates that a bass note other than the root should be played. These are called &quot;slash chords&quot;. For instance, C/F indicates that a C major triad should be played with an added F in the bass. In some genres of modern jazz, two chords with a slash between them may indicate an advanced chord type called a polychord, which is the playing of two chords simultaneously. The correct notation of this should be , which sometimes get mixed up with slash chords.

Chord qualities are related with the qualities of the component intervals that define the chord. The main chord qualities are:
* Major and minor (a chord is &quot;Major&quot; by default and altered with added info: &quot;C&quot; = C major, &quot;Cm&quot; = c minor).
* augmented, diminished, and half-diminished,
* dominant seventh.

====Symbols====
The symbols used for notating chords are:
* m, min, or − indicates a minor chord. The &quot;m&quot; must be lowercase to distinguish it from the &quot;M&quot; for major.
* M, Ma, Maj, , or (no symbol) indicates a major chord. In a jazz context, this typically indicates that the player should use any suitable chord of a major quality, for example a major seventh chord or a 6/9 chord. In a lot of jazz styles, an unembellished major triad is rarely if ever played, but in a lead sheet the choice of which major quality chord to use is left to the performer.
* + or aug indicates an augmented chord (A or a is not used).
* or dim indicates a diminished chord, either a diminished triad or a diminished seventh chord (d is not used).
* indicates a half-diminished seventh chord. In some fake books, the abbreviation m7(5) is used as an equivalent symbol.
* 2 is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add2, sus2).
* 3 is the minor or major quality of the chord and is rarely written as a number.
* 4 is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add4, sus4).
* 5 is the (perfect) fifth of the chord and is only written as a number when altered (e.g., F7(5)). In guitar music, like rock, a &quot;5&quot; indicates a power chord, which consists of only the root and fifth, possibly with the root doubled an octave higher.
* 6 indicates a sixth chord. There are no rules if the 6 &quot;replaces&quot; the 5th or not.
* 7 indicates a dominant seventh chord. However, if Maj7, M7 or 7 is indicated, this is a major 7th chord (e.g., GM7 or FΔ7). Very rarely, also dom is used for dominant 7th.
* 9 indicates a ninth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh as well, if it is a dominant chord.
* 11 indicates an eleventh chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh and ninth as well, if it is a dominant chord.
* 13 indicates a thirteenth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh, ninth and eleventh as well.
* 6/9 indicates a triad with the addition of the sixth and ninth.
* sus4 (or simply 4) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the fourth used instead. Other notes may be added to a sus4 chord, indicated with the word &quot;add&quot; and the scale degree (e.g., Asus4(add9) or Asus4(add7)).
* sus2 (or simply 2) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the second (which may also be called the ninth) used instead. As with &quot;sus4&quot;, a &quot;sus2&quot; chord can have other scale degrees added (e.g., Asus2(add7) or Asus2(add4)).
* (9) (parenthesis) is used to indicate explicit chord alterations (e.g., A7(9)). The parenthesis is probably left from older days when jazz musicians weren&#x27;t used to &quot;altered chords&quot;. Albeit important, the parenthesis can be left unplayed (with no &quot;musical harm&quot;).
* add indicates that an additional interval number should be added to the chord. (e.g., C7add13 is a C 7th chord plus an added 13th).
* alt or alt dom indicates an altered dominant seventh chord (e.g., G711).
* omit5 (or simply no5) indicates that the (indicated) note should be omitted.

==== Examples ====
The table below lists common chord types, their symbols, and their components.

====Use====
The basic function of chord symbols is to eliminate the need to write out sheet music. The modern jazz player has extensive knowledge of the chordal functions and can mostly play music by reading the chord symbols only. Advanced chords are common especially in modern jazz. Altered 9ths, 11ths and 5ths are not common in pop music. In jazz, a chord chart is used by comping musicians (jazz guitar, jazz piano, Hammond organ) to improvise a chordal accompaniment and to play improvised solos. Jazz bass players improvise a bassline from a chord chart. Chord charts are used by horn players and other solo instruments to guide their solo improvisations.

Interpretation of chord symbols depends on the genre of music being played. In jazz from the bebop era or later, major and minor chords are typically realized as seventh chords even if only &quot;C&quot; or &quot;Cm&quot; appear in the chart. In jazz charts, seventh chords are often realized with upper extensions, such as the ninth, sharp eleventh, and thirteenth, even if the chart only indicates &quot;A7&quot;. In jazz, the root and fifth are often omitted from chord voicings, except when there is a diminished fifth or an augmented fifth.

In a pop or rock context, however, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;Cm&quot; would almost always be played as triads, with no sevenths. In pop and rock, in the relatively less common cases where songwriters wish a dominant seventh, major seventh, or minor seventh chord, they indicate this explicitly with the indications &quot;C7&quot;, &quot;Cmaj7&quot; or &quot;Cm7&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Within the diatonic scale, every chord has certain characteristics, which include:
* the number of pitch classes (distinct notes without respect to octave) in the chord,
* the scale degree of the root note,
*the position or inversion of the chord,
* the general type of intervals it is constructed from—for example, seconds, thirds, or fourths, and
* counts of each pitch class as occurring between all combinations of notes the chord contains.

===Number of notes===
Two-note combinations, whether referred to as chords or intervals, are called &quot;dyads&quot;. In the context of a specific section in a piece of music, dyads can be heard as chords if they contain the most important notes of a certain chord. For example, in a piece in C Major, after a section of tonic C Major chords, a dyad containing the notes B and D sounds to most listeners as a first inversion G Major chord. Other dyads are more ambiguous, an aspect that composers can use creatively. For example, a dyad with a perfect fifth has no third, so it does not sound major or minor; a composer who ends a section on a perfect fifth could subsequently add the missing third. Another example is a dyad outlining the tritone, such as the notes C and F# in C Major. This dyad could be heard as implying a D7 chord (resolving to G Major) or as implying a C diminished chord (resolving to Db Major). In unaccompanied duos for two instruments, such as flute duos, the only combinations of notes that are possible are dyads, which means that all of the chord progressions must be implied through dyads, as well as with arpeggios.

Chords constructed of three notes of some underlying scale are described as &quot;triads&quot;. Chords of four notes are known as &quot;tetrads&quot;, those containing five are called &quot;pentads&quot; and those using six are &quot;hexads&quot;. Sometimes the terms &quot;trichord&quot;, &quot;tetrachord&quot;, &quot;pentachord&quot;, and &quot;hexachord&quot; are used—though these more usually refer to the pitch classes of any scale, not generally played simultaneously. Chords that may contain more than three notes include pedal point chords, dominant seventh chords, extended chords, added tone chords, clusters, and polychords.

Polychords are formed by two or more chords superimposed. Often these may be analysed as extended chords; examples include tertian, altered chord, secundal chord, quartal and quintal harmony and Tristan chord. Another example is when G7(119) (G–B–D–F–A–C) is formed from G major (G–B–D) and D major (D–F–A). A nonchord tone is a dissonant or unstable tone that lies outside the chord currently heard, though often resolving to a chord tone.

===Scale degree===

In the key of C major, the first degree of the scale, called the &quot;tonic&quot;, is the note C itself. A C major chord, the major triad built on the note C (C–E–G), is referred to as the &quot;one chord&quot; of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I. The same C major chord can be found in other scales: it forms chord III in the key of A minor (A→B→C) and chord IV in the key of G major (G→A→B→C). This numbering indicates the chords&#x27;s function.

Many analysts use lower-case Roman numerals to indicate minor triads and upper-case numerals for major triads, and &quot;degree&quot; and &quot;plus&quot; signs ( and ) to indicate diminished and augmented triads respectively. Otherwise, all the numerals may be upper-case and the qualities of the chords inferred from the scale degree. Chords outside the scale can be indicated by placing a flat/sharp sign before the chord—for example, the chord E major in the key of C major is represented by III. The tonic of the scale may be indicated to the left (e.g., &quot;F:&quot;) or may be understood from a key signature or other contextual clues. Indications of inversions or added tones may be omitted if they are not relevant to the analysis. Roman numeral analysis indicates the root of the chord as a scale degree within a particular major key as follows.

===Inversion===
In the harmony of Western art music, a chord is in &quot;root position&quot; when the tonic note is the lowest in the chord (the bass note), and the other notes are above it. When the lowest note is not the tonic, the chord is &quot;inverted&quot;. Chords that have many constituent notes can have many different inverted positions as shown below for the C major chord:

Further, a four-note chord can be inverted to four different positions by the same method as triadic inversion. For example, a G7 chord can be in root position (G as bass note); first inversion (B as bass note); second inversion (D as bass note); or third inversion (F as bass note).
Where guitar chords are concerned, the term &quot;inversion&quot; is used slightly differently; to refer to stock fingering &quot;shapes&quot;.
===Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords===

Many chords are a sequence of notes separated by intervals of roughly the same size. Chords can be classified into different categories by this size:
* Tertian chords can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) thirds. For example, the C major triad (C–E–G) is defined by a sequence of two intervals, the first (C–E) being a major third and the second (E–G) being a minor third. Most common chords are tertian.
* Secundal chords can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) seconds. For example, the chord C–D–E is a series of seconds, containing a major second (C–D) and a minor second (D–E).
*Quartal chords can be decomposed into a series of (perfect or augmented) fourths. Quartal harmony normally works with a combination of perfect and augmented fourths. Diminished fourths are enharmonically equivalent to major thirds, so they are uncommon. For example, the chord C–F–B is a series of fourths, containing a perfect fourth (C–F) and an augmented fourth/tritone (F–B).

These terms can become ambiguous when dealing with non-diatonic scales, such as the pentatonic or chromatic scales. The use of accidentals can also complicate the terminology. For example, the chord B–E–A appears to be quartal, as a series of diminished fourths (B–E and E–A), but it is enharmonically equivalent to (and sonically indistinguishable from) the tertian chord C–E–G, which is a series of major thirds (C–E and E–G).

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a chord form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in combination. A 3-note chord has 3 of these harmonic intervals, a 4-note chord has 6, a 5-note chord has 10, a 6-note chord has 15. The absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the chord, and sometimes of the selection of the chord that follows.

A chord containing tritones is called &quot;tritonic&quot;; one without tritones is &quot;atritonic&quot;. Harmonic tritones are an important part of dominant seventh chords, giving their sound a characteristic tension, and making the tritone interval likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord. Tritones are also present in diminished seventh and half-diminished chords.

A chord containing semitones, whether appearing as minor seconds or major sevenths, is called &quot;hemitonic&quot;; one without semitones is &quot;anhemitonic&quot;. Harmonic semitones are an important part of major seventh chords, giving their sound a characteristic high tension, and making the harmonic semitone likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord. A chord containing major sevenths but no minor seconds is much less harsh in sound than one containing minor seconds as well.

Other chords of interest might include the
*Diminished triad, which has many minor thirds and no major thirds, many tritones but no perfect fifths
*Augmented triad, which has many major thirds and no minor thirds or perfect fifths
*Dominant seventh flat five chord, which has many major thirds and tritones and no minor thirds or perfect fifths

==Common types of chords==
===Triads===

Triads, also called &quot;triadic chords&quot;, are tertian chords with three notes. The four basic triads are described below.

===Seventh chords===
Seventh chords are tertian chords, constructed by adding a fourth note to a triad, at the interval of a third above the fifth of the chord. This creates the interval of a seventh above the root of the chord, the next natural step in composing tertian chords. The seventh chord built on the fifth step of the scale (the dominant seventh) is the only dominant seventh chord available in the major scale: it contains all three notes of the diminished triad of the seventh and is frequently used as a stronger substitute for it.

There are various types of seventh chords depending on the quality of both the chord and the seventh added. In chord notation the chord type is sometimes superscripted and sometimes not (e.g., Dm7, Dm7, and Dm7 are all identical).

===Extended chords===

Extended chords are triads with further tertian notes added beyond the seventh: the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords. For example, a minor eleventh chord such as Am11 consists of the notes A–C–E–G–B–D:
The upper structure or extensions, i.e., notes beyond the seventh, are shown here in red. This chord is just a theoretical illustration of this chord. In practice, a jazz pianist or jazz guitarist would not normally play the chord all in thirds as illustrated. Jazz voicings typically use the third, seventh, and then the extensions such as the ninth and thirteenth, and in some cases the eleventh. The root is often omitted from chord voicings, as the bass player will play the root. The fifth is often omitted if it is a perfect fifth. Augmented and diminished fifths are normally included in voicings.
After the thirteenth, any notes added in thirds duplicate notes elsewhere in the chord; all seven notes of the scale are present in the chord, so adding more notes does not add new pitch classes. Such chords may be constructed only by using notes that lie outside the diatonic seven-note scale.

Other extended chords follow similar rules, so that for example maj9, maj11, and maj13 contain major seventh chords rather than dominant seventh chords, while m9, m11, and m13 contain minor seventh chords.

===Altered chords===
The third and seventh of the chord are always determined by the symbols shown above. The root cannot be so altered without changing the name of the chord, while the third cannot be altered without altering the chord&#x27;s quality. Nevertheless, the fifth, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth may all be chromatically altered by accidentals.

These are noted alongside the altered element. Accidentals are most often used with dominant seventh chords. Altered dominant seventh chords (C7alt) may have a minor ninth, a sharp ninth, a diminished fifth, or an augmented fifth. Some write this as C7+9, which assumes also the minor ninth, diminished fifth and augmented fifth. The augmented ninth is often referred to in blues and jazz as a blue note, being enharmonically equivalent to the minor third or tenth. When superscripted numerals are used the different numbers may be listed horizontally or vertically.

===Added tone chords===
An added tone chord is a triad with an added, non-tertian note, such as an added sixth or a chord with an added second (ninth) or fourth (eleventh) or a combination of the three. These chords do not include &quot;intervening&quot; thirds as in an extended chord. Added chords can also have variations. Thus, madd9, m4 and m6 are minor triads with extended notes.

Sixth chords can belong to either of two groups. One is first inversion chords and added sixth chords that contain a sixth from the root. The other group is inverted chords in which the interval of a sixth appears above a bass note that is not the root.

The major sixth chord (also called, sixth or added sixth with the chord notation 6, e.g., C6) is by far the most common type of sixth chord of the first group. It comprises a major triad with the added major sixth above the root, common in popular music. For example, the chord C6 contains the notes C–E–G–A. The minor sixth chord (min6 or m6, e.g., Cm6) is a minor triad, still with a major 6. For example, the chord Cm6 contains the notes C–E–G–A.

The augmented sixth chord usually appears in chord notation as its enharmonic equivalent, the seventh chord. This chord contains two notes separated by the interval of an augmented sixth (or, by inversion, a diminished third, though this inversion is rare). The augmented sixth is generally used as a dissonant interval most commonly used in motion towards a dominant chord in root position (with the root doubled to create the octave the augmented sixth chord resolves to) or to a tonic chord in second inversion (a tonic triad with the fifth doubled for the same purpose). In this case, the tonic note of the key is included in the chord, sometimes along with an optional fourth note, to create one of the following (illustrated here in the key of C major):
*Italian sixth chord: A, C, F
*French sixth chord: A, C, D, F
*German sixth chord: A, C, E, F

The augmented sixth family of chords exhibits certain peculiarities. Since they are not based on triads, as are seventh chords and other sixth chords, they are not generally regarded as having roots (nor, therefore, inversions), although one re-voicing of the notes is common (with the namesake interval inverted to create a diminished third).

The second group of sixth chords includes inverted major and minor chords, which may be called sixth chords in that the six-three () and six-four () chords contain intervals of a sixth with the bass note, though this is not the root. Nowadays, this is mostly for academic study or analysis (see figured bass) but the Neapolitan sixth chord is an important example; a major triad with a flat supertonic scale degree as its root that is called a &quot;sixth&quot; because it is almost always found in first inversion. Though a technically accurate Roman numeral analysis would be II, it is generally labelled N6. In C major, the chord is notated (from root position) D, F, A. Because it uses chromatically altered tones, this chord is often grouped with the borrowed chords but the chord is not borrowed from the relative major or minor and it may appear in both major and minor keys.

===Suspended chords===
A suspended chord, or &quot;sus chord&quot;, is a chord in which the third is replaced by either the second or the fourth. This produces two main chord types: the suspended second (sus2) and the suspended fourth (sus4). The chords, Csus2 and Csus4, for example, consist of the notes C–D–G and C–F–G, respectively. There is also a third type of suspended chord, in which both the second and fourth are present, for example the chord with the notes C–D–F–G.

The name &quot;suspended&quot; derives from an early polyphonic technique developed during the common practice period, in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed, or suspended, by extending the duration of the previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory, the inclusion of the third in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called added ninth and added eleventh chords instead.

In modern lay usage, the term is restricted to the displacement of the third only, and the dissonant second or fourth no longer must be held over (prepared) from the previous chord. Neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all, though in the majority of cases the conventional stepwise resolution to the third is still observed. In post-bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations, suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as V chords and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A good example is the jazz standard, &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;.

Extended versions are also possible, such as the seventh suspended fourth, which, with root C, contains the notes C–F–G–B and is notated as C7sus4. Csus4 is sometimes written Csus since the sus4 is more common than the sus2.

===Borrowed chords===
A borrowed chord is one from a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as Schubert. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major III chord (e.g., an E major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the key of C minor. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, this is not how the term is used when a chord is described in formal musical analysis.

When a chord is analysed as &quot;borrowed&quot; from another key it may be shown by the Roman numeral corresponding with that key after a slash. For example, V/V (pronounced &quot;five of five&quot;) indicates the dominant chord of the dominant key of the present home-key. The dominant key of C major is G major so this secondary dominant is the chord of the fifth degree of the G major scale, which is D major (which can also be described as II relative to the key of C major, not to be confused with the supertonic ii namely D minor.). If used for a significant duration, the use of the D major chord may cause a modulation to a new key (in this case to G major).

Borrowed chords are widely used in Western popular music and rock music. For example, there are a number of songs in E major which use the III chord (e.g., a G major chord used in an E major song), the VII chord (e.g., a D major chord used in an E major song) and the VI chord (e.g., a C major chord used in an E major song). All of these chords are &quot;borrowed&quot; from the key of E minor.

==Bell chord==


A bell chord, also known colloquially as &quot;bells&quot;, is a musical arrangement technique in which a composition has separate instruments (or multiples of the same instrument) play single notes of a chord in sequence, sustaining individual notes to form the chord. It is, in effect, an arpeggio played by several instruments sequentially. This is also known as a &quot;pyramid&quot; or &quot;cascade&quot;. It is common in barbershop music.

The technique originated with jazz big bands and is a staple of trad jazz. A good example can be heard in the introduction to &quot;The Charleston&quot; by The Temperance Seven. &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by the rock band Queen contains two occurrences of this &quot;bell effect&quot; in the middle section, as does the solo in Killer Queen starting at 1:48.

<text>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (often abbreviated PNAS or PNAS USA) is a peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journal. It is the official journal of the National Academy of Sciences, published since 1915, and publishes original research, scientific reviews, commentaries, and letters. According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 9.4. &quot;PNAS&quot; is the second most cited scientific journal, with more than 1.9 million cumulative citations from 2008 to 2018. In the past, &quot;PNAS&quot; has been described variously as &quot;prestigious&quot;, &quot;sedate&quot;, &quot;renowned&quot; and &quot;high impact&quot;.

&quot;PNAS&quot; is a delayed open-access journal, with an embargo period of six months that can be bypassed for an author fee (hybrid open access). Since September 2017, open access articles are published under a Creative Commons license. Since January 2019, &quot;PNAS&quot; has been online-only, although print issues are available on demand.

== History ==
&quot;PNAS&quot; was established by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1914, with its first issue published in 1915. The NAS itself was founded in 1863 as a private institution, but chartered by the United States Congress, with the goal to &quot;investigate, examine, experiment and report upon any subject of science or art.&quot;

Prior to the inception of &quot;PNAS&quot;, the National Academy of Sciences published three volumes of organizational transactions, consisting mostly of minutes of meetings and annual reports. For much of the journal&#x27;s history, &quot;PNAS&quot; published brief first announcements of Academy members&#x27; and associates&#x27; contributions to research. In December 1995, &quot;PNAS&quot; opened submissions to all authors without first needing to be sponsored by an NAS member.

Members were allowed to communicate up to two papers from non-members to &quot;PNAS&quot; every year. The review process for these papers was anonymous in that the identities of the referees were not revealed to the authors. Referees were selected by the NAS member. &quot;PNAS&quot; eliminated communicated submissions through NAS members , while continuing to make the final decision on all &quot;PNAS&quot; papers.

95% of papers are peer reviewed Direct Submissions and 5% are contributed submissions.

In 2022 NAS established &quot;PNAS Nexus&quot;, an interdisciplinary open-access journal published by Oxford Academic.

===American national security concerns===
In 2003, &quot;PNAS&quot; issued an editorial stating its policy on publication of sensitive material in the life sciences. &quot;PNAS&quot; stated that it would &quot;continue to monitor submitted papers for material that may be deemed inappropriate and that could, if published, compromise the public welfare.&quot; This statement was in keeping with the efforts of several other journals. In 2005 &quot;PNAS&quot; published an article titled &quot;Analyzing a bioterror attack on the food supply: The case of botulinum toxin in milk&quot;, despite objections raised by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The paper was published with a commentary by the president of the Academy at the time, Bruce Alberts, titled &quot;Modeling attacks on the food supply&quot;.

===Contributed review concerns===
The controversial Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which evolved directly from pseudoscience and now forms the basis for the pseudoarchaeology of Graham Hancock&#x27;s Ancient Apocalypse, was first published in PNAS using a nonstandard review system, according to a comprehensive refutation by Holliday et al (2023). According to this 2023 review, &quot;Claiming evidence where none exists and providing misleading citations may be accidental, but when conducted repeatedly, it becomes negligent and undermines scientific advancement as well as the credibility of science itself. Also culpable is the failure of the peer review process to prevent such errors of fact from entering the literature. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &#x27;contributed review&#x27; system for National Academy members...is at least partially responsible. The &#x27;pal reviews&#x27; (as some refer to them) were significantly curtailed in 2010, in part due to the YDIH controversy.&quot;

==Editors==
The following people have been editors-in-chief of the journal:

The first managing editor of the journal was mathematician Edwin Bidwell Wilson.

<doc id="224263" wikidata="Q275858" url="?curid=224263" title="Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 9 by Gustav Mahler was written between 1908 and 1909, and was the last symphony that he completed. A typical performance takes about 75 to 90 minutes. A survey of conductors voted Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 9&quot; the fourth greatest symphony of all time in a ballot conducted by &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; in 2016. As in the case of his earlier &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, Mahler did not live to see his Symphony No. 9 performed.

Though the work is often described as being in the key of D major, the tonal scheme of the symphony as a whole is progressive. While the opening movement is in D major, the finale is in D major.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for a large orchestra, consisting of the following:

;Woodwinds
:piccolo
:4 flutes
:4 oboes (4th doubling cor anglais)
:E clarinet
:3 B and A clarinets
:bass clarinet
:4 bassoons (4th doubling contrabassoon)

;Brass
:4 horns
:3 trumpets
:3 trombones
:tuba

;Percussion
:4 timpani
:bass drum
:snare drum
:cymbals
:triangle
:tam-tam
:3 deep bells in F, A, and B
:glockenspiel

;Strings
:2 harps
:1st violins
:2nd violins
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
==Structure==

The symphony is in four movements:

Although the symphony has the traditional number of movements, it is unusual in that the first and last are slow rather than fast. As is often the case with Mahler, one of the middle movements is a ländler.

===I. &quot;Andante comodo&quot;===
The first movement embraces a loose sonata form. The key areas provide a continuation of the tonal juxtaposition displayed in earlier works (notably Symphonies No. 6 and No. 7). The work opens with a hesitant, syncopated rhythmic motif (which Leonard Bernstein suggested is a depiction of Mahler&#x27;s irregular heartbeat), which is heard throughout the movement.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; a4.-&gt;\pp^&quot;Cello&quot; a8 r \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; a4.\p-&gt;^&quot;Horn&quot; } \midi{\tempo 4 = 88} &lt;/score&gt;

The brief introduction also presents two other ideas: a four-note motif announced by the harp that provides much of the musical basis for the rest of the movement,

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;orchestral harp&quot; fis,4-&gt; a-&gt; r b-&gt; | a-&gt; } \midi{\tempo 4 = 88} &lt;/score&gt;

and a muted horn fanfare that is also heard later.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key d \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; « { c4. b8-&gt; bes2-&gt;~ | bes4~ \times 2/3 { bes8 a gis } bes8[ r16 a] gis4~ | gis8 } \\ { &lt;g d&gt;1~\sf | &lt;g d&gt;8 r \times 2/3 { d8 cis c } \times 2/3 { d cis c } &lt;f d&gt;4~ | &lt;f d&gt;8 } » } \midi{\tempo 4 = 88} &lt;/score&gt;

In the development, it is heard in the horns and clarinets in Mahler&#x27;s original form, with a third descending into a fifth. At the height of the development, the trombones and tuba announce the rhythmic heartbeat motif, marked within the score &quot;&quot;Mit höchster Gewalt&quot; (with greatest force). It leads into a solemn funeral march, marked &quot;Wie ein Kondukt&quot;&quot; (like a funeral procession), on a timpani ostinato of the harp&#x27;s four-note motif. Low bells are heard here for the first and only time in the symphony, accompanying the timpani in the four-note motif.

Near the end of the movement is a remarkable example of Mahler&#x27;s linear polyphony, in which piccolo, flute, oboe, and solo violin imitate bird-calls. Alban Berg asserted that this section was a &quot;vision of the hereafter&quot;. Allusions to other music in this movement include references to Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata Op. 81a and to Johann Strauss II&#x27;s waltz &quot;Freuet Euch des Lebens&quot;, the latter first noted by Philip Barford in 1971.

===II. &quot;Im Tempo eines gemächlichen Ländlers. Etwas täppisch und sehr derb&quot;===
The second movement is a series of dances, and opens with a rustic ländler, which becomes distorted to the point that it no longer resembles a dance.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key c \major \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; \partial 4*1 c16-.\p d-. e-. f-. | g8-. r g-. r c,16-. d-. e-. f-. | g8-. r g-. r \clef treble \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot; &lt;e&quot; c g&gt; r | \grace { e16[( f]) } &lt;e c g&gt;4(\sf &lt;d g, f&gt;8) r &lt;d g, f&gt; r | \grace { d16([ e)] } &lt;d g, f&gt;4(\sf &lt;c g e&gt;8) r &lt;c g e&gt; r } &lt;/score&gt;

The movement contains shades of the second movement of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, in the distortion of a traditional dance into a bitter and sarcastic one. Traditional chord sequences are altered into near-unrecognizable variations, turning the rustic yet gradually decaying C major introductory ländler into a vicious whole-tone waltz, saturated with chromaticism and frenetic rhythms. Strewn amidst these sarcastic dances is a slower and calmer ländler which reintroduces the &quot;sighing&quot; motif from the first movement.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \time 3/4 \partial 4*1 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; c8(-&gt; a&#x27;) \bar &quot;||&quot; &lt;a c,&gt;4-&gt;( &lt;g bes,&gt;2) | &lt;a c,&gt;4-&gt;( &lt;g bes,&gt;2) } \midi{\tempo 4 = 80} &lt;/score&gt;

The movement ends with a cheeky &quot;pianissimo&quot; nod from the piccolo and contrabassoon.

===III. &quot;Rondo-Burleske: Allegro assai. Sehr trotzig&quot;===
The third movement, in the form of a rondo, displays the final maturation of Mahler&#x27;s contrapuntal skills. It opens with a dissonant theme in the trumpet which is treated in the form of a double fugue .

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;trumpet&quot; \partial 4*1 b8\f cis | g2. } \midi{\tempo 4 = 150} &lt;/score&gt;

The following five-note motif introduced by strings in unison recalls the second movement of his Fifth Symphony.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative c { \clef bass \time 2/2 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; \partial 4*1 cis8\f dis | e dis cis4 } \midi{\tempo 4 = 150} &lt;/score&gt;

The addition of &quot;Burleske&quot; (a parody with imitations) to the title of the movement refers to the mixture of dissonance with Baroque counterpoint. Although the term &quot;Burlesque&quot; means &quot;humorous&quot;, the actual &quot;humor&quot; of the movement is relatively small compared to the overall field of manic violence, considering only two small neo-classical sections that appear more like a flashback than playfulness. The autograph score is marked &quot;to my brothers in Apollo&quot;.

===IV. &quot;Adagio. Sehr langsam und noch zurückhaltend&quot;===
The final movement, marked &quot;zurückhaltend&quot; (&quot;very slowly and held back&quot;; literally, &quot;reservedly&quot;), opens with only strings. Commentators have noted the similarity of the opening theme in particular to the hymn tune &quot;Eventide&quot; (familiarly sung as &quot;Abide with Me&quot;).

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key des \major \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; f\p f8. ees16 des4.( c8) | bes( ges&#x27;) f ees des4( aes) } \midi{\tempo 8 = 66} &lt;/score&gt;

But most importantly it incorporates a direct quote from the Rondo-Burleske&#x27;s middle section. Here it becomes an elegy. After several impassioned climaxes, the movement becomes increasingly fragmented and the coda ends quietly. On the closing pages, Mahler quotes the first violins from his own &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;: &quot;The day is fine on yonder heights&quot;.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef treble \key des \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; ges\ppp( f c&#x27; bes) | aes2~ aes8( ges d ees) | bes&#x27;( aes e f) c&#x27;2~ | c4( bes f ges) | ees&#x27;1 } \midi{\tempo 8 = 80} &lt;/score&gt;

The last note is marked &quot;ersterbend&quot; (&quot;dying away&quot;). The last two pages last for six minutes, an unprecedented amount of time for so few notes. Leonard Bernstein speculated at the end of his fifth Norton lecture that the entire movement is symbolically prophesying three kinds of death: Mahler&#x27;s own impending death, the death of tonality, and the death of &quot;Faustian&quot; culture in all the arts.

== Mahler&#x27;s death ==
Mahler died in May 1911, without ever hearing his Ninth Symphony performed. The work&#x27;s ending is usually interpreted as his conscious farewell to the world, as it was composed following the death of his beloved daughter Maria Anna in 1907 and the diagnosis of his fatal heart disease. However, this notion is disputed inasmuch as Mahler felt that he was in good health at the time of the composition of the Ninth Symphony; he had had a very successful season (1909–10) as the conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and, before that, the Metropolitan Opera (New York). In his last letters, Mahler indicated that he was looking forward to an extensive tour with the orchestra for the 1910–11 season and anticipating a return for the 1911–1912 season. Moreover, Mahler worked on his unfinished Tenth Symphony until his death from endocarditis in May 1911.

Mahler was a superstitious man and believed in the so-called curse of the ninth, which he thought had already killed Beethoven, Schubert and Bruckner; this is proven by the fact that he refused to number his previous work &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; as his ninth symphony, although it is often considered a symphony.

==Premieres==

The work was premiered on 26 June 1912, at the Vienna Festival by the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter. It was first published in the same year by Universal Edition.

* Dutch premiere: 2 May 1918, Amsterdam, with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Willem Mengelberg
* UK premiere: 27 February 1930, Manchester with The Hallé conducted by Hamilton Harty
* American premiere: 16 October 1931, Boston, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Serge Koussevitzky
* Japanese premiere: 16 April 1967, Tokyo, with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Kirill Kondrashin

==Interpretation==
The enjoyment of Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony prompted the essayist Lewis Thomas to write the title essay in his &quot;Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony&quot;.

Many Mahler interpreters have been moved to speak with similar profundity about the work:
* I have once more played through Mahler&#x27;s Ninth. The first movement is the most glorious he ever wrote. It expresses an extraordinary love of the earth, for Nature. The longing to live on it in peace, to enjoy it completely, to the very heart of one&#x27;s being, before death comes, as irresistibly it does.  – Alban Berg
* It is music coming from another world, it is coming from eternity. – Herbert von Karajan
* It &quot;is&quot; terrifying, and paralyzing, as the strands of sound disintegrate ... in ceasing, we lose it all. But in Mahler&#x27;s ceasing, we have gained everything. – Leonard Bernstein
* [Mahler&#x27;s] Ninth is most strange. In it, the author hardly speaks as an individual any longer. It almost seems as though this work must have a concealed author who used Mahler merely as his spokesman, as his mouthpiece. – Arnold Schoenberg
* Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony is not about death, but about dying. Death and dying are two entirely different matters. While working on the Ninth, I realized that I know of no other language apart from German in which the words &quot;death&quot; () and &quot;dying&quot; () have entirely different etymologies. ... the finale is just one sole extended act of dying, the disintegration of life. The last section, particularly the last page in the orchestra score, describes that situation so perfectly that it surpasses any other depiction, whether it be in literature or the fine arts. – Ádám Fischer

In the early half of the twentieth century, less favourable opinions of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies as finished works were common. This quote, from 1932, is typical:

*Someday, some real friends of Mahler&#x27;s will ... take a pruning knife and reduce his works to the length that they would have been if the composer had not stretched them out of shape; and then the great Mahler war will be over ... The Ninth Symphony would last about twenty minutes. – Deems Taylor

<text>Hans Erich Pfitzner (5 May 1869 – 22 May 1949) was a German composer, conductor and polemicist who was a self-described anti-modernist. His best known work is the post-Romantic opera &quot;Palestrina&quot; (1917), loosely based on the life of the sixteenth-century composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and his &quot;Missa Papae Marcelli&quot;.

== Life ==
Pfitzner was born in Moscow where his father played cello in a theater orchestra. The family returned to his father&#x27;s native town Frankfurt in 1872, when Pfitzner was two years old, he always considered Frankfurt his home town. He received early instruction in violin from his father, and his earliest compositions were composed at age 11. In 1884 he wrote his first songs. From 1886 to 1890 he studied composition with Iwan Knorr and piano with James Kwast at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. (He later married Kwast&#x27;s daughter Mimi Kwast, a granddaughter of Ferdinand Hiller, after she had rejected the advances of Percy Grainger.) He taught piano and theory at the Koblenz Conservatory from 1892 to 1893. In 1894 he was appointed conductor at the Staatstheater Mainz where he worked for a few months. These were all low-paying jobs, and Pfitzner was working as Erster (First) Kapellmeister with the Berlin Theater des Westens when he was appointed to a modestly prestigious post of opera director and head of the conservatory in Straßburg (Strasbourg) in 1908, when Pfitzner was almost 40.

In Strasbourg, Pfitzner finally had some professional stability, and it was there he gained significant power to direct his own operas. He viewed control over the stage direction to be his particular domain, and this view was to cause him particular difficulty for the rest of his career. The central event of Pfitzner&#x27;s life was the annexation of Imperial Alsace—and with it Strasbourg—by France in the aftermath of World War I. Pfitzner lost his livelihood and was left destitute at age 50. This hardened several difficult traits in Pfitzner&#x27;s personality: an elitism believing he was entitled to sinecures for his contributions to German art and for the hard work of his youth, notorious social awkwardness and a lack of tact, a sincere belief that his music was under-recognized and under-appreciated with a tendency for his sympathizers to form cults around him, a patronizing style with his publishers, and a feeling that he had been personally slighted by Germany&#x27;s enemies. His bitterness and cultural pessimism deepened in the 1920s with the death of his wife in 1926 and with meningitis affecting his older son Paul, who was committed to institutionalized medical care.

In 1895, Richard Bruno Heydrich sang the title role in the premiere of people like Hans Pfitzner&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot;, based on the poem of the same name by Hartmann von Aue. More to the point, Heydrich &quot;saved&quot; the opera. Pfitzner&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;Palestrina&quot;, which had its premiere in Munich on 12 June 1917 under the baton of Jewish conductor Bruno Walter. On the day before he died in February 1962, Walter dictated his last letter, which ended &quot;Despite all the dark experiences of today I am still confident that &quot;Palestrina&quot; will remain. The work has all the elements of immortality&quot;.
Easily the most celebrated of Pfitzner&#x27;s prose works is his pamphlet &quot;Futuristengefahr&quot; (&quot;Danger of Futurists&quot;), written in response to Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Sketch for a New Aesthetic of Music&quot;. &quot;Busoni,&quot; Pfitzner complained, &quot;places all his hopes for Western music in the future and understands the present and past as a faltering beginning, as the preparation. But what if it were otherwise? What if we find ourselves presently at a high point, or even that we have already passed beyond it?&quot; Pfitzner had a similar debate with the critic Paul Bekker.

Pfitzner dedicated his Violin Concerto in B minor, Op. 34 (1923) to the Australian violinist Alma Moodie. She premiered it in Nuremberg on 4 June 1924, with the composer conducting. Moodie became its leading exponent, and performed it over 50 times in Germany with conductors such as Pfitzner, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Hermann Scherchen, Karl Muck, Carl Schuricht, and Fritz Busch. At that time, the Pfitzner concerto was considered the most important addition to the violin concerto repertoire since the first concerto of Max Bruch (1866), although it is not played by most violinists these days. On one occasion in 1927, conductor Peter Raabe programmed the concerto for public broadcast and performance in Aachen but did not budget for copying of the sheet music; as a result, the work was &quot;withdrawn&quot; at the last minute and replaced with the familiar Brahms concerto.

==The Nazi era==
Increasingly nationalistic in his middle and old age, Pfitzner was at first regarded sympathetically by important figures in Nazi Germany, in particular by Hans Frank, with whom he remained on good terms. But he soon fell out with chief Nazis, who were alienated by his long musical association with the Jewish conductor Bruno Walter. He incurred extra wrath from the Nazis by refusing to obey the regime&#x27;s request to provide incidental music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; that could be used in place of the famous setting by Felix Mendelssohn, unacceptable to the Nazis because of his Jewish origin. Pfitzner maintained that Mendelssohn&#x27;s original was far better than anything he himself could offer as a substitute.

As early as 1923, Pfitzner and Hitler met. It was while the former was a hospital patient: Pfitzner had undergone a gall bladder operation when Anton Drexler, who knew both men well, arranged a visit. Hitler did most of the talking, but Pfitzner dared to contradict him regarding the homosexual and antisemitic thinker Otto Weininger, causing Hitler to leave in a huff. Later on, Hitler told Nazi cultural architect Alfred Rosenberg that he wanted &quot;nothing further to do with this Jewish rabbi.&quot; Pfitzner, unaware of this comment, believed Hitler to be sympathetic to him.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Rosenberg recruited Pfitzner, a notoriously bad speaker, to lecture for the Militant League for German Culture (&quot;Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur&quot;) that same year and Pfitzner accepted, hoping it would help him find an influential position. Hitler, however, saw to it that the composer was passed over in favor of party hacks for positions as opera director in Düsseldorf and &quot;Generalintendant&quot; of the Berlin Municipal Opera, despite hints from authorities that both positions were being held for him.

Very early in Hitler&#x27;s rule, Pfitzner received an injunction from Hans Frank (by this time Justice Minister in Bavaria) and Wilhelm Frick (Interior Minister in Hitler&#x27;s own cabinet) against traveling to the Salzburg Festival in 1933 to conduct his violin concerto. Pfitzner had managed to gain a stable conducting contract from the Munich opera in 1928, but ran into demeaning treatment from chief conductor Hans Knappertsbusch and from the opera house&#x27;s intendant, a man named Franckenstein.

In 1934 Pfitzner was forced into retirement and lost his positions as opera conductor, stage director and academy professor. He was also given a minimal pension of a few hundred marks a month, which he contested until 1937 when Goebbels resolved the issue. For a Nazi party rally in 1934, Pfitzner had hopes of being allowed to conduct; but he was rejected for the role, and at the rally himself he learned for the first time that Hitler considered him to be half-Jewish. Nor was Hitler the first person to suppose this. Winifred Wagner, the director of the Bayreuth Festival and a confidante of Hitler, also believed it. Pfitzner was forced to prove that he had, in fact, totally Gentile ancestry. By 1939 he had grown thoroughly disenchanted with the Nazi regime, except for Frank, whom he continued to respect.

Pfitzner&#x27;s views on &quot;the Jewish Question&quot; were both contradictory and illogical. He viewed Jewishness as a cultural trait rather than a racial one. A 1930 statement that caused difficulty for him in the pension affair was that although Jewry might pose &quot;dangers to German spiritual life and German Kultur,&quot; many Jews had done a lot for Germany and that antisemitism &quot;per se&quot; was to be condemned. He was willing to make exceptions to a general policy of antisemitism. For example, he recommended the performance of Marschner&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Templer und die Jüdin&quot; based on Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, protected his Jewish pupil Felix Wolfes of Cologne, along with conductor Furtwängler aided the young conductor Hans Schwieger, who had a Jewish wife, and maintained his friendship with Bruno Walter and especially his childhood journalist friend Paul Cossman, a &quot;self-loathing&quot; non-practicing Jew who was incarcerated in 1933.

The attempts which Pfitzner made on behalf of Cossman might have caused Gestapo chief Reinhard Heydrich, incidentally the son of the heldentenor who premiered Pfitzner&#x27;s first opera, to investigate him. Pfitzner&#x27;s petitions probably contributed to Cossman&#x27;s release in 1934, although he was eventually re-arrested in 1942 and died of dysentery in Theresienstadt. In 1938, Pfitzner joked that he was afraid to see a celebrated eye doctor in Munich because &quot;his great-grandmother had once observed a quarter-Jew crossing the street.&quot; He worked with Jewish musicians throughout his career. In the early thirties he often accompanied famed contralto Ottilie Metzger-Lattermann, later murdered in Auschwitz, in recitals and had dedicated his four songs, Op. 19, to her as early as 1905. He had dedicated his songs, Op. 24, to Jewish critic and Jewish cultural society founder Arthur Eloesser in 1909. Still, Pfitzner maintained close contact with virulent antisemites like music critics Walter Abendroth and Victor Junk, and did not scruple to use antisemitic invective (common enough among people of his generation, and not just in Germany) to pursue certain aims.
Pfitzner&#x27;s home having been destroyed in the war by Allied bombing, and his membership in the Munich Academy of Music having been revoked for his speaking out against Nazism, the composer in 1945 found himself homeless and mentally ill. But after the war he was denazified and re-pensioned, performance bans were lifted and he was granted residence in the old people&#x27;s home in Salzburg. There, in 1949, he died. Furtwängler conducted a performance of his Symphony in C major at the Salzburg Festival with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in the summer of 1949, just after the composer&#x27;s death. Following long neglect, Pfitzner&#x27;s music began to reappear in opera houses, concert halls and recording studios during the 1990s, including a controversial performance of the Covent Garden production of &quot;Palestrina&quot; in Manhattan&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 1997.

During the 1990s more and more musicologists, mainly German and British, began examining Pfitzner&#x27;s life and work. Biographer Hans Peter Vogel wrote that Pfitzner was the only composer of the Nazi era who attempted to come to grips with National Socialism both intellectually and spiritually after 1945. In 2001, Sabine Busch examined the ideological tug-of-war of the composer&#x27;s involvement with the National Socialists, based in part on previously unavailable material. She concluded that, although the composer was not exclusively pro-Nazi nor purely the antisemitic chauvinist often associated with his image, he engaged with Nazi powers who he thought would promote his music and became embittered when the Nazis found the &quot;elitist old master&#x27;s often morose music&quot; to be &quot;little propaganda-worthy.&quot; The most comprehensive English-language account of Pfitzner&#x27;s relations with the Nazis is by Michael Kater.

==Musical style and reception==

Pfitzner&#x27;s music—including pieces in all the major genres except the symphonic poem—was respected by contemporaries such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, although neither man cared much for Pfitzner&#x27;s innately acerbic manner (and Alma Mahler repaid his adoration with contempt, despite her agreement with his intuitive musical idealism, a fact evident in her letters to the wife of Alban Berg). Although Pfitzner&#x27;s music betrays Wagnerian influences, the composer was not attracted to Bayreuth, and was personally despised by Cosima Wagner, in part because Pfitzner sought notice and recognition from such &quot;anti-Wagnerian&quot; composers as Max Bruch and Johannes Brahms.

Pfitzner&#x27;s works combine Romantic and Late Romantic elements with extended thematic development, atmospheric music drama, and the intimacy of chamber music. Columbia University musicologist Walter Frisch has described Pfitzner as a &quot;regressive modernist.&quot; His is a highly personal offshoot of the Classical/Romantic tradition as well as the conservative musical aesthetic and Pfitzner defended his style in his own writings. Particularly notable are Pfitzner&#x27;s numerous and delicate lieder, influenced by Hugo Wolf, yet with their own rather melancholy charm. Several of them were recorded during the 1930s by the distinguished baritone Gerhard Hüsch, with the composer at the piano. His first symphony—the Symphony in C-sharp minor—underwent a strange genesis: it was not conceived in orchestral terms at all, but was a reworking of a string quartet. The works betray a late pious inspiration and although they take on a late Romantic qualities, they show others associated with the brooding unwieldiness of a modern idiom. For example, composer Arthur Honegger writes in 1955, after criticizing too much polyphony and overly long orchestral writing in a long essay devoted to &quot;Palestrina&quot;,

Musically, the work shows a superior design, which demands respect. The themes are clearly formed, which makes it easy to follow...

Pfitzner&#x27;s work was appreciated by contemporaries including Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, who explicitly described Pfitzner&#x27;s first string quartet (in D-Major) of 1902/03 as a masterpiece. Thomas Mann praised &quot;Palestrina&quot; in a short essay published in October 1917. He co-founded the Hans Pfitzner Association for German Music in 1918. Tensions with Mann, however, developed and the two severed relations by 1926.

From the mid-1920s, Pfitzner&#x27;s music increasingly fell in the shadow of Richard Strauss. His opera, &quot;Das Herz&quot; of 1932, was unsuccessful. Pfitzner remained a peripheral figure in the musical life of Nazi Germany, and his music was performed less frequently than in the late days of the Weimar Republic.

German critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt, writing in 1969, viewed Pfitzner&#x27;s music with extreme ambivalence: initiated with sharp dissonances and hard linear counterpoint determined to be taken as (and criticized for being) modernist. This became a conservative rebellion against all modernist conformity. Composer Wolfgang Rihm commented on the increasing popularity of Pfitzner&#x27;s work in 1981:

Pfitzner is too progressive, not simply, the way Korngold can be taken to be; he is also too conservative, if that means to be influenced by someone like Schoenberg. All this has audible consequences. We cannot find the brokenness of today in his work at first glance, but neither the unbroken yesterday. We find both, that is, none, and all attempts at classification falter.

<text>&quot;South Park&quot; is an American animated television sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for Comedy Central. Parker and Stone developed the series from two animated shorts both titled &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; (1992, 1995), and was originally developed for Fox. The series was later acquired by Comedy Central, which premiered &quot;South Park&quot; on August 13, 1997. Produced for an adult audience, &quot;South Park&quot; became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics. The series revolves around four boysStan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormickand their adventures in and around the eponymous Colorado town.

&quot;South Park&quot; has received multiple accolades, including three Annie Award nominations (with one win), two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nominations (with no wins), 17 Emmy Award nominations (with five wins), 3 TCA Awards nominations, and a Peabody Award. The first twenty-six seasons and all special episodes have been released on DVD and Blu-ray, in addition to several compilation releases.

On August 5, 2021, Comedy Central announced that Parker and Stone signed a $900 million deal for extending the series to 30 seasons through 2027. The deal also included a series of 14 films for Paramount+, which are released twice per year. Parker and Stone later denied that the projects were films, and clarified that it was ViacomCBS which decided to advertise them as such. Paramount+ advertises the projects as &quot;exclusive events&quot;, and they are generally accepted to be television specials. In September 2024, Parker and Stone confirmed that the next season would not air until 2025, stating that they want to skip on parodying Donald Trump and the 2024 United States presidential election.

<text>Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles (RENFE) was a Spanish state-owned company that operated the national Iberian-gauge railway network between 1941 and 2005. For more than six decades and as a monopoly, it was exclusively responsible for the transport of passengers and goods on its lines, as well as for the management of its infrastructure.

It was founded in Spain at the beginning of 1941, after the end of the Spanish Civil War, and existed for almost 64 years until its dissolution on December 31, 2004. In compliance with European rail transport regulations, RENFE was divided into two new entities: Adif, the largest managing entity of Spanish railway infrastructures, and Renfe-Operadora, the company that took over the operation of the publicly owned railroads. Subsequently, as of 2013, the same would happen with FEVE, the counterpart state-owned company in charge of the narrow-gauge railway network.

== History ==

=== Background ===

The foundation of RENFE took place in the context of the Spanish Civil War, with a large part of the Spanish railway network severely damaged during the war. However, the question of the nationalization of the railroads was already a long-standing one, as Francesc Cambó, during his ministerial period, had already advocated this idea due to the poor performance of the private railway companies, which maintained an outdated rolling stock and sometimes even a railway line in poor condition. With the outbreak of the civil war on July 18, 1936, the railway companies were seized by the state in the State Decree of August 3, 1936. Although in the &quot;uprising&quot; or &quot;nationalist&quot; zone the railroads continued their independent existence, the actual control was exercised by the military and not by the Boards of Directors. After the war, thousands of kilometers of railway lines were unusable, and 40% of the rolling stock was destroyed and the rest was in need of repair. Faced with this situation, the new Francoist state in 1939 managed the railway companies that were unable to carry out their work, prior to the creation of RENFE in 1941.

=== 1941-1959 ===
On January 24, 1941, the Government approved the &quot;Ley de Bases de Ordenación Ferroviaria y de los Transportes por Carretera&quot; by which all the Iberian-gauge companies operating in Spain were reunited in a single state company, the &quot;Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles&quot;, RENFE. Among the most important nationalized companies were the &quot;Compañía de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de&quot; &quot;España&quot; (1858-1941), the &quot;Compañía del Ferrocarril de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante&quot; (1856-1941) and the &quot;Compañía Nacional de los Ferrocarriles del Oeste&quot; (1928-1941). The &quot;Compañía de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces&quot;, due to its dismal economic results, had already passed under State control in 1936, through its integration into the &quot;Compañía de los Ferrocarriles del Oeste&quot;. The next step taken by the state was the difficult task of calculating the amount of compensation to be received by the former companies. At the head of the priority of the collection of the ransoms paid by the State (which would end up being quite high) were the bondholders, followed by the shareholders and, lastly, in the event that there was something left to be distributed, the participating companies. Thus, RENFE became for almost 64 years the dominant company in Spanish railroads.

At the time of its creation, RENFE had 12,401 km of track as well as a varied and already outdated rolling stock from the old companies. In the first years of its existence it had to respond to shortages of all kinds and the pressing need to reconstruct the damage caused by the recent Civil War, a difficult task due to the scarcity of economic resources. The lack of spare parts and wear and tear of the material was the cause of many serious accidents, such as the one that took place in Torre del Bierzo in January 1944, the most serious in the history of Spain. In 1949 the &quot;General Plan for Reconstruction and Urgent Reforms&quot; (known at the time as the &quot;Guadalhorce Plan&quot;) was approved with the aim of solving the most important needs. Among other things, it foresaw 5,000 million pesetas for the renovation of the network and the development of an extensive program. The Plan also included the renewal of material: the acquisition of 200 locomotives, 5000 wagons and 400 passenger cars was foreseen to complete the initial orders since 1941.

In the fifties, the results of the Guadalhorce Plan began to be seen and to recover, in part, the pre-war situation, but Spain was an impoverished country and the improvements and beginnings of modernization were very timid. In spite of everything, some steps were taken that would be the timid symbol of the intended reforms. In the same year, 1950, the first commercial Talgo services between Madrid and Hendaye began, although this was not the only innovation; in 1952 the TAF diesel railcars came into service, which meant a great qualitative leap in long-distance travel. Two years later, in 1954, the first Centralized Traffic Control Center was inaugurated, located between Ponferrada and Brañuelas. Coinciding with the end of the decade, two events of great importance took place: in 1958 the Zamora-Ourense railroad, whose construction had begun in 1927 and which had dragged on until now, came into service. First &quot;Suizas&quot; for commuter traffic. However, this period of progress and investments planned by RENFE within the Stabilization Plan came to an abrupt halt in 1959, in response to the inflation and serious economic crisis experienced in Spain at the end of that decade. The causes of this serious crisis are the clear failure of the autarkic policy that had prevailed in Franco&#x27;s regime since 1939 and that had tied up the Spanish economy.

=== 1960-1989 ===

The developmentalism of the sixties meant a progressive improvement in the Spanish economy, which was also reflected in the railroads. In this sense, there was a significant improvement in RENFE&#x27;s rolling stock, although this did not reach all the lines or the entire rolling stock. The improvements were always made on the main lines that concentrated the most passenger traffic, as is the case of the Madrid-Barcelona line, which is electrified and equipped with double track on most of the route.

In the case of the railway network, in 1962 the World Bank, in an extensive report on the Spanish economy, recommended abandoning investments in new lines and focusing the budgetary effort on improving the existing network. The only project that was saved from these cuts was the Railway from Madrid to Burgos through Aranda de Duero, which would be inaugurated a few years later. Following the lines advocated by the World Bank report, in 1964 the Government approved the Ten-Year Modernization Plan from 1964 to 1973, which would bring modernization of the rolling stock and improvement of the railway network, allowing the maximum speed of some trains to be raised to 140 km/h in 1967. The beginning of the 1970s brought a slowdown in the &quot;Ten-Year Modernization Plan from 1964 to 1973&quot;, which eventually led to the birth of the &quot;RENFE Plan 1972-1975&quot;, with a major modernization program.

On June 23, 1975 the last steam locomotive (a Mikado, specifically number 141F 2348) was taken out of service at the Vicálvaro (Madrid) Classification Station. The disappearance of the steam traction will not be the only event that happens that year, as on November 20 the dictator Francisco Franco dies and with it begins the beginning of the end for the Franco regime. This will have an impact on RENFE as it will mark the beginning of an era of extensive reforms aimed at turning the Spanish railroads into an efficient means of transport. The situation that RENFE had reached at the end of the seventies with huge annual deficits and a railway service that was not only inefficient but also unsustainable. In 1979, the first &quot;Contract Program&quot; was signed, elaborated as the &quot;General Railway Plan&quot;, which was to be in force for 12 years, but which would only be partially implemented. In addition, Cercanías services began to be implemented in Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga and Valencia, with the aim of absorbing the passenger traffic moving in these large urban centers. Cercanías will become one of the crown jewels for RENFE. However, any new reform plan clashed with reality.

In 1984 RENFE found itself in a critical situation with gigantic annual deficits, and the fact is that its trains run mainly on only 5000 km of the 13000 km of track it manages: there were too many lines that were not profitable. For this reason, the &quot;1984 Contract Program&quot; was agreed upon, whereby on January 1, 1985, 914 km of track were closed and 933 km were left for freight use only: 12 lines and 132 stations were left without service. In addition, the autonomous communities came to the rescue of more than 600 km to avoid their closure. The modernization of facilities such as the stations of Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, which are undergoing profound transformations to adapt to new needs, will be carried out. Many other stations and tracks are also being modernized. In particular, Atocha traffic was absorbed by Chamartín Station until the inauguration of the new Atocha Station in 1992.

=== 1991-2005 ===

Continuing with the projects already launched in the eighties, in 1991, work continued on the New Railway Access to Andalusia (NAFA), which involved the construction of Santa Justa Station to concentrate rail traffic in Seville. This in turn led to the dismantling of the San Bernardo and Plaza de Armas stations in Seville. A large part of these works carried out in the city of Seville had another reason: the celebration of the 1992 Universal Exposition (Expo 92). In Barcelona, there was a reorganization of the track system that circulated through different areas of the city, as well as the improvement and adaptation of some stations such as Barcelona-Término (renamed &quot;Estació de França&quot;) and Barcelona-Sants. As in Seville, these works were carried out within the framework of an urban reorganization, in this case, for the celebration of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. On April 14, 1992, the Madrid-Seville high-speed line was inaugurated, coinciding with the opening of Expo&#x27;92. It was a great moment for RENFE and the History of the Spanish railroads, which gave the world an image of modernity thanks to the publicity of Expo&#x27;92 and the Barcelona Olympics.

Another important measure was the creation of the Business Units in 1991, a consequence of the thorough reorganization of RENFE&#x27;s railway services and whose creation will eventually lead to the disappearance of the territorial model of the &quot;Zonas&quot;. This new model pursues economic profitability, reducing bureaucracy and the high costs involved in the organization of the Zones. From now on, RENFE will be organized around three main business units: &quot;Cercanías&quot;, &quot;Media Distancia&quot; and &quot;Larga Distancia&quot;.

On December 30, 1998, the company &quot;Gestor de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias&quot; (GIF) was founded, a public business entity that was created due to the railway transport measures that the European Union began to promote from the Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the &quot;Development of Community Railways&quot;, which established (among other issues) the separation between the train operators and the infrastructure manager. In 2003, the Madrid-Lleida section of the Madrid-Zaragoza-Barcelona-French Border high-speed line was inaugurated (at 200 km/h), the second to be inaugurated in Spain after the Madrid-Seville line and the first of the 21st century.

Due to the new economic directives of the European Union, the State had to open the railway network to competition, so a new legislation for the railway sector (LSF, or &quot;Law 39/2003 of the Railway Sector&quot;), which was supposed to come into force on June 1, 2004, but was delayed with the assumption of the Government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to January 1, 2005. On that day, the public business entity &quot;Renfe&quot; was separated from RENFE, and from that moment on, the latter began to be called &quot;Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias&quot; (Adif). The functions of the former company were divided between the two new entities:

* Renfe-Operadora, which is in charge of freight and passenger transport, in competition with other companies. It also carries out the maintenance and manufacture of railway material, participating in important national and international projects.
* Adif, which manages tracks, stations, communications, etc., charging a fee to the companies that use the network, including Renfe.

== Internal structure ==
As of 1990, the internal structure of the company changed with the creation of the Business Units, restructured as follows:

* Cercanías Business Unit
* Regional Business Unit
* Long Distance Business Unit - Major Lines
* High Speed Business Unit
* Freight Business Unit
* Combined Transport Business Unit
* Goods and Logistics Business Unit
* Integral Train Maintenance Business Unit
* Infrastructure Maintenance Business Unit

== Presidents ==
== Territorial organization ==

=== Origins ===

In its first five years of operation, the early RENFE maintained a bureaucratic division of its network based largely on the territorial boundaries of the former absorbed companies, so it used to speak of the &quot;North zone&quot;, the &quot;MZA zone&quot;, the &quot;Andalusian zone&quot;, and so on.

This system soon proved to be obsolete and on April 6, 1948, a new division by zones was implemented, creating a total of seven zones, which received the same name where their center was located: Madrid-North, Madrid-Atocha, Seville, Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao and Leon. In the case of Madrid it was divided in two, so that the railroads leaving Madrid to the north had their center in the North Station (nowadays Príncipe Pío Station) while those leaving to the south had their center in Atocha Station. The cars and wagons were marked on a label (generally located on the underside of the wagon) with the number of the zone to which they belonged. The Zone Directors came to have, especially in the decades of the forties and fifties, an almost military authority, often having small automobiles for their personal transportation to inspect the routes they were in charge of.

=== The &quot;Zones&quot; of the Network ===
This division of the 7 zones remained almost intact for many years, the limits of the zones being in 1973 marked by the following lines:

* First zone (Madrid-North): with its central services in Madrid, Príncipe Pío station. It extended along the lines originating in Madrid to the north, with limits from west to east, in Palazuelo-Empalme, Portugal border, Puebla de Sanabria, Astorga, Santander, Venta de Baños, Burgos and Coscurita. The Venta de Baños-Burgos section of the line from Madrid to Irún had belonged to the Sixth Zone in 1948.
* Second zone (Madrid-MZA): Based in Madrid, Atocha station, and limits on the border with Portugal to the West, Zafra, Almorchón, Santa Cruz de Mudela and Villarrobledo in the South, Utiel to the East, and Casetas and Soria in the Northwest limit.
* Third zone (Seville): Practically coincided with the Andalusian region, and its limits were Zafra, Almorchón, Santa Cruz de Mudela and Baza.
* Fourth zone (Valencia): It included the Levantine region and the province of Teruel. Its limits were, from south to north, the stations of Baza, Villarrobledo, Utiel, Calatayud, Zaragoza-Delicias and Tortosa.
* Fifth zone (Barcelona): It included Catalonia and Aragon and reached the French border, to the north; Zaragoza and Tortosa, to the west and south, respectively. The head of the zone was Barcelona-Término.
* Sixth zone (Bilbao): With southern limits in Casetas, Calatayud, Soria, Burgos and Venta de Baños. In Calatayud there was for a long time the only case of coexistence of three Renfe zones in a single town, as the line from Madrid to Barcelona (ex-MZA) belonged to the 2nd zone, the line from Calatayud to Cidade Dosante (ex-SM) to the 6th zone and the line from Calatayud to Valencia (ex-CA) to the 4th zone. In the original 1948 division, Zones 2, 5 and 6 coexisted in Casetas.
* Seventh zone (León): It comprised the provinces of Galicia, Asturias and León, with headquarters in the capital of the latter province and boundaries in Palencia, Astorga and Puebla de Sanabria.

As a result of the completion of the works from the Plan of Railway Links of 1933, a large number of new lines were incorporated to RENFE in the area of Madrid-capital between 1967 and 1972, giving rise to numerous points of contact between the First and Second Zone. Madrid had ceased to be a terminus station for many passenger trains, to become a passing station, which eventually ended up imposing the unification of the two zones into one, called &quot;Zona Centro&quot;. The opening of Chamartín Station in 1967, which led to the decline of &quot;Estación del Norte&quot;, also had an influence on this, and its responsibilities were transferred to Atocha Station. In order to avoid an unassigned number, number 2 was given to the Asturian-Galician-Leonese area previously represented by number 7.

On January 1, 1987, RENFE put into effect &quot;Circular number 5372&quot;, by which the size of the Central Zone was reduced, in order to balance its size with that of the peripheral zones. In the 1990s, the &quot;zones&quot; gradually disappeared and were replaced by &quot;operational management&quot;, reflecting the end of military terminology in favor of Anglo-Saxon-inspired corporate terminology. In 2005, the competences of the National Network at infrastructure level were transferred to Adif, and those of rolling stock and operation to Renfe.

<text>Eric Morecambe (John Eric Bartholomew; 14 May 1926 – 28 May 1984) and Ernie Wise (Ernest Wiseman; 27 November 1925 – 21 March 1999), known as Morecambe and Wise (and sometimes as Eric and Ernie), were an English comic double act, working in variety, radio, film and most successfully in television. Their partnership lasted from 1941 until Morecambe&#x27;s sudden death in 1984. They have been described as &quot;the most illustrious, and the best-loved, double-act that Britain has ever produced&quot;.

On a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; was placed 14th. In September 2006, they were voted by the general public as number 2 in a poll of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars. Their early career was the subject of the 2011 television biopic &quot;Eric and Ernie&quot;, and their 1970s career was the subject of the television biopic &quot;Eric, Ernie and Me&quot; in 2017.

In 1976, Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise were both awarded the OBE. In 1999, they were posthumously awarded the BAFTA Fellowship. In 2013, they were honoured with a blue plaque at Teddington Studios, where their last four series of &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; were recorded.

==History==
Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s friendship began in 1940 when they were each booked separately to appear in Jack Hylton&#x27;s revue &quot;Youth Takes a Bow&quot; at the Nottingham Empire Theatre. At the suggestion of Eric&#x27;s mother, Sadie, they worked on a double act. They made their double act debut, as Bartholomew and Wise, in August 1941 at the Liverpool Empire. War service broke up the act but they reunited by chance at the Swansea Empire Theatre in 1946 when they joined forces again. In 1950 Wise wrote to Bartholomew (Morecambe) saying that he wanted to break up the act as he thought it would not work. Morecambe responded that he had never heard such rubbish in his life, and advised Wise to get some rest before they got back to finding work.

They made their name in variety, appearing in a variety circus, the Windmill Theatre, the Glasgow Empire and many venues around Britain. After this they made their name in radio, first in &quot;Variety Fanfare&quot; (Ronnie Taylor, Hulme Hippodrome) made by the BBC in Manchester, and then with their own radio show, &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Once,&quot; first broadcast on 9 November 1953. 
With national fame they transferred to television in 1954. Their debut TV show, &quot;Running Wild&quot;, was not well received and led to a damning newspaper review: &quot;Definition of the week: TV set – the box in which they buried Morecambe and Wise.&quot; Eric apparently carried a copy of this review around with him ever afterward, and from then on the duo kept a tight control over their material. In 1956 they were offered a spot in the Winifred Atwell show with material written by Johnny Speight and this was a success. In 1959 they topped the bill in BBC TV&#x27;s long-running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; in a Boxing Day edition of the programme. In later years the pair became a Christmas TV institution in their own right.

They had a series of shows that spanned over twenty years, during which time they developed and honed their act, most notably after moving to the BBC in 1968, where they were to be teamed with their long-term writer Eddie Braben. It is this period of their careers that is widely regarded as their &quot;glory days&quot;. Their shows were:
* &quot;Running Wild&quot; (BBC, 1954) (Various writers)
* &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (ATV, 1961–68) (Writers: Hills and Green)
* &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot; (BBC, 1968–77) (Writers: Hills and Green (1968), Eddie Braben (1969–77))
* &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot; (Thames Television, 1978–83) (writers: Barry Cryer and John Junkin (1978), Eddie Braben (1980–83))
* &quot;The Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise Show&quot; (BBC Radio 2, 1975–78. Writer: Eddie Braben)

The pair starred in three feature films during the 1960s – &quot;The Intelligence Men&quot; (1965), &quot;That Riviera Touch&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Magnificent Two&quot; (1967). In 1983 they made their last film, &quot;Night Train to Murder&quot;. They were also guests on many television variety series; however, it was in a US series that they appeared as guests most frequently, featuring twelve times on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; between 1963 and 1968 – more than any other British entertainers. The duo were featured in a comic book in 1977.

As well as their TV work, the duo made two radio series. The first,&quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;, was broadcast in 1966, and included plays and musical numbers as well as the stand-up routine with which they always opened their show. Some of the plays would be adapted for TV. In the early 1970s the pair made a second radio series, but due to the BBC refusing the use of &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; name, the series was titled &quot;The Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise Radio Show&quot;.

==Style and performance==
Morecambe and Wise started as a song-and-dance comedic team, with Morecambe playing the more bumbling comic role and Wise the affable straight man, but over time (and with new writers) the nature of the act changed. By the 1960s, the characters were more complex, with both Morecambe and Wise playing comedic characters who could set up each other for laughs, as well as garner big laughs with their many catchphrases, character bits and reactions. In essence, the straight man/wacky comic dynamic shifted, so that both men were equally capable of fulfilling either role. In the later and most successful part of their career, which spanned the 1970s, Morecambe and Wise were joined behind the scenes by Eddie Braben, a script writer who generated almost all their material (Morecambe and Wise were also sometimes credited as supplying &quot;additional material&quot;) and defined what is now thought of as typical Morecambe and Wise humour. Together Morecambe, Wise and Braben were known as &quot;The Golden Triangle&quot;, becoming one of the UK&#x27;s all-time favourite comedy acts.

John Ammonds was also central to the duo&#x27;s most successful period in the 1970s. As the producer of the BBC TV shows, it was his idea to involve celebrity guests. He also perfected the duo&#x27;s familiar dance, which was based on a dance performed by Groucho Marx in the film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;.

Ernest Maxin started choreographing the musical numbers in 1970, and succeeded John Ammonds as producer of the BBC TV shows in 1974. Maxin, who won a BAFTA for the Best Light Entertainment Show for the Morecambe and Wise 1977 Christmas Show, was also responsible for devising and choreographing many of their great musical comedy routines including &quot;The Breakfast Sketch&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and the homage to South Pacific, &quot;There is Nothing Like a Dame&quot; featuring BBC newsreaders in an acrobatic dance routine.

===Catchphrases and visual gags===
Much of the material of the Morecambe and Wise shows consisted of their well-worn catch phrases that recurred like motifs throughout their career. Barely a show would go by without Eric referring to Ernie&#x27;s &quot;short, fat, hairy legs&quot;, or pointing out that &quot;you can&#x27;t see the join&quot;, where Ernie&#x27;s supposed wig was attached. The wig sometimes appeared in the credits, with variations on &quot;Mr Wise appears by kind permission of Rentawig&quot;. Eric never seemed to tire of offering his partner some &quot;Tea, Ern?&quot;, a pun on &quot;tea urn&quot;, a vessel for serving hot drinks used in workplaces. If anyone fluffed their line, Eric would usually say, &quot;That&#x27;s easy for you to say!&quot; or &quot;You can say that again&quot;. When Ernie disagreed with him, Eric would say, &quot;Just watch it, that&#x27;s all!&quot;; often said by Eric when grabbing Ernie by the lapels. If someone said a line whilst he was looking at somebody else, Eric would say, &quot;You said that without moving your lips&quot;; as if the non-speaker were a ventriloquist throwing his or her voice. Another ventriloquial allusion (probably quoting Arthur Worsley) was made when Eric said, should his intended listener be looking away, &quot;Look at me when I&#x27;m talking to you!&quot;

Some catch phrases developed from earlier sketches. When Eric played an incompetent &#x27;Mr Memory&#x27;, unable to remember anything without unsubtle prompting from Ernie, Ernie prompted Eric with &quot;Arsenal!&quot; disguised very badly as a cough. Later, whenever Ernie, or anyone else, coughed or sneezed, Eric would shout &quot;Arsenal!&quot;

The catchphrase &quot;Hello folks, and what about the workers?&quot; was developed by Eric from a similar saying by Harry Secombe in The Goon Show. For Secombe this was a simple greeting, while for Eric it expressed his great sexual interest in some pretty girl or female guest. It was often accompanied by him slapping the back of his own neck to recover his concentration.

Their treatment of their guest stars was terrible for effect. Eric and sometimes Ernie would often call an invited guest by the wrong name. So André Previn was &quot;Andrew Preview&quot;, Ian Carmichael was Hoagy Carmichael, Elton John was Elephant John, Vanessa Redgrave was &quot;Vanilla Redgrave&quot; and when The Beatles appeared, Ringo Starr was &quot;Bongo&quot;. Alternatively, one or both would seem not to recognise the famous guest artist at all. The pair would frequently make fun of their old friend, the singer and entertainer Des O&#x27;Connor in various disparaging ways. A rhyming example was: &quot;If you want me to be a goner, get me an LP by Des O&#x27;Connor&quot;. Another typical example was &quot;There&#x27;s only one thing wrong with Des O&#x27;Connor records. The hole in the middle isn&#x27;t big enough&quot;. O&#x27;Connor actually appeared in the 1975 Christmas special and eavesdropped on these insults before Eric and Ernie noticed him. In reality some of these put-downs were suggested by Des himself.

Many of their catch phrases entered the language. Particularly when they were at their peak, people could be heard using them for humorous effect. The question: &quot;What do you think of it so far?&quot;, said by Eric, who would use a prop—such as a statue or stuffed toy—to answer: &quot;Rubbish!&quot;, was frequently heard. Morecambe said later that whenever Luton Town were playing away and he happened to be in the director&#x27;s box, if Luton were behind at half-time the home fans would shout, &quot;What do you think of it so far?&quot; Other examples were: &quot;There&#x27;s no answer to that!&quot;, which was said by Eric after anything which could be construed as innuendo. He would also say &quot;Pardon?&quot; for a similar effect.

Schoolboys could be seen holding an open hand underneath a friend&#x27;s chin while saying, &quot;Get out of that without moving!&quot; When Eric did this to Ernie, it was meant to be a karate move that incapacitated the victim. It was often followed by &quot;You can&#x27;t, can you?&quot; Also common was, &quot;They can&#x27;t touch you for it&quot; (i.e., it is not illegal); a comment following a slightly obscure word, turning it into a double entendre. In addition, Eric would say &quot;Be honest&quot; directly to the audience if they had carried out what he thought was a particularly successful routine. If Ernie received a little applause for something, Eric would say &quot;I see your fan&#x27;s in&quot;, and whenever the doorbell rang in their shared flat, Eric would say to Ernie, &quot;How do you do that?&quot;

Another long-running - usually incomplete - gag was when Eric begins a story, ‘There were two old men sitting in deckchairs. One turns to the other and says, “It’s nice out today. Ernie usually closed down the gag at that point as it was obviously heading for a rude punchline. Occasionally, however, he would close it with &quot;Well, put it away, there&#x27;s a Policeman coming!&quot; In a Christmas special when the duo were being interviewed by Sir David Frost, Eric concluded the story with &quot;You&#x27;re right, I think I&#x27;ll get mine out.&quot;

During the shows in which Ernie&#x27;s execrable plays were shown, a catch phrase for Ernie was developed. This was, &quot;The play what I wrote&quot;, which also was used commonly elsewhere. Guest stars were conned into taking part in these plays and made to utter such grammatical monstrosities as when Glenda Jackson (at the time a noted Shakespearean actress) had to say, &quot;All men are fools and what makes them so is having beauty, like what I have got&quot;, to the obvious smug satisfaction of the words&#x27; supposed author.

Several visual gags were often repeated.

Very frequently used, and copied by the public, was Eric slapping the shoulders and then both sides of Ernie&#x27;s face. A particular affectation of Eric was him putting his glasses askew or waggling them up and down on his nose. As with André Previn, if they appeared uncooperative, Eric would grab a guest by the lapels and pull them to his face in a threatening manner. He would also grimace like Humphrey Bogart (or so he thought) if Ernie or a guest was particularly challenging.

Eric would often hold an empty paper bag in one hand, throw an imaginary coin, or other small object, into the air, watch it during its flight and then flick the bag with his finger giving the impression that the item had landed in the bag. Again, he would hold a paper cup in his mouth and over his nose to perform a brief impersonation of Jimmy Durante, singing, &#x27;Sitting at my pianna the udder day...&#x27;

Ernie would appear on a curtained stage expecting Eric to join him from behind the curtain, but Eric would be unable to find the opening and have to fight his way on. This gag could be reversed with Eric trying to fight his way off, often asking Ernie if he had a key to unlock the curtain. Another curtain gag would have Eric standing in front of the stage curtains or at the side of the stage and pretending that an arm (his own) comes out from behind the curtain and seizes him by the throat. If Eric had his back to a guest, he would jerk his body as if the guest had goosed him. This was seemingly adlibbed by Eric during a scene in the play &quot;Robin Hood&quot;: it would appear that Ann Hamilton (as Maid Marion) was unable to exit the stage as she was supposed to owing to Eric standing on her flowing dress.

Often, Eric would suddenly notice the camera and put on a fixed, cheesy grin. Ernie would frequently notice him doing this, stand behind Eric and grin a similar grin into the camera, over Eric&#x27;s shoulder. Eric and Ernie would introduce the special guest facing stage-left with their arms out. However, the guest would enter from stage-right. Also, at the end of several shows, the duo would exit the stage by skipping while putting alternate hands behind their heads and backs.

==Television series==
Typical Morecambe and Wise programmes were effectively sketch shows crossed with a sitcom. The duo would usually open the show as themselves on a mock stage in front of curtains emblazoned with an M and W logo. Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s comic style varied subtly throughout their career, depending on their writers. Their writers during most of the 1960s, Dick Hills and Sid Green, took a relatively straightforward approach, depicting Eric as an aggressive, knockabout comedian and Ernie as an essentially conventional and somewhat disapproving straight man. When Eddie Braben took over as writer, he made the relationship considerably deeper and more complex. The critic Kenneth Tynan noted that, with Braben as writer, Morecambe and Wise had a unique dynamic—Ernie was a comedian who wasn&#x27;t funny, while Eric was a straight man who was funny. The Ernie persona became simultaneously more egotistical and more naïve. Morecambe pointed out that Braben wrote him as &quot;tougher, less gormless, harder towards Ern.&quot; Wise&#x27;s contribution to the humour is a subject of an ongoing debate. To the end of his life he would always reject interviewers&#x27; suggestions that he was the straight man, preferring to call himself the song-and-dance man. However, Wise&#x27;s skill and dedication was essential to their joint success, and Tynan praised Wise&#x27;s performance as &quot;unselfish, ebullient and indispensable&quot;.

A central concept was that the duo lived together as close, long-term friends (there were many references to a childhood friendship) who shared not merely a flat but also a bed—although their relationship was purely platonic and merely continued a tradition of comic partners sleeping in the same bed that had begun with Laurel and Hardy. Morecambe was initially uncomfortable with the bed-sharing sketches, but changed his mind upon being reminded of the Laurel and Hardy precedent; however, he still insisted on smoking his pipe in the bed scenes &quot;for the masculinity&quot;. The front room of the flat and also the bedroom were used frequently throughout the show episodes, although Braben would also transplant the duo into various external situations, such as a health food shop or a bank. Many references were made to Ernie&#x27;s supposed meanness with money and drink (for example Eric telling Shirley Bassey of Ernie&#x27;s dislike of her hit &quot;Big Spender&quot;). 

Another concept of the shows during the Braben era was Ernie&#x27;s utterly confident presentation of amateurishly inept plays &quot;wot I wrote&quot;. This allowed for another kind of sketch: the staged historical drama, which usually parodied genuine historical television plays or films (such as &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, or Napoleon and Josephine). Wise&#x27;s character would write a play, complete with cheap props, shaky scenery and appallingly clumsy writing (&quot;the play what I wrote&quot; became a catchphrase), which would then be acted out by Morecambe, Wise and the show&#x27;s guest star. Guests who participated included many big names of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Dame Flora Robson, Penelope Keith, Laurence Olivier, Sir John Mills, Vanessa Redgrave, Eric Porter, Peter Cushing (who, in a running gag, would keep turning up to complain that he had not been paid for an earlier appearance) and Frank Finlay, as well as Glenda Jackson (as Cleopatra: &quot;All men are fools. And what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got...&quot;). Jackson had not previously been known as a comedian, and this appearance led to her Oscar-winning role in &quot;A Touch of Class&quot;. Morecambe and Wise would often pretend not to have heard of their guest, or would appear to confuse them with someone else (former UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned the favour, when appearing as a guest at the duo&#x27;s flat, by referring to Morecambe as &quot;Mor-e-cam-by&quot;). Also noteworthy was the occasion when the respected BBC newsreader Angela Rippon was induced to show her legs in a dance number (she had trained as a ballet dancer before she became a journalist and TV presenter). Braben later said that a large amount of the duo&#x27;s humour was based on irreverence. A running gag in a number of shows was a short sequence showing a well-known artist in close-up saying &quot;I appeared in an Ernie Wise play, and look what happened to me!&quot;. The camera would then pull back and show the artist doing some low-status job such as newspaper seller (Ian Carmichael), Underground guard (Fenella Fielding), dustman (Eric Porter), bus conductor (André Previn), or some other ill-paid employment. However, celebrities felt they had received the highest accolade in showbusiness by being invited to appear in &quot;an Ernest Wide play&quot; as Ernie once mispronounced it during a show&#x27;s introduction involving &quot;Vanilla&quot; (Vanessa) Redgrave.

As a carry-over from their music hall days, Eric and Ernie sang and danced at the end of each show, although they were forced to abandon this practice when Morecambe&#x27;s heart condition prevented him from dancing. The solution was that Eric would walk across the stage with coat and bag, ostensibly to wait for his bus, while Ernie danced by himself. Their peculiar skipping dance, devised by their BBC producer John Ammonds, was a modified form of a dance used by Groucho Marx. Their signature tune was &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot;. They either sang this at the end of each show or it was used as a theme tune during the credits (although in their BBC shows they used other songs as well, notably &quot;Following You Around&quot;, &quot;Positive Thinking&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t You Agree&quot; and &quot;Just Around the Corner&quot;). A standard gag at the end of each show was for Janet Webb to appear behind the pair, walk to the front of the stage and push them out of her way. She would then recite:

Webb was never announced, and seldom appeared in their shows in any other role. According to a BBC documentary, this was a parody of George Formby&#x27;s wife, who used to come on stage to take the bows with him at the end of a show.

Another running gag involved an old colleague from their music hall days, harmonica player Arthur Tolcher. Arthur would keep appearing on the stage in evening wear and would play the opening bars of &quot;España cañí&quot; on his harmonica, only to be told &quot;Not now, Arthur!&quot; At the very end of the show, following the final credit, Arthur would sneak on stage and begin to play, only for the screen to cut to black.

In June 2007, the BBC released a DVD of surviving material from their first series in 1968, and the complete second series from 1969. In November 2011, Network DVD released the complete, uncut 13 episodes of the second ATV series of &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; from 1962. It was advertised as the first series due to the fact the original first series is completely missing from television archives.

In 2020, a black and white copy of an episode from October 1970, believed lost, was found in the attic of Morecambe&#x27;s widow. It was restored for re-broadcast at Christmas 2021.

===Christmas specials===
With the exception of 1974, the show had end-of-year Christmas specials, which became some of the highest-rated TV programmes of the era. Braben has said that people judged the quality of their Christmas experience on the quality of the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special&quot;. From 1969 until 1980, except 1974, the shows were always broadcast on Christmas Day. Due to Eric Morecambe&#x27;s heart attack, Christmas Day 1974 featured a highlights package of clips from previous shows rather than a new programme, introduced by Michael Parkinson, including a newly recorded interview with Morecambe &amp; Wise.

The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show on BBC in 1977 scored one of the highest ever audiences in British television history with more than 20 million viewers (the cited figure varies between 21 and 28 million, depending on the source). The duo remain among the most consistently high-rating performers of all time on British television, regularly topping the in-week charts during their heyday in the 1970s and early 1980s.

===Famous sketches===
;Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto
Classic sketches from such shows often revolve around the guest stars. One example is the 1971 appearance of André Previn, who is introduced onstage by Ernie as Andrew Preview. Previn&#x27;s schedule was extremely tight, and Morecambe and Wise were worried that he had very little time to rehearse: popular myth holds that Previn had to learn his lines in the taxi on the way from the airport, but in reality he had taken part in two days of rehearsals (out of a planned five) before having to fly to America to see his mother, who had been taken ill. The final result was described by their biographer as &quot;probably their finest moment&quot;.

The sketch was a rework of one which appeared in &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (Series 3, Episode 7) and written by Green and Hills.

Previn is initially enthusiastic as a guest, but he is perplexed by the news that he will not, after all, be conducting Yehudi Menuhin in Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto, but Edvard Grieg&#x27;s A minor Piano Concerto with Eric as piano soloist: 

At this point in the sketch Morecambe punches the air with his fist and ad-libs the line &quot;Pow! He&#x27;s in! I &quot;like&quot; him! I &quot;like&quot; him!&quot;. The television executive Michael Grade has observed that it was Previn&#x27;s expert delivery of his lines that caused Morecambe to visibly relax: &quot;Eric&#x27;s face lights up as if to say, &#x27;Oh, &quot;yes&quot;! This is going to be &quot;great&quot;!&quot; Since Previn had little time to rehearse, his comic timing was a surprise to Morecambe, who had explained to Previn simply that &quot;None of the three of us should believe that this is funny.&quot;

Eric goes on to treat Previn and the orchestra with his customary disdain (&quot;In the Second Movement, not too heavy on the banjos&quot;) and produces his own score (&quot;autographed copies available afterwards, boys&quot;) but consistently fails to enter on the conductor&#x27;s cue. This is because, when the orchestra begins, Eric is standing right next to Previn. During the introductory bars, Eric has to descend from the conductor&#x27;s rostrum, down to his place at the piano. This he cannot do in the time available—or rather, deliberately meanders so as to miss his cue. After failing twice to reach the piano, they decide he should be seated there at the start. Even then, he cannot see Previn when the conductor gestures for him to begin playing, because the piano lid obscures his view. Previn has to leap in the air at the appropriate time, so that Eric can see him. When he finally manages to enter on time, Eric&#x27;s rendition of the piano part is so bizarre that Previn becomes exasperated and tells Eric that he is playing &quot;all the wrong notes&quot;. Eric stands up, seizes Previn by the lapels and menacingly informs him &quot;I&#x27;m playing all the right notes—but not necessarily in the right order.&quot; Previn demonstrates how the piece should be played but Eric, after a moment&#x27;s reflection, delivers a verdict of &quot;Rubbish!&quot; and he and Ernie walk off in disgust. Previn starts playing Eric&#x27;s version and the duo rush back, declare that Previn has finally &quot;got it&quot; and start dancing ecstatically. The sketch&#x27;s impact can be assessed by the fact that twenty-five years later, London taxi drivers were still addressing André Previn as &quot;Mr. Preview&quot;.

;Singin&#x27; in the Rain
One of the famous Morecambe and Wise routines is their 1976 Christmas Show parody of the scene from the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; in which Gene Kelly dances in the rain and sings the song &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. This recreation features Ernie exactly copying Gene Kelly&#x27;s dance routine, on a set which exactly copies the set used in the movie. Eric performs the role of the policeman. The difference from the original is that in the Morecambe and Wise version, there is no water, except for some downpours onto Eric&#x27;s head (through a drain, or dumped out of a window, &quot;etc.&quot;). This lack of water was initially because of practical considerations (the floor of the studio had many electrical cables on it, and such quantities of water would be dangerous)—but Morecambe and Wise found a way to turn the lack of water into a comic asset. The sketch was devised and choreographed by Ernest Maxin.

;The Breakfast Sketch
This 1976 sketch has become one of the duo&#x27;s most familiar, and is a parody of a stripper routine where Eric and Ernie are seen listening to the radio at breakfast time. This sketch was not an original but was adapted from an earlier one Benny Hill performed on his own show during the mid-1960s. David Rose&#x27;s tune &quot;The Stripper&quot; comes on and the duo perform a dance using various kitchen utensils and food items, including Ernie catching slices of toast as they pop out of the toaster, and finally opening the fridge door to be bathed in light, as if on stage, while they pull out strings of sausages which they whirl around to the music. The sketch was choreographed and produced by Ernest Maxin.

In December 2007, viewers of satellite channel Gold voted the sketch the best moment of Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s shows.

Propellerheads parodied the sketch in the video for their 1998 single &quot;Crash!&quot; and it was parodied in two UK television commercials in 2008, for PG Tips and Aunt Bessie&#x27;s Yorkshire Puddings.

==Bring Me Sunshine==
Bring Me Sunshine was a gala concert held at the London Palladium on 28 November 1984 in the presence of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in aid of the British Heart Foundation and was held in memory of Morecambe who had died the previous May after many years of heart problems. It was hosted by Wise and featured a host of personalities all paying their tribute to Morecambe. The show began with a dance routine, the theme for the whole evening&#x27;s music being &quot;sunshine&quot; the dancers were accompanied by &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;, which was followed by the big entrance of Wise who first spoke, and then sang the duo&#x27;s signature tune. This was an emotive moment for Wise, and one that showed how big a part Morecambe had played in his life. Other stars that appeared over the course of the evening were:

* Benny Hill (who performed his headmaster routine, complete with lectern)
* Dickie Henderson (with his well-known &quot;off-key singer&quot; routine)
* Cannon &amp; Ball (who had been cited as the next big double act)
* Kenny Ball &amp; His Jazzmen (who had appeared on many of their shows)
* Angela Rippon (who recreated her tiller girl dance routine)
* James Casey, Eli Woods &amp; Roy Castle (elephant in the box routine)
* Bruce Forsyth (who played piano and did a stand-up routine)
* Des O&#x27;Connor (the long-term butt of Morecambe&#x27;s jibes)
* Jim Davidson

There was also a sequence in which the guests of honour were announced and appeared on stage, these included the following guest stars, fans and celebrities:

* John Thaw
* Sheila Hancock
* Martin Shaw
* Glenda Jackson
* Fulton Mackay
* Dickie Davies
* Francis Matthews

The programme was filmed live and televised on ITV on Christmas Day of that year; in his summing up Des O&#x27;Connor gave a touching and heartfelt tribute to Morecambe proclaiming that &quot;...on the way here tonight I went through Trafalgar Square and the Christmas decorations were going up. I looked at the giant tree and thought to myself &#x27;there&#x27;s going to be one less star on the tree this year.&#x27; &quot; It was a glittering night that featured the cream of British talent paying tribute to a man who had been considered the best of the best among his peers.

The programme, made and broadcast by Thames Television was aired once and has never been repeated or made commercially available in any format. However, the segment of Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s piano playing and dancing was used in a compilation programme, &quot;Heroes Of Comedy&quot;, made in 1994 for Channel 4.

==Tribute album==
Eric and Ernie often cited the earlier comedy team Flanagan and Allen as influences on their own work; although Morecambe and Wise never imitated or copied Flanagan and Allen, they did sometimes work explicit references to the earlier team into their own cross-talk routines and sketches. In 1971 they recorded a tribute album, &quot;Morecambe and Wise Sing Flanagan and Allen&quot; (Philips 6382 095), in which they performed some of the earlier team&#x27;s more popular songs in their own style, without attempting to imitate the originals.

==Films==
* &quot;The Intelligence Men&quot; (1965)
* &quot;That Riviera Touch&quot; (1966)
* &quot;The Magnificent Two&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Night Train to Murder&quot; (TV film, 1985)

==Personal lives==
Eric Morecambe married Joan Bartlett in 1952; six weeks later, Ernie Wise married dancer Doreen Blythe, whom he had met in 1947. The Morecambes raised three children, but Wise resolved never to have a family; in Doreen&#x27;s words, &quot;Ernie always said that as soon as children are involved the wife stays home, and that&#x27;s where trouble lies.&quot;

Morecambe had periods of poor health, and smoked and drank heavily. He suffered a heart attack in 1968, followed by another after bypass surgery in 1979; these compelled him to stop smoking and drinking, and he became a celebrity spokesman for heart research. His fatal heart attack, in 1984, struck during a curtain call of a performance in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

After Morecambe&#x27;s death, Wise fell back on his song-and-dance skills and pursued a solo career, with limited success. He ultimately gave up performing and found new success as an elder statesman of British comedy, giving interviews, telling anecdotes, and appearing at awards ceremonies. Wise maintained a holiday home in Florida, where he suffered two heart attacks in November 1998. After triple bypass surgery, Wise returned to England and convalesced for five months at Nuffield Hospital in Berkshire, where he died peacefully.

<text>GNOME Web, called Epiphany until 2012 and still known by that code name, is a free and open-source web browser based on the GTK port of Apple&#x27;s WebKit rendering engine, called WebKitGTK. It is developed by the GNOME project for Unix-like systems. It is the default and official web browser of GNOME, and part of the GNOME Core Applications.

Despite being a component of GNOME, Web has no dependency on GNOME components.

GNOME Web is the default web browser on elementary OS, Bodhi Linux version 5 and PureOS GNOME Edition.

== History ==
=== Naming ===
GNOME Web was originally named &quot;Epiphany&quot;, but was rebranded in 2012 as part of GNOME 3.4. The name Epiphany is still used internally, as its code name, for development and in the source code. The package remains &quot;epiphany-browser&quot; in Debian (to avoid a name collision with a video game that is also called &quot;Epiphany&quot;) and &quot;epiphany&quot; in Fedora and Arch Linux.

=== Development ===
==== Galeon ====

Marco Pesenti Gritti, the initiator of Galeon, originally developed Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. The fork occurred because of the disagreement between Gritti and the rest of Galeon developers about new features. Gritti regarded Galeon&#x27;s monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors that were limiting Galeon&#x27;s maintainability and usability, but the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to add more features.

Around the same time, the GNOME project adopted a set of human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers disapproved. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon, with most of the non-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply with the GNOME HIG. As such, Epiphany used the global GNOME theme and other settings from inception.

Gritti explained his motivations:

Galeon continued after the fork, but lost momentum due to the remaining developers&#x27; failure to keep up with changes in the Mozilla platform. Galeon development stalled and the developers decided to work on extensions to bring Galeon&#x27;s advanced features to Epiphany.

Gritti ended his work on Epiphany and a GNOME team led by Xan Lopez, Christian Persch and Jean-François Rameau now direct the project. Gritti died of cancer on May 23, 2015.

==== Gecko-based ====
The first version of Epiphany was released on December 24, 2002.

Epiphany initially used the Gecko layout engine from the Mozilla project to display web pages. It provided a GNOME graphical user interface for Gecko, instead of Mozilla&#x27;s cross-platform interface.

The development of Epiphany was mainly focused on usability improvements compared to major browsers at the time. The most notable was the new text entry widget, which was introduced in version 1.8. The new widget supported icons inside the text area and reduced the screen space needed to present information, while improving GNOME integration.

The next major milestone was version 2.14, which was the first to follow GNOME&#x27;s version numbering. It also featured network awareness using NetworkManager, smart bookmarks improvements, and the option to build with XULRunner.

The latter was critical. Previously, Epiphany could only use an installed Mozilla web browser as a web engine provider. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the only web browser on the system.

==== WebKit-based ====
The development process suffered from major problems related to the Gecko backend. Notably, the release cycles of the two projects did not line up efficiently. Additionally, Mozilla increasingly disregarded third-party software that wished to make use of Gecko, until it became viewed as an integrated Firefox component. To address these issues, in July 2007, the Epiphany team added support for WebKit as an alternative rendering engine. On , the team announced that it would remove the ability to build it using Gecko and proceed using only WebKit.

The size of the team and complexity of porting the browser to WebKit caused version 2.22 to be re-released with bugfixes alongside GNOME 2.24, so the releases stagnated until , when it was announced that 2.26 would be the final Gecko-based version.

In September 2009, the transition to WebKit was completed as part of GNOME 2.28.

=== Version history ===
Developers of GNOME Web maintain a complete and accurate changelog in its official repository that shows complete and detailed changes between all the releases, following table just shows arbitrarily mentioned some notable and important changes:

== Features ==

As a component of GNOME Core Applications, it provides full integration with GNOME settings and other components like GNOME Keyring to securely store passwords, following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and the GNOME software stack to provide first-class support for the all new-adopted edge technologies such as Wayland and the latest major GTK versions, multimedia support using GStreamer, small package size (2.6MB) and very fast execution/startup time due to using shared components; other features include the &quot;reader mode&quot;, mouse gestures, smart bookmarks, praised web application integration mechanism, built-in ad blocking, the &quot;Insert Emoji&quot; option in the context menu for quick and easy inserting of Emoji and &quot;Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs&quot; into the text boxes, Google Safe Browsing, supports reading and saving MHTML, an archive format for web pages that combines all the files of web pages into only one single file; and consume fewer system resources than the major cross-platform web browsers.

=== Web standards support ===
The underlying WebKit browser engine provides support for HTML 4, XHTML, CSS 1 and 2, most of HTML 5 and CSS 3, and a Web Inspector (web development debugging tool).

Encrypted Media Extensions support is not a goal, as the standard does not specify a Content Decryption Module to use, all available modules are proprietary even if licensing is possible, and the system imposes digital rights management that hides what the user&#x27;s computer is doing to make copying &quot;premium content&quot; difficult. However, Media Source Extensions is supported, as YouTube began to require this technology in November 2018.

Apple, which is the primary corporate backer of WebKit, rejected at least 16 web APIs because they could be used in a fingerprinting attack to help personally identify users and track them, while providing limited or no benefit to the user. As HTML5test checks for most of these APIs, it artificially lowers WebKit&#x27;s &quot;score&quot; in points (as does lack of DRM support).

Web once supported NPAPI plug-ins, such as Java and Adobe Flash, but support was removed in GNOME 3.34. In the modern web platform, these have fallen out of favor and support has been removed from all major browsers. Flash has been deprecated by Adobe itself. Flash had gained infamy throughout the years for usability and stability issues, incessant security vulnerabilities, its proprietary nature, its ability to let sites deploy particularly obnoxious web ads, and Adobe&#x27;s poor and inconsistent Linux support. Many of these issues were raised by Steve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, in his essay Thoughts on Flash.

=== GNOME integration ===
Web reuses GNOME frameworks and settings, including the user interface theme, network settings, and printing. Settings are stored with GSettings and GNOME default applications are used for internet media types handling. The user configures these, centrally, in GNOME&#x27;s settings app.

The built-in preference manager for Web presents basic browser-specific settings while advanced settings which could radically alter Web&#x27;s behavior can be changed with utilities such as dconf (command line) and dconf-editor (graphical).

Web follows the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and platform-wide design decisions. For example, in Web 3.4, the menu for application actions was moved to the GNOME Shell&#x27;s top panel application menu and the menu bar was replaced with &quot;super menu&quot; button, which triggers the display of window-specific menu entries.

Since GNOME 3.32, Web can adjust to various form factors with the help of Libadwaita. It supports desktop, tablet and phone form factors. (&quot;Narrow Mode&quot;).

=== Ad blocking ===
Since GNOME 3.18, Web is configured to block ads and pop-ups by default. In GNOME 3.34, the existing ad blocker was removed. This code was only partially functional and had been the source of many bugs. Web adopted the &quot;Content Blockers&quot; system from the WebKit engine.

One of the developers, Adrián Pérez de Castro, compared the old and new ad blockers. He found that the switch saved approximately 80 MiB of RAM per browser tab.

=== Google Safe Browsing and security sandboxing ===
Since GNOME 3.28, Web has support for Google Safe Browsing, to help prevent users from visiting malicious websites.

Since GNOME 3.34, Web explicitly requires a minimum of WebKitGTK 2.26 or later. This provides the &quot;Bubblewrap Sandbox&quot; for tab processes, which is intended to prevent malicious websites from hijacking the browser and using it to spy on other tabs or run malicious code on the user&#x27;s computer. If such code found another exploit in the operating system allowing it to become root, the result could be a disaster for all users of the system.

Making the sandbox a priority was brought on, according to Michael Catanzaro, because he was particularly concerned with the code quality of OpenJPEG and the numerous security problems that had been discovered in it, including many years of failing security reviews by Ubuntu. He further explained that web compatibility requires that sites believe that Web is a major browser. Sending them the user agent of Apple Safari causes fewer broken websites than others (due to sharing the WebKit engine), but also causes caching servers to deliver JPEG 2000 images, of which Safari is the only major browser to support. There is no other usable open source option for JPEG 2000 support. Fixing OpenJPEG, which is the official reference software, will be a massive undertaking that could take years to sort out. Enabling the Bubblewrap Sandbox would cause many vulnerabilities in this and other components to become &quot;minimally useful&quot; to potential attackers.

In GNOME 3.36, Web gained native support for PDF documents by using PDF.js. Michael Catanzaro explained that having websites open Evince to display PDF files was insecure, as it could be used to escape the browser&#x27;s security sandbox. Since Evince was the last user of NPAPI, this allowed the remaining support code for the obsolete plug-in model (where additional vulnerabilities could be hiding) to be removed. Since the NPAPI support had a hard dependency on X11, moving to PDF.js also allowed that dependency to be dropped.

Since PDF.js internally converts PDF documents so that they can be displayed by the web browser&#x27;s engine, it does not add security vulnerabilities to the browser the way that compiled plug-ins such as Adobe Acrobat or Evince could.

=== Bookmark management ===
While most browsers feature a hierarchical folder-based bookmark system, Web uses categorized bookmarks, where a single bookmark (e.g. this page) can exist in multiple categories (such as &quot;Web Browsers&quot;, &quot;GNOME&quot;, and &quot;Computer Software&quot;). A special category includes bookmarks that have not yet been categorized. Bookmarks, along with browsing history, are accessed from the address bar in find-as-you-type manner.

==== Smart bookmarks ====
Another innovative concept supported by Web (though originally from Galeon) is &quot;smart bookmarks&quot;. These take a single argument specified from the address bar, or from a textbox in a toolbar.

=== Web Application Mode ===

Since GNOME 3.2, released in September 2011, Web allows creating application launchers for web applications. The subsequent invocation of a launcher brings up a plain site-specific browser (single instance) of Web limited to one domain, with off-site links opening in a normal browser. The launcher created this way is accessible from the desktop and is not limited to GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web&#x27;s developers. Similar features can be found in the Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.

Web applications are managed within the browser&#x27;s main instance. The applications can be deleted from the page, accessible with a special URI about:applications. This approach was supposed to be a temporary while a centralized GNOME web application management was to be implemented in GNOME 3.4, but this never happened.

=== Firefox Sync ===
Since GNOME 3.26, Web has support for Firefox Sync, which allows users to sync their bookmarks, history, passwords, and open tabs with Firefox Sync, which can then be shared between any copy of Firefox or Web that the user signs into Firefox Sync with.

=== Extensions === 
Web once supported extensions and a package was maintained containing the official ones. This was later removed due to problems with stability and maintainability.

Some popular extensions, such as ad blocking, were moved to the core application.

The project has expressed an interest in implementing support for the WebExtension add-on format used by Chrome, Firefox, and some other major browsers, if interested contributors can be found. Experimental support for WebExtensions was introduced in GNOME 43.

== Reception ==
In reviewing the WebKit-powered Epiphany 2.28 in September 2009, Ryan Paul of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; said &quot;Epiphany is quite snappy in GNOME 2.28 and scores 100/100 on the Acid3 test. Using WebKit will help differentiate Epiphany from Firefox, which is shipped as the default browser by most of the major Linux distributors.&quot;

In reviewing Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010, Jack Wallen described it as &quot;efficient, but different&quot; and noted its problem with crashes. &quot;When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn&#x27;t like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won&#x27;t work on a lot of sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won&#x27;t be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser).&quot; Wallen concluded positively about the browser, &quot;Although Epiphany hasn&#x27;t fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [It has a] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface.&quot;

In March 2011, Veronica Henry reviewed Epiphany 2.32, saying &quot;To be fair, this would be a hard sell as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn&#x27;t even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need to fire up a lightning-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick.&quot; She further noted, &quot;Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail&#x27;s pace. So, one of the first things I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast.&quot; Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.

In April 2012, Ryan Paul of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; used Web as an example to his criticism of GNOME 3.4 design decisions: &quot;Aside from the poor initial discoverability of the panel menu, this model works reasonably well for simple applications. [...] Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t scale well in complex applications. The best example of where this approach can pose difficulties is in GNOME&#x27;s default Web browser. [...] Having the application&#x27;s functionality split across two completely separate menus does not constitute a usability improvement.&quot; This was addressed in later versions, with a single unified menu.

In an October 2016 review, Bertel King Jr. noted on &quot;MakeUseOf&quot;, &quot;Later versions offer the best integration you will find with GNOME Shell. It lacks the add-ons found in mainstream browsers, but some users will like the minimalism, the speed, and the tab isolation that prevents one misbehaving site from crashing the entire browser.&quot;

In an April 2019 review, Bertel King Jr. wrote another article on &quot;MakeUseOf&quot;, this time reviewing GNOME Web for its Web Applications Mode. He stated, &quot;When you check your email, you’re using a web app. If you open YouTube, Netflix, or Spotify in a browser, again, you’re using a web app. These days, you can replace most of your desktop apps with web apps. [...] GNOME Web provides tools to better integrate web apps with the rest of your desktop, so you can open them via your app launcher and view them in your dock or taskbar. This way they feel more like apps and less like sites.&quot; He also praised the security provided by walling off Web Applications from the rest of the browser and each other. Like Mozilla&#x27;s container feature, this helps prevent sites such as Facebook from seeing what the user is doing in the main browser. It also allows the user to create multiple &quot;apps&quot; for the same site, to easily switch between different accounts.

<text>Pango (stylized as Παν語) is a text (i.e. glyph) layout engine library which works with the HarfBuzz shaping engine for displaying multi-language text.

Full-function rendering of text and cross-platform support is achieved when Pango is used with platform APIs or third-party libraries, such as Uniscribe and FreeType, as text rendering backends. Pango-processed text will appear similar under different operating systems.

Pango is a special-purpose library for text and not a general-purpose graphics rendering library such as Cairo, with which Pango can be used. The Cairo documentation recommends Pango be used to &quot;render&quot; text rather than Cairo for all but the simplest text &quot;rendering&quot;.

== History and naming ==
The name pango comes from Greek &quot;pan&quot; (, ) and Japanese &quot;go&quot; (, ).

In January 2000, the merger of the GScript and GnomeText projects was named Pango.

Pango version 1.0.0 was released 11 March 2002.

==Support for OpenType features==
Pango 1.17 and newer support the &quot; feature tag that allows localized glyphs to be used for the same Unicode code point. Assuming you have Verdana version 5.01 installed, which supports the &#x27;locl&#x27; feature for the latn/ROM (Romanian) script, a quick demonstration (on Linux) is:

for lang in en ro
do
 pango-view \
 --font=&quot;Verdana 64&quot; \
 --text &quot;şţ vs. șț in $lang&quot; \
 --language=$lang
done
For an explanation of the substitutions rules for Romanian, see this discussion.

Setting the locale via the POSIX environment variable, e.g. LANG=ro_RO.UTF-8 will also cause Pango to use &#x27;locl&#x27; font feature. Finally, you can change the language on the fly in the same text using Pango markup, e.g.:

pango-view \
 --font=&quot;Verdana 24&quot; \
 --markup \
 --text &#x27;In the same text: şţ(en) and &lt;span lang=&quot;ro&quot;&gt;şţ(ro).&lt;/span&gt;&#x27;
Since 1.37.1, Pango added more attributes to provide complete support for processing OpenType feature.

The official showcase of Pango&#x27;s script-aware features is here.

==Major users==
Pango has been integrated into most Linux distributions. The GTK UI toolkit uses Pango for all of its text rendering. The Linux versions of the Mozilla Firefox web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird mail client use Pango for text rendering.

<doc id="224281" wikidata="Q194501" url="?curid=224281" title="Gedit">
<text>gedit ( or ) is a text editor designed for the GNOME desktop environment. It was GNOME&#x27;s default text editor and part of the GNOME Core Applications until GNOME version 42 in March 2022, which changed the default text editor to GNOME Text Editor. Designed as a general-purpose text editor, gedit emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, with a clean and simple GUI, according to the philosophy of the GNOME project. It includes tools for editing source code and structured text such as markup languages.

It is free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.

gedit is also available for macOS and Windows.

By July 2017, gedit was not being maintained by any developers, but in August 2017 two developers volunteered to commence work on it again.

==Features==
gedit includes syntax highlighting via GtkSourceView for various program code and text markup formats including MediaWiki. gedit also has GUI tabs for editing multiple files. Tabs can be moved between various windows by the user. It can edit remote files using GVfs libraries; (GnomeVFS is now deprecated). It supports a full undo and redo system, search and replace as well as replace all. Other typical code oriented features include line numbering, bracket matching, text wrapping, current line highlighting, automatic indentation and automatic file backup.

The features of gedit include multi language spell checking via Enchant and a flexible plugin system allowing the addition of new features, for example snippets and integration with external applications including a Python or Bash terminal. A number of plugins are included in gedit itself, with more plugins in the gedit-plugins package and online.

Since version 3.20 gedit uses gspell for spell checking.

gedit has an optional side pane displaying the list of open files and (in a different tab of the side pane) a file browser. It also has an optional bottom pane with a Python console and (using gedit-plugins) terminal. gedit automatically detects when an open file is modified on disk by another application and offers to reload that file. Using a plugin (in gedit-plugins package), gedit can save and load sessions, which are lists of currently open tabs.

gedit supports printing, including print preview and printing to PostScript and PDF files. Printing options include text font, and page size, orientation, margins, optional printing of page headers and line numbers, as well as syntax highlighting.

In late 2013 and early 2014 the application received major upgrades for Gnome 3.12, with a new, cleaner user interface and code base improvements to make it work better with other desktop interfaces, such as Unity.

==Architecture==

Being part of the GNOME Core Applications, gedit 3 uses the GTK 3.x and GNOME 3.x libraries. The GNOME integration includes drag and drop to and from GNOME Files.

gedit uses the GNOME help system for documentation. It also uses virtual file system and GNOME printing framework.

In December 2008, gedit binaries were made available for macOS and Windows.

The last version for Windows 32-bit was 2.30.1, released in 2014. Standalone releases for 64-bit Windows continued, with Version 3.20.1 released in 2016.

Current versions of gedit (3.0+) for Windows are also available through MSYS2 and can be installed via the built-in Pacman package manager.

<doc id="224282" wikidata="Q1059510" url="?curid=224282" title="Duke of Rothesay">
<text>Duke of Rothesay ( ; ; ) is the main dynastic title traditionally given to the male heir apparent to the Scottish and, later, British thrones. The dukedom was created in 1398 by Robert III of Scotland for his eldest son.

Duke of Rothesay is the title mandated for use by the heir apparent when in Scotland, in preference to the titles &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Duke of Cornwall&quot;, which are used in the rest of the United Kingdom and overseas. The title is named after Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, but is not associated with any legal entity or landed property. The Duke of Rothesay also holds other Scottish titles, including Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.

The current holder of the title is William, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Catherine, is the current Duchess of Rothesay.

==History==
David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, the son of Robert III of Scotland, first held the dukedom from its creation in 1398. After his death, his brother James, later King James I, received the dukedom. Thereafter, the heir apparent to the Scottish Crown held the dukedom; an Act of the Parliament of Scotland passed in 1469 confirmed this pattern of succession.

The Earldom of Carrick existed as early as the 12th century. In 1306, Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, became King Robert I of Scotland, with the earldom merging in the Crown. In the following years, successive Kings of Scotland created several heirs apparent Earl of Carrick. The Act of 1469 finally settled the earldom on the eldest son of the Scottish monarch.

The office of the Great Steward of Scotland (also called High Steward or Lord High Steward) dates back to its first holder, Walter fitz Alan, in the 12th century. The seventh Great Steward, Robert, ascended the Scottish throne as Robert II in 1371. Thereafter, only the heirs apparent to the Crown held the office. The 1469 Act also deals with this.

Between the 1603 union of the crowns and Edward VII&#x27;s time as heir apparent, the style &quot;Duke of Rothesay&quot; appears to have dropped out of usage in favour of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Queen Victoria mandated the title for use to refer to the eldest son and heir apparent when in Scotland, and this usage has continued since. This may have been as a result, direct or indirect, of the 1822 visit of King George IV to Scotland.

==Lord of the Isles==

Another of the non-peerage titles belonging to the heir apparent, that of &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, merits special mention. The Lords of the Isles, of the MacDonald family, originally functioned as vassals of the Scottish, or Norwegian, kings who ruled the Western Isles. The ambitious John MacDonald II, fourth Lord of the Isles, made a secret treaty in 1462 with King Edward IV of England, by which he sought to make himself an independent ruler.

In 1475, James III discovered the Lord of the Isles&#x27; actions, and the Lordship became subject to forfeiture. MacDonald later regained his position, but James IV again deprived him of his titles in 1493 after his nephew provoked a rebellion. In 1540 James V of Scotland granted the Lordship to the heirs apparent to the Crown.

==Legal basis==
An Act of the Parliament of Scotland passed in 1469 governs the succession to most of these titles. It provides that &quot;the first-born Prince of the King of Scots for ever&quot; should hold the dukedom. If the firstborn Prince dies before the King, the title is not inherited by his heir – it is only for the firstborn son, like the Duchy of Cornwall – nor is either inherited by the deceased duke&#x27;s next brother, unless that brother also becomes heir apparent. Though the Act specified &quot;King&quot;, eldest sons of queens regnant subsequently also held the dukedom. The interpretation of the word &quot;Prince&quot;, however, does not include women. Therefore, in the event of an heiress presumptive or heiress apparent (this being a distinct and even likely possibility in the future after the passage of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013), she cannot become Duchess of Rothesay.

The eldest son of the British Sovereign, as Duke of Rothesay, had the right to vote in elections for Scottish representative peers from 1707. (The 1707 Acts of Union between the Parliament of Scotland and Parliament of England formally unified both kingdoms to create the Kingdom of Great Britain.) This right continued until 1963, when the UK Parliament abolished the election of representative peers.

==Current holder==

Since 2022 William, Prince of Wales, has held the title of Duke of Rothesay, and uses it when in Scotland. He has the formal Scottish style of &quot;HRH The Prince William, Duke of Rothesay&quot;.

The personal arms of the preceding Duke were bestowed upon him in 1974 by the Queen. The escutcheon features on the 1st and 4th quarters the arms of the Great Steward of Scotland, with the 2nd and 3rd quarters featuring the arms of the Lord of the Isles. The arms of the current Duke are distinguished from those of Clan Stewart of Appin through the addition of an inescutcheon displaying the arms of the heir apparent to the King of Scots, namely the Royal arms of Scotland with a three-point label. The full achievement of the current Duke&#x27;s arms are a variation of the Royal coat of arms of Scotland used prior to the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

<doc id="224289" wikidata="Q1418467" url="?curid=224289" title="Ha (mythology)">
<text>Ha (), in ancient Egyptian religion, was a god of the &quot;Western Desert and the fertile oasis of Western Desert of Egypt&quot;. He was associated with the Duat (the underworld) and pictured as a man wearing the hieroglyph symbol for desert hills on his head.

Ha was said to protect Egypt from enemies such as invading ancient Libyans. He is associated with Set, since Set represented the west of the Nile and they both have similar attributes - the desert.

==Worship==
It is unknown when Ha was worshipped in ancient Egypt. But at first he was the &quot;god of fertility&quot;, son of an almost unknown deity named Iaaw, but in the later period of Egypt, he took his place by removing the western desert god Ash. He was later shown as the symbol of the west, while Sopdu was the symbol of the east, and Dedun the symbol of the south. The ancient Egyptians saw him as a guardian deity of the pharaoh. The inscription on the pyramids of Unas shows him as the &quot;protector of the dead pharaoh&quot;.

==Other Associations==
The dinosaur &quot;Hagryphus&quot; (&quot;Ha&#x27;s griffin&quot;) was named after Ha; it was discovered in Utah and Ha&#x27;s association with the western deserts was carried over to the deserts of the Southwestern United States.

<text>National Science Digital Library (NSDL) of the United States is an open-access online digital library and collaborative network of disciplinary and grade-level focused education providers operated by the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education. NSDL&#x27;s mission is to provide quality digital learning collections to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education community, both formal and informal, institutional and individual. NSDL&#x27;s collections are refined by a network of STEM educational and disciplinary professionals. Their work is based on user data, disciplinary knowledge, and participation in the evolution of digital resources as major elements of effective STEM learning.

Resource types available via NSDL include instructional materials, activities, lesson plans, audio/video materials, images, web sites, simulations, visualizations, tools, and services. NSDL also provides annotation collection and paradata (usage data) collections: comments, ratings, or usage information attached to existing resources in the NSDL.

== Activities ==
* Learning Registry: The NSDL is a partner in the national Learning Registry project to facilitate the exchange of resources, metadata about resources, and paradata about their use in learning environments. NSDL is contributing to this multi-agency federal project designed to make learning resources produced by federal funding more accessible.
* NSDL STEM Exchange: concept for a web service to capture and share social media-generated information and other networked associations about educational resources (tagged, recommended, commented, discussed, clicked, viewed, downloaded, favorited, shared, etc.)
* Learning Application Readiness - an NSDL initiative that refers to how closely educational resources, collections, and their related metadata are aligned to educational goals, curriculum, or professional development needs of users, and how readily those can be embedded in tools and services that teachers and students use.
* &quot;Repositioning NSDL for the Next Generation of Digital Learning&quot; - An NSDL NSF-funded project building on and leveraging the lessons of prior work (NSDL network partners collaborations;; Learning Registry collaboration; ; Common Core Mathematics collection) to bring pilot level projects to scale and to integrate new STEM education services into NSDL. These efforts contribute to NSDL&#x27;s sustainability through diffusion and adoption of resources into a wider range of instructional settings and teacher peer-to-peer networks.

== History ==

The National Science Digital Library (NSDL) was established in 2000 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide an organized point of access to STEM content aggregated from a variety of other digital libraries, NSF-funded projects, and other national STEM stakeholder providers. Key collaborations with disciplinary communities and audience-focused providers grew out of the NSDL, providing a social and technical infrastructure for collaboration in the delivery and use of digital resources in STEM education 
. NSDL also provides access to services and tools that enhance the use of this content in a variety of contexts. NSDL is designed primarily for K-16 educators, but anyone can access NSDL.org and search the library at no cost, and without creating a user account, although some content providers require a nominal fee or subscription to retrieve their specific resources.

From 2000 – 2011, the National Science Foundation sponsored an NSDL grant-making program in the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) of the Education and Human Resources Directorate. The National STEM Distributed Learning (NSDL) program offered grants to support major collection-building efforts, services development, and targeted research that built and extended library services. In February 2011, the NSF ended the NSDL grant-making program in DUE, and did not issue an NSDL program solicitation for FY2011.

Originally a collaboration between Cornell University, Columbia University, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), the NSDL became entirely hosted at UCAR, in Boulder, Colorado. In 2014, the NSDL was transferred to the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education.

<text>Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) is the center for oceanography and Earth science at the University of California, San Diego. Its main campus is located in La Jolla, with additional facilities in Point Loma.

Founded in 1903 and incorporated into the University of California system in 1912, the institution has since broadened its research focus to encompass the physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and climate of the Earth. The institution awards the Nierenberg Prize annually to recognize researchers with exceptional contributions to science in public interest.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Scripps Institution of Oceanography can trace its beginnings back to William Ritter, a biologist originally from Wisconsin. In 1891, Ritter was offered a job teaching biology at the University of California, Berkeley and married Mary Bennett. Their honeymoon and subsequent biological studies took them to San Diego, where Ritter met a local physician and naturalist, Fred Baker, who would later encourage him to build a marine biological laboratory in San Diego.

Ritter searched for eleven years for an appropriate place for a permanent marine biological laboratory. He spent summers at various places along the coast with students. His goal was frustrated by lack of money and lack of an appropriate place. During this time, research was being conducted at the boathouse of Hotel del Coronado on San Diego Bay.

In 1903, Ritter was introduced to newspaper magnate E. W. Scripps. Together with Scripps&#x27; half-sister Ellen Browning Scripps and Baker, they formed the Marine Biological Association of San Diego with Ritter as the Scientific Director. They fully funded the institution for its first decade. E. W. Scripps gave the biological association the use of his yacht, the &quot;Loma&quot;, in 1904 and served as the first research vessel in the history of the institution. In 1905, they moved to a small laboratory in La Jolla Cove until they arranged for the purchase of a site in La Jolla, north of San Diego. The land was purchased for $1,000 at a public auction from the city of San Diego (the same site where the SIO main campus is today). However, construction cost estimates for a permeant building were around $50,000. Funding was secured through E. W. and E. B. Scripps, and the first permanent building (today known as the Old Scripps Building) was constructed in 1910.

The Marine Biological Association&#x27;s first seafaring vessel, the &quot;Loma&quot;, would run aground in Point Loma in 1906 and prompted the search for a new one. With funds secured from Ellen Browning Scripps, the association was able to have a ship built by Lawrence Jensen strictly for oceanographic research - among the first for an American nongovernmental institution. The new vessel was acquired on April 21st, 1907 and was named the &quot;Alexander Agassiz&quot; after the Harvard biologist who had visited in 1905. The 85-foot &quot;Alexander Agassiz&quot;, a sailing vessel with twin gasoline engines, served the institution for ten years.

In 1912, the Biological Association became incorporated into the University of California and was renamed the Scripps Institution for Biological Research.

<doc id="224300" wikidata="Q895404" url="?curid=224300" title="Bowen ratio">
<text>The Bowen ratio is used to describe the type of heat transfer for a surface that has moisture. Heat transfer can either occur as sensible heat (differences in temperature without evapotranspiration) or latent heat (the energy required during a change of state, without a change in temperature). The Bowen ratio is generally used to calculate heat lost (or gained) in a substance; it is the ratio of energy fluxes from one state to another by sensible heat and latent heating respectively.

The ratio was named by Harald Sverdrup after Ira Sprague Bowen (1898–1973), an astrophysicist whose theoretical work on evaporation to air from water bodies made first use of it, and it is used most commonly in meteorology and hydrology. 

==Formulation==
The Bowen ratio is calculated by the equation: 

: formula_1, where formula_2 is sensible heating and formula_3 is latent heating.

In this context, when the magnitude of formula_4 is less than one, a greater proportion of the available energy at the surface is passed to the atmosphere as latent heat than as sensible heat, and the converse is true for values of formula_4 greater than one. As formula_6, however, formula_4 becomes unbounded making the Bowen ratio a poor choice of variable for use in formulae, especially for arid surfaces. For this reason the evaporative fraction is sometimes a more appropriate choice of variable representing the relative contributions of the turbulent energy fluxes to the surface energy budget.

The Bowen ratio is related to the evaporative fraction, formula_8, through the equation,

: formula_9.

The Bowen ratio is an indicator of the type of surface. The Bowen ratio, formula_10, is less than one over surfaces with abundant water supplies.
