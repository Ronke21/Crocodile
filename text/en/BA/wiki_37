<doc id="217160" wikidata="Q361450" url="?curid=217160" title="Haley Barbour">
<text>Haley Reeves Barbour (born October 22, 1947) is an American attorney, politician, and lobbyist who served as the 63rd governor of Mississippi from 2004 to 2012. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997.

Born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, Barbour graduated from the University of Mississippi with undergraduate and law degrees, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Barbour was an active Republican operative during the 1970s and 1980s, and he is often credited with building significant Republican infrastructure in Mississippi during an era when it was still dominated by Southern Democrats. He was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in 1982, but lost to incumbent Democrat John C. Stennis.

In 2003, Barbour became the second Republican governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction when he defeated Democratic incumbent Ronnie Musgrove. As governor he oversaw his state&#x27;s responses to Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the state&#x27;s two most damaging environmental disasters since the 1927 Mississippi River floods. Barbour was expected to be a candidate for president in 2012, but announced he would not run in April 2011.

Since retiring as governor, Barbour has resumed lobbying as a senior partner at BGR Group, which he co-founded in 1991. He has been described as &quot;one of Washington&#x27;s all-time mega-lobbyists&quot;. His clients have often included foreign governments, oil, and tobacco companies. Barbour currently co-chairs the Immigration Task Force at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

==Early years==
Barbour was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he was raised as the youngest of three sons of Grace LeFlore (née Johnson) and Jeptha Fowlkes Barbour, Jr. Haley&#x27;s father, a lawyer, died when Barbour was two years old. Barbour&#x27;s father was a Circuit Judge who had an inmate, Leon Turner, assist him after Judge Barbour became ill. As governor, Haley later gave Turner, who had helped raise him, a posthumous pardon in the closing days of his administration.

His brother Jeptha Fowlkes Barbour III was elected mayor of Yazoo City in 1968 as an independent and served until 1972.

He enrolled at the University of Mississippi School of Law, receiving a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1972.

Subsequently, Barbour joined his father&#x27;s old law firm in Yazoo City. He was also a law partner of his cousin, William H. Barbour Jr., who later became a federal district judge.

==Early political career==

Barbour soon became prominent within the Republican party running Gerald Ford&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign in the Southeast. He also worked on the campaign of former Texas governor John Connally, who had become a Republican, for president in 1980. In 1982 Barbour was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate election in Mississippi, but was defeated 64% to 36% by longtime incumbent John C. Stennis, a conservative Democrat, despite an endorsement by President Ronald Reagan. During the campaign, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a Barbour aide complained about &quot;coons&quot; at a campaign event. Barbour, embarrassed that the comment was overheard by a reporter, told the aide that he would be &quot;reincarnated as a watermelon and placed at the mercy of blacks&quot; if he continued making racist comments. As of 2023, Barbour is the last Republican to have lost a Senate election in Mississippi.

Barbour later served as a political aide in the Reagan Administration and worked on the 1988 presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush.

Before being elected governor of Mississippi, Barbour &quot;had a long career on the national stage&quot; and was &quot;well-known as a Republican operative since the Reagan years&quot;.

==Lobbying career==
Barbour has been described as &quot;one of Washington&#x27;s all-time mega-lobbyists&quot;. He &quot;was a wealthy K Street lobbyist for giant corporations such as RJ Reynolds, Philip Morris, Amgen, Microsoft, United Health, Southern Company, and many others.&quot; In 1991, Barbour helped found the lobbying group now known as BGR Group, a Washington, D.C.–based lobbying firm, with Ed Rogers, a lawyer who formerly worked in the George H. W. Bush administration. In 1994, Lanny Griffith (also a former Bush administration appointee) joined the firm.

In 1998, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers as the second-most-powerful lobbying firm in America. In 2001, after the inauguration of George W. Bush, &quot;Fortune&quot; called it the most powerful. The firm &quot;is employed by several foreign countries, as well as oil and cigarette companies&quot;. Its role in advocating on behalf of the tobacco industry has been particularly prominent. BGR also &quot;lobbied on behalf of the Embassy of Mexico in 2001 to promote a bill related to Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This provision would have provided a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United States, through family connections or job skills, without a requirement that they return to their home country for the requisite 3-10 years. This is what&#x27;s often referred to as &#x27;amnesty.&#x27;&quot; &quot;As part of that work, Barbour&#x27;s firm arranged meetings and briefings with &#x27;Senators, members of Congress and their staffs, as well as Executive Branch Officials in the White House, National Security Council, State Department, and Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service&#x27;. Barbour&#x27;s firm charged Mexico $35,000 a month, plus expenses.&quot;

As of 2010, the firm remained one of DC&#x27;s top 25, but had seen revenues drop both in 2009 and in 2010. As of 2011, Barbour continued to &quot;collect payments from BGR through a blind trust, which was recently valued at $3.3 million&quot;.

In early 2014, Barbour and his nephew, Henry Barbour, formed a Super PAC named Mississippi Conservatives, which supported the successful reelection campaign of Senator Thad Cochran.

==RNC chairman==
In 1993, Barbour became chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). In 1994, during his tenure as RNC chair, Republicans captured both houses of the United States Congress, taking the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. In 1997, Barbour retired from his position as chairman of the RNC.

==Governor of Mississippi==

===2003 campaign===

After two decades in Washington, D.C., Barbour announced his intention to run for governor of Mississippi in 2003. On August 5, 2003, Barbour won the Republican gubernatorial primary over Canton trial attorney Mitch Tyner. Barbour&#x27;s campaign manager was his nephew Henry Barbour.

During the campaign, a controversy arose when Barbour chose to speak at the Blackhawk Rally, a fundraiser for the Blackhawk &quot;council school&quot; in Blackhawk, Mississippi. Such &quot;council schools&quot;, also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as &quot;academies&quot;, were established by the White Citizens&#x27; Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the Civil Rights Movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that &quot;Once you start down the slippery slope of saying, &#x27;That person can&#x27;t be for me,&#x27; then where do you stop? ... I don&#x27;t care who has my picture. My picture&#x27;s in the public domain.&quot; Barbour&#x27;s Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk rallies.

Barbour defeated incumbent Musgrove in the general election on November 4, 2003, with 53 percent of the vote to Musgrove&#x27;s 46 percent. Barbour became just the second Republican governor elected in Mississippi since Reconstruction, the first being Kirk Fordice.

Barbour took office in January 2004.

===Fiscal matters===
Barbour has been praised for translating his lobbying skills into success at winning over a legislature dominated by Democrats. Barbour has called several special legislative sessions to force an issue.

Writing for &quot;Reason&quot; magazine in February 2011, Damon Root expressed the opinion that Barbour supports farm subsidies, corporate welfare, and eminent domain. When he took office, the state of Mississippi had run a $709 million budget deficit for the 2004 fiscal year. With bipartisan support, and without raising taxes, Barbour implemented a plan called Operation: Streamline to cut the budget deficit in half. He accomplished this largely by reducing spending on social services, most notably Medicaid; the 2005 budget drastically reduced coverage for 65,000 individuals classified as Poverty-Level Aged and Disabled (PLAD), most of whom qualified for the federal Medicare program, and also significantly limited prescription drug coverage. However, the same budget increased the percentage of Medicaid prescriptions that are for generic drugs. In 2005, the state was budgeted to spend a total of $130 million less on Medicaid than in the previous year. This trend continued in the state budget for the 2006 fiscal year. After a long special session, the legislature approved a budget that featured more social service cuts but also increased educational spending. With tax revenues higher than expected during the 2006 fiscal year, due in large part to increased sales tax revenues in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the state achieved its first balanced budget in years. In the 2008 fiscal year budget, for the first time since its enactment in 1997, the state fully funded the Mississippi Adequate Education Program.

Building on a 2002 tort reform bill passed by his predecessor, Barbour also introduced a new tort reform measure that has been described as one of the strictest in the nation. Barbour rarely made a speech during his gubernatorial campaign without mentioning this subject and was able to convert political support into law, overcoming the resistance of House Democratic leaders, who argued that further legislation would disenfranchise people with legitimate complaints against corporations. Barbour then embarked on a &quot;tort tour&quot; to encourage other states to follow Mississippi&#x27;s lead. &quot;We&#x27;ve gone from being labeled as a judicial hellhole and the center of jackpot justice to a state that now has model legislation,&quot; commented Charlie Ross, the chair of the Mississippi Senate&#x27;s Judiciary Committee.

The effectiveness of Barbour&#x27;s tort reform efforts has been questioned. According to conservative journalist Timothy Carney, he &quot;touts job growth down in Mississippi under his governing, and some of that is due to tort reform, but some of it is due to rank favoritism and special-interest deals more akin to Obama than Reagan — for instance, subsidies for a biofuels plant.&quot;

Through his entire terms, Barbour&#x27;s Commissioner of Corrections was Chris Epps, who had been appointed on August 30, 2002 by Democratic Governor Ronnie Musgrove. Republican governors Barbour and Phil Bryant reappointed Epps on January 13, 2004 and January 11, 2012, respectively. On November 6, 2014, it was revealed by federal prosecutors in the FBI&#x27;s Operation Mississippi Hustle sting that Epps and a confederate, former Republican state House member Cecil McCrory, had taken bribes from many for-profit prison operators, consultants, vendors and subcontractors for other prisoner services. The amounts Epps personally received were estimated to be at least $1.47 million in bribes for steering what Assistant US Attorney LaMarca estimated was $800 million in contracts between 2006 and 2014. Epps cooperated with the prosecution and wore a wire for a substantial amount of time before their indictments were made public. Before federal Judge Henry Travillion Wingate pronounced his sentence in July 2017, Epps asked forgiveness of the many he had harmed. He said, &quot;It comes back to greed. I made some stupid mistakes I will regret for the rest of my life.&quot; Judge Wingate characterized Epps&#x27; conduct as, &quot;staggering.&quot; He continued, &quot;Mississippi is still in shock. It was an act of betrayal. He has bruised the image of Mississippi and given joy to many of the inmates he’s overseen who can now say the head of the state prison system was just as corrupt as any of them.&quot; He sentenced Epps to over 19 years in federal prison. On February 8, 2017, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat, announced he had filed civil cases against 15 corporations and individuals who had engaged in contracts with the MDOC and Epps, seeking damages and punitive damages. He stated, 
&quot;The state of Mississippi has been defrauded through a pattern of bribery, kickbacks, misrepresentations, fraud, concealment, money laundering and other wrongful conduct.&quot; He continued, &quot;These individuals and corporations that benefited by stealing from taxpayers must not only pay the state&#x27;s losses, but state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state. We are also seeking punitive damages to punish these conspirators and to deter those who might consider giving or receiving kickbacks in the future.&quot; Defendants in the bribery cases included Management &amp; Training Corporation; The GEO Group, Inc.; Cornell Companies, Inc.; Wexford Health Sources, Inc.; Global Tel*Link Corporation; Health Assurance, LLC; Keefe Commissary Network, LLC of St. Louis; Sentinel Offender Services, L.L.C.; AJA Management &amp; Technical Services, Inc., and the Branan Medical Corporation; On May 18, 2017, Hood announced that the state had quickly settled the first suit for two million dollars. The defendant was Alere Incorporated, which had purchased the Branan Medical Corporation. Ten lawsuits in bribery schemes remained pending. Those have accused at least 10 individuals and 11 out-of-state corporations of using so-called &quot;consultants&quot; to gain more than $800 million in Mississippi prison contracts. On January 24, 2019, Hood announced his actions had recovered $27 million from those vendors against which he had filed suits. Management and Training Corporation paid $5.2 million. GEO Group paid $4.6 million, with the named defendant being Cornell Companies, which had been merged with GEO in 2010. Wexford Health Sources paid $4 million. Keefe Commissary Network paid $3.1 million. $3.1 million was paid by C.N.W. Construction Company. $750,000 was paid by CGL Facility Management, which provides maintenance services. $32,188 was received from AdminPros LLC, a Medicaid billing service. Insurance agent Guy E. &quot;Butch&quot; Evans paid $100,000.

===Hurricane Katrina response===
The evacuation order for Hurricane Katrina was issued by local officials more than 24 hours before it hit, and Mississippi activated 750 National Guard troops as of August 29, the day of the hurricane.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck Mississippi&#x27;s coast, killing 231 people, devastating the state&#x27;s $2.7 billion-a-year casino industry and leaving tens of thousands homeless. (see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Mississippi). Barbour&#x27;s response was characterized by a concerted effort at evacuation, tough-minded talk on looters and an unwillingness to blame the federal government. His response was likened, favorably, to that of Rudy Giuliani in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

Barbour credited the government workers who helped southern Mississippi to cope with the hurricane. Barbour was praised by the coast&#x27;s citizens as a strong leader who can communicate calmly to the public, and provide &quot;a central decision-making point for when things get balled up or go sideways, which they do&quot;, as Barbour says.

While the reconstruction process does not dictate how localities should rebuild, Barbour has touted New Urbanist principles in constructing more compact communities. &quot;They have the chance to build some things very differently,&quot; he says. &quot;The goal is to build the coast back like it can be, rather than simply like it was.&quot;

Barbour has been accused by Bloomberg News of personally profiting from Hurricane Katrina recovery. Barbour is an owner of the parent company of lobbying firm Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers Inc., and he receives a pension and profit-sharing plan benefits from it. The lobbying firm has lobbied the state to give recovery contracts to its clients. Some of the proceeds of the firm&#x27;s lobbying activities are deposited into Barbour&#x27;s investment account. According to Barbour&#x27;s attorney, a blind trust executed in 2004 prevents Barbour knowing the composition of his investments in order to eliminate any conflicts of interest.

===Tobacco matters===

Barbour has also received criticism from some Mississippi Democrats for his refusal to approve a bill to increase the cigarette tax and decrease the grocery tax passed by the Mississippi House of Representatives during his first term as governor. Mississippi currently has the third-lowest cigarette tax and the highest grocery tax—while being the poorest state in the country. He stated that the lack of revenue generated after the tax swap would quite possibly result in bankrupting the state government, which was already fragile due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The House of Representatives could produce no figures to dispute this assertion. Also, in his successful 2004 campaign, Barbour ran on the platform that he would veto any tax increase.

In May 2009, Barbour followed the State Tax Commission&#x27;s recommendation and signed into law the state&#x27;s first increase since 1985, from 18 cents to 68 cents per pack. The tax is estimated to generate more than $113 million for the year that begins July 1, 2009.

===2007 re-election===

Barbour announced on February 8, 2007, that he would seek a second term as Governor of Mississippi. Barbour announced the beginning of his re-election campaign at a series of meetings across the state on February 12, 2007. During his campaign, Barbour signed the Americans for Tax Reform &quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot; and vowed not to institute any new taxes or raise any existing ones.

Barbour defeated Frederick Jones in the Republican primary on August 7 and Democrat John Arthur Eaves Jr. in the November general election.

===Race and integration===
Barbour has faced considerable &quot;in-state criticism for his approach to racial issues&quot;. Mississippi state Representative Willie Perkins has &quot;compared Barbour to the southern Democrats who preceded him&quot;, saying: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, he has never done anything as a governor or a citizen to distinguish himself from the old Democrats who fought tooth and nail to preserve segregation.&quot;

In 2006, he declined to posthumously pardon Clyde Kennard, an African-American civil rights pioneer, after evidence was presented that Kennard had been falsely convicted of burglary in Hattiesburg, Mississippi in 1960. Instead, Barbour designated a Clyde Kennard Day, calling for remembrance of Kennard&#x27;s &quot;determination, the injustices he suffered, and his significant role in the history of the civil rights movement in Mississippi&quot;. Barbour subsequently joined in a petition for a court rehearing of the case that resulted in the original conviction being thrown out.

Barbour proved instrumental in winning state legislative support for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. Legislation to fund a state museum had been introduced every year since 2000, but died for various reasons. In November 2006, Barbour proposed creating a state commission to develop plans for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. In his &quot;State of the State&quot; address on January 16, 2007, Barbour said the museum was &quot;overdue, and it needs doing&quot;, The proposal won legislative approval, and a site for the museum was selected in March 2008. The project then stalled for three years, however, with museum backers listing lack of direction from the governor&#x27;s office and Barbour&#x27;s refusal to spend $500,000 in museum planning funds as part of the reason why. Barbour also declined to name a museum commission to oversee the final push for funding and construction. Following controversy over Barbour&#x27;s statements on White Citizens&#x27; Councils, the governor again declared his complete support for construction of the museum, in what many political observers felt was an attempt to dampen criticism over his remarks as well as to disassociate himself from Mississippi&#x27;s racially intolerant past. The museum secured $20 million in funding from the Mississippi Legislature in April 2011 after Barbour personally testified in favor of its funding.

During an April 11, 2010, appearance on CNN, host Candy Crowley asked if it had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month. Barbour replied, &quot;To me, it&#x27;s a sort of feeling that it&#x27;s a nit, that it is not significant, that it&#x27;s not a—it&#x27;s trying to make a big deal out of something doesn&#x27;t amount to diddly.&quot; Barbour continued, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you would say about slavery ... but anybody that thinks that you have to explain to people that slavery is a bad thing, I think that goes without saying.&quot;

In December 2010, Barbour was interviewed by &quot;The Weekly Standard &quot;magazine. Asked about coming of age in Yazoo City during the civil rights era, he told the interviewer regarding growing up there, &quot;I just don&#x27;t remember it as being that bad.&quot; Barbour then credited the White Citizens&#x27; Council for keeping the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) out of Yazoo City and ensuring the peaceful integration of its schools. Barbour dismissed comparisons between White Citizens&#x27; Councils and the KKK, and referred to the Councils as &quot;an organization of town leaders&quot;. Barbour continued in his defense of the Councils, saying, &quot;In Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their ass run out of town. If you had a job, you&#x27;d lose it. If you had a store, they&#x27;d see nobody shopped there. We didn&#x27;t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.&quot; Barbour&#x27;s statement did not address the role of the white supremacist Council in publicly naming and blacklisting individuals who petitioned for educational integration and how it used political pressure and violence to force African-American residents to move. This led to a considerable outcry in which critics such as Rachel Maddow accused Barbour of whitewashing history. In response to criticism, Barbour issued a statement declaring Citizens&#x27; Councils to be &quot;indefensible.&quot;

In what was speculated to be an attempt at damage control just days after the interview, Barbour suspended the prison sentences of Jamie and Gladys Scott, two African American women who each received two life sentences resulting from a 1993 mugging in which the two women allegedly conspired to steal what amounted to $11. Barbour has denied that there was any connection between the suspension of the Scott sisters&#x27; prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour&#x27;s decision to release the Scott sisters, however, was contingent upon her consent for the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics. The sisters were released in 2011, but by 2018 the transplant had not occurred because of other medical conditions suffered by the intended recipient.

===Other second term activities===
In September 2008, some Democrats accused Barbour of trying to influence the outcome of the 2008 Senate race by placing the candidates at the bottom of the ballot. Since Mississippi electoral law mandates the placing of federal elections at the top of the ballot, Barbour was ordered by a circuit court to comply with the ballot laws.

In April 2009, Barbour joined a conservative policy group to discuss Republican policies in town hall meetings. The group also included former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, and Senator John McCain.

On June 24, 2009, Barbour assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association, succeeding South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford. On October 29, 2009, Barbour endorsed Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Texas Republican gubernatorial nomination.

On March 3, 2010, Barbour and his wife participated in events with First Lady Michelle Obama, promoting the Let&#x27;s Move! anti-obesity campaign.

In March 2011, Barbour drew criticism for his role in allowing the release of a convicted killer eight years into a 20-year sentence. In prior years, Barbour had used his powers as governor to release five other killers.

===2012 pardons===
On his last day as governor in 2012, Barbour granted pardons, clemency, or early release to 203 people convicted of crimes, including murder, rape and armed robbery. Barbour&#x27;s actions included 19 people convicted of murder. Pardons by governors are not uncommon; the issue in this case is the number of pardons compared to former governors. Previous governor Ronnie Musgrove issued only one pardon, for a man convicted of marijuana possession; Governor Kirk Fordice, who preceded Musgrove, issued only two full pardons for convicted murderers.

Harry Bostick, whom Barbour pardoned, had been convicted of DUI three times, and at the time of his pardon was being held for (and subsequently pleaded guilty to) the DUI killing of Charity Smith.

On January 11, a Mississippi judge temporarily blocked the release of 21 inmates who had been given pardons or medical release. Attorney General Jim Hood argued the Mississippi Constitution says any inmate seeking a pardon must publish their intentions at least 30 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper in or near the county where the person was convicted. Hood also criticized Barbour for failing to notify or speak with the families of victims before granting the pardons. He responded to criticism of his actions, saying that 90% of those involved had already been released from prison, many years earlier; he acted in order to allow them to find employment, get professional licenses, vote and hunt. He also stated that in 90% of the cases his decision was based on recommendations of the parole board.

An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that a disproportionate number of pardons were granted to applicants from wealthy families and those with personal or political connections, a situation also observed in the pardon systems of other states.

On March 8, 2012, the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the pardons, which had been challenged based on the argument that many of them did not follow a requirement in the state constitution to publish notices in newspapers for 30 days. The Court wrote &quot;we are compelled to hold that – in each of the cases before us – it fell to the governor alone to decide whether the Constitution&#x27;s publication requirement was met.&quot; The court also said it could not overturn the pardons because of the constitution&#x27;s separation of powers of the different branches of government.

==Speculated 2012 presidential campaign==
After he visited Iowa in 2009, there was speculation that Barbour might run for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 2012. An advisor of Barbour stated, &quot;When he surveys what most Republicans consider to be a weak field, he sees no reason he couldn&#x27;t easily beat them. He&#x27;s a better strategist and fundraiser than any other candidate currently considering running—and just as good on television and in debates.&quot; While considering a potential run, Barbour stated forthrightly in February 2011, &quot;I&#x27;m a lobbyist&quot;, and said that his K Street past prepared him for the job.

Many commentators were skeptical of Barbour&#x27;s chances in 2012. David Broder of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;several others would have to stumble before he could get a serious consideration.&quot; Statistician Nate Silver argued that &quot;Barbour may have difficulty appealing to voters outside the South, especially after his recent comments about the civil rights era.&quot; &quot;Salon.com&quot; noted that &quot;Barbour has some serious baggage ... he&#x27;s lobbied on behalf of the Mexican government for amnesty. There&#x27;s also the issue of his freighted racial history, and whatever pragmatic concerns it raises for November-minded Republicans.&quot; Timothy Carney, reflecting on Barbour&#x27;s history as a lobbyist, concluded: &quot;If the Tea Party still has some wind, it&#x27;s hard to see how Barbour gets anywhere near the GOP nomination.&quot; On April 25, 2011, Barbour announced that he would not run for president in 2012.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
After leaving office as governor, Barbour joined Butler Snow, a Jackson, Mississippi law firm (together with his former Chief of Staff Paul Hurst); re-joined lobbying firm BGR Group; and became a client of speakers&#x27; bureau Leading Authorities. At a &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; breakfast in June 2012, Barbour suggested that the Republican Party should take a more moderate approach to certain elements of its platform. He suggested barring corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, expressed satisfaction with Mitt Romney&#x27;s moderate brand of Republicanism, and suggested that the party should soften its stance on illegal immigration and reach out to Latino voters: &quot;We need a secure border for lots of reasons, and then we need to recognize that we&#x27;re not going to deport 12 million people and we shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

During a private Crossroads fundraiser in Tampa in 2012, Barbour said, of the planned keynote address by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at the 2012 Republican National Convention, &quot;I would love for Christie to put a hot poker to Obama&#x27;s butt...&quot; He was criticized by some online commentators for the alleged racism of these remarks. He later apologized for his statement.

Barbour was stopped with a loaded handgun in a briefcase by TSA security at the Medgar Evers airport in Jackson on January 2, 2018 as he was boarding a flight for Washington, D.C.; he was briefly detained by airport police and said he would pay the associated fine. The governor said he forgot he had the gun there after an employee had removed it from his car days before.

==Public image==
Barbour maintained a positive approval rating in his state during periods when he was governor. A July 2010 Rasmussen Reports poll found that Barbour had a 70% approval rating in Mississippi.

==Awards and honors==
In 2009, Barbour was awarded the Honorary Patronage of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency headquarters building in Pearl, MS was named in his honor on January 5, 2012.

On October 18, 2012, The Center for Manufacturing Excellence at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi was named in his honor.

<text>Jackson State University (Jackson State or JSU) is a public historically black research university in Jackson, Mississippi. It is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

Jackson State University&#x27;s athletic teams, the Tigers, participate in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Jackson State is also the home of the Sonic Boom of the South, a marching band founded in the 1940s. Their accompanying danceline, the &quot;Prancing J-Settes&quot;, are well known for their unique style of dance, known as J-Setting.

==History==
Jackson State University developed from Natchez Seminary, founded October 23, 1877, in Natchez, Mississippi. The seminary was affiliated with the American Baptist Home Mission Society of New York, who established it &quot;for the moral, religious, and intellectual improvement of Christian leaders of the colored people of Mississippi and the neighboring states&quot;. In 1883, the school changed its name to Jackson College and moved from Natchez to a site in Jackson, the capital. The college moved to its current location early in the 20th century, where it developed into a full state university. Its original site in Jackson is now the location of Millsaps College.

In 1934, during the Great Depression, the Baptist Society withdrew financial support. The school became a state-supported public institution in 1940 as the Mississippi Negro Training School. The name has changed over time: Jackson College for Negro Teachers in 1944;. Jackson State College in 1967, after desegregation; and with the addition of graduate programs and expanded curriculum, Jackson State University in 1974.

Many students at Jackson State College became active in the civil rights movement. Work to gain integrated practice and social justice continued after civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. During an on-campus protest on May 14, 1970, two students were killed by police gunfire, and an additional 12 students injured by gunfire. A dormitory still bears the bullet marks fired on that day.

The university drew national attention in 2023 when the faculty senate voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in university president Thomas Hudson. They alleged that he &quot;repeatedly failed to respect shared governance, transparency, and accountability&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the university&#x27;s board of trustees placed Hudson on administrative leave and appointed Elayne Hayes-Anthony the acting president.

==Campuses==

The main campus contains over 50 academic and administrative buildings on . It is located at 1400 John R. Lynch Street between Prentiss and Dalton Streets.

Ayer Hall was constructed in 1903 and is the oldest structure on the main campus. It was named in honor of the first president of the institution, Charles Ayer. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Gibbs-Green Pedestrian Walkway was named in honor of the two young men who died in the Jackson State shooting in 1970. As a result of the landmark &quot;Ayers Settlement&quot; in 2002, the university, along with the other two public HBCUs in the state, has completed extensive renovations and upgrades to campus.

Jackson State has satellite campuses throughout the Jackson Metropolitan area:

* Universities Center (Ridgewood Road)

* Downtown (100 Capitol Street)

===Sonic Boom of the South===

The marching band began in the 1940s at what was then Jackson State College, under the directorship of Frederick D. Hall, who had directed a band at the college as early as the 1920s, in addition to the chorus and orchestra. It was initially made up of students from Jackson College and Lanier High School. Founded as the Jackson State University Marching Band, the name &quot;Sonic Boom of the South&quot; was adopted by the school in 1971, after having been suggested by band members. The first full-time band director, William W. Davis, was appointed in 1948, replacing Charles Saulsburg, who had been director since 1947. Davis had previously played trumpet in Cab Calloway&#x27;s band, and Calloway&#x27;s musical style and showmanship influenced Davis&#x27;s conceptualization of the marching band. The band at this time had around 20 members, increasing to 88 in 1963. Davis retired as director in 1971, but remained the chief arranger for the band. He was replaced by Harold J. Haughton. Haughton was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;Prancing J-Settes&quot;, the band&#x27;s accompanying danceline.

<text>Blue Mountain Christian University (BMCU), formerly Blue Mountain College, is a private Baptist college in Blue Mountain, Mississippi. Founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1873, the college&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously for the college to become coeducational in 2005. The university offers baccalaureate degrees as well as graduate programs.

==History==
By 1873, the college was founded as a woman&#x27;s college by Confederate Brigadier-General Mark Perrin Lowrey, a pastor who was known as &quot;a preacher general&quot; during the war. Blue Mountain Female Institute, as it was called at first, started with 50 students with Lowrey and his two daughters serving as the faculty. In 1877, the college was officially chartered by the State of Mississippi. Lowrey, his sons W. T. and B. G., and grandson Lawrence Lowrey all served as the first four presidents. By 1910, the institution was using the name Blue Mountain Female College.

After the sudden death of President Lowrey in 1960, a longtime professor at the school, Wilfred Tyler, became the first non-Lowrey family president followed by E. Harold Fisher in 1965. Bettye Rogers Coward served as the seventh president from 2001 to 2012. Janice I. Nicholson, a BMC alumna, served as transitional president prior to Barbara Childers McMillin&#x27;s becoming the eighth president on August 1, 2012.

Originally an independently owned institution, the college was turned over to the Mississippi Baptist Convention in 1920 by the Lowrey Family. It remained focused on women&#x27;s education until 1956 when a program to train men for church-related vocations was started. In October 2005, the college&#x27;s board of trustees voted to make the school fully coeducational. On November 4, 2022, the college was renamed Blue Mountain Christian University to distinguish the institution from two-year community colleges and to highlight its Christian identity and mission. 

==Athletics==
The Blue Mountain Christian (BMCU) athletic teams are called the Toppers. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) since the 2013–14 academic year. The Toppers previously competed in the TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) from 1996–97 to 2012–13.

Men&#x27;s sports began competition in the 2007–08 academic year, when the school became co-educational.

BMCU competes in 18 intercollegiate sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Club sports include men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s archery, bass fishing and powerlifting.

<doc id="217174" wikidata="Q637860" url="?curid=217174" title="Me Against the World">
<text>Me Against the World is the third studio album by American rapper 2Pac. It was released on March 14, 1995, by Interscope Records and Out da Gutta Records and distributed by Atlantic Records. 2Pac draws lyrical inspiration from his impending prison sentence, troubles with the police, and poverty.

According to 2Pac, &quot;Me Against the World&quot; was made to show the hip-hop audience his respect for the art form. Lyrically, he intentionally tried to make the album more personal and reflective than his previous efforts. Considered by several music critics to be the best of any of his albums up to that point in his career, the album&#x27;s musical production was handled by his mentor Shock G, Easy Mo Bee, Tony Pizarro, Johnny &quot;J&quot; and the Danish hip-hop duo Soulshock and Karlin, among others. &quot;Me Against the World&quot; features guest appearances from rap group Dramacydal and rapper Richie Rich. 

Released while Tupac was imprisoned, &quot;Me Against the World&quot; made an immediate impact on the charts, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, holding the top spot for four consecutive weeks, and also topping the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. &quot;Dear Mama&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single in February 1995 and would be the album&#x27;s most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaking at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. While he was in prison, the album overtook Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as the best-selling album of the year in the United States at the time. 

&quot;Me Against the World&quot; was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 38th Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for Best Rap Album and &quot;Dear Mama&quot; was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance. The album received acclaimed reviews by critics, being ranked among the best albums of the 1990s. It has been ranked by many critics as one of the greatest hip hop albums, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2008, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, included &quot;Me Against the World&quot; in its list of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Background==
By 1994, Tupac Shakur, age 23, was already a prominent and controversial rapper. His second album, &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&quot;, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), entered the top 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and yielded two Gold-certified top 15 singles: &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot;. In rapid succession, however, he had become involved in a string of violent encounters.

From incidents in 1993, Shakur was sentenced to 15 days in jail for assaulting director Allen Hughes while filming &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, pled guilty to the attempted assault on a rival rapper and saw the charges dropped after he shot two off-duty police officers. Later that year, Shakur and two associates were charged with gang-raping a female fan in Shakur&#x27;s hotel room, a charge he vehemently denied. In the ensuing trial, Shakur was acquitted of seven felonies, including rape, sodomy and gun charges, but was convicted of two counts of sexual abuse for unwanted touching and was subsequently sentenced to 18 months to 4.5 years in prison. On November 30, 1994, one day before the jury reached their verdict, Shakur was shot and robbed at gunpoint at the lobby of a New York recording studio. He believed the shooting was set up by East Coast associates and collaborators, such as The Notorious B.I.G., Andre Harrell and Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. 

According to Shakur, &quot;Me Against the World&quot; aimed to show the hip-hop audience his respect for the art form. Shakur purposefully made &quot;Me Against the World&quot;″s lyrics more personal and reflective than previously. This was widely attributed to Shakur&#x27;s growing maturity and perhaps an effort to reconcile with his troubled past.

==Production==
Although originally released by Interscope, the album was later released twice by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur&#x27;s mother, Afeni Shakur. The album was recorded at ten different studios, and it was mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering by Brian Gardner. Several critics found the album&#x27;s musical production the best on any of Tupac&#x27;s albums to date.

Steve &quot;Flash&quot; Juon of RapReviews, assigning the album a perfect 10 of 10, particularly praised &quot;So Many Tears&quot; and &quot;Temptations&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the production a &quot;fatalistic calm, in a commercial mold&quot;, and added that &quot;while 2Pac doesn&#x27;t sing, other voices do, providing smooth melody&quot;. Yet James Bernard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, dissenting, complained that Shakur&#x27;s &quot;vocals are buried deep in the mix. That&#x27;s a shame—if they were more in-your-face, the lackluster beats might be less noticeable.&quot;

==Themes==
Often depicting the travails of male survival in the ghetto, prominent sentiments include anguish, despair, hopelessness, paranoia, and self-loathing. Such dark tracks, sometimes simultaneously menacing, are &quot;If I Die 2Nite&quot;, &quot;Lord Knows&quot;, &quot;Outlaw&quot;, and &quot;Fuck The World&quot;. But there are exceptions. Nostalgic jubilance distinguishes &quot;Old School&quot;—a roster his favorite rap songs, with associated joys, predating his adulthood—while bittersweet optimism occurs in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;. &quot;Can U Get Away&quot; aims to flirtatiously encourage and lure a romantic interest away from her current, abusive relationship. And the track most popular, &quot;Dear Mama&quot;, is a reverent ode to his mother. Throughout the album, Shakur employs various poetical devices, such as alliteration (&quot;If I Die 2Nite&quot;) and paired couplets (&quot;Lord Knows&quot;).

==Singles==
&quot;Dear Mama&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single in February 1995, along with the track &quot;Old School&quot; as the B-side. &quot;Dear Mama&quot; would be the album&#x27;s most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaking at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was certified platinum in July 1995, and later placed at No. 51 on the year-end charts.

It was reported that &quot;Can U Get Away&quot; was intended to be released as the next single with a music video directed by Shakur&#x27;s longtime friend Jada Pinkett. Instead, &quot;So Many Tears&quot; was released as the second single, in June 1995. It reached No. 6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart, and No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Temptations,&quot; released in August, was the third and final single from the album. The single is the least successful of the three released, but still did fairly well on the charts, reaching No. 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 35 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, and No. 13 on the Hot Rap Singles charts.

&quot;Me Against the World&quot;, the title track, was released as a single in Europe. It included the Soul Power Remix and the Soul Power Hip Hop Remix.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Me Against the World&quot; received critical acclaim. In a contemporary review, Cheo H. Coker at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album Shakur&#x27;s best and said it was &quot;by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation — [it] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head-on&quot;. Jon Pareles, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Shakur the &quot;St. Augustine of gangster rap&quot; due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle. In his review for &quot;The Source&quot;, the leading hip-hop magazine in the United States, Allen Gordon hailed Shakur as an elite lyricist on display on the album, called it &quot;his best work by far&quot; and noted that &quot;any complaints critics and fans alike had about Tupac&#x27;s last two albums can be put to rest&quot;. He particularly praised the production and lyricism of the &quot;incredible&quot; title track, &quot;So Many Tears&quot;, &quot;Temptations&quot;, &quot;Heavy in the Game&quot;, &quot;Dear Mama&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot;, but also noted &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, &quot;If I Die 2Nite&quot; and &quot;Young Niggaz&quot; as &quot;notable&quot; tracks.

&quot;This may be the first hip-hop blues LP,&quot; observed Matt Hall in &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;Not so much in the music, although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin&#x27; Wolf than Tupac&#x27;s previous two solo efforts, but more with Shakur&#x27;s vocals, which are at once rebellious and resigned ... &quot;Me Against the World&quot; is a statement of intent, a note from the depths of America, and a fine, thoughtful LP.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, critic Caroline Sullivan observed a &quot;surprisingly optimistic&quot; and thoughtful 2Pac on display on the album, deeming it &quot;worth a listen&quot; despite criticizing the presence of &quot;anodyne&quot; beats and predictable samples.

Jaleel Abdul-Adil of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated that &quot;2Pac&#x27;s latest also mixes toughness and tenderness. Desperation follows raw anger on &quot;Fuck the World&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy,&quot; but most tracks confess frailties beneath the rapper&#x27;s tough exterior. &quot;Dear Mama&quot; is a tear-jerking tribute to his mother, &quot;Lord Knows&quot; discloses desperate considerations of suicide, and &quot;So Many Tears&quot; ponders a merciless world that wrecks young lives. 2Pac even includes a sorrowful &quot;shout-out&quot; to Robert Sandifer, the Chicago youth whose brief life ended in a brutal shooting. After earlier releases that lacked focus and consistency, 2Pac finally presents a polished project of self-examination and social commentary. It&#x27;s ironic that it arrives as his sentence begins.&quot;

Some reviewers were less impressed. James Bernard from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;2Pac does the black-man-backed-into-a-corner routine better than just about anyone because that&#x27;s largely who he is. When he says it&#x27;s &#x27;me against the world,&#x27; there&#x27;s an urgency that only comes from experience. On record, the rapper-turned-movie icon’s vocals are buried deep in the mix. That’s a shame-if they were more in-your-face, the lackluster beats might be less noticeable.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said Shakur witlessly exploited fundamental hip hop themes such as persecution while exhibiting an offensive level of self-pity: &quot;His I-love-Mom rings true because Mom was no saint, and his respect for old G&#x27;s seems genuine, probably because they told him how smart he was. But whether the metaphor be dead homies or suicide threat, the subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Me Against the World&quot; was one of Tupac&#x27;s most acclaimed albums, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career; the work is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip hop albums of all time. In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey dubbed the album &quot;[Shakur&#x27;s] most thematically consistent, least self-contradicting work&quot;, and stated, &quot;it may not be his definitive album, but it just might be his best&quot;. Steve &quot;Flash&quot; Juon of &quot;RapReviews&quot; seemed to feel differently, remarking that the album &quot;is not only the quintessential Shakur album, but one of the most important rap albums released in the 1990s as a whole&quot;. On MTV&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Rappers of All Time&quot; list, &quot;Me Against the World&quot; was listed as one of Tupac&#x27;s &quot;certified classic&quot; albums, along with &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot;, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot;. &quot;One of the best five rap albums ever,&quot; remarked &quot;Mojo&quot;, after Shakur&#x27;s death.

In 1996, at the 38th Grammy Awards, &quot;Me Against the World&quot; was nominated for Best Rap Album and the single &quot;Dear Mama&quot; was nominated for Best Rap Solo Performance. &quot;Me Against the World&quot; won Best Rap Album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2008, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recognized &quot;Me Against the World&quot; as one of the &quot;most influential and popular albums&quot;, ranking it number 170 on a list of 200 other albums by artists of various musical genres. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Me Against the World&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 240,000 copies in the first week. The album held the top spot for four consecutive weeks. The album also debuted at number one on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, thus giving 2Pac the first number one album on both R&amp;B and Pop charts. While Shakur was in prison, the album overtook Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as the best-selling album in the United States, a feat which he took pride in. Shakur became the first artist to have a number one album while serving a prison sentence. On April 26, 1995, the album was certified gold and platinum in the United States. On December 6, 1995, the album was certified double platinum for sales of over two million copies in the United States.
As of September 2011, the album has sold 3,524,567 copies in the United States.

Shakur&#x27;s virtual appearance at the annual Coachella Festival (April 15, 2012) led to the album selling 1,000 copies the following week (up by 53% from the previous week).

<text>The seventh USS &quot;Washington&quot; (ACR-11/CA-11/IX-39), also referred to as &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 11&quot;, and renamed Seattle and reclassified CA-11 and IX-39, was a United States Navy armored cruiser. Commissioned in 1906, renamed in 1916, and not decommissioned until 1946, she spent periods of time in reserve. She was used for escort duties during World War I, and as a receiving ship during World War II.

==Pre-World War I==
The ship was laid down on 23 September 1903 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 18 March 1905, sponsored by Miss Helen Stewart Wilson, daughter of United States Senator John L. Wilson of Washington state, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 7 August 1906, Captain James D. Adams in command.

===1906–1908===
&quot;Washington&quot; was fitted out at Philadelphia until 1 November 1906, when she got underway for Hampton Roads, whence she departed a week later as an escort for which was then carrying President Theodore Roosevelt to Panama for an inspection of progress of work constructing the Panama Canal. During that voyage, the armored cruiser touched at Hampton Roads and Piney Point, Maryland; Colón, Panama; Chiriquí Lagoon; and Mona Passage before she returned to Newport News on 26 November. She headed back toward the Delaware Capes on 8 December, arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on the 11th, and remained there undergoing repairs into the spring of 1907.

&quot;Washington&quot; departed League Island on 11 April and arrived at Hampton Roads the next day. She remained there into May participating in festivities of the Jamestown Exposition which commemorated the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. She returned northward soon thereafter, spending most of May undergoing docking and tests at the New York Navy Yard. She then shook down off Tompkinsville, New York (Staten Island), from 28 May to 5 June before she returned to Hampton Roads for further observances at the Jamestown Exposition.

&quot;Washington&quot; departed Hampton Roads on 11 June and proceeded via Bradford, Rhode Island, to Newport where she joined before heading across the Atlantic on the 14th, bound for European waters. The sister ships visited the French ports of Royan, Île-d&#x27;Aix, La Pallice, and Brest from 23 June to 25 July, before returning to Tompkinsville in August to run speed trials.

Following those trials and a period of yard work at the New York Navy Yard, &quot;Washington&quot; set sail for the Pacific Station, again in company with &quot;Tennessee&quot;. The two armored cruisers subsequently called at Hampton Roads; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; Punta Arenas, Chile; Callao, Peru; Acapulco, Mexico; and Pichilinque Bay, Mexico; before they joined the Pacific Fleet in time to fire target practices with them at Magdalena Bay, Mexico, from late December 1907 to January 1908. &quot;Washington&quot; subsequently operated both in company with the Fleet and on independent tactical exercises out of Magdalena Bay into March, operating also off Santa Barbara, San Francisco, and San Diego, as well as San Pedro, California. Other ports visited by the armored cruiser into the summer of 1908 included Redondo Beach, Venice, Monterey, and Angel Island in California; and Port Townsend, Port Angeles, Seattle, Tacoma, and Bremerton in Washington. She was among the units of the Fleet reviewed by the Secretary of the Navy at San Francisco between 6 and 17 May.

===1909–1911===
&quot;Washington&quot; operated off the west coast into 1909 before she made preparations to sail in company with the Armored Cruiser Squadron to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the Far East. She accordingly got underway from San Francisco on 5 September 1909 and called, in succession, at Honolulu, Hawaii; from 10 to 20 September; and Nares Harbor, Admiralty Islands, where she coaled ship from 17 to 25 October, before she arrived at Manila, Philippine Islands, on 30 October.

After visiting Woosung (near Shanghai), China, from 14 to 30 December 1909, &quot;Washington&quot; and her sisters called at Yokohama, Japan, from 3 to 20 January 1910, and Honolulu from 31 January to 8 February, before returning to the west coast. &quot;Washington&quot; made port back at San Francisco via Port Discovery, Washington and Bremerton on 3 March. She then returned to Bremerton where she commenced a period of repairs on 21 March.

&quot;Washington&quot; next operated off the west coast into the autumn of 1910, holding target practices off Santa Cruz, California, before returning to San Francisco. She coaled ship at Tiburon, California, on 7–8 August before shifting to San Francisco to prepare for her next deployment. On 14 August, she departed San Francisco, bound for South America on the first leg of her voyage to the east coast to join the Atlantic Fleet. With the ships of the 1st Division of the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Washington&quot; visited Valparaíso, Chile, and took part in the observances of the Chilean Centennial Celebration from 10 to 23 September. She then resumed her voyage around South America, touching at Talcahauano and Punta Arenas, Chile; Rio de Janeiro; Carlisle Bay, Barbados; and St. Thomas, Danish West Indies; before she arrived at Culebra, Puerto Rico, on 2 November to prepare for target practice with the Fleet.

&quot;Washington&quot;″s next area of operations was the Tidewater area of Virginia, especially Hampton Roads and Lynnhaven Bay, before the armored cruiser underwent repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 20 December 1910 to 2 January 1911. The armored cruiser subsequently underwent another period of repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard before heading south with stores and material for delivery to the 5th Division of the Fleet in Cuban waters. She arrived at Guantánamo Bay on 20 March and remained there into the summer, conducting trials and exercises with the 5th Division. She then returned northward and stopped at Hampton Roads from 21 to 24 June before pushing on to New York, where she arrived on the 25th.
The armored cruiser operated off the northeastern seaboard through the summer of 1911, holding exercises and maneuvers in areas ranging from Cape Cod Bay to Hampton Roads. During that time, she cruised briefly with the Naval Militia from 19 to 21 July; acted as a reference ship for torpedo practice off Sandwich Island, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on 2 August; witnessed the as that ship fired at the target hulk &quot;San Marcos&quot; (former ) on 27–28 August, and then conducted battle practice with the Fleet off the southern drill grounds. In early November, &quot;Washington&quot; was among the ships of the Fleet reviewed by President William Howard Taft.

The cruiser then participated in a search problem out of Newport, R.I. from 9 to 18 November before she sailed for the West Indies in company with , arriving at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on 26 November. &quot;Washington&quot; subsequently returned home to Hampton Roads in company with her sister ship and went into drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard three days before Christmas of 1911.

===1912–1913===

After returning to the Fleet and participating in maneuvers in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in late January and early February 1912, &quot;Washington&quot; steamed back to the Norfolk Navy Yard where, between 13 and 19 February, she underwent special preparations to embark the Secretary of State and his party. The armored cruiser then shifted to Key West where she embarked the Secretary on 23 February. In the ensuing weeks, &quot;Washington&quot; carried Philander C. Knox and his guests to such ports as Colón, Panama; Port Limón, Costa Rica; Puerto Barrios, Guatemala; La Guaira, Venezuela; Santo Domingo; St. Thomas; Puerto Cabello, Venezuela; San Juan; Port-au-Prince; Guantánamo Bay; Kingston, Jamaica; and Havana, before disembarking her distinguished guests at Piney Point, Maryland, on 16 April.

The high point of the spring of 1912 for &quot;Washington&quot; was her service as temporary flagship for the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, while she was at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 19 April to 3 May. The warship subsequently paused at New York from 9 to 12 May and at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for an inspection by the Board of Inspection and Survey for ships before she conducted maneuvers out of Provincetown and Newport and then received Rear Admiral Hugo Osterhaus, the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, aboard on 26 May. After shifting to Hampton Roads, &quot;Washington&quot; embarked a detachment of additional Marines on 27 May, took on stores; and set out that day for Key West. There, she awaited further orders from 30 May to 10 June, while President Taft concentrated a strong naval force there to prepare for possible action which might be required by internal problems in Cuba.

In the late spring and early summer, a rebellion on that Caribbean island occasioned a show of force by the United States. &quot;Washington&quot; accordingly departed Key West on 10 June and arrived at Havana later that day. She remained there on &quot;duty in connection with the Cuban rebellion&quot; until 1 July, when she shifted to Guantánamo. The rebellion on the island was put down by the Cuban Government, resulting in the withdrawal of the American naval and marine representation there. Accordingly, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed to Hampton Roads, where she discharged her marines and equipment and went into &quot;first reserve&quot; at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 9 July.

&quot;Washington&quot; remained inactive until 8 October, when she sailed for New York to participate in the Naval Review held there from 10 to 15 October and then resumed her reserve status at Portsmouth on 17 October. In early November, crew of the ship played against the 1912 New Hampshire football team in nearby Durham, New Hampshire. Shifted subsequently from Portsmouth to the New York Navy Yard, via President Roads, Boston, and Tompkinsville, Staten Island, &quot;Washington&quot; was assigned duty as receiving ship at the navy yard on 20 July 1913.

===1914===
The armored cruiser was placed in commission again on 23 April 1914, Captain Edward W. Eberle in command. Later that spring, the armored cruiser took aboard drafts of men from Norfolk and Port Royal, South Carolina, on 30 April and 2 May; touched at Key West, and proceeded to Santo Domingo.

Once again there was unrest in the Dominican Republic. A revolution in the northern province of Santiago, against the rule of Provisional President José Bordas Valdez, had been quelled; but one in the province of Puerto Plata, near the capital of Santo Domingo itself, continued unchecked and was marked by severe fighting, fighting so severe that &quot;marked apprehension&quot; existed in &quot;Washington&quot;.

On 1 May, had been ordered to Dominican waters, but a further show of force seemed to be in order. Accordingly, &quot;Washington&quot; was chosen to &quot;show the flag&quot; in those troubled waters. She departed Key West on 4 May and arrived at the beleaguered city of Puerto Plata on 6 May to protect American interests, joining the &quot;Petrel&quot;. Six days later, Captain Eberle invited representatives of both warring parties—the insurgents and the government—out to his ship, in an attempt to persuade both sides to come to an amicable settlement.

Unfortunately, the attempt failed, and the fighting continued. The insurgents were aided by a recent large consignment of guns and ammunition smuggled across the Haitian border that had given them new blood. The revolutionaries soon recaptured the key city of La Vega and were successfully holding Puerto Plata. Government forces, laying siege to that port and shelling the insurgents, clearly endangered the lives of the neutral citizens still living in the city. Captain Eberle objected to the bombardment and warned President Valdés repeatedly.

&quot;Washington&quot; departed Puerto Plata on 6 June with the conflict between the insurgents and the government of President Valdes still unresolved. Her place had been taken by . &quot;Washington&quot; coaled ship and took on stores at Guantánamo Bay from 7 to 10 June before she sailed for Veracruz, Mexico. She then remained in Mexican waters from 14 to 24 June before she shifted to Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, to protect American interests there during an outbreak of violence that summer.

&quot;Washington&quot; remained at Cap-Haïtien into July. In the meantime, the situation in the Dominican Republic had worsened when government shellings of rebel positions in Puerto Plata resulted in an inevitable &quot;incident&quot;. On 26 June, a stray shell killed an English woman in Puerto Plata causing the gunboat &quot;Machias&quot; to shift to a berth in the inner harbor and shell one of President Valdes&#x27; batteries, silencing it with a few well-placed shots. During early July, &quot;Machias&quot; again fired her guns in anger when stray shots hit the ship.

In view of those developments, &quot;Washington&quot; returned to Puerto Plata on 9 July and remained there into the autumn, keeping a vigil to protect American lives and property and standing by to land her landing force if the situation required it. That August, Captain Eberle&#x27;s attempts to bring about a conference finally bore fruit. The United States government sent a commission consisting of John Franklin Fort, the former governor of New Jersey; James M. Sullivan, the American minister to Santo Domingo; and Charles Smith, a New Hampshire lawyer, to mediate a peace in the Dominican Republic.

Both sides ultimately accepted the American suggestions which provided for the establishment of a constitutional government and the institution of elections under United States &quot;observation.&quot;

&quot;Washington&quot; left Santo Domingo on 20 November; but, later that month, continued high feelings over the closely contested election resulted in further unrest—unrest met by the dispatch of additional Marines to Santo Domingo. For &quot;Washington&quot;, however, her part in the Dominican intervention of 1914 was over. She sailed for home and arrived at Philadelphia on 24 November and became flagship of the Cruiser Squadron. She arrived for overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 12 December 1914.

===1915===
Upon completion of her overhaul on 11 January 1915, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed via President Roads, Boston (where she took on ammunition on 11 January), for Hampton Roads, arriving there on 14 January. After a five-day visit, during which she took on stores and provisions and an expeditionary force of Marines, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed for the Caribbean once more.

Two revolutions had rocked Haiti in 1914; a third, in January 1915, led by General Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, had resulted only in further unrest for that troubled nation. &quot;Washington&quot; arrived at Cap-Haïtien on 23 January, a week after General Sam&#x27;s troops had invested it. The armored cruiser, flying the flag of Rear Admiral William B. Caperton and commanded by Captain Edward L. Beach Sr. (father of future naval officer Edward L. Beach Jr., who would win fame as a famous submariner and author) stayed in port there until the 26th investigating &quot;political conditions&quot; before she shifted to the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, on 27 January. There, she again observed local political conditions in the wake of General Sam&#x27;s takeover of the government before sailing, via Guantánamo, for Mexican waters.

&quot;Washington&quot; conducted sub-caliber practices, observed political conditions, and conducted torpedo practices off the ports of Tampico, Tuxpan, Progreso, and Veracruz into the summer. Receiving provisions and stores from the supply ship off Progreso on 26–27 June, the armored cruiser sailed for Guantánamo where she coaled and took on water on 30 June. She sailed the same day for Cap-Haïtien, as all reports from the American minister there indicated that yet another crisis was brewing.

While &quot;Washington&quot; awaited further developments at Cap-Haïtien, events in Port-au-Prince deteriorated, moving American chargé d&#x27;affaires Davis to send a telegram on 27 July to the Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, reporting the troubled conditions. He reported that President Sam and some of his men had been surrounded in the presidential palace and that the presence of American war vessels was desirable.

In accordance with that message, the Navy dispatched &quot;Washington&quot; to that port. Meanwhile, Sam took refuge in the French legation where he hoped that diplomatic immunity would prevail. The mobs of angry Haitians, however, were not concerned with such international niceties; they invaded the legation at 10:30 on 28 July 1915, forcibly removed former President Sam, killed and dismembered him, and paraded portions of his body on poles around the city.

&quot;Washington&quot; arrived at Port-au-Prince that day. Upon reviewing the situation, Admiral Caperton acted quickly. He ordered marines and a landing force ashore from his flagship to protect not only American interests but those of other foreign nations as well. &quot;Washington&quot; remained at Port-au-Prince into the winter. During that time, the United States effectively ran Haiti. On 12 August, Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave was elected president; and his government was recognized by the United States on 17 September.

===1916===
Ending that lengthy in-port period, &quot;Washington&quot; departed Port-au-Prince on 31 January 1916 and arrived at Guantánamo the following day. There, she transferred passengers and stores to other ships of the Fleet and later transferred a company of Marines to Norfolk soon after her arrival in Hampton Roads on 5 February. The armored cruiser steamed north, via New York and Boston; reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 29 February; and began an overhaul in the navy yard there which lasted until the end of March. Then, on 31 March, she was placed in reserve.

The ship was renamed Seattle on 9 November 1916—in order that her original name might be used for the new —but retained her classification as Armored Cruiser No. 11. She was simultaneously taken out of reserve and recommissioned for duty as flagship of the Destroyer Force.

==World War I==
&quot;Seattle&quot;″s peacetime duties as flagship for the Destroyer Force were short. On 6 April 1917, the United States, after attempting to remain neutral despite repeated incidents on the high seas, finally entered World War I.

&quot;Seattle&quot; arrived at New York on 3 June to be fitted out at the New York Navy Yard for war service. She sailed on 14 June as an escort for the first American convoy to European waters and as flagship for Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves. At 22:15 on 22 June, she encountered her first enemy submarines at .

Shortly before the convoy was attacked, &quot;Seattle&quot;″s helm jammed; and she sheered out of formation sharply, sounding her whistle to warn the other vessels. A few minutes later, the ship was brought back on course. Soon lookouts noted a white streak in the water ahead of the vessel, crossing from starboard to port at right angles to &quot;Seattle&quot;″s course. Admiral Gleaves, asleep in the charthouse at the time, awoke and was on the bridge in time to see the armored cruiser&#x27;s gun crews manning their weapons and the transport &quot;De Kalb&quot; opening fire on the U-boat.

Subsequently, the destroyer attacked an enemy submersible but failed to sink the German submarine. Later information indicated that the enemy, probably aware of the approach of the first American expeditionary forces, had dispatched a pair of submarines to lie in wait for it. The attack, conducted under &quot;ideal&quot; conditions, was, fortunately for the Americans, unsuccessful. Admiral Gleaves, in his report to the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, on 12 July, reported unequivocally: &quot;their [the enemy&#x27;s] failure to score hits was probably due to the attack being precipitated by the fortuitous circumstances of the &quot;Seattle&quot;″s helm jamming and the sounding of her whistle, leading the enemy to suppose he had been discovered.&quot;

&quot;Seattle&quot; operated on comparatively uneventful escort duties for the remainder of World War I, completing her ninth round-trip voyage at New York on 27 October 1918.

==Inter-war period==
After the armistice of 11 November 1918, &quot;Seattle&quot;—like many other ships—was fitted with extra accommodations to enable her to function as a transport, and she brought back doughboys from France until 5 July 1919. Later, after all of her special troop fittings had been removed, &quot;Seattle&quot; sailed for the west coast to join the Pacific Fleet.

Reviewed by President Woodrow Wilson on 12 September at her namesake city—Seattle—the armored cruiser shifted to the Puget Sound Navy Yard where she was placed in &quot;reduced commission&quot;. While in that inactive status, &quot;Seattle&quot; was reclassified—CA-11—on 17 July 1920.

Placed in full commission again on 1 March 1923, Captain George L. P. Stone in command, &quot;Seattle&quot; became the flagship for the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. In that role, over the next four years, she wore the four-starred flags of a succession of officers: Admirals Hilary P. Jones, Robert Coontz, Samuel S. Robison (who was embarked in the ship at the time of the Australian cruise of 1925), and Charles F. Hughes. During that time, the armored cruiser operated from Seattle to Hawaii and from Panama to Australia.

Subsequently, returning to the Atlantic in June 1927, &quot;Seattle&quot; passed in review before President Calvin Coolidge on 3 June. After a cruise along the east coast, the ship arrived at New York on 29 August to assume duties as the receiving ship at that port. On 1 July 1931, the ship&#x27;s classification was changed to &quot;unclassified.&quot;

As receiving ship, &quot;Seattle&quot; served as a floating barracks—a &quot;clearance house for personnel&quot;—at New York into the 1940s. Ships and stations transferred men to her for attending various schools in the 3rd Naval District; she provided men for tugs and other district craft, as well as naval escorts for patriotic functions (parades and funerals, etc.) and, on board her, crews for ships preparing to go into commission were assembled. Among those ships was the light cruiser .

==World War II==
On 17 February 1941, the erstwhile armored cruiser was again reclassified, this time as IX-39 and served as receiving ship for the duration of World War II. She was ultimately placed out of commission at New York on 28 June 1946 and was struck from the Navy List on 19 July of the same year. Sold on 3 December to Hugo Neu of New York City, the former flagship of the United States Fleet and receiving ship at New York was subsequently scrapped.

<text>Eve Jihan Cooper (&#x27;Jeffers&quot;&#x27;; born November 10, 1978) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actress. Her debut studio album, &quot;Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders&#x27; First Lady&quot; (1999) peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (making her the third female rapper to do so), received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and spawned the hit singles &quot;What Ya Want&quot; (featuring Nokio), &quot;Love Is Blind&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Man&quot;. That same year, she guest featured on the Roots&#x27; Grammy Award-winning single &quot;You Got Me&quot;, as well as Missy Elliott&#x27;s single &quot;Hot Boyz&quot;, both of which peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Eve&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Scorpion&quot; (2001) was released to similar success. Its lead single, &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; (featuring Gwen Stefani) peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won her the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, as well as an MTV Video Music Award. Her third album, &quot;Eve-Olution&quot; (2002) found continued success and yielded the single &quot;Gangsta Lovin&#x27;&quot; (featuring Alicia Keys), which likewise peaked at number two on the chart. It also spawned the Dr. Dre-produced single &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, which, along with her 2007 single &quot;Tambourine&quot; (featuring Swizz Beatz) and guest performance on City High&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Caramel&quot;, peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She also guest featured on Gwen Stefani&#x27;s Grammy Award-nominated 2004 single &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, which received double platinum certification by the RIAA. After parting ways with Interscope Records, Eve released her fourth studio album, &quot;Lip Lock&quot; (2013) as her first independent project.

As an actress, she starred as Terri Jones in the comedy drama films &quot;Barbershop&quot;, &quot;Barbershop 2: Back in Business&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and played the lead role of Shelley Williams on the UPN television sitcom &quot;Eve&quot;. Eve also had supporting roles in the drama film &quot;The Woodsman&quot; (2004), the comedy film &quot;The Cookout&quot; (2004) and the horror film &quot;Animal&quot; (2014). From 2017 to 2020, she co-hosted the CBS Daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot;, where she was nominated for two Daytime Emmy Awards.

==Early life==
Eve Jihan Jeffers was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Julie Wilch, a publishing company supervisor and Jerry Jeffers, a chemical plant supervisor. Eve lived in West Philadelphia until age 13 when her family moved to the neighborhood of Germantown. She graduated from Martin Luther King High School in Philadelphia.

At the age of 18, she worked as a stripper until rapper Mase convinced her to quit. In 1999, Eve discussed stripping in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying &quot;that was a hustle, too; there&#x27;s a song about it on my album, &#x27;Heaven Only Knows.&#x27; But I don&#x27;t regret it – I was eighteen and confused, going through personal problems. I did it for about a month, and I was glad I did it. It helped me find Eve, helped me get serious. It was depressing – a lot of those girls have three or four kids. I&#x27;d sit there and be like, &#x27;Eve, you don&#x27;t belong here, this is not your world.

Eve&#x27;s first musical interest was singing. She sang in many choirs and even formed an all-female singing group (Dope Girl Posse or EDGP) with a manager. This group covered songs from En Vogue and Color Me Badd. The group&#x27;s manager suggested that they should start rapping, and Eve stuck with it. After the group split up, Eve began working on a solo career under the name &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;.

==Career==
===1998–2001: Beginnings, debut album and breakthrough===
In 1998, Eve appeared on the &quot;Bulworth&quot; soundtrack as Eve of Destruction while signed to Dr. Dre&#x27;s record label Aftermath Entertainment. She appeared on DMX&#x27;s song &quot;Ruff Ryders&#x27; Anthem&quot; (Remix) from his album &quot;It&#x27;s Dark and Hell Is Hot&quot; and The Roots&#x27; single &quot;You Got Me&quot; from the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. Eve also provided background vocals on The Roots&#x27; song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Sayin&#x27; Nothin&#x27; New&quot; from &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; and is credited as Eve of Destruction. Eve&#x27;s first single, &quot;What Y&#x27;all Want&quot;, featuring Nokio the N-Tity of Dru Hill, was released in June 1999. The song peaked at number 29 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and at number one on the Hot Rap Songs chart. &quot;What Ya&#x27;ll Want&quot; was included on the compilation album &quot;Ryde or Die Vol. 1&quot; (1999).

Her debut album called &quot;Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders&#x27; First Lady&quot; was released on September 14, 1999, by Ruff Ryders Entertainment and Interscope Records. It sold 213,000 copies in the first week. The album has sold over 2 million copies (according to SoundScan) and is certified Double Platinum. The album features singles such as &quot;Gotta Man&quot; and &quot;Love Is Blind&quot;. &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; was written when she was 16 and based on her 17-year-old best friend&#x27;s relationship with a 35-year-old abusive man by whom she became pregnant. All of the songs on the album were written by Eve herself.

Eve became the third female hip-hop artist to have her album peak at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Lauryn Hill&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, being the first to top the chart in 1998 and Foxy Brown&#x27;s second album, &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; achieving the feat earlier in 1999. In November 1999, Eve was featured on Missy Elliott&#x27;s single &quot;Hot Boyz (Remix)&quot; along with Nas, Lil Mo, and Q-Tip. The remix broke the record for most weeks at number-one on the US R&amp;B chart on the issue dated January 15, 2000; as well as spending 18 weeks at number one on the Hot Rap Singles from December 4, 1999, to March 25, 2000.

Eve does not like being referred to as a &quot;Pop Princess&quot;. Her second studio album &quot;Scorpion&quot;, was released on March 6, 2001. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, which referred to her as the &quot;Queen of Rap&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number six in the United Kingdom. It was also number 97 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The second single, &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the US Mainstream Top 40 chart. It won a Grammy Award in 2002 for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, which was a brand new category at the time. The song was listed at number seven on the 2001 Pazz &amp; Jop list, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau. A remix of &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; featuring singer Faith Evans also appeared on the album. In 2001, Eve won the BET Award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist. In November 2001, she appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and won $32,000 for her charity.

Eve&#x27;s third album, &quot;Eve-Olution&quot;, was released by Ruff Ryders Entertainment on August 27, 2002, and peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Gangsta Lovin&#x27;&quot;, with Alicia Keys, became her second consecutive number-two hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as her third consecutive top ten hit in the United Kingdom.

In 2003, Eve starred as a fashion designer called Shelly Williams in the television sitcom, &quot;Eve&quot;. The show followed two sets of male and female friends attempting to navigate relationships with the opposite sex. The show aired for three seasons on UPN from September 15, 2003, to May 11, 2006.

In July 2007, Eve made a guest appearance on Maroon 5&#x27;s second single &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; on Live &quot;45th at Night&quot;. In late 2008, she performed &quot;Set It On Fire&quot;, which became available on the &quot;Transporter 3 soundtrack&quot;. In April 2009, Eve and Lil Jon appeared on the song &quot;Patron Tequila&quot;, the debut single of girl group Paradiso Girls.

She played Ophelia Franklin in the British drama film &quot;Flashbacks of a Fool&quot; (2008). In 2009, she landed a role as Rosa Sparks in the comedy-drama film &quot;Whip It&quot;, opposite Elliot Page and Drew Barrymore. It received generally positive reviews from critics but did not perform well financially, having made $16.6 million worldwide against its $15 million budget. Also in 2009, she portrayed La-La Buendia in an episode of CBS&#x27; crime drama series &quot;Numbers&quot; and appeared in two episodes of Fox&#x27;s musical comedy-drama series &quot;Glee&quot;, appearing as Grace Hitchens.

In November 2010, Eve performed a rap on Australian singer Guy Sebastian&#x27;s single &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, which reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and has been certified 4× Platinum.

In April 2012, Eve appeared on reggae artist Shaggy&#x27;s single &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot;.

===2013–2015: &quot;Lip Lock&quot; and label change===

In 2007, Eve began working on a new album titled &quot;Here I Am&quot;. Five of the album&#x27;s songs were produced by Swizz Beatz, including the singles &quot;Tambourine&quot; and &quot;Give It to You&quot; (featuring Sean Paul). &quot;Tambourine&quot; debuted at number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the week of April 19, 2007. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 38, two weeks before the song&#x27;s physical release. &quot;Tambourine&quot; peaked at number 18 there and was her fifth consecutive top twenty solo hit in the UK. The song peaked at number 68 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007, and was placed at number 70 on MTV Asia&#x27;s list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. Pharrell Williams produced the song &quot;All Night Long&quot;, in which Eve sings rather than raps. The album ran into a series of delays due to corporate change at the record label and discontent with the lackluster success of the singles.

The album was renamed twice from &quot;Here I Am&quot; to &quot;Flirt&quot; to &quot;Lip Lock&quot;. After Eve left Interscope Records and signed with EMI, &quot;Lip Lock&quot; was expected to be released in 2011, but it was delayed again. In 2012, Eve decided to release the album as an independent artist, and stated that there will be several buzz singles before the official single release. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Eve stated that &quot;one of the biggest things that I wanted to do on this album was make people realize why they fell in love with me in the first place and then take them on a journey to where I am now musically. My ear is different but I think people will recognize me. I think you&#x27;ll hear that I&#x27;m in a happy place. I miss my music. My hunger is different than the first time around&quot;. On October 9, 2012, Eve released a promotional single titled &quot;She Bad Bad&quot; on iTunes. In November 2012, Eve released a series of weekly remixes on YouTube called &quot;EVEstlin&#x27; Tuesdays&quot;, in which she added freestyle rap verses on 2012 hit singles, such as Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds&quot; and Miguel&#x27;s &quot;Adorn&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Make It Out This Town&quot;, featuring Gabe Saporta of Cobra Starship was released on February 23, 2013. In an interview with &quot;Rap-Up TV&quot;, Eve confirmed that the second official single would be &quot;Eve&quot; featuring Jamaican reggae artist Miss Kitty. The music video for the song was shot in London in February 2013 and premiered on BET on April 29, 2013. On May 14, 2013, &quot;Lip Lock&quot; was released under her own label From The Rib Music and distributed through Sony/RED. The album debuted at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album features collaborations with Juicy J, Dawn Richards, Claude Kelly, Pusha T, Chrisette Michele, Nacho, Gabe Saporta, Propaine, Missy Elliott, and Snoop Dogg. She appeared in the post-apocalyptic action comedy &quot;Bounty Killer&quot; (2013) and the horror thriller film &quot;Animal&quot; (2014). In 2014, Eve appeared in two episodes of the Oxygen reality television series &quot;Sisterhood of Hip Hop&quot;. She portrayed Amaya in Lifetime&#x27;s romantic comedy television film &quot;With This Ring&quot; (2015) alongside Jill Scott and Regina Hall.

This was followed on October 18, 2021, by another rap song from the &quot;Queens &quot; soundtrack: &quot;The Introduction&quot;, which was co-written by Nas. &quot;Queens&quot; debuted on October 19, 2021, and reviews were largely positive; Caroline Framke for Variety praised the quartet&#x27;s musical offering, calling their raps &quot;sharp and distinct […] making clear their talent as both individuals and a swaggering collective&quot;. Angie Han for The Hollywood Reporter called the show &quot;Impressive […] lavish […] magic&quot;. The show was cancelled in early 2022 after one season.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gambanteinn (Old Norse &quot;gambanteinn&quot; &#x27;magic wand&#x27;) appears in two poems in the Poetic Edda. It only appears in &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot; and &quot;Skírnismál&quot;.

==&quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;==
In &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot; stanza 20, Hárbarðr says:

A giant hard       was Hlébard, methinks:&lt;br&gt;
His &quot;gambanteinn&quot; he gave me as gift,&lt;br&gt;
And I stole his wits away.
==&quot;Skírnismál&quot;==
In &quot;Skírnismál&quot; (Stanzas 25 to 26) Skírnir speaks to Gerd:
Seest thou, maiden,       this keen, bright sword&lt;br&gt;
That I hold here in my hand?&lt;br&gt;
Before its blade the       old giant bends,—&lt;br&gt;
Thy father is doomed to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I strike thee, maid,       with my &quot;gambanteinn&quot;,&lt;br&gt;
To tame thee to work my will;&lt;br&gt;
There shalt thou go       where never again&lt;br&gt;
The sons of men shall see thee.

Skírnir then condemns Gerd to live lonely and hideous, unloved, either married to a three-headed giant or forever unwed. It might seem that this &quot;gambanteinn&quot; also refers to the sword with which Skirnir has previously threatened Gerd. But immediately after concluding his curse, Skírnir says (stanza 32):

I go to the wood,       and to the wet forest,&lt;br&gt;
To win a &quot;gambanteinn&quot;;&lt;br&gt;
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  &lt;br&gt;
I won a &quot;gambanteinn&quot;.

The poem then continues with further threats by Skírnir condemning Gerd to a life of misery.

<doc id="217189" wikidata="Q2735576" url="?curid=217189" title="Collateral estoppel">
<text>Collateral estoppel (CE), known in modern terminology as issue preclusion, is a common law estoppel doctrine that prevents a person from relitigating an issue. One summary is that, &quot;once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision ... preclude[s] relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case&quot;. The rationale behind issue preclusion is the prevention of legal harassment and the prevention of overuse or abuse of judicial resources.

== Issue ==

Parties may be estopped from litigating determinations on issues made in prior actions. The determination may be an issue of fact or an issue of law. Preclusion requires that the issue decided was decided as part of a valid final judgment. In the United States, valid final judgments of state courts are given preclusive effect in other state and federal courts under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Valid final judgments must be issued by courts with appropriate personal and subject matter jurisdiction. It is notable, however, that an error does not make a decision invalid. Reversible errors must be appealed. The legal defense (CE) applies even if an erroneous judgment, or erroneous use of legal principles, occurred in the first action. An incorrect conclusion of the court in the first suit does not cause defendant to forsake the protection of &quot;res judicata&quot; (and by extension, of CE). A judgment need not be correct to preclude further litigation; it is sufficient that it be final, and that it have been decided on the merits of the case.

Collateral estoppel does not prevent an appeal of a decision, or a party from asking the judge for re-argument or a revised decision. In federal court, judgments on appeal are given preclusive effect. However, if the decision is vacated, the preclusive effect of the judgment fails.

== Due process concerns ==

Collateral estoppel cases raise constitutional due process problems, particularly when it is applied to a party that did not participate in the original suit. Due process mandates that collateral estoppel not be applied to a party that has not litigated the issue in dispute, unless that party is in legal privity to a party that litigated it. In other words, every disputant is entitled to a day in court and cannot ordinarily be bound by the negative result of another disputant&#x27;s suit, even if that other disputant had exactly the same legal and factual arguments.

Due process concerns also can arise even when a party did have a day in court to dispute an issue. For example, a defendant may have not effectively litigated an issue decided against the defendant in an earlier suit because the damages were too small, so it may be unjust to bar the defendant from relitigating the issue in a trial for much greater damages. As another example, suppose that a defendant did effectively litigate an issue to a favorable conclusion in nine cases, but to an unfavorable result in a tenth case. In this situation, note that the defendant did not have the opportunity to use the nine judgments in its favor as collateral estoppel against subsequent plaintiffs, because that would violate their right to a day in court. As suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court in Parklane Hosiery Co, Inc. v. Shore, to allow a subsequent plaintiff to use the tenth, negative judgment as collateral estoppel against the defendant may seem unjust.

== Mutuality ==

Historically, collateral estoppel applied only where there was mutuality of parties, meaning that both the party seeking to employ collateral estoppel and the party against whom collateral estoppel is sought were parties to the prior action.

Most courts in the United States have now abandoned mutuality as a requirement for collateral estoppel in most circumstances. The California Supreme Court case of &quot;Bernhard v. Bank of America&quot;, authored by justice Roger J. Traynor, began a movement away from the application of mutuality in collateral estoppel. Bernhard claimed that certain assets held by the executor Cook of a decedent&#x27;s estate were part of that estate, while the executor claimed they had been gifted to him by the decedent. In a previous court action it was decided that the assets were gifts to the executor and not assets in escrow, upon which Bernhard sued the bank that had been holding the assets and that had disbursed them to the executor, alleging again that the assets were property of the estate and should have been handled as estate matter. The bank successfully used CE as defense, arguing that Bernhard had already adjudicated the right to those funds and had lost. The court concluded that it was proper for a new party to take advantage of findings in a previous suit to bar action by a party of that suit. Since Bernhard had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in her first suit, the court did not allow her to retry the same issue by merely switching defendants. The precedent of &quot;Bernhard&quot; holds that collateral estoppel may be used as defense against any party who has fully and fairly litigated an issue in a previous action.

In the absence of mutuality, courts are more hesitant to apply collateral estoppel in an offensive setting than in a defensive one. In other words, courts are more hesitant to apply collateral estoppel to a defendant from a previous action if the defendant is sued by a new plaintiff for the same issue.

== Strategy ==

Collateral estoppel may be used either defensively or offensively; mutually or non-mutually:

* Defensive mutual collateral estoppel
** Used against the plaintiff from the first suit regarding issue(s) that were previously litigated against the defendant from the first suit
* Defensive non-mutual collateral estoppel
** Used by a new defendant in a subsequent suit who wants to assert a final judgment on an issue(s) against the plaintiff from the first suit
* Offensive mutual collateral estoppel
** Used against the defendant from the first suit by the plaintiff (from the first suit) in a subsequent suit thereby preventing relitigation on an issue already decided
* Offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel
** Used by a new plaintiff in a subsequent suit who wants to assert a final judgment on an issue(s) against the defendant from the first suit
** U.S. Courts employ &quot;Fairness Factors&quot; from &quot;Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore&quot;, to determine validity of the offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel:
**# Could the party trying to assert collateral estoppel have intervened in the earlier suit?
**# Did defendant have incentive to litigate the first action?
**# Are there multiple, prior inconsistent judgments?
**# Are there any procedural opportunities available to defendant in the second suit that were not available in the first suit?

Collateral estoppel may be avoided as a defense if the claimant did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue decided by a state court, which means he may file suit in federal court to challenge the adequacy of state procedures. Note that in this case the plaintiff&#x27;s suit would be against the state, not against the other party from the prior lawsuit.

In the U.S., the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel does not extend to the U.S. government; it is limited to private litigants.

==Rationale==
Collateral estoppel is an efficiency rule that is meant to save judicial resources by avoiding the relitigation of issues of fact that have already been litigated. The rule is also intended to protect defendants from the inequity of having to defend the same issue repeatedly.

But note that the use of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel may work against the goal of judicial economy. The offensive use encourages potential plaintiffs to sit and &quot;test the waters&quot; to see the strength of the defendant&#x27;s case. If the defendant&#x27;s case is weak, there is great incentive for new parties to sue and claim that the defendant is estopped based on the prior adverse ruling.

== Related concepts ==
Collateral estoppel is closely related to the concept of claim preclusion, which prevents parties relitigating the same cause of action after it has been decided by a judge or jury. &quot;Res judicata&quot; (literally - that which has been decided) can be used as the term for both concepts, or purely as a synonym for claim preclusion. Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, the second action is upon a different cause of action and the judgment in the prior suit precludes relitigation of issues litigated and necessary to the outcome of the first action.

&quot;Res judicata&quot; may be used as a defense in a second suit which involves the same claim as a prior suit, and is conclusive on all matters which were litigated as well as all matters which could have been litigated in the prior suit. In &quot;collateral estoppel&quot; the judgment is conclusive only regarding the issues which were litigated. In order for CE to apply, four factors must be met:
*The issues in the second suit are the same as in the first suit
*The issues in the first suit must have been litigated
*The issues in the first suit must have been decided
*The issues must have been necessary to the court&#x27;s judgment

See also direct estoppel.

== Criminal law ==
Although issue preclusion emerged from civil law, in the United States it has applied to federal criminal law since &quot;United States v. Oppenheimer&quot; in 1916. In 1970 in &quot;Ashe v. Swenson&quot;, the United States Supreme Court applied it to double jeopardy to limit prosecution for crimes committed at the same time.

<doc id="217192" wikidata="Q7447776" url="?curid=217192" title="Selective prosecution">
<text>In jurisprudence, selective prosecution is a procedural defense in which defendants argue that they should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law because the criminal justice system discriminated against them by choosing to prosecute. In claims of selective prosecution, defendants essentially argue that it is irrelevant whether they are guilty of violating a law, but that the fact of being prosecuted is based upon forbidden reasons. Such a claim might, for example, entail an argument that persons of different age, race, religion, sex, gender, or political alignment, were engaged in the same illegal acts for which the defendant is being tried yet were not prosecuted, and that the defendant is being prosecuted &quot;specifically&quot; because of a bias as to that class. 

==In the United States==
In the United States, this defense is based upon the 14th Amendment, which stipulates, &quot;nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court has defined the term as: &quot;A selective prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.&quot; The defense is rarely successful; some authorities claim, for example, that there are no reported cases in at least the past century in which a court dismissed a criminal prosecution because the defendant had been targeted based on race. In &quot;United States v. Armstrong&quot; (1996), the Supreme Court ruled the Attorney General and United States Attorneys &quot;retain &#x27;broad discretion&#x27; to enforce the Nation&#x27;s criminal laws&quot; and that &quot;in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.&quot; Therefore, the defendant must present &quot;clear evidence to the contrary&quot;, which demonstrates &quot;the federal prosecutorial policy &#x27;had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.&#x27;&quot;

Selective prosecution has been raised as a possible defense in the election obstruction case of Donald Trump, and as a possible motivation for tax and firearms charges against Hunter Biden.

<doc id="217196" wikidata="Q1319610" url="?curid=217196" title="Lifetime (TV channel)">
<text>Lifetime (colloquially known as &quot;My Lifetime&quot;) is an American basic cable channel that is part of Lifetime Entertainment Services, a subsidiary of A&amp;E Networks, which is jointly owned by Hearst Communications and The Walt Disney Company. It features programming that is geared toward women or features women in lead roles.
, Lifetime is available to approximately 63,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households.

As of November 2023, Lifetime has garnered nominations for 63 Emmy Awards, 8 Golden Globe Awards and 20 Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards.

==History==
===Predecessors===
There were two television channels that preceded Lifetime in its current incarnation. Daytime, originally called BETA, was launched in March 1982 by Hearst-ABC Video Services. The cable service operated four hours per day on weekdays. The service was focused on alternative women&#x27;s programming. The following year, the Cable Health Network was launched as a full-time channel in June 1982 with a range of health-related programming.

===Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services===
Lifetime was established on February 1, 1984, as the result of a merger of Hearst/ABC&#x27;s Daytime and Viacom&#x27;s Cable Health Network. A board for the new network was formed with equal representation from Hearst, ABC, and Viacom, and the board elected Thomas Burchill as the new network&#x27;s first CEO. It was not an initial success, reportedly losing $36 million in its first two years of operation, and did not become profitable until 1986. The channel suffered from low viewership, with a poll reportedly finding that some TV viewers erroneously believed it carried religious content.

In 1985, Lifetime started branding itself as &quot;Talk Television&quot;, with a nightly lineup of talk shows and call-in programs hosted by people including Regis Philbin and Ruth Westheimer (known as &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;). In the process, the creators dropped the apple from the logo.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Lifetime devoted itself on Sundays to the airing of in-depth medical programs—and advertising—for physicians under the banner of Lifetime Medical Television (LMT). As early as 1990, however, plans were floated to move LMT to another channel, with TLC and CNBC being considered. Lifetime began programming Sundays on August 1, 1993.

In 1988, Lifetime hired Patricia Fili as its head of programming. In the first three years of her tenure, she changed 60 percent of Lifetime&#x27;s programming, by her own estimate. In addition to overhauling Lifetime&#x27;s signature talk show, &quot;Attitudes&quot;, by hiring a new producer and refocusing it on current women&#x27;s issues, Fili acquired the rights to syndicated network hits like &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. She also oversaw the production of the first Lifetime movies ever made, along with carrying the final three seasons of the Blair Brown–starring dramedy &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot; from NBC after the network canceled it. The network also showed movies from the portfolios of its owners, Hearst, ABC, and Viacom. In 1991, reporter Joshua Hammer stated, &quot;Considered one of cable TV&#x27;s backwaters, [...] Lifetime network was replete with annoying gabfests for housewives and recycled, long-forgotten network television series, such as &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; and &quot;MacGruder and Loud&quot;. [...] Under Fili&#x27;s direction, Lifetime has gone a long way toward shedding its low-rent image.&quot;

Douglas McCormick became the network&#x27;s president in 1993. He moved to make Lifetime a seven-day-a-week network by ending Lifetime Medical Television after nearly a decade of existence, and the next year, the channel relaunched with a new tagline, &quot;Television for Women&quot;. Lifetime began airing a limited amount of women&#x27;s sports coverage, including the WNBA and the America&#x27;s Cup, in which it sponsored the first women&#x27;s crew team to compete. McCormick also strengthened the network&#x27;s ties with women&#x27;s organizations, such as the National Organization for Women, and began airing public service announcements about women&#x27;s issues, such as breast cancer awareness.

Meanwhile, the channel&#x27;s original programming was aimed not just at women aged 24–44, but these women&#x27;s spouses, who research showed watched the network in the evenings with their wives. This was done by making the male characters in Lifetime&#x27;s original programming – such as the film series &quot;Spencer for Hire&quot; – more appealing to men by making them more masculine. These roles were more stereotypical than previous Lifetime movies, which usually featured women protagonists on their own. This helped Lifetime take advantage of a known bias in the Nielsen ranking system that favored &quot;upscale&quot; couples who shared a television set. By January 1995, Lifetime was the sixth most-highly rated subscription network by Nielsen.

===Lifetime Entertainment Services===
In 1996, TCI, one of the United States&#x27; largest subscription providers, announced that it would no longer carry Lifetime in certain markets to make room for the soon-to-be-launched Fox News Channel, in which TCI held a financial stake. According to Lifetime executives, the network stood to lose up to one million subscribers due to TCI&#x27;s move. However, Lifetime published advertisements in some of the markets that would be affected – including Eugene, Oregon and Newport, Rhode Island – informing customers that TCI was removing the only network that was made for women. After TCI customers called the company to complain, TCI cut back the number of homes that would lose Lifetime to approximately 300,000. Still, women&#x27;s groups and politicians rallied behind Lifetime. Colorado representative Patricia Schroeder called TCI&#x27;s decision a &quot;power play&quot; between TCI chief executive John Malone and Fox executive Rupert Murdoch, and said, &quot;Women kind of feel like they&#x27;re being rolled over so that the guys who run these companies can make more money.&quot;

Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank said that the decision showed that Fox &quot;might have an agenda of its own that is anti-woman.&quot; TCI executives were surprised and angry about the public&#x27;s reaction. TCI&#x27;s vice president of programming was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying, &quot;I resent the implication that they are the women&#x27;s network. Other networks come in to us and say Lifetime is not telling the truth. Lifetime is a women&#x27;s channel only in name and advertising. [...] It programs for ratings.&quot; TCI senior vice president Robert Thomson stated that the reaction was &quot;laughably out of scale,&quot; based on the fact that less than 10 percent of Lifetime&#x27;s audience would be affected. TCI executives chalked the politicians&#x27; reactions up to lobbying by Lifetime (it being an election year), and suggested to the &quot;Times&quot; that in retaliation, Disney, one of Lifetime&#x27;s parent companies, might have trouble launching a new network on TCI. In 1997, it was reported that Lifetime had 67.7 million subscribers.

===A&amp;E ownership===
On August 27, 2009, Lifetime was acquired by A&amp;E Networks; the company was already owned by Lifetime&#x27;s shareholders Hearst and Disney, but with additional shares owned by NBC Universal. NBCUniversal divested its stake in A&amp;E Networks in 2012, once again leaving the network as a Disney/Hearst joint venture.

==Programming==

Lifetime&#x27;s original content is currently composed of made-for-TV films and reality series, such as &quot;Dance Moms&quot;. The network states that it &quot;is committed to offering the highest quality entertainment and information programming, and advocating a wide range of issues affecting women and their families.&quot;

In the past, Lifetime used to air several game shows in daytime and early evenings, including &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, &quot;Shop &#x27;til You Drop&quot;, &quot;Rodeo Drive&quot;, &quot;Born Lucky&quot;, and &quot;Debt&quot;. Lifetime also produced one original game show (&quot;Who Knows You Best?&quot;, starring Gina St. John), with a format based on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;; it was canceled after one season. The network has also previously produced scripted dramas, such as &quot;Devious Maids&quot; and &quot;Witches of East End&quot;.

The network currently airs a mix of second-run syndicated series (such as &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;) during the daytime hours. In the past, Lifetime has revived several programs that originally aired on other networks. In 1988, it bought the rights to the existing 26 episodes of &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot; from its original broadcaster NBC, and produced 39 additional episodes of the series. Lifetime did not renew the show reportedly because of low ratings and the high cost to produce the program. In late 2011, the network began to air new episodes of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, a program canceled in series form by Fox at the end of the 2010–11 season, although special feature episodes continued to air intermittently on Fox. Lifetime aired more than 40 new episodes of the program before cancelling it in 2013.

On July 21, 2017, Lifetime simulcasted the premiere of Disney Channel&#x27;s original movie &quot;Descendants 2&quot;; marking the first time the channel premiered a program produced for a wholly-owned Disney subsidiary.

In 2018, Lifetime premiered &quot;Harry &amp; Meghan: A Royal Romance&quot;, a story about the relationship between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It also premiered the James Corden-produced &quot;Seatbelt Psychic&quot; with Thomas John&quot;.&quot;

===Films===

In addition to feature films, as well as made-for-television films previously broadcast on other networks, Lifetime is known for producing various original films of its own. These films are produced by the network&#x27;s own Lifetime Pictures unit. A movie-focused spin-off channel, known informally as the Lifetime Movie Network or &quot;LMN&quot; due to its frequent rebrands, was launched in 1998.

===Sports===
In its early years, Lifetime occasionally broadcast coverage of women&#x27;s professional sports. From its inaugural season in 1997 to 2000, Lifetime was one of three broadcasters of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), alongside NBC and ESPN. In 2000, Lifetime phased out its live broadcasts and replaced them with an original series documenting the lives of WNBA players. The network stated that it wanted to focus on &quot;stories&quot; rather than event coverage; the program package would move to ESPN2. As part of an arrangement with Raycom Sports, the network also broadcast the LPGA&#x27;s Tournament of Champions in 1998.

In February 2017, A&amp;E Networks acquired an equity stake in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, and announced that Lifetime would broadcast a weekly, Saturday-afternoon game beginning in the 2017 season.

===High Definition===
Lifetime launched an HD simulcast on April 16, 2008.

==International versions==
===Canada===

On May 30, 2012, Canadian television broadcaster Shaw Media announced that it would rebrand Showcase Diva, a Category B subscription specialty channel as the Canadian version of Lifetime under a licensing agreement with A+E Networks; Showcase Diva relaunched as Lifetime on August 27, 2012.

===Southeast Asia===

AETN All Asia Networks plans to bring the Lifetime channel into Southeast Asia. The channel began broadcasting on June 14, 2013, 6.00 p.m with Astro and StarHub TV being two of the first providers to carry Lifetime in Asia. In July, available in Hong Kong now TV channel 520. And since September 1, 2014, Lifetime Asia airs in the Philippines on Dream Satellite TV channel 18 and SkyCable.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

A+E Networks UK launched a version of Lifetime for the UK and Ireland in November 2013. The network was unsuccessful in the market, as Lifetime&#x27;s program contractors instead distributed their programming on different networks, and it slowly lost rights over the years. The channel closed at 06:00 on March 1, 2021, after A+E Networks UK contracted with Discovery+ to carry Lifetime&#x27;s original network-produced American programming in the UK and Ireland.

===Latin America===

Lifetime announced the launch of a Latin American version of the network, which launched on July 1, 2014, in association with Sony Pictures Television Latin America. It supplanted the now-defunct Sony Spin channel (formerly known as Locomotion from 1996 to 2005 and Animax from 2005 to 2011) on the Amazonas satellite serving South America. Lifetime Latin America is currently distributed by Ole Distribution, currently based in Bogotá, Colombia, under license from A+E Networks Latin America and Sony Pictures Television Latin America. In Brazil, its programming is fully dubbed in Portuguese.

In Mexico, it was launched on October 1, 2014, replacing The Biography Channel.

===Africa===
A+E Networks launched the African version of Lifetime on Channel 131 on DStv on July 22, 2014. On April 25, 2022, it was announced the channel alongside Lifetime Play would cease transmission in Africa by the end of May.

===Israel===
A+E Networks launched a version of Lifetime for Israel on September 14, 2014, replacing The Biography Channel.

===Turkey===
On March 16, 2016, A&amp;E Television Networks announced that Lifetime (Turkey) channel would be launched on April 26, 2016, in Turkey with the cooperation of Multi Channel Developers. Lifetime Turkey ceased operations on April 26, 2019.

===South Korea===
A localized version of Lifetime was launched on September 22, 2017, by A+E Networks Asia-Pacific and local company iHQ. Its programming primarily consists of Korean dramas, talk shows, and entertainment programs. &quot;Backstreet Rookie&quot; is the first Korean drama invested in by the channel.

===MENA===
In 2019, A&amp;E Television Networks was scheduled to launch a version of Lifetime for the Middle East &amp; Northern Africa region.

===Australia===
A&amp;E Television Networks launched a version of Lifetime Movie Network for Australia on September 1, 2020, as a joint venture with the Foxtel network.

==LRW==
LRW, or Lifetime Real Women, is an American pay television channel which is intended as a complementary service to the main Lifetime network. It was launched in August 2001, mainly as a response to Lifetime&#x27;s challenges from the then-launching WE tv and Oxygen networks for the women&#x27;s network market. LRW is available in over 10 million homes via some cable providers, Verizon FiOS, and AT&amp;T U-verse. The network has a mixture of comedies, dramas, how-to, game shows and reality programming that had once aired or is currently airing on the main Lifetime network, and formerly imported series with rights held by Lifetime but no carriage due to the main network&#x27;s current format. LRW also features no original series or films, deferring from Lifetime and LMN, though it did burn off the 2011 Lifetime reality series &quot;Love Handles: Couples in Crisis&quot;, which only aired twice on the main network.

DirecTV carried the network until July 2007. Orby TV also carried the network for the last year of that service&#x27;s existence.

Overall carriage has declined as providers choose instead to carry high definition networks rather than standard definition-only channels such as LRW without original programming, and Lifetime itself promoting on-demand access to past series, along with broadcast venues such as Start TV, the defunct Twist and TrueReal subchannel networks, and ad-supported streaming FAST channels.

==Lifetime Movie Club==
On July 2, 2015, Lifetime launched a streaming service branded as Lifetime Movie Club. The service offers over 2,000 titles, both originally-produced and acquired by Lifetime.

<text>James Lusk Alcorn (November 4, 1816December 19, 1894) was a governor, and U.S. senator during the Reconstruction era in Mississippi. A Moderate Republican and Whiggish &quot;scalawag&quot;, he engaged in a bitter rivalry with Radical Republican Adelbert Ames, who defeated him in the 1873 gubernatorial race. Alcorn was the first elected Republican governor of Mississippi.

Although a Unionist, Alcorn briefly served as a Confederate brigadier-general of the Mississippi Militia. Among former Confederates who joined the postbellum Republican Party, only James Longstreet had been of higher rank than Alcorn.

==Early life and career==
Alcorn was born near Golconda, Illinois Territory to James Alcorn and Hanna Lusk, a Scots-Irish family. He attended Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, and from 1839 to 1844 served as deputy sheriff of Livingston County, Kentucky. He was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1838 and for six years practicing law in Salem, Kentucky. He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1843 before moving to Mississippi the following year.

Alcorn set up a law office in Coahoma County, Mississippi. As his law practice flourished and his property holdings in the Mississippi Delta increased, he became a wealthy man. In 1850, he built a three-story house at his Mound Place Plantation in Coahoma County, where he resided with his family. By 1860, he enslaved nearly one hundred people and held lands valued at a quarter of a million dollars. Alcorn served in the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi Senate during the 1840s and 1850s being one of the leaders of the then Whigs in the state.

He founded the levee system and was chosen president of the levee board. In the Mississippi legislature, Alcorn pushed for the construction of levees to protect Delta counties from flooding. A levee district was established in 1858 through his efforts. He ran for Congress in 1856 but was defeated. In 1857, Alcorn was nominated for governor by the Whigs but declined.

Alcorn was a delegate to the special Mississippi convention of 1851 called by Democratic governor John A. Quitman, who, as an opponent of Henry Clay&#x27;s Compromise of 1850 advocated secession. Alcorn joined the Mississippi Unionists to thwart Quitman&#x27;s plans. Like many other Whig planters, Alcorn opposed secession, pleading with the secessionists to reflect on the realities of the national balance of power. He foretold a horrific picture of a beaten Southern United States, &quot;when the northern soldier would tread her cotton fields, when the slave should be made free and the proud Southerner stricken to the dust in his presence.&quot; However, in January 1861, at the Mississippi state convention, he joined the secessionists and was elected to the &quot;Committee of Fifteen&quot; to prepare the Ordinance of Secession.

==American Civil War==
When secession was declared, Alcorn, although born in what became in 1818 the free, pro-U.S. state of Illinois, joined the Confederate States of America and was appointed by the Mississippi secession convention as a militia brigadier-general. However, when his brigade entered the Confederate States Army, Jefferson Davis refused to commission him on account of political differences. Alcorn, during the war, was in uniform for about eighteen months of inconspicuous field service, mainly in raising troops and in garrison duty. After the resignation of several major generals of the Mississippi State Troops, including Davis, Earl Van Dorn, and Charles Clark, Alcorn became eligible for promotion in rank but was passed over because his political foe, John J. Pettus, was the governor of Mississippi at the time.

At the start of the Civil War, Alcorn was ordered to proceed with his troops to central Kentucky; then, he was stationed at Fort Donelson, Tennessee. In October 1861, Alcorn raised three regiments of militia troops, designated as the Army of 10,000, committed to sixty days of service in Mississippi and led his brigade to Camp Beauregard, Kentucky, at which he served under General Leonidas Polk. His field service ended after his brigade was disbanded in January 1862. Alcorn was taken prisoner in Arkansas in 1862, was paroled later in the year, and returned to his Mound Place Plantation in Mississippi. In 1863, he was elected to the Mississippi state legislature, where he joined critics of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

During the war, Alcorn spent a fortune raising and supplying troops. Additionally, in 1863 his plantation was raided by General Leonard Ross&#x27; troops during the Yazoo Pass Expedition, part of the Vicksburg Campaign. However, he managed to preserve part of his wealth during the war by trading cotton with the North. In November 1863, Alcorn wrote to his wife: &quot;I have been very busy hiding &amp; selling my cotton. I have sold in all one hundred &amp; eleven bales, I have now here ten thousand dollars in paper (Green backs) and one thousand dollars in gold.&quot; After the war, he was estimated to be among the fifty wealthiest men in the South.

Alcorn lost two sons. His older son, James Lusk Alcorn Jr., committed suicide in 1879 after returning home from the war partially deaf and a drunkard. An inscription on the monument at the family cemetery attributes James&#x27; death to the &quot;insane war of rebellion&quot; (apparently his father&#x27;s words). Seventeen-year-old Henry &quot;Hal&quot; Alcorn ran away during the war to join the military against his father&#x27;s wishes, became ill, and was left behind and captured. He was held in Camp Chase and made his way to Richmond, Virginia after the surrender. He died of typhoid fever en route to Mississippi.

==Postbellum career==

Alcorn was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1865. However, he was prohibited from being seated in Congress, like all those disqualified from office for insurrection or rebellion against the United States for their participation in the Confederacy. He supported suffrage for freedmen and endorsed the Fourteenth Amendment. Alcorn became the leader of the scalawags, who comprised about a fourth of the Republican officials in the state, in coalition with carpetbaggers, African-Americans who had been free before the outbreak of the Civil War, and freedmen. Mississippi had a majority of African-Americans, the overwhelming majority of whom were freedmen. They had no desire to vote for the Democratic Party, which had carried the 1868 elections by intimidation and violence against blacks.

Thus the vast majority of votes for Republican candidates came from African-Americans, even though most of the Republican state officeholders in Mississippi were whites. In the 1869 election, James Alcorn was elected governor of Mississippi, defeating Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s brother-in-law Lewis Dent. Alcorn served as governor until 1871. As a modernizer, he appointed many like-minded former Whigs, some since Democrats. He strongly supported public schools for all and a new college exclusively for blacks, now known as Alcorn State University. He maneuvered to make his ally, Hiram Revels, the institution&#x27;s president. Irritated at his patronage policy, many Republicans opposed Alcorn. They were concerned as well over his understanding of African-American interests. His hostility to a state civil rights bill was well known; so was his unwillingness to appoint local black officers where a white alternative could be found. One complained that Alcorn&#x27;s policy was to see &quot;the old civilization of the South &quot;modernized&quot;&quot; rather than lead a total political, social, and economic revolution.

Alcorn resigned from the governorship to become a U.S. senator, with service from 1871 to 1877, when he was succeeded by L. Q. C. Lamar. He succeeded his ally, Hiram Revels, the first African American senator. Senator Alcorn urged the removal of the political disabilities of white southerners and rejected Republican proposals to end segregation in hotels, restaurants, and railroad cars by federal legislation; he denounced the federal cotton tax as robbery, and defended separate schools for both races in Mississippi. Although a former enslaver, he characterized slavery as &quot;a cancer upon the body of the nation&quot; and expressed the gratification he and many other Southerners felt over its destruction.

===New South politics===

Alcorn&#x27;s estrangement from Senator Adelbert Ames, his northern-born colleague, deepened in 1871, as African-Americans became convinced that the former governor was not taking the problem of white terrorism seriously enough. Alcorn resisted federal action to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, instead contending that state authorities were sufficient to handle the task. By 1873, the quarrel had deepened into an intense animosity. Both men ran for governor. Ames was supported by the Radicals and most African Americans, while Alcorn won the votes of most of the scalawags, moderately Whiggish whites. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490. Alcorn withdrew from active politics in the state and accused the new governor of being incapable and an enemy of the people. When a second African-American senator, Blanche Bruce, was elected in 1874, Alcorn refused to follow the customary procedure of introducing his new colleague to the Senate. Bruce was instead welcomed by New York senator Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the congressional &quot;Stalwart&quot; wing.

In 1875, when Reconstruction was fighting for its life against a campaign of violence from the Democrats, Alcorn emerged and led a white force against black Republicans at Friar&#x27;s Point. The aftermath led to at least five black people being killed.

During the Reconstruction period, Alcorn was an advocate of modernizing the South. Although a believer in white supremacy, he supported civil and political rights for African-Americans. In a letter to his wife (Amelia Alcorn, née Glover, of Rosemount Plantation in southern Alabama), he states that white Southerners must make African Americans their friend or the path ahead will be &quot;red with blood and damp with tears.&quot; Alcorn founded the Mississippi levee system and was instrumental in rebuilding the structures after the Civil War.

After he retired from politics, he was active in levee affairs. He was a delegate to the Mississippian constitutional convention of 1890, in which he supported the black disenfranchisement clause that the state&#x27;s Democrats had introduced in the new constitution. He was twice married: in 1839 to Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky, who died in 1849; and in 1850 to Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama. In his later life, Alcorn practiced law in Friars Point, Mississippi, and lived quietly at his home, &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in Coahoma County. He was interred upon his death in 1894 in the family cemetery. Alcorn commissioned a statue of himself, and after his death, it was placed on his grave.

<text>The Golden Girls is an American sitcom created by Susan Harris that aired on NBC from September 14, 1985, to May 9, 1992, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes, spanning seven seasons. The show&#x27;s ensemble cast stars Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty. It is about four older women who share a home in Miami, Florida. It was produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions, in association with Touchstone Television. Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas, and Harris served as the original executive producers.

&quot;The Golden Girls&quot; received critical acclaim throughout most of its run, and won several awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series twice. It also won three Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. Each of the four stars received an Emmy Award, making it one of only four sitcoms in the award&#x27;s history to achieve this. The series also ranked among the Nielsen ratings&#x27; top ten for six of its seven seasons. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; number 54 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time. In 2014, the Writers Guild of America placed the sitcom at number 69 in their list of the &quot;101 Best Written TV Series of All Time&quot;. Terry Tang of the Associated Press reported that the series continues to attract new fans in the 21st century and characterized it as an example of a sitcom that has aged well.

==Premise==
The show, featuring an ensemble cast, revolves around four older single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur) after they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store a year before the start of the series. In the pilot episode, the three are joined by Dorothy&#x27;s 80-year-old widowed mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she lived burned down.

===Pilot===
The first episode features a cook/butler named Coco (played by Charles Levin), but the role was dropped before the second episode. The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food. They decided that a separate cook would distract from their friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested positively with preview audiences, so the producers decided to make her a regular character.

The pilot was taped on April 17, 1985.

===Finale===
&quot;The Golden Girls&quot; came to an end when Bea Arthur chose to leave the series. In the hour-long series finale, which aired in May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche&#x27;s uncle Lucas (Leslie Nielsen) and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in Atlanta. Sophia is to join her, but in the end, she stays behind with the other women in Miami. This led into the spin-off series &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;.

The series finale of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was watched by 27.2 million viewers. As of 2016, it was the 17th-most watched television finale.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
*Bea Arthur as Dorothy Zbornak (née Petrillo, later Zbornak-Hollingsworth), a substitute teacher born in Brooklyn, New York City to Sicilian immigrants Sophia and Salvadore &quot;Sal&quot; Petrillo. Dorothy became pregnant while still in high school, resulting in a marriage to Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Zbornak (Herb Edelman) to legitimize the baby. Stan and Dorothy divorced after 38 years when Stan left the marriage for a young flight attendant. The marriage produced two children, Kate and Michael. In the series&#x27; final episode, Dorothy marries Blanche&#x27;s uncle, Lucas Hollingsworth, and relocates to Atlanta. In season one, episode seven, Dorothy is stated to be 55. She is practical, sarcastic, short-tempered, and a follower of current events.
*Betty White as Rose Nylund (née Lindström), a Norwegian American, from the small farming town of St. Olaf, Minnesota. Often naive and known for her humorously peculiar stories of life growing up in her hometown, Rose was happily married to Charlie Nylund, with whom she had five children: daughters Kirsten, Bridget, and Gunilla, and sons Adam and Charlie Jr. Upon her husband&#x27;s death, she moved to Miami. She eventually finds work at a grief counseling center, but later switches careers and becomes assistant to a consumer reporter, Enrique Mas, at a local TV station. In later seasons, Rose becomes romantically involved with college professor Miles Webber. During season six, Miles is revealed to have been in the Witness Protection Program. Their relationship continues throughout the series and briefly into the sequel series, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;. Rose is sweet, kind, and very competitive. Many of the jokes about Rose focus on her perceived lack of intelligence.
*Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux (née Hollingsworth), a Southern belle, employed at an art museum. Born into a wealthy family, Blanche grew up on a plantation outside of Atlanta, Georgia, prior to her relocation to Miami, where she lived with her husband, George, until his death. Their marriage produced five children: daughters Janet and Rebecca, and sons Doug, Biff, and Matthew (nicknamed &quot;Skippy&quot;). A widow, Blanche is portrayed as self-absorbed and man-hungry, although she still mourns her husband. She has two sisters, Virginia and Charmaine, and a younger brother, Clayton. Another brother, Tad, is seen in the spin-off series. Many of the jokes about Blanche focus on her promiscuity.
*Estelle Getty as Sophia Petrillo (née Grisanti, previously Petrillo-Weinstock), Dorothy&#x27;s mother; born in Sicily, Sophia moved to New York after fleeing an arranged marriage to Guido Spirelli. She married Salvadore &quot;Sal&quot; Petrillo, with whom she had three children: Dorothy, Gloria, and Phil, a cross-dresser who later dies of a heart attack (episode &quot;Ebbtide&#x27;s Revenge&quot;). Initially a resident of the Shady Pines retirement home (after having had a stroke prior to the start of the series), she moved in with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy following a fire at the institution. Sophia is portrayed as a quick-witted straight talker and a great cook. Despite portaying Dorothy&#x27;s elderly mother, in reality, Getty was a year younger than Arthur.

===Recurring===
* Herb Edelman as Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Zbornak, Dorothy&#x27;s cheating, freeloading ex-husband, who left her to marry a young flight attendant, who later left him. Stan married another woman, Catherine, in season four, but they divorced off-screen in season five. Stanley worked as an unsuccessful novelty item salesman until he became a successful entrepreneur by inventing the &quot;Zbornie&quot;, which was a utensil used to open baked potatoes. Many of Stan&#x27;s plot lines were centered around the fact that Dorothy was still bitter about their divorce and the way he left her. Attempts at reconciliation were made by both Stan and Dorothy throughout the series, particularly episode 12 of season one and episodes 16 and 17 of season six. They made peace in the series finale when Stan accepted Dorothy&#x27;s decision to marry Lucas Hollingsworth.
* Harold Gould as Miles Webber, Rose&#x27;s professor boyfriend from season five onwards. In season six, Miles reveals he is in the witness protection program and was a bookkeeper for a mobster. Gould also guest-starred once in the first season as Arnie Peterson, Rose&#x27;s first serious boyfriend after her husband Charlie&#x27;s death.
* Sid Melton as Salvadore &quot;Sal&quot; Petrillo, Sophia&#x27;s late husband, is usually seen in dreams or flashback sequences. Melton also appears as Don the Fool, a waiter at a medieval-themed restaurant in season six.
* Shawn Schepps and Debra Engle as Blanche&#x27;s daughter, Rebecca Devereaux. She was an overweight former model in an emotionally abusive relationship, but she later slimmed down and had a baby girl named Aurora by artificial insemination.
* Monte Markham and Sheree North as Blanche&#x27;s siblings Clayton Hollingsworth and Virginia Hollingsworth Warren. Virginia and Blanche were estranged from each other for a long time, until they reconciled in season one. They became estranged again in season five after their father&#x27;s funeral. Clayton is a closeted gay man who had trouble coming out to Blanche. She eventually accepted Clayton and his new boyfriend when the two got married.
* Bill Dana and Nancy Walker portrayed Sophia&#x27;s siblings Angelo Grisanti and Angela Grisanti Vecchio. Bill Dana appears in seven episodes (seasons three-seven), while he also played Sophia&#x27;s father in a fourth season episode. Nancy Walker starred in two episodes in season two.
* Doris Belack and Dena Dietrich as Gloria Petrillo-Harker, Dorothy&#x27;s younger sister. She is married to a wealthy man in California. In a two-part episode in Season 7, she has lost all of her money and becomes romantically involved with Stan, but she eventually comes to think of him as a &quot;yutz&quot; and breaks up with him.
* Scott Jacoby is Dorothy&#x27;s traveling musician son Michael Zbornak; in season three, he married Lorraine Wagner, an older black woman who sang with his band, but by season five, they are divorced. 
* Lynnie Greene (credited as Lyn Greene) is a younger Dorothy in flashbacks.
* Lisa Jane Persky and Deena Freeman portrayed Dorothy&#x27;s daughter, Kate Zbornak-Griffiths. She was an interior decorator in New York, married to Dennis Griffiths, a podiatrist.

==Production==

===Creation===
Ideas for a comedy series about older women emerged during the filming of a television special at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984. Produced to introduce the network&#x27;s 1984–85 season schedule, two actresses appearing on NBC shows, Selma Diamond of &quot;Night Court&quot; and Doris Roberts of &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, appeared in a skit promoting the upcoming show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as &quot;Miami Nice&quot;, a parody about old people living in Miami. NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield was among the executive producers in the audience who were amused by their performance, and he envisioned a series based on the geriatric humor the two were portraying.

Shortly afterward, he met with producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, who were pitching a show about a female lawyer. Though Littlefield nixed their idea, he asked if they would be interested in delivering a pilot script for &quot;Miami Nice&quot;, instead. Their regular writer declined, so Witt asked his wife, Susan Harris, who had been semiretired since the conclusion of their ABC series &quot;Soap&quot;. She found the concept interesting, as &quot;it was a demographic that had never been addressed,&quot; and she soon began work on it. Though her vision of a sitcom about women in their 60s differed from NBC&#x27;s request for a comedy about women around 40 years old, Littlefield was impressed when he received her pilot script and subsequently approved production of it. &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; director Jay Sandrich, who had previously worked with Harris, Witt, and Thomas on &quot;Soap&quot;, agreed to direct the pilot episode.

The pilot included a gay houseboy, Coco (Charles Levin), who lived with the girls. Levin had been suggested by then-NBC president Brandon Tartikoff based on Levin&#x27;s groundbreaking portrayal of a recurring gay character, Eddie Gregg, on NBC&#x27;s Emmy-winning drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. After the pilot, the character of Coco was eliminated from the series.

The Walt Disney Company, NBC Studios and the creators were named in a federal copyright infringement suit filed by Nancy Bretzfield claiming the show was based on a script rejected by NBC in 1980. The suit was later settled.

===Casting===
The part of Sophia Petrillo was the first of the four roles to be cast. Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role as the feisty mother of character Dorothy Zbornak, due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York, her manager allowed her to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she were unsuccessful.

Casting director Judith Weiner had seen &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;, and thought Getty was terrific in it. She was also impressed by Getty&#x27;s audition for the role of the mother of Steven Keaton (played by actor Michael Gross) for a guest episode of &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Although Getty was impressive, the show&#x27;s producers went with another actress. Getty came to Weiner&#x27;s mind soon after, when it became time to begin casting of &quot;The Golden Girls.&quot;

Getty, who went through a three-hour transformation to become Sophia, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to look the part. The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young. Disney&#x27;s Michael Eisner explains, &quot;Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it seem like it could be a contemporary, young show.&quot; Getty continuously battled stage fright during her tenure on the show. In a 1988 interview, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.

Hired to shoot the pilot, director Jay Sandrich also became instrumental in helping to cast the roles of Blanche Devereaux and Rose Nylund. Both Rue McClanahan and Betty White came into consideration, as the series &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, in which the two co-starred, had been cancelled by NBC. Producers wanted to cast McClanahan as Rose and White as Blanche based on roles they had previously played; White portrayed the man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, while McClanahan co-starred as the sweet but scatterbrained Vivian Harmon in &quot;Maude&quot;. Eager not to be typecast, they took the suggestion of Sandrich and switched roles at the last minute.

In the pilot script, Blanche was described as &quot;more Southern than Blanche DuBois&quot;, so McClanahan was perplexed when she was asked by director Sandrich during the filming of the pilot not to use the strong Southern accent she had developed, but to use her natural Oklahoma accent instead. Once the show was picked up for a first season, new director Paul Bogart felt exactly the opposite, insisting that McClanahan use a Southern accent. McClanahan deliberately exaggerated her accent, stating, &quot;I played Blanche the way I felt Blanche. She thought an accentuated Southern accent... would be sexy and strong and attractive to men. She wanted to be a Southern heroine, like Vivien Leigh. In fact, that&#x27;s who I think she thought she was.&quot;

Though Harris had created the character of Dorothy with a &quot;Bea Arthur type&quot; in mind, Littlefield and the producers initially envisioned actress Elaine Stritch for the part. Stritch&#x27;s audition flopped, however, and under the impression that Arthur did not want to participate, Harris asked McClanahan if she could persuade Arthur, with whom she worked previously on the CBS sitcom &quot;Maude&quot;, to take the role. Arthur flipped upon reading the script, but felt hesitant about McClanahan&#x27;s approach, as she did not &quot;want to play (their &quot;Maude&quot; characters) Maude and Vivian meet Sue Ann Nivens.&quot; She reconsidered, however, after hearing that McClanahan and White had switched roles.

Arthur and White worked well together in shared mutual respect, but they did not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; set. Arthur&#x27;s son, Matthew Saks, later spoke of tension between the two actresses, stating that his mother, &quot;unknowingly carried the attitude that it was fun to have somebody to be angry at...It was almost like Betty became her nemesis, someone she could always roll her eyes about at work.&quot; Both actresses had dramatically different training and acting backgrounds; Saks commented on White&#x27;s habit of breaking the fourth wall to engage and joke with the studio audience during breaks between filming, which Arthur found unprofessional. In 2011, White stated that she believed it was her &quot;positive attitude&quot; and perky demeanor that got on Arthur&#x27;s nerves. However, Arthur preferred that all four castmates break together for workday lunch.

===Writing and taping===
The show was the second television series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company under the Touchstone Television label, and was subsequently distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc. (which holds as the ownership stake in Disney Channel Southeast Asia, now Disney–ABC Television Group).

Creator Susan Harris went on to contribute another four episodes to the first season, but became less involved with the sitcom throughout its run; she continued reading all scripts, however, and remained familiar with most of the storylines. Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman were the first head writers of the series, and wrote for the show&#x27;s first four seasons. As head writers, Speer and Grossman, along with Mort Nathan and Barry Fanaro, who won an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for the first season, gave general ideas to lower staff writers, and personally wrote a handful of scripts each season.

In 1989, Marc Sotkin, previously a writer on &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and a producer on another Witt/Thomas series, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, assumed head writing responsibilities, and guided the show (to varying degrees) during what were its final three seasons. Richard Vaczy and Tracy Gamble, previously writers on &quot;227&quot; and &quot;My Two Dads&quot;, also assumed the roles of producers and head writers. Beginning in 1990, Marc Cherry served as writer and producer, years before creating &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, which ran on ABC from 2004 to 2012. Mitchell Hurwitz also served as writer for the show in its last two seasons. Hurwitz later created &quot;Arrested Development&quot; for Fox and later for Netflix.

Cherry commented on read-throughs of the scripts that &quot;generally, if the joke was a good one, the women found a way to make it work the very first time they read it. You have a lot of table reads where the actors will mess it up because they don&#x27;t understand what the characters are doing, or they misinterpret. But the women were so uniformly brilliant at nailing it the first time... we basically knew that if the women didn&#x27;t get it right the first time, the joke needed to be replaced.&quot; According to Cherry, the writers&#x27; room was &quot;a competitive atmosphere. There was a lot of competition to get your words into the script.&quot; Writer Christopher Lloyd explained that the usual situation was for all of the more junior writers to be assigned the same scene to write, with the one judged the best version becoming the one chosen. This &quot;created a great deal of stress and competitiveness amongst those of us who weren&#x27;t in that inner sanctum.&quot;

After season three, Arthur had expressed her growing dissatisfaction with the disparaging jokes made about her physical appearance, which were often in the scripts. She expressed that she would not continue if changes were not made, but changes were made and jokes regarding Dorothy&#x27;s physique appeared less often. Christopher Lloyd later said, &quot;I think that was a mistake we made, to be a little bit insensitive to someone who was an extremely sensitive person... I think we pushed that [the jokes about Arthur&#x27;s appearance] a little bit far and I think she let it be known she didn&#x27;t love that.&quot;

Estelle Getty&#x27;s stage fright, which affected her from the beginning of the show, grew worse as the show went on. According to McClanahan, by the end of season three, Getty had significant problems remembering her lines, which was attributed to anxiety. To aid her retention, Getty tried hypnosis, and the show hired an assistant to run lines with her before taping; neither method worked. She took to writing her lines on props at which she could glance easily, like the wicker purse Sophia always carried with her. The cast often had to stay behind after the audience had departed to redo scenes where Getty had flubbed her lines, and although this was at first met with resistance from the producers, cue cards were eventually introduced to help her. Rue McClanahan, who shared a dressing room with Getty, described the severity of Getty&#x27;s stage fright: &quot;She&#x27;d panic. She would start getting under a dark cloud the day before tape day... You could see a big difference in her that day. She&#x27;d be walking around like Pig-Pen, under a black cloud. By tape day, she was unreachable. She was just as uptight as a human being could get. When your brain is frozen like that, you can&#x27;t remember lines.&quot; Getty died in 2008, the result of dementia with Lewy bodies. Her co-stars, in an interview, said that her disease had progressed to the point that she was not able to hold conversations with them or recognize them. Her difficulties remembering lines were later thought to be early signs of her dementia.

During season six, some uncertainty arose over whether Bea Arthur would commit to future seasons, or leave the show once her contract expired, to pursue other projects. Arthur felt the characters had been in every possible scenario, and wanted to end the series while it was still successful. Debbie Reynolds was brought on as a guest star in the season six episode &quot;There Goes the Bride: Part 2&quot; to test her chemistry with the other actresses as a possible replacement for Arthur, but Arthur chose to commit to a seventh and final season.

===Exterior and interior sets===
The house&#x27;s address was mentioned as being 6151 Richmond Street, Miami. The model used for exterior shots of the house from the third season through the end of the series was part of the backstage studio tour ride at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. This façade, along with the &quot;Empty Nest&quot; house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney&#x27;s 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of &quot;Residential Street&quot; and construct its Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show attraction, later replaced by &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge. The façade was based on a real house at 245 North Saltair Avenue in the Westgate Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. Producers used this residence for exterior shots during the first two seasons. In 2020, owners marketed the property for $3 million.

The show&#x27;s designer, Ed Stephenson, took inspiration from his time living in Florida to design a &quot;Florida look&quot; for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; house set. The wooden accents, columns, and doors were painted to mimic bald cypress wood, popular in South Florida homes, with rattan furniture and tropical-printed upholstery chosen for the furniture.

The kitchen set seen on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was originally used on an earlier Witt/Thomas/Harris series, &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, which aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. However, the exterior backdrop seen through the kitchen window changed from the view of Chicago high-rises to palm trees and bushes for the Miami setting. Space was limited on the soundstage, so when the kitchen was off camera, it was usually detached from the rest of the set and the space used for something else. The doorway from the living room, with the alcove and baker&#x27;s shelf just inside, was designed to give the illusion that the actors were walking into and out of the kitchen.

===Costumes===
Costume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their characters&#x27; personalities and to reflect the Florida setting. According to Evans, &quot;I wanted a sexy, soft, and flowing look for Rue, a tailored, pulled-together look for Bea, a down-home look for Betty, and comfort for Estelle.&quot; Anna Wyckoff of the Costume Designers Guild wrote, &quot;Evans took the direction from the producers to create a vibrant look for the four mature leads, and ran with it...redefining what &#x27;dressing your age&#x27; looked like.&quot; Many of the characters&#x27; outfits were designed by Evans and made especially, but seven to ten costume changes per episode were made between the four actresses, which entailed a great deal of off-the-rack shopping. Evans generally dressed the actresses in expensive pieces and high-quality fabrics, despite the recurring theme that the four characters were struggling with money, because, &quot;The main idea was to make them look good. We didn&#x27;t want the show to be about four dowdy ladies.&quot;

Bea Arthur had a preference for wearing loose-fitting clothing, like slacks and long sweaters, along with sandals, because she hated wearing shoes. She had established this signature look while playing Maude, and Evans honored it in her designs for Dorothy. Much of Arthur&#x27;s wardrobe was custom-made because at the time, finding off-the-rack clothing that was flattering for a taller woman was difficult. Rue McClanahan had a special clause written into her contract allowing her to keep her costumes, which were mostly custom-made for her, utilising expensive fabrics. Eventually, McClanahan went on to create a clothing line for QVC called &quot;A Touch of Rue&quot;, inspired by Blanche, but made with affordable fabrics and practical designs.

&quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was shot on videotape in front of a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake, ice cream, or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled the others with a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous, made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Although the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. Bea Arthur actually hated cheesecake.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Golden Girls&quot; premiered to widespread acclaim, which it maintained throughout its run. On Metacritic, the series has an overall score of 82 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

During the NBC upfronts, the preview screening of the show got a standing ovation. The show promptly received a full order of 12 episodes.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; number 54 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time. In 2014, the Writers Guild of America placed the sitcom at number 69 in their list of the &quot;101 Best Written TV Series of All Time&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; #18 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time. Terry Tang of the Associated Press reported that the series continues to attract new fans in the 21st century and characterized it as an example of a sitcom that has aged well.

===Ratings===
An instant ratings hit, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; became an NBC staple on Saturday nights. The show was the anchor of NBC&#x27;s Saturday line-up, and almost always won its time slot, as ABC and CBS struggled to find shows to compete against it, the most notable being ABC&#x27;s Lucille Ball sitcom &quot;Life With Lucy&quot; in the beginning of the 1986–87 season although it aired at 8:00, an hour earlier. &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was part of a series of Brandon Tartikoff shows that put an end to NBC&#x27;s ratings slump, along with &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Law.&quot;

The show dealt with many controversial issues, such as coming out and same-sex marriage, elder care, homelessness, poverty, HIV/AIDS and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, US immigration policy, menopause, sexual harassment, teenaged pregnancy, artificial insemination, adultery, bad medical care, sexism, miscegenation and interracial marriage, antisemitism, age discrimination, environmentalism, addiction to pain killers, problem gambling, nuclear war, death, and assisted suicide.

Writer and producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason created a sitcom with this kind of image as a &quot;four women&quot; show, which became &quot;Designing Women&quot; on CBS. &quot;Designing Women&quot; began competing against &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. 

At the request of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who was reputedly a big fan, the cast of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; performed several skits as their characters in front of her and other members of the British royal family at the 1988 Royal Variety Performance in London.

===NBC timeslots===
* Seasons one-six: Saturday at 9:00 pm
* Season seven: Saturday at 8:00 pm

===Controversial episode===
The Season 3 episode &quot;Mixed Blessings&quot; was noted as controversial. In it, Dorothy&#x27;s son Michael (Scott Jacoby) plans to marry a black woman, Lorraine (Rosalind Cash). In one scene, Blanche and Rose walk out of the kitchen wearing mud masks and Rose says &quot;We&#x27;re not black.&quot; Hulu pulled the episode in 2020 due to blackface concerns but, as an article in &quot;Vulture&quot; pointed out this was not an example of blackface; they were just mud masks. As of 2023, the episode is back streaming on Hulu.

==Accolades==

During its original run, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; received 68 Emmy nominations, 11 Emmy awards, 4 Golden Globe Awards, and 2 Viewers for Quality Television awards. All the lead actresses won Emmy awards for their role on the show. &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; is one of four live-action shows, along with &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, where all the principal actors have won at least one Emmy.

As a tribute to the success of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, all four actresses were later named Disney Legends as part of the class of 2009.

==Distribution==

===Syndication===
Beginning July 3, 1989, NBC added daytime reruns of the show, replacing long-running &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (which had moved to CBS) on the NBC schedule at 11:00 am(EST); it ran until September 1990. At this time, syndicated reruns began airing, distributed by Buena Vista Television (now Disney–ABC Domestic Television), the syndication arm of Disney, whose Touchstone Television division produced the series.

In March 1997, the Lifetime cable network acquired the exclusive rights to repeat the episodes of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in the US until March 1, 2009. Many episodes were edited to allow more commercials and for content.

Both the Hallmark Channel and WE tv picked-up the reruns in March 2009. As of February 2013, WE tv&#x27;s rights expired and Viacom networks&#x27; TV Land, home to Betty White&#x27;s last series &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, purchased them, as did Logo TV. In 2020, CMT purchased the rights to the series.

In Australia, the show airs Weekends on FOX Comedy. As of 2019, every episode is available for streaming on Stan. As of December 1, 2021, every episode was made available to stream on Disney+.

In Canada, Corus Entertainment&#x27;s digital specialty channel, DejaView, aired reruns of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; until 2017. As of September 8, 2021 all 7 seasons of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; were made available to stream on Disney+ in Canada.

In Germany, airing of the show started in January 1990, only months before the German reunification, by German public broadcaster ARD in the late evening programme on their main channel Das Erste. The show was aired as a bilingual broadcast using a two-channel sound system (Zweikanalton). If technically supported by the home television, this system allowed their audience to watch the show either in the dubbed German version (by default) or the original English version. After reruns on different regional channels of the ARD Network, the show later aired on private channels RTL, VOX, Super RTL, Disney Channel and RTLup. While RTL initially chose to cut some scenes for time, some of the gags remain incomprehensible for their broadcast and all subsequent reruns, only to be restored partially for the release of DVD in 2005. As of September 15, 2021, every episode was made available to stream on Disney+ in Germany and Austria.

In Italy, the series aired on Rai Uno (or Rai 1) as &quot;Cuori senza età&quot; (&quot;Ageless Hearts&quot;) from 1987 until 1994.

In Israel, the show was broadcast in Israeli Educational Television on its transmission strip on Channel 1, and in 1993, it was moved to IETV&#x27;s transmission strip on Channel 2 right after it went on air. In February 2024, the whole series was up on the Israeli Disney+.

In Southeast Asia, Rewind Networks began airing reruns of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; on its HD channel, HITS, in 2013.

In New Zealand, the series aired on TVNZ and is replayed on public holidays and on Sunday afternoons. It was shown on Jones!.

In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Channel 4, Living and Disney Channel. Another brief run of the show began on 27 April 2020 till summer 2020 on Channel 5, but only showed episodes up to the season-four finale and is returning to Channel 4 starting from early 2022.

In Ireland, the series has been airing on TG4 since 2021.

Every episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was made available to stream on Hulu on February 13, 2017.

==Film==

&quot;Forever Golden: A Celebration of The Golden Girls&quot; released in select movie theaters across North America via Fathom Events on September 14, 2021, marking the show&#x27;s 36th anniversary. The film featured five episodes from the show: &quot;The Pilot&quot;, &quot;The Flu&quot;, &quot;The Way We Met&quot;, &quot;Ladies of the Evening&quot; and &quot;Grab That Dough&quot;.

==Home media==
Buena Vista Home Entertainment has released all seven seasons, with edits, of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; on DVD in Region 1 and Region 4 with the first four being released in Region 2. On November 9, 2010, the studio released a complete-series box set titled &quot;The Golden Girls: 25th Anniversary Complete Collection&quot;. The 21-disc collection features all 180 episodes of the series as well as all special features contained on the previously released season sets; it is encased in special collectible packaging, a replica of Sophia&#x27;s purse. On November 15, 2005, Warner Home Video released &quot;The Golden Girls: A Lifetime Intimate Portrait Series&quot; on DVD which contains a separate biography of Arthur, White, McClanahan and Getty, revealing each woman&#x27;s background, rise to stardom and private life, which originally aired on Lifetime network between June 2000 and January 2003.

==Continuation and spin-offs==

===&quot;The Golden Palace&quot;===

After the original series ended, White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their characters in the CBS series &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, which featured Rose, Blanche, and Sophia selling their house to buy and run a hotel in Miami. It ran from September 1992 to May 1993 and also starred Cheech Marin and Don Cheadle. Bea Arthur was not a part of the main cast but did guest star in a double episode, reprising her role as Dorothy.

The show never approached the popularity or acclaim of the original, and ranked 57th in the annual ratings. Reportedly, a second season was approved before being cancelled the day before the network announced its 1993–94 schedule.

Lifetime, which held the rights to &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; at the time, aired reruns of &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; in the summer of 2005, and again in December of that year. This was the first time since 1993 that &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; was seen on American television. Until April 2006, Lifetime played the series as a virtual season eight, airing the series in between the conclusion of the final season and the syndicated roll-over to season one.

For White&#x27;s 100th Birthday on January 10, 2022, &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; began streaming on Hulu.

===&quot;Empty Nest&quot;===
Susan Harris developed a spin-off centering on empty nest syndrome. The initial pilot was aired as the 1987 &quot;Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Empty Nests&quot;, and starred Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno as George and Renee Corliss, a married couple living next to the &quot;Golden Girls&quot; characters, who face empty nest syndrome after their teenaged daughter goes to college. When that idea was not well received, Harris retooled the series as a vehicle for Richard Mulligan, and the following year &quot;Empty Nest&quot; debuted, starring Mulligan as pediatrician Harry Weston, a widower whose two adult daughters moved back home.

Characters from both shows made occasional crossover guest appearances on the other show, with the four girls guesting on &quot;Empty Nest&quot; and Mulligan, Dinah Manoff, Kristy McNichol, David Leisure, and Park Overall appearing on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in their &quot;Empty Nest&quot; roles. After the end of &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, Getty joined the cast of &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, making frequent appearances as Sophia in the show&#x27;s final two seasons. Mulligan and Manoff were alumni from one of Susan Harris&#x27; earlier shows, &quot;Soap&quot;.

===&quot;Nurses&quot;===

&quot;Empty Nest&quot; launched its own spin-off in 1991 set in Miami in the same hospital where Dr. Weston worked. The series starred Stephanie Hodge and a set of other young nurses. As one of the few times in television history where three shows from the same producer, set in the same city, aired back-to-back-to-back on the same network, the three shows occasionally took advantage of their unique circumstance to create storylines carrying through all three series, such as &quot;Hurricane Saturday&quot;.

Starring actress Hodge left after two seasons, David Rasche joined the cast at the start of the second season, and Loni Anderson was added as the new hospital administrator in the third.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===
&quot;The Golden Girls: Live!&quot; was an off-Broadway show that opened in the summer of 2003 in New York City at Rose&#x27;s Turn theater in the West Village, and ran until November of that year. The production ended because the producers failed to secure the rights and received a cease-and-desist order by the creators of the original television show. Featuring an all-male cast in drag, &quot;The Golden Girls: Live!&quot; consisted of two back-to-back episodes of the sitcom: &quot;Break-In&quot; (season one, episode eight) and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot; (season two, episode five).

&quot;The Golden Girls: The Laughs Continue&quot; opened with an all-male cast in drag on December 14, 2023, in Los Angeles. The production stars Christopher Kamm, Adam Graber, Ryan Bernier, and Vince Kelley. The play was written by Robert Leleux and directed by Eric Swanson.

The cast of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Sophia, Dorothy, Blanche, and Rose, have been even further immortalized in two puppet parody shows &quot;Thank You For Being A Friend&quot; and &quot;That Golden Girls Show: A Puppet Parody&quot;, both created by Australian screenwriter Thomas Duncan-Watt and producer Jonathan Rockefeller.

===Animation===
&quot;Golden Girls 3033&quot; is an animated pilot created by Mike Hollingsworth. The pilot takes audio from the sitcom and sets it against a futuristic background inspired by &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.

===Books===
In 2025, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; is set to become a cozy mystery book series. The first book, &quot;Murder by Cheesecake: A Golden Girls Cozy Mystery&quot;, by author Rachel Ekstrom Courage, is set to be released April 15, 2025.

===International versions===
* Chile: &quot;&quot;: In 2015, a Chilean remake called &quot;Los Años Dorados&quot; (&quot;The Golden Years&quot;) was produced by UCVTV in agreement with Disney, starring Chilean actresses Gloria Münchmeyer, Carmen Barros, Ana Reeves, and Consuelo Holzapfel, who live their retirement in the city of Viña del Mar. It was a success for the channel and plans were made for a second season in 2016, but that was not produced. 
* Israel: &quot;Bnot HaZahav&quot; ran from 2011 to 2016.
* Greece: In 2008, Greek broadcaster ET1 premiered a Greek remake entitled &quot;Chrysa Koritsia&quot; (, &quot;Gold[en] Girls&quot;), which features the four women in Greece. Each of the characters has been hellenized to suit the culture and modern setting. Names were only slightly changed, but more for cultural reasons, as Sophia (whose first name was unchanged, as it is Greek), Bela (Blanche), Dora (Dorothy), Fifi (Rose), and Panos (Stan). The series began airing in mid-January, and features many similar plots to the original. ET1 aired a rerun of the show in the summer of 2008 and managed to take a place in the top-10 ratings chart, presented by AGB Nielsen Media Research. The Greek edition features Mirka Papakonstantinou as Dora, Dina Konsta as Sofia, Eleni Gerasimidou as Fifi, and Ivonni Maltezou as Bela.
* Netherlands: &quot;:&quot; A Dutch remake for the RTL 4 network stars Loes Luca as Barbara (Blanche), Beppie Melissen as Els (Dorothy), Cecile Heuer as Milly (Rose), and Pleuni Touw as Toos (Sophia). The show premiered in fall 2012, using essentially the same plots as the U.S. version, along with a Dutch-language version of the original theme song, &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend&quot;.
* The Philippines: &quot;50 Carats, O Di Ba?&quot; A Philippine version of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; aired during the early 1990s by IBC 13 starred Nida Blanca, Charito Solis, and Gloria Romero.
* Russia: &quot;Bolshie Devochki&quot;: A Russian remake was broadcast on Channel One in 2006, entitled &quot;Bolshie Devochki&quot; (), which in English can literally be translated to: &quot;Grown Girls&quot;. The series featured renowned Russian actresses Galina Petrova as Irina (Dorothy), Olga Ostroumova as Nadejda (Blanche), Valentina Telechkina as Margarita (Rose), and Elena Millioti as Sofya (Sophia). However, the concept never caught on with Russian viewers and the show was canceled after only 32 episodes.
* Spain: &#x27;/&#x27;: In 1996, TVE launched a Spanish remake entitled &quot;Juntas pero no revueltas&quot; (&quot;Together, but not mixed&quot;) with Mercedes Sampietro as Julia (Dorothy), Mónica Randall as Nuri (Blanche), Kiti Manver as Rosa (Rose), and Amparo Baró as Benigna (Sophia). Low ratings made it disappear after one season. In 2010, another remake with the title &quot;Las chicas de oro&quot; (&quot;The Golden Girls&quot;) was announced, again on TVE, this time produced by José Luis Moreno and with Concha Velasco as Doroti (Dorothy), Carmen Maura as Rosa (Rose), Lola Herrera as Blanca (Blanche), and Alicia Hermida as Sofía (Sophia). The series premiered on September 13, 2010, with success. However, after only 26 episodes, the series was eventually discontinued after the end of the first season after receiving generally bad reviews and following dropping ratings.
* Portugal: &quot;Queridas e Maduras&quot;: In July 1995, RTP premiered &quot;Queridas e Maduras&quot; (in English, &quot;Dear Mature Girls&quot;) a Portuguese version of the American sitcom. The show featured renowned Portuguese actresses Catarina Avelar as &quot;Edite&quot; (Dorothy), Amélia Videira as &quot;Inês&quot; (Rose), Lia Gama as &quot;Salomé&quot; (Blanche) and the veteran actress Luísa Barbosa as &quot;Aparecida&quot; (Sophia). The Portuguese version got two seasons, the first in 1995 and the second in 1996, adapting episode plots from the first two seasons of the original series.
* Turkey: &quot;&quot;. In 2009, broadcaster ATV premiered &quot;Altın Kızlar&quot; (literally translated to English as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;). It was produced by Play Prodüksiyon. Rather than residing in Miami, the women shared a condo in residential part of Beyoğlu. As in other foreign adaptations, it featured well-known local actresses. The key roles were filled by Fatma Girik as &quot;Safıye&quot; (the &#x27;Sophia&#x27; character), Hülya Koçyiğit as &quot;İsmet&quot; (&#x27;Dorothy&#x27;), Nevra Serezli as &quot;Gönül&quot; (&#x27;Blanche&#x27;) and Türkan Şoray as &quot;Inci&quot; (&#x27;Rose&#x27;). The show lasted only one episode, consisting of story lines from two of the original American series: &quot;The Engagement&quot; (Season 1, Episode 1) and &quot;The Triangle&quot; (Season 1, Episode 5). 
* United Kingdom: &quot;Brighton Belles&quot;: In 1993, ITV premiered &quot;Brighton Belles&quot;, a British version of the American sitcom. The show, starring Sheila Hancock, Wendy Craig, Sheila Gish, and Jean Boht, was nearly identical to &quot;Girls&quot; except for character name changes and actor portrayals. The 10-episode series was canceled after six weeks due to low ratings, with the final four episodes airing more than a year later.

==Restaurant==
In 2017, a &quot;Golden Girls&quot;-themed eatery, Rue la Rue Cafe owned by Rue McClanahan&#x27;s close friend Michael La Rue, who inherited many of the star&#x27;s personal belongings and in turn decorated the restaurant with them, opened in the Washington Heights section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The eatery closed in November 2017 after less than a year of operation.

<text>Beatrice Arthur (born Bernice Frankel; May 13, 1922 – April 25, 2009) was an American actress, comedienne and singer. She began her career on stage in 1947, attracting critical acclaim before achieving worldwide recognition for her work on television beginning in the 1970s as Maude Findlay in the popular sitcoms &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1972) and &quot;Maude&quot; (1972–1978) and later in the 1980s and 1990s as Dorothy Zbornak on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1985–1992).

Arthur won several accolades throughout her career, beginning with the 1966 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for playing Vera Charles in &quot;Mame&quot;. She won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1977 for &quot;Maude&quot; and 1988 for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. Arthur has received the third most nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series with nine; after Julia Louis-Dreyfus (11) and Mary Tyler Moore (10). Arthur was inducted into the academy&#x27;s Television Hall of Fame in 2008.

Arthur&#x27;s film appearances include &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; (1970) and the film version of &quot;Mame&quot; (1974). In 2002, she starred in the one-woman show &quot;Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends&quot;. An obituary described Arthur as &quot;the tall, deep-voiced actress whose razor-sharp delivery of comedy lines made her a TV star.&quot;

==Early life, family, education and military service==
Bernice Frankel was born on May 13, 1922, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, to Rebecca (née Pressner, born in Austria) and Philip Frankel (born in Poland). Arthur was raised in a Jewish home with her older sister Gertrude and younger sister Marian (1926–2014).

In 1933, the Frankel family relocated to Cambridge, Maryland, where her parents subsequently operated a women&#x27;s clothing shop. At age 16, Beatrice developed a serious condition, coagulopathy, in which her blood would not clot. Concerned for her health, her parents sent her to Linden Hall, an all-girls&#x27; boarding school in Lititz, Pennsylvania, for her final two years of high school. Afterwards, she studied for a year at Blackstone College for Girls in Blackstone, Virginia.

During World War II, Frankel enlisted as one of the first members of the United States Marine Corps Women&#x27;s Reserve in 1943. After boot camp, she served as a typist at Marine headquarters in Washington, D.C. In June 1943, the Marine Corps accepted her transfer request to the Motor Transport School at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Frankel then worked as a truck driver and dispatcher in Cherry Point, North Carolina, between 1944 and 1945. She was honorably discharged at the rank of staff sergeant in September 1945.

After serving in the Marines, Frankel studied for a year at the Franklin School of Science and Arts in Philadelphia, where she became a licensed medical technician. After interning at a local hospital for the summer, she decided against working as a lab technician, departing for New York City in 1947 to enroll in the School of Drama at The New School.

==Career==
===Theater===
From 1947, Arthur studied at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York City with German director Erwin Piscator.

Arthur began her acting career as a member of an off-Broadway theater group at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York City in the late 1940s. Onstage, her roles included Lucy Brown in the 1954 Off-Broadway premiere of Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s English-language adaptation of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, Nadine Fesser in the 1957 premiere of Herman Wouk&#x27;s &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; at the Coronet Theatre, Yente the Matchmaker in the 1964 premiere of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; on Broadway.

In 1966, Arthur auditioned for the title role in the musical &quot;Mame&quot;, which her husband Gene Saks was set to direct, but Angela Lansbury (who would become a good friend of Arthur&#x27;s) won the role instead. Arthur accepted the supporting role of Vera Charles, for which she won great acclaim, winning a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical the same year. She reprised the role in the 1974 film version opposite Lucille Ball. In 1981, she appeared on stage in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Floating Light Bulb&quot;.

Arthur made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1994 portraying the Duchess of Krakenthorp in Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;. In 1995, she starred opposite Renée Taylor and Joseph Bologna in &quot;Bermuda Avenue Triangle&quot; in Los Angeles.

===Television===

Arthur accepted a 1971 invitation from Norman Lear to guest-star on his sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;, as Maude Findlay, the cousin of Edith Bunker. An outspoken liberal feminist, Maude was considered the antithesis to the reactionary character of Archie Bunker, who described her as a &quot;New Deal fanatic&quot;. At the age of 49, Arthur&#x27;s performance on &quot;All in the Family&quot; impressed viewers as well as television executives at CBS who, she would later recall, asked &quot;&#x27;Who is that girl? Let&#x27;s give her her own series.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Maude&quot; previewed in her second &quot;All in the Family&quot; appearance. Debuting in 1972, the series found her living in the affluent community of Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York, with her fourth husband, Walter (Bill Macy), and divorced daughter, Carol (Adrienne Barbeau). Arthur&#x27;s performance as Maude garnered her several Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for the series, with Arthur winning an Emmy in 1977 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. &quot;Maude&quot; earned a place for Arthur in the history of the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

The series addressed serious sociopolitical topics of the era that were considered taboo for a television sitcom, including the Vietnam War, the Nixon Administration, Maude&#x27;s bid for a Congressional seat, divorce, menopause, drug use, alcoholism, nervous breakdown, mental illness, women&#x27;s lib, gay rights, abortion, and spousal abuse. A prime example is &quot;Maude&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, a two-part episode airing near Thanksgiving 1972 in which Maude grapples with a late-life pregnancy, ultimately deciding to have an abortion. Even though abortion had been legal in New York state since 1970, as well as in California since its state&#x27;s 1969 on-demand ruling, it was illegal in many other regions of the country and, as such, the episode sparked controversy. As a result, dozens of network affiliates refused to broadcast the episode, substituting either a repeat from earlier in the season or a Thanksgiving TV special in its place. However, by the time of the summer rerun season six months later, the uproar was reduced, and the stations that had refused to air the episode upon its first run now ran it for broadcast. As a result, a reported 65 million viewers watched the two-episode arc either on first run that November or during the following summer. The episode first aired two months before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the procedure nationwide in the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; outcome in January 1973.

Arthur decided to exit the series during its sixth season. Later in 1978, she appeared in the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, in which she performed a song in the Mos Eisley cantina. She hosted &quot;The Beatrice Arthur Special&quot; for CBS on January 19, 1980, leading a musical comedy revue with Rock Hudson, Melba Moore, and Wayland Flowers with Madame.

Arthur returned to television in the short-lived 1983 sitcom &quot;Amanda&#x27;s&quot; (an adaptation of the British series &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;). Ten of the show&#x27;s thirteen episodes were aired.In 1985, Arthur was cast in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, in which she played Dorothy Zbornak, a divorced mother and substitute teacher living in a Miami, Florida, house owned by widow Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan, who had previously co-starred with Arthur in &quot;Maude&quot;). Her other roommates included widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and Dorothy&#x27;s Sicilian mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty). The series was a massive hit and remained a top-ten rating fixture for six of its seven seasons. Arthur&#x27;s performances led to several Emmy nominations over the course of the series and Arthur won an Emmy in 1988. Arthur left the show after the end of the seventh season and the series ended. In 1992, it was retooled as &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; with the other three actresses and aired on CBS as it was not picked up by NBC. The new series, however, lasted only one season.

In 1984, Arthur, who routinely declined commercial endorsements, accepted a lucrative offer from Canadian drugstore chain Shoppers Drug Mart to be their commercial spokeswoman, on the condition that the commercials would not air in the United States. Arthur spent seven years in the position, continuing as spokeswoman during her run on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; by commuting to Toronto for commercial tapings.

===Film===
Arthur reprised her stage role as Vera Charles in the 1974 film adaption of &quot;Mame&quot;, opposite Lucille Ball. She portrayed overbearing mother Bea Vecchio in &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; (1970), and had a cameo as a Roman unemployment clerk in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981). She appeared in the 1995 American movie &quot;For Better or Worse&quot; as Beverly Makeshift. Her final film credit was in &quot;Enemies of Laughter&quot; in 2000, opposite Peter Falk.

===Later career===
After Arthur left &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, she made guest appearances on television shows and organized and toured in her one-woman show, alternately titled &quot;An Evening with Bea Arthur&quot; as well as &quot;And Then There&#x27;s Bea&quot;. She made a guest appearance on the American cartoon &quot;Futurama&quot;, in the Emmy-nominated 2001 episode &quot;Amazon Women in the Mood&quot;, as the voice of the feminist &quot;Femputer&quot; who ruled a race of giant Amazonian women. She appeared in a first-season episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; as Mrs. White, one of Dewey&#x27;s babysitters who was a strict disciplinarian. She was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance. She appeared as Larry David&#x27;s mother on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

In 2002, she returned to Broadway, starring in &quot;Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends&quot;, a collection of stories and songs (with musician Billy Goldenberg) based on her life and career. The show was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event.

In addition to appearing in programs looking back at her own work, Arthur performed in stage and television tributes for Jerry Herman, Bob Hope, Ellen DeGeneres. In 2004, she appeared in Richard Barone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Another Spring: A Tribute to Miss Peggy Lee&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl, performing &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and &quot;The Shining Sea&quot;. In 2005, she participated in the Comedy Central roast of Pamela Anderson, where she recited sexually explicit passages from Anderson&#x27;s book &quot;Star Struck&quot; in a deadpan fashion.

== Influences ==
In 1999, Arthur told an interviewer of the three influences in her career: &quot;Sid Caesar taught me the outrageous; [method acting guru] Lee Strasberg taught me what I call reality; and [original &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; star] Lotte Lenya, whom I adored, taught me economy.&quot; Another source of influence to Arthur was that of famed actress/director Ida Lupino, whom Arthur praised: &quot;My dream was to become a very small blonde movie star like Ida Lupino and those other women I saw up there on the screen during the Depression.&quot;

==Personal life==

Arthur was married twice. Her first marriage took place in 1944, during her time in the military when she wed fellow Marine Robert Alan Aurthur, later a screenwriter, television, and film producer and director. They divorced three years later, but she kept his surname, with the spelling adjusted to &quot;Arthur&quot;. Shortly after they divorced in 1950, she married director Gene Saks with whom she adopted two sons, Matthew, an actor, and Daniel, a set designer. She and Saks remained married until 1978.

In 1972, she moved to Los Angeles and sublet her apartment on Central Park West in New York City and her country home in Bedford, New York. In a 2003 interview, while in London promoting her one-woman show, she described the English capital as her &quot;favorite city in the world&quot;.

Arthur was a longtime champion of equal rights for women and an active advocate of the elderly and Jewish communities in both her major television roles and through her charity work and personal outspokenness. Contrary to the character she played as Maude, she was originally skeptical of the women&#x27;s rights movement. Following her divorce from Gene Saks, she later adopted the language of that movement.

Considered a longtime gay icon, she embraced the gay community that had supported her since the 1970s. Late in life, Arthur took up the cause of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness. She raised $40,000 for the Ali Forney Center with one of her final live performances, a revival of her one-woman Broadway show in 2005 after she had fallen ill with cancer. She would go on to advocate for the center until her death, telling
&quot;Next Magazine&quot;, &quot;These kids at the Ali Forney Center are literally dumped by their families because they are lesbian, gay or transgender — this organization really is saving lives.&quot;

Arthur was a private and introverted woman according to her friends. She was a particularly close mentor and friend to Adrienne Barbeau, who co-starred with her on &quot;Maude&quot; for six seasons. Barbeau was unavailable to perform regularly on the sitcom during its last season due to her schedule; nevertheless, the two remained close and stayed in touch for the rest of Arthur&#x27;s life. In a 2018 interview with the American website Dread Central, Barbeau shared some of her feelings about her friend:

==Death and legacy==
Arthur died of lung cancer at her home in Los Angeles on April 25, 2009, aged 86.

On April 28, 2009, the Broadway community paid tribute to Arthur by dimming the marquees of New York City&#x27;s Broadway theater district in her memory for one minute at 8:00 p.m. On September 16, 2009, a public tribute to Arthur was held at the Majestic Theatre in Manhattan, where friends and colleagues including Angela Lansbury, Norman Lear, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and Rue McClanahan paid tribute to the actress.

Arthur&#x27;s surviving co-stars from &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, McClanahan and White, commented on her death via telephone on an April 27 episode of &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. On the &quot;Today Show&quot; by phone, McClanahan said she and Arthur got along together &quot;like cream.&quot; White said &quot;I knew it would hurt, I just didn&#x27;t know it would hurt this much.&quot;

Longtime friends Adrienne Barbeau (with whom she had worked on &quot;Maude&quot;) and Angela Lansbury (with whom she had worked in &quot;Mame&quot;) reflected on her death. Barbeau said, &quot;We&#x27;ve lost a unique, incredible talent. No one could deliver a line or hold a take like Bea and no one was more generous or giving to her fellow performers.&quot; Lansbury said, &quot;She became and has remained my bosom buddy [...] I am deeply saddened by her passing, but also relieved that she is released from the pain.&quot;

Arthur bequeathed $300,000 to the Ali Forney Center, a New York City organization that provides housing for homeless LGBTQ+ youths. The center was heavily damaged in October 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, but has since been restored and re-opened. The Bea Arthur Residence, which opened in 2017, is an 18-bed residence in Manhattan for homeless LGBT youth operated by the Ali Forney Center.

==Awards==
An Emmy and Tony Award winner, Arthur was an Academy Award away from achieving the Triple Crown of Acting status.

Arthur won the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Tony Award in 1966 as Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance that year as Vera Charles in the original Broadway production of Jerry Herman&#x27;s musical &quot;Mame&quot;.

Arthur received the third most nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series with nine; only Julia Louis-Dreyfus (11) and Mary Tyler Moore (10) have more. She received the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series twice, once in 1977 for &quot;Maude&quot; and again in 1988 for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. She also received the third most nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy with eight, only Carol Burnett (12) and Candice Bergen (9) have more; Arthur tied with Debra Messing as actress with most nominations without ever winning.

Arthur was inducted into the academy&#x27;s Television Hall of Fame in 2008.

On June 8, 2008, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; was awarded the Pop Culture award at the Sixth Annual TV Land Awards. Arthur (in one of her final public appearances) accepted the award with McClanahan and White.

<doc id="217203" wikidata="Q55043" url="?curid=217203" title="Gymnasium (school)">
<text>Gymnasium (and variations of the word; ) is a term in various European languages for a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university. It is comparable to the US English term &quot;preparatory high school&quot; or the British term &quot;grammar school&quot;. Before the 20th century, the gymnasium system was a widespread feature of educational systems throughout many European countries.

The word (), from Greek () &#x27;naked&#x27; or &#x27;nude&#x27;, was first used in Ancient Greece, in the sense of a place for both physical and intellectual education of young men. The latter meaning of a place of intellectual education persisted in many European languages (including Albanian, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Greek, German, Hungarian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Polish, Russian, Scandinavian languages, Croatian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian and Ukrainian), whereas in other languages, like English (&quot;gymnasium&quot;, &quot;gym&quot;) and Spanish (&quot;gimnasio&quot;), the former meaning of a place for physical education was retained.

==School structure==
Because gymnasia prepare students for university study, they are thus meant for the more academically minded students, who are sifted out between the ages of 10 and 13. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a &quot;gymnasium&quot; often study Latin and Ancient Greek.

Some gymnasia provide general education, while others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:
*humanities (specializing in classical languages, such as Latin and Greek)
*modern languages (students are required to study at least three languages)
*mathematics and physical sciences
*economics and other social sciences (students are required to study economics, world history, social studies or business informatics)

Curricula differ from school to school but generally include literature, mathematics, informatics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, art (as well as crafts and design), music, history, philosophy, civics/citizenship, social sciences, and several foreign languages.

Schools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but also on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the German constitution guarantees the separation of church and state, so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.

Today, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as gymnasia specializing in economics, technology or domestic sciences. In some countries, there is a notion of , which is equivalent to beginning classes of the full gymnasium, with the rights to continue education in a &quot;gymnasium&quot;. Here, the prefix &quot;pro&quot;- is equivalent to &quot;pre&quot;-, indicating that this curriculum precedes normal gymnasium studies.

==History==
In Central European, Nordic, Benelux and Baltic countries, this meaning for &quot;gymnasium&quot; (that is a secondary school preparing the student for higher education at a university) has been the same at least since the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The term was derived from the classical Greek word (), which was originally applied to an exercising ground in ancient Athens. Here teachers gathered and gave instruction between the hours devoted to physical exercises and sports, and thus the term became associated with and came to mean an institution of learning.

This use of the term did not prevail among the Romans, but was revived during the Renaissance in Italy, and from there passed into the Netherlands and Germany during the 15th century. In 1538, Johannes Sturm founded at Strasbourg the school which became the model of the modern German gymnasium. In 1812, a Prussian regulation ordered all schools with the right to send their students to the university to bear the name of gymnasium. By the 20th century, this practice was followed in almost the entire Austrian-Hungarian, German, and Russian Empires. In the modern era, many countries which have gymnasia were once part of these three empires.

==By country==
===Albania===
In Albania, a gymnasium () education takes three years following a compulsory nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called . The final test is standardized at the state level and serves as an entrance qualification for universities.

These can be either public (state-run, tuition-free) or private (fee-paying). The subjects taught are mathematics, Albanian language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, computer science, the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education, and the social sciences (sociology, ethics, psychology, politics and economy).

The gymnasium is generally viewed as a destination for the best-performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university. While in European countries a gymnasium tend to be the highest level of high school, in Albania a gymnasium is used to describe high school as a general category. Three quarters of Albanian high school students attent a gymnasium, while just a quarter attent vocational schools.

===Austria===
In Austria the has two stages, from the age of 11 to 14, and from 15 to 18, concluding with Matura. Historically, three types existed. The focuses on Ancient Greek and Latin. The puts its focus on actively spoken languages. The usual combination is English, French, and Latin; sometimes French can be swapped with another foreign language (like Italian, Spanish or Russian). The emphasizes the sciences. In the last few decades, more autonomy has been granted to schools, and various types have been developed, focusing on sports, music, or economics, for example.

===Belarus===
In Belarus, gymnasium is the highest variant of secondary education, which provides advanced knowledge in various subjects. 
The number of years of instruction at a gymnasium is 11. However, it is possible to cover all required credits in 11 years, by taking additional subjects each semester.
In Belarus, gymnasium is generally viewed as a destination for the best-performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, (also spelled &quot;gymnasium&quot;) is a type of school that provides secondary education. Secondary schools, including , lead to the exam.
There are different types of distinguished by the length of study. In the Czech Republic there are eight-year, six-year, and four-year types, and in Slovakia there are eight-year and four-year types, of which the latter is more common. In both countries, there are also bilingual (Czech or Slovak with English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, or Russian; in Slovakia, bilingual are five-year) and private .

===Germany===

German gymnasia are selective schools. They offer the most academically promising youngsters a quality education that is free in all state-run schools (and generally not above €50/month cost in Church-run schools, though there are some expensive private schools). Gymnasia may expel students who academically under-perform their classmates or behave in a way that is often seen as undesirable and unacceptable.

Historically, the German also included in its overall accelerated curriculum post-secondary education at college level and the degree awarded substituted for the bachelor&#x27;s degree (Baccalaureate) previously awarded by a college or university so that universities in Germany became exclusively graduate schools. In the United States, the German Gymnasium curriculum was used at a number of prestigious universities, such as the University of Michigan, as a model for their undergraduate college programs.

Pupils study subjects such as German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, arts, music, physical education, religion, history and civics/citizenship/social sciences and computer science. They are also required to study at least two foreign languages. The usual combinations are English and French or English and Latin, although many schools make it possible to combine English with another language, most often Spanish, Ancient Greek, or Russian. Religious education classes are a part of the curricula of all German schools, yet not compulsory; a student or their parents or guardians can conscientiously object to taking them, in which case the student (along with those whose religion is not being taught in the school) is taught ethics or philosophy. In-state schools, a student who is not baptized into either the Catholic or Protestant faiths is allowed to choose which of these classes to take. The only exception to this is in the state of Berlin, where the subject ethics is mandatory for all students and (Christian) religious studies can only be chosen additionally. A similar situation is found in Brandenburg where the subject life skills, ethics, and religious education () is the primary subject but parents/guardians or students older than 13 can choose to replace it with (Christian) religious studies or take both. The intention behind LER is that students should get an objective insight on questions of personal development and ethics as well as on the major world religions.

For younger students nearly the entire curriculum of a gymnasium is compulsory; in higher years additional subjects are available and some of the hitherto compulsory subjects can be dropped, but the choice is not as wide as in other school systems, such as US high schools.

Although some specialist gymnasia have English or French as the language of instruction, at most gymnasia lessons (apart from foreign language courses) are conducted in Standard German.

The number of years of instruction at a gymnasium differs between the states. It varies between six and seven years in Berlin and Brandenburg (primary school is six years in both as opposed to four years in the rest of Germany) and eight in Bavaria, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg among others. While in Saxony and Thuringia students have never been taught more than eight years in Gymnasium (by default), nearly all states now conduct the examinations, which complete the Gymnasium education, after 13 years of primary school and Gymnasium combined. In addition, some states offer a 12-year curriculum leading to the &quot;&quot;. These final examinations are now centrally drafted and controlled () in all German states except for Rhineland-Palatinate and provide a qualification to attend any German university.

===Italy===

In Italy originally the indicated a type of five-year junior high school (age 11 to 16) and preparing to the three year Classical Lyceum (age 16 to 19), a high school focusing on classical studies and humanities. After the school reform that unified the junior high school system, the term stayed to indicate the first two year of , now five years long. An Italian high school student who enrolls in follows this study path: (gymnasium fourth year, age 14), (gymnasium fifth year, age 15), (lyceum first year, age 16), (lyceum second year, age 17) and (lyceum third year, age 18). Some believe this still has some sense, since the two-year has a differently oriented curriculum from the . students spend the majority of their schooling studying Greek and Latin grammar, laying the bases for the &quot;higher&quot; and more in depth set of studies of the , such as Greek and Latin literature and philosophy.

In July 1940 the fascist Minister of National Education Giuseppe Bottai got a bill of law approved that abolished the first three years of the gymnasium and instituted a unique path of studies for children aged from 12 to 14. The last two years of the gymnasium kept the previous denomination and the related scholastic curriculum for the following decades.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, gymnasium is the highest variant of secondary education, offering the academically most promising youngsters (top 5%) a quality education that is in most cases free (and in other cases at low cost). It consists of six years, after eight years (including kindergarten) of primary school, in which pupils study the same subjects as their German counterparts, with the addition of compulsory Ancient Greek, Latin and (Classical Cultural Education), history of the Ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. Schools have some freedom in choosing their specific curriculum, with for example Spanish, Philosophy and , a very technical and highly demanding course, being available as final exams. Usually, schools will have all classes mandatory in switching combinations for the first three or so years (with the exception of which is a free choice from the second year onward), after which students will choose their subjects in the directions of Economics and Society, Culture and Society, Nature and Health, Nature and Technology or Technology. The equivalent without classical languages is called , and gives access to the same university studies (although some extra classes are needed when starting a degree in classical languages or theology). All are government-funded. See (in English) for the full article on Dutch &quot;preparatory scientific education&quot;.

===Nordic and Baltic countries===

In Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden, gymnasium consists of three years, usually starting at the year the students turn 16 years old after nine or ten years of primary school. In Lithuania, the gymnasium usually consists of four years of schooling starting at the age of 15–16, the last year roughly corresponding to the first year of college.

Most gymnasia in the Nordic countries are free. Universal student grants are also available in certain countries for students over 18.

In Denmark (see also Gymnasium (Denmark)), there are four kinds of gymnasia: STX (Regular Examination Programme), HHX (Higher Business Examination Programme), HTX (Higher Technical Examination Programme) and HF (Higher Preparatory Examination Programme). HF is only two years, instead of the three required for STX, HHX, and HTX. All different types of gymnasia (except for HF) theoretically gives the same eligibility for university. However, because of the different subjects offered, students may be better qualified in an area of further study. E.g. HHX students have subjects that make them more eligible for studies such as business studies or economics at university, while HTX offer applied science and mathematics that benefit studies in Science or Engineering. There is also EUX, which takes four to five years and ends with both the HTX (or HHX for EUX-business) exam and status as a journeyman of a craft. Compared to the somewhat equivalent A-levels in the UK, Danish gymnasia have more mandatory subjects. The subjects are divided into levels, where A-levels usually run through all three years, B-levels usually two years and C-levels one year (apart from PE which exists as a C-level lasting tree years).

In Sweden, there are two different kinds of branches of studies: the first branch focuses on giving a vocational education while the second branch focuses on giving preparation for higher education. While students from both branches can go on to study at a university, students of the vocational branch graduate with a degree within their attended program. There are 18 national programs, 12 vocational and 6 preparatory.

In the Faroe Islands, there are also four kinds of gymnasia, which are the equivalents of the Danish programmes: (equivalent to STX), (HHX), (HTX) and &quot;HF&quot; (HF). and HF are usually located at the same institutions as can be seen in the name of the institute in Eysturoy: Studentaskúlin og HF-skeiðið í Eysturoy.

In Greenland, there is a single kind of gymnasium, Den Gymnasiale Uddannelse (Ilinniarnertuunngorniarneq), that replaced the earlier Greenlandic Secondary Education Programme (GU), the Greenland Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) and the Greenland education to Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX), which were based on the Danish system. This program allows a more flexible Greenland gymnasium, where students based on a common foundation course can choose between different fields of study that meet the individual student&#x27;s abilities and interests. The course is offered in Aasiaat, Nuuk, Sisimiut and Qaqortoq, with one in Ilulissat to be opened in 2015, latest in 2016 if approved by .

In Finland, the admissions to gymnasia are competitive, the accepted people comprising 51% of the age group. The gymnasia concludes with the matriculation examination, an exam whose grades are the main criteria for university admissions.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, gymnasia (, ) are selective schools that provide a three- to six-year (depending on the canton) course of advanced secondary education intended to prepare students to attend university. They conclude with a nationally standardized exam, the or , often shortened to &quot;Matura or &quot;Matur&quot;&quot;, which if passed allows students to attend a Swiss university. The gymnasia are operated by the cantons of Switzerland, and accordingly in many cantons they are called (cantonal school).

===Former Yugoslav countries===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia, a gymnasium education takes four years following a compulsory eight or nine-year elementary education and ending with a final aptitude test called &quot;Matura&quot;. In these countries, the final test is standardized at the state level and can serve as an entrance qualification for universities.

There are either public (state-run and tuition-free), religious (church-run with secular curriculum and tuition-free) or private (fee-paying) gymnasium schools in these countries.

The subjects taught are mathematics, the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics (computers), the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education, and the social sciences (sociology, ethics or religious education, psychology, politics, and economy). Religious studies are optional. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and North Macedonia, Latin is also a mandatory subject in all gymnasia, just as Ancient Greek is, with Latin, in a certain type of gymnasia called Classical Gymnasia ().

In all of the countries, the gymnasium (/) is generally viewed as a destination for best-performing students and as the type of school that serves primarily to prepare students for university studies, while other students go to technical/vocational schools. Therefore, gymnasia often base their admittance criteria on an entrance exam, elementary school grades, or a combination of the two.

**Imperial Russia: since 1726, eight years since 1871. Women&#x27;s gymnasia since 1862; 7 years plus an optional 8th for specialisation in pedagogy. Progymnasia: equivalent to 4 first years of gymnasium.
**Russian Federation: full 11 or 6–7 years after primary school. There are very few classical gymnasia in modern Russia. The notable exception is the St Petersburg Classical Gymnasium where Latin, Ancient Greek, and mathematics are the three core subjects. In the majority of other cases, Russian Gymnasia are schools specialised in a certain subject (or several subjects) in the humanities (e.g. Chelyabinsk School No. 1).
*: 4 years, starting at age 14/15 after eight years in elementary/primary school. There are three most common types of gymnasia: 1) general gymnasium () which offers broad education in all sciences; 2) natural sciences (); and 3) social studies (), available all over Serbia, and a few specialised ones, e.g. mathematics ()—only one in all of Serbia, in Belgrade; sports ()—just two in Serbia; language ()—a total of four in Serbia; and military gymnasium ()—only one in all of Serbia. In the end, all students take a final exam—a Matura. Completion of the Gymnasium is a prerequisite for enrollment into a university. English and another foreign language (from the selection of German, French, Russian (most common languages), Italian or Spanish (far less common) or Chinese and Japanese (only philological gymnasia have these two) in addition to the mother tongue, and in case of minorities also Serbian) are compulsory throughout.
*: 4 years starting at age 15/16 after completing nine years of elementary school (more common); eight years starting at age 11/12 after completing 5 years of elementary school; both end with Maturita.
*: 4 years, starting at age 14/15; ends with Matura.
*: Paul Roos Gymnasium is a well-known gymnasium for boys in the town of Stellenbosch. The school is a boarding school, based on the classic British boarding schools; however, it was more influenced by the Protestant faith, hence the German Gymnasium. Foreign languages such as French, German, Mandarin, and Latin are studied; Afrikaans and English are compulsory. School in South Africa: 5 years, starting at age 13/14, at a secondary institution, after 7 years of primary school, ends with Matric.
*: Upper secondary school in Sweden lasts for three years (formerly four years on some programmes). &quot;Gymnasium&quot; is the word used to describe this stage of the education system in Sweden. The National Agency for Education has decided that &quot;gymnasium&quot; is equivalent to the international upper secondary school. The gymnasium is optional and follows after nine years in elementary school. However, the Swedish term (&quot;high school&quot;) may cause some confusion. In Swedish it is used almost synonymously with &quot;university,&quot; with the only difference being that universities have the right to issue doctoral examinations. In the case of technical universities, these could also be called even when they have right to issue doctoral examinations (e.g., , officially named a &quot;Technical University&quot; in English; , Faculty of Engineering, Lund University; and Kungliga tekniska högskolan, Royal Institute of Technology&quot;). A is often located in cities with lower population, except for the technical ones that can be found also in the largest cities. 
*: usually 4 years after nine years of compulsory schooling (primary and secondary I); it is also possible to attend a so-called which lasts 6 years, following a six-year primary schooling; the Gymnasium ends with Matura at the age of 18/19.
*: eight years, starting after four years of primary school.
*: historically, grammar schools have been the English equivalent of the gymnasium, selecting pupils on the basis of academic ability (usually through the 11+ entrance examination in year 6, at the age of 10 or 11) and educating them with the assumption that they would go on to study at a university; such schools were largely phased out from 1965 under the Wilson and Heath governments, and less than 5% of pupils now attend the remaining 146 grammar schools. The UK therefore no longer has a widespread equivalent of the gymnasium. The exception is Northern Ireland and some parts of England within the counties of Buckinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Kent, which have retained the system. Grammar schools are also to be found in some London boroughs, North Yorkshire, Essex, Lancashire, Warwickshire, and Devon in varying degrees. Many private, fee-paying private schools, including all those commonly referred to as &quot;public&quot; schools, seek to fulfill a similar role to the state grammar school if the scholar has the ability (and thus to the gymnasium in other countries) and, most importantly, the money to attend them.
*
**Public school: As school districts continue to experiment with educational styles, the magnet school has become a popular type of high school. Boston Latin School and Central High School in Philadelphia are the two oldest public schools in the country and the oldest magnet schools. As the concept has not become entrenched in the various American educational systems, due partly to the federal—rather than unitary—style of education in the United States, the term may vary among states.
**Private school: The equivalent among private schools is the preparatory school.

==Final degree==
Depending on country, the final degree (if any) is called Abitur, Artium, Diploma, Matura, Maturita or Student and it usually opens the way to professional schools directly. However, these degrees are occasionally not fully accredited internationally, so students wanting to attend a foreign university often have to submit to further exams to be permitted access to them.

==Relationship with other education facilities==
In countries like Austria, most university faculties accept only students from secondary schools that last four years (rather than three). This includes all Gymnasium students but only a part of vocational high schools, in effect making Gymnasium the preferred choice for all pupils aiming for university diplomas.

In Germany, other types of secondary school are called , and . These are attended by about two thirds of the students and the first two are practically unknown in other parts of the world. A largely corresponds to a British or American comprehensive school. However, it offers the same school-leaving certificates as the other three types—the (school-leaving certificate of a after 9th grade or in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia after 10th grade), the (also called , school-leaving certificate of a after 10th Grade) and (also called , school-leaving certificate after 12th Grade). Students who graduate from or may continue their schooling at a vocational school until they have full job qualifications. It is also possible to get an after 10th grade that allows the students to continue their education at the of a &quot;gymnasium&quot; and get an . There are two types of vocational school in Germany: the , a part-time vocational school and a part of Germany&#x27;s dual education system, and the , a full-time vocational school outside the dual education system. Students who graduate from a vocational school and students who graduate with a good grade point average from a can continue their schooling at another type of German secondary school, the &quot;Fachoberschule&quot;, a vocational high school. The school leaving exam of this type of school, the , enables the graduate to start studying at a (polytechnic) and in Hesse also at a university within the state. Students who have graduated from vocational school and have been working in a job for at least three years can go to Berufsoberschule to get either a (meaning they may go to university, but they can only study the subjects belonging to the &quot;branch&quot; (economical, technical, social) they studied in at ) after one year, or the normal (after two years), which gives them complete access to universities.

<text>Scrubs (stylized as [scrubs]) is an American medical sitcom created by Bill Lawrence that aired from October 2, 2001, to March 17, 2010, on NBC and later ABC. The series follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital, which is a teaching hospital. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters are medical interns.

The series was noted for its fast-paced slapstick and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, John &quot;J.D.&quot; Dorian, played by Zach Braff. The main cast for all but its last season consisted of Braff, Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley, and Judy Reyes. The series featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, Michael J. Fox and Colin Farrell.

Although season eight&#x27;s &quot;My Finale&quot; was conceived and filmed as a series finale, the show was eventually revived for a ninth season subtitled &quot;Med School&quot;, with the setting moved to a medical school and new cast members introduced. Of the original cast only Braff, Faison, and McGinley remained regular cast members, while others (except Reyes) made guest appearances; Kerry Bishé, Eliza Coupe, Dave Franco, and Michael Mosley became series regulars, with Bishé becoming the show&#x27;s new narrator.

&quot;Scrubs&quot;, produced by ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television), premiered on October 2, 2001, on NBC. The series received a Peabody Award in 2006. During the seventh season, NBC announced that it would not renew the show; ABC announced it had picked up the eighth season of the series, intended to be the final season, which began airing on January 6, 2009. A ninth season, subtitled &quot;Med School&quot;, premiered on December 1, 2009, and on May 14, 2010, ABC officially canceled the series.

==Overview==
&quot;Scrubs&quot; focuses on the unique point of view of its main character and narrator, Dr. John Michael &quot;J.D.&quot; Dorian (Zach Braff) for the first eight seasons, with season nine being narrated by the new main character Lucy Bennett (Kerry Bishé). Most episodes feature multiple story lines thematically linked by voice-overs done by Braff, as well as the comical daydreams of J.D. According to Bill Lawrence, &quot;What we decided was, rather than have it be a monotone narration, if it&#x27;s going to be Zach&#x27;s voice, we&#x27;re going to do everything through J.D.&#x27;s eyes. It opened up a visual medium that those of us as comedy writers were not used to.&quot; Actors were given the chance to improvise their lines on set with encouragement by series creator Bill Lawrence, with Neil Flynn and Zach Braff being the main improvisors.

Almost every episode title for the first eight seasons begins with the word &quot;My&quot;. Bill Lawrence says this is because each episode is Dr. John Dorian writing in his diary (revealed in the commentary on the DVD of the first-season episode &quot;My Hero&quot;). A few episodes are told from another character&#x27;s perspective and have episode titles such as &quot;His Story&quot; or &quot;Her Story&quot;. Apart from a brief period of narration from J.D. at the beginning and the end, these episodes primarily contain internal narration from other characters besides J.D. The transfer of the narration duties usually occurs at a moment of physical contact between two characters. Starting with season nine, the episode titles start with &quot;Our...&quot; as the focus has shifted from the perspective of J.D. to a new group of medical students. The webisodes that accompanied season eight, &quot;&quot;, also were named &quot;Our...&quot;.

==Cast and characters==
For the first eight seasons, the series featured seven main cast members, with numerous other characters recurring throughout the course of the series. Starting with the ninth season, many of the original cast left as regular characters, while four new additions were made to the main cast.
* Zach Braff portrays John Michael &quot;J.D.&quot; Dorian, the show&#x27;s protagonist and narrator. J.D. is a young physician, who begins the series as an intern. His voice-over to the series comes from his internal thoughts and often features surreal fantasies. J.D. describes himself as a &quot;sensi&quot;, short for &quot;sensitive guy&quot;, enjoying acoustic alternative music and being a lover of hugs. Over the course of the series, J.D. rises through the ranks of the hospital before leaving Sacred Heart to become the Residency Director at St. Vincent Hospital, before briefly returning to become a teacher at Winston University. J.D. has a son with ex-girlfriend Kim Briggs and a child with wife Elliot Reid.
* Sarah Chalke portrays Elliot Reid (seasons 1–8, recurring season 9), another intern and later private-practice physician. Her relationship with J.D. becomes romantic on several occasions throughout the series, resulting in them eventually marrying and having a child together. As the series progresses, despite an initial dislike of each other, she becomes friends with Carla. Elliot is driven by a neurotic desire to prove her worth to her family (in which all of the males are doctors), her peers, and herself. She is described as extremely book-smart and equally attractive, while her social abilities are somewhat lacking. Her social skills develop throughout the seasons.
* Donald Faison portrays Christopher Turk, J.D.&#x27;s best friend and surgeon, who rises from intern to chief of surgery as the series progresses. Turk and J.D. were roommates when they attended the College of William and Mary, as well as in medical school, and the two have an extremely close relationship. Turk is highly driven and competitive while always remaining loyal. During the course of the series, Turk forms a relationship with Carla; they start dating early in the series, then get married, and eventually start a family together, having two children. In season nine, he is a teacher at Winston University while continuing his duties as chief of surgery.
* Neil Flynn portrays the &quot;Janitor&quot; (recurring season 1, main cast seasons 2–8, guest star season 9), the hospital&#x27;s custodian. An incident in the pilot episode establishes an antagonistic relationship between J.D. and him, which persists throughout the series. This tends to take the form of the Janitor pulling abusive pranks on J.D., although he has shown, several times throughout the series, that he has a good side. The Janitor&#x27;s real name is not mentioned until the season eight finale when he reveals to J.D. that he is called &quot;Glenn Matthews&quot;. Shortly after this revelation, he is addressed as and answers to &quot;Tommy&quot; by another member of the hospital staff, bringing his previously stated name into question. However, it was later confirmed in a Facebook video by creator Bill Lawrence that the former is indeed his true name. 
* Ken Jenkins portrays Bob Kelso (seasons 1–8, recurring season 9), Sacred Heart&#x27;s chief of medicine for the first seven seasons, after which he retires; in season nine, he becomes a teacher at Winston University. While chief of medicine, Kelso is seen to be selfish, intimidating, and mean-spirited, driven primarily by the hospital&#x27;s bottom line rather than the well-being of patients. It is occasionally suggested that he has a softer side, and that his meanness is a means of coping with the years of hard decisions. After his retirement in season seven, his relationship with staff at the hospital improves, becoming a regular at the hospital&#x27;s coffee shop where he is entitled to &quot;free muffins for life&quot;. He is married with a son and regularly comments on the poor state of his marriage and the activities of his homosexual son. In season nine, after the death of his wife, Kelso becomes a teacher at Winston University along with J.D., Cox, and Turk.
* John C. McGinley portrays Perry Cox, an attending physician who becomes the chief of medicine at Sacred Heart in season eight. J.D. considers Cox his mentor, despite the fact that Cox routinely criticizes him, patronizes him, and calls him female names. Cox frequently suggests that this cruel treatment is intended as conditioning for the rigors of hospital life. On rare occasions, he expresses grudging admiration and even pride at J.D.&#x27;s accomplishments. Dr. Cox is dedicated to the welfare of his patients and frequently expresses concern for them, leading to frequent arguments with Bob Kelso. In season nine, he is seen working as a professor at Winston University while continuing his duties as chief of medicine.
* Judy Reyes portrays Carla Espinosa (seasons 1–8), the hospital&#x27;s head nurse. Carla is opinionated, stubborn, and domineering, but continually caring, acting as a mother figure to interns, supporting them and sticking up for them when they make mistakes. During the course of the series, Turk forms a relationship with Carla; they start dating in the first episode of the series, then get married, and eventually start a family together. She is very close to J.D., affectionately calling him &quot;Bambi&quot;, and despite initially disliking each other, also becomes close friends with Elliot.
* Eliza Coupe portrays Denise &quot;Jo&quot; Mahoney (recurring season 8, regular season 9), an intern at Sacred Heart Hospital in season eight. She is outspoken and brutally honest, and struggles with patient-doctor communications because of this. In season nine, she is a resident at the new Sacred Heart Hospital, as well as a student adviser and teacher&#x27;s assistant at Winston University. She is romantically involved with medical student Drew Suffin.
* Kerry Bishé portrays Lucy Bennett (season 9), a medical student at Winston University. She is the protagonist of season nine, initially sharing the narrating duties of the show with J.D. before taking over completely. She, like J.D., also has surreal fantasies. She loves horses and is romantically involved with a fellow student, Cole Aaronson.
* Michael Mosley portrays Drew Suffin (season 9), a medical student at Winston University. Though few details are ever given, Drew&#x27;s dark past is often alluded to, including a previous burn-out at medical school. He is in a relationship with Denise Mahoney.
* Dave Franco portrays Cole Aaronson (season 9), an arrogant medical student at Winston University whose family donated a large amount of money to get the new Sacred Heart Hospital built and as such, believes that he is untouchable. After being diagnosed with skin cancer and subsequently going into remission after successful surgery, Cole rethinks his life and decides to specialize in surgery. He is in a relationship with Lucy Bennett.

==Episodes==
The first season introduces John Michael &quot;J.D.&quot; Dorian and his best friend Christopher Turk in their first year out of medical school as interns at Sacred Heart Hospital. J.D. meets his reluctant mentor Perry Cox; an attractive female intern named Elliot, on whom he develops a crush; the hospital&#x27;s janitor, who goes out of his way to make J.D.&#x27;s life difficult; Chief of Medicine Dr. Bob Kelso, who is more concerned about the budget than the patients; and Carla Espinosa, the head nurse who eventually becomes Turk&#x27;s girlfriend. The characters face romance and relationship issues, family obligations, overwhelming paperwork, long shifts, dealing with death of patients, and conflicting pressures from senior doctors.

The second season follows J.D.&#x27;s second year practicing medicine at Sacred Heart where Elliot, Turk, and he are now residents. As the season develops, money issues affect the three of them, especially Elliot, whose dad cut her off. J.D.&#x27;s older brother Dan (Tom Cavanagh) comes to visit, as does Turk&#x27;s brother Kevin (D.L. Hughley). Season two focuses on the romantic relationships of the main characters: Turk proposes to an indecisive Carla, who has doubts about if Turk is mature enough; Elliot dates nurse Paul Flowers (Rick Schroder); and Dr. Cox dates pharmaceutical rep Julie (Heather Locklear) before reigniting a relationship with his pregnant ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller). J.D., meanwhile, attempts a relationship with Elliot, and later falls for Jamie (Amy Smart), the wife of one of his coma patients.

As the third season opens, Elliot decides to change her image with some help from the Janitor. J.D.&#x27;s undeniable crush on Elliot emerges again, but J.D. instead begins a relationship with Jordan&#x27;s sister Danni (Tara Reid), who is also dealing with feelings for her ex. Turk and Carla are engaged and planning their wedding. Turk, along with Todd and the other surgical residents, deal with new attending surgeon Grace Miller (Bellamy Young), who dislikes Turk and considers him sexist. Cox and Jordan are doing well with their relationship and their son Jack, although Cox develops a schoolboy crush on Dr. Miller. He also struggles with the death of his best friend, Jordan&#x27;s brother. Elliot gets into a serious relationship with Sean Kelly (Scott Foley) and tries to maintain a long-distance relationship while he is in New Zealand for six months. J.D. eventually convinces Elliot to break up with Sean to date him, only to realize, once he has her, that he does not actually love her. Their relationship lasts three days. The season ends with Turk and Carla&#x27;s wedding, which Turk misses due to surgery and a church mix-up.

In season four, J.D. finishes his residency and becomes a full-blown colleague of Cox, although their dynamic does not change much. As the season opens, Turk arrives from his honeymoon with Carla, but they soon start having issues when Carla tries to change many things about her new husband. Their marriage and Turk&#x27;s friendship with J.D. experience friction when J.D. and Carla share a drunken kiss. Dr. Cox and Jordan learn that their divorce was not final, but this is not necessarily all good news. Elliot is still angry with J.D. for breaking her heart, and the situation becomes more uncomfortable still when she dates J.D.&#x27;s brother. J.D. has a new love interest of his own when a new and very attractive psychiatrist, Dr. Molly Clock (Heather Graham), arrives at Sacred Heart. Molly also serves as Elliot&#x27;s mentor during her time at the hospital.

Season five starts with J.D. living in a hotel, sorting out apartment issues. Elliot is dating Jake who builds her confidence up so she applies for, and gets, a new fellowship in another hospital. Turk and Carla are trying to have a baby, despite Turk&#x27;s still having doubts. Finally, new interns have arrived to Sacred Heart, chief among them being Keith Dudemeister (Travis Schuldt), who soon becomes Elliot&#x27;s new boyfriend, much to J.D.&#x27;s dissatisfaction. J.D. is cast in the role of expecting father, discovering at the very end of the season that his girlfriend, Dr. Kim Briggs (Elizabeth Banks), is pregnant with his child.

The sixth season has J.D. and the other characters mature to fill the different roles required of them. Turk and Carla become parents when Carla gives birth to their daughter Isabella. Elliot plans her wedding to Keith, although J.D. and she still harbor feelings for each other. Dr. Cox, as father of two children with Jordan, struggles to prevent his foul disposition from affecting his parenting.

In season seven, J.D. and Elliot struggle once again to deny their feelings for each other, despite Elliot soon to be marrying Keith and J.D. to have his first son with Kim, while the Janitor may have a new girlfriend. Bob Kelso&#x27;s job is put on the line as he turns 65 years old. J.D.&#x27;s brother Dan also returns to town.

The eighth season has Kelso&#x27;s replacement, Taylor Maddox (Courteney Cox), arrive; she quickly makes a lot of changes, affecting the way doctors treat patients. Elliot and J.D. finally discuss their true feelings for each other and again become a couple. Janitor and Lady (Kit Pongetti) marry, while Cox is promoted to chief of medicine to replace the dismissed Dr. Maddox, with some encouragement from Kelso. Kelso and Dr. Cox become friends, and J.D. prepares to leave Sacred Heart to move closer to his son, with Elliot. Turk is promoted to chief of surgery at Sacred Heart.

Coinciding with season eight, the webisode series &quot;&quot; was launched, focusing around the eighth season&#x27;s medical interns, Sonja &quot;Sunny&quot; Dey (Sonal Shah), Denise (Eliza Coupe), Katie (Betsy Beutler), and Howie (Todd Bosley). The interns learn from various characters of the show about life in the hospital.

The ninth season takes place over a year after season eight&#x27;s finale. The old Sacred Heart hospital has been torn down and rebuilt. Cox, Dorian, and Turk are now Winston University medical school professors whose students occasionally rotate through the new Sacred Heart. Between the end of season eight and the beginning of season nine, the Janitor has left the hospital after being told that J.D. was not returning, and Elliot and J.D. have married and are expecting their first child. J.D.&#x27;s stay at the university is short, and he leaves the series after six episodes, reappearing in episode 9, &quot;Our Stuff Gets Real&quot;, as a secondary character. Kelso&#x27;s wife passes away, and Ted quits Sacred Heart to travel around the U.S. with his girlfriend.

==Production==
The origin for the show is loosely based on Dr. Jonathan Doris&#x27; experiences as a resident in internal medicine at Brown Medical School, which served as inspiration for college friend and show creator Bill Lawrence.

&quot;Scrubs&quot; was produced by ABC, through its production division, though it was aired by rival broadcaster NBC. According to show runner Lawrence, the arrangement was unusual, at least for 2007: &quot;The show is a dinosaur, on one network and completely owned by another&quot; and, since it is now in syndication, making a &quot;ton of money for Touchstone.&quot; Lawrence confirmed ABC would have broadcast the seventh season had NBC refused to do so.

===Main crew===
The show&#x27;s creator, Bill Lawrence, was also an executive producer and the showrunner. He wrote 14 episodes and directed 17. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes during their eight-year run on the show, starting as co-producers on the show and ending as executive producers; they left the show after the eighth season. Mike Schwartz, who also played Lloyd the Delivery Guy, wrote 13 episodes during the first eight seasons; he started out as a story editor and became co-executive producer in season six. Janae Bakken and Debra Fordham were writers and producers during the first eight seasons, each writing 16 episodes. Other notable writers who started in the first season include Mark Stegemann, who wrote 14 episodes and directed two episodes during the first eight seasons; Gabrielle Allan, who wrote 11 episodes during the first four seasons and was co-executive producer; Eric Weinberg, who wrote 11 episodes during the first six seasons and was co-executive producer; Matt Tarses, who wrote eight episodes during the first four seasons and was co-executive producer. Notable writers who joined in the second season include Tim Hobert, who wrote 11 episodes from seasons two to six, and became executive producer in season five. Angela Nissel wrote 10 episodes from seasons two to eight, starting out as a staff writer and became supervising producer in season seven. Bill Callahan joined the show in season four, writing eight episodes from seasons four to eight; he became executive producer in season six.

Adam Bernstein, who directed the pilot episode, &quot;My First Day&quot;, also directed 11 episodes up until season seven. Michael Spiller directed the most episodes, 20 during the entire series run. Ken Whittingham and Chris Koch both directed 12 episodes from seasons two to nine. Comedian Michael McDonald, who also appeared on the show, directed five episodes. Show star Zach Braff directed seven episodes of the show, including the landmark 100th episode &quot;My Way Home&quot;, which won a Peabody Award in April 2007. In 2009, Josh Bycel, a writer and supervising producer for the animated comedy &quot;American Dad!&quot;, joined the crew as a new executive producer for the ninth season.

====Medical advisors====
&quot;Scrubs&quot; writers worked with several medical advisors, including doctors Jonathan Doris, Jon Turk, and Dolly Klock. Their names serve as the basis for the names of characters John Dorian, Chris Turk, and Molly Clock (played by Braff, Faison, and Heather Graham, respectively). In the season eight finale &quot;My Finale&quot;, the &quot;real J.D.&quot;, Jonathan Doris, made a cameo appearance as the doctor who said &quot;adios&quot; to J.D.
In addition, the show creator said that every single medical story on the show was handed to them by real physicians, whose names would then be written into the show. The show never used real patients&#x27; names, but Lawrence and his writers would make sure the doctors&#x27; names were written into the episodes.

===Filming location and Sacred Heart Hospital===

In the show, Sacred Heart is an inner-city teaching hospital located in Greater Sacramento, California. The first eight seasons of &quot;Scrubs&quot; were filmed on location at the North Hollywood Medical Center, a decommissioned hospital located at 12629 Riverside Drive in North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The site is on the south bank of the concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, visible in some scenes on the series.

The production of &quot;Scrubs&quot; took complete control of the hospital, with the existing hospital rooms reworked to be more production-friendly. This involved knocking down various walls to create larger, more open spaces such as the main ward and the communal areas like admissions, which did not originally exist. Production designer Cabot McMullen also introduced more glass walls and windows around the hospital sets, as well as putting in nurses stations, which could be easily moved to allow different camera movements. While much of the building was renovated, the team were very keen to preserve the state of disrepair which the hospital was in, to give the show a more gritty, dank aesthetic.

Other recurring locations were also built into the building, including J.D. and Turk&#x27;s apartment, a bar which they frequent and Dr. Cox&#x27;s apartment–which was built in an old operating room. As well as these permanent locations, the production team would also often construct temporary sets as required, also within the hospital. Almost all of the team responsible for the show were housed within the hospital; this included all of the writers, production and casting team. Post-production was also handled in the building, with an editing suite and a sound-studio for ADR.

Instead of the more traditional artist trailers for the cast to retreat to during breaks, they were instead all given old hospital rooms as well as a small allowance to decorate them. In some instances when either filming went on late, or the cast and crew went out after work, some, such as John C. McGinley would go and sleep in their dressing room at the hospital instead of going home. Cast and crew on the show refer to the location as &quot;San DiFrangeles&quot;—a portmanteau of San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles that is meant to encompass a large part of California. In season four&#x27;s episode nine, &quot;My Malpractice Decision&quot;, Turk&#x27;s new phone number has the Sacramento area code 916. For the ninth season, the show moved to Culver Studios, with exteriors shot on lawns and outside the historical office bungalows of the studio complex. The building used for the exteriors of the new Sacred Heart Hospital is located at the intersection of Ince Boulevard and Lindblade Street in Culver City, California ().

===WGA strike and network change===
On November 5, 2007, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, which put the production of the show&#x27;s seventh season on hold. When the strike started, only 11 of &quot;Scrubs&quot;″ 18 planned seventh-season episodes had been finished. Lawrence refused to cross any WGA picket lines to serve any of his duties for the show, so ABC Studios had non-WGA members finish episode 12, which the studio had unsuccessfully pressured Lawrence to rewrite as a series finale prior to the strike.

During the strike, NBC announced that &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot; would be replaced by &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. NBC later announced that they would leave &quot;Scrubs&quot; on hiatus for the time being and fill the 8–9 pm timeslot with various specials and repeats.

Episode 11, &quot;My Princess&quot;, was eventually filmed, although Lawrence was absent. Filming of episode 11 was disrupted by picketers. It was believed that Lawrence had tipped the picketers off about the filming schedule, although these beliefs turned out to be false as Lawrence quickly drove to the set to &quot;keep the peace&quot;. After the strike ended, Lawrence announced that the final episodes of &quot;Scrubs&quot; would be produced, although at the time, he was unsure where or how they would be distributed.

===Switch to ABC===
Amid strike-induced doubt involving the final episodes of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, on February 28, 2008, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that ABC was in talks with corporate sibling ABC Studios with the aim of bringing &quot;Scrubs&quot; to ABC for an eighth season of 18 episodes, despite Lawrence and Braff&#x27;s protests that the seventh season would definitely be the last. Just hours later, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that NBC was lashing out and threatening legal action against ABC Studios. McGinley confirmed that he had been told to report back to work on March 24, 2008, to begin production for another season. On March 12, 2008, McGinley was also quoted as saying that the show&#x27;s long-rumored move from NBC to ABC was a done deal, and that &quot;Scrubs&quot; would air on ABC during the 2008–09 TV season as a midseason replacement.

On March 19, 2008, Michael Ausiello of &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that although nothing was &quot;official&quot;, the &quot;Scrubs&quot; cast was to report back to work the following Wednesday for work on a season &quot;unofficial&quot; as yet. Zach Braff posted in his blog on Myspace, on April 28, 2008, that an eighth season consisting of 18 episodes was under production, but that he could not say where it would be aired. He then stated, on May 7, 2008, that the May 8 episode would be the final NBC-aired episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, which was followed by a bulletin on his Myspace, on May 12, confirming that &quot;Scrubs&quot;″s eighth season would be moving to ABC.

====Season eight====

On May 13, 2008, ABC announced that &quot;Scrubs&quot; would be a midseason replacement, airing Tuesday nights at 9:00 pm EST. Steve McPherson, ABC&#x27;s President of Entertainment, also stated that additional seasons of &quot;Scrubs&quot; beyond the eighth could be produced if it performs well. In late November, ABC announced &quot;Scrubs&quot; would resume with back-to-back episodes on January 6, 2009, at 9:00 pm EST.

Creator Bill Lawrence described season eight as more like the first few seasons in tone, with increased focus on more realistic storylines, accompanied by the introduction of new characters. Courteney Cox joined the cast as the new chief of medicine, Dr. Maddox, for a three-episode arc. The eighth season includes webisodes and is the first &quot;Scrubs&quot; season broadcast in high definition.

Sarah Chalke was hoping that J.D. and Elliot would end up back together, comparing them to &quot;Friends&quot; characters Ross and Rachel, which has been addressed a few times on the show. In the early episodes of the season, they did rekindle their relationship, and continued dating through the end of the season. Several actors who guest starred as patients at Sacred Heart during the course of &quot;Scrubs&quot; returned for the finale.

The double-length season eight finale, &quot;My Finale&quot;, aired on May 6, 2009, and was expected to be the series finale, as well. However, it soon became clear that the show would return for a ninth season.

====Season nine====

On April 16, 2009, Bill Lawrence wrote on the ABC.com message boards that a ninth season of &quot;Scrubs&quot; was still &quot;50/50&quot;. On April 28, it was announced that ABC was in talks to renew &quot;Scrubs&quot; for another year.

Lawrence also stated that &quot;Scrubs&quot; as it was is over, for the show to move forward with a new cast in an &quot;ER&quot; type role on ABC, or take a new title completely. In response to criticisms that the change would tarnish &quot;Scrubs&quot;″ legacy, Lawrence defended the decision, as it would allow the &quot;Scrubs&quot; crew to continue work through a recession: &quot;&#x27;Legacy shmegacy.&#x27; I&#x27;m really proud of the show, I&#x27;ll continue to be proud of the show, but I love all of those people...&quot;

On June 19, 2009, it was announced that the ninth season of &quot;Scrubs&quot; would &quot;shift from the hospital to the classroom and make med-school professors of John C. McGinley&#x27;s Dr. Cox and Donald Faison&#x27;s Turk.&quot; According to Lawrence, the ninth season would &quot;be a lot like &quot;Paper Chase&quot; as a comedy,&quot; with Cox&#x27;s and Turk&#x27;s students occasionally rotating through the halls of Sacred Heart and encountering former series regulars. McGinley and Faison were joined by &quot;a quartet of newbies (most of them playing students)&quot; as full-time regulars, while one of the freshmen &quot;will be fairly famous.&quot;

Of the seven actors who had appeared in the show since the pilot, only Faison and McGinley retained their roles as regulars. Zach Braff returned part-time and was absent for the majority of the season, while retaining lead billing for six episodes. Sarah Chalke returned for four episodes as a guest star; Ken Jenkins, credited as a guest star, appeared in nine of the 13 episodes; Neil Flynn appeared in the season premiere in a brief cameo; Judy Reyes was the only former star not to return to the show. In an interview on the YouTube series Made Man, John C. McGinley stated that the reason for some cast members not returning was that they demanded higher salaries. Although he did not confirm which cast members, he did specify that two of the original cast made demands; hence, they were not brought back.

The new main cast included Eliza Coupe returning to the recurring role of Denise &quot;Jo&quot; Mahoney from season eight, Dave Franco as Cole, a charming, confidently stupid, and incredibly entitled medical student whose family donated the money to build the school, Kerry Bishé as Lucy, who shared the starring role with Braff in the beginning of the season and eventually became the show&#x27;s new narrator, and Michael Mosley as Drew, a 30-year-old med student on his last attempt at school.

Production for the final season took place at Culver Studios.

===Cancellation===
On May 14, 2010, it was officially announced that the show was canceled. The season nine finale, titled &quot;Our Thanks&quot;, aired on March 17, 2010. Five days later, on March 22, 2010, Zach Braff announced, via the official Facebook page, that the ninth season of &quot;Scrubs&quot; would be the last, commenting that, &quot;Many of you have asked, so here it is: it appears that &#x27;New Scrubs&#x27;, &#x27;Scrubs 2.0&#x27;, &#x27;Scrubs with New Kids&#x27;, &#x27;Scrubbier&#x27;, &#x27;Scrubs without JD&#x27; is no more. It was worth a try, but alas... it didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

===Crossovers===
Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, John C. McGinley and Neil Flynn reprised their roles as J.D., Elliot Reid, Carla Espinosa, Perry Cox, and the Janitor to make a cameo appearance in the 2002 Muppets film &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;, trying to reanimate Miss Piggy. Eventually, Piggy and the &quot;Scrubs&quot; cast break the fourth wall, with the actors portraying themselves and Bill Lawrence appearing as himself/the director of the current episode.

Neil Flynn reprised his role as Janitor in the &quot;Clone High&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Litter Kills: Litterally&quot;. In the episode, Janitor is revealed to work part-time at Clone High, where his adoptive son, a clone of Ponce De León, attends high school until he is killed, and Janitor is fired by Principal Scudworth. In a speech at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia on January 29, 2009, Bill Lawrence confirmed that the name Scudworth called Janitor in the episode, &quot;Glenn&quot;, was in the fact the character&#x27;s real name, with his full name confirmed as &quot;Glenn Matthews&quot; in the season 8 finale of &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In the season 2 finale of the 2023 revival of &quot;Clone High&quot;, Flynn reprised his role as Janitor for the first time since the &quot;Scrubs&quot; season 9 premiere &quot;Our First Day of School&quot;; revealed to have been since rehired in his old position as Janitor of Clone High, Janitor signs Joan of Arc&#x27;s Clone High 2023 yearbook, telling her (and signing) that &quot;You&#x27;re a lone wolf, just like me! – Janitor&quot;, before howling and walking away.

Sam Lloyd reprised his role as Ted Buckland in the season two finale of the Lawrence series &quot;Cougar Town&quot;. In the episode, written and directed by Lawrence, Ted is in Hawaii and says his girlfriend, Stephanie Gooch, has run off with Dr. Hooch. Lloyd reprised his role again in the season three episode &quot;A One Story Town&quot; which also featured Ken Jenkins, Robert Maschio, Zach Braff, Christa Miller, Sarah Chalke, and the Worthless Peons in cameo appearances at the end of the episode, with a confused Ted saying &quot;This is weird, man! Everyone here looks like someone from my old job.&quot;.

===Cinematography and delivery format===
The show is shot with a single instead of multiple-camera setup more typical for sitcoms. The season four episode &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot;, has a brief multiple-camera style, since it includes J.D.&#x27;s fantasies of life being more like a traditional sitcom.

John Inwood, the cinematographer of the series, shot the series with his own Aaton XTR prod Super16 film camera. Despite the fact that some broadcasters, such as the BBC, consider Super 16 a &quot;non-HD&quot; format, John Inwood believed that footage from his camera was not only sufficient to air in high definition, but it also &quot;looked terrific.&quot; The intro of the first season, which was broadcast in 4:3, has been reused in an HD version for season eight without any further change.

Except for the finale of season five, &quot;My Transition&quot;, which was broadcast in high definition, the first seven seasons of the show have been broadcast in standard definition with a 4:3 aspect ratio. After the show was moved from NBC to ABC, the broadcast format for new episodes changed to high definition and widescreen. John Inwood opined that older episodes could be rereleased that way, as well. From the very beginning, he filmed the show with widescreen delivery in mind so the whole series could be aired in widescreen when the market evolved.

All nine seasons have been released on DVD in 4:3 format. However, the eighth season was also released on Blu-ray Disc in the original widescreen format.

===Music===
Music plays a large role in &quot;Scrubs&quot;. A wide variety of rock, pop, and indie artists are featured, and almost every episode ends with a musical montage summing up the themes and plot lines of the episode, and the music for these montages is often picked even before the episodes are completely written.

Members of the cast and crew were encouraged to contribute song suggestions, with many ideas coming from series creator Bill Lawrence, writer Neil Goldman, and actors Zach Braff (whose college friends Cary Brothers and Joshua Radin appear on the &quot;Scrubs&quot; soundtrack) and Christa Miller (who selected Colin Hay and Tammany Hall NYC). According to Lawrence, &quot;Christa picks so much of the music for the show that a lot of the writers and actors don&#x27;t even go to me anymore when they have a song. They hand it to her.&quot;

Featured songs present in the original broadcasts appear unaltered in the DVD release of the show. However, a handful of songs were replaced in the versions released to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu due to licensing issues.

&quot;Scrubs&quot; featured a musical episode in the sixth season, &quot;My Musical&quot;, guest-starring Tony-nominated &quot;Avenue Q&quot; actress Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo. The episode was nominated for five Emmy Awards, winning one.

====Theme song====
The theme song of the series, performed by Lazlo Bane, is titled &quot;Superman&quot;, and can be found on the album &quot;All the Time in the World&quot;, as well as on the first &quot;Scrubs&quot; soundtrack. Lawrence credits Braff for finding and suggesting &quot;Superman&quot; as the theme song, with the specific lyric &quot;I&#x27;m no Superman&quot; serving as an allusion to the fallibility of the lead characters.

The &quot;Scrubs&quot; main title is performed at a faster tempo than the original recording of the song. The original, slower recording was used briefly at the beginning of season two, played during an extended version of the title sequence, as well as the opening for &quot;My Urologist&quot;, and a special edit of the title sequence for resulting in roughly 1–2 seconds of music, followed by the line &quot;I&#x27;m no Superman&quot;, accompanied by a quick flash of credits. The original introduction from season one was used through most of season three and then used for seasons four through eight. In the ninth and final season, a new version of &quot;Superman&quot; is used, performed by WAZ.

====Soundtracks====

Three official soundtracks have been released. The first soundtrack, &quot;Music From Scrubs&quot;, was released on CD on September 24, 2002. The second soundtrack, &quot;Scrubs Original Soundtrack Vol. 2&quot;, was released exclusively on iTunes on May 9, 2006. The third soundtrack, &quot;&quot;My Musical&quot; Soundtrack&quot;, featured the music composed and performed in musical episode &quot;My Musical&quot;; it was released on Amazon.com and iTunes on August 7, 2007.

====Featured musical contributors====
Colin Hay, the former frontman of Men at Work, has had music featured in at least seven episodes, and has appeared in the episode &quot;My Overkill&quot;, performing the song &quot;Overkill&quot; as a street musician, and in the episode &quot;My Hard Labor&quot; performing &quot;Down Under&quot;. Hay also sings &quot;Where Everybody Knows Your Name&quot;, the theme from &quot;Cheers&quot;, in the episode &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; and the episode &quot;My Philosophy&quot; features Hay&#x27;s song &quot;Waiting For My Real Life To Begin&quot;, sung by several members of the cast. He also appeared in &quot;My Finale&quot;.

The music of Joshua Radin, who is a friend of &quot;Scrubs&quot; star Zach Braff, appeared in six episodes.

Music by Keren DeBerg has featured in 15 episodes, and she appeared in &quot;My Musical&quot; as an extra in the song &quot;All Right&quot;.

Clay Aiken appeared in the episode &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; and performed the song &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Lovely?&quot; by Stevie Wonder.

====The Worthless Peons====
The Worthless Peons (also known as Ted&#x27;s Band, The Blanks, or in the &quot;My Way Home&quot; Director&#x27;s Cut, as &quot;Foghat&quot;) are an &quot;a cappella&quot; group made up of Sacred Heart hospital employees from different departments. They are a cover band, and often sing songs from a specific genre (for example, cartoon theme songs or commercial jingles).

The Worthless Peons are played by The Blanks, who are a real-life &quot;a cappella&quot; band made up of Sam Lloyd (who plays Ted), George Miserlis, Paul F. Perry, and Philip McNiven. The Blanks&#x27; album, &quot;Riding the Wave&quot;, features guest appearances from Lawrence and members of the &quot;Scrubs&quot; cast. This band was put on the show when Sam Lloyd brought his &quot;a cappella&quot; band to the &quot;Scrubs&quot; cast Christmas party. Lloyd told Lawrence about his band, and Lawrence got the idea of putting them in the show.

The Worthless Peons also sing the theme song to the web series &quot;Scrubs: Interns&quot;, which features the new interns from season eight learning about the hospital in the same way that J.D. did in season one. &quot;Interns&quot; is aired on the ABC website.

===Title sequence===
The chest X-ray featured at the end of the title sequence was hung backwards for most of the first five seasons. Lawrence has stated that having the X-ray backwards was intentional as it signified that the new interns were inexperienced. During Zach Braff&#x27;s audio commentary on &quot;My Last Chance&quot;, he states that the error was actually unintentional. The error became somewhat infamous and was even parodied in &quot;My Cabbage&quot;.

An attempt was made to fix the error in the extended title sequence used at the beginning of season two that included Neil Flynn, but the extended sequence (including corrected X-ray) was soon scrapped due to fan and network request. Finally, in &quot;My Urologist&quot;, Dr. Kim Briggs steps into the credits and switches the X-ray around, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s backwards; it&#x27;s been bugging me for years&quot;. At the beginning of season eight, when the series switched to ABC, the chest X-ray was once again backwards.

The ninth season features a new title sequence with a new version of the theme song &quot;Superman&quot; performed by WAZ. The new title sequences features the four new characters–Denise, Lucy, Drew, and Cole, as well as Dr. Cox and Turk, while J.D. is seen at the end placing the chest X-ray. In all season nine episodes that do not feature J.D., he is absent from the title sequence and Lucy is the one placing the X-ray. The X-ray at the end of the sequence is also not backwards and the subtitle &quot;Med School&quot; appears at the end of the sequence.

=== Podcast ===
On March 31, 2020, Zach Braff and Donald Faison launched their &quot;Scrubs&quot;-themed podcast &quot;Fake Doctors, Real Friends&quot; in partnership with iHeartRadio in which Braff and Faison rewatch each episode and give behind-the-scenes details on the series.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
====First eight seasons====
Throughout its original run, &quot;Scrubs&quot; received critical acclaim, with many critics praising its cast, characters, and humor (especially J.D.&#x27;s fantasy sequences). In 2006, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s website EW.com gave the overall series (the review was made early after the fifth-season premiere) a grade of &quot;A−&quot;, with the author saying &quot;&quot;Scrubs&quot; is the trickiest comedy on TV [...] A likable, daffy, buoyant series that would be a big annoying mess if it weren&#x27;t done just right, &quot;Scrubs&quot; is the very definition of nimble&quot;. IGN gave the first season a perfect score of 10. The seven following seasons were rated, respectively, 9, 9, 9, 8, 7.5, 8.3 and 7.5.

The Truth About Nursing, which checks the realism of the medical series, gave &quot;Scrubs&quot; a &quot;Nursing rating&quot; of 1.5 out of 4 stars, but an &quot;Artistic rating&quot; of 3 out of 4 stars, praising that &quot;despite the nasty and surreal elements, its characters are not above learning or growing, as they try to cope with the very real stresses of life and death at the hospital&quot;. However, the reviewer stated, &quot;The show&#x27;s portrayal of nursing has been less impressive&quot;.

Review aggregate Metacritic only assigned an average score to the eighth and ninth seasons, with the eighth season scoring 79/100, based on four reviews only (all positives), indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.
====Ninth season====
The ninth and final season received mixed reviews, with many critics heavily criticizing the new cast; it received a score of 64/100 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;. An IGN editor gave it a positive score of 7 out of 10, stating &quot;even though this was not the best season, I&#x27;ll always have fond memories of the show&quot;.

&quot;USA Today&quot; reviewer Robert Bianco wrote a negative review, stating &quot;The result is a deadly, deal-driven mistake that takes a network that has made great sitcom strides forward one unfortunate step back&quot;. He also noted that the presence of a few members of the original cast (Braff, Faison, and John C. McGinley) &quot;only makes it harder for the new characters to take hold&quot; (despite his additional criticism of Braff&#x27;s performance). Blogcritics gave it a mixed review, criticizing the new cast, but praising the performances by the original cast members.

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;Scrubs&quot; received 17 Emmy nominations, in categories such as casting, cinematography, directing, editing, and writing, winning only two. Its fourth season earned the series its first nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series. Zach Braff was also nominated that year for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. The series was nominated again the following year for Outstanding Comedy Series, and won its first Emmy, for Outstanding Picture Editing for a Multi-Camera Comedy Series, for &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; . At the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, the episode &quot;My Musical&quot; was nominated for five awards in four categories: Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series (Will Mackenzie), Outstanding Music Direction (Jan Stevens) and Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics (&quot;Everything Comes Down to Poo&quot; and &quot;Guy Love&quot;); and won its second Emmy (co-winner with &quot;Entourage&quot;), for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) And Animation (Joe Foglia, Peter J. Nusbaum, and John W. Cook II).

Braff was nominated for the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series, Comedy or Musical in 2005, 2006, and 2007.

The show won the 2002, 2008, and 2009 Humanitas Prize, an award created for rewarding human dignity, meaning, and freedom. It also won a Peabody Award.

<text>Meharry Medical College is a private historically black medical school affiliated with the United Methodist Church and located in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1876 as the Medical Department of Central Tennessee College, it was the first medical school for African Americans in the South. While the majority of African Americans lived in the South, they were excluded from many public and private racially segregated institutions of higher education, particularly after the end of Reconstruction.

Meharry Medical College was chartered separately in 1915. In the early 21st century, it has become the largest private historically black institution in the United States solely dedicated to educating health care professionals and scientists. The school has never been segregated.

Meharry Medical College includes its School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, a School of Allied Health Professions, School of Graduate Studies and Research, the Harold R. West Basic Sciences Center, and the Metropolitan General Hospital of Nashville-Davidson County. The degrees that Meharry offers include Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Master of Science in Public Health (M.S.P.H.), Master of Health Science (M.H.S.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. Meharry is the second-largest educator of African-American medical doctors and dentists in the United States. It has the highest percentage of African Americans graduating with Ph.Ds in the biomedical sciences in the country.

&quot;Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved&quot; is a public health journal owned by and edited at Meharry Medical College. Around 76% of graduates of the school work as doctors treating people in underserved communities. School training emphasizes recognizing health disparities in different populations.

==History==

Meharry Medical College was one of six medical institutions established between the years of 1876 and 1900 in the state of Tennessee. These schools were founded after the end of the Civil War when slaves had been freed. Because of their former restrictions, there were as yet few African-American physicians, and many freedmen in need of health care. Because of segregation, most hospitals would not admit African Americans, and many white physicians often chose not to serve freedmen. During the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, most medical institutions accepted few, if any, African-American students. To combat this shortage of health care and the lack of accessibility to medical education, individuals, such as Samuel Meharry, and organizations, such as the Medical Association of Colored Physicians, Surgeons, Dentists, and Pharmacists (later renamed the National Medical Association), helped to found medical schools specifically for African Americans.

The college was named for Samuel Meharry, a young Irish American immigrant who first worked as a salt trader on the Kentucky-Tennessee frontier. After achieving some success, he and four of his brothers later made a major donation to help establish the college. As a young trader, Meharry had been aided by a family of freedmen, whose names are unknown. Meharry reportedly told the formerly enslaved family, &quot;I have no money, but when I can I shall do something for your race.&quot;

Students at Central Tennessee College (CTC) approached the college president about setting up a medical school in 1875. The president, John Braden, approached Samuel Meharry to discuss the proposal. In 1875, Meharry, together with four of his brothers, donated a total of $15,000 to assist with establishing a medical department at (CTC), a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. With the contribution of the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church North, George W. Hubbard and Braden, they opened the Medical College at CTC in 1876 with a starting class of nine students. The classes took place in the basement of the Clark Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church. The first regular year of classes began in October 1876 and had eleven students in that group. The medical program was initially two years long, but they added an additional year in 1879 and a fourth year to the course of study in 1893.

Hubbard, a physician, served as the founding president of the medical college. The first student graduated in 1877. The second class, which had its commencement in 1878, had three graduates.

In 1886, the Dental Department was founded, followed by a Pharmacy Department founded in 1889. The Dental and Pharmaceutical Building was dedicated on October 20, 1889. By 1896, half of all &quot;regularly educated physicians then practicing in the South&quot; had graduated from Meharry.

A nurse-training school was also developed during the 1900–1901 school year and the first class had eight students. A training hospital, Mercy Hospital, was built during the 1901–1902 school year. This hospital was replaced in 1916 and named the George W. Hubbard Hospital. Meharry Auditorium, with a 1,000 person capacity, was built in 1904.

In 1900, CTC changed its name to Walden University. In 1915, the medical department faculty of Walden University received a separate charter to operate independently as Meharry Medical College. The college continued to be privately funded. The Medical College remained in its original buildings, and Walden University moved to another campus in Nashville in 1922.

In 1910, Meharry absorbed medical students from Flint Medical College when that school was closed. Meharry also graduated a large number of women physicians for the time period, with 39 women having graduated by 1920. Its reputation suffered in 1914 when it was dropped to Class B status. Abraham Flexner of the General Education Board (a Rockefeller program) provided advice and funding to rebuild its status. As a result in 1923, Meharry was restored to a &quot;grade-A institution&quot; by the American Medical Association (AMA).

Since its founding, Meharry Medical College has added several graduate programs in the areas of science, medicine, and public health. In 1938, the School of Graduate Studies and Research was founded. The first master&#x27;s degree program, a Master of Science in Public Health, was established in 1947. In the 1950s, the nursing school and dental technology school were ended. The department of Psychiatry was established in 1961 by school president, Lloyd Charles Elam, a psychiatrist. During the 1960s, Meharry began to focus on fighting health disparities. In 1968, Meharry created the Matthew Walker Health Center to provide health services to the community. Also in 1968, the school added a Ph.D. degree in basic sciences.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, 83 percent of all African American physicians had been trained at Meharry Medical College and Howard University School of Medicine. In 1970, more than 60 percent of black medical students worked as residents at these two colleges. In 1972, Meharry started receiving federal distress grants which were given to medical schools with deficits in operating costs and problems with accreditation. By 1976, the school campus took up space on 65 acres.

In 1981, the accrediting body of the AMA put Meharry on probation because there were not enough patients in the Hubbard Hospital for students and the student to teacher ratio was too high. In 1983, president Ronald Reagan allowed the school to work with patients in the nearby veterans&#x27; hospitals and the Blanchfield Army Community Hospital and the college regained full accreditation. By 1986, around 46 percent of all black faculty members in medical schools had graduated from Meharry.

In 1972, a Ph.D. program was implemented. A decade later in 1982, Meharry established an M.D/Ph.D. program. In 2004, Meharry created a Master&#x27;s of Science in Clinical Investigation program (2004).

The Hubbard Hospital, belonging to Meharry Medical College, closed in 1994 and was renovated as the new site for the Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital, opening November 1997. The year 1994 was also a start for more renovations of campus buildings initiated by campus president, John E. Maupin Jr. The school was also suffering from a $49 million deficit and morale at the school was low. The Nashville General Hospital&#x27;s lease money, however, helped bring money into the school and eventually, by June 1995, the finances of the school were stabilized. In 1999, the college partnered with Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In 2005, Meharry was censured by the American Association of University Professors for not observing generally recognized principles of academic freedom and tenure.

On November 9, 2017, Meharry, under president James E.K. Hildreth, signed a memorandum of agreement with Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), America&#x27;s largest for-profit operator of health care facilities. Under the agreement, Meharry&#x27;s medical students will gain clinical training at HCA&#x27;s TriStar Southern Hills Medical Center in Nashville. Meharry students had previously received clinical training at numerous sites, primarily Nashville General Hospital, which had moved on-campus in the 1990s. Withdrawal of the alliance with Meharry is thought to threaten the provision of inpatient care at Nashville General Hospital. A board member resigned over this surprise decision and announcement.

In April 2019, then-dean and senior vice president of health affairs Dr. Veronica Mallett secured a partnership with Detroit Medical Center to increase the number of Meharry students able to complete their studies at that hospital. Meharry students had been accepted at Sinai-Grace Hospital alongside Michigan State and Wayne State university students since July 2018.

In September 2020, philanthropist Michael Bloomberg donated $34 million to help lower student debt at the institution. Bloomberg&#x27;s gift is the largest in Meharry&#x27;s history.

In 2021, Meharry launched Meharry Medical College Ventures to aid in reducing health disparities through forming partnerships with medical facilities across the US. Mallett was the inaugural president and CEO, serving until 2023. She has been succeeded by Reginald Holt.

In March 2022, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Meharry. Scott&#x27;s gift is one of the largest in Meharry&#x27;s history.

In 2024, Meharry received a $175 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies to support the school&#x27;s endowment.

=== Presidents ===
George W. Hubbard served as Meharry Medical College&#x27;s first president from its founding in 1876 until his retirement in 1921.

The second president of the school was John J. Mullowney, who served from 1921 to 1938. He implemented changes in order to improve Meharry&#x27;s overall academic rating. Admission requirements were tightened and strictly enforced, a superintendent was installed at the hospital, and the number of faculty, research facilities, and hospital facilities were all expanded. Two years after Mullowney took leadership, Meharry Medical College recovered its ‘A’ rating.

Succeeding Meharry Medical College presidents have been:
* Edward Lewis Turner (1938–1944),
* M. Don Clawson (1944–1950),
* Harold D. West (1952–1966),
* Lloyd C. Elam (1968–1981),
* Richard G. Lester (1981–1982),
* David Satcher (1982–1993),
* John E. Maupin (1994–2006),
* Wayne J. Riley (2006–2013), 
* Anna Epps (2013–2015), 
* James E.K. Hildreth (2015–present)

From 1950 to 1952 a committee guided the institution instead of a president. In 1952, Meharry welcomed its first African-American president, Dr. Harold D. West. West made numerous changes, made possible by his successful $20 million fund drive. He added a new wing to Hubbard Hospital, eliminated the nursing and the dental technology programs, and purchased land adjacent to the campus for expansion.

==Research ==
Meharry Medical College spent $96 million on research during fiscal years between 2013 and 2017. The school has a Graduate Studies and Research department.

Research centers include:
*Asthma Disparities Center 
*Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neurosciences
*Center for Women&#x27;s Health Research 
*Clinical Research Center
*Export Center for Health Disparities 
*Meharry Center for Health Disparities Research in HIV 
*Sickle Cell Center

==BS/MD Program==
Twelve universities are in partnership with Meharry to better recruit and prepare their best pre-med students for the academic rigor of Meharry. The ten universities are Alabama A&amp;M University, Albany State University, Alcorn State University, Fisk University, Grambling State University, Hampton University, Jackson State University, Southern University, Tennessee State University, and Virginia Union University. Beginning Summer 2024, Tuskegee University joined the BS/MD partnership.

<doc id="217229" wikidata="Q2681974" url="?curid=217229" title="Speedy Trial Clause">
<text>The Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial...&quot;. The Clause protects the defendant from delay between the presentation of the indictment or similar charging instrument and the beginning of trial.

== History ==
In &quot;Barker v. Wingo&quot; (1972), the Supreme Court developed a four-part test that considers the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the defendant&#x27;s assertion of his right to a speedy trial, and the prejudice to the defendant. A violation of the Speedy Trial Clause is cause for dismissal with prejudice of a criminal case. Within these parameters, it was determined that the five-year wait for this case to go trial was not in violation of the Constitution. 

In 1974, Congress passed the Speedy Trial Act to help protect and clarify defendants&#x27; speedy trial rights.

==Speedy trial statutes==
In addition to the constitutional guarantee, various state and federal statutes confer a more specific right to a speedy trial. All U.S. states have either statutes or constitutional provisions detailing this right. In New York, the prosecution must be &quot;ready for trial&quot; within six months on all felonies except murder, or the charges are dismissed by action of law without regard to the merits of the case. This is also known as a &quot;ready rule&quot;.

The federal law detailing this right in federal actions is the Speedy Trial Act of 1974. In 1979 the Act was amended to ensure that the defendant had time to provide a suitable defense. This amendment made it so trial could not start within less than 30 days after the defendant first appeared in the court. In &quot;Zedner v. United States&quot; (2006) the Supreme Court determined that a defendant cannot waive his right to a speedy trial using the Speedy Trial Clause because the clause protects all parties involved in a case to ensure that no one&#x27;s interests are being implicated.

== Speedy trial cases ==
*In &quot;Barker v. Wingo&quot; (1972), the Supreme Court required a case-by-case analysis of potential Speedy Trial violations, and laid out a four-factor balancing test for lower courts to make that determination.

*In &quot;Doggett v. United States&quot; (1992) the Supreme Court determined that Doggett&#x27;s eight and a half year wait for a trial violated his sixth amendment rights.

<doc id="217231" wikidata="Q23722" url="?curid=217231" title="Curb Your Enthusiasm">
<text>Curb Your Enthusiasm is an American television comedy of manners created by Larry David that premiered on HBO with an hour-long special in October 17, 1999, followed by 12 seasons broadcast from October 15, 2000, to April 7, 2024. David stars as a fictionalized version of himself and it follows his life as a semi-retired television writer and producer in Los Angeles and, for one season, New York City. Also starring are Cheryl Hines as his wife Cheryl, Jeff Garlin as his manager and best friend Jeff Greene, Susie Essman as Jeff&#x27;s wife Susie, and J. B. Smoove as Larry&#x27;s housemate Leon Black. It often features celebrity guest stars, many of them playing fictionalized versions of themselves, including Ted Danson, Richard Lewis, Wanda Sykes, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, and Jon Hamm.

The sitcom was developed from a 1999 one-hour special, &quot;Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, which David and HBO originally envisioned as a one-time project. It was shot as a mockumentary, in which the characters were aware of the presence of cameras and a crew. The series, while not in documentary form, was shot in a somewhat similar cinéma vérité-like style. As with &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which David co-created, the humor of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; often revolves around the minutiae of everyday social life. Each episode&#x27;s plot and subplot is established in an outline written by David, and the actors largely improvise the dialogue, a technique known as retroscripting. In Season 7, the series began producing and airing episodes in high definition.

&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; received high critical acclaim and has grown in popularity since its debut. It was nominated for 55 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series for eleven of its twelve seasons. It won the 2002 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. It aired for eight mostly consecutive seasons until 2011, and resumed with a ninth season in 2017. The tenth season aired in 2020 and the eleventh in 2021. The series was renewed for a twelfth and final season that premiered on February 4, 2024, and the series finale aired on April 7, 2024.

== Premise ==
Larry David has explained the show&#x27;s name in TV interviews as reflecting his perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which he believes is used to imply that &quot;they are better than you&quot;. This conflicts with his dry style. The title also urges the audience not to expect too much from the show; at the time of the premiere, David wanted to lower expectations after his earlier success in the entertainment industry.

The series stars David as a fictionalized version of himself. Like the real-life David, the character is well known as a co-creator and main co-writer of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Although Larry maintains an office, he is rarely shown working. Episodes frequently center on his ignorance of or disregard for well-established social conventions and expectations, and his insistence that others adhere to rules of which only he seems to be aware. This social ineptitude, combined with an inability to let even the most minor grievance or annoyance go unexpressed, often leads him into awkward social situations and draws the ire of his friends, family, and total strangers. He is also routinely the victim of labyrinthine misunderstandings wherein people think he has done something immoral or distasteful.

For the first half of the series, David is living a married, child-free life in Los Angeles with his wife, Cheryl (Cheryl Hines). His main confidant on the show is his manager and friend Jeff Greene (Jeff Garlin). Susie Essman plays Susie Greene, Jeff&#x27;s short-tempered wife, who is frequently at odds with Larry. Many of the show&#x27;s frequent guest stars are celebrities and public figures, who usually play fictionalized versions of themselves. Among the more frequently recurring guest stars are Larry&#x27;s longtime friend Richard Lewis as well as Ted Danson and his wife Mary Steenburgen.

The show is set and filmed in various affluent Westside communities of (and occasionally in downtown) Los Angeles, as well as in the adjacent cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City, and Santa Monica. David&#x27;s hometown of New York City is featured in some of season 8.

== Episodes ==
&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; premiered with an hour-long special on October 17, 1999, upon which the series was based. The series&#x27; first eight seasons aired from 2000 to 2011. The series took a prolonged hiatus before returning for a ninth season in 2017, a tenth in 2020, and an eleventh in 2021. It was renewed for a twelfth season in August 2022, which was confirmed to be the final season in December 2023. The final season premiered on February 4, 2024.

The episodes are typically named after an event, object, or person that figures prominently in the plot, much as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes were titled. Unrelated events woven throughout an episode are tied into a climax that resolves the story lines simultaneously, to Larry&#x27;s advantage or detriment. Each episode has a distinct plot, but most seasons feature a story arc that extends across several episodes and culminates in a finale that often features the return of many of the characters who appeared throughout the season.

== Characters ==
=== Main cast ===


* Larry David as a fictionalized version of himself, the show&#x27;s idiosyncratic, tactless and curmudgeonly protagonist. Larry is a semi-retired television writer and producer. Born and raised in New York, he is the only child of Nat and Adele David. He is Jewish, but he is not observant and is willing to betray his heritage (or overemphasize it) when it suits him. After years struggling as a writer and comic, he gained massive success with the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Having made a fortune off the show, Larry now works only occasionally. Stubborn and self-centered, he frequently flouts social conventions he perceives as pointless, inconvenient, or nonsensical. But at the same time, he rebukes friends, acquaintances, and strangers for failing to adhere to his self-imposed (and often equally nonsensical) social rules. Larry often becomes obsessed with minute, insignificant details of others&#x27; behavior, and is seemingly unable to let any grievance, annoyance, or inappropriate remark go unexpressed. He is often reluctant to apologize to people he has offended, firmly believing himself to be in the right and going to extreme lengths to prove the correctness of his beliefs and actions. When he does apologize, he usually does so only because he needs something, and he is often more self-defensive than truly apologetic. But Larry is generally well-intentioned, and is often simply a victim of circumstance, finding himself at the center of complex misunderstandings or falling victim to others&#x27; selfishness and/or stupidity. He is even at times celebrated by those around him for his candor and his willingness to call others out for their hypocrisy.
* Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene, Larry&#x27;s manager and best friend. He is married to Susie Greene (Susie Essman), with whom he has a daughter, Sammi (Ashly Holloway). Jeff and Susie have a tumultuous marriage, due in large part to Jeff&#x27;s frequent extramarital affairs as well as Susie&#x27;s incessant criticism of Jeff, most often in regard to his weight and cheating. Jeff often recruits Larry in his efforts to cover up his affairs from Susie, though these efforts usually fall apart. Garlin has said that he does not empathize with his character at all, calling him a &quot;pretty evil guy&quot; who has &quot;no morals, no scruples&quot;.
* Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (seasons 1–7, 9–12; guest season 8), Larry&#x27;s long-suffering wife (and later ex-wife). Patient, friendly, and generally easygoing, she serves as a comic foil to the stubborn and nit-picky Larry and often serves as a voice of reason. She is nominally an actress, but is not shown working for most of the series. She is very environmentally conscious and devotes a great deal of her time and money to charitable causes, particularly the NRDC. Unlike Larry, Cheryl is outgoing, enjoys most social functions, and is the primary agent in maintaining many of the couple&#x27;s friendships. She is also the driving force behind many of Larry&#x27;s apologies. While she feels a deep affection for Larry and often shows patience with his foibles, she has her limits, particularly with his obsession over unimportant details. She is finally pushed to her breaking point in the season 6 episode &quot;The TiVo Guy&quot; when, aboard a flight experiencing severe turbulence, she calls Larry to tell him she loves him. To her shock and anger, Larry pays no attention to what is ostensibly his wife&#x27;s final goodbye and instead badgers her with questions about their DVR. In the wake of the incident, Cheryl leaves Larry. They briefly reunite at the end of season 7 before Cheryl is once again driven away by Larry&#x27;s obsession with details, in particular a stain Cheryl&#x27;s coffee cup left on Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s table. They finalize their divorce at the start of season 8. In season 9, Cheryl begins dating Larry&#x27;s friend Ted Danson. Before that, she and Ted had a close, platonic friendship, of which Larry was always suspicious.
* Susie Essman as Susie Greene (seasons 8–12; recurring seasons 1–7), Jeff&#x27;s loud and overbearing wife, known for her explosive temper. Her interactions with Larry often begin friendly and quickly degrade into vicious arguments. Shrewd and perpetually suspicious of both Jeff and Larry, Susie is often the first to uncover their schemes and wrongdoing and often rebukes them with profanity-laced tirades. Susie and Jeff have an &quot;on-again, off-again&quot; relationship. She often uses Larry as a scapegoat for her marital problems. She often defends traditional moral standards, such as the sanctity of marital vows and fealty to hearth and home, at times against Jeff, at others against Larry, and usually against both.
* J. B. Smoove as Leon Black (seasons 9–12; recurring seasons 6–8), Larry&#x27;s friend, and later, roommate (casita). He is the brother of Loretta Black, a single mother whose New Orleans home was destroyed by Hurricane Edna. When Larry and Cheryl take in Loretta and her family, Leon moves in too, despite living in Los Angeles and having been unaffected by the hurricane. When Loretta and her children move back to Louisiana, Leon stays behind. He and Larry develop an unlikely friendship, with Leon frequently offering Larry questionable advice on romance, business, and social interactions. Like Larry, Leon is blunt and often confrontational, although unlike Larry, his confrontations with others end favorably for him. Leon first appears in the season 6 episode &quot;The Anonymous Donor&quot;.

=== Recurring roles ===

Among the show&#x27;s many recurring roles, Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, and Wanda Sykes play fictionalized versions of themselves as old friends of Larry with whom he frequently butts heads. Shelley Berman plays Larry&#x27;s father, Nat David. Bob Einstein frequently appears as Marty Funkhouser, another of Larry&#x27;s longtime friends. Kaitlin Olson recurs as Becky, Cheryl&#x27;s sister. In seasons 6 and 7, Vivica A. Fox appears as Loretta Black, a member of the Black family, a family of hurricane evacuees who take refuge in Larry&#x27;s house upon Cheryl&#x27;s invitation. Loretta becomes Larry&#x27;s primary love interest for a time after he and Cheryl split up. Saverio Guerra plays Mocha Joe, who first appears in season 7 and returns as Larry&#x27;s nemesis in season 10.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; has received critical acclaim, praised particularly for its writing and the actors&#x27; improvisational comedy. The show enjoyed largely positive critical reception since its debut and outgrew its early &quot;cult&quot; status.

On Metacritic, the first season of the show scored 80 out of 100 (based on 20 reviews), 93 for season 3 (based on 12 reviews), 88 for season 4 (18 reviews), 91 for season 5 (5 reviews), 89 for season 6 (9 reviews), 81 for season 7 (18 reviews), 86 for season 8 (6 reviews), 74 for season 9 (10 reviews), 78 for season 10 (5 reviews), 89 for season 11 (7 reviews), and 82 for season 12 (17 reviews).

&quot;Slate&quot; named the characters Cheryl David and Susie Greene two of the best on television and reasons to look forward to the show&#x27;s return in 2007. &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; has also received praise from &quot;Galus Australis&quot; magazine for being even more unabashedly Jewish than &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Of the show&#x27;s depiction of Jewish characters, academic Vincent Brook wrote, &quot;&quot;Curb&quot;″s commitment to Jewish identification greatly enhances its storytelling capacity, as it lends greater realism and dimension to the characters and opens the show up to episodes with meaningful Jewish themes.&quot;

The character of Larry is in many ways reminiscent of the &quot;schlemiel&quot; character in traditional Yiddish folklore. The &quot;schlemiel&quot; is usually a comic character whose actions lead to his inevitable downfall, but also stands as a form of resistance to social and cultural values and norms. David Gillota wrote: 

In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; #30 on its list of the 101 Best Written TV Series. In 2016, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; the 19th-greatest television series ever made.

===Awards and nominations===

The series received 55 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning twice: Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Robert B. Weide for &quot;Krazee-Eyez Killa&quot; in 2003, and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series for Steven Rasch for &quot;Palestinian Chicken&quot; in 2012. The series received eleven nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series. Larry David received seven nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Cheryl Hines received two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Shelley Berman and Michael J.

== Syndication ==
When aired in syndication, the series is edited from its original HBO broadcast (for running time and without the TV-MA scenes). On June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the TV Guide Network, making its basic cable debut. The network also recorded a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Discussion&quot;, debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. The show was produced by Scott Carter and hosted by &quot;Curb&quot; co-star Susie Essman.

The show debuted in syndication on local stations and WGN America in September 2010, but was removed the following year due to low ratings.

It debuted on TV Land in February 2013 but was later removed in 2015.

== Home media ==

=== VHS release ===
The first season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; was released on VHS in a three-volume box set.

=== DVD releases ===
&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; seasons come in a two-disc DVD set with ten episodes.

==Other media==
=== Book ===
A &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; book was released on October 19, 2006, published by Gotham Books. The book contains stories from Larry David&#x27;s past, original interviews and commentary, episode outlines, episode guide, and over 100 full-color photographs. The contents of the book span the first five seasons of the show.

=== Music ===
The show is punctuated between scenes with music orchestrated by Wendell Yuponce and from a music library company called Killer Tracks. Frequently heard are instrumental arrangements of the whimsical &quot;Three Little Maids From School Are We&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, and the rhythmic Gypsy dance &quot;Les tringles des sistres tintaient&quot; from &quot;Carmen&quot;.

The opening and closing theme song (not mentioned in the credits) is &quot;Frolic&quot; by Italian composer . Larry David heard the music used in a bank commercial years before the show was created and thought it had a lighthearted, joyful quality. An unofficial soundtrack was released by Mellowdrama Records in 2006.

=== Documentary ===
The 2017 Netflix documentary film &quot;Long Shot&quot; contains raw footage from the filming of an episode of season 4 at Dodger Stadium which helped to inadvertently exonerate Juan Catalan, who was accused of murder and faced the death penalty, by giving him an alibi during the time the murder was committed.

== In popular culture ==

The show&#x27;s main theme has been used as an internet meme, paired with clips of people in awkward situations.

<doc id="217237" wikidata="Q7250575" url="?curid=217237" title="Prosecutorial misconduct">
<text>In jurisprudence, prosecutorial misconduct or prosecutorial overreach is &quot;an illegal act or failing to act, on the part of a prosecutor, especially an attempt to sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than appropriate punishment.&quot; It is similar to selective prosecution. Prosecutors are bound by a set of rules which outline fair and dispassionate conduct.

==Types of misconduct==
* Failure to disclose exculpatory evidence
* False confession
* Falsified evidence
* Malicious prosecution
* Prosecutorial corruption
* Retaliatory prosecution
* Selective prosecution
* Subornation of perjury

==Examples and remedies==

In late 1993, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that John Demjanjuk had been a victim of prosecutorial misconduct during a 1986 trial in which federal prosecutors withheld evidence. Demjanjuk&#x27;s sentence was overturned, but he lost when his case was retried. See &quot;Brady v Maryland&quot;.

In the 1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson, the defense argued that Los Angeles Police Department detective Mark Fuhrman had planted evidence at the crime scene. Although Fuhrman denied the allegations, Simpson was found not guilty, although he was later held liable for the deaths in a civil suit filed by the families of the victims. In &quot;USA Today&quot; (August 24, 1995), Francis Fukuyama stated, &quot;[Such defenses lead to] a distrust of government and the belief that public authorities are in a vast conspiracy to violate the rights of individuals.&quot; However, such misconduct may actually be widespread in the United States. &quot;It’s a result-oriented process today, fairness be damned,&quot; Robert Merkle, former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said. Prosecutors are protected from civil liability even when they knowingly and maliciously break the law in order to secure convictions, and the doctrine of harmless error can be used by appellate courts to uphold convictions despite such illegal tactics, which some argue gives prosecutors few incentives to comply with the law.

In 2011 a Texas man, Michael Morton was released from prison after serving nearly 25 years for the murder of his wife in 1987. He was released after DNA evidence pointed to another man as the killer. The prosecutor, Ken Anderson later pleaded guilty to withholding evidence that could have helped Morton fight the murder charge. He was sentenced to spend 10 days in jail and was also disbarred.

Despite such, the defense has been successful in roughly 1 out of 6 times it has been used from 1970 to 2003. During that period, judges have cited misconduct by prosecutors as a reason to dismiss charges, reverse convictions, or reduce sentences in 2,012 cases, according to a study by the Center for Public Integrity released in 2003; the researchers looked at 11,452 cases in which misconduct was alleged.

A debate persists over the meaning of the term. Prosecutors have asked judges to stop using the term to refer to an unintentional error, and to restrict its use to describe a breach of professional ethics. E. Norman Veasey, the chief justice of Delaware Supreme Court, answered one such request in 2003 by noting the term&#x27;s extensive use in rulings over the past 60 years. &quot;We believe it would be confusing to change the terminology in view of this history,&quot; he wrote in reply.

<doc id="217239" wikidata="Q1798619" url="?curid=217239" title="Lipscomb University">
<text>Lipscomb University is a private Christian university in Nashville, Tennessee. It is affiliated with the Churches of Christ. The campus is located in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville; it also maintains one satellite location called &quot;Spark&quot; in Downtown Nashville to serve the business community. Total student enrollment for the fall 2022 semester was 4,704, which included 2,955 undergraduate students and 1,749 graduate students. Lipscomb has been rated the #3 Best College in Tennessee. 

==History==

Lipscomb University was founded in 1891 by David Lipscomb and James A. Harding. The campus grounds consist predominantly of the former estate of David Lipscomb, who donated it to the school. The school was always intended to function as a Christian liberal arts institution. It is still affiliated with the Churches of Christ and a seminary is part of the university.

In an early catalog, the founders expressed their views about providing a liberal education that included Christian underpinning:

Several prominent Church of Christ ministers received at least a portion of their higher education here (see Notable alumni below). The university remains thoroughly affiliated in the Churches of Christ: Potential full-time, undergraduate faculty must prove their membership in a Church of Christ before being hired.

Its original name was the Nashville Bible School, which was changed to David Lipscomb College, then to Lipscomb University. Lipscomb graduated its first senior class in 1948, leaving behind the name of junior college forever. In 1954, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Lipscomb its first accreditation. In 1988, Lipscomb attained Level III (master&#x27;s degree-granting) status and became known as Lipscomb University.

Some academic buildings were built with tax-exempt municipal bonds, and, because Lipscomb is a Christian school, this led to an extended lawsuit on the basis of whether or not a private religious institution is allowed to use public bonds. This case was debated for many years and ultimately made it to the Supreme Court.

In September 2020, Lipscomb announced that it would be merging with the Austin Graduate School of Theology in Austin, Texas. The merger would become official in January 2021, with Lipscomb managing all of AGST&#x27;s affairs and expanding their course offerings. Later, AGST folded due to financial troubles.

===Presidents===

There have been 14 superintendents or presidents of Lipscomb over 18 administrations.
*James A. Harding (1891–1901)
*William Anderson (1901–1905)
*J. S. Ward (1905–1906)
*E. A. Elam (1906–1913)
*J. S. Ward (1913)
*H. Leo Boles (1913–1920)
*A. B. Lipscomb (1920–1921)
*H. S. Lipscomb (1921–1923)
*H. Leo Boles (1923–1932)
*Batsell Baxter (1932–1934)
*E. H. Ijams (1934–1943)
*Batsell Baxter (1943–1946)
*Athens Clay Pullias (1946–1977)
*G. Willard Collins (1977–1986)
*Harold Hazelip (1987–1997)
*Steve Flatt (1997–2005)
*L. Randolph Lowry III (2005–2021)
*Candice McQueen (2021–present)

The Nashville Bible School was co-founded in 1891 by college founders David Lipscomb and James A. Harding. David Lipscomb never served as president, but as chairman of the board of trustees. James A. Harding served as the school&#x27;s first superintendent.

==Campus==
The James D. Hughes Center houses all the university&#x27;s health-science programs and the physician assistant program. The Nursing and Health Sciences Center next door houses the graduate College of Nursing.

Lipscomb has announced plans for a new College of Business building and a new performing arts center.

==Student life==
Lipscomb does not have fraternities and sororities. Rather, it has social clubs, which are local and unique to Lipscomb University and are not part of any national Greek system.

&quot;The Babbler&quot; is the defunct student newspaper and was published weekly during the spring and fall semesters. The title of the publication came from Acts 17:18 which in part says &quot;What does this babbler have to say?&quot; &quot;The Backlog&quot; is the school&#x27;s yearbook and is published annually. The Lumination Network, the school&#x27;s converged student media outlet, replaced the weekly &quot;Babbler&quot; and is tied heavily with the academic program of the Department of Communication and Journalism. &quot;Lumination Network is Lipscomb University’s official student news service.&quot; An independent student newsletter, the &quot;Lipscomb Underground&quot;, provided unfiltered student opinion for the campus. The LU originally ran from 1994 to 2008, resurfacing in 2016, and persisting on Twitter until 2018. The name &quot;Lipscomb Underground&quot; comes from the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot; which in part says &quot;Make for the sewers, go underground!&quot;
==Student body==

, Lipscomb University had 39% male students and 61% female students.

==Athletics==


Lipscomb athletic teams are the Bisons. The university is a member of the Division I level of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the ASUN Conference.

Lipscomb competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

The university has an ongoing sports rivalry with Belmont University, just down the road from Lipscomb. Traditionally, basketball games between the two schools are called the &quot;Battle of the Boulevard&quot;. In 2006, the rivalry reached a new level when Belmont and Lipscomb advanced to the finals of the Atlantic Sun tournament at the Memorial Center in Johnson City, Tennessee, with the winner earning its first-ever bid to the NCAA tournament. Belmont won 74–69 in overtime. Lipscomb was invited to the National Invitation Tournament as the regular-season conference champion, &quot;the program&#x27;s first-ever post-season appearance.&quot;

In 2019, Lipscomb made the NIT basketball finals, falling to the Texas Longhorns.

== Early life and education ==
On December 29, 1947, Danson was born in San Diego to Edward Bridge &quot;Ned&quot; Danson Jr., an archaeologist and curator of the Museum of Northern Arizona from 1959 to 1975, and Jessica Harriet (née MacMaster). He has an older sister, Jessica Ann &quot;Jan&quot; Haury. Danson was primarily raised in Flagstaff, Arizona. He has Scottish and English heritage. Their ancestors lived in colonial New England and are descended from historical figures such as Anne Hutchinson.

In 1961, at age 14, Danson enrolled at the Kent School, a university-preparatory school in Connecticut; he was a star player on the basketball team. He became interested in drama while later attending Stanford University. In his search for a better acting program, he transferred to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated with a B.F.A. in Drama in 1972.

== Career ==
=== 1975–1981: Early roles ===
Danson began his television career as a contract player on the daytime soap opera &quot;Somerset&quot;. He played the role of Tom Conway from 1975 to 1976. In 1977, he played Dr. Mitchell Pierson on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;, having also appeared earlier in 1975 as another character, Dr. Chuck Weldon. He was also in a number of commercials, most notably as the &quot;Aramis man&quot;. His guest appearances on television in the late 1970s and early 1980s include being on &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Witch&quot;, and &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;. He also appeared in the films &quot;The Onion Field&quot; (his first film, as the bagpipe-playing Officer Ian Campbell) and &quot;Body Heat&quot;.

=== 1982–1992: &quot;Cheers&quot; and stardom ===
In 1982, Danson was cast in the role of Sam Malone, a former local-legend baseball player and bartender, for the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. On the show, he has an on-again-off-again relationship with the college-educated, sophisticated Diane Chambers. Although the show finished last in ratings in its first season, it was well-received by critics. Ratings gradually improved by 1983, and by 1986, &quot;Cheers&quot; was among the top ten most-viewed shows on television. The series ran for 11 seasons (1982–1993), with the series finale (May 20, 1993) being watched by 80 million people, the second-most watched series finale in television history (in 1993). &quot;Cheers&quot; won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series, plus a Golden Globe for Best Series–Musical or Comedy. During his time on the show, Danson won two of his 11 consecutive Emmy nominations for the role of Sam Malone, and won two of his nine Golden Globe nominations. In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine named &quot;Cheers&quot; the 18th &quot;Greatest Show of All Time&quot;. It was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Shows of All Time&quot;. On December 15, 1988, Danson got into a minor car accident in which he got a bloody nose; he was in some pain, but his nose wasn&#x27;t broken. The bloody nose was written into the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;How to Win Friends and Electrocute People&quot;. Danson reprised the role of Sam Malone in a second-season episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, and did the voiceover for his character in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;.

Danson also appeared in numerous films during his time on the series. His most notable film appearances included &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; with Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg, its sequel &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;, and &quot;Cousins&quot; with Isabella Rossellini. He also appeared in &quot;Creepshow&quot;, &quot;Little Treasure&quot;, &quot;Just Between Friends&quot; (with Mary Tyler Moore), &quot;A Fine Mess&quot;, and &quot;Dad&quot;. Although he was best known for his work in comedy, he also appeared in a television drama, &quot;Something About Amelia&quot;, about a family devastated by the repercussions of incest, which co-starred his later co-star on &quot;Damages&quot;, Glenn Close. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and was nominated for an Emmy Award. 

=== 1994–2014: Post-&quot;Cheers&quot; roles ===
After &quot;Cheers&quot; ended, Danson appeared in films such as &quot;Made in America&quot;, &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot;, &quot;Loch Ness&quot;, and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. In 1996, three years after &quot;Cheers&quot; concluded, Danson starred in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Ink&quot; with his real-life wife Mary Steenburgen. In the same year, they starred as Lemuel Gulliver and his wife in an acclaimed television miniseries of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Danson went on to star in the successful CBS sitcom &quot;Becker&quot; (produced by Paramount Television which also produced &quot;Cheers&quot;), which ran from 1998 to 2004. Danson also plays a fictionalized version of himself on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In 1999, Danson was presented with a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Danson returned to series television in 2006, playing a psychiatrist in the ABC sitcom &quot;Help Me Help You&quot;, which was canceled at midseason due to low ratings. Also in 2006, Danson received a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for his role in &quot;Knights of the South Bronx&quot;. In 2007, Danson starred in the FX Network drama &quot;Damages&quot; as a corrupt billionaire, Arthur Frobisher. The role earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, but he lost to co-star Željko Ivanek. During the second season Danson became a recurring character instead of one of the principal cast. He received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series but lost to Michael J. Fox for Fox&#x27;s guest appearance in &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. In 2011, Danson appeared in the music video for &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; by the Beastie Boys. He is also mentioned in the song&#x27;s lyrics.

Danson starred in the HBO sitcom &quot;Bored to Death&quot; as George Christopher, the laconic and sometime downright infantile editor of &quot;Edition&quot; magazine. Critics often praised Danson as being the highlight of the program, calling his character a &quot;scene stealer.&quot; From 2011 to 2015, Danson starred in the CBS police drama &quot;&quot;. He played D.B. Russell, a new graveyard-shift supervisor who previously headed a crime lab in Seattle. Tony Shalhoub, Robin Williams, and John Lithgow were also considered for the role. He reprised his role in the third &quot;CSI&quot; spin-off, &quot;&quot;, which was canceled after two seasons.

=== 2015–present === 
In 2015, Danson appeared in the second season of the TV show &quot;Fargo&quot;, portraying Sheriff Hank Larsson. From 2016 to 2020 Danson appeared opposite Kristen Bell as the character Michael in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Good Place&quot;. He was nominated for and won numerous awards for his performance as Michael. Danson had the main role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Mr. Mayor&quot; (2021–2022), in which he plays a wealthy businessman who runs for mayor of Los Angeles for all the wrong reasons. Episode 109 of the &quot;Beef and Dairy Network Podcast&quot;, entitled &quot;Ted Danson&quot;, features Danson playing an alternate version of himself (referred to as &quot;The Actor Ted Danson&quot;) seeking to collect on a debt of 460 million tons of grain. In 2024, he starred as the leading role of Charles in the Netflix comedy series, &quot;A Man on the Inside&quot;, based on the 2020 Academy Award-nominee documentary &quot;The Mole Agent&quot;. As of 2024, Danson has appeared as a regular in twelve television shows, reportedly the most any actor has done historically.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and relationships === 

Danson and his first wife, actress Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Gosch (known as Randy Danson), were married in 1970 and divorced in 1975.

Danson&#x27;s second wife was producer Cassandra &quot;Casey&quot; Coates, whom he married in 1977. On December 24, 1979, while giving birth to their first daughter, Kate, Coates suffered a stroke. Danson spent several years caring for her and helping her recuperate. They later adopted a second daughter, Alexis. His affair with actress Whoopi Goldberg contributed to their divorce in 1993. At the time, it was known as one of Hollywood&#x27;s costliest divorces and reportedly cost Danson $30 million.

==== Whoopi Goldberg ====
While a guest on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in late 1988, he met actress Whoopi Goldberg; he describes her as &quot;a sexy, funny woman&quot;. They became friends and were in &quot;Help Save Planet Earth&quot; in 1990 which is about saving the environment (Danson played himself, Goldberg portrayed Mother Earth). While making &quot;Made in America&quot; in April 1992, the two became romantically involved, a pairing that was heavily featured in gossip tabloids such as the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. The couple also appeared on the &quot;Rock the Vote &quot;TV special in the same year; they were set to star in a Paramount-produced version of Neal Barrett Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Pink Vodka Blues&quot;, written by Marshall Brickman.

Danson received negative press attention October 8, 1993, after his appearance wearing blackface at a Friars Club comedy roast in honor of Goldberg, and for using many racist slurs. Later, Goldberg defended the sketch, explaining that she had helped write much of the material and referred Danson to the makeup artist who painted his face as a societal critique.

==== Mary Steenburgen ====
On October 7, 1995, Danson married actress Mary Steenburgen, whom he met on the set of &quot;Pontiac Moon&quot; in 1993, and became the stepfather to Steenburgen&#x27;s children, Lilly and Charlie, from her previous marriage to actor Malcolm McDowell. Danson has been on a plant-based diet multiple times, but as of 2016, he is on a pescetarian diet. Danson is Episcopalian.

Danson&#x27;s interest in environmental concerns began when he was 12 years old. Bill Breed, then curator of geology at the Museum of Northern Arizona, introduced Danson and their friend Marc Gaede to a &quot;game&quot; he referred to as &quot;billboarding&quot;. Armed with axes and saws, Breed, Gaede, and Danson destroyed over 500 outdoor advertising signs.

Danson&#x27;s interest in environmentalism continued over the years, and he began to be concerned with the state of the world&#x27;s oceans. He was a contributing founder of the American Oceans Campaigns in the 1980s; it merged with Oceana in 2001 and he is a board member. His commitment to the environment led him to host the A&amp;E television series &quot;Challenge of the Seas&quot; in 1991, filming 26 one-hour episodes.

In March 2011, Danson published his first book, &quot;Oceana: Our Endangered Oceans and What We Can Do To Save Them&quot; which was written with journalist Michael D&#x27;Orso. On October 25, 2019, Danson was arrested and charged along with actress Jane Fonda at a climate-change protest outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.

=== Political activism ===
Danson is a friend of former President Bill Clinton, who attended Danson and Steenburgen&#x27;s wedding. Danson has donated over $177,000 as of June 2024 to Democratic candidates and PACs, including Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Al Gore, John Edwards, Barbara Boxer, Bill Clinton, Al Franken, John Kerry, and the Jane Fonda Climate PAC. He has also donated to the Democratic Party of Arkansas and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Danson and Steenburgen campaigned for Senator Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. He attended the wedding of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s daughter Chelsea on July 31, 2010. He appeared with Steenburgen at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. On October 3, 2016, he attended the opening of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s new campaign office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania at the old Queen Pharmacy on King Street.

<text>John Demjanjuk (born Ivan Mykolaiovych Demjanjuk; 3 April 1920 – 17 March 2012) was a Trawniki man and Nazi camp guard at Sobibor extermination camp, Majdanek, and Flossenbürg. Demjanjuk became the center of global media attention in the 1980s, when he was tried and convicted in Israel after being identified as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;, a notoriously cruel watchman at Treblinka extermination camp. In 1993, the verdict was overturned. Shortly before his death, he was tried and convicted in the Federal Republic of Germany as an accessory to the 28,060 murders that occurred during his service at Sobibor.

Born in Soviet Ukraine, Demjanjuk was conscripted into the Red Army in 1940. He fought in World War II and was taken prisoner by the Germans in spring 1942, becoming a Trawniki collaborator. After training, he served at Sobibor extermination camp and at least two concentration camps. After the war, he married a woman he met in a West German displaced persons camp, and emigrated with her and their daughter to the United States. They settled in Seven Hills, Ohio, where he worked in an auto factory and raised three children. Demjanjuk became a US citizen in 1958.

In 1977, Demjanjuk was accused of war crimes. Based on eyewitness testimony by Holocaust survivors in Israel, he was identified as the notorious Ivan the Terrible from Treblinka. Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel in 1986 for trial. In 1988, Demjanjuk was convicted and sentenced to death. He maintained his innocence, claiming that it was a case of mistaken identity. In 1993, the verdict was overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court, based on new evidence that cast reasonable doubt over his identity as Ivan the Terrible. Although the judges agreed there was sufficient evidence to show that Demjanjuk had served at Sobibor, Israel declined to prosecute. In September 1993, Demjanjuk was allowed to return to Ohio. In 1999, US prosecutors again sought to deport Demjanjuk for having been a concentration camp guard, and his citizenship was revoked in 2002. In 2009, Germany requested his extradition for over 27,900 counts of acting as an accessory to murder, one for each person killed at Sobibor during the time when he was alleged to have served there as a guard. He was deported from the US to Germany in that same year. In 2011, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.

According to legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, in spite of serious missteps along the way, the German verdict brought the case &quot;to a worthy and just conclusion&quot;. After the conviction, Demjanjuk was released pending appeal. He lived at a German nursing home in Bad Feilnbach, where he died in 2012. Having died before a final judgment on his appeal could be issued, Demjanjuk remains technically innocent under German law. In 2020, a photograph album by Sobibor guard Johann Niemann was made public; some historians have suggested that a guard who appears in two photos may have been Demjanjuk.
==Background==
Demjanjuk was born in Dubovi Makharyntsi (formerly Kiev Governorate, presently Koziatyn district, Vinnytsia Oblast), a farming village in the western part of Soviet Ukraine. His boyhood coincided with the Holodomor famine, and he later worked as a tractor driver in a Soviet collective farm. In 1940, he was drafted into the Red Army. After a battle in eastern Crimea, he was taken prisoner by the Germans and was held in a camp for Soviet prisoners of war in Chełm. According to German records, Demjanjuk most likely arrived at Trawniki concentration camp to be trained as a camp guard for the Nazis on 13 June 1942. He was assigned to a manorial estate called Okzów on 22 September 1942, but returned to Trawniki on 14 October. He was transferred to Majdanek concentration camp, where he was disciplined on 18 January 1943. He was sent back to Trawniki and on 26 March 1943 he was assigned to Sobibor concentration camp. On 1 October 1943, he was transferred to Flossenbürg, where he served until at least 10 December 1944.

Demjanjuk later claimed to have been drafted into the Russian Liberation Army in 1944; however, an investigation conducted in the 1990s by the US Office of Special Investigations (OSI) found this to be a cover story. OSI was unable to establish Demjanjuk&#x27;s whereabouts from December 1944 to the end of the war. After the end of the war, Demjanjuk spent time in several displaced persons (DP) camps in Germany. Initially, Demjanjuk hoped to emigrate to Argentina or Canada; however, under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, he applied to move to the United States. His application stated that he had worked as a driver in the town of Sobibór in eastern Poland; the nearby Sobibor extermination camp was named after the village. Demjanjuk later claimed this was a coincidence, and said that he picked the name Sobibor from an atlas owned by a fellow applicant because it had a large Soviet population. Historian Hans-Jürgen Bömelburg observed in regard to Demjanjuk that Nazi war criminals sometimes tried to evade prosecution after the war by presenting themselves as victims of Nazi persecution rather than as the perpetrators.

Demjanjuk found a job as a driver in a displaced persons camp in the Bavarian city of Landshut, and was subsequently transferred to camps in other southern German cities, until ending up in Feldafing near Munich in May 1951. There he met Vera Kowlowa, another DP, and they married. Demjanjuk, his wife and daughter arrived in New York City aboard the on 9 February 1952. They moved to Indiana, and later settled in the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills, Ohio. There he became a United Auto Workers (UAW) diesel engine mechanic at the nearby Ford automobile factory, where a friend from Regensburg had found work. His wife found work at a General Electric facility, and the two had two more children. On 14 November 1958, Demjanjuk became a naturalized citizen of the United States and legally changed his name from Ivan to John.

==Loss of US citizenship and extradition to Israel==
===Investigation by INS and OSI===
In 1975, Michael Hanusiak, the American editor of &quot;Ukrainian News&quot;, presented US Senator Jacob Javits of New York with a list of 70 ethnic Ukrainians living in the United States who were suspected of having collaborated with Germans in World War II; Javits sent the list to US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Its investigation reduced the list to nine individuals, including Demjanjuk. Hanusiak claimed that Soviet newspapers and archives had provided the names during his visit to Kyiv in 1974; however, INS suspected that Hanusiak, a member of the Communist Party USA, had received the list from the KGB. It chose to investigate the names as leads. Hanusiak claimed that Demjanjuk had been a guard at Sobibor concentration and death camp. INS quickly discovered that Demjanjuk had listed his place of domicile from 1937 to 1943 as Sobibor on his US visa application of 1951. This was considered circumstantial corroboration of Hanusiak&#x27;s claims, but its agents were unable to find witnesses in the US who could identify Demjanjuk.

INS sent photographs to the Israeli government of the nine persons alleged by Hanusiak to have been involved in crimes against Jews: the government&#x27;s agents asked survivors of Sobibor and Treblinka if they could identify Demjanjuk based on his visa application picture. While none recognized the name Ivan Demjanjuk, and no survivors of Sobibor identified his photograph, nine survivors of Treblinka identified Demjanjuk as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;, so named because of his cruelty as a guard operating the gas chamber at Treblinka. Lawyers at the US Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in the Department of Justice valued the identifications made by these survivors, as they had interacted with and seen &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; over a protracted period of time. They also gained an additional identification of the visa photo as Demjanjuk by Otto Horn, a former SS guard at Treblinka.

In August 1977, the Justice Department submitted a request to the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to revoke Demjanjuk&#x27;s citizenship, based on his concealment on his 1951 immigration application of having worked at Nazi death camps. While the government was preparing for trial, Hanusiak published pictures of an ID card identifying Demjanjuk as having been a Trawniki man and guard at Sobibor in &quot;News from Ukraine&quot;. Given that eyewitnesses attested to Demjanjuk having been Ivan the Terrible at Treblinka decades before, whereas documentary evidence seemed to indicate that he had served at Sobibor with little notoriety, OSI considered dropping the proceeding against Demjanjuk to focus on higher profile cases. But OSI&#x27;s new director Allan Ryan chose to go ahead with the prosecution of Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible. In 1979, three guards from Sobibor gave sworn depositions that they knew Demjanjuk to have been a guard there, and two identified his photograph. OSI did not submit these depositions into evidence and took them as a further indication that Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible, though none of the guards mentioned Demjanjuk having been at Treblinka.

===Deportation and extradition proceedings===
The proceeding opened with the prosecution calling historian Earl F. Ziemke, who reconstructed the situation on the Eastern Front in 1942 and showed that it would have been possible for Demjanjuk to have been captured at the Battle of Kerch and arrive in Trawniki that same year.
The authenticity of the Trawniki card was affirmed by US government experts who examined the original document as well as by Wolfgang Scheffler of the Free University of Berlin during the hearing, Scheffler also testified to the crimes committed by Trawniki men and that it was possible that Demjanjuk had been moved between Sobibor and Treblinka. Additionally, the former paymaster at Trawniki, Heinrich Schaefer, stated in a deposition that such cards were standard issue at Trawniki. Five Holocaust survivors from Treblinka identified Demjanjuk as having been at Treblinka and having been &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. Additionally, OSI submitted the testimony of former SS guard Horn identifying Demjanjuk as having been at Treblinka.

Although Demjanjuk&#x27;s Trawniki card only documented that he had been at Sobibor, the prosecution argued that he could have shuttled between the camps and that Treblinka had been omitted due to administrative sloppiness. During the trial, Demjanjuk admitted to having lied on his US visa application but claimed that it was out of fear of being returned to the Soviet Union and denied having been a concentration camp guard. Demjanjuk instead claimed to have been a German prisoner who completed forced labor. The defense also submitted the statement of Feodor Fedorenko, a Ukrainian guard at Treblinka, which stated that Fedorenko could not recall having seen Demjanjuk at Treblinka. Demjanjuk&#x27;s citizenship was revoked in 1981 for having lied about his past, with the judge persuaded especially by the testimony of Otto Horn. In 1982, Demjanjuk was jailed for 10 days after failing to appear for a hearing. Demjanjuk subsequently requested political asylum in the United States rather than deportation. His application for asylum was denied on 31 May 1984.

Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense was supported by the Ukrainian community and various Eastern European émigré groups; Demjanjuk&#x27;s supporters alleged that he was the victim of a communist conspiracy and raised over two million dollars for his defense. Much of the money was raised by a Cleveland-based Holocaust denier Jerome Brentar, who also recommended Demjanjuk&#x27;s lawyer Mark O&#x27;Connor. The first day of the denaturalization trial was accompanied by a protest of 150 Ukrainian-Americans who called the trial &quot;a Soviet trial in an American court&quot; and burned a Soviet flag. Demjanjuk also attracted the support of conservative political figures such as Pat Buchanan and Ohio congressman James Traficant. Others, particularly American Jews, were outraged by the presence of Demjanjuk in the United States and vocally supported his deportation. Writer Lawrence Douglas has called the case &quot;the most highly publicized denaturalization proceeding in American history.&quot;

In October 1983, Israel issued an extradition request for Demjanjuk to stand trial on Israeli soil under the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law of 1950 for crimes allegedly committed at Treblinka. In April 1985, he was detained and held at United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. Demjanjuk appealed his extradition; in a hearing on 8 July 1985, Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense attorneys claimed that the evidence against him had been manufactured by the KGB, that Demjanjuk was never at Treblinka, and that the court had no authority to consider Israel&#x27;s request for extradition. The appeals court found probable cause that Demjanjuk &quot;committed murders of uncounted numbers of prisoners&quot; and allowed the extradition to take place. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear Demjanjuk&#x27;s appeal on 25 February 1986, allowing the extradition to move forward. Demjanjuk was deported to Israel on 28 February 1986.

==Trial in Israel==

Demjanjuk&#x27;s trial took place in the Jerusalem District Court between 26 November 1986 and 18 April 1988, before a special tribunal comprising Israeli Supreme Court Judge Dov Levin and Jerusalem District Court Judges Zvi Tal and Dalia Dorner. The prosecution conceived of the trial as a didactic trial on the Holocaust in the manner of the earlier trial of Adolf Eichmann. It was the first televised trial in Israeli history. Despite initially attracting minimal attention, once survivor testimony began the trial became a &quot;national obsession&quot; and was followed widely throughout Israel and the United States. On 6 April 1987, John Stolz (or Stoltz), a 65-year-old German SS officer who had worked at a concentration camp in Poland, hanged himself in his basement in Ohio after receiving a letter from the OSI. His son Edwin said he&#x27;d been terrified of being put through the same ordeal as Demjanjuk.

===Prosecution case===
The prosecution team consisted of Israeli State Attorney Yonah Blatman, lead attorney Michael Shaked of the Jerusalem District Attorney&#x27;s Office, and the attorneys Michael Horovitz and Dennis Gouldman of the International Section of the State Attorney&#x27;s Office. According to prosecutors, Demjanjuk had been recruited into the Soviet army in 1940, and had fought until he was captured by German troops in eastern Crimea in May 1942. He was then brought to a German prisoner of war camp in Chełm in July 1942. Prosecutors claimed that Demjanjuk volunteered to collaborate with the Germans and was sent to the camp at Trawniki, where he was trained to guard prisoners as part of Operation Reinhard. The principal allegation was that three former prisoners identified Demjanjuk as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; of Treblinka, who operated the petrol engines sending gas to the death chamber. The prosecution alleged that Demjanjuk had listed Sobibor on his US immigration application in an attempt to cover up his presence at Treblinka.

Prosecutors based part of these allegations on an ID card referred to as the &quot;Trawniki card&quot;. Because the Soviet Union generally refused to cooperate with the Israeli prosecutions, this ID card was obtained from the USSR and provided to Israel by American industrialist Armand Hammer, a close associate of several Kremlin leaders, whose help had been requested by the personal appeal of Israeli president Shimon Peres. The defense claimed that the card was forged by Soviet authorities to discredit Demjanjuk. The card had Demjanjuk&#x27;s photograph, which he identified as his picture at the time. The prosecution called expert witnesses to testify on the authenticity of the card including its signatures by various Nazi officers, paper, and ink. The defense used some evidence supplied by the Soviets to support their case while calling other pieces of evidence supplied by the Soviets &quot;forgeries&quot;.

The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Holocaust survivors to establish that Demjanjuk had been at Treblinka, five of whom were put on the stand. Four of the survivors who had originally identified Demjanjuk&#x27;s photograph had died before the trial began. The testimony of one of these witnesses, Pinhas Epstein, had been barred as unreliable in US denaturalization trial of former camp guard Feodor Fedorenko, while another, Gustav Boraks, sometimes appeared confused on the stand. The most important of these was Eliyahu Rosenberg. Asked by the prosecution if he recognized Demjanjuk, Rosenberg asked that the defendant remove his glasses &quot;so I can see his eyes&quot;. Rosenberg approached and peered closely at Demjanjuk&#x27;s face. When Demjanjuk smiled and offered his hand, Rosenberg recoiled and shouted &quot;Grozny!&quot;, meaning &quot;Terrible&quot; in Polish and Russian. Rosenberg stated: &quot;Ivan, I say it unhesitatingly, without the slightest shadow of a doubt. It is Ivan from Treblinka, from the gas chambers, the man I am looking at now.&quot; Rosenberg further told the court, glaring at Demjanjuk, &quot;I saw his eyes, I saw those murderous eyes.&quot; Rosenberg then exclaimed directly to Demjanjuk: &quot;How dare you put out your hand, murderer that you are!&quot; It was later learned that Rosenberg had previously testified in a 1947 deposition that &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; had been killed in 1943 during a Treblinka prisoner uprising. During the trial, Demjanjuk was again identified on the photo spread by Otto Horn, a former German SS guard at Treblinka.

Other controversial evidence included Demjanjuk&#x27;s tattoo. Demjanjuk admitted the scar under his armpit was an SS blood group tattoo, which he removed after the war, as did many SS men to avoid summary execution by the Soviets. The blood group tattoo was applied by army medics and used by combat personnel in the Waffen-SS and its foreign volunteers and conscripts because they were likely to need blood or give transfusions. There is no evidence that POWs trained as police auxiliaries at Trawniki were required to receive such tattoos, although it was an option for those that volunteered.

===Defense case and Demjanjuk&#x27;s testimony===
Demjanjuk was at first represented by attorney Mark J. O&#x27;Connor of New York State; Demjanjuk fired him in July 1987 just a week before he was scheduled to testify at his trial. In his place, Demjanjuk hired Israeli trial lawyer whom O&#x27;Connor had hired as co-counsel. Sheftel focused the defense largely on the claim that Demjanjuk&#x27;s Trawniki card was a KGB forgery. Most significantly, Sheftel called Dr. Julius Grant, who had proven that the Hitler diaries were forged. Grant testified that the document had been forged. He also called Dutch psychologist Willem Albert Wagenaar, who testified to flaws in the method by which Treblinka survivors had identified Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible. Additionally, Sheftel alleged that the trial was a show trial, and referred to the trial as &quot;the Demjanjuk affair&quot;, alluding to the famous antisemitic Dreyfus Affair.

Demjanjuk testified during the trial that he was imprisoned in a camp in Chełm until 1944, when he was transferred to another camp in Austria, where he remained until he joined an anti-Soviet Ukrainian army group. Demjanjuk had not mentioned Chelm in his initial depositions in the United States, first referring to Chelm during his denaturalization trial in 1981. As Chelm was Demjanjuk&#x27;s alibi, he was questioned about this omission during the trial by both the prosecutors and the judges; Demjanjuk blamed the trauma of his POW experience and said he had simply forgotten. Demjanjuk also denied having known how to drive a truck in 1943, despite having stated this on his application for refugee assistance in 1948; Demjanjuk alleged that he had not filled out the form himself and the clerk must have misunderstood him. Demjanjuk&#x27;s denial related both to the supposed operation of a truck&#x27;s diesel engine by &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; for the gas chamber at Treblinka and to the SS&#x27;s singling out of Ukrainians with experience driving trucks as Trawniki men. Demjanjuk changed his testimony as to why he had listed Sobibor as his place of domicile from his earlier trials; he now claimed to have been advised to do so by an official of the United Nations Relief Administration to list a place in Poland or Czechoslovakia in order to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union, after which another Soviet refugee waiting with him suggested Demjanjuk list Sobibor. Demjanjuk also said, &quot;Your Honors, if I had really been in that terrible place, would I have been stupid enough to say so?&quot;

Demjanjuk further claimed that in 1944 he was drafted into an anti-Soviet Russian military organization, the Russian Liberation Army (Vlasov Army), funded by the Nazi German government, until the surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allies in 1945. Following closing statements, the defense submitted the statement of Ignat Danilchenko, information which had been obtained through the US Freedom of Information but had not previously been made available to the defense by OSI. Danilchenko was a former guard at Sobibor and had been deposed by the Soviet Union in 1979 at the request of the OSI (US Office of Special Investigations). Danilchenko identified Demjanjuk from three separate photo spreads as having been an &quot;experienced and reliable&quot; guard at Sobibor and that Demjanjuk had been transferred to Flossenbürg, where he had received an SS blood-type tattoo; Danilchenko did not mention Treblinka. Through Baltic émigré supporters living in Washington, D.C., the defense was also able to acquire internal OSI notes that had been thrown in a dumpster without shredding that showed that Otto Horn had in fact had difficulty identifying Demjanjuk and had been prompted to make the identification.

===Verdict and Israeli Supreme Court reversal===
On 18 April 1988, the Jerusalem District Court found Demjanjuk &quot;unhesitatingly and with utter conviction&quot; guilty of all charges and of being &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. One week later, it sentenced him to death by hanging. Demjanjuk was placed in solitary confinement during the appeals process. While there, carpenters began building the gallows that would be used to hang him if his appeals were rejected, and Demjanjuk heard the construction from his cell.

On 29 July 1993, a five-judge panel of the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict on appeal. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court&#x27;s rulings on the authenticity of the Trawniki card and the falsity of Demjanjuk&#x27;s alibi but ruled that reasonable doubt existed that Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible. The judges agreed that Demjanjuk most likely served as a Nazi &quot;Wachmann&quot; (guard) in the Trawniki unit, and had been posted at Sobibor extermination camp and two other camps. Evidence to assist this claim included an identification card from Trawniki bearing Demjanjuk&#x27;s picture and personal information,⁠ which was found in the Soviet archives, in addition to German documents that mentioned &quot;Wachmann&quot; Demjanjuk with his date and place of birth. The Trawniki certificate also implied that Demjanjuk had served at Sobibor, as did the German orders of March 1943 posting his Trawniki unit to the area. The court declined to find him guilty on this basis because the prosecution had built its entire case around Demjanjuk&#x27;s identity with Ivan the Terrible, and Demjanjuk had not been given a chance to defend himself from charges of being a guard at Sobibor.

The judge&#x27;s acquittal of Demjanjuk for being Ivan the Terrible was based on the written statements of 37 former guards at Treblinka that identified Ivan the Terrible as &quot;Ivan Marchenko&quot;. The former guards&#x27; statements were obtained after World War II by the Soviets, who prosecuted USSR citizens who had assisted the Nazis as auxiliary forces during the war. Most of the guards were executed after the war by the Soviets, and their written statements were not obtained by Israeli authorities until 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed. Central to the new evidence was a photograph of Ivan the Terrible and a description that did not match the 1942 appearance of Demjanjuk. The accounts of 21 guards who were tried in the Soviet Union on war crimes gave details that differentiate Demjanjuk from Ivan the Terriblein particular that the surname of &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; was &quot;Marchenko&quot;, not &quot;Demjanjuk&quot;. One described Ivan the Terrible as having brown hair, hazel eyes and a large scar down to his neck; Demjanjuk was blond with grayish-blue eyes and no such scar. US officials had originally been aware, without informing Demjanjuk&#x27;s attorneys, of the testimony of two of these German guards; however, the Israeli justices observed that Demjanjuk had incorrectly listed his mother&#x27;s maiden name as &quot;Marchenko&quot; in his 1951 application for US visa. Demjanjuk said he just wrote a common Ukrainian surname after he forgot his mother&#x27;s real name (&quot;Tabachyk&quot;).

===Post-acquittal===
Demjanjuk&#x27;s acquittal was met with outrage in Israel, including threats against the justices&#x27; lives. Simon Wiesenthal, an iconic figure in Nazi-hunting, first believed Demjanjuk was guilty; after Demjanjuk&#x27;s acquittal by the Israeli Supreme Court, he said he also would have cleared him given the new evidence. In Ukraine, Demjanjuk was viewed as a national hero and received a personal invitation to return to Ukraine by then-president Leonid Kravchuk. After Demjanjuk&#x27;s acquittal, the Israeli Attorney General decided to release him rather than to pursue charges of committing crimes at Sobibor. Ten petitions against the decision were made to the Supreme Court. On 18 August 1993, the court rejected the petitions on the grounds that
# the principle of double jeopardy would be infringed,
# new charges would be unreasonable given the seriousness of those of which he had been acquitted,
# conviction on the new charges would be unlikely, and
# Demjanjuk was extradited from the United States specifically to stand trial for offenses attributed to Ivan the Terrible of Treblinka, and not for other alternative charges.

During the trial, the prosecution argued that Demjanjuk should be tried for crimes at Sobibor; however, Justice Aharon Barak was not convinced, stating, &quot;We know nothing about him at Sobibor.&quot; Demjanjuk was released to return to the United States. His return was met by protests and counter-protests, with supporters including members of the Ku Klux Klan. Even before his acquittal by the Israeli Supreme Court, the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had opened an investigation into whether OSI had withheld evidence from the defense. The investigation charged that OSI had ignored evidence indicating that Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible, and uncovered an internal OSI memo that questioned the case against Demjanjuk. After Demjanjuk&#x27;s acquittal in Israel, the panel of judges on the Sixth Circuit ruled against OSI for having committed fraud on the court and having failed to provide exculpatory evidence to Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense.

==Second loss of US citizenship and extradition to Germany==

On 20 February 1998, Judge Paul Matia of the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio vacated Demjanjuk&#x27;s denaturalization &quot;without prejudice,&quot; meaning that OSI could seek to strip Demjanjuk of citizenship a second time. OSI continued to investigate Demjanjuk, relying solely on documentary evidence rather than eye-witnesses. These documents were found in former Soviet archives in Moscow and in Lithuania, which placed Demjanjuk at Sobibor on 26 March 1943, at Flossenbürg on 1 October 1943, and at Majdanek from November 1942 through early March 1943; administrative documents from Flossenbürg referencing Demjanjuk&#x27;s name and Trawniki card number were also uncovered. On 19 May 1999, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Demjanjuk to seek his denaturalization. The complaint alleged that Demjanjuk served as a guard at the Sobibór and Majdanek camps in Poland under German occupation and as a member of an SS death&#x27;s head battalion at Flossenbürg. The complaint relied on evidence compiled by historians Charles W. Sydnor Jr. and Todd Huebner, who compared Demjanjuk&#x27;s Trawniki card to 40 other known cards and found that issues on the card that had fueled suspicions of fraud were in fact typical of Trawniki&#x27;s poor record keeping.

In February 2002, Judge Matia revoked Demjanjuk&#x27;s US citizenship. Matia ruled that Demjanjuk had not produced any credible evidence of his whereabouts during the war and that the Justice Department had proved its case against him. Demjanjuk appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which on 30 April 2004 ruled that Demjanjuk could be again stripped of his US citizenship because the Justice Department had presented &quot;clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence&quot; of Demjanjuk&#x27;s service in Nazi death camps. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal in November 2004.

On 28 December 2005, an immigration judge ordered Demjanjuk deported to Germany, Poland or Ukraine. In an attempt to avoid deportation, Demjanjuk sought protection under the United Nations Convention against Torture, claiming that he would be prosecuted and tortured if he were deported to Ukraine. Chief US Immigration Judge Michael Creppy ruled there was no evidence to substantiate Demjanjuk&#x27;s claim that he would be mistreated if he were sent to Ukraine. On 22 December 2006, the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the deportation order. On 30 January 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied Demjanjuk&#x27;s request for review. On 19 May 2008, the US Supreme Court denied Demjanjuk&#x27;s petition for certiorari, declining to hear his case against the deportation order. The Supreme Court&#x27;s denial of review meant that the order of removal was final; no other appeal was possible.

One month after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s refusal to hear Demjanjuk&#x27;s case, on 19 June 2008, Germany announced it would seek the extradition of Demjanjuk to Germany. The file on Demjanjuk was compiled by Germany&#x27;s Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes. On 10 November 2008, German federal prosecutor Kurt Schrimm directed prosecutors to file in Munich for extradition, since Demjanjuk once lived there. On 9 December 2008, a German federal court declared that Demjanjuk could be tried for his role in the Holocaust. Some three months later, on 11 March 2009, Demjanjuk was charged with more than 29,000 counts of accessory to murder of Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor extermination camp. The German foreign ministry announced on 2 April 2009 that Demjanjuk would be transferred to Germany the following week, and would face trial beginning 30 November 2009.

On 2 April 2009, Demjanjuk filed a motion in an immigration trial court in Virginia. The motion sought to reopen the matter of the removal order against him; that order of removal had been originally issued by an immigration court in 2005, had been upheld by the BIA on administrative appeal in late 2006, and was further upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; after these two appeals, the US Supreme Court had, as noted above, denied any review. On 3 April 2009, US Immigration Judge Wayne Iskra temporarily stayed Demjanjuk&#x27;s deportation; Iskrka reversed himself on 6 April. As the US government noted, a motion to reopen, such as Demjanjuk&#x27;s, could only properly be filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in Washington, D.C., and not an immigration trial court. The issuance of the stay by the immigration trial court was therefore improper, as that court had no jurisdiction over the matter. Accordingly, Demjanjuk re-filed his motion to reopen, and for an attendant stay, with the BIA. On 10 April, the BIA found there was &quot;little likelihood of success that [Demjanjuk&#x27;s] pending motion to re-open the case will be granted&quot; and accordingly denied his motion for a stay pending the disposition of his motion to reopen. This removed any obstacles to federal agents seizing him for deportation to Germany.

On 14 April 2009, immigration agents removed Demjanjuk from his home in preparation for deportation. The same day, Demjanjuk&#x27;s son filed a motion in the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit asking that the deportation be stayed, which was subsequently granted. The US government argued that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which denied the stay. Demjanjuk later won a last-minute stay of deportation, shortly after US immigration agents carried him from his home in a wheelchair to face trial in Germany. The BIA denied Demjanjuk&#x27;s motion to reopen his deportation case. On 1 May 2009, the Sixth Circuit lifted the stay that it had imposed against Demjanjuk&#x27;s deportation order. On 7 May 2009, the US Supreme Court, via Justice John Paul Stevens, declined to consider Demjanjuk&#x27;s case for review, thereby denying Demjanjuk any further stay of deportation. Demjanjuk had sued Germany on 30 April 2009 to try to block the German government&#x27;s agreement to accept Demjanjuk from the US. The German Administrative Court rejected Demjanjuk&#x27;s claim on 6 May. Demjanjuk was deported to Germany, leaving Cleveland, Ohio, on 11 May, to arrive in Munich on 12 May. Upon his arrival, he was arrested and sent to Munich&#x27;s Stadelheim prison.

==Trial in Germany==
On 3 July 2009, prosecutors deemed Demjanjuk fit to stand trial. On 13 July 2009, prosecutors charged him with 27,900 counts of accessory to murder for his time as a guard at Sobibor. Demjanjuk was tried without any connection to a concrete act of murder or cruelty but rather on the theory that as a guard at Sobibor he was &quot;per se&quot; guilty of murder, a novelty in the German justice system that was seen as risky for the prosecution. Some 35 plaintiffs were admitted to file in the case, including four survivors of the Sobibor concentration camp and 26 relatives of victims. The indictment made almost no mention of Demjanjuk&#x27;s service at Majdanek or Flossenbürg, as these were not extermination camps.

Demjanjuk was represented by German attorneys Ulrich Busch and Günther Maul. The defense argued that Demjanjuk had never been a guard but that, had he been one, he would have had no choice in the matter. Busch alleged that the German justice system was prejudiced against his client, and that the entire trial was therefore illegitimate. Busch also alleged that the trial violated the principle of double jeopardy due to the previous trial in Israel. According to Munich state prosecutor Anton Winkler Doctors, restricted the time Demjanjuk could be tried in court each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each. On 30 November 2009, Demjanjuk&#x27;s trial, expected to last for several months, began in Munich. Demjanjuk arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair pushed by a German police officer. Because of the long pauses between trial dates and cancellations caused by the alleged health problems of the defendant and his defense attorney Busch&#x27;s use of many legal motions, the trial eventually stretched to eighteen months.

On 14 April 2010, Anton Dallmeyer, an expert witness, testified that the typeset and handwriting on an ID card being used as key evidence matched four other ID cards believed to have been issued at the SS training camp at Trawniki. Demjanjuk&#x27;s lawyer argued that all of the ID cards could be forgeries and that there was no point comparing them. The prosecution also produced orders to a man identified as Demjanjuk to go to Sobibor and other records to show that Demjanjuk had served as a guard there. Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense team argued that these documents were Soviet forgeries. As part of the prosecution&#x27;s case, historian Dieter Pohl of the University of Klagenfurt testified that Sobibor was a death camp, the sole purpose of which was the killing of Jews, and that all Trawniki men had been generalists involved in guarding the prisoners as well as other duties; therefore, if Demjanjuk was a Trawniki man at Sobibor, he had necessarily been involved in sending the prisoners to their deaths and was an accessory to murder. The prosecution further argued, using Pohl&#x27;s testimony, firstly that Demjanjuk&#x27;s choice after being captured by the Germans was guard duty or forced labor, not death, secondly that the Trawniki guards were a privileged group that was essential to the Holocaust, and finally that Demjanjuk&#x27;s failure to desert, something many Trawniki guards did, showed that he had been at Sobibor voluntarily.

On 24 February 2010, a witness for the prosecution, Alex Nagorny, who agreed to serve the Nazi Germans after his capture, testified that he knew Demjanjuk from his time as a guard. When asked to identify Demjanjuk in the courtroom, Nagorny was unable to, stating: &quot;That&#x27;s definitely not him – no resemblance.&quot; As Nagorny had previously identified Demjanjuk from his US visa application photo, his inability to recognize Demjanjuk in the courtroom was seen as incongruous. Demjanjuk declined to testify or make a final statement during the trial; however, he delivered three written declarations to the court that alleged that his prosecution was caused by a conspiracy between the OSI, the World Jewish Congress, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, while continuing to allege that the KGB had forged the documents used. In his third declaration, Demjanjuk demanded access to a secret KGB file numbered 1627 and declared a hunger strike until he got it.

On 15 January 2011, Spain requested a European arrest warrant be issued for Nazi war crimes against Spaniards; the request was refused for a lack of evidence. On 12 May 2011, aged 91, Demjanjuk was convicted as an accessory to the murder of 28,060 Jews at Sobibor killing center and sentenced to five years in prison with two years already served. Presiding Judge Ralph Alt ordered Demjanjuk released from custody pending his appeal, as he did not appear to pose a flight-risk. This was the first time someone has been convicted by a German court solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of being involved in the death of any specific inmate. His release pending appeal was protested by some, including Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

==Death and posthumous efforts to restore US citizenship==
John Demjanjuk died at a home for the elderly in Bad Feilnbach, Germany, on 17 March 2012, aged 91. As a consequence of his appeal not having been heard, Demjanjuk is still presumed innocent under German law. In early June 2012, Ulrich Busch, Demjanjuk&#x27;s attorney, filed a complaint with Bavarian prosecutors claiming that the pain medication Novalgin (known in the US as metamizole or dipyrone) that had been administered to Demjanjuk helped lead to his death. The investigation was closed in November 2012 after no evidence emerged to support the allegations.

Following his death, his relatives requested that he be buried in the United States, where he once lived. Jewish organizations have opposed this, claiming that his burial site would become a center for neo-Nazi activity. On 31 March 2012, it was reported that Demjanjuk was buried at an undisclosed US location. On 12 April 2012, Demjanjuk&#x27;s attorneys filed a suit to posthumously restore his US citizenship. On 28 June 2012, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled that Demjanjuk could not regain his citizenship posthumously. On 11 September 2012, the court denied Demjanjuk&#x27;s request to have the appeal reheard &quot;en banc&quot; by the full court.

==Legacy==
The 1989 film &quot;Music Box&quot;, directed by Costa-Gavras, is based in part on the Demjanjuk case. Author Philip Roth, who briefly attended the Demjanjuk trial in Israel, portrays a fictionalized version of Demjanjuk and his trial in the 1993 novel &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;. In 2019, Netflix released &quot;The Devil Next Door&quot;, a documentary by Israeli filmmakers Daniel Sivan and Yossi Bloch that focuses on Demjanjuk&#x27;s trial in Israel.

===Subsequent prosecutions of Nazi extermination camp guards in Germany ===
Demjanjuk&#x27;s conviction for accessory to murder solely on the basis of having been a guard at a concentration camp set a new legal precedent in Germany. Prior to Demjanjuk&#x27;s trial, the requirement that prosecutors find a specific act of murder to charge guards with had resulted in a very low conviction rate for death camp guards. Following Demjanjuk&#x27;s conviction, however, Germany began aggressively prosecuting former death camp guards. In 2015, former Auschwitz guard Oskar Gröning was convicted on the same legal argument as Demjanjuk; his conviction was upheld on appeal, solidifying the precedent made by the Demjanjuk case. In 2019, German prosecutors charged guards at a concentration camp—as opposed to a death camp—on the same rationale for the first time: former Stutthof concentration camp guards Johann Rehbogen and .

===Publication of photographs from Sobibor===
In January 2020, the Topography of Terror Foundation in Berlin announced that they were about to exhibit and publish a collection of 361 photographs taken by Johann Niemann over the course of his career, including from his time as deputy commandant of Sobibor, which had been made newly available by his descendants. They believe the collection includes two photos showing Demjanjuk with fellow guards at the camp, which would be the first documentary evidence to conclusively establish he had served there.

On 20 January 2020, the day after the announcement, the Ludwigsburg Research Center qualified it by saying it is likely that one of the men in the noted photos is Demjanjuk but that this cannot be said &quot;with absolute certainty&quot; (), given the time that had passed since they were taken. Niemann was killed there on 14 October 1943 during a prisoner revolt. The photographs were published on 28 January 2020 in the book &quot;Fotos aus Sobibor&quot; (&quot;Photos from Sobibor&quot;). The Niemann family has donated the originals to the collection of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which has digitized this collection for research.

<doc id="217252" wikidata="Q1315167" url="?curid=217252" title="Jimmy Kimmel Live!">
<text>Jimmy Kimmel Live!, sometimes shortened to JKL, is an American late-night talk show, created and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, and broadcast on ABC. The nightly hour-long show tapes and is based out of the Hollywood Masonic Temple in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. It debuted on January 26, 2003 as part of ABC&#x27;s lead-out programming for Super Bowl XXXVII. For its first ten years, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; aired at either the midnight or 12:05 a.m. ET/PT before moving to 11:35 p.m. on January 8, 2013. Despite its name, the show has not regularly aired live since April 23, 2004, when censors were unable to properly bleep censor a barrage of swearing from actor Thomas Jane.

&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; is produced by Kimmelot in association with 20th Television. It holds the title as the longest running late-night talk show on the network, having aired for more than three times as long as either &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; (1969–1975) or &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; (1997–2002).

==History==
After &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; was cancelled in 2002, ABC decided to create a talk show following &quot;Nightline&quot;. Kimmel, who had co-hosted Comedy Central sketch comedy show &quot;The Man Show&quot; was in negotiations as host in May 2002 and was publicly announced in November. The show premiered on January 26, 2003. Because &quot;Nightline&quot; traditionally began at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (and &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; before it) originally started after midnight.

&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; is ABC&#x27;s first attempt at a traditional late-night talk show since its attempt to revive &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in the 1980s. ABC had earlier attempted to directly compete with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s with &quot;The Les Crane Show&quot;, which was more of a serious interview program than light entertainment, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; (1967–1969), featuring Rat Pack member Joey Bishop with Regis Philbin as sidekick, the original &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot; (1969–1975) with Dick Cavett in a show that featured a mixture of cultural, popular entertainment and intellectual figures and was considered more highbrow than Carson and even a short-lived revival of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; under the name &quot;Jack Paar Tonite&quot;, which alternated weeks with Cavett in 1973. While Cavett was the longest-lasting and best remembered of these attempts, none seriously threatened the domination of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;.

&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; was stunted early on by an ABC affiliate body which was fulfilling existing syndication contracts for post-local news sitcom repeats and entertainment newsmagazines and thus delaying the show (and making the &quot;Live!&quot; title somewhat of a misnomer), started behind the ratings of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&quot; &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn,&quot; but gradually moved up in the ratings into 2004, and became a fairly strong competitor, capturing about half the audience of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.&quot;

&quot;Nightline&quot;, which premiered in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis, was able to compete with the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, particularly on days when there were major news events or ongoing crises. The growth and development of cable news and the emergence of the internet and the 24-hour news cycle eroded &quot;Nightline&quot;″s originally unique, and later preeminent position as a source for late evening national and international news and its value as a counterprogramming against &quot;Tonight&quot; and other late-night talk shows. As a result, on January 8, 2013, &quot;Nightline&quot; switched places on ABC&#x27;s schedule with &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. Since then, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; at 11:35 p.m. has been able to more directly compete with the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot;.

Following the subsequent retirements of Jay Leno in February 2014, David Letterman in May 2015, and Jon Stewart in August 2015, Kimmel became the third-longest serving current host in late-night television after Conan O&#x27;Brien and Bill Maher. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s show ended in 2021, making Kimmel the second-longest-tenured host after Maher.

On April 14, 2009, after the March sweeps break, &quot;Kimmel&quot; began broadcasting in 720p high definition.

&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; increasingly became political satire during the mid-2010s after Donald Trump ran for President of the United States. Kimmel cited issues close to him including his son’s congenital heart defect and health insurance.

On August 15, 2019, ABC and the show were fined $395,000 via a settlement by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for misusing the Emergency Alert System (EAS) tone on the October 3, 2018, episode.

At the start of 2019, when Hearst Television&#x27;s newest affiliation agreement for their ABC affiliates kicked in and forced them to give up their ability to delay the program for extended local newscasts or syndicated programming, the show now airs across the network on most stations at 11:35 p.m. ET/10:35 p.m. CT.

In May 2019, Kimmel and ABC agreed to extend his contract to host the show until 2022, which would be the show&#x27;s twentieth season.

On March 16, 2020, the show suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two weeks later, on March 30, the show resumed production from Kimmel&#x27;s house, resuming its original 12:05 a.m. timeslot; &quot;Nightline&quot; returned to 11:35 p.m. On April 13, episodes were reduced to 30 minutes in length. &quot;Nightline&quot; moved to 12:05 a.m., followed by an encore of the 11:35 p.m. show.

On June 18, 2020, Kimmel announced he was taking a hiatus from the show; a series of guest hosts filled in with 30-minute episodes until he returned with the new television season after hosting the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. This has since become a yearly tradition for the show&#x27;s July and August shows under the more traditional hour format.

On September 21, 2020, Kimmel returned to the show, which also resumed taping from the Hollywood Masonic Temple without a studio audience, the show also resumed its 60-minute format, with &quot;Nightline&quot; returning to 12:35 a.m. In January 2021, pursuant to guidance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works due to a local increase in cases, the show briefly returned to its at-home format. The show has since returned to a full audience as restrictions were lifted, with the requirement that attendees have their full vaccinations.

On February 21, 2024, Kimmel hinted that he may not renew his contract for further seasons after his current contract expires in 2026 in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, stating that &quot;I think this is my final contract, I hate to even say it, because everyone&#x27;s laughing at me now — each time I think that, and then it turns out to be not the case. I still have a little more than two years left on my contract, and that seems pretty good, that seems like enough.&quot;

==Production==
Contrary to its name, &quot;Kimmel&quot; has not aired live editions regularly since 2004; instead, it is recorded at 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time (7:30 p.m. Eastern) on the day of broadcast outside special episodes. The program switched to taped broadcasts after actor Thomas Jane guested and standards and practices was unable to easily bleep censor a sudden barrage of profanity from Jane to test their limits.

Until 2009, new episodes aired five nights a week, while from 2009 to 2012, the Friday episode was a rebroadcast of a recent episode. Starting with the January 2013 move, the Friday episode was retitled &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live! This Week,&quot; showing highlights from the entire week of shows. However, the show has since reverted to airing a rebroadcast of a recent episode on Fridays, although current events have caused the show to occasionally air new Friday episodes.

On January 8, 2025, it was announced that &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; would suspend production due to the ongoing wildfires in the Southern California region, where El Capitan, the filming spot for the show, is located. On January 13, it was announced that the show would resume production at El Capitan effective immediately.

===Talent===
The show&#x27;s house band is Cleto and the Cletones, led by saxophonist Cleto Escobedo III, a childhood friend of Kimmel. The other &quot;Cletones&quot; of the band are Cleto Escobedo Jr., the bandleader&#x27;s father, on tenor and alto saxophone, Jeff Babko on keyboards, Toshi Yanagi on guitar, Jimmy Earl on bass, and Jonathan Dresel on drums. Like other talk shows with live bands, Cleto and the Cletones play the show&#x27;s opening and closing themes and play into and out of commercial breaks. (They usually play through the entire break for the studio audience.) The show&#x27;s opening theme was written by Les Pierce, Jonathan Kimmel and Cleto Escobedo III and sung by Robert Goulet.

The show originally had guest co-hosts each week who would sit at the desk with Kimmel and participate in skits and questioning each night&#x27;s guests. Parking lot security guard Guillermo Rodriguez became the sidekick of the show after he was caught sleeping in announcer Dicky Barrett’s car.

The show also featured guest announcers, until comedian Andy Milonakis took over as the show&#x27;s announcer from late 2003 to 2004. He would also appear in comedy bits for the show. Then in 2004, Mighty Mighty Bosstones &amp; The Defiant (band) singer Dicky Barrett took over as the show&#x27;s announcer when the Bosstones went on hiatus. The band has since become active again, and performed live on the show in 2009.
 Since its inception, stand-up comedian Don Barris has performed as the warmup comic for the in-studio audience, although he rarely appears on camera; before joining JKL, Barris was the warmup comic for &quot;The Man Show&quot;.

Francis &quot;Uncle Frank&quot; Potenza, Kimmel&#x27;s real-life uncle, served as a security guard for the show, and appeared regularly in bits on-camera with Kimmel and other employees of the show. He was a New York City police officer and a personal security guard for Frank Sinatra. Potenza did not appear regularly from December 2009 through March 2010, due to illness. (In the interim, he did appear on the seventh anniversary show on January 26, 2010.) However, he later returned as a semi-regular. Potenza died on August 23, 2011, at the age of 77. Veatrice Rice was another parking lot security guard who had several of her own segments on the show until her death from cancer on January 21, 2009.

===Kimmel and Matt Damon===

Frequently at the end of the show, Kimmel thanks the guests as usual, but then adds, &quot;Our apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time.&quot; Damon himself told &quot;Parade&quot; magazine in 2011 that Kimmel said he first did it at a low moment at the end of a show which had substandard guests. The show&#x27;s producer liked the joke, and Kimmel continued to do it on subsequent shows for their amusement. During a 2013 appearance on the radio talk show &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, Kimmel further stated that he only chose Damon&#x27;s name because it was the first A-list actor that popped into his head that &quot;we absolutely would not bump if he was on the show&quot;.

On September 12, 2006, Damon appeared on the show. A montage of clips demonstrating the numerous times Kimmel performed the bit was shown and, after a very lengthy introduction by Kimmel, Damon appeared on stage. After a few seconds, Kimmel apologized and stated that the show was out of time. He asked Damon if he could return the next night, to which Damon replied, &quot;Go f**k yourself.&quot; An infuriated Damon continued to curse at Kimmel throughout the rolling of the credits, ultimately slapping the desk and walking off the set. In the December 17, 2006, issue of &quot;USA Weekend&quot;, Kimmel acknowledged that the Damon incident was a joke. In the show which aired on June 5, 2007, Kimmel sent his sidekick Guillermo to the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; premiere to interview Damon, though when he started the interview, he said that they were out of time, at which point Damon assumed that Kimmel sent him. In the August 2, 2007, episode, Kimmel then announced that Guillermo was taking on the role of Jason Bourne, who was played by Damon, for &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;. A clip was shown in which Guillermo was playing Bourne, until Damon showed up and thought that Kimmel was now trying to bump him from his movie. Damon tried to chase Guillermo but Guillermo slapped him and jumped through a wall. In Kimmel&#x27;s 2010 post-Oscar show, he featured a clip called &quot;The Handsome Men&#x27;s Club,&quot; which ended with Damon telling Kimmel, &quot;We&#x27;re all out of time,&quot; then bursting into evil laughter after Kimmel was ejected from the club for not being handsome enough. However, it turned out to be a dream, as he wakes up next to Ben Affleck.

Damon was part of the all-star cast assembled by Kimmel for his 2012 Oscars parody, which was a mock trailer for a non-existent blockbuster called &quot;Movie: The Movie&quot;. Damon appears briefly in a full grape suit, only to be informed his scene had been cut from the &quot;film&quot; after which he is shown storming out of the studio (as part of the trailer), cursing at Kimmel. In the mock trailer for the sequel, &#x27;Movie: The Movie 2&#x27;, Damon appears again as an alien who is munching on a sandwich only to think he is munching something else. He walks out cursing Kimmel again. However, it later shown to just be a toy.

In August 2013, Guillermo crashed a Matt Damon interview, about his upcoming movie &quot;Elysium&quot;, by promoting his own movie called &quot;Estupido&quot;, about a stupid man, which poster had an arrow pointing towards Matt Damon. At the end of the interview, Matt removed the poster, revealing on the other side the name of another Guillermo movie called &quot;Ass Face&quot;, also with an arrow pointing towards Matt. Matt accuses Guillermo of acting on Kimmel&#x27;s orders and, facing the camera, starts to say &quot;you...&quot;, at which time it cuts to Guillermo&#x27;s promo which ends with Matt&#x27;s face turning into an ass.

In February 2014, Damon was invited with the cast of &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;. Damon sat in another seat. A fake fire was activated at the end of the show when Kimmel asked Damon a question.

During Kimmel&#x27;s 2016 post-Oscar special, Ben Affleck wore a very large coat for his appearance, and Damon emerged from the coat for the interview. However, he was removed from the studio by an enraged Kimmel, who then moved on to interview Affleck. Later, Damon appeared in a sketch about the movie that Affleck stars in, &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,&quot; reprising his role as astronaut Mark Watney.

When Kimmel hosted the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, he renewed his feud with Damon, first in a skit harshly criticizing Damon&#x27;s film &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;, having the announcer introduce him as only the unnamed &quot;guest&quot; of Ben Affleck, and personally conducting the orchestra to play him off while Damon was talking (before announcing the nominees and award winner).
On an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Damon praised Fallon for his speedy invitation process, which Kimmel poked fun of.

In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic when Kimmel was hosting the show from his house, Damon emerged from one of Kimmel&#x27;s bedrooms, revealing to have been there during the whole pandemic and demanded to be on the show, when Kimmel wanted to take a break. Then it was revealed Kimmel&#x27;s wife had been cheating on him with Damon again. This resulted in Kimmel telling Damon he is not on the show.

On April 1, 2022, with Jimmy Fallon hosting in place of Kimmel for April Fools&#x27; Day, Fallon announced Matt Damon as a guest on the show. Instead, Justin Timberlake emerged wearing Boston Red Sox apparel and carrying a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts coffee cup, loosely in character as Matt Damon. The interview ended with Timberlake spray painting &quot;I &lt;3 Matt Damon&quot; on the front of Kimmel&#x27;s desk.

====&quot;I&#x27;m fucking Matt Damon&quot; video====

In a segment that aired on January 31, 2008, Kimmel&#x27;s then long-time girlfriend Sarah Silverman appeared on the show and announced, via a music video, that she had been &quot;fucking Matt Damon.&quot; Damon took an additional jab at Kimmel&#x27;s long running gag by telling Kimmel at the end of the video, &quot;Jimmy, we&#x27;re out of time. Sorry.&quot;

On February 24, on Kimmel&#x27;s third post-Oscar show, he debuted his rebuttal video, announcing that he was doing the same to Ben Affleck. Kimmel introduced his star-studded musical by addressing Damon and vowing, &quot;You take something I love from me, I&#x27;m gonna take something you love from you.&quot; Affleck is Damon&#x27;s longtime acting and writing collaborator; the two first became prominent as such for &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and later channeled this collaboration into &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;.

In addition to Affleck, the video featured Robin Williams, Don Cheadle, Harrison Ford, Hynden Walch, Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, Benji Madden and Joel Madden from Good Charlotte, Dicky Barrett, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Lance Bass, Dominic Monaghan, Meat Loaf, Pete Wentz, Joan Jett, Huey Lewis, Perry Farrell, Macy Gray, Rebecca Romijn, Josh Groban, Jessica DiCicco, and unnamed choir singers as recording booth singers, along with Brad Pitt as a delivery man. The video gained widespread media attention, with Kimmel jokingly telling the &quot;New York Times,&quot; &quot;Every once in a while, Hollywood rallies itself for a worthy cause.&quot; On its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put Damon as an action star at No. 60 and the Silverman video on No. 62, writing, &quot;A talk-show host&#x27;s famous comedian girlfriend confesses in a catchy song that she&#x27;s shtupping No. 60? Yeah, that&#x27;ll go viral.&quot;

In 2008, the segment won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.

====&quot;Jimmy Kimmel Sucks!&quot;====
For the 10th anniversary episode on January 24, 2013, Damon took over hosting duties; for the occasion, the show was renamed &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Sucks!&quot; The episode began with a sequence of clips showing Kimmel &quot;bumping&quot; Damon, and continued with Damon taking command of the show, while Kimmel was tied to a chair and gagged for the remainder of the episode. Damon then replaced Guillermo with Andy Garcia and bandleader Cleto with Sheryl Crow, before bringing in Robin Williams to do the monologue.

The show had numerous guests, including Nicole Kidman, Gary Oldman, Amy Adams, Reese Witherspoon, Demi Moore, and Sarah Silverman, along with an on-screen cameo by Ben Affleck during Damon&#x27;s monologue. There were also numerous taped pieces congratulating Damon on hosting, including by Jennifer Lopez, Sally Field, John Krasinski, Robert De Niro, Don Cheadle, Oprah Winfrey, and Kimmel&#x27;s parents. Damon also &quot;revealed&quot; that Kimmel keeps &quot;bumping&quot; Damon out of jealousy: a clip shows Kimmel&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to audition for all movie roles that Damon played. At the episode&#x27;s end, Damon turns the &quot;We ran out of time&quot; joke on Kimmel after asking Kimmel if he had anything to say. The episode was the highest-rated late night show that evening, and ABC elected to rebroadcast it in primetime the following week.

===Jay Leno parody===
During the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict, Kimmel donned a gray wig and fake chin, performing his entire January 12, 2010, show in character as Jay Leno. With his bandleader, Cleto Escobedo, parodying Leno&#x27;s bandleader Kevin Eubanks, Kimmel started out his monologue with &quot;It&#x27;s good to be here on ABC. Hey, Cleto, you know what ABC stands for? Always Bump Conan.&quot; He also referenced the &quot;People of Earth&quot; letter written by Conan O&#x27;Brien, noting how O&#x27;Brien declined to participate in the &quot;destruction&quot; of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, commenting as Leno that &quot;Fortunately, though, I will! I&#x27;ll burn it down if I have to!&quot; Leno called Kimmel the next morning to discuss the bit, and at the end of the call, Leno suggested he come over and appear on his show. When his booking department called to confirm his appearance on a &quot;10 at 10&quot; segment, Kimmel agreed immediately. When he received the questions for his January 14 appearance—such as &quot;What&#x27;s your favorite snack junk food?&quot;—he realized Leno intended to neutralize the scathing parody and paint the two as friends.

Kimmel, however, was upfront with wanting to discuss the fiasco at hand, and upon his appearance, attempted to steer the questions that way: when asked about his favorite prank, he responded, &quot;I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, &#x27;Five years from now I&#x27;m going to give you my show.&#x27; And then when the five years came, I gave it to him and I took it back, almost instantly.&quot; Another example came from when Leno asked, &quot;Ever order anything off the TV?&quot; Kimmel replied, &quot;Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?&quot;

Following similar remarks to more questions, Kimmel closed the segment with this comment: &quot;Listen, Jay. Conan and I have children. All you have to take care of is cars! We have lives to lead here! You&#x27;ve got eight hundred million dollars! For God&#x27;s sakes, leave our shows alone!&quot; Leno never fought back and accepted the bit as comedy (he ascribed it as Kimmel attempting to score some publicity), but Leno&#x27;s producer, Debbie Vickers, was furious.

Kimmel discussed the appearance during an interview with Marc Maron for the latter&#x27;s podcast in 2012. Kimmel stated that he felt O&#x27;Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel&#x27;s time slot and become his lead-in.) However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, &quot;those conversations were gone,&quot; according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno&#x27;s relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt &quot;worked over,&quot; reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.

===Sets===
The stage where the show is taped has gone through many changes, from the addition of a platform in front of the stage for Kimmel to do his monologue, to various stage backgrounds. In January 2005, the show&#x27;s original set, at the TV studio in the Hollywood Masonic Temple (now known as the El Capitan Entertainment Centre), which had video screens in the background and the band performing on the left side of the stage, was replaced with the current set, which has a city in the background. The band now performs on the right side of the stage.

In the special February 25, 2007, episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; (the second &quot;After the Academy Awards&quot; show), the second set was slightly tweaked when an illustrated picture of a city, which was seen in the background from January 2005 to February 2007, was replaced with a 3D collage of Los Angeles and Hollywood (including the adjacent Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak Theatre) across from the studio where his show is broadcast from). The 3D image, which was first used during Lionel Richie&#x27;s outdoor stage performances in the September 16, 2006, episode, was created by artists Colin Cheer and Brian Walters.

A brand-new set was unveiled January 8, 2013, coinciding with the show&#x27;s move to the earlier 11:35 p.m. timeslot. The new set is similar to the previous one, though the desk and chairs are no longer a stationary set element, and are only brought out for the guest interviews. Later, the traditional city duratrans was replaced with a large floor-to-ceiling curved video display known as the &quot;Wall of America&quot;, which most of the time displays the traditional background, but is now also able to be used for video pieces and bits, along with interviews (including ones where Kimmel is not at his desk; an instance of this was an interview through Cisco&#x27;s Jabber Guest with actress Viola Davis after the first-season finale of &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; in February 2015 where she was unable to fly to Los Angeles from the East Coast due to weather issues) which are branded under Cisco Systems&#x27;s telepresence technology. The desk/chairs component of the set is also not permanently staged unlike most talk shows, being quickly built on-stage only after Kimmel has finished his monologue, skits and bits at center stage, a build-out seen every episode in a &#x27;split&#x27; commercial break where Kimmel is seen interacting with the audience during it.

===Music===
The &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live Concert Series&quot; segment comprises a musical performance at the end of the show, which is performed either in a more intimate space on the second floor of the Masonic Temple, or a nearby outdoor stage, along with rare on-location performances, and since the pandemic, more often remotely performed. the musical performance was perform by numerous musician including Slayer, Cypress Hill, Backstreet Boys, and Happa-tai from Japanese TV show, Warau Inu. Coors Light sponsored most of the show&#x27;s musical performances from 2004 to 2006. In June 2005, the show partnered with Pontiac for its concerts, which were held on the &quot;Pontiac Garage&quot; outdoor stage in Hollywood. the &quot;Pontiac Garage&quot; campaign was created Leo Burnett Worldwide for the show including The Super Bowl XL Roadtrip in a Pontiac G6, and the live advertisements to coincide with the launch of the Pontiac G8 (a rebadged Holden VE Commodore). Pontiac was sponsored for 4 years until the sponsor&#x27;s parent company, General Motors, filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and announced the termination of the brand. Beginning in October 2009, Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Bud Light (initially Bud Light Golden Wheat in 2009–10) replaced Pontiac as the segment&#x27;s sponsor. In January 2013, Sony took over sponsorship. In 2014, AT&amp;T took over sponsorship, then in 2015 Samsung replaced AT&amp;T as the segment&#x27;s sponsor, in 2016 Cîroc replaced Samsung as the segment&#x27;s sponsor and in 2017 Mercedes-Benz became the segment&#x27;s sponsor.

==Special broadcasts==
On occasion, a special live edition is broadcast, usually after major events like the Academy Awards (except in years where Kimmel has hosted the actual ceremony). From the show&#x27;s debut in 2003 until 2022, about four to seven half-hour basketball-themed broadcasts under the title &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Game Night&quot; aired at 8:00 p.m. ET (7:00 p.m. ET on Sundays) as lead-in programming to ABC&#x27;s coverage of the NBA Finals. This was discontinued in 2023 after the NBA moved up its weeknight start times (making the game and pregame show to fully air in primetime), with ABC adding special 30-minute episodes of shows on Sundays; the Kimmel shows were also made more impractical by a writers&#x27; strike entering its second month.

==Openings==
===Cold open===
When the show aired at 12:05 ET, the show began with a two-minute segment before the theme song and actual show. Originally a miniature monologue and preview of the guests, the segment expanded to include miniature skits and other ways to plug a product from one of the show&#x27;s sponsors. (These, better known as &quot;integrated commercials,&quot; are rarely repeated.) The cold open device was later adopted by &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, and it was used by James Corden for occasional segments for his version. These segments were dropped when the show moved to 11:35. For ABC&#x27;s O&amp;O stations and some affiliates, Kimmel does tape a promo introducing the night&#x27;s guests and bits meant to be bedded into a late segment of their local newscasts.

===Show opening===
The show&#x27;s original opening sequence was a fly around of Hollywood before transitioning to Kimmel entering the theater as he flips the switch from the left side. It was later changed to a stop-motion piece which showcased Kimmel in casual gear with his dry cleaning stopping at various places in Hollywood until arriving at the theater.

On October 27, 2011, the show introduced a new opening sequence that shows Kimmel zip-lining through Hollywood until he arrives at the theater.

In January 2015, the show premiered a new opening, created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The sequence begins with Kimmel turning on the lights of Los Angeles from the Hollywood sign before the background instantly changes to several locations in Los Angeles before transforming into the theater where Kimmel leads the camera in. It was later shortened with the Hollywood sign was already turned on and the background doesn&#x27;t change. In 2016, after Kimmel grew out his beard, the sequence was modified slightly to remove Kimmel&#x27;s presence.

From March to August 2020, during the time the show is filmed from his home, Kimmel&#x27;s kids created a unique opening sequence.

Starting in late September 2020, upon Kimmel&#x27;s return to the studio, a picture of the classic 1962 ABC ID, fully recreated to fit the widescreen format, alongside the animated version in the October 30, 2020 episode, was used. It was later removed in December 2022. It was previously used as a variant with the American flag being shown in the transition from 4:3 to 16:9 in the special episode, &quot;Intermission Accomplished: A Tribute to Trump&quot;. The intro has been simplified with the shot of the stage before Jimmy comes to the stage. Starting from May 2021, upon the audience returning, the simplified intro now shows the show&#x27;s logo from multiple angles, which now shows the sign being turned on after the &quot;Previously on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;&quot; segment starting in September 2023.

However, with every broadcast, the show&#x27;s announcer, Dicky Barrett, then Lou Wilson starting in 2022, consistently starts off by saying, &quot;From Hollywood, it&#x27;s Jimmy Kimmel Live! Tonight...&quot; and then listing the show&#x27;s guests. At the end of the opening, Barrett comes up with a different introduction quip after &quot;And now...&quot; every time such as &quot;without further ado...&quot; or &quot;I warned you...&quot; and finishing with saying &quot;Here&#x27;s Jimmy Kimmel!&quot; while elongating the &quot;-el&quot; sound just to give the show its own uniqueness. In the Game Night specials, Barrett doesn&#x27;t do the introduction quips and will say &quot;And now, here&#x27;s Jimmy Kimmel!&quot;. Starting from 2020, Barrett, then Wilson, with the latter being shown as he introduces Kimmel to the stage, the introduction quips were removed and will now say &quot;And now, Jimmy Kimmel!&quot;. However, from September 2020 to May 2021, Barrett would say &quot;And now, Jimmy Kimmel.&quot; to give a lighter tone to what he normally say. Originally, Andy Milonakis was the announcer.

For the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary episode, it shows an evolution of the show&#x27;s intro, which starts from the 2003 version all the way to the 2021 version, ending with the show&#x27;s current logo. The screen ratio transitioned from 4:3 to 16:9 when it gets to the 2011 version. Wilson, however, was not shown after the intro.

Starting in September 2023, the program starts with a &quot;Previously on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;&quot; segment before the title sequence, which shows a video on social media, parodying a recap segment of various drama shows. That segment would later be dropped in late February 2024.

==Notable episodes== 
* The Harrison Ford vs. Chewbacca Feud. On July 27, 2011, Ford appeared in a pre-show segment in which he is shown arguing in his dressing room with Chewbacca, his former co-star from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy over an unexplained issue apparently related to Chewbacca cheating with Ford&#x27;s wife. On April 17, 2013, during another appearance on Kimmel, Chewbacca appeared in the audience during a question-and-answer session; Ford reignited the argument regarding Chewie&#x27;s apparent dalliance with his wife, and the staged segment ended with a furious Ford &quot;storming&quot; out of the studio. Finally, on November 24, 2015, Ford settles his feud with Chewbacca by saving him from suicide, and remembering together the good old times.
* Feud with Kanye West. The rap musician launched a tirade directed at Kimmel on Twitter after a September 25, 2013, sketch involving two children re-enacting West&#x27;s recent interview with BBC Radio 1 in which he calls himself the biggest rock star on the planet. Kimmel reveals the following night that West called him to demand an apology shortly before taping. In October 2013, Kimmel had West back on the show and apologized to him.
* Kids Table China comments During the October 16, 2013, episode, Kimmel held the &quot;Kids Table&quot; segment to invite several 6–7-year-old children to discuss the U.S. debt problem: &quot;We owe the Chinese a lot of money, 1.3 trillion dollars.&quot; A boy immediately suggested to &quot;kill everyone in China.&quot; This comment elicited some laughter from the audience and Kimmel laughed it off and commented, &quot;That&#x27;s an interesting idea.&quot; He later asked, &quot;Should we allow the Chinese to live?&quot; The boy stuck to his answer. The show drew fire from offended Asian Americans and Chinese citizens. An online poll showed that 90% of the respondents were angered, saddened or guarded about the show. On October 28, 2013, Asian Americans marched through the streets of San Francisco protesting about Kimmel&#x27;s show and his supposed condoning of genocide. The clip of this segment has since been removed from Kimmel&#x27;s YouTube account, but can still be seen when viewing the entire episode.
* Back to the Future Day. On October 21, 2015, the future date featured in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd appeared as Marty McFly and &quot;Doc&quot; Emmett Brown arriving from 1985 in the DeLorean time machine, with Jimmy explaining what life in 2015 was like. Afterwards, Jimmy interviewed Fox as himself.
* Birth of William Kimmel. Returning to the show on May 1, 2017, after a hiatus, Jimmy, in his monologue, tearfully recounted the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo after it was discovered he had a congenital disease. Furthermore, the host made an impassioned plea to lawmakers in the United States government on both sides to ensure everyone has access to health care, referencing repeated efforts by Republicans in the House of Representatives to repeal the Affordable Care Act (an effort, by coincidence, House Republicans managed to reach later that week, on May 4). To care for his child, Kimmel took the rest of the week off, with guest hosts Will Arnett, Anthony Anderson, Kristen Bell and David Spade filling in. In November 2017 Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Dave Grohl, Channing Tatum and Jennifer Lawrence filled in as guest hosts for Kimmel when his son had his second heart surgery.
* No Studio Audience. On January 27, 2020, Kimmel elected to tape the show in an empty studio following the death of NBA superstar Kobe Bryant, who had appeared on the program 15 times by Kimmel&#x27;s count. An emotional Kimmel explained that he didn&#x27;t feel it was appropriate to do a comedy show under the circumstances and instead spent the hour reflecting on Bryant&#x27;s legacy.
* Guest Host Pete Buttigieg. On March 12, 2020, former Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg guest-hosted the program. Buttigieg delivered the opening monologue, interviewed actors Patrick Stewart and Tony Hale, and briefly played the keyboard. Segments included a skit in which Buttigieg applied for a new job at Wetzel&#x27;s Pretzels and a mock game show (hosted by LeVar Burton) in which he tested his knowledge of &quot;Star Trek&quot; against Stewart. (He lost.) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several crew members and Buttigieg&#x27;s husband Chasten served as the in-studio audience. This marks the first time a politician has hosted an American late night talk show. This was also the final broadcast of the show before it was shot from lockdown.
* Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon switch. On April 1, 2022, Kimmel swapped places with Jimmy Fallon as part of an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, with Fallon hosting &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and Kimmel hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in New York City. Only a small number of producers, writers and network executives were notified prior.

==Segments== 

===Mean Tweets===
In March 2012, in honor of Twitter&#x27;s sixth anniversary, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; featured a segment called &quot;Mean Tweets&quot; with celebrities—including Will Ferrell, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Roseanne Barr, Anna Faris, and Kathy Griffin—reading aloud actual tweets directed toward them by Twitter users while the song &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; by R.E.M. plays in the background. The segment was extremely popular, with more than 38 million views on YouTube by April 2015.

Additional &quot;Mean Tweets&quot; editions have aired, featuring celebrities including Robert De Niro, Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler, Britney Spears, Sofía Vergara, Jon Hamm, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Aaron Paul, Benedict Cumberbatch, Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, Vanessa Hudgens, Tim Robbins, Hugh Grant and Bill Murray. The tweets selected for the segment are invariably abusive, vulgar, or rude, often objecting to the celebrity&#x27;s physical appearance or perceived lack of talent. In many cases, the celebrity is then afforded the opportunity for a brief (albeit scripted) response to the mean tweet. The show has also aired several themed editions of &quot;Mean Tweets,&quot; including special NBA, NFL, college football, and music editions. In March 2015, President Barack Obama, who was a guest star, took part in a &quot;President Obama edition&quot; of &quot;Mean Tweets,&quot; during which he read tweets from people mocking his jeans and blaming him for the high price of beer. The Obama segment attracted more than 10 million views in one day.

On occasion, Kimmel will introduce a surprise celebrity guest for a live on-stage &quot;Mean Tweet&quot;, which was later made into a compilation. Celebrities who appeared on stage include Jeff Bridges, Dwayne Johnson and Halle Berry.

===This Week in Unnecessary Censorship===
A Thursday-night segment, which features clips of innocuous television shows (such as newscasts) deliberately edited (typically with bleeps) to make them appear offensive.

===Jimmy Kimmel YouTube Challenge===
Kimmel will give out a challenge to viewers asking them to videotape themselves pulling a prank on a family member or significant other, and then revealing that &quot;Jimmy Kimmel told me to do it&quot;. The best clips are then aired on the show.

===Lie Witness News===
A correspondent not seen on camera will ask pedestrians on Hollywood Boulevard a fake question related to an actual current news event. Most of the people answering the question will usually play along, giving the impression that they believe that the so-called fake event really happened.

===Jimmy Kimmel Pedestrian Question===
Kimmel will send a &quot;correspondent&quot; not seen on camera to ask a set of random pedestrians a question related to a certain theme. Kimmel will then have the audience guess the answer to the question, then will reveal the answer to the audience.

===Halloween candy YouTube segments===
Starting in 2011, every Halloween, Kimmel asks his viewers to take away their children&#x27;s Halloween candy, videotape their kids&#x27; reactions once they tell their kids that they ate their Halloween candy, and post it on YouTube with the respective hashtag. Once his team has compiled all the YouTube videos, he airs them on his broadcast days later. These segments have attracted criticism for potential promotion of emotional abuse.

===Generation Gap===
This segment, a quiz show between different generations of family members was spun off into its own game show produced by Kimmel and Mark Burnett. Originally ordered in 2019, it premiered on July 7, 2022, and is hosted by Kelly Ripa.

===Other end-of-show segments===
At the end of some shows, there are comedians doing comedy. This is occasionally seen in place of the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live Concert Series&quot; segment. Another end-of-show segment is the rarely seen &quot;Future Talent Showcase.&quot;

<text>The sungrebe (Heliornis fulica) is a small aquatic gruiform found in the tropical and subtropical Americas from northeastern Mexico to central Ecuador and southern Brazil.

It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Heliornis&quot;. The family Heliornithidae, to which it belongs, contains just two other species: the African finfoot, &quot;Podica senegalensis&quot;, found in the Afrotropics from Sub-saharan West Africa and the Congo Basin through the Great Lakes&#x27; western shores to Southeast Africa, and the Asian or masked finfoot &quot;Heliopais personatus&quot;, found from eastern Indomalaya down through Sundaland to the Wallace Line.

These waterfowl have broad lobes on their feet, convergent to that of grebes or coots, that they use to propel themselves in the water. They are reclusive birds, preferring well-covered slow-flowing streams and secluded waterways, sometimes swimming partly submerged, like an anhinga.

Sungrebes are unique among birds in that males have &quot;pouches&quot;, folds of skin under their wings in which they carry their young from hatching until the chicks are able to swim for themselves. This has led to them being called &quot;Marsupial Birds&quot; Certain feathers, with their own musculature, serve as &quot;guard rails&quot; to prevent the baby from falling out. All of these facts are attested by many witnesses.

==Taxonomy==
The sungrebe was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Colymbus fulica&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The sungrebe is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Heliornis&quot; that was erected by the French naturalist Pierre Bonnaterre in 1791 with the sungrebe as the type species. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek &quot;hēlios&quot; meaning &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;ornis &quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;fulica&quot; is Latin for &quot;coot&quot;. No subspecies are recognised.

There is some debate where the finfoot family, Heliornithidae, fits within Gruiformes. The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based on DNA-DNA Hybridization, suggested that they are sister taxa to limpkins, the Aramidae, and even placed the limpkins within Heliornithidae in 1990. However, more recent genetic analyses suggests that limpkins are sister taxa to cranes, the Gruidae, and that finfeet are instead sister taxa to rails, the Rallidae. Other studies suggest that finfeet and the Afro-Madagascan flufftails, a group originally thought to be nested within rails, form a lineage called Sarothruridae that separated from each other at the end of the Eocene, probably in Africa. Sarothruridae, in turn, is considered a sister clade to Rallidae.

Within Heliornithidae, sungrebes are sister to the Asian finfoot, rather than the geographically closer African finfoot, according to the results of both Mitochondrial and Nuclear DNA sequencing. This adds credence to the idea that finfeet moved from an African origin into Eurasia and then across Beringia and through North America to reach South America, rather than coming across the Atlantic from Africa, or having evolved on Gondwana, separated with the shifting of the continents, and moved north into Laurasia from there. This would also explain the absence of finfeet from Australia, and the success of the Sungrebe at colonizing the continental Neotropics while failing to colonize any major Caribbean islands that do not have glacial land bridges to the mainland.

=== Fossil record ===
The genus &quot;Heliornis&quot; appears to have had a wider distribution in the past; a 14 million year-old fossil humerus attributed to &quot;Heliornis&quot; aff. &quot;fulica&quot; has been described from the Middle Miocene-aged Pungo River Formation of North Carolina, USA. This is the earliest known finfoot fossil, and its discovery raises questions as to whether the thus-far undiscovered South American ancestors of sungrebes moved into North America well before the Great American Interchange, or if they instead came across Beringia and then moved into South America when the Isthmus of Panama formed. The phylogenetic divergence patterns of finfeet, which indicate that the sungrebe is most closely related to the Asian finfoot, support the latter theory.

==Description==
The female is a small, slim bird, averaging about in length. Sungrebes have lobed toes, and the bare skin of their feet and legs are boldly banded in yellow and black. The body plumage is mostly varying shades of reddish brown, while the head and neck are strikingly patterned with a black crown and nape and white stripes along the sides of its neck, as well as a white throat and chin. The long tail (almost a third of the total length) extends well beyond the body in flight, and sits fanned out on or just below the surface of the water while the bird swims. Females have a rufous patch on the side of the face that brightens to a cinnamon-orange color during the breeding season. Also during the breeding season, her eye ring becomes brighter in color and her lower mandible goes from dark red to bright scarlet. Slightly shorter on average than the male, with a slightly shorter wingspan, , but slightly more powerfully-built with a higher average mass, .

The male is similar to the female, but has slightly drabber plumage; in particular the male lacks the bright orange-rufous patch on the cheeks that the female displays, and while his lower mandible turns from pale beige to dark red during the breeding season, it does not get as bright as that of the female. On average he is slightly longer and with a wider wingspan than the female, but more lightly built with a lower average mass (110-140g).
Juveniles have similar plumage to the male, but are slightly smaller, and with a grayer cast to the body feathers and more white on the cheeks and neck.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sungrebes are found in heavily vegetated, mostly freshwater wetland environments, from northeast Mexico south along the Gulf and Caribbean coasts through Panama, where they live throughout the Canal Zone and Darien, and then along the Pacific coast from Panama through central Ecuador. They are also found throughout the Orinoco and Amazon Watershed, the Pantanal, and the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforests. Aside from Trinidad and Tobago, they are not found in most Caribbean nations, and seem to have difficulty dispersing over long distances of saltwater. Though occasionally recorded at higher elevations, the sungrebe is usually associated with lowlands from sea level to around 500 meters. They are residents throughout their range; they do not seem to migrate. Based on the fossil record, sungrebes or a close relative appear to have ranged as far north as the southeastern United States during the Miocene, despite being only restricted to the Neotropics today.

Sungrebes seem to be expanding the northern limit of their range in northeastern Mexico. They were historically found no farther north than central Veracruz, but by the 1940s had established populations throughout Veracruz and into San Luis Potosí. They are now expanding their range further north in Tamaulipas, and an individual was sighted on 13 November 2008 on the Marsh Loop at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, USA, the first historical record of sungrebes in the United States.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The sungrebe has a mating season that begins in the middle of April during the &quot;early wet season&quot;; breeding is correlated with rainfall and corresponding high water levels that flood habitat and bring the sort of low-overhanging vegetation that subgrebes like to build their nest in. The bolder coloration of the females, as well as their greater mass and the males&#x27; role as primary caregiver for the young, suggest that females court the males, although this has not yet been observed. Both the male and female birds take part in the nest building, which typically consists of twigs, reeds, and dried leaves. The nest is a flimsy platform placed about a meter above the water&#x27;s surface.

There are usually two to four eggs in a clutch. They are round in shape with a buffy white to pale cinnamon base color, with irregularly-shaped dark cinnamon, ruddy brown, and pale purple sports scattered uniformly over the surface at variable densities from egg to egg. The eggs hatch after an unusually short incubation period of only 10 to 11 days. Both sexes share responsibility in the incubation of the eggs; the female sits on the nest for most of the daylight hours and throughout the night, while male incubates them during the middle part of the day. Unlike their close relatives, the African and Asian finfoot, whose chicks are said to be precocial, sungrebe chicks are altricial upon hatching, blind and defenseless with only sparse down and poorly matured feet and bill. They are covered with fuzzy down that is countershaded slate-gray with a white belly and throat. The bill is slate-gray with a pale yellow tip.

Males transfer the young to their pouches soon after hatching and keep them there, feeding them and cleaning out their waste, until they are able to swim and feed independently. For some period of time after this, the chicks continue to follow their father and perhaps their mother, often riding on their back. It is unknown how involved mothers are in the care of their young after hatching.

====Pouch====

The pouch of a male sungrebe is a shallow, ovular pocket formed by pleats of well-muscled skin that extend along the side of the chest under the wings, further buffered by a wall of long, curved feathers growing upwards and backwards from the lower part of the side of the chest. These feathers hold chicks in place during movement, even allowing a male to carry them while diving and flying. The bird appears to have some muscular control over the shape of the pleats, and can restrict or enhance fluid flow into the tissue to make them more or less rigid. Each pouch can hold one or two chicks.

It is unknown whether other finfoots share this trait, as it does not persist in prepared skins and would be difficult to spot even in fresh specimens unless one knew to seek it out.

Since no other species of bird have been found that have pouches, it is difficult to say how this evolved; however, in Jacanas, a tropical wading bird found in the same habitat as finfeet in which males also provide most of the parental care, young are frequently sheltered and even carried by tucking them under the wings and holding them against the body. This could have been the ancestral state for Sungrebes, as well.

===Food and feeding===

Sungrebes prefer quiet forest streams and rivers, freshwater ponds, and lakes with thick, overhanging vegetation. Here, they hunt snails and a variety of terrestrial and aquatic arthropods, as well as small fish, frogs and lizards. They will also eat some plant matter, including seeds and fruit. Most hunting and foraging takes place on or just above the surface of the water, although they may make short dives after fish and frogs, or hunt from low perches over the water.

Sungrebes live at variable, but generally low population densities, and are generally solitary or found in pairs. They do not migrate seasonally, except to move out of drying habitats and into flooding ones within their range. It is not known how far juvenile sungrebes disperse after fledging, nor is it known if one sex preferentially disperses. It might be notable, however, that erratic sungrebes found outside of their known range have tended to be females.

There is also no information on life span, age at first breeding, or mortality rates of young.

==Conservation status==
Given that their range is very large and that the species is not directly targeted for human use, BirdLife International (2009) the IUNC evaluates the conservation status of the Sungrebe as of Least Concern. Their northward expansion seems to justify that status. However, very little is known about any population of sungrebe, including the nature of their risk factors and whether the range of the Sungrebe consists of a single large population at low risk or a series of genetically distinct populations at higher risk. Further, tropical wetland areas are attractive targets for agricultural usage and hydroelectric projects. The Sungrebe&#x27;s preference for heavy cover and tendency to avoid the presence of humans may limit its ability to cope with the rapid urbanization of Latin America. Nevertheless, Sungrebes seem to be faring much better than their relatives, who live in much more population-dense, much less well protected or environmentally regulated parts of the world.

<text>The Heliornithidae are a small family of tropical birds with webbed lobes on their feet like those of grebes and coots. The family overall are known as finfoots, although one species is known as a sungrebe. The family is composed of three species in three genera.

==Description==
Finfoots resemble rails; they have long necks, slender bodies, broad tails, and sharp, pointed bills. They have a diverse range of calls, but do not call frequently. Their legs and feet are brightly coloured and, unlike grebes, they are capable of walking well and even moving quickly on land.

==Habitat==
Finfoots are found in numerous habitats in the tropics as long as there is water and cover. It is uncertain why cover is so essential to finfoots, but they are extremely secretive and often overlooked. Their ranges extend from coastal creeks to fast-moving mountain streams, most commonly being found in large slow-moving bodies of water. They also use swamps, reed beds, mangroves, and forest. Finfoots are territorial, probably for much of the year and certainly when breeding. They are not thought to undertake regular migrations, but some birds do regularly disperse and they are quick to colonise new areas of suitable habitat.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===
Finfoots feed on a wide range of foods, insects of various sorts being the most frequently observed component of their diet. Little quantitative information on finfoot diet exists, but they have also been recorded eating molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, frogs, fish and some leaves and seeds. Unlike grebes they do not dive to obtain food, instead picking prey off the water&#x27;s surface or foraging on the shore.

===Breeding===
All three species tend to breed after the wet season, the exact timing of which is dependent on the local climate. The breeding behaviour of the masked finfoot is almost entirely unknown. All three species exhibit some changes in appearance prior to breeding – masked finfoots develop a fleshy knob above the bill, and the plumage of the male African finfoot and female sungrebe also change. There is considerable variation within the finfoots on several aspects of breeding; in the Sungrebe the nest building and incubation duties are shared between the sexes, in the African finfoot the female alone incubates. The nests of all finfoots are untidy bowls of sticks, twigs, and reeds suspended in vegetation above water.

==Species==
There are three species. The African finfoot is found in tropical Africa on streams in woodland. The masked finfoot has a scattered distribution from Eastern India down through southeast Asia to the Wallace Line. The sungrebe is found in tropical Central and South America. Finfoots are highly secretive and many aspects of their biology are unknown to science.

<doc id="217259" wikidata="Q3224719" url="?curid=217259" title="Andy Richter Controls the Universe">
<text>Andy Richter Controls the Universe is an American sitcom created by Victor Fresco that originally aired on Fox from March 19, 2002, to January 12, 2003. The series was Andy Richter&#x27;s first starring role after leaving NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 2000, and centers around Richter&#x27;s eponymous character, a writer living in Chicago who works at a fictional company called Pickering Industries. The show was a joint production of Garfield Grove Productions and 20th Century Fox Television in association with Paramount Television.

Filmed in Los Angeles, California using a single-camera setup, the series was developed after Richter expressed interest in expanding his acting repertoire beyond his previous sidekick role on late-night television. It utilizes a unique narrative style, blending nonlinear storytelling with the unreliable narrator trope. The show features an ensemble cast, including Paget Brewster, Irene Molloy, Jonathan Slavin, and James Patrick Stuart.

&quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; received critical acclaim for its inventive humor and writing, drawing comparisons to other successful Fox comedies such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Despite positive reviews, the series suffered from low ratings, leading to its cancellation after two mid-season runs. The series has since gained a cult following and is regarded as a forerunner to the wave of single-camera comedies that followed, such as &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.

==Production==

===Conception and development===
Andy Richter had departed his long-time role as sidekick on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 2000, after performing in the role since 1993. He expressed a desire to play different roles to the &quot;fat slob roles&quot; he was being offered at the time, and to expand his profile and &quot;see what&#x27;s out there&quot;.

&quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; was the first sitcom that Richter starred in. Some were unsure of Richter&#x27;s acting ability due to his sidekick role on &quot;Late Night&quot;. Richter described an encounter with a Paramount executive after the table read for the series pilot in which the executive exclaimed, &quot;Wow, you can really act!&quot;

Richter met with many creators and writers before deciding to work with Victor Fresco, who already had a deal with Paramount Television. Actress Paget Brewster was already separately familiar with both Richter and Fresco and helped to arrange a meeting between the two. In initial meetings, Fresco and Richter developed the show&#x27;s concept, including the use of narration and the unreliable narrator trope, following which Fresco wrote the show&#x27;s pilot episode. He pitched the show to Fox executives by handing them the first scene to read, and leaving the room as they read it. Executives were enthusiastic, following which he wrote the pilot.

Brewster was cast in the role of Jessica Green after another actress played the part in the original pilot. Fox executives vetoed the original actress as they had previously seen her in pilots that were unsuccessful. Brewster had had a development deal with Fox for two years before the show began. She was required to audition for the show three times against many other actresses.

===Filming===
After Fox picked up the show, a writer&#x27;s room was assembled. Writer Jim Bernstein recalled that Richter himself would sometimes be in the writer&#x27;s room, bucking usual convention, to be supportive and assist. He referred to the writers as &quot;The Nerd Tower&quot;.

The show&#x27;s working title was &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot;, which was vetoed by executives. Fox insisted that the title feature Richter&#x27;s name, which he later said he &quot;wasn&#x27;t entirely comfortable with&quot;. He then pitched the final title, intentionally making it more grandiose for comedic effect. He later called it a &quot;terrible&quot; title, due to viewers&#x27; tendency to forget the entire phrase.

The show was a joint production of Garfield Grove Productions and 20th Century Fox Television in association with Paramount Television.

===Structure===
&quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; was heavily centered around Richter&#x27;s eponymous character, who was also the narrator, continually explaining the plot and his thought processes throughout each episode. The show used nonlinear narrative techniques for comedic effect, for example in the pilot episode, rewinding the scene that had just played out in order to see an alternative version. This technique was tied to the character&#x27;s occupation as a writer, and imaginative personality. The unique format allowed for the creation of unusual gags and sequences.

The series tried out different tones and styles of humor throughout its run. The premiere episode parodied political correctness in workplace hirings, and addressed race relations in a comedic manner. It was noted for its tendency to put a twist on standard sitcom plots and scenarios. One season one episode featured a live kangaroo, which was a &quot;true test of patience&quot; for Richter. The series used music from the 1960s and 1970s.

The outside shots of Andy&#x27;s office are taken from the Duke &amp; Duke building from &quot;Trading Places&quot;.

===Soundtrack===
All music from the show was written by Greg Burns, Jeff Burns, and Brian Kirk. The theme song is sung by Jason Cropper, the original guitarist for Weezer. The song was written for the show, and there is not a full version beyond the short clip in the beginning. However, a slightly longer version of the song is evident on the pilot episode.

===Cancellation===
&quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; was cancelled by Fox in 2003 after two mid-season runs. The series received lukewarm ratings throughout its run. Only 14 of the 19 produced episodes were aired by Fox.

Its changing timeslot was later cited as making the show hard to find for viewers, at a time when scheduling was important for television success, and potentially a reason for the poor ratings. Episodes were only ordered in chunks following the pilot. Richter later said he was &quot;deeply, deeply disappointed&quot; about the show&#x27;s end, and said he was &quot;very very proud&quot; of its legacy. He also speculated that the show not being fully owned by Fox contributed to its cancellation, as well as not being centered around family like other Fox shows of the era.

Reruns of all 19 episodes continued to air on HDNet from mid-2003 until 2006. The series was also shown on the Paramount Comedy Channel, the Irish network TV3, and on the Polish edition of Comedy Central.

==Characters==

The surnames of the characters are very rarely mentioned – with the exception of Andy, most are only mentioned once in the entire series.

===Main===

* Andy Richter: The character, sharing his name with the actor, is an aspiring writer living in Chicago who wants to write short stories. However, he is forced to work as a technical manual writer for Pickering Industries, the fifth largest company in America, to pay the bills. Andy is shy and not good with women. He does not really want to be working at the company, though he is very good at his job.
* Jessica Green (played by Paget Brewster): Jessica worked with Andy for years before she became the head of Andy&#x27;s department, and thus, his boss. They tried dating once, but it did not work out. She often has to act as an intermediary between her superiors and Andy and his co-workers, forcing her to take sides. She is fairly superficial when it comes to men.
* Wendy McKay (played by Irene Molloy): Wendy is the receptionist at Andy&#x27;s office, who Andy is attracted to. However, he finds out that since he has not made a move in a month, Keith has started to date her.
* Byron Togler (played by Jonathan Slavin): Byron is a new illustrator who moves into Andy&#x27;s office, which causes Andy annoyance in the pilot episode. Byron is fairly insecure and shy.
* Keith (played by James Patrick Stuart): Keith is Andy&#x27;s best friend and co-worker and one usually sticks up for the other. He is the handsome guy in the office who has things handed to him because he&#x27;s good-looking.

===Others===
Pickering Industries was founded by Mr. Pickering (John Bliss). Despite being long-dead, he appears in several episodes and has discussions with Andy within the latter&#x27;s imagination. His viewpoints are typically antiquated and contrary to political correctness to an extreme degree. His comments often seem to represent a negative aspect of Andy&#x27;s mind, such as guilt, or self-doubt.

Teak (Charlie Finn) and Phil (Sean Gunn) live in the same building as Andy. They had been members of the same fraternity as Andy, ten years after Andy was a member. As such, they look up to him. It is hinted that Phil might be gay.

===Guest appearances===
Conan O&#x27;Brien appears as Pickering&#x27;s new CEO in the episode &quot;Crazy in Rio&quot;. Other stars to have guest roles include Cedric Yarbrough, Jon Cryer, Molly Sims, Beth Littleford, Rick Peters, Bree Turner, Jarrad Paul, Rex Lee, Lola Glaudini, Patricia Belcher and June Lockhart, who plays Andy&#x27;s grandmother.

==Episodes==

===Broadcast history===
===Season 1 (2002)===
===Season 2 (2002–03)===
==Reception==
&quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Tim Goodman of &quot;SFGATE&quot; praised the series, particularly the writing, saying that it had &quot;smart wit&quot; and favorably comparing it to fellow Fox sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said in a review of the second season that the series had become its own &quot;perfectly realized comic universe&quot;, praising its improvement over the first season, which was &quot;funny but hit-or-miss&quot;. He further praised the cast performances, particularly Brewster&#x27;s. Tucker criticised some jokes in an earlier review that he regarded to be in poor taste.

&quot;Salon.com&quot; praised the series as &quot;absurdly hilarious&quot; and lauded its take on office humor. &quot;Variety&quot; said the series &quot;has the feel of a singular vision — there isn’t a single line in any of the three episodes that felt like it was written by a committee&quot; and said it had the potential to be the most-talked-about comedy from the 2001–02 television season, calling it &quot;a true water-cooler conversation generator&quot;.

&quot;TIME&quot; praised the DVD release, saying the show was &quot;what the DVD format was created for&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;TV Guide&quot; included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;. &quot;ScreenRant&quot; said in 2020 that it had become &quot;something of a cult sitcom&quot;, even going back to the airing of its second season. Tara Ariano of &quot;Cracked&quot; called it an &quot;extremely underrated surrealist sitcom&quot;, and lamented its lack of inclusion on modern streaming services. &quot;Vulture&quot; said it was the &quot;most inventive and funny&quot; of Richter&#x27;s sitcoms.

The series has continued to be positively compared to similar shows such as &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, also on Fox. Frequent series director Andy Ackerman speculated in a retrospective interview that the show was &quot;a year too soon&quot;, before the rise of single-camera television, and praised the show, calling it one of his favorite working experiences. Brewster later said that the cast and crew &quot;definitely got the impression that we weren&#x27;t welcome on the network at the time&quot;. &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; was later noted as being part of a wave of similar single-camera comedies that experimented with the traditional sitcom format, such as &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

===Accolades===
Creator and writer Victor Fresco was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 2002 for his work on the show.

==Home release==
On March 24, 2009, CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released all 19 episodes of &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Some music cues were replaced for the home media release due to licensing issues.

<text>Bey, also spelled as Baig, Bayg, Beigh, Beig, Bek, Baeg, Begh, or Beg, is a Turkic title for a chieftain, and a royal, aristocratic title traditionally applied to people with special lineages to the leaders or rulers of variously sized areas in the numerous Turkic kingdoms, emirates, sultanates and empires in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Europe, and the Middle East, such as the Ottomans, Timurids or the various khanates and emirates in Central Asia and the Eurasian Steppe. The feminine equivalent title was begum. The regions or provinces where &quot;beys&quot; ruled or which they administered were called &quot;beylik&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;governorate&quot; or &quot;region&quot; (the equivalent of a county, duchy, grand duchy or principality in Europe, depending on the size and importance of the beylik). However the exact scope of power handed to the beks (alternative spelling to beys) varied with each country, thus there was no clear-cut system, rigidly applied to all countries defining all the possible power and prestige that came along with the title.

Today, the word is still used formally as a social title for men, similar to the way the titles &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;mister&quot; are used in the English language. Additionally, it is widely used in the naming customs of Central Asia, namely in countries such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Notably, the ethnic designation of Uzbeks comes from the name of Öz Beg Khan of the Golden Horde, being an example of the usage of this word in personal names and even names of whole ethnic groups. The general rule is that the honorific is used with first names and not with surnames or last names.

==Etymology==
The word entered English from Turkish , itself derived from Old Turkic &quot;beg&quot;, which – in the form &quot;bäg&quot; – has been mentioned as early as in the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century AD) and is usually translated as &quot;tribal leader&quot;. The actual origin of the word is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it was a loan-word, in Old Turkic. This Turkic word is usually considered a borrowing from an Iranian language. However, German Turkologist Gerhard Doerfer assessed the derivation from Iranian as superficially attractive but quite uncertain, and pointed out the possibility that the word may be genuinely Turkic. Two principal etymologies have been proposed by scholars:

# the Middle Persian title &quot;bag&quot; (also &quot;baγ&quot; or &quot;βaγ&quot;, Old Iranian &quot;baga&quot;; cf. Sanskrit भग / &quot;bhaga&quot;) meaning &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;master&quot;. Peter Golden derives the word via Sogdian &quot;bġy&quot; from the same Iranian root. All Middle Iranian languages retain forms derived from &quot;baga-&quot; in the sense &quot;god&quot;: Middle Persian &quot;bay&quot; (plur. &quot;bayān&quot;, &quot;baʾān&quot;), Parthian &quot;baγ&quot;, Bactrian &quot;bago&quot;, Sogdian &quot;βγ-&quot;, and were used as honorific titles of kings and other men of high rank in the meaning of &quot;lord&quot;. The Iranian &quot;bāy&quot; (through connection with Old Indian noun &quot;bhāgá&quot; &quot;possessions, lot&quot;) gave Turkish word &quot;bai&quot; (rich), whence Mongol name &quot;Bayan&quot; (rich).
# the Chinese title &quot;pö&quot; (伯 Mandarin &quot;bó&quot;; its historical pronunciation being &quot;pök&quot; or &quot;pak&quot; or &quot;perjk&quot;, as reconstructed Edwin Pulleyblank), meaning &quot;older brother&quot; and &quot;feudal lord&quot;.

It was also used by the Uyghurs. It permitted the Turkic Begs in the Altishahr region to maintain their previous status, and they administered the area for the Qing as officials. High-ranking Begs were allowed to call themselves Begs.

==Turkish beys==
Lucy Mary Jane Garnett wrote in the 1904 work &quot;Turkish Life in Town and Country&quot; that &quot;distinguished persons and their sons&quot; as well as &quot;high government officials&quot; could become &quot;bey&quot;, which was one of two &quot;merely conventional designations as indefinite as our &#x27;Esquire&#x27; has come to be [in the United Kingdom]&quot;.

The Republican Turkish authorities abolished the title circa the 1930s.

However, it is important to note that the title Bey, Baig or Begum, Begzada and Uç Bey are regarded as comparable to the European nobility with the title of Viscount, while Sancak-beys and Atabegs are considered to be of an equivalent rank to earls or counts in the context of European nobility.

==Beys elsewhere==
The title &quot;bey&quot; ( ) was also called or &quot;bek&quot; () – from Turkish () – in North Africa, including Egypt.
A bey could maintain a similar office within Arab states that broke away from the High Porte, such as Egypt and Sudan under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, where it was a rank below pasha (maintained in two rank classes after 1922), and a title of courtesy for a pasha&#x27;s son.

Even much earlier, the virtual sovereign&#x27;s title in Barbaresque North African &#x27;regency&#x27; states was &quot;Bey&quot; (compare Dey). Notably in Tunis, the Husainid Dynasty used a whole series of title and styles including Bey:

* Just Bey itself was part of the territorial title of the ruler, and also as a title used by all male members of the family (rather like Sultan in the Ottoman dynasty).
* Bey al-Kursi &quot;Bey of the Throne&quot;, a term equivalent to reigning prince.
* Bey al-Mahalla &quot;Bey of the Camp&quot;, title used for the next most senior member of the Beylical family after the reigning Bey, the Heir Apparent to the throne.
* Bey al-Taula &quot;Bey of the Table&quot;, the title of the Heir Presumptive, the eldest prince of the Beylical family, who enjoyed precedence immediately after the Bey al-Mahalla.
* Beylerbeyi (or Beglerbegi) &quot;Lord of Lords&quot;, was the administrative rank formally enjoyed by the ruler of Algiers and by rulers of parts of the Balkans in their official capacity of Ottoman Governor-General within the Turkish empire.This title was also used in Safavid empire.

Bey was also the title that was awarded by the Sultan of Turkey in the twilight of the Ottoman Empire to Oloye Mohammed Shitta, an African merchant prince of the Yoruba people who served as a senior leader of the Muslim community in the kingdom of Lagos. Subsequently, he and his children became known in Nigeria by the double-barrelled surname Shitta-Bey, a tradition which has survived to the present day through their lineal descendants.

In the Ottoman period, the lords of the semi-autonomous Mani Peninsula used the title of &quot;beis&quot; (μπέης); for example, Petros Mavromichalis was known as &quot;Petrobey&quot;.

Other Beys saw their own &quot;Beylik&quot; promoted to statehood, e.g.:

* in Qusantina (Constantine in French), an Ottoman district subject to the Algiers regency since 1525 (had its own Beys since 1567), the last incumbent, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif (b. , in office 1826–1848, d. 1850), was maintained when in 1826 the local Kabyle population declared independence, and when it was on 13 October 1837 conquered by France, until it was incorporated into Algeria in 1848.

Bey or a variation has also been used as an aristocratic title in various Turkic states, such as &quot;Bäk&quot; in the Tatar Khanate of Kazan, in charge of a Beylik called &quot;Bäklek&quot;. The Uzbek Khanate of Khiva, Emirate of Bukhara and The Khanate of Kokand used the &quot;beks&quot; as local administrations of &quot;bekliks&quot; or provinces. The Balkar princes in the North Caucasus highlands were known as &quot;taubiy&quot; (taubey), meaning the &quot;mountainous chief&quot;.

Sometimes a Bey was a territorial vassal within a khanate, as in each of the three &quot;zuzes&quot; under the Khan of the Kazakhs.

The variation &quot;Beg&quot;, &quot;Baig&quot; or &quot;Bai&quot;, is still used as a family name or a part of a name in South and Central Asia as well as the Balkans. In Slavic-influenced names, it can be seen in conjunction with the Slavic &quot;-ov/-ović/ev&quot; suffixes meaning &quot;son of&quot;, such as in Bakir and Alija Izetbegović, and Abai Kunanbaev.

The title is also used as an honorific by members of the Moorish Science Temple of America and the Moorish Orthodox Church.

&#x27;Bey&#x27; is also used colloquially in Urdu-speaking parts of India, and its usage is similar to &quot;chap&quot; or &quot;man&quot;. When used aggressively, it is an offensive term.

The Hungarian word &#x27;bő&#x27; originates from an Old Turkic loanword, cognate with Ottoman &#x27;bey&#x27;, that used to mean &#x27;clan leader&#x27; in Old Hungarian. Later, as an adjective, it acquired the meaning of &quot;rich&quot;. Its contemporary meaning is &quot;ample&quot; or &quot;baggy&quot; (when referring to clothing).

<text>Kindergarten is a preschool educational approach based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Such institutions were originally made in the late 18th century in Germany, Bavaria and Alsace to serve children whose parents both worked outside home. The term was coined by German pedagogue Friedrich Fröbel, whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of educational institutions and learning spaces for children ranging from two to six years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods.

==History==

===Early years and development===
In 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strasbourg an early establishment for caring for and educating preschool children whose parents were absent during the day. At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were created in Bavaria. In 1802, Princess Pauline zur Lippe established a preschool center in Detmold, the capital of the then principality of Lippe, Germany (now in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia).

In 1816, Robert Owen, a philosopher and pedagogue, opened the first British and probably globally the first infants school in New Lanark, Scotland. In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills, Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.

Samuel Wilderspin opened his first infant school in London in 1819, and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin&#x27;s system of education. He is credited with inventing the playground. In 1823, Wilderspin published &quot;On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor&quot;, based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote &quot;The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age&quot;.

Countess Theresa Brunszvik (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, was influenced by this example to open an (&#x27;angel garden&#x27; in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828, in her residence in Buda, the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children. In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the Kingdom of Hungary.

===Creation of the kindergarten===

Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852) opened a &quot;play and activity&quot; institute in 1837, in Bad Blankenburg, in the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;garden of children&quot;) on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished &quot;like plants in a garden&quot;. Fröbel introduced a pedagogical environment where children could develop through their own self-expression and self-directed learning, facilitated by play, songs, stories, and various other activities; this was in contrast to earlier infant establishments, and Fröbel is therefore credited with the creation of the kindergarten. Around 1873, Caroline Wiseneder&#x27;s method for teaching instrumental music to young children was adopted by the national kindergarten movement in Germany.

In 1840, the well-connected educator Emily Ronalds was the first British person to study Fröbel&#x27;s approach and he urged her to transplant his kindergarten concepts in England. Later, women trained by Fröbel opened kindergartens throughout Europe and around the world. The first kindergarten in the US was founded in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1856, and was conducted in German by Margaretha Meyer-Schurz.

Elizabeth Peabody founded the first English-language kindergarten in the US in 1860. The first free kindergarten in the US was founded in 1870 by Conrad Poppenhusen, a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the Poppenhusen Institute. The first publicly financed kindergarten in the US was established in St. Louis in 1873 by Susan Blow.

Canada&#x27;s first private kindergarten was opened by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 1870. By the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities. In 1882, The country&#x27;s first public-school kindergartens were established in Berlin, Ontario (modern Kitchener) at the Central School. In 1885, the Toronto Normal School (teacher training) opened a department for kindergarten teaching.

The Australian kindergarten movement emerged in the last decade of the nineteenth century as both a philanthropic and educational endeavour. The first free kindergarten in Australia was established in 1896 in Sydney, New South Wales, by the Kindergarten Union of NSW (now KU Children&#x27;s Services) led by reformer Maybanke Anderson.

American educator Elizabeth Harrison wrote extensively on the theory of early childhood education and worked to enhance educational standards for kindergarten teachers by establishing what became the National College of Education in 1886.

==By country==

===Afghanistan===

In Afghanistan, children between the ages of three and six attend kindergartens (; ). Although kindergartens in Afghanistan are not part of the school system, they are often run by the government.

Early childhood development programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, peaking in 1990 with more than 270 in Afghanistan. At its peak, there were 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children in the country. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, these early childhood development programs provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from three months to six years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.

The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/preschool centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center, at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.

===Australia===

In each state of Australia, &quot;kindergarten&quot; (frequently referred to as &quot;kinder&quot; or &quot;kindy&quot;) means something slightly different. In Tasmania, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it is the first year of primary school. In Victoria, kindergarten is a form of preschool and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania, the term for the first year of primary school is &quot;prep&quot; (short for &quot;preparatory&quot;), which is followed by year 1.

In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of four and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. As with Victoria and Tasmania, the first year of primary school is also called &quot;prep&quot;, which is then followed by year 1.

The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the Northern Territory is referred to respectively as &quot;pre-primary&quot;, &quot;reception&quot; or &quot;transition&quot;. In Western Australia, the year preceding pre-primary is called kindergarten.

===Bangladesh===

In Bangladesh, the term kindergarten, or &quot;KG school&quot; (kindergarten school), is used to refer to the schooling children attend from three to six years of age. The names of the levels are &quot;nursery&quot;, (&#x27;children&#x27;), etc. The view of kindergarten education has changed significantly over time. Almost every rural area now has at least one kindergarten school, with most being run in the Bengali language. They also follow the textbooks published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with slight modification, adding some extra books to the syllabus. The grades generally start from nursery (sometimes &quot;play group&quot;), &quot;KG&quot; afterwards, and end with the 5th grade. Separate from the National Education System, kindergarten contributes greatly toward achieving the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education in Bangladesh.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, kindergarten () is the only non-compulsory education modality, for children up to four years old completed after March 31 for the vast majority of states. From the age of four completed until March 31, the child is eligible for preschool (), which is mandatory and precedes the 1st grade. When a child turns six years old between April 1 and December 31, he/she must be in kindergarten (last grade of preschool nursery school), also known as kindergarten III, also known as .

===Bulgaria===

In Bulgaria, the term () refers to the caring and schooling children attend from ages three to seven (in some cases six). Usually the children attend the from morning until late afternoon when their parents return from work. Most Bulgarian kindergartens are public. Since 2012, two years of preschool education are compulsory. These two years of mandatory preschool education may be attended either in kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools.

===Canada===

Schools outside of Ontario and the Northwest Territories generally provide one year of kindergarten, except some private schools which offer junior kindergarten (JK) for four-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as preschool). Kindergarten is mandatory in British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and is optional elsewhere. The province of Nova Scotia refers to kindergarten as grade primary. After kindergarten, the child begins grade one.

The province of Ontario and the Northwest Territories provide two years of kindergarten, usually part of an elementary school. Within the French school system in Ontario, junior kindergarten is called and senior kindergarten is called , which is a calque of the German word .

Within the province of Quebec, junior kindergarten is called (which is not mandatory), is attended by four-year-olds, and senior kindergarten (SK) is called , which is also not mandatory by the age of five; this class is integrated into primary schools.

===Chile===

In Chile, the term equivalent to kindergarten is , sometimes also called . It is the first level of the Chilean educational system. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from birth until their entry to the (primary education), without being considered compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or subcategories of levels:
* Low nursery: Babies from eighty-five days to one year old.
* High nursery: Children from one to two years old.
* Low Middle Level: Children from two to three years old.
* High Middle Level: Children from three to four years old.
* First level of transition: Often called &quot;pre-kinder&quot;, for children from four to five years old.
* Second level of transition: Usually called &quot;kinder&quot;, for children from five to six years old. It is the last phase of this type of education; upon completion, children go to (first grade of primary education).

===China===
In China, preschool education, before the child enters formal schooling at 6 years of age, is generally divided into a &quot;nursery&quot; or &quot;preschool&quot; stage and a &quot;kindergarten&quot; () stage. These can be two separate institutions, or a single combined one in different areas. Where there are two separate institutions, it is common for the kindergarten to consist of the two upper years, and the preschool to consist of one lower year. Common names for these three years are:
# Nursery (or preschool or playgroup) (): three- to four-year-old children
# Lower kindergarten (): four- to five-year-old children
# Upper kindergarten (): five- to six-year-old children.

In some places, children at five to six years may in addition or instead attend reception or preparatory classes () focusing on preparing children for formal schooling.

State (public) kindergartens only accept children older than three years, while private ones do not have such limitations.

===Denmark===
Kindergarten () is a day care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) were made mandatory in 2009 and are offered by primary schools before a child enters first grade.

Two-thirds of established day care institutions in Denmark are municipal day care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.

Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) forest kindergartens, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.

===Egypt===
In Egypt, children may go to kindergarten for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===Finland===

At the end of the 1850s, Uno Cygnaeus, known as the &quot;father of the Finnish primary school&quot;, presented the idea of bringing kindergartens to Finland after attending a kindergarten in Hamburg and a seminar training kindergarten teachers during his study trip to Central Europe. As early as 1920, there were about 80 kindergartens in operation across Finland, with a total of about 6,000 children.

Kindergarten activity emphasis and background communities vary. In Finland, most kindergartens are society&#x27;s service to families while some are private. The underlying philosophy may be Montessori or Waldorf education. Preschools often also operate in connection with Finnish kindergartens. Kindergartens can also arrange language immersion programs in different languages. Finnish kindergartens now have an early childhood education plan, and parenting discussions are held with the parents of each child every year. Among OECD countries, Finland has higher-than-average public funding for early childhood education and the highest number of staff for children under the age of three: only four children per adult.

===France===

In France, preschool is known as &#x27; (French for &quot;nursery school&quot;, literally &quot;maternal school&quot;). Free &#x27; schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from three to five (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into &#x27; (GS: five-year-olds), &#x27; (MS: four-year-olds), &#x27; (PS: three-year-olds) and &#x27; (TPS: two-year-olds). It became compulsory in 2018 for all children aged three. Even before the 2018 law, almost all children aged three to five attended . It is regulated by the Ministry of National Education.

===Germany===


In Germany, a &#x27; (masculine: , plural &#x27;) is a facility for the care of preschool children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, &#x27; or &#x27; refers to a crèche for the care of children before they enter &#x27; (nine weeks to about three years), while &#x27;—literally &#x27;children&#x27;s day site&#x27;, usually shortened to &quot;&quot;—is an umbrella term for any day care facility for preschoolers.

Attendance is voluntary, and usually not free of charge. Preschool children over the age of one are entitled to receive local and affordable day care. Within the federal system, fall under the responsibility of the states, which usually delegate a large share of the responsibility to the municipalities. Due to the subsidiarity principle stipulated by §4 , there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents&#x27; initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many follow a certain educational approach, such as Montessori, Reggio Emilia, &quot; or Waldorf; forest kindergartens are well established. Most &quot; are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.

Even in smaller townships, there are often both Roman Catholic and Lutheran kindergartens available. Places in crèches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure and must be reserved in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013. The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin or Hamburg, and poorest in parts of Southern Germany.

All caretakers in &#x27; or &#x27; must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.

&#x27; can be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. or longer and may also house a crèche (&#x27;) for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon &#x27; (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged six to ten who spend time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day care nurses (&#x27; or &quot;) working independently of any preschool institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children, typically up to the age of three. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.

The term &#x27; (&#x27;preschool&#x27;) is used both for educational efforts in &#x27; and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each German state. The &#x27; is a type of &#x27;.

===Greece===

In Greece, kindergarten is called (). Kindergarten is a form of preschool and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool.

===Hong Kong===
Pre-primary Services in Hong Kong refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.

At present, most of the kindergartens operate on a half-day basis offering upper and lower kindergarten and nursery classes. Some kindergartens also operate full-day kindergarten classes. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.

The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child&#x27;s development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.

To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed performance indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000–2001 school year, quality assurance inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality early childhood education.

===Hungary===
In Hungary a kindergarten is called an &quot; (&quot;protectory&quot;). Children attend kindergarten between ages three and six or seven (they go to school in the year in which they have their seventh birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of three years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons. Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign language and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year, children begin preparation for elementary school.

Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.

===India===
In India, there are only informal directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation. Directives state that children who are three years old on 30 September in the given academic year are eligible to attend nursery and kindergarten classes. Typically, children spend three to four years of their time in pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st standard in primary school which falls under HRD ministry norms. Pre-primary is not mandatory; however, it is preferred. All government schools and affiliated private schools allow children who are five years of age to enroll in standard 1 of a primary school. Mid-day meals are provided in most parts of the country and institutes run by the government.

===Italy===

In Italy, preschool education refers to two different grades:
* Nursery schools, called &quot; for children between three and thirty-six months;
* formerly &#x27; and now &#x27;, for children three to five years old.

Italian &quot; were officially instituted in a 1971 state law (L. 1044/1971), and may be run by either private or public institutions. They were originally established to allow mothers a chance to work outside of the home, and were therefore seen as a social service. Today, they mostly serve the purpose of general education and social interaction. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children&#x27;s care: well known is the so-called Reggio Emilia approach, named after the city of Reggio Emilia, in Emilia-Romagna.

&#x27; normally occupy small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; usually suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the &#x27; are the classrooms, split into playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.

Maternal schools (&#x27;) were established in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of the official Italian education system, though attendance is not compulsory. Like &#x27; (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.

===Japan===

Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers and fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, social skills, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools. Kindergartens (), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education but are not part of the official education system. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised nursery schools (), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, nursery schools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll 86% at age three and 99% at age five prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education&#x27;s 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.

===North Korea===

North Korean children attend kindergarten from four to six. Kindergartens have two sections; low class ( ) and high class ( ). High class is compulsory.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, children normally attend kindergarten ( ) between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean ages are calculated differently from Western ages: one is considered one year old from birth. Additionally, one&#x27;s age increases by one year on January 1 regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called five-, six- and seven-year-olds). The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis.

Korean kindergartens are National and public(free education and excellent facilities) or private schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens(academy) to give them a head start in English. Such specialized kindergartens(academy) can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost Korean parents send their children to kindergarten.

Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean private kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child&#x27;s knowledge or skills.

Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, private kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of homework. Very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, taekwondo, ballet, soccer or mathematics.

===Kuwait===

In Kuwait, Kuwaiti children may go to free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and five.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, kindergarten is called (literally &#x27;playschool&#x27;, plural ). It is a public education facility which is attended by children between the age of four (or five) and six, when they advance to (elementary school).

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, kindergarten is known as &quot;&quot;. Most kindergartens are available to children of ages five and six (and some are available to children as young as four). For children up to the age of three (or four), there are preschool playgroups. There are no fixed rules for when a child needs to go to a kindergarten, but the majority do at five years of age. The child will usually attend kindergarten for two years, before proceeding to primary school at age seven.

===Mexico===

In Mexico, kindergarten is called , with the last year sometimes referred to as ( is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means &#x27;prior to elementary school&#x27;). The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor Rosaura Zapata, who received the country&#x27;s highest honor for her contribution. It consists of three years of preschool education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional and may be offered in either private schools or public schools.

At private schools, usually consist of three grades, and a fourth may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called ; it comes prior to the other three years and is not obligatory. While the first grade is a playgroup, the other two are classroom education.

In 2002, the Congress of the Union approved the &quot;Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling&quot;, which made preschool education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.

===Mongolia===

In Mongolia, kindergarten is known as or . As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergartens registered in the country. From those 152 kindergartens, 142 are state-owned. Children begin kindergarten at the age of two and finish it by five. The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called , which accepts children between zero and two years of age.

===Morocco===

In Morocco, preschool is known as , , or . State-run, free schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged two to five (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged three to five attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan Department of Education.

===Nepal===

In Nepal, kindergartens are run as private institutions, with their lessons conducted in English. The kindergarten education in Nepal is most similar to that of Hong Kong and India. Children start attending kindergarten from the age of two until they are at least five years old.

The kindergartens in Nepal have the following grades:
# Nursery/playgroup: two- to three-year-olds
# Lower kindergarten: three- to four-year-olds
# Upper kindergarten: four- to five-year-olds

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, the equivalent term to kindergarten was &#x27;. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term &#x27; was also common, after Friedrich Fröbel. However, this term gradually faded in use as the verb &#x27; gained a slightly derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged four to six years), after which children (aged six to twelve years) attended primary school (). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called &#x27; &#x27;primary education&#x27;. For children under four, the country offers private, subsidized day care (&quot;&quot;), which is non-compulsory but nevertheless very popular.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, kindergarten, commonly known as kindy, serves as preparation for primary education. Kindergartens in the country cater to children between two and five years old, offering various session options such as morning, afternoon, and full-day programs. The availability of these sessions depends on the capabilities of the specific center and the child&#x27;s age. Typically, a full day at a kindergarten in New Zealand runs from 8:45 am to 3 pm.

===North Macedonia===

The Macedonian equivalent of kindergarten is (), sometimes called () when the children are younger than four. is not part of the state&#x27;s mandatory education because the educational process in the country begins at the age of five or six, i.e. first grade.

===Norway===

In Norway, &#x27;children&#x27;s garden&#x27; is the term equivalent to kindergarten, used for children in the ages between ten months and six years. The first were founded in Norway in the late 19th century. Although they have existed for 120 years, they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, at minimum the manager, should be educated as &#x27;kindergarten teacher&#x27;, previously known as &#x27;preschool teachers&#x27;. Children younger than three are often kept separate from the older children, since the youngest are only expected to play, rest and eat. All the children spend time outdoors every day. Many let the children sleep outdoors too. There is also an institution called &#x27;children&#x27;s park&#x27;, which does not need to have certified staff.

===Peru===

In Peru, the term refers to the schooling children attend from three to six years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of six. In 1902 the teacher Elvira García y García organized the first kindergarten for children two to eight years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread, through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of Fröbel&#x27;s and Montessori&#x27;s methods and parental participation.

===Philippines===
Early childhood education in the Philippines is mandatory, and is classified into:
* Center-based programs, such as the Barangay day care service, public and private preschools, kindergarten or school-based programs, community or church-based early childhood education programs initiated by non-government organizations or people&#x27;s organizations, workplace-related child care and education programs, child-minding centers, health centers and stations; and
* Home-based programs, such as neighborhood-based playgroups, family day care programs, parent education and home visiting programs.

Early childhood education was strengthened through the creation of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980). In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. Education officially started at the elementary level, and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten was optional until June 6, 2011, when Kindergarten became compulsory which served as a requirement for the implementation of the K–12 curriculum and process of phasing out the 1945–2017 K–10 educational system on April 24, 2012, as part of the K–12&#x27;s 9-year implementation process.

===Poland===

In Poland, (literally &#x27;preschool&#x27;), is a preschool educational institution for children aged from three to six, mandatory for children aged six (this class is also commonly referred to as or &#x27;Class 0&#x27;), and optional for those aged seven whose parents submitted an application for the postponement of primary school.

===Romania===
In Romania, &#x27; (literally &#x27;small garden&#x27;) is the favored form of education for preschool children usually aged three to six. The children are divided into three age groups: &#x27;little group&#x27; (&#x27;, age three–four), &#x27;medium group&#x27; (&#x27;, age four–five) and &#x27;big group&#x27; (&#x27;, age five–six). In the last few years private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system. Attending the last year of kindergarten is compulsory since 2020.

The &#x27;preparatory school year&#x27; () is for children aged six–seven, and since it became compulsory in 2012, it usually takes place inside regular school classrooms and is considered &quot;year 0&quot; of elementary education, bridging the gap between kindergarten and years 1–4 of elementary school.

===Russia===

In the Russian Federation, (, literal translation of &#x27;children&#x27;s garden&#x27;) is a preschool educational institution for children, usually three to six years of age.

===Singapore===

Kindergartens in Singapore provide up to three years of preschool for children ages three to six. The three years are commonly called nursery, kindergarten 1 (K1) and kindergarten 2 (K2), respectively.

The Ministry of Education runs several MOE Kindergartens at highly subsidized fees for K1 and K2 students. Many other kindergartens and nurseries are managed by the private entities, including the PAP Community Foundation which has over 370 kindergartens Other kindergartens are run by religious bodies, civic or business groups.

===South Africa===

Kindergartens (commonly known as creche) in South Africa provide preschool programs for children of all ages up to six. The one to three-year program, known as &quot;nursery&quot;, &quot;kindergarten 1&quot; (K1), and &quot;kindergarten 2&quot; (K2), prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.

===Spain===

In Spain, kindergarten is called &#x27; or &#x27; and covers ages three to six, the three courses being called, respectively, P-3, P-4 and P-5. Though non-mandatory, most children in Spain attend these courses.

Before that, children aged zero to three may attend the &#x27; and take courses P-0, P-1 and P-2. In most parts of Spain &#x27; are specialized schools completely separate from regular schools.

===Sudan===

Kindergarten in Sudan is divided into private and public kindergarten. Preschool is compulsory in Sudan. Kindergarten age spans from three–six years. The curriculum covers Arabic, English, religion, mathematics and more.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, kindergarten activities were established in the 19th century, and have been widely expanded since the 1970s. The first Swedish kindergarten teachers were trained by Henriette Schrader-Breymann at the Pestalozzi-Fröbel Haus, which she founded in 1882. Today Kindergarten education is offered through Förskolor.

===Taiwan===

While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in Taiwan, private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. The curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.

There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English-speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an English only environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students&#x27; abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English immersion preschools continues to grow.

===Uganda===

In Uganda, kindergarten is nursery or pre-primary and usually covers ages three to five, the three classes called baby class, middle class and top class, respectively. Pupils graduating from top class then go on to enrol in P1 – the first year of primary school. Though non-mandatory, most children in Uganda today attend these classes. In most parts of Uganda, nursery schools are specialised schools completely separate from regular primary schools.

===Ukraine===

In 2010, a total of 56% of children aged one to six years old had the opportunity to attend preschool education, the Education and Science Ministry of Ukraine reported in August 2010. Many preschools and kindergartens were closed previously in light of economic and demographic considerations.

===United Kingdom===
The term kindergarten is rarely used in the UK to describe modern preschool education or the first years of compulsory primary school education. Preschools are usually known as nursery schools or nursery classes within a primary school (occasionally creches or playgroups), with private nurseries offering childcare for babies and children up to age four, while the first year of schooling is known as Reception in England and Wales, beginning in the school year a child turns 5 (in practice meaning most start school aged 4) and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland (though different terms may be used in the small minority of UK schools which teach primarily through the medium of a language other than English). Nursery forms part of the Foundation Stage of education. In the 1980s, England and Wales officially adopted the Northern Irish system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the local education authority. In England, schooling is not compulsory until a child&#x27;s fifth birthday but in practice most children join school in the Reception year the September before their fifth birthday at the age of 4. In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of four-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were four by the end of the preceding February).

However, the word &quot;kindergarten&quot; is used for more specialist organisations such as forest kindergartens and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents. Historically the word was used during the nineteenth century when activists like Emily Ronalds and later Adelaide Manning were introducing educators to the work of Friedrich Fröbel.

In the UK, parents have the option of nursery for their children at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Some nurseries are attached to state infant or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector. The Scottish government provides funding so that all children from the age of three until they start compulsory school can attend five sessions per week of two and a half hours each, either in state-run or private nurseries. Working parents can also receive from their employers childcare worth £55 per week free of income tax, which is typically enough to pay for one or two days per week.

====England====
Every child in England at the first school term after their third birthday is entitled to 15 hours per week free childcare funding. Pre-schools in England follow the Early Learning Goals, set by the Early Years Foundation Stage, for education produced by the Department for Education, which carries on into their first year of school at the age of four. This year of school is usually called Reception. The Early Learning Goals cover the main areas of education without being subject driven. These areas include:

The three prime areas:

* communication and language
* physical development
* personal, social and emotional development

The four specific areas:

* literacy
* mathematics
* understanding the world
* expressive arts and design

Pupils attend nursery school for four or five terms. It is also common practice for many children to attend nursery much earlier than this. Many nurseries have the facilities to take on babies, using the &#x27;Early Years Foundation Stage&#x27; framework as a guide to give each child the best possible start to becoming a competent learner and skilful communicator. Nurseries and playgroups are inspected and regulated by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors (Office for Standards in Education).

====Scotland====
The Scottish government defines its requirements for nursery schools in the Early Years Framework and the Curriculum for Excellence. Each school interprets these with more or less independence (depending on their management structure) but must satisfy the Care Inspectorate in order to retain their licence to operate. The curriculum aims to develop:
* confident individuals
* effective contributors
* responsible citizens
* successful learners

===United States===
In the United States, kindergarten is usually part of the K–12 educational system, but attendance is not compulsory across the country; each state determines whether or not kindergarten is compulsory. Forty-three of the fifty states (the exceptions being Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania) require school districts to offer a kindergarten year, either for a full-day or a half-day.

In most schools, children begin kindergarten at age five for one year. Students develop skills such as numeracy, literacy, and a greater awareness of the world around them geographically, scientifically, socially, and culturally.

<text>A school of thought, or intellectual tradition, is the perspective of a group of people who share common characteristics of opinion or outlook of a philosophy, discipline, belief, social movement, economics, cultural movement, or art movement.

==History==
The phrase has become a common colloquialism which is used to describe those that think alike or those that focus on a common idea. The term&#x27;s use is common place.

Schools are often characterized by their currency, and thus classified into &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; schools. There is a convention, in political and philosophical fields of thought, to have &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;classical&quot; schools of thought. An example is the modern and classical liberals. This dichotomy is often a component of paradigm shift. However, it is rarely the case that there are only two schools in any given field.

Schools are often named after their founders such as the &quot;Rinzai school&quot; of Zen, named after Linji Yixuan; and the Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy, named after Abu l&#x27;Hasan al-Ashari. They are often also named after their places of origin, such as the Ionian school of philosophy, which originated in Ionia; the Chicago school of architecture, which originated in Chicago, Illinois; the Prague school of linguistics, named after a linguistic circle founded in Prague; and the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School, whose representatives lived in Tartu and Moscow.

An example of a school of thought in Christianity (and Gnosticism) is Neoplatonism, which has massively influenced Christian thought, from Augustinianism to Renaissance/Humanism to the present day.

<text>Paul Douglas Westphal (November 30, 1950 – January 2, 2021) was an American basketball player and coach.

Westphal played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1972 to 1984. Playing the guard position, he won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in 1974. Westphal played in the NBA Finals again in 1976 as a member of the Phoenix Suns. His NBA career also included stints with the Seattle SuperSonics and the New York Knicks. In addition to being a five-time All-Star selection, Westphal earned three All-NBA First Team selections and one Second Team honor.

After his playing career ended, Westphal coached for Southwestern Baptist Bible College (now Arizona Christian University), Grand Canyon University, and Pepperdine University, and served also as head coach of the Phoenix Suns, Seattle SuperSonics, and Sacramento Kings in the NBA. Westphal coached the Suns to the NBA Finals in 1993.

In 2019, Westphal was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Born in Torrance, California, Westphal went to Aviation High School in Redondo Beach from 1966 to 1969. He attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and played college basketball for the Trojans at guard.

USC had a record in 1971, setting a Trojans record for winning percentage. In that era, the Pac-8 Conference sent only one team (champion UCLA) to the 25-team NCAA tournament and none to the 16-team National Invitation Tournament (NIT).

Westphal was an All-American team captain in 1972. Playing for USC from 1970 to 1972, he averaged 16.9 points per game and led the Trojans with 20.3 points per game in 1972.

==Playing career==

=== Boston Celtics (1972–1975) ===
The Boston Celtics selected Westphal tenth overall in the 1972 NBA draft. After three seasons in Boston, including a championship in 1974, the Celtics traded Westphal and two second round draft picks to the Phoenix Suns for Charlie Scott.

=== Phoenix Suns (1975–1980) ===

In his first season with in Phoenix, Westphal helped the Suns reach their first NBA Finals, against the Celtics. In Game 5 of that series, often called &quot;the greatest game ever played&quot; in NBA history, he made several critical plays that pushed the game into triple overtime before Boston prevailed. Notably, Westphal exploited a loophole within NBA rules that effectively allowed the Suns to cede a point to get the ball at half-court with two seconds remaining at the end of the second overtime; the Suns tied the game thanks to the loophole.

Westphal was sixth in the NBA in scoring average for the season at 25.2 points per game, and was also the first NBA All-Star Weekend H-O-R-S-E Competition champion. The following season, he was seventh in scoring average with 24.0 points per game.

=== Seattle Supersonics (1980–1981) ===
After the 1979–80 season in early June, the Suns traded Westphal to the Seattle SuperSonics for Dennis Johnson, He played 36 games in the 1980–81 season, limited by a stress fracture in his right foot. He was a free agent after the season, but Seattle held the right of first refusal. He was unable to come to terms with the Sonics.

=== New York Knicks (1982–1983) ===
After missing most of the 1981–82 season, Westphal signed with the New York Knicks in late February 1982 after Seattle declined to match the offer. He was named the NBA Comeback Player of the Year in 1982–83, when he averaged 10 points and 5.5 assists and helped the Knicks qualify for the playoffs.

=== Return to Phoenix (1983–1984) ===
He signed a two-year contract with Phoenix in September 1983, and the Suns waived him in October 1984.

In his NBA career, Westphal scored a total of 12,809 points for an average of 15.6 points per game, with 3,591 assists for an average of 4.4 assists per game. He also had 1,580 rebounds, for an average of 1.9 per game. Westphal was a five-time All-Star, a three-time All-NBA first team selection, and a one-time second team All-NBA selection. He is Phoenix&#x27;s fifth all-time leading scorer (9,564), averaging 20.6 points in six seasons (1975–80, 1983–84). His No. 44 was retired by the Suns, and he is a member of their Ring of Honor. Westphal was also inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a player on September 6, 2019.

==Coaching career==

Westphal&#x27;s coaching career started in 1985 at Southwestern Baptist Bible College (now Arizona Christian University), located in Phoenix. After compiling a 21–9 record in his lone season there, he moved on to Grand Canyon College, also in Phoenix, and after two seasons led them to the NAIA national title in 1988.

In 1988, after three years in the college ranks, Westphal became an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns under head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, and in 1992, he succeeded Fitzsimmons as head coach of the Suns. With players such as Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, rookie Richard Dumas, Charles Barkley, and Danny Ainge, the Suns made it to the NBA Finals in Westphal&#x27;s first season as a coach, but lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games. While the Suns made the playoffs during each of Westphal&#x27;s seasons as coach, they did not return to the Finals, and Westphal was let go during the 1995–96 season. He served as an assistant coach for a high school team in Arizona for two years before he returned to the NBA as a coach with the SuperSonics for the 1998–99 season. He coached in Seattle until he was fired 15 games into the 2000–01 season.

Westphal returned to the college ranks in April 2001 at Pepperdine University. In his first season, Westphal led the Waves to a 22–9 record and tied the nationally ranked Gonzaga Bulldogs for the WCC title. The team received an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament, but lost 83–74 to Wake Forest in the first round, played at ARCO Arena in Sacramento. This was the only postseason berth during the rest of Westphal&#x27;s five-year tenure and he finished with an overall record of 74–72. After a 7–20 season in 2005–06, Westphal was fired on March 15, 2006.

On June 28, 2007, the Dallas Mavericks announced they had hired Westphal as an assistant coach under head coach Avery Johnson. When Johnson was replaced by Rick Carlisle, Westphal left coaching to become executive vice-president of basketball operations (under Donnie Nelson) for the Mavericks in October 2008. On June 10, 2009, Westphal was named head coach of the Sacramento Kings. Westphal was fired from the Kings on January 5, 2012.

For the 2014–15 season, Westphal was hired by the Brooklyn Nets as an assistant to new head coach Lionel Hollins. Hollins had previously served as Westphal&#x27;s assistant coach in Phoenix. When the Nets fired Hollins in January 2016, Westphal left the team.

== Broadcasting career ==
Westphal also worked as a studio analyst for Fox Sports Net West/Prime Ticket for Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers games, first joining them during the Clippers&#x27; run in the 2006 NBA Playoffs.
