<text>, also known as the Monbusho system (named after the endonym for the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) or MEXT system, is the Cabinet-ordered romanization system for transcribing the Japanese language into the Latin alphabet. Its name is rendered Kunreisiki rômazi in the system itself. It is taught in the Monbushō-approved elementary school curriculum. The ISO has standardized Kunrei-shiki under ISO 3602.

Kunrei-shiki is based on the older Nihon-shiki romanization, which was modified for modern standard Japanese. For example, the word かなづかい, romanized &quot;kanadukai&quot; in Nihon-shiki, is pronounced &quot;kanazukai&quot; in modern standard Japanese and is romanized as such in Kunrei-shiki. The system competes with the older Hepburn romanization system, which was promoted by the SCAP during the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II.

== History ==
In 1930, the Ministry of Education appointed a board of inquiry to determine the proper romanization system of the Japanese language. This resulted in a cabinet order (訓令 &quot;kunrei&quot;) issued on 21 September 1937 that a modified form of the Nihon-shiki system would be officially adopted as Kunrei-shiki. The form at the time differs slightly from the modern form. Originally, the system was called the &quot;Kokutei&quot; (国定, government-authorized) system.

The Japanese government gradually introduced Kunrei-shiki; which appeared in secondary education, on railway station signboards, on nautical charts, and on the 1:1,000,000 scale International Map of the World; as well as literature and educational material for tourists. Nevertheless, unofficial use of Nihon-shiki and Modified Hepburn continued concurrently because of support from individuals.

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Pacific War in 1945, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), issued a directive, dated 3 September 1945, that stated that Modified Hepburn was the method to transcribe Japanese names. Some editorials printed in Japanese newspapers advocated for using only Hepburn. Kunrei-shiki had developed associations with Japanese militarism, and the US occupation was reluctant to promote it. Supporters of Hepburn denounced pro-Kunrei-shiki and pro-Nihon-shiki advocates to the SCAP offices by accusing them of being inactive militarists and of collaborating with militarists. Unger said that the nature of Kunrei-shiki led to &quot;pent-up anger&quot; by Hepburn supporters. During the postwar period, several educators and scholars tried to introduce romanized letters as a teaching device and a possible later replacement for kanji. On 9 December 1954, the Japanese government re-confirmed Kunrei-shiki as its official system but with slight modifications. Eleanor Jorden, an American linguist, made textbooks with a modified version of Kunrei-shiki, which were used in the 1960s in courses given to US diplomats. The use of her books did not change the US government&#x27;s hesitation to use Kunrei-shiki.

As of 1974, according to the Geographical Survey Institute (now the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan), Kunrei-shiki was used for topographical maps, and Modified Hepburn was used for geological maps and aeronautical charts.

As of 1978, the National Diet Library used Kunrei-shiki. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and many other official organizations instead used Hepburn, as did &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, the JTB Corporation, and many other private organisations.

Despite the official status of Kunrei-shiki and its use in Japanese elementary schools, Hepburn romanization remained the primary romanization system used in Japanese government and by other groups in Japan.

== Legal status ==
The system was originally promulgated as Japanese Cabinet Order No. 3 as of 21 September 1937. Since it had been overturned by the SCAP during the occupation of Japan, the Japanese government repealed it and decreed again, as Japanese Cabinet Order No.1 as of 29 December 1954. It mandated the use of Kunrei-shiki in &quot;the written expression of Japanese generally&quot;. Specific alternative spellings could be used in international relations and to follow established precedent. See Permitted Exceptions for details.

Kunrei-shiki has been recognised, along with Nihon-shiki, in &quot;ISO 3602:1989. Documentation—Romanisation of Japanese (kana script)&quot; by the ISO. It was also recommended by the ANSI after it withdrew its own standard, &quot;ANSI Z39.11-1972 American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese (Modified Hepburn)&quot;, in 1994.

In January 2024, the Cultural Affairs Agency proposed revising the 1954 Cabinet Order to make Hepburn the standard romanization system of Japan.

== Usage ==
Despite its official recognition, the Japanese commonly choose between the Nihon-shiki/Kunrei-shiki and Hepburn systems for any given situation. However, the Japanese government generally uses Hepburn, especially for passports, road signage, and train signage. Most Western publications, as well, and all English-language newspapers use some form of Hepburn.

J. Marshall Unger, the author of &quot;Literacy and Script Reform in Occupation Japan: Reading between the Lines&quot;, said that the Hepburn supporters &quot;understandably&quot; believed that the Kunrei-shiki &quot;compromise&quot; was not fair because of the presence of the &quot;un-English-looking spellings&quot; that the Modified Hepburn supporters had opposed. Andrew Horvat, the author of &quot;Japanese Beyond Words: How to Walk and Talk Like a Native Speaker&quot;, argued that &quot;by forcing non-native speakers of Japanese with no intentions of learning the language to abide by a system intended for those who have some command of Japanese, the government gave the impression of intolerant language management that would have dire consequences later on.&quot; Because Kunrei-shiki is based on Japanese phonology rather than the actual phonetic realization, it can cause non-native speakers to pronounce words incorrectly. John Hinds, the author of &quot;Japanese: Descriptive Grammar&quot;, describes that as &quot;a major disadvantage.&quot;

Additional complications appear with newer kana combinations such as ティーム (チーム) &quot;team&quot;. In Hepburn, they would be distinguished as different sounds and represented as &quot;tīmu&quot; and &quot;chīmu&quot; respectively. That gives better indications of the English pronunciations. For some Japanese-speakers, however, the sounds ティ &quot;ti&quot; and チ &quot;chi&quot; are the same phoneme; both are represented in Kunrei-shiki as &quot;tîmu&quot;. Such complications may be confusing to those who do not know Japanese phonology well. Use of an apostrophe (t&#x27;îmu), not unseen in , may be a possible solution.

Today, the main users of Kunrei-shiki are native speakers of Japanese, especially within Japan, and linguists studying Japanese. The main advantage of Kunrei-shiki is that it is better able to illustrate Japanese grammar, as Hepburn gives the impression of certain conjugations being irregular (see table, right). The most serious problem of Hepburn in this context is that it may change the stem of a verb, which is not reflected in the underlying morphology of the language. One notable introductory textbook for English-speakers, Eleanor Jorden&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, uses her JSL romanization, a system strongly influenced by Kunrei-shiki in its adherence to Japanese phonology, but it is adapted to teaching proper pronunciation of Japanese phonemes.

=== Kunrei-shiki spellings of kana ===
===Notes===
* Characters in red are obsolete in modern Japanese.
* When &quot;he&quot; (へ) is used as a particle, it is written as &quot;e&quot;, not &quot;he&quot; (as in Nihon-shiki).
* When &quot;ha&quot; (は) is used as a particle, it is written as &quot;wa&quot;, not &quot;ha&quot;.
* &quot;wo&quot; (を/ヲ) is used only as a particle, written &quot;o&quot;.
* Long vowels are indicated by a circumflex accent: long &quot;o&quot; is written &quot;ô&quot;.
* Vowels that are separated by a morpheme boundary are not considered to be a long vowel. For example, おもう (思う) is written &quot;omou&quot;, not &quot;omô&quot;.
* Syllabic &quot;n&quot; (ん) is written as &quot;n&quot;&#x27; before vowels and &quot;y&quot; but as &quot;n&quot; before consonants and at the end of a word.
* Geminate consonants are always marked by doubling the consonant following the sokuon (っ).
* The first letter in a sentence and all proper nouns are capitalized.
* ISO 3602 has the strict form; see Nihon-shiki.

=== Permitted exceptions ===
The Cabinet Order makes an exception to the above chart:
* In international relations and situations for which prior precedent would make a sudden reform difficult, the spelling given by Chart 2 may also be used:

The exceptional clause is not to be confused with other systems of romanization (such as Hepburn) and does not specifically relax other requirements, such as marking long vowels.

<doc id="225244" wikidata="Q184992" url="?curid=225244" title="Bronisław Malinowski">
<text>Bronisław Kasper Malinowski (; 7 April 1884 – 16 May 1942) was a Polish anthropologist and ethnologist whose writings on ethnography, social theory, and field research have exerted a lasting influence on the discipline of anthropology.

Malinowski was born and raised in what was part of the Austrian partition of Poland, Kraków. He graduated from King John III Sobieski 2nd High School. In the years 1902–1906 he studied at the philosophy department of the Jagiellonian University and received his doctorate there in 1908. In 1910, at the London School of Economics (LSE), he worked on exchange and economics, analysing Aboriginal Australia through ethnographic documents. In 1914, he travelled to Australia. He conducted research in the Trobriand Islands and other regions in New Guinea and Melanesia where he stayed for several years, studying indigenous cultures.

Returning to England after World War I, he published his principal work, &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot; (1922), which established him as one of Europe&#x27;s most important anthropologists. He took posts as a lecturer and later as chair in anthropology at the LSE, attracting large numbers of students and exerting great influence on the development of British social anthropology. Over the years, he guest-lectured at several American universities; when World War II broke out, he remained in the United States, taking an appointment at Yale University. He died in 1942 and was interred in the United States. In 1967 his widow, Valetta Swann, published his personal diary kept during his fieldwork in Melanesia and New Guinea. It has since been a source of controversy, because of its ethnocentric and egocentric nature.

Malinowski&#x27;s ethnography of the Trobriand Islands described the complex institution of the Kula ring and became foundational for subsequent theories of reciprocity and exchange. He was also widely regarded as an eminent fieldworker, and his texts regarding anthropological field methods were foundational to early anthropology, popularizing the concept of participatory observation. His approach to social theory was a form of psychological functionalism that emphasised how social and cultural institutions serve basic human needs—a perspective opposed to A. R. Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s structural functionalism, which emphasised ways in which social institutions function in relation to society as a whole.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Malinowski, a scion of the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), was born on 7 April 1884 in Kraków, in the Austrian Partition of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth – then part of the Austro-Hungarian province known as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. His father, Lucjan Malinowski, was a professor of Slavic philology at Jagiellonian University, and his mother was the daughter of a landowning family. As a child he was frail, often in ill health, but excelled academically. On 30 May 1902 he passed his &quot;matura&quot; examinations (with distinction) at the Jan III Sobieski Secondary School, and later that year began studying at the College of Philosophy of Kraków&#x27;s Jagiellonian University, where he initially focused on mathematics and the physical sciences.

While attending the university he became severely ill (possibly with tuberculosis), and while he recuperated his interest turned more toward the social sciences as he took courses in philosophy and education. In 1908 he received a doctorate in philosophy from Jagiellonian University; his thesis was titled &quot;On the Principle of the Economy of Thought&quot;.

During his student years he became interested in travel abroad, and visited Finland, Italy, the Canary Islands, western Asia, and North Africa; some of those travels were at least partly motivated by health concerns. He also spent three semesters at the University of Leipzig (–1910), where he studied under economist Karl Bücher and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, and examined the works of anthropologist Heinrich Schurtz. After reading James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, he decided to become an anthropologist.

In 1910 he went to England, becoming a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics (LSE), where his mentors included C. G. Seligman and Edvard Westermarck.

===Career===
In 1911 Malinowski published, in Polish, his first academic paper, &quot;Totemizm i egzogamia&quot; (&quot;Totemism and Exogamy&quot;), in &quot;Lud&quot;. The following year he published his first English-language academic paper, and in 1913 his first book, &quot;The Family among the Australian Aborigines&quot;. In the same year he gave his first lectures at LSE, on topics related to psychology of religion and social psychology.

In June 1914 he departed London, travelling to Australia, as the first step in his expedition to Papua (in what would later become Papua New Guinea). The expedition was organised under the aegis of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). Initially Malinowski&#x27;s journey to Australia was supposed to last only about half a year, as he was mainly planning on attending a conference there, and travelled there in the capacity of secretary to Robert Ranulph Marett. Shortly afterward, his situation became complicated due to the outbreak of World War I. Although Polish by ethnicity, he was a subject of Austria-Hungary, which was at war with the United Kingdom. Malinowski, at risk of internment, nonetheless decided not to return to Europe, and after intervention by a number of his colleagues, including Marett as well as Alfred Cort Haddon, the Australian authorities allowed him to stay in the region and even provided him with new funding.

His first field trip, lasting from August 1914 to March 1915, took him to the Toulon Island (Mailu Island) and the Woodlark Island. This field trip was described in his 1915 monograph &quot;The Natives of Mailu&quot;. Subsequently, he conducted research in the Trobriand Islands in the Melanesia region. He organized two larger expeditions during that time; from May 1915 to May 1916, and October 1917 to October 1918, in addition to several shorter excursions. It was during this period that he conducted his fieldwork on the Kula ring (a ceremonial exchange system conducted by the natives he studied) and advanced the practice of participant observation, which remains the hallmark of ethnographic research today. The ethnographic collection of artifacts from his expeditions is mostly held by the British Museum and the Melbourne Museum. During the breaks in between his expeditions he stayed in Melbourne, writing up his research, and publishing new articles, such as &quot;Baloma; the Spirits of the Dead in the Trobriand Islands&quot;. In 1916 he received the title of Doctor of Sciences.

In 1919, he returned to Europe, staying at Tenerife for over a year before coming back to England in 1920 and finally to London in 1921. He resumed teaching at the LSE, accepting a position as a lecturer, declining a job offer from the Polish Jagiellonian University. The following year, his book &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot;, often described as his masterpiece, was published. For the next two decades, he would establish the LSE as Europe&#x27;s main centre of anthropology. In 1924 he was promoted to a reader, and in 1927, a full professor (foundation Professor of Social Anthropology). In 1930 he became a corresponding foreign member of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1933, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1934 he travelled to British East Africa and Southern Africa, carrying out research among several tribes such as the Bemba, Kikuyu, Maragoli, Maasai and the Swazi people. The period 1926-1935 was the most productive time of his career, seeing the publications of many articles and several more books.

Malinowski taught intermittently in the United States, which he first visited in 1926 to study the Hopi. When World War II broke out during one of his American visits, he stayed there. He became an outspoken critic of Nazi Germany, arguing that it posed a threat to civilization, and he repeatedly urged US citizens to abandon their neutrality; his books duly became banned in Germany. In 1941 he carried out field research among the Mexican peasants in Oaxaca. He took up a position at Yale University as a visiting professor, where he remained until his death. In 1942 he co-founded the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America, of which he became its first president.

In addition to his work in academia, he has been described as a &quot;wittily entertaining pundit&quot; who wrote and spoke in media of the day on various issues, such as religion and race relations, nationalism, totalitarianism, and war, as well as birth control and sex education. He was a supporter of the British Social Hygiene Council, Mass-Observation, and the International African Institute.

Malinowski died in New Haven, Connecticut on 16 May 1942, aged 58, of a stroke while preparing to resume his fieldwork in Oaxaca. He was interred at Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.

==Works==
Except for a few works from the early 1910s, all of Malinowski&#x27;s research was published in English. His first book, &quot;The Family among the Australian Aborigines&quot;, published in 1913, was based on materials he collected and wrote in the years 1909–1911. It was well-received not only by contemporary reviewers but also by scholars generations later. In 1963, in his foreword to its new edition, John Arundel Barnes called it an epochal work, and noted how it discredited the previously held theory that Australian Aborigines had no institution of family.

Published in 1922, &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot;, about the society and economy of Trobriand people who live on the small Kiriwana island chain northeast of the island of New Guinea, was widely regarded as a masterpiece and significantly boosted Malinowski&#x27;s reputation in the world of academia. His later books included &quot;Crime and Custom in Savage Society&quot; (1926), &quot;Myth in Primitive Psychology&quot; (1926), &quot;Sex and Repression in Savage Society&quot; (1927), &quot;The Father in Primitive Psychology&quot; (1927), &quot;The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia&quot; (1929), and &quot;Coral Gardens and Their Magic&quot; (1935). The works tackled issues such as reciprocity and quasi-legal sanctions (in &quot;Crime&quot;...), psychoanalysis of ethnographic findings (in &quot;Sex and Repression...)&quot; courtship, sex, marriage, and the family (in &quot;The Sexual Life&quot;...), and perceived connections between agriculture and magic (in &quot;Coral Gardens&quot;...).

His paper &quot;Psycho-Analysis and Anthropology&quot; (1924) is believed to be the first use of the term &quot;nuclear family&quot;. He incorporated the paper into his &quot;Sex and Repression in Savage Society&quot; (1927).

A number of his works were published posthumously or collected in anthologies: &quot;A Scientific Theory of Culture and Others Essays&quot; (1944), &quot;Freedom &amp; Civilization&quot; (1944), &quot;The Dynamics of Culture Change&quot; (1945), &quot;Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays&quot; (1948), &quot;Sex, Culture, and Myth&quot; (1962), the controversial &quot;A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Early Writings of Bronislaw Malinowski&quot; (1993).

Malinowski&#x27;s personal diary, along with several others written in Polish, was discovered in his Yale University office after his death. First published in 1967, covering the period of his fieldwork in 1914–1915 and 1917–1918 in New Guinea and the Trobriand Islands, it set off a storm of controversy and what Michael W. Young called a &quot;moral crisis of the discipline&quot;. Writing in 1987, James Clifford called it &quot;a crucial document for the history of anthropology&quot;.

Many of Malinowski&#x27;s works entered public domain in 2013.

==Ideas and influences==

Already a year after his death Clyde Kluckhohn described his influence in the field as significant if somewhat controversial, noting that to some he &quot;was a major prophet&quot;, and that &quot;no anthropologist has ever had so wide a popular audience&quot;. In 1974 Witold Armon described many of his works as &quot;classics&quot;. Michael W. Young outlined Malinowski&#x27;s major contributions as the comparative study of concepts of kinship, marriage, the family; magic, mythology, and religion. His work impacted numerous fields such as economic anthropology; comparative law, and in pragmatic linguistic theory.

===Ethnography and fieldwork===
Malinowski is considered one of anthropology&#x27;s most skilled ethnographers, especially because of his highly methodical and well-theorised approach to the study of social systems. He is often referred to as the first researcher to bring anthropology &quot;off the verandah&quot; (a phrase that is also the name of a André Singer&#x27;s 1986 documentary about his work), that is, stressing the need for fieldwork enabling the researcher to experience the everyday life of his subjects along with them. Malinowski emphasized the importance of detailed participant observation and argued that anthropologists must have daily contact with their informants if they are to adequately record the &quot;imponderabilia of everyday life&quot; that are so important to understanding a different culture. He stated that the goal of the anthropologist, or ethnographer, is &quot;to grasp the native&#x27;s point of view, his relation to life, to realize &quot;his&quot; vision of &quot;his&quot; world&quot;. Because of the influence of his argument, he is sometimes credited, particularly in the United Kingdom, with having invented the field of ethnography. J. I. (Hans) Bakker says that Malinowski &quot;wrote at least two of the 100 most significant ethnographies of all time&quot;.

Malinowski in his pioneering research set up a tent in the middle of villages he studied, in which he lived for extended periods of time, weeks or months. His argument was shaped by his initial experiences as an anthropologist in the mid-1910s in Australia and Oceania, where during his first field trip he found himself grossly unprepared for it, due to not knowing the language of the people he set to study, nor being able to observe their daily customs sufficiently (during that initial trip, he was lodged with a local missionary and just made daily trips to the village, an endeavor which became increasingly difficult once he lost his translator). His pioneering decision to subsequently immerse himself in the life of the natives represents his solution to this problem, and was the message he addressed to new, young anthropologists, aiming to both improve their experience and allow them to produce better data.

He advocated that stance from his very first publications, which were often harshly critical of those of his elders in the field of anthropology, who did most of their writing based on second-handed accounts. This could be seen in the relation between Frazer - an influential early anthropologist, nonetheless described as the classic armchair scholar - and Malinowski was complex; Frazer was one of Malinowski&#x27;s mentors and supporters, and his work is credited with inspiring young Malinowski to become an anthropologist. At the same time, Malinowski was critical of Frazer from his early days, and it has been suggested that what he learned from Frazer was not &quot;how to be an anthropologist&quot; but &quot;how not to do anthropology&quot;. Ian Jarvie wrote that many of Malinowski&#x27;s writing represented an &quot;attack&quot; on Frazer&#x27;s school of fieldwork, although James A. Boon suggested this conflict has been exaggerated.

His early works also contributed to scientific study of sex, previously restricted due to Euro-American prudery and views on morality. Malinowski&#x27;s interest in the topic has been attributed to his Slavic background having made him less concerned with &quot;Anglo-Saxon puritanism&quot;.

===Functionalism and other theories===
Malinowski has been credited with originating, or being one of the main originators of, the school of social anthropology known as functionalism. It has been suggested that he was here inspired by the views of William James. In contrast to Alfred Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s structural functionalism, Malinowski&#x27;s psychological functionalism held that culture functioned to meet the needs of individuals rather than the needs of society as a whole. He reasoned that when the needs of individuals, who comprise society, are met, then the needs of society are met. Malinowski understood basic needs as arising from the necessities of biology; and culture, as group cooperation – as a way of addressing the basic needs. Thus, biological needs include metabolism, reproduction, bodily comforts, safety, movement, growth, and health; and the corresponding cultural responses are a food supply, kinship, shelter, protection, activities, training, and hygiene.

The development of Malinowski&#x27;s theory of psychological functionalism was intimately tied to his focus on the importance of fieldwork: the anthropologist must, via empirical observation, investigate the functions of the customs observed in the present. To Malinowski, people&#x27;s feelings and motives were crucial to understanding the way their society functioned, which he outlined as follows:

Malinowski, in what is considered an important contribution to cross-cultural psychology, challenged the claim, to universality, of Freud&#x27;s theory of the Oedipus complex. Malinowski initiated a cross-cultural approach in &quot;Sex and Repression in Savage Society&quot; (1927), demonstrating that specific psychological complexes are not universal.

In 1920 he published his first scientific article on the Kula ring. In reference to the Kula ring, he later wrote:


In these two passages, Malinowski anticipated the distinction between description and analysis, and between the views of actors and analysts. This distinction continues to inform anthropological methods and theories. His research on the Trobriand traditional economy, with its particular focus on magic and magicians, has been described as a substantial contribution to economic anthropology.

Overall, Malinowski has been credited with &quot;contesting existing stereotypes&quot;, such as dismissals of &quot;primitive economics&quot;, through his study of the Kula ring, which demonstrated how economics was embedded in culture. He criticized the term &quot;primitive superstition&quot;, demonstrating complex relations among magic, science, and religion. Likewise his study of sexuality undermined simplistic views of &quot;primitive sexuality&quot;.

Malinowski influenced African studies, serving as academic mentor to Jomo Kenyatta, the father and first president of modern Kenya. Malinowski wrote the introduction to &quot;Facing Mount Kenya&quot;, Kenyatta&#x27;s ethnographic study of the Kikuyu. Many of Malinowski&#x27;s students worked in Africa, likely due to his involvement with the International African Institute.

===Teacher===
Malinowski is considered to have raised the next generation of anthropologists, particularly British. Many of his students adopted his functionalist approach. As a teacher, he preferred lectures to discussions; his seminars have been called &quot;electrifying&quot;. He has been praised for his friendly and egalitarian attitude towards women students. Among his students were such future social scientists as Hilda Beemer Kuper, Edith Clarke, Kazimierz Dobrowolski, Raymond Firth, Meyer Fortes, Feliks Gross, Francis L. K. Hsu, Phyllis Kaberry, Jomo Kenyatta, Edmund Leach, Lucy Mair, Z. K. Matthews, Józef Obrębski, Maria Ossowska, Stanisław Ossowski, Ralph Piddington, Hortense Powdermaker, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Margaret Read, Audrey Richards, Isaac Schapera, Andrzej Jan Waligórski, Camilla Wedgwood, Monica Wilson and Fei Xiaotong.

==Legacy==

The Malinowski Memorial Lecture, an annual anthropology lecture series at the LSE, inaugurated in 1959, is named after him. A student-led anthropology magazine at the LSE, &quot;The Argonaut&quot;, took its name from Malinowski&#x27;s &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot;.

The Society for Applied Anthropology established the Bronislaw Malinowski Award in his honor in 1950. The award was awarded only until 1952, then went on hiatus until being re-established in 1973; it has been awarded annually since.

Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz based a character, Duke of Nevermore, from his novel &quot;The 622 Downfalls of Bungo or The Demonic Woman&quot; (written in the 1910s but not published until 1972) on Malinowski.

In 1957 Raymond Firth edited a book dedicated to the life and work of Malinowski, &quot;Man and Culture&quot;. Other works about Malinowski have appeared since, such as Michael W. Young&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2004).

He is portrayed by Tom Courtenay in the &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; TV movie &quot;Treasure of the Peacock&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

The life and work of Malinowski is the subject of a documentary film &quot;Tales From The Jungle: Malinowski&quot; aired by BBC Four channel in 2007.

==Personal life==
In his youth he was a close friend of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, a Polish artist; this friendship had much impact on Malinowski&#x27;s early life. They had a romantic triangle with Zofia Romer &quot;née&quot; Dembowska. Throughout his life he gained the reputation of a philanderer.

His other friends from his student times included Maria Czaplicka, the first female lecturer in anthropology at Oxford University.

In 1919 Malinowski married Elsie Rosaline Masson, an Australian photographer, writer, and traveler (daughter of David Orme Masson), with whom he had three daughters: Józefa (born 1920), Wanda (born 1922), and Helena (born 1925). Elsie died in 1935, and in 1940 Malinowski married the English painter Valetta Swann. Malinowski&#x27;s daughter Helena Malinowska Wayne wrote several articles on her father&#x27;s life and a book about her parents.

While Malinowski was brought up in the Catholic faith, after his mother&#x27;s death he described himself as agnostic.

<doc id="225245" wikidata="Q456180" url="?curid=225245" title="Don Cherry (trumpeter)">
<text>Donald Eugene Cherry (November 18, 1936 – October 19, 1995) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and multi-instrumentalist. Beginning in the late 1950s, he had a long tenure performing in the bands of saxophonist Ornette Coleman, including on the pioneering free jazz albums &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; (1959) and &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot; (1961). Cherry also collaborated separately with musicians including John Coltrane, Charlie Haden, Sun Ra, Ed Blackwell, the New York Contemporary Five, and Albert Ayler.

Cherry released his debut album as bandleader, &quot;Complete Communion&quot;, in 1966. In the 1970s, he became a pioneer in world music, with his work drawing on African, Middle Eastern, and Hindustani music. He was a member of the ECM group Codona, along with percussionist Naná Vasconcelos and sitar and tabla player Collin Walcott. Chris Kelsey of AllMusic called Cherry &quot;one of the most influential jazz musicians of the late 20th century.&quot;

==Early life==
Cherry was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to a mother of Choctaw descent and an African-American father. His mother and grandmother played piano and his father played trumpet. His father owned Oklahoma City&#x27;s Cherry Blossom Club, which hosted performances by jazz musicians Charlie Christian and Fletcher Henderson. In 1940, Cherry moved with his family to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, where his father tended bar at the Plantation Club on Central Avenue, at the time the center of a vibrant jazz scene. Cherry recalled skipping school at Fremont High School in order to play with the swing band at Jefferson High School. This resulted in his transfer to Jacob Riis High School, a reform school, where he met drummer Billy Higgins.

==Career==
By the early 1950s Cherry was playing with jazz musicians in Los Angeles, sometimes acting as pianist in Art Farmer&#x27;s group. While trumpeter Clifford Brown was in Los Angeles with Max Roach, Cherry attended a jam session with Brown and Larance Marable at Eric Dolphy&#x27;s house, and Brown informally mentored Cherry. He also toured with saxophonist James Clay.

Cherry became well known in 1958 when he performed and recorded with Ornette Coleman, first in a quintet with pianist Paul Bley and later in the quartet which recorded for Atlantic Records. During this period, &quot;his lines ... gathered much of their freedom of motion from the free harmonic structures.&quot; Cherry co-led &quot;The Avant-Garde&quot; session which saw John Coltrane replacing Coleman in the quartet, recorded and toured with Sonny Rollins, was a member of the New York Contemporary Five with Archie Shepp and John Tchicai, and recorded and toured with both Albert Ayler and George Russell. His first recording as a leader was &quot;Complete Communion&quot; for Blue Note Records in 1965. The band included Coleman&#x27;s drummer Ed Blackwell as well as saxophonist Gato Barbieri, whom he had met while touring Europe with Ayler, and bassist Henry Grimes.

After leaving Coleman&#x27;s quartet, Cherry often played in small groups and duets, many with ex-Coleman drummer Ed Blackwell, during a long sojourn in Scandinavia and other locations. He traveled through Europe, India, Morocco, South Africa, and elsewhere to explore and play with a variety of musicians. In the late 1960s he settled in Tågarp, Sweden with his wife, Swedish designer and textile artist Moki Cherry. In 1968, Don Cherry taught music classes with guest lecturers, performance collaborators, and workshop leaders from around the world at Arbetarnas bildningsförbund (ABF) House, a Swedish labor movement-run education center. For ten years, Don and Moki Cherry lived and worked collaboratively in an abandoned schoolhouse in Tågarp, holding classes and performances, hosting guests and collaborators, and exploring their concept of Organic Music Society.

In 1969, Cherry played trumpet and other instruments for poet Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s 1970 LP &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;, a musical adaptation of William Blake&#x27;s poetry collection of the same name. He appeared on Coleman&#x27;s 1971 LP &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, and from 1976 to 1987 reunited with Blackwell and fellow Coleman alumni Dewey Redman and Charlie Haden as Old and New Dreams. Old and New Dreams recorded four albums (two for ECM and two for Black Saint) where Cherry&#x27;s &quot;subtlety of rhythmic expansion and contraction&quot; was noted.

In the 1970s, Cherry ventured into the developing genre of world fusion music. Cherry incorporated influences of Middle Eastern, African, and Indian music into his playing. He studied Indian music with Vasant Rai in the early seventies. From 1978 to 1982, he recorded three albums for ECM with &quot;world jazz&quot; group Codona, consisting of Cherry, percussionist Naná Vasconcelos and sitar and tabla player Collin Walcott.

Cherry also collaborated with classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki on the 1971 album &quot;Actions&quot;. In 1973, he co-composed the score for Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s film &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, together with Jodorowsky and Ronald Frangipane.

At the end of the 1970s, the trio Organic Music Theater (with Gian Piero Pramaggiore and Naná Vasconcelos) had an intense live activity in Italy and France.

In 1982, Cherry released the duet album &quot;El Corazon&quot; with Ed Blackwell. He also released two albums as a bandleader in the 1980s: &quot;Home Boy (Sister Out)&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Art Deco&quot; in 1988. He recorded again with the original Ornette Coleman Quartet on the first disc of Coleman&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;In All Languages&quot;.

Other playing opportunities in his career came with Carla Bley&#x27;s 1971 opera &quot;Escalator over the Hill&quot; and as a sideman on recordings by Lou Reed, Ian Dury, Rip Rig + Panic, and Sun Ra.

In 1994, Cherry appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;, on a track titled &quot;Apprehension&quot;, alongside the Watts Prophets. This album, meant to raise awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among African-Americans, was named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Cherry died of liver cancer in Málaga, Spain, on October 19, 1995, at the age of 58.

Cherry was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Family and personal life==
Cherry was married to Monika Karlsson (Moki Cherry), a Swedish painter and textile artist, who also occasionally played tanpura with him. His stepdaughter Neneh Cherry, his step-granddaughters Mabel and Tyson, and his sons David Ornette Cherry, Christian Cherry, and Eagle-Eye Cherry, are also musicians. David Ornette Cherry died from an asthma attack at the age of 64 on November 20, 2022.

Don Cherry practiced Vajrayana Buddhism. 

==Instruments==
Cherry learned to play various brass instruments in high school. Throughout his career, he played pocket cornet (though he identified this as a pocket trumpet), trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn, and bugle.

Cherry began his career as a pianist, and continued playing piano and organ as secondary instruments throughout his career.

After returning from a musical and cultural journey through Africa, he often played the &quot;donso ngoni&quot;, a harp-lute with a gourd body originating from West Africa (see &quot;ngoni&quot;). During his international journeys, Cherry also collected a variety of non-Western instruments, which he mastered and often played in performances and on recordings. Among these instruments were berimbau, bamboo flutes and assorted percussion instruments.

==Technique and style==
Cherry&#x27;s trumpet influences included Miles Davis, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, and Harry Edison. Journalist Howard Mandel suggests Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen as a precedent (given Allen&#x27;s &quot;blustery rather than Armstrong-brazen brass sound, jauntily unpredictable melodic streams, squeezed-off and/or half-valve effects and repertoire including novelty vocals&quot;) while Ekkehard Jost cites Wild Bill Davison.

Some critics have noted shortcomings in Cherry&#x27;s technique. Ron Wynn writes that &quot;[Cherry&#x27;s] technique isn&#x27;t always the most efficient; frequently, his rapid-fired solos contain numerous missed or muffed notes. But he&#x27;s a master at exploring the trumpet and cornet&#x27;s expressive, voice-like properties; he bends notes and adds slurs and smears, and his twisting solos are tightly constructed and executed regardless of their flaws.&quot; Jost notes the tendency for writers to focus on Cherry&#x27;s &quot;technical insecurity&quot;, but asserts that &quot;the problem lies elsewhere. Perfect technical control in extremely fast tempos was more or less risk-free as long as the improviser had to deal with standard changes that were familiar to him from years of working with them... In the music of the Ornette Coleman Quartet—a &#x27;new-found-land&#x27; where the laws and habits of functional harmony do not apply—there is no use for patterns that had been worked out on that basis.&quot;

Miles Davis was initially dismissive of Cherry&#x27;s playing, claiming that &quot;anyone can tell that guy&#x27;s not a trumpet player—it&#x27;s just notes that come out, and every note he plays he looks serious about, and people will go for that, especially white people.&quot; According to Cherry, however, when Davis attended an Ornette Coleman performance at the Five Spot Café in Greenwich Village, he was impressed with Cherry&#x27;s playing and sat in with the group using Cherry&#x27;s pocket trumpet. Later, in a 1964 &quot;DownBeat&quot; blindfold test, Davis indicated that he liked Cherry&#x27;s playing.

<doc id="225247" wikidata="Q158208" url="?curid=225247" title="Count of St. Germain">
<text>The Count of St. Germain (French: Comte de Saint Germain; ; – 27 February 1784) whose real name and origins remain unknown, was a European adventurer who had interests and achievements in science, alchemy, philosophy, and the arts. He rose to prominence in the European high society of the mid-18th century due to his works and interests. He associated himself with some of the top contemporary figures, including Casanova, Voltaire and Mozart.

The count used a variety of names and titles, including the Marquess of Montferrat (Fr. &quot;Marquis de Montferrat&quot;), Count Bellamarre (Fr. &quot;Comte Bellamarre&quot;), Knight Schoening (Fr. &quot;Chevalier Schoening&quot;), Count Weldon, Count Soltikoff (Fr. &quot;Comte Soltikoff&quot;), Manuel Doria, Graf Tzarogy, and Prince Ragoczy (De. &quot;Prinz Ragoczy&quot;). He appears to have begun to be known under the title of the Count of St Germain during the early 1740s.

He is said to have made far-fetched claims (such as being 500 years old), leading Voltaire to dub him &quot;the Wonderman&quot;, and that &quot;he is a man who does not die, and who knows everything&quot;. Charles, the prince of Hesse-Kassel, is recorded as having called him &quot;one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived&quot;.

== Origins ==
The count&#x27;s birth and background remain obscure; nothing is known with certainty of his origins. Toward the end of his life, he claimed to be the son of Francis II Rákóczi, the prince of Transylvania; while without hard evidence, this would account for his wealth and evident fine education.

The will of Francis II mentions Leopold George, his eldest son, who was believed to have died at the age of four. It has been speculated that his identity was falsified to protect against persecution from the Habsburgs. At the time of his arrival in Schleswig in 1779, he told Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel that he was 88 years old, making his year of birth 1691, when Francis II was 15 years old.

St. Germain was supposedly educated in Italy by Gian Gastone, the grand duke of Tuscany and allegedly his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law. He was believed to be a student at the University of Siena.

Throughout his adult life, he deliberately concealed his actual name and origins, using a multitude of pseudonyms in the different places he visited.
== Career ==

=== England ===
According to David Hunter, the count contributed some of the songs to &quot;L&#x27;incostanza delusa&quot;, an opera performed at the Haymarket Theatre in London on all but one of the Saturdays from 9 February to 20 April 1745. Later, in a letter of December of that same year, Horace Walpole mentions Count St. Germain as being arrested in London on suspicion of espionage (this was during the Jacobite rebellion of 1745), but released without charge:

The other day they seized an odd man, who goes by the name of Count St. Germain. He has been here these two years, and will not tell who he is, or whence, but professes [two wonderful things, the first] that he does not go by his right name; and the second that he never had any dealings with any woman – nay, nor with any [substitute, i.e. for a woman]. He sings, plays on the violin wonderfully, composes, is mad, and not very sensible. He is called an Italian, a Spaniard, a Pole; somebody that married a great fortune in Mexico, and ran away with her jewels to Constantinople; a priest, a fiddler, a vast nobleman. The Prince of Wales has had an unsatiated curiosity about him, but in vain. However, nothing has been made out against him; he is released; and, what convinces me that he is not a gentleman, stays here, and talks of his being taken up for a spy.
The Count gave two private musical performances in London in April and May 1749. On one such occasion, Lady Jemima Yorke described how she was &quot;very much entertain&#x27;d &quot;by him&quot; or &quot;at him&quot; the whole Time – I mean the Oddness of his Manner which it is impossible not to laugh at, otherwise you know he is very sensible &amp; well-bred in conversation&quot;. She continued: He is an Odd Creature, and the more I see him the more curious I am to know something about him. He is everything with everybody: he talks Ingeniously with Mr Wray, Philosophy with Lord Willoughby, and is gallant with Miss Yorke, Miss Carpenter, and all the Young Ladies. But the Character and Philosopher is what he seems to pretend to, and to be a good deal conceited of: the Others are put on to comply with Les Manieres du Monde, but &quot;that&quot; you are to suppose his real characteristic; and I can&#x27;t but fancy he is a great Pretender in All kinds of Science, as well as that he really has acquired an uncommon Share in some.

Walpole reports that St Germain: spoke Italian and French with the greatest facility, though it was evident that neither was his language; he understood Polish and soon learnt to understand English and talk it a little [...] But Spanish or Portuguese seemed his natural language. Walpole concludes that the Count was &quot;a man of Quality who had been in or designed for the Church. He was too great a musician not to have been famous if he had not been a gentleman&quot;. Walpole describes the Count as pale, with &quot;extremely black&quot; hair and a beard. &quot;He dressed magnificently, [and] had several jewels&quot; and was clearly receiving &quot;large remittances, but made no other figure&quot;.

=== France ===
St. Germain appeared in the French court around 1748. In 1749, he was employed by Louis XV for diplomatic missions.

A mime and English comedian known as Mi&#x27;Lord Gower impersonated St. Germain in Paris salons. His stories were wilder than the real count&#x27;s (he had advised Jesus, for example). Inevitably, hearsay of his routine got confused with the original.

Giacomo Casanova describes in his memoirs several meetings with the &quot;celebrated and learned impostor&quot;. Of his first meeting, in Paris in 1757, he writes:

The most enjoyable dinner I had was with Madame de Robert Gergi, who came with the famous adventurer, known by the name of the Count de St. Germain. This individual, instead of eating, talked from the beginning of the meal to the end, and I followed his example in one respect as I did not eat, but listened to him with the greatest attention. It may safely be said that as a conversationalist he was unequalled.
St. Germain gave himself out for a marvel and always aimed at exciting amazement, which he often succeeded in doing. He was a scholar, linguist, musician, and chemist, good-looking, and a perfect ladies&#x27; man. For a while he gave them paints and cosmetics; he flattered them, not that he would make them young again (which he modestly confessed was beyond him) but that their beauty would be preserved by means of a wash which, he said, cost him a lot of money, but which he gave away freely.
He had contrived to gain the favour of Madame de Pompadour, who had spoken about him to the king, for whom he had made a laboratory, in which the monarch – a martyr to boredom – tried to find a little pleasure or distraction, at all events, by making dyes. The king had given him a suite of rooms at Chambord, and a hundred thousand francs for the construction of a laboratory, and according to St. Germain the dyes discovered by the king would have a materially beneficial influence on the quality of French fabrics.
This extraordinary man, intended by nature to be the king of impostors and quacks, would say in an easy, assured manner that he was three hundred years old, that he knew the secret of the Universal Medicine, that he possessed a mastery over nature, that he could melt diamonds, professing himself capable of forming, out of ten or twelve small diamonds, one large one of the finest water without any loss of weight. All this, he said, was a mere trifle to him. Notwithstanding his boastings, his bare-faced lies, and his manifold eccentricities, I cannot say I thought him offensive. In spite of my knowledge of what he was and in spite of my own feelings, I thought him an astonishing man as he was always astonishing me.

=== Dutch Republic ===
In March 1760, at the height of the Seven Years&#x27; War, St. Germain travelled to The Hague. In Amsterdam, he stayed at the bankers Adrian and Thomas Hope and pretended he came to borrow money for Louis XV with diamonds as collateral. He assisted Bertrand Philip, Count of Gronsveld starting a porcelain factory in Weesp as furnace and colour specialist. St. Germain tried to open peace negotiations between Britain and France with the help of Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg. British diplomats concluded that St. Germain had the backing of the Duc de Belle-Isle and possibly of Madame de Pompadour, who were trying to outmanoeuvre the French Foreign Minister, the pro-Austrian Duc de Choiseul. However, Britain would not treat with St. Germain unless his credentials came directly from the French king. The Duc de Choiseul convinced Louis XV to disavow St. Germain and demand his arrest. Count Bentinck de Rhoon, a Dutch diplomat, regarded the arrest warrant as internal French politicking, in which Holland should not involve itself. However, a direct refusal to extradite St. Germain was also considered impolitic. De Rhoon, therefore, facilitated the departure of St. Germain to England with a passport issued by the British Ambassador, General Joseph Yorke. This passport was made out &quot;in blank&quot;, allowing St. Germain to travel in May 1760 from Hellevoetsluis to London under an assumed name, showing that this practice was officially accepted at the time.

From St. Peterburg, St. Germain travelled to Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Ubbergen, and Zutphen (June 1762), Amsterdam (August 1762), Venice (1769), Livorno (1770), Neurenberg (1772), Mantua (1773), The Hague (1774), and Bad Schwalbach.

=== Literary works ===
Discounting the snippets of political intrigue, a few musical pieces, and one mystical poem, there are only two pieces of writing attributed to the Count: &quot;La Très Sainte Trinosophie&quot; and the untitled The Triangular Book of St. Germain (The Triangular Manuscript).

The first book attributed to the Count of Saint Germain is &quot;La Très Sainte Trinosophie&quot;, a beautifully illustrated 18th century manuscript that describes in symbolic terms a journey of spiritual initiation or an alchemical process, depending on the interpretation. This book has been published several times, most notably by Manly P. Hall, in Los Angeles, California, in 1933. The attribution to St. Germain rests on a handwritten note scrawled inside the cover of the original manuscript stating that this was a copy of a text once in St. Germain&#x27;s possession. However, despite Hall&#x27;s elaborate introduction describing the Count&#x27;s legend, The Most Holy Trinosophia shows no definitive connection to him.

The second work attributed to St. Germain is the untitled 18th century manuscript in the shape of a triangle. The two known copies of the Triangular Manuscript exist as Hogart Manuscript 209 and 210 (MS 209 and MS 210). Both currently reside in the Manly Palmer Hall Collection of Alchemical Manuscripts at the Getty Research Library. Nick Koss decoded and translated this manuscript in 2011 and it was published as &quot;The Triangular Book of St. Germain&quot; by Ouroboros Press in 2015. Unlike the first work, it mentions St. Germain directly as its originator. The book describes a magical ritual by which one can perform the two most extraordinary feats that characterized the legend of Count of St. Germain, namely procurement of great wealth and extension of life.

== Final days ==
The count arrived in Altona, Schleswig, in 1779, where he made an acquaintance with Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, both of whom had an interest in mysticism. Charles was a member of several secret societies including the Bavarian Illuminati and a Secret Society of Freesmiths. The count showed Charles several of his gems and convinced him that he had invented a new method of colouring cloth. Charles, impressed, installed the count in an abandoned factory at Eckernförde which Charles had acquired especially for the count, and supplied the count with the materials and cloths needed to proceed with the project. The two met frequently in the following years, and Charles outfitted a laboratory for alchemical experiments in his nearby summer residence Louisenlund, where they, among other things, cooperated in creating gemstones and jewelry. Charles later recounts in a letter that he was the only person in whom the count truly confided. The count told Charles that he was the son of Francis II Rákóczi, and that he had been 88 years of age when he arrived in Schleswig.

=== Death ===
The count died in his residence in the factory on 27 February 1784 when Charles was staying in Kassel. The death was recorded in the register of the St. Nicolai Church (De. &quot;St. Nicolaikirche&quot;) in Eckernförde. He was buried on 2 March at Eckernförde in a private grave, the cost of which was listed in the accounting books of the church the following day. On 3 April, a little over a month after his death, the mayor and the city council of Eckernförde issued an official proclamation about the auctioning off of the count&#x27;s remaining effects in case no living relative would appear within a designated time period to lay claim on them.

Charles donated the factory to the crown and it was afterward converted into a hospital.

Jean Fuller, during her research in 1988, found that the count&#x27;s estate upon his death was a packet of paid bills, receipts, and quittances; 82 Reichsthalers and 13 shillings in cash; and 29 various groups of items of clothing (gloves, stockings, trousers, shirts, etc.), 14 linen shirts, eight other groups of linen items, and various sundries: razors, buckles, toothbrushes, sunglasses, combs, etc. No diamonds, jewels, gold, or any other riches were listed, nor were kept cultural items from travels, personal items (like his violin), or any notes of correspondence.

==== Biographies ====
The best-known biography is Isabel Cooper-Oakley&#x27;s &quot;The Count of St. Germain&quot; (1912), which gives a satisfactory biographical sketch. It is a compilation of letters, diaries, and private records written about the count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Another interesting biographical sketch can be found in &quot;The History of Magic&quot;, by Eliphas Levi, originally published in 1913.

Numerous French and German biographies also have been published, among them &#x27; by Peter Krassa, &#x27; by Marie-Raymonde Delorme, and &quot;&quot; by Pierre Ceria and François Ethuin. In his work &quot;Sages and Seers&quot; (1959), Manly Palmer Hall refers to the biography &quot;Graf St.-Germain&quot; by E. M. Oettinger (1846).

==== Fiction ====

=== In theosophy ===
The count, also sometimes referred to as Master Rákóczi or Master R, is seen as a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various Theosophical and post-Theosophical teachings, said to be responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius and identified with the Count Saint Germain (&quot;fl.&quot; 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a courtier, adventurer, inventor, alchemist, pianist, violinist, and amateur composer.

Some write that the name St. Germain invented for himself was a French version of the Latin &quot;Sanctus Germanus&quot;, meaning &quot;Holy Brother&quot;. In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the &quot;Master R&quot;, or the &quot;Master Rákóczi&quot;, is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.
====Biographies====
There are several &quot;authoritative&quot; biographers on St. Germain who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are Isabel Cooper-Oakley&#x27;s &quot;The Count of St. Germain&quot; (1912), and Jean Overton-Fuller&#x27;s &quot;The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy&quot; (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries, and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century.

Raymond Bernard&#x27;s book &quot;The Great Secret – St. Germain&quot; is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count&#x27;s life, including his conflation with Sir Francis Bacon, and the author of the Shakespearean opus. &quot;The Great Secret, Count St. Germain&quot; purports that St. Germain was actually Francis Bacon by birth, and later authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare. Bernard also contends, as does the Saint Germain Foundation in Schaumburg, Illinois, that Francis Bacon was the child of Queen Elizabeth and Lord Dudley but that it was kept quiet. According to this theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family, yet knew of his true birth, and left numerous hints throughout the Shakespearean canon of this, in the form of explicit clues in the text of the plays, in pictures, and in the alleged use of Bacon&#x27;s cipher in the works. Manly Palmer Hall, in his &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot;, describes some of the same attributes as Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them &quot;&quot; by Peter Krassa, &quot;Le Comte de Saint-Germain&quot; by Marie-Raymonde Delorme, and &quot;L&#x27;énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain&quot; by Pierre Ceria and François Ethuin.

====Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain====
Saint Germain is the central figure in a series of books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot; and &quot;The Magic Presence&quot;, written by Guy Ballard as &quot;Godfré Ray King&quot;, describe Saint Germain as an Ascended master, like Jesus, who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, Ballard discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with Theosophy. The third volume, &quot;The &#x27;I AM&#x27; Discourses&quot;, contains material that is foundational to the sacred scriptures of the &quot;I AM&quot; Religious Activity, founded in 1930 – the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the &quot;Green Books&quot;. Another significant work, the &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot;, is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, Rembrandt&#x27;s famous painting at the Frick Collection in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, AKA the Comte de Gabalis, or the Count of the Cabala. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard&#x27;s pen name), wife of Guy Ballard, talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the &quot;I AM&quot; Religious Activity.

====Claimed encounters with Saint Germain====
Several Theosophists and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* Annie Besant said that she met the Count in 1896.
* C. W. Leadbeater claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having brown eyes, olive colored skin, and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, &quot;the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance&quot;. Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a Roman Emperor and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a castle in Transylvania. According to Leadbeater, when performing magical rituals in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears &quot;a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a Roman Emperor; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of Tyrian purple, with on its clasp a seven-pointed star in diamond and amethyst, and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet.&quot;
*David Christopher Lewis, living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on 10 June 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana, and continued to come many times thereafter.
* David Narozny, living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice on 23 May 2014.
* Dorothy Leon, living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* Edgar Cayce, the &quot;Sleeping Prophet&quot;, was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce&#x27;s reply was: &quot;When needed.&quot; (From reading # 254–83 on 14 February 1935.)
* Guy Ballard, founder of the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity, claimed that he met Saint Germain on Mount Shasta in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his &quot;training&quot; and experiences with other Ascended masters in various parts of the world.
* Miroslav Zimmer, living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Malá Fatra mountains in Slovakia in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* Peter Mt. Shasta, living spiritual teacher and author, claims that Saint Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, as well as many other times, some of which encounters he documents in his book.

====Esoteric activities====
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a supernatural being called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an Ascended master. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many magical powers such as the ability to teleport, levitate, walk through walls, and to inspire people by telepathy, among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky&#x27;s death considered him to be a Mahatma, Master of the Ancient Wisdom, or Adept. Helena Blavatsky said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some esoteric groups credit him with inspiring the Founding Fathers to draft the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as providing the design of the Great Seal of the United States.

In New Age beliefs, Saint Germain is associated with the color violet, the jewel amethyst, and the &quot;Maltese cross&quot; rendered in violet (usually the &quot;iron cross style cross patee&quot; version). He is also regarded as the &quot;Chohan of the Seventh Ray&quot;. According to The Theosophical Society, the Seven Rays are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long Astrological Age. Since according to Theosophy, the next Astrological Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &quot;The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius&quot;. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is &quot;The God of Freedom for this system of worlds&quot;. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former Astrological age Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the &quot;Hierarch of the Age of Pisces&quot;.

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called &quot;Master Rakóczi&quot; or the &quot;Master R.&quot; In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi, otherwise known as the Great Divine Director, is regarded as Saint Germain&#x27;s teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters. Alice A. Bailey&#x27;s book &quot;The Externalisation of the Hierarchy&quot; (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain&#x27;s spiritual title is said to be &quot;Lord of Civilization&quot;, and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that &quot;sometime after AD 2025&quot;, Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would &quot;externalise&quot;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in ashrams, surrounded by their disciples.

Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the &quot;manager of the executive council of the Christ&quot;. Theosophists regard &quot;the Master Jesus&quot; and &quot;Christ&quot; as two separate and distinct beings. They believe in the Gnostic Christology espoused by Cerinthus (&quot;fl.&quot; c. 100 CE), according to which &quot;Christ&quot; is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the ministry of Jesus. According to certain Theosophists, &quot;Christ&quot; is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the &quot;executive council of the Christ&quot; is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the Second Coming of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

====Previous incarnations====
According to The Theosophical Society (not to be confused with the United Lodge of Theosophists) and the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain was incarnated as the following. (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain&#x27;s incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.

* Ruler of a Golden Age civilization centered in a city called &quot;The City of the Sun&quot; 70,000 years ago located in the then-lush and verdant area that is now the Sahara Desert, originally a colony sent out from Atlantis.
* High priest in the civilization of Atlantis 13,000 years ago, serving in the &quot;Order of Lord Zadkiel&quot; in the &quot;Temple of Purification&quot;, located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of Atlantis that had been established on the island now called Cuba.
* Samuel, 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* Hesiod, Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* Plato, Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* Saint Joseph, 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* Saint Alban, late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* Proclus, c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* Merlin. Mythical magician and counselor at King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* Roger Bacon, c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named &quot;Christian Rosenkreuz&quot; was inspired by his efforts.
* Christopher Columbus, 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in the Americas in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain.
* Francis Bacon, 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, author of the Shakespearean plays (according to the Ascended Master Teachings), father of inductive science, and herald of the scientific revolution.

====Ascension into masterhood====
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon faked his own death on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and even attended his own funeral in disguise. It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to Transylvania (then part of Hungary, now part of Romania) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the noble family of Hungary. Finally, on 1 May 1684, he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of alchemy) his physical Ascension (attaining immortality and eternal youth—the sixth level of Initiation), at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name &quot;Saint Germain&quot;.

===Skeptical view===
The scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the &quot;Masters&quot; that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors.

Also see the article &quot;Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements&quot; by Paul Zweig, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s revelations were fraudulent.

<text>Hannah Szenes (often anglicized as Hannah Senesh or Chanah Senesh; ; ; 17 July 1921 – 7 November 1944) was a Hungarian Jewish poet and a Special Operations Executive (SOE) member. She was one of 37 Jewish SOE recruits from Mandate Palestine parachuted by the British into Yugoslavia during the Second World War to assist anti-Nazi forces and ultimately in the rescue of Hungarian Jews about to be deported to the German death camp at Auschwitz.

Szenes was arrested at the Hungarian border by Hungarian gendarmes. She was imprisoned and tortured, but refused to reveal details of her mission. She was eventually tried and executed by firing squad. She is regarded as a national hero in Israel but has largely been forgotten in her birthplace of Hungary according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In Israel her poetry is widely known and the Yad Hana kibbutz, as well as several streets, are named after her.

== Early life ==

Szenes was born in Budapest on 17 July, 1921, to an assimilated Jewish family in Hungary. Her father, Béla, a well known journalist and playwright, died when she was a child. She continued to live with her mother, Catherine, and her brother, György.

She enrolled in a Protestant private school for girls that also accepted Catholic and Jewish pupils; however those of the Catholic and Jewish faiths had to pay double and three times the amount Protestants paid. After her mother thought it was too expensive, Szenes was declared a &quot;gifted student&quot; and allowed to only pay double the usual amount. 

The realization that the situation of the Jews in Hungary was becoming precarious prompted Szenes to embrace Zionism, and she joined &quot;Maccabea&quot;, a Hungarian Zionist youth movement and learned Hebrew.

==Immigration to Nahalal==
Szenes graduated in 1939 and decided to emigrate to Mandatory Palestine in order to study in the Girls&#x27; Agricultural School at Nahalal. In 1941, she joined Kibbutz Sdot Yam and then joined the Haganah, the paramilitary group that laid the foundation of the Israel Defense Forces.

In 1943, she enlisted in the British Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force as an Aircraftwoman 2nd Class. Later the same year, she was recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and was sent to Egypt for parachute training.

==The parachutists’ mission==
Between 1943 and 1944, the Jewish community in Palestine (Yishuv) decided to send Jewish parachutists behind enemy lines to assist both Allied forces and the Jews in occupied Europe. The mission was a cooperation between the Yishuv and British forces to create a Jewish commando unit within the British army. Szenes volunteered and was selected along with 32 others, out of 250 candidates, to be sent on active missions.

==Arrest and torture==
On March 14, 1944, she and two colleagues were parachuted into Yugoslavia and joined a partisan group. After landing, they learned the Germans had already occupied Hungary, so the men decided to call off the mission as too dangerous.

Szenes continued on and headed for the Hungarian border. At the border, she and her companions were arrested by Hungarian gendarmes, who found her British military transmitter, used to communicate with the SOE and other partisans. She was taken to a prison, stripped, tied to a chair, then whipped and clubbed for three days. She lost several teeth as a result of the beatings.

The guards wanted to know the code for her transmitter so they could find out who the parachutists were and trap others. Transferred to a Budapest prison, Szenes was repeatedly interrogated and tortured, but only revealed her name and refused to provide the transmitter code, even when her mother was also arrested. They threatened to kill her mother if she did not cooperate, but she refused.

==Trial and execution==

She was tried for treason in Hungary on 28 October 1944 by a court appointed by the fascist Arrow Cross regime. There was an eight-day postponement to give the judges more time to find a verdict, followed by another postponement, this one because of the appointment of a new Judge Advocate. She was executed by a firing squad on November 7, 1944.
She kept diary entries until her last day. One of them read: &quot;In the month of July, I shall be twenty-three/I played a number in a game/The dice have rolled. I have lost,&quot; and another: &quot;I loved the warm sunlight.&quot;

Her diary was published in Hebrew in 1946. Her remains were brought to Israel in 1950 and buried in the cemetery on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. Her tombstone was brought to Israel in November 2007 and placed in Sdot Yam.

During the trial of Rudolf Kastner, who was a controversial figure involved in negotiating with the Nazis to save a number of Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust, Szenes&#x27;s mother testified that during the time her daughter was imprisoned, Kastner&#x27;s people had advised her not to obtain a lawyer for her daughter. Further, she recalled a conversation with Kastner after the war, telling him, &quot;I don&#x27;t say that you could have saved my daughter Hannah, but that you didn&#x27;t try – it makes it harder for me that nothing was done.&quot;

After the Cold War, a Hungarian military court officially exonerated her. Her kin in Israel were informed on November 5, 1993.

==Poetry, songs and plays==
Szenes was a poet and playwright, writing both in Hungarian and Hebrew. The best known of these is &quot;A Walk to Caesarea&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Eli, Eli&quot; (&quot;My God, My God&quot;). The well-known melody was composed by David Zahavi. Many singers have sung it, including Ofra Haza, Regina Spektor, and Sophie Milman. It was used to close some versions of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.

<text>The 1997 Ruby standoff, sometimes referred to as &quot;Ruby Ridge&quot;, was a standoff that occurred over the course of 39 days from September 22 to October 31, 1997 in Ruby, Illinois, involving law enforcement and Shirley Allen, a 51-year-old woman resisting involuntary commitment. It is one of the longest single-person standoffs in history, and was the longest standoff in the history of the Illinois State Police. The standoff was the subject of a minor media circus in late 1997, and Allen was supported by libertarians and the American militia movement, some of whom traveled to Ruby to support her. The only casualty of the standoff was a police dog that was shot and wounded by Allen.

== Background ==
Shirley Ann Allen (born 1946–47) is a retired nurse who lived in a two-story farmhouse in Ruby, an unincorporated area of Christian County, Illinois, approximately 20 miles southeast of Springfield. In 1989, Allen&#x27;s husband, John, died of pancreatic cancer in her living room, leaving her alone. His death deeply affected her, and she began exhibiting severe paranoia, believing she was being watched by helicopters that spoke to her and that items in her house kept moving or disappearing.

Allen&#x27;s family became increasingly concerned with her delusions and erratic behavior. On Labor Day 1997, Allen&#x27;s mother and sister tried to visit her but were rebuffed; when a concerned friend tried to help them, she threatened to &quot;blow his head off&quot;. Convinced she needed psychiatric care, Allen&#x27;s family asked the district attorney for help, and the court ordered Allen into involuntary commitment in Springfield.

Allen supporters, including one of her close friends, claim that Allen&#x27;s mental decline had been exaggerated by her family and that they sought her institutionalization to gain ownership over her 47-acre property, which contained two oil wells.

== Standoff ==
On September 22, 1997, three Christian County Sheriff&#x27;s Office deputies arrived at Allen&#x27;s house to serve the commitment papers. Accompanying the deputies was Byron Dugger, Allen&#x27;s brother. When the deputies knocked on her door, Allen answered holding a bolt action shotgun. The deputies and Duggan retreated to call for assistance from the Illinois State Police (ISP), who surrounded her property and initiated a standoff. ISP Director Terrance W. Gainer chose to simply wait for Allen to surrender, and stated police were &quot;there for this woman&#x27;s protection and for the protection of her neighbors. I think we&#x27;re doing the right thing. We can&#x27;t afford not to.&quot;

Over the course of the siege, which lasted 39 days, sheriff&#x27;s deputies and state troopers tried numerous methods to coax Allen out of her house. At first, deputies fired 40 mm tear gas rounds into her house, hoping to smoke her out; however, Allen, familiar with the effects of tear gas from her medical career, covered herself in petroleum jelly and a wet towel, protecting her from the irritants in the gas. Attempts at using rubber bullets to stun her also failed, as she wore several layers of clothing stuffed with pillows and magazines, as well as multiple hats, ensuring they had little effect. When a police dog was sent to distract and calm Allen, she fired at it with her shotgun, wounding it. The utilities to Allen&#x27;s property were also cut, again to little effect: she was using battery-powered devices, subsided on a preexisting stockpile of canned food, and had already been relying on bottled water after her property&#x27;s well ran dry.

Allen fired two shots over the course of the siege, but otherwise she stayed quiet inside her house for the majority of it, rarely venturing out onto her deck. Attempts at negotiating with her failed, as she refused to communicate with anyone outside her house. After several weeks of no progress, Gainer decided the best course of action was to have police withdraw from sight and monitor her from a distance, in the hopes that Allen would calm down and &quot;resume a normal, unarmed routine&quot;. In an apparent attempt to &quot;soothe her&quot;, police began to blare classical music and songs by Barry Manilow (apparently her favorite genre and music artist respectively) over speakers toward Allen&#x27;s house. Hidden cameras were also placed on her property, including one hidden in a bucket on her back porch, but Allen would notice them and cut their wires, disabling them.

As the standoff dragged on, police presence and actions began to frustrate Ruby residents, as well as libertarians and militiamen from across the United States, and a small but vocal group of Allen sympathizers emerged. Several supporters traveled to Ruby to show their support for Allen and hold rallies demanding police leave her alone. Some people tried to get a closer look to see what was going on or, in the case of one onlooker who camped outside police barricades for most of the siege, to ensure police did not harm or abuse her. One neighbor was arrested for trying to sneak onto Allen&#x27;s property to deliver her food and water, while others paid her bills for her. Opposing the Allen sympathizers were critics who believed police should have stormed Allen&#x27;s property or fired back whenever she shot, citing the length and high cost of the siege—reportedly over $650,000, much more than the ISP&#x27;s budget for security at the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Supporters and the media coined a nickname for the standoff: &quot;Ruby Ridge&quot;, evoking the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff in Idaho that was a cause célèbre for the militia movement, although police discouraged its use.

In an attempt to calm Allen&#x27;s supporters, Gainer contacted J.J. Johnson, a former militia leader, and Jack McLamb, a former police officer who was present at the Ruby Ridge standoff, who had both traveled to Ruby to protest the police siege. After Gainer met with them and discussed his perspective, Johnson and McLamb came around to understand police actions, but their attempts at expressing this at a rally led to the protestors labeling them traitors. Responding to criticisms of excessive time and cost, Gainer explained that while it would probably have been justifiable to raid Allen&#x27;s property early, they would simply be criticized for being aggressive instead, and that he was willing to be patient if it meant Allen&#x27;s life would be at less risk.

=== End of standoff ===
On October 31, around noon, police heard what they believed was Allen loading her shotgun, and advanced to her house. She stepped onto her back porch twice to leave out trays of food and water that police had regularly left for her. She then stepped out a third time to cut the bucket camera&#x27;s wire, but struggled to do so. A trooper positioned near her porch saw the glint of the scissors in Allen&#x27;s hand and, believing it was a firearm, fired six rubber bullets at her, striking her with three bullets in her leg, side, and chest. Allen fell to the ground, where she was subdued and detained in plastic handcuffs.

After being handcuffed, Allen was consoled by a trooper and led to the front of her house, where she conversed with police and relatives. She reportedly &quot;slipped in and out of rational conversation&quot;, during which she claimed there were helicopters telling her to stay inside, and made her relatives open their mouths so she could see their teeth and lips to ensure they were not wearing masks. When police learned that she had not consumed anything in three days, they offered her a drink, but Allen refused, claiming the helicopters were insisting it was poisonous; after a trooper and Allen&#x27;s relatives each took a sip to confirm it was not poisoned, Allen drank the entire jug. After 45 minutes, Allen was carried on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance that took her to St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Springfield, where she was assessed to be in good condition.

Inside Allen&#x27;s house, police found that it was &quot;neat and tidy&quot; aside from windows that had been broken by police over the course of the standoff. Allen had been sleeping in her living room, where John had died, and kept her shotgun on a table there. She also had two battery-powered radios tuned to WUIS, the NPR station in Springfield, that was coincidentally the only media outlet in the area Gainer had not contacted about the standoff. Gainer was satisfied with the peaceful end to the standoff, as was Governor Jim Edgar, many Ruby residents, and even some Allen sympathizers who had expected a worse conclusion.

== Aftermath ==
Allen was not charged with any crimes, but she was billed approximately $20,000 for each day that the standoff lasted. The ISP agreed to pay for her broken windows alongside any damage police had inflicted to her property during the standoff. Allen was transferred to the custody of the Andrew McFarland Mental Health Center. On December 16, after 47 days of hospitalization, she was released back to her home in Ruby awaiting a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation to determine if she required further commitment, after doctors declared she did not pose a significant threat. As of 2007, she was reported to still be living in her same house in Ruby.

The standoff drew national attention as one of the longest standoffs involving a single suspect in history. Political controversies over the cost of the operation and involuntary commitment laws ensued. The Libertarian Party called for reform of Illinois mental health laws that provide for the hospitalization of people who do not break the law.

<doc id="225252" wikidata="Q1027280" url="?curid=225252" title="Hannah Snell">
<text>Hannah Snell (23 April 1723 – 8 February 1792) was an English woman who disguised herself as a man to join the British military. Snell was mentioned in James Woodforde&#x27;s diary entry of 21 May 1778 selling buttons, garters, and laces.

== Early life ==
Hannah Snell was born in Worcester, England, on 23 April 1723. She was the youngest daughter of the family, with eight siblings. Her father Samuel Snell was a hosier and dyer. Due to Snell&#x27;s grandfather’s service in the military and the money that they inherited from him, her father and his second wife, Mary Williams, were wealthy enough to live comfortably and provide adequate education for all their children. In spite of this, Snell learned to read but never learned to write. She was refer to as the &quot;young Amazon Snell&quot; by locals and she often played soldier as a child.

Snell’s parents died when she was 17. She moved to London on 25 December 1740 to live with her older sibling, Susanah, in her house in Wapping. She married James Summs, a Dutch seaman, on 18 January 1744. Summs often sought the company of other women and grew to despise Snell. He used her patrimony to pay for his luxurious lifestyle. They quickly fell into debt and became impoverished. Summs abandoned Snell when she was pregnant with their child, Susanna, who died in infancy.

Snell moved back in with her sibling Susannah and her brother-in-law, James Gray. On 23 November 1745, Snell put on her brother-in-law&#x27;s clothes, assumed his name, and went to Coventry to search for Summs. Later, she learned that her husband had been executed for murder. 

While in Coventry, she enlisted in the British Army. She joined John Guise&#x27;s regiment, the 6th Regiment of Foot.

== Military career ==
Hannah Snell joined the military when she was 25 years old under her brother-in-law&#x27;s identity, James Gray. She joined the regiment of general John Guise in 1747, where she received training in military exercises and greatly excelled. During this time, she had a falling out with a sergeant in her regiment named Davis who accused Gray of neglecting her duties. This incident was prompted due to Gray&#x27;s refusal to facilitate a sexual encounter between Davis and a local woman. For this accused neglect, Gray was sentenced to “600 lashes&quot; and received 500 while tied to the gate of Carlisle Castle. In Robert Walker&#x27;s biography on her life, it is mentioned that she eluded discovery due to the manner in which her arms were tied to the gate as well as the small size of her breasts.

After these events, Snell deserted and went to join the Royal Marines. She boarded the sloop HMS &quot;Swallow&quot; at Portsmouth and sailed as a cabin boy under commander John Rowzier to Lisbon. Her unit was to invade French Mauritius as part of the War of the Austrian Succession, but the attack was called off. Her unit then sailed to India to take part in the First Carnatic War. In August 1748, her unit was sent to an unsuccessful expedition to besiege the French colony of Pondicherry in India. Later, she fought in a battle at Devicottah in June 1749. She was injured a total of 11 times, with one shot in her groin and five in her leg. After the battle, she was sent to a hospital at Cuddalore, where she was seen by two physicians. To avoid revealing her sex, she either removed the bullet herself or was assisted by a local woman, instead of being tended by the regimental surgeon.

After her three-month recovery, she was reunited with her fleet and returned to duty on the undermanned ship. She then spent five weeks in Bombay where her crewmates noticed that she did not shave her face and nicknamed her &quot;Miss Molly Gray&quot;. This prompted her to &quot;begin flirting with the local women&quot; as a way to reduce suspicion about her sex. Shortly thereafter, Gray returned home to England after being discharged for complications with her wounds.

In 1750, her unit returned to Britain and travelled from Portsmouth to London, where she revealed her sex to her shipmates on 2 June. She petitioned Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, the head of the army, for her pension. She also sold her story to London publisher Robert Walker, who published her account, &quot;The Female Soldier&quot;, in two different editions. She also began to appear on stage in their uniform presenting military drills and singing songs. Three painters painted her portrait in her uniform and &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported her claims. She was honorably discharged and the Royal Hospital Chelsea officially recognized Snell&#x27;s military service in November, and granted her a pension in 1750 (increased in 1785), which was rare at the time.

== Later life ==

Sources claim that after receiving her pension, Snell retired to Wapping and kept a pub named either &quot;The Female Warrior&quot; or &quot;The Widow in Masquerade&quot;, but it did not last long. By the mid-1750s, Snell was living in Newbury in Berkshire. In 1759, she married Richard Eyles there, with whom she had two children. In 1772, she married Richard Habgood of Welford, also in Berkshire, and the two moved to the Midlands. In 1785, she was living with her child George Spence Eyles, a clerk, on Church Street, Stoke Newington.

In 1791, her mental condition suddenly worsened. She was admitted to Bethlem Hospital on 20 August and died on 8 February 1792. She was buried at Chelsea Hospital (now the Old Burial Ground, Royal Hospital Chelsea).

==Legacy==

Playwright Shirley Gee has written two fictional dramatizations of Snell&#x27;s life: a radio play, &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (1988) and a stage play, &quot;Warrior&quot; (1989).

Hannah Snell is mentioned in the 1969 film &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; as a woman who was prepared to &quot;serve, suffer and sacrifice.&quot;

There are numerous accounts of Snell’s life. Snell’s memoir &quot;The Female Sailor&quot; was released in 1750 by London publisher Robert Walker. It has continued to be in circulation even to the present day, available in the following books: &quot;The Female Soldier; Or, The Surprising Life and Adventures of Hannah Snell&quot; (2011)&quot;, The Lady Tars: The Autobiographies of Hanna Snell, Mary Lacy, Mary Talbot, and Mary Anne Talbot&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Female Soldier: Two Accounts of Women Who Served &amp; Fought as Men&quot; (2011). Snell’s life is also the subject of further examination. For instance, &quot;Hannah Snell: The Secret Life of a Female Marine&quot; (2014) investigates the context in which her life took place, while &quot;Female Husbands&quot; (2020) discusses themes related to Snell’s and other figures’ &quot;transing&quot; of gender.  

Abbreviated magazine and newspaper accounts of Snell’s life were also widespread both within and beyond England. One such early article was released in a 1750 issue of London’s &quot;The Gentleman’s Magazine&quot;. Records of later 1800s publications show the reach of Snell’s narrative; articles on Snell’s in U.S. magazines and newspapers, for instance, are found in &quot;The New York Ledger&quot; (1865), Boston’s &quot;Ballou’s Dollar Monthly&quot; (1855–1865), Minnesota’s &quot;The St. Paul Globe&quot; (1890), and Utah’s &quot;The Salt Lake Herald&quot; (1893). Snell’s media presence decreased in the 1900s. Documented publications about her during this period, however, were still present in Utah’s &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; (1910) and Oregon&#x27;s &quot;The Gazette-Times&quot; (1914).

The pronouns and gender identity assigned to Snell vary between publications. In Snell’s original 1746 memoir, she referred to herself as &quot;Hannah Snell&quot; and used female pronouns. However, the subsequent 1750 version identified the author as James Gray. Later editions and newspaper articles reverted back to using &quot;Hannah Snell&quot;. Much of the academic work on Snell likewise uses her birth name and pronouns, although papers in transgender studies and related fields have diverged from this norm.

<doc id="225254" wikidata="Q62071" url="?curid=225254" title="Wilhelm Voigt">
<text>Wilhelm Voigt (13 February 1849 – 3 January 1922) was a German con man and impostor. In his most famous exploit, Voigt masqueraded as a military officer of the elite Prussian Guards in 1906, rounding up a number of Imperial German Army soldiers under his &quot;command&quot;, &quot;arresting&quot; the Mayor of Köpenick, and &quot;confiscating&quot; 4,002 marks from the city treasury. Voigt then changed back into civilian clothing and disappeared with the money. The case was exploited for British propaganda about German militarism, but the German people overwhelmingly considered Voigt&#x27;s exploit to be both clever and hilarious. Although Voigt was soon caught and served 20 months in prison, he became a folk hero as &quot;the Captain of Köpenick&quot; ( ) and was granted a full pardon by Kaiser Wilhelm II.

== Early life ==
Voigt was born in Tilsit, Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). In 1863, aged 14, he was sentenced to 14 days in prison for theft, which led to his expulsion from school. He learned shoemaking from his father.

Between 1864 and 1891, Voigt was sentenced to prison for a total of 25 years for thefts, forgery and burglary. The longest sentence was a 15-year conviction for an unsuccessful burglary of a court cashier&#x27;s office. He was released on 12 February 1906.

Voigt drifted from place to place until he went to live with his sister in Rixdorf near Berlin. He was briefly employed by a well-reputed shoemaker until the local police expelled him from Berlin as an undesirable, based solely on his being an ex-convict, on 24 August 1906. Officially he left for Hamburg, although he remained in Berlin as an unregistered resident.

== Captain of Köpenick ==

On 16 October 1906, Voigt was ready for his next caper. He had purchased parts of used Prussian Guards Captain&#x27;s uniforms from different shops and tested their effect on soldiers. He had resigned from the shoe factory ten days previously. He took the uniform out of baggage storage, put it on and went to the local army barracks, stopped four grenadiers and a sergeant on their way back to barracks and told them to come with him and they followed. He dismissed the commanding sergeant to report to his superiors and later commandeered six more soldiers from a shooting range. Then he took a train to Köpenick, east of Berlin, occupied the local city hall with his soldiers and told them to cover all exits. He told the local police to &quot;care for law and order&quot; and to &quot;prevent calls to Berlin for one hour&quot; at the local post office.

He had the treasurer von Wiltberg and mayor Georg Langerhans arrested for political corruption, and confiscated 4002 marks and 37 pfennigs, issuing a receipt for the money signed with his former prison warden&#x27;s name. Then he commandeered two carriages and told the grenadiers to take the arrested men to the Neue Wache in Berlin for interrogation. He told the remaining soldiers to stand in their places for half an hour and then left for the train station, where he changed back into civilian clothes and disappeared with the money.

== Unraveling and capture ==
In the following days, the German press speculated on what had really happened. At the same time the Imperial German Army ran its own investigation. The German people admired both the cleverness and daringness of the culprit.

Voigt was arrested on 26 October 1906 after a former cellmate who knew about Voigt&#x27;s plans had tipped off the police, hoping for a high reward. On 1 December Voigt was sentenced to four years in prison for forgery, impersonating an officer, and false imprisonment. However, much of public opinion was on his side. German Kaiser Wilhelm II pardoned him on 16 August 1908. There are claims that even the Kaiser was amused by the incident, referring to him as an &quot;amiable scoundrel&quot;, and being pleased with the authority and feelings of reverence that his military obviously commanded in the general population.

The British press were also amused, seeing it as confirmation of their stereotypes about German militarism. In its 27 October 1906 issue, the editors of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; noted gleefully:
For years the Kaiser has been instilling into his people reverence for the omnipotence of militarism, of which the holiest symbol is the German uniform. Offences against this fetish have incurred punishment. Officers who have not considered themselves saluted in due form have drawn their swords with impunity on offending privates.
In that same issue, writer G. K. Chesterton pointed out:
The most absurd part of this absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has received comparatively little comment. I mean the point at which the Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, &#x27;These are my authority&#x27;. One would have thought anyone would have known that no soldier would talk like that.
== Aftermath ==

Voigt capitalized on his fame. His wax figure appeared in the wax museum in Unter den Linden four days after his release. He appeared in the museum to sign his pictures, but public officials banned the appearances on the same day.

He appeared in small theatres in a play that depicted his exploit and signed more photographs as the Captain of Köpenick. In spite of the ban he toured in Dresden, Vienna and Budapest in variety shows, restaurants and amusement parks. In 1909, he published a book in Leipzig, &quot;How I became the Captain of Köpenick&quot;, which sold well.

Although his United States tour almost failed because the immigration authorities refused to grant him a visa, he arrived in 1910 via Canada. He also inspired a waxwork in Madame Tussaud&#x27;s museum in London.

In 1910, he moved to Luxembourg and worked as a waiter and shoemaker. He received a life pension from a rich Berlin dowager. Two years later, he bought a house and retired, but was ruined financially in the post–World War I recession. Voigt died in Luxembourg in 1922. His grave is on the Cimetière Notre-Dame in Luxembourg ().

== In popular culture ==

Voigt&#x27;s exploits became the subject of literary references as early as 1911, when British satirical writer Saki defined the term &quot;to koepenick&quot; as &quot;to replace an authority by a spurious imitation that would carry just as much weight for the moment as the displaced original&quot; in his short story &quot;&quot;.

A silent film was made in German in 1926. In 1931, German author Carl Zuckmayer wrote a play about the affair called &quot;The Captain of Köpenick&quot;, which shifts the focus from the event at Köpenick itself to the prelude, showing how his surroundings and his situation in life had helped Voigt form his plan. An English-language adaptation was written by John Mortimer, and first performed by the National Theatre company at the Old Vic on 9 March 1971 with Paul Scofield in the title role.

Several more films were produced about Wilhelm Voigt, most based on Zuckmayer&#x27;s play; among them &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot; (1931); &quot;The Captain from Köpenick&quot; (1945), starring Albert Bassermann; &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot; (1956), with Heinz Rühmann; a 1956 U.S. TV adaptation starring Emmett Kelly, the circus clown; the 1960 TV movie &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot;, featuring Rudolf Platte; and the 1997 TV movie &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot;, starring Harald Juhnke.

In 1943 the Luftwaffe mistakenly thought that an Allied bombing attack which had been carried out on Düren, with the bombers then returning, was a diversion, and the bombers were actually heading for the ball-bearing factory at Schweinfurt. When Schweinfurt was not attacked, they were concerned about the Leuna synthetic fuel refinery, then the Škoda Works in Plzeň. They scrambled large numbers of fighters everywhere, whose engine noise sounded like an invading force. After the debacle, Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring sent an ironic telegram to all concerned congratulating them on &quot;the successful defence of the fortress of Koepenick&quot;.

The basic line of stageplays and movies was the pitiful catch-22 situation of Voigt trying to earn his living honourably in Berlin: &quot;No residence address – no job. No job – no residence (rented room). No residence – no passport. No passport – getting ousted.&quot;

<doc id="225255" wikidata="Q116774" url="?curid=225255" title="Frank Abagnale">
<text>Frank William Abagnale Jr. (; born April 27, 1948) is an American security consultant, author, and convicted felon who committed frauds that mainly targeted individuals and small businesses. He later gained notoriety in the late 1970s by claiming a diverse range of workplace frauds, many of which have since been placed in doubt by one author. In 1980, Abagnale co-wrote his autobiography, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, which built a narrative around these claimed frauds. The book inspired the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002, in which Abagnale was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has also written four other books. Abagnale runs Abagnale and Associates, a consulting firm.

Abagnale claims to have worked as an assistant state attorney general in the U.S. state of Louisiana, served as a hospital physician in Georgia, and impersonated a Pan American World Airways pilot who logged over two million air miles by deadheading. The veracity of most of Abagnale&#x27;s claims has been questioned, and ongoing inquiries continue to confirm that they were fabricated. In 2002, Abagnale admitted on his website that some facts had been overdramatized or exaggerated, though he was not specific about what was exaggerated or omitted about his life. In 2020, journalist Alan C. Logan provided evidence he claims proves the majority of Abagnale&#x27;s story was invented or at best exaggerated. The public records obtained by Logan have since been independently verified by journalist Javier Leiva.

== Early life ==
Frank William Abagnale Jr. was born in the Bronx, New York City, on April 27, 1948, to an Algerian-American mother who died in November 2014, and an Italian-American father who died in March 1972. He spent his early life in Bronxville, New York. His parents separated when he was 12 and divorced when he was 15 years old. After the divorce, Abagnale moved with his father, and his new stepmother, to Mount Vernon, New York.

Abagnale claims his first victim was his father, who gave him a gasoline credit card and a truck, and was ultimately liable for a bill amounting to $3,400. Abagnale was only 15 at the time. In his autobiography, Abagnale says, because of this crime, he was sent to a reform school in Westchester County, New York (fitting the description of the Lincolndale Agricultural School) run by Catholic Charities USA. In numerous interviews, Abagnale has claimed he attended an elite Catholic private school in Westchester, New York, Iona Preparatory School, through the 10th grade at age 16 in 1964. Abagnale is not mentioned by name, though, nor do any photographs of him appear in the Iona Preparatory School yearbooks from the time he ostensibly attended. Moreover, no alumni recall Abagnale ever attending the high school.

In December 1964, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 16. He was discharged after less than three months, and was released on February 18, 1965. Less than two weeks after his release, Abagnale was arrested for petty larceny in Mount Vernon on February 26, 1965. The following month, in March 1965, Abagnale identified himself as a Scarsdale, New York, police officer and entered the apartment of a Mount Vernon, New York, resident claiming that he was investigating her teenaged daughter. Suspicious, the victim called the Mount Vernon police, who found Abagnale with a toy gun and a paper police badge. Abagnale was arrested and booked on a vagrancy charge after being identified in a lineup by the victim. The following day, Abagnale was ordered by the court to be committed to Grasslands psychiatric institute, in Westchester County, for observation.

In June 1965, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Abagnale in Eureka, California, for car theft after he stole a Ford Mustang from one of his father&#x27;s neighbors. Abagnale was pictured in the local newspaper, seated in a car, being questioned by Special Agent Richard Miller of the FBI. He had financed his cross-country trip from New York to California with blank checks stolen from a family business located on the Bronx River Parkway. Abagnale was also charged with impersonating a US customs official, although this charge was subsequently dropped. On July 2, 1965, this stolen-car case was transferred to the Southern District of New York.

=== Airline pilot ===
After being released into the custody of his father to face the stolen-car charges, 17-year-old Abagnale decided to impersonate a pilot. He obtained a uniform at a Manhattan uniform company, purchased with the money he obtained from the forgery of checks and on July 7, 1965, informed local media that he was a graduate of the American Airlines pilot school in Fort Worth, Texas, but he was arrested for theft of checks in Tuckahoe, New York days later. Abagnale was sentenced to three years at the Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York for these stolen checks. After serving only two years of his sentence, he was released into the custody of his mother, but he broke the terms of his parole with a stolen-car conviction in Boston, Massachusetts, and was returned to Great Meadow for one year.

After his release on December 24, 1968, 20-year-old Abagnale disguised himself as a TWA pilot and moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he talked his way into the house of a local music teacher, whose daughter was a Delta Air Lines stewardess he had met in New York. In Baton Rouge, Abagnale also befriended a local minister, claimed he had a master&#x27;s degree in social work from Ithaca College, and sought work with vulnerable youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The reverend introduced him to Louisiana State University faculty, who determined he was an &quot;obvious phony&quot;. The reverend, after Abagnale told him he was a furloughed TWA pilot, became suspicious and called the airline, which informed him that Abagnale was a fraud. The reverend notified the Baton Rouge Police Department, and Abagnale was arrested on February 14, 1969, initially on vagrancy charges. Upon his arrest, he was found to have illegally driven his Florida rental car out of state and to possess falsified airline employee identification. The following day, detectives determined that Abagnale had stolen blank checks from his host family and a local business in Baton Rouge, and he was subsequently charged with theft and forgery. Unable to make bail, he was convicted on June 2, 1969, and was sentenced to 12 years of supervised probation, but he soon fled Louisiana for Europe.

== Europe ==
Two weeks after the Louisiana bench warrant was issued, Abagnale was arrested in Montpellier, France, in September 1969. He had stolen an automobile and defrauded two local families in Klippan, Sweden. He was sentenced to four months for theft in France, though he served only three months in Perpignan&#x27;s prison.

He was then extradited to Sweden, where he was convicted of gross fraud by forgery. He served two months in a Malmö prison, was banned from Sweden for eight years, and was required to compensate his Swedish victims (which he allegedly failed to do). Abagnale was deported back to the United States in June 1970, when his appeal failed.

== United States ==
After returning to the United States, 22-year-old Abagnale dressed in a pilot&#x27;s uniform and traveled around college campuses, passing bad checks and claiming he was there to recruit stewardesses for Pan Am. At the University of Arizona, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, a student at the time, Abagnale conducted physical examinations on several female college students who wanted to be part of flight crews. None of the women were ever enrolled in Abagnale&#x27;s fictional program, as his autobiography and film depict.

After Abagnale cashed a personal check made to look like a Pan Am paycheck, on July 30, 1970, in Durham, North Carolina, he again came to the attention of the FBI. He was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia, three months later, on November 2, 1970, after cashing ten fake Pan Am payroll checks in different towns. Abagnale escaped from the Cobb County jail and was picked up four days later in New York City. He was sentenced to ten years in 1971 for forging checks that totaled $1,448.60 (equivalent to $11,225.45 in 2024), and he received an additional two years for escaping from the local Cobb County jailhouse.

In 1974, Abagnale was released on parole after he had served around two years of his 12-year sentence at Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia. Unwilling to return to his family in New York, Abagnale says he left the choice of parole location up to the court, which decided that he would be paroled in Houston, Texas.

After his release, Abagnale stated that he performed numerous jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist; he was fired from most of those after he was discovered to have been hired without revealing his criminal past. He again posed as a pilot in 1974 to obtain a job at Camp Manison, a summer children&#x27;s camp in Texas, where he was arrested for stealing cameras from his co-workers. After he received only a fine, he obtained a position at a Houston-area orphanage by pretending to be a pilot with a master&#x27;s degree. This job had him finding foster homes for the children living at the orphanage. This ruse was eventually discovered by his parole officer, who swiftly removed him from his orphanage work and moved him into living quarters above his own garage, so he &quot;could keep an eye on him&quot;. His next position was at Aetna, where he was fired and sued for check fraud.

According to Abagnale, he approached a bank with an offer in 1975. He explained to the bank what he had done and offered to speak to the bank&#x27;s staff and show them various tricks that &quot;paperhangers&quot; use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his information helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $50, with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks. With that, he began a new career as a speaker and security consultant. During this time, he falsified his resume to show he had worked with the Los Angeles Police Department and Scotland Yard.

In 1977, Abagnale gave public talks wherein he claimed that between the ages of 16 and 21, he was a pediatrician in a Georgia hospital for one year, an assistant state attorney general for one year, a sociology professor for two semesters, and a Pan American airlines pilot for two years. In addition, Abagnale claimed that he recruited female university students as Pan American flight attendants, traveling with them for three months throughout Europe. He also claimed he eluded the FBI with a daring escape from a commercial airline bathroom via the toilet bowl, while the plane was taxiing at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. In 1978, Abagnale told a &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; reporter that he was familiar with the toilet apparatus, squeezed himself through the opening, swung down through the lower hatch, landed on the pavement, ran across the runway, and hailed a cab. Abagnale claimed he moved the sewage container aside and that no one heard a thing: &quot;I took off running. I thought they were right behind me. What I didn&#x27;t know was that the door was spring loaded and when it slammed shut the whole assembly fell back into place. Nobody heard anything because of the engines&#x27; roar.&quot;

He moved with his wife, Kelly, and their three sons to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He and his family lived in the same house for the next 25 years. After their sons left home for college and careers elsewhere, Kelly suggested that she and Frank leave Tulsa. They decided to move to Charleston, South Carolina.

In 1976, he founded Abagnale &amp; Associates, which advises companies on secure documents. In 2015, Abagnale was named the AARP Fraud Watch Ambassador, where he helps &quot;to provide online programs and community forums to educate consumers about ways to protect themselves from identity theft and cybercrime.&quot; In 2018, he began co-hosting the AARP podcast &quot;The Perfect Scam&quot; about scammers and how they operate.

He has appeared in the media a variety of times, including three times as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, an appearance on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1977, and a regular slot on the British network TV series &quot;The Secret Cabaret&quot; in the 1990s. The book about Abagnale, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, was turned into a movie of the same name by Steven Spielberg in 2002, featuring actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. The real Abagnale made a cameo appearance in this film playing a French police officer taking DiCaprio into custody.

==Veracity of claims==
During his many speeches, appearances and interviews on television, Abagnale has alleged many criminal exploits. These include stating that he was wanted in 26 countries, has worked extensively for the FBI, and escaped several times from FBI custody. He also claimed that he cashed over 17,000 bad checks, amounting to US$2.5 million, and worked as an assistant attorney general and a hospital physician. In addition, he stated that he started a fake stewardess trainee program, traveling with them throughout Europe for two months, and logged over three million air miles disguised as a pilot. Almost all of these claims have been refuted by journalists.

In public lectures describing his life story, Abagnale has consistently maintained that he was &quot;arrested just once,&quot; and that was in Montpellier, France. However, public records show Abagnale was arrested in New York (multiple times), California, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas.

Despite public records showing Abagnale targeted individuals and small family businesses, Abagnale has long claimed publicly that he &quot;never, ever ripped off any individuals.&quot; He made the same claim of never targeting individuals and small businesses to BBC journalist Sarah Montague and the Associated Press. According to Abagnale, the only individual he ever swindled was a Miami prostitute: &quot;She tried to charge me $1,000 for an evening, so I gave her a $1,400 forged cashier&#x27;s check, and got $400 in change.&quot; In 2002, Abagnale told the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;As long as I didn&#x27;t hurt anyone, people never considered me a real criminal, my victims were big corporations. I was a kid ripping off the establishment.&quot;

Individuals criminally targeted by Abagnale, however, have described the long-term consequences of victimization:

His claim that he passed the Louisiana bar examination, worked for Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion, and closed 33 cases, was challenged by several journalists in 1978. No record has been found of Abagnale ever being a member of the Louisiana Bar, and no evidence shows he ever worked as an assistant attorney general in Louisiana&#x27;s Attorney General&#x27;s Office. In 1978, the Louisiana State Bar Association reconciled all those who took the bar exam and concluded that Abagnale never took the exam using his own name or an alias; the State Attorney General&#x27;s Office examined payments to all employees during the time Abagnale claimed he worked there and concluded that he never worked in the office using his name or an alias. After Abagnale appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, then-First Assistant Attorney General Ken DeJean gave a reporter a series of questions to ask Abagnale about the description of then-Attorney General Gremillion. Abagnale failed to answer the questions correctly.

Abagnale claimed that when he was 18 years old, he worked for a year as a supervising pediatrician at the Cobb General Hospital in Marietta, Georgia. He maintained that he worked the midnight-to-8 am shift, supervising seven residents and 42 nurses. Abagnale claimed that he would visit the university library to memorize medical journals and textbooks: &quot;With my photographic memory, I could easily memorize anything. That did not mean that I could comprehend it, but I could rattle it off verbatim.&quot; Abagnale told his audiences that over the course of his one year at Cobb General, no one doubted his position as a physician: &quot;So I made the rounds, picked up the clipboards, scribbled a few lines, initialed them, and everyone thought I was doing a fine job.&quot; However, hospital administrators told journalist Ira Perry that the hospital had no midnight-to-8 am shift, nor did the position of regular overnight pediatrician exist, at the time. Using records from the New York State Archives, author Alan C. Logan demonstrated that Abagnale was in the Great Meadow Prison, in Comstock, New York, when he was 18.

Abagnale&#x27;s claim that he impersonated a doctor is not entirely without foundation, however. On the University of Arizona campus in 1970, he stated that he was a pilot and a doctor. According to Paul Holsen, who was an older university student and licensed commercial pilot at the time, Abagnale informed him that he was there on behalf of Pan Am to recruit and conduct physical examinations on candidates. In his autobiography, Holsen claimed that after Abagnale&#x27;s ruse was discovered, authorities informed him that Abagnale had indeed conducted physical exams on students. University of Arizona officials acknowledge that Abagnale had interacted with 12 female students. Abagnale has openly acknowledged that he performed examinations on young women while impersonating a doctor: &quot;When the girls came by, I always gave them a thorough examination and sent them on their way. I was young, but not stupid.&quot; In 2021, Louisiana State University Manship Chair in Journalism Robert Mann expressed his regret in not confronting Abagnale&#x27;s claim of conducting physical examinations as a doctor: &quot;Looking back on my story about the event [Abagnale&#x27;s lecture], I am embarrassed by what I wrote about Abagnale&#x27;s time posing as a pediatrician. Reading those words now, in which Abagnale bragged about sexual abuse, makes me sick.&quot;

Abagnale has publicly claimed an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 140: &quot;I have an I.Q. of 140 and retain 90% of what I read. So, by studying and memorizing the bar exam, I was able to get the needed score.&quot; In 2021, Abagnale gave the keynote speech at the American Mensa Conference in Houston. The organizers claimed he was the subject of an FBI manhunt and cashed millions of dollars&#x27; worth of checks while impersonating a pilot and doctor. Despite claims of a photographic memory, when queried by &quot;USA Today&quot; journalist Andy Seiler regarding details of his imposter roles and movements in the 1960s, Abagnale responded by saying, &quot;You get to a point in your life where you go, &#x27;I don&#x27;t remember what I did.&#x27;&quot;

One of Abagnale&#x27;s most notable claims was an alleged escape from the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, in 1971:

In 1982, Abagnale told the press, &quot;I was and still am the only and youngest man to escape from that prison.&quot; The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed, though, that Abagnale was never housed in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary: &quot;He was never admitted, so I don&#x27;t really see how he could have escaped,&quot; said acting Warden Dwight Amstutz.

In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anticrime seminar, a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter looked into his assertions. Telephone calls to banks, schools, hospitals, and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale&#x27;s response was, &quot;Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information.&quot; He later said he had changed the names.

Further doubts were raised about Abagnale&#x27;s story after an October 1978 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, with a news article saying:

In December 1978, Abagnale&#x27;s claims were again investigated after he visited Oklahoma City for a talk. As part of his investigation into the story, Perry spoke with Pan Am spokesman Bruce Haxthausen, who responded to the journalists&#x27; inquiry saying:
In 2002, Abagnale addressed the issue of his story&#x27;s lack of truthfulness with a statement posted on his company&#x27;s website, which said in part: &quot;I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also overdramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography.&quot; However, Abagnale made the primary claims of working as a doctor for a year, an attorney for a year, a PhD professor, and his several escapes on national television in 1977 on the show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, which antedated the 1980 autobiography by several years. He also made these claims in print media, namely the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, three years before the publication of his co-written autobiography, effectively nullifying the claim his aforementioned co-author, Stan Redding, exaggerated the story.

Despite Abagnale&#x27;s website claim about his autobiography co-author Stan Redding, investigative journalist Javier Leiva discovered an obscure cover story of &quot;True Detective&quot; (January 1978) in which Abagnale told the story of his life. In &quot;True Detective&quot;, Abagnale claimed to Redding that he passed the Louisiana bar exam, worked as an assistant attorney general, was employed as a sociology professor, worked as an Atlanta pediatrician, escaped from an airplane toilet, escaped from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, recruited University of Arizona students (and traveled with them throughout Europe for weeks), and cashed $2.5 million in checks. These claims antedate, by several years, the co-authored autobiography, and they also demonstrate that it was Abagnale who invented and exaggerated his life story, not Stan Redding.

In 2002, at the &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; film premiere, Abagnale conceded to journalist Andy Seiler of &quot;USA Today&quot; that the impersonations in the autobiography were fabricated: &quot;I impersonated a doctor for a few days, I was a lawyer for a few days. In the book, it&#x27;s like I am doing this for a year.&quot; Despite this admission, in public speeches, Abagnale would return to his claims of long-term impersonations of a doctor and for working for a year as an attorney. Abagnale&#x27;s fees for speaking about his alleged life story are reported to be between $20,000 and $30,000.

In 2006, KSL journalist Scott Haws challenged Abagnale with his claim that he worked as a PhD-holding sociology professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) for two semesters. Abagnale claimed that he could not recall the details, and that his co-author Redding had exaggerated some things. Haws &quot;refreshed Frank&#x27;s memory&quot; and showed him his own words, including the &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; movie book and the credits that rolled at the end of the film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, where Abagnale, not Redding, made the BYU professor claim. Abagnale conceded to Haws that he might have been a guest lecturer.

Leading up to 2020, author Alan C. Logan conducted an in-depth investigation for a book that focused on the perspective of Abagnale&#x27;s victims. As part of this process, Logan combined earlier newspaper articles, numerous administrative documents, and public records that had not been the subject of scrutiny by major media outlets. Based on these documents, Logan provided a timeline that challenged the overall truthfulness of Abagnale&#x27;s self-described criminal history and movements between 1964 and 1974. Logan maintains that his investigation found that Abagnale&#x27;s account of his criminal past is, for the most part, a fabrication. Using records from the New York State Archives, Logan showed that Abagnale was in Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York, between the ages of 17 and 20 (July 26, 1965, and December 24, 1968) as inmate #25367, the time frame during which Abagnale claims to have committed his most significant scams. Logan&#x27;s investigation uncovered numerous petty crimes that Abagnale has never acknowledged. Various media outlets have asked Abagnale to respond to Logan&#x27;s book content, which included victim statements and citations to publicly accessible records. Abagnale has responded by stating that the book is &quot;not worthy of a comment&quot;.

Abagnale has told the press, &quot;I was convicted on $2.5 million dollars&#x27; worth of bad checks&quot; and that he later hired a law firm to get all the money back to hotels and other companies. Federal court records, though, show that Abagnale was convicted of forging 10 Pan American Airlines checks in five states (Texas, Arizona, Utah, California. and North Carolina), totaling less than US$1,500. Following his parole on February 8, 1974, he claimed he went to work for the FBI, but after this date, Abagnale was arrested for theft at a kids&#x27; camp in Friendswood, Texas, on August 29, 1974.

In many interviews and speeches, Abagnale has claimed that he has earned millions of dollars from his patents. The United States Patent and Trademark Office website, to the contrary, does not list Abagnale—as a person—or Abagnale and Associates—as a business—as holders of any patents, and neither are listed as an inventor on any patent. In his cheque design patents, Canadian inventor Calin A. Sandru merely mentions in the Background section of the invention that KPMG and Abagnale and Associates are groups that affirm that cheque fraud is a significant problem.

Logan, girded with public records, shared his findings in detail on the NPR program &quot;Watching America&quot;, August 13, 2021, broadcast on WHRO.

In 2022, investigative journalist Javier Leiva independently obtained the public records first sourced by Logan. Leiva also confirmed that Abagnale was in prison between 17 and 20 and then convicted for theft in Baton Rouge in June 1969. Leiva also obtained the federal records connected to Abagnale&#x27;s Pan Am checks and confirmed that his conviction, at 22 years old, was based on less than $1,500. Leiva says he calculated that between 1965 and 1970, Abagnale was only free for a matter of months and that his records show he was in prison most of that time. On June 23, 2022, Leiva confronted Abagnale at the Connect IT Global 2022 conference in Las Vegas with prison and other public records in-hand. Leiva describes these events in his podcast series &quot;Pretend – The Real Catch Me If You Can (Part 1)&quot;.

===Relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation===
One of Abagnale&#x27;s most controversial claims is his relationship with the FBI. In 1977, when Abagnale began claiming a five-year uninterrupted life on the run, involving multiprofession imposter scams, he did not claim to work for the FBI. He did, however, leverage the names of FBI personnel to bolster his new biographical claims. In 1978, journalist Ira Perry determined that Abagnale and his publicist were giving out the names of FBI agents to any party that asked for references or verification of his claimed biography; in particular, they gave out the name of Robert Russ Franck, who they claimed was the &quot;former Atlanta agent&quot; who knew all about Abagnale. When Perry contacted Franck, who had just retired as head of the FBI&#x27;s Houston Division, and had never worked in Atlanta, Franck told him:

Franck informed Perry that he had only heard about Abagnale through people attempting to verify his biographical claims, and was unable to confirm whether the claims were true. Perry also interviewed Eugene Stewart, a retired FBI agent who was in charge of the Atlanta division when Abagnale claimed he was a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta. Stewart, who at this point was Delta Air Lines chief of security, informed Perry that Abagnale was a low-level criminal: &quot;It&#x27;s more of a harassment than anything else,&quot; said Stewart. In addition, Stewart noted that Abagnale had been using a Delta Air Lines uniform to cash bad personal checks in Texas after his 1974 parole. After his parole, Abagnale was arrested for theft from a children’s camp in Friendswood, Texas. Public records show that almost two years after his parole, in October 1975, Abagnale was hired by Aetna Insurance, and was abruptly fired by the company after he allegedly cashed bad personal checks during his employee training. Aetna eventually filed suit against Abagnale after his appearance on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; was broadcast in 1977.

After the publication of his 1980 autobiography, Abagnale began to inform his audiences that he was on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He carried this claim into the &#x27;90s: &quot;I was the only teenager in the history of the FBI to be put on their 10 Most Wanted list,&quot; Abagnale told his audiences in 1994. In the lead up to the release of the film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, this &quot;Ten Most Wanted Fugitives&quot; claim was used in marketing for the film. Pressed on this claim when the film was released, and with evidence clearly showing the absence of Abagnale on any most wanted list, he conceded on his website that he was never on the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted list.

In 2002, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Bob Baker (1948–2015) reported that no FBI task force was set up to capture Abagnale. Despite his claims that he was living in the infamous Riverbend Apartments, supposedly eluding the FBI for one year as a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta, the newspaper report of Abagnale&#x27;s arrest indicated he had been in the area for only two days; local FBI agents responded to a tip that Abagnale was in a local hotel and arrested him there. In September 2022, retired FBI Agent Alan Brown obtained permission from FBI headquarters to discuss his arrest of Abagnale. Brown spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva and acknowledged that the Atlanta field office simply acted on a teletype request to pick Abagnale up at the Squire Inn, in Marietta, Georgia. In contrast to Abagnale&#x27;s claims about escaping from the hotel, as depicted in the film, Brown stated that Abagnale was arrested in his room without incident. Brown also stated that he had no personal knowledge of Abagnale&#x27;s arrests prior to 1970, and after 1970, when Abagnale was arrested in Friendswood, Texas.

In the years following the release of &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot;, Abagnale began claiming that he was granted a unique parole from the federal prison in Petersburg, Virginia, so that he could work for the bureau: &quot;When the FBI took me out of prison, it was to do undercover work.&quot; Abagnale has claimed that the clandestine work was given to him directly by Clarence M. Kelley, who directed the FBI from 1973 to 1978. In his &quot;Talks at Google&quot; lecture, Abagnale claimed that because of his photographic memory, Kelley asked him to memorize the components of military hardware and infiltrate bases as a lieutenant. Abagnale describes Kelley&#x27;s instructions this way: &quot;Okay, you are a lieutenant in the army. You have been in the army this many years. Your expertise is this missile. I need you to learn all of this in two weeks, and I&#x27;m sending you to this base, and I want you to find out what&#x27;s going on in this particular area.&quot; In the lecture, Abagnale also claims Kelley sent him on similar missions &quot;as a scientist at a lab in New Mexico.&quot;

Jerri Williams, a retired FBI agent who specialized in white-collar crime and fraud, spoke to investigative journalist Javier Leiva about these claims. Williams rejected Abagnale&#x27;s claims of being tasked with clandestine operations directly by Kelley:

After the film was released, Abagnale began to use the first-person plural pronoun &quot;we&quot; to refer to the FBI; he also began to inform audiences that he was directly working for the FBI and celebrating each anniversary of his unique parole and the opportunity to go to work at the FBI; for example, in 2006, he informed his audiences, &quot;This year I am celebrating 31 years with the FBI,&quot; in 2014, he told his audiences, &quot;this year I&#x27;m celebrating 38 years at the FBI where I work today.&quot; The dates of this anniversary celebration point to 1976 and do not line up with Abagnale&#x27;s claim of a parole-release deal. Abagnale was, according to United States Board of Parole and Federal Bureau of Prisons standard practice at the time, sent to a pre-release center in Houston in 1973, within the 120 days prior to his actual federal parole date of February 8, 1974.

Ira Winkler, former intelligence analyst for the United States Department of Defense, and chief security architect for Walmart stores internationally, describes an encounter with Abagnale. Winkler queried Abagnale on the specifics of his position at the FBI. Abagnale responded that he was, &quot;a special agent&quot;. Winkler says, &quot;You mean a full-fledged special agent?&quot;, to which Abagnale responded in the affirmative.

In a 2018 interview broadcast on PBS, Abagnale publicly criticized former FBI director James Comey for his unprofessionalism during the 2016 US presidential election. In the same interview, Abagnale claims that the FBI is concerned that he is of retirement age: &quot;The FBI always ask me when am I going to retire, because they don&#x27;t want me to,&quot; said Abagnale. In interviews, Abagnale has claimed that his work with the FBI is &quot;pro bono&quot;, although he has claimed publicly that his company has made millions of dollars from contracts with the U.S. government: &quot;Today, Frank Abagnale and Associates does $10.5 million of business per year, 90% of it with the federal government,&quot; he told his audience in 1988. In 1991, Frank Abagnale and his wife Kelly filed for bankruptcy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the court filings, Abagnale claimed that he had $1.6 million in debts and $308,000 in assets.

Journalist Ira Perry was unable to find any evidence that Abagnale worked with the FBI; according to one retired FBI special agent in charge, Abagnale was caught trying to pass personal checks in 1978 several years after he claimed that he began working with the FBI. Dating back to the 1980s, Abagnale claimed that Joseph Shea, an FBI agent, had pursued him for five years (between 1965 and 1970). Abagnale claimed that Shea befriended and supervised him during his parole. When &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; was released in theatres, though, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that Abagnale and Shea only reunited in the late 1980s, almost 20 years after Shea arrested him. Abagnale spotted Shea at an anticrime seminar in Kansas City and sought out Shea to shake his hand.

When the film was released, an FBI spokesperson acknowledged that Abagnale had given lectures at the academy &quot;from time to time,&quot; but denied that Abagnale had been given commendations by the agency as claimed in the film&#x27;s marketing. At no point has the FBI made an official statement corroborating Abagnale&#x27;s biographical claims, nor has the agency confirmed his extraordinary claims that he was sent into a military base as an expert on missiles, and into a secret lab in New Mexico. Abagnale has claimed in public lectures that he was discussed in detail in a coffee-table book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. However, Abagnale&#x27;s name does not appear anywhere in the official book celebrating 100 years of the FBI. In his public lectures, Abagnale has taken on a pseudo-spokesperson role for the FBI. In discussing recruitments, he states, &quot;currently [2017] we take 1 in 10,000 applications.&quot; Abagnale made this same claim of 1 in 10,000 applications to &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; journalist Michael Katz in 2019. Overall approximately 11,500 applications per year are made for 900 positions at the FBI (2018 statistics), which is about one in 13 applicants.

In 2020, Abagnale was confronted by one of his victims in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When asked why he talks about being an attorney general and passing the state&#x27;s bar exam, and yet failing to acknowledge his arrest and conviction in Baton Rouge, Abagnale said, &quot;That&#x27;s because I work for the FBI.&quot; Abagnale claimed to the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; that he is an ethics instructor at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia: &quot;I teach ethics at the FBI academy, which is ironic, but years ago, someone at the bureau said, &#x27;Who better than you to do this?&#x27;—I try to teach young agents the importance of doing the right thing.&quot;

=== Talks at Google ===
In August 2022, Google disabled all comments and added a disclaimer to Abagnale&#x27;s &quot;Talks at Google&quot;, which now states: &quot;Disclaimer: Google does not endorse or condone the content contained within this video, nor does it lay claim to the validity of the actions described herein. The following is presented unaltered as it was recorded on Nov 27, 2017, and remains on the Talks at Google YouTube channel for historical purposes.&quot; In the video disclaimer Google did not provide an explicit reason for the abnegation of Abagnale&#x27;s video or whether or not it was part of their new initiative to work with journalists to combat misinformation and disinformation. However, according to investigative journalist Javier Leiva, the move was made in response to members of his audience.

=== Controversy at Xavier and other universities ===
On September 12, 2022, Frank Abagnale was awarded the &quot;Heroes in Ethics&quot; award by Xavier University, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Abagnale gave the keynote lecture at the university&#x27;s annual Heroes of Professional Ethics series. At the conclusion of his talk, Abagnale invited the audience to ask him any questions on any matter. A member of the audience, Jim Grinstead, the host of the podcast &quot;Scams and Cons&quot;, asked Abagnale, “So I wonder, in light of the ethics award you’re going to be presented tonight, would you come clean? Would you tell the truth about the stories you’ve told? Will you admit that you just lied to everybody, and you’re still conning them?” In his response Abagnale denied telling any lies or spreading any misinformation. He claimed he had nothing to do with his autobiography, the film, and the Broadway musical. Xavier University has removed any discussion of the September 12 event from its website.

The incident at Xavier University was not the first time Abagnale&#x27;s story caused controversy on a university campus. In 1981, after criminal-justice professor William Toney and his students debunked Abagnale&#x27;s biographical claims, several universities cancelled Abagnale&#x27;s appearances. In an attempt to provide compromise, the University of South Carolina asked Abagnale to sign an affidavit that would attest to the truthfulness of his biographical claims. The university informed Abagnale that he would still be allowed to give the speech and collect his speaking fee, even if he did not sign the affidavit, but if he refused, the university would warn the students at the outset of the speech that Abagnale had not promised to tell the truth. Abagnale refused to sign the affidavit, referring to the document as a &quot;slap in the face&quot;.

As skepticism of Abagnale&#x27;s story spread, he cancelled his own university bookings. In a letter to Georgia Southwestern State University, Abagnale wrote that it was wrong to profit from his criminal past by speaking about it to college campuses. Furthermore, in the letter to GSSU, Abagnale stated that he was cancelling all college speaking engagements because the criminal aspects of the life story he was presenting &quot;[are] not something to which young impressionable minds should be exposed.&quot; In the midst of this controversy, Abagnale was queried by journalist John Dagley, who asked him if his biography was a lie, to which he replied:

== Personal life ==
Abagnale and his wife Kelly live on Daniel Island, an island community which is part of Charleston, South Carolina. They have three sons, Scott, Chris, and Sean. Abagnale maintains that meeting his wife was the motivation for changing his life. He told author Paul Stenning that he met her while allegedly working undercover for the FBI when she was a cashier at a grocery store.

<doc id="225256" wikidata="Q412356" url="?curid=225256" title="Silicon carbide">
<text>Silicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum (), is a hard chemical compound containing silicon and carbon. A wide bandgap semiconductor, it occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite, but has been mass-produced as a powder and crystal since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite.

Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both.

== Natural occurrence ==

Naturally occurring moissanite is found in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite, corundum deposits, and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic.

Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan&#x27;s discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.

While rare on Earth, silicon carbide is remarkably common in space. It is a common form of stardust found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust have been found in pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating that these grains originated outside the solar system.

== History ==

=== Early experiments ===
Non-systematic, less-recognized and often unverified syntheses of silicon carbide include:
* César-Mansuète Despretz&#x27;s passing an electric current through a carbon rod embedded in sand (1849)
* Robert Sydney Marsden&#x27;s dissolution of silica in molten silver in a graphite crucible (1881)
* Paul Schuetzenberger&#x27;s heating of a mixture of silicon and silica in a graphite crucible (1881)
* Albert Colson&#x27;s heating of silicon under a stream of ethylene (1882).

=== Wide-scale production ===

Wide-scale production is credited to Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1891. Acheson was attempting to prepare artificial diamonds when he heated a mixture of clay (aluminium silicate) and powdered coke (carbon) in an iron bowl. He called the blue crystals that formed &quot;carborundum&quot;, believing it to be a new compound of carbon and aluminium, similar to corundum. Moissan also synthesized SiC by several routes, including dissolution of carbon in molten silicon, melting a mixture of calcium carbide and silica, and by reducing silica with carbon in an electric furnace.

Acheson patented the method for making silicon carbide powder on February 28, 1893. Acheson also developed the electric batch furnace by which SiC is still made today and formed the Carborundum Company to manufacture bulk SiC, initially for use as an abrasive. In 1900 the company settled with the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company when a judge&#x27;s decision gave &quot;priority broadly&quot; to its founders &quot;for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method&quot;.

The first use of SiC was as an abrasive. This was followed by electronic applications. In the beginning of the 20th century, silicon carbide was used as a detector in the first radios. In 1907 Henry Joseph Round produced the first LED by applying a voltage to a SiC crystal and observing yellow, green and orange emission at the cathode. The effect was later rediscovered by O.V. Losev in the Soviet Union, in 1923.

== Production ==

Because natural moissanite is extremely scarce, most silicon carbide is synthetic. Silicon carbide is used as an abrasive, as well as a semiconductor and diamond simulant of gem quality. The simplest process to manufacture silicon carbide is to combine silica sand and carbon in an Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace at a high temperature, between and . Fine SiO2 particles in plant material (e.g. rice husks) can be converted to SiC by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material. The silica fume, which is a byproduct of producing silicon metal and ferrosilicon alloys, can also be converted to SiC by heating with graphite at .

The material formed in the Acheson furnace varies in purity, according to its distance from the graphite resistor heat source. Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest purity and are found closest to the resistor. The color changes to blue and black at greater distance from the resistor, and these darker crystals are less pure. Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and they affect the electrical conductivity of SiC.

Pure silicon carbide can be made by the Lely process, in which SiC powder is sublimed into high-temperature species of silicon, carbon, silicon dicarbide (SiC2), and disilicon carbide (Si2C) in an argon gas ambient at 2,500 °C and redeposited into flake-like single crystals, sized up to 2 × 2 cm, at a slightly colder substrate. This process yields high-quality single crystals, mostly of 6H-SiC phase (because of high growth temperature).

A modified Lely process involving induction heating in graphite crucibles yields even larger single crystals of 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, having a section 81 times larger compared to the conventional Lely process.

Cubic SiC is usually grown by the more expensive process of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silane, hydrogen and nitrogen. Homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial SiC layers can be grown employing both gas and liquid phase approaches.

To form complexly shaped SiC, preceramic polymers can be used as precursors which form the ceramic product through pyrolysis at temperatures in the range 1,000–1,100 °C. Precursor materials to obtain silicon carbide in such a manner include polycarbosilanes, poly(methylsilyne) and polysilazanes. Silicon carbide materials obtained through the pyrolysis of preceramic polymers are known as polymer derived ceramics or PDCs. Pyrolysis of preceramic polymers is most often conducted under an inert atmosphere at relatively low temperatures. Relative to the CVD process, the pyrolysis method is advantageous because the polymer can be formed into various shapes prior to thermalization into the ceramic.

SiC can also be made into wafers by cutting a single crystal either using a diamond wire saw or by using a laser. SiC is a useful semiconductor used in power electronics.

== Structure and properties ==

Silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms. Through inert atmospheric pyrolysis of preceramic polymers, silicon carbide in a glassy amorphous form is also produced. The polymorphism of SiC is characterized by a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus, they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence.

Alpha silicon carbide (α-SiC) is the most commonly encountered polymorph, and is formed at temperatures greater than 1,700 °C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1,700 °C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.

Pure SiC is colorless. The brown to black color of the industrial product results from iron impurities. The rainbow-like luster of the crystals is due to the thin-film interference of a passivation layer of silicon dioxide that forms on the surface.

The high sublimation temperature of SiC (approximately 2,700 °C) makes it useful for bearings and furnace parts. Silicon carbide does not melt but begins to sublimate near 2,700 °C like graphite, having an appreciable vapor pressure near that temperature. It is also highly inert chemically, partly due to the formation of a thin passivated layer of SiO2. There is currently much interest in its use as a semiconductor material in electronics, where its high thermal conductivity, high electric field breakdown strength and high maximum current density make it more promising than silicon for high-powered devices. SiC has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion of about 2.3 × 10−6 K−1 near 300 K (for 4H and 6H SiC) and experiences no phase transitions in the temperature range 5 K to 340 K that would cause discontinuities in the thermal expansion coefficient.

=== Electrical conductivity ===
Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, which can be doped n-type by nitrogen or phosphorus and p-type by beryllium, boron, aluminium, or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, aluminium or nitrogen.

Superconductivity has been detected in 3C-SiC:Al, 3C-SiC:B and 6H-SiC:B at similar temperatures ~1.5 K. A crucial difference is however observed for the magnetic field behavior between aluminium and boron doping: 3C-SiC:Al is type-II. In contrast, 3C-SiC:B is type-I, as is 6H-SiC:B. Thus the superconducting properties seem to depend more on dopant (B vs. Al) than on polytype (3C- vs 6H-). In an attempt to explain this dependence, it was noted that B substitutes at C sites in SiC, but Al substitutes at Si sites. Therefore, Al and B &quot;see&quot; different environments, in both polytypes.

== Uses ==

=== Abrasive and cutting tools ===
In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. SiC provides a much sharper and harder alternative for sand blasting as compared to aluminium oxide. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.

In the arts, silicon carbide is a popular abrasive in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material.

In 1982 an exceptionally strong composite of aluminium oxide and silicon carbide whiskers was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite to a commercial product took only three years. In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and silicon carbide whisker-reinforced composite were introduced into the market.

=== Structural material ===
In the 1980s and 1990s, silicon carbide was studied in several research programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components were intended to replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.

Like other hard ceramics (namely alumina and boron carbide), silicon carbide is used in composite armor (e.g. Chobham armor), and in ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Dragon Skin, which was produced by Pinnacle Armor, used disks of silicon carbide. Improved fracture toughness in SiC armor can be facilitated through the phenomenon of abnormal grain growth or AGG. The growth of abnormally long silicon carbide grains may serve to impart a toughening effect through crack-wake bridging, similar to whisker reinforcement. Similar
AGG-toughening effects have been reported in Silicon nitride (Si3N4).

Silicon carbide is used as a support and shelving material in high temperature kilns such as for firing ceramics, glass fusing, or glass casting. SiC kiln shelves are considerably lighter and more durable than traditional alumina shelves.

In December 2015, infusion of silicon carbide nano-particles in molten magnesium was mentioned as a way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy suitable for use in aeronautics, aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.

=== Automobile parts ===
Silicon-infiltrated carbon-carbon composite is used for high performance &quot;ceramic&quot; brake discs, as they are able to withstand extreme temperatures. The silicon reacts with the graphite in the carbon-carbon composite to become carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC). These brake discs are used on some road-going sports cars, supercars, as well as other performance cars including the Porsche Carrera GT, the Bugatti Veyron, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, the McLaren P1, Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini and some specific high-performance Audi cars. Silicon carbide is also used in a sintered form for diesel particulate filters. It is also used as an oil additive to reduce friction, emissions, and harmonics.

==== Foundry crucibles ====
SiC is used in crucibles for holding melting metal in small and large foundry applications.

=== Electric systems ===
The earliest electrical application of SiC was as a surge protection in lightning arresters in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high resistance until the voltage across them reaches a certain threshold VT at which point their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below VT flushing current into the ground.

It was recognized early on that SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. The SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had to be placed in series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in lightning arresters. Gapped SiC arresters were used for lightning-protection and sold under the GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.

=== Electronic circuit elements ===
Silicon carbide was the first commercially important semiconductor material. A crystal radio &quot;carborundum&quot; (synthetic silicon carbide) detector diode was patented by Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody in 1906. It found much early use in shipboard receivers.

==== Power electronic devices ====
In 1993, the silicon carbide was considered a semiconductor in both research and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors were described.

A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance, though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance.
Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitriding has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems.

In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1,200 V were introduced to the market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. JFETs are now available rated 650 V to 1,700 V with resistance as low as 25 mΩ. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules.

SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.
Conferences such as the International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems (CIPS) report regularly about the technological progress of SiC power devices.
Major challenges for fully unleashing the capabilities of SiC power devices are:
* Gate drive: SiC devices often require gate drive voltage levels that are different from their silicon counterparts and may be even unsymmetric, for example, +20 V and −5 V.
* Packaging: SiC chips may have a higher power density than silicon power devices and are able to handle higher temperatures exceeding the silicon limit of 150 °C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to efficiently get the heat out of the devices and ensure a reliable interconnection.

Beginning with Tesla Model 3 the inverters in the drive unit use 24 pairs of silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET chips rated for 650 volts each. Silicon carbide in this instance gave Tesla a significant advantage over chips made of silicon in terms of size and weight. A number of automobile manufacturers are planning to incorporate silicon carbide into power electronic devices in their products. A significant increase in production of silicon carbide is projected, beginning with a large plant opened 2022 by Wolfspeed, in upstate New York.

==== LEDs ====
The phenomenon of electroluminescence was discovered in 1907 using silicon carbide and some of the first commercial LEDs were based on this material. When General Electric of America introduced its SSL-1 Solid State Lamp in March 1967, using a tiny chip of semi-conducting SiC to emit a point of yellow light, it was then the world&#x27;s brightest LED. By 1970 it had been usurped by brighter red LEDs, but yellow LEDs made from 3C-SiC continued to be manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and blue LEDs (6H-SiC) worldwide in the 1980s.

Carbide LED production soon stopped when a different material, gallium nitride, showed 10–100 times brighter emission. This difference in efficiency is due to the unfavorable indirect bandgap of SiC, whereas GaN has a direct bandgap which favors light emission. However, SiC is still one of the important LED components: It is a popular substrate for growing GaN devices, and it also serves as a heat spreader in high-power LEDs.

=== Astronomy ===
The low thermal expansion coefficient, high hardness, rigidity and thermal conductivity make silicon carbide a desirable mirror material for astronomical telescopes. The growth technology (chemical vapor deposition) has been scaled up to produce disks of polycrystalline silicon carbide up to in diameter, and several telescopes like the Herschel Space Telescope are already equipped with SiC optics, as well the Gaia space observatory spacecraft subsystems are mounted on a rigid silicon carbide frame, which provides a stable structure that will not expand or contract due to heat.

=== Thin-filament pyrometry ===

Silicon carbide fibers are used to measure gas temperatures in an optical technique called thin-filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close to that of the local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2,500 K can be measured.

=== Heating elements ===
References to silicon carbide heating elements exist from the early 20th century when they were produced by Acheson&#x27;s Carborundum Co. in the U.S. and EKL in Berlin. Silicon carbide offered increased operating temperatures compared with metallic heaters. Silicon carbide elements are used today in the melting of glass and non-ferrous metal, heat treatment of metals, float glass production, production of ceramics and electronics components, igniters in pilot lights for gas heaters, etc.

=== Heat shielding ===
The outer thermal protection layer of NASA&#x27;s LOFTID inflatable heat shield incorporates a woven ceramic made from silicon carbide, with fiber of such small diameter that it can be bundled and spun into a yarn.

=== Nuclear applications ===
Due to SiC&#x27;s exceptional neutron absorption capability, it is used as fuel cladding in nuclear reactors and as nuclear waste containment material. It is also used in producing radiation detectors for monitoring radiation levels in nuclear facilities, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. Again, SiC sensors and electronics for nuclear reactor applications are being developed potentially for future Martian nuclear power and the emerging terrestrial micro nuclear power plants.

==== Nuclear fuel particles and cladding ====
Silicon carbide is an important material in TRISO-coated fuel particles, the type of nuclear fuel found in high temperature gas cooled reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor. A layer of silicon carbide gives coated fuel particles structural support and is the main diffusion barrier to the release of fission products.

Silicon carbide composite material has been investigated for use as a replacement for Zircaloy cladding in light water reactors. One of the reasons for this investigation is that, Zircaloy experiences hydrogen embrittlement as a consequence of the corrosion reaction with water. This produces a reduction in fracture toughness with increasing volumetric fraction of radial hydrides. This phenomenon increases drastically with increasing temperature to the detriment of the material. Silicon carbide cladding does not experience this same mechanical degradation, but instead retains strength properties with increasing temperature. The composite consists of SiC fibers wrapped around a SiC inner layer and surrounded by an SiC outer layer. Problems have been reported with the ability to join the pieces of the SiC composite.

=== Jewelry ===
As a gemstone used in jewelry, silicon carbide is called &quot;synthetic moissanite&quot; or just &quot;moissanite&quot; after the mineral name. Moissanite is similar to diamond in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the Mohs scale, compared to 10 for diamond), with a refractive index between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common cubic zirconia. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly birefringent. For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the optic axis of the crystal to minimize birefringent effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm3 vs. 3.53 g/cm3), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher luster, sharper facets, and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into wax ring moulds for lost-wax casting, as can diamond, as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to . Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its birefringence and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.

=== Steel production ===

Silicon carbide, dissolved in a basic oxygen furnace used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It can also be used to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.

=== Catalyst support ===
The natural resistance to oxidation exhibited by silicon carbide, as well as the discovery of new ways to synthesize the cubic β-SiC form, with its larger surface area, has led to significant interest in its use as a heterogeneous catalyst support. This form has already been employed as a catalyst support for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, such as n-butane, to maleic anhydride.

=== Carborundum printmaking ===
Silicon carbide is used in carborundum printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit is applied in a paste to the surface of an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.

Carborundum grit is also used in stone Lithography. Its uniform particle size allows it to be used to &quot;Grain&quot; a stone which removes the previous image. In a similar process to sanding, coarser grit Carborundum is applied to the stone and worked with a Levigator, typically a round plate eccentric on a perpendicular shaft, then gradually finer and finer grit is applied until the stone is clean. This creates a grease sensitive surface.

=== Graphene production ===
Silicon carbide can be used in the production of graphene because of its chemical properties that promote the production of graphene on the surface of SiC nanostructures.

When it comes to its production, silicon is used primarily as a substrate to grow the graphene. But there are actually several methods that can be used to grow the graphene on the silicon carbide. The confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) growth method consists of a SiC chip that is heated under vacuum with graphite. Then the vacuum is released very gradually to control the growth of graphene. This method yields the highest quality graphene layers. But other methods have been reported to yield the same product as well.

Another way of growing graphene would be thermally decomposing SiC at a high temperature within a vacuum. But, this method turns out to yield graphene layers that contain smaller grains within the layers. So, there have been efforts to improve the quality and yield of graphene. One such method is to perform &quot;ex situ&quot; graphitization of silicon terminated SiC in an atmosphere consisting of argon. This method has proved to yield layers of graphene with larger domain sizes than the layer that would be attainable via other methods. This new method can be very viable to make higher quality graphene for a multitude of technological applications.

When it comes to understanding how or when to use these methods of graphene production, most of them mainly produce or grow this graphene on the SiC within a growth enabling environment. It is utilized most often at rather higher temperatures (such as 1,300 °C) because of SiC thermal properties. However, there have been certain procedures that have been performed and studied that could potentially yield methods that use lower temperatures to help manufacture graphene. More specifically this different approach to graphene growth has been observed to produce graphene within a temperature environment of around 750 °C. This method entails the combination of certain methods like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and surface segregation. And when it comes to the substrate, the procedure would consist of coating a SiC substrate with thin films of a transition metal. And after the rapid heat treating of this substance, the carbon atoms would then become more abundant at the surface interface of the transition metal film which would then yield graphene. And this process was found to yield graphene layers that were more continuous throughout the substrate surface.

=== Quantum physics ===
Silicon carbide can host point defects in the crystal lattice, which are known as color centers. These defects can produce single photons on demand and thus serve as a platform for single-photon source. Such a device is a fundamental resource for many emerging applications of quantum information science. If one pumps a color center via an external optical source or electric current, the color center will be brought to the excited state and then relax with the emission of one photon.

One well known point defect in silicon carbide is the divacancy which has a similar electronic structure as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. In 4H-SiC, the divacancy has four different configurations which correspond to four zero-phonon lines (ZPL). These ZPL values are written using the notation VSi-VC and the unit eV: hh(1.095), kk(1.096), kh(1.119), and hk(1.150).

=== Fishing rod guides ===
Silicon carbide is used in the manufacturing of fishing guides because of its durability and wear resistance. Silicon Carbide rings are fit into a guide frame, typically made from stainless steel or titanium which keep the line from touching the rod blank. The rings provide a low friction surface which improves casting distance while providing adequate hardness that prevents abrasion from braided fishing line.

=== Pottery glazes ===
Silicon carbide is used as a raw ingredient in some glazes applied to ceramics. At high temperatures it can reduce metal oxides forming silica and carbon dioxide. This can be used to make the glaze foam and crater due to the evolved carbon dioxide gas, or to reduce the colorant oxides and achieve colors such as copper reds otherwise only possible in a fuel powered reduction firing in an electric kiln.

<text>The naked-back knifefishes are a family (Gymnotidae) of knifefishes found only in fresh waters of Central America and South America. All have organs adapted to electroreception. The family has about 43 valid species in two genera.
These fish are nocturnal and mostly occur in quiet waters from deep rivers to swamps. In strongly flowing waters, they may bury themselves.

==Physical characteristics==
Like the other gymnotiforms, gymnotids have classic knifefish bodies. The body is long and eel-like, the dorsal fin and pelvic fins are absent, and the anal fin is extremely long and used for movement.

The sole member of &quot;Electrophorus&quot; is the electric eel, which produces both strong (up to 600 volts) and weak (&lt;1 V) electric discharges, for use in predation and communication/navigation, respectively. The electric eel is the largest of the gymnotiform fishes, growing up to more than length. Species of &quot;Gymnotus&quot; range from about in total length.

These knife fishes also use electricity to assist in their movement and navigation in the water due to their limited vision.

== Genera ==
According to FishBase, there are 43 species in two genera: 

* &quot;Electrophorus&quot; (3 species)
* &quot;Gymnotus&quot; (40 species)

Historically, &quot;Electrophorus&quot; was in a separate family Electrophoridae and ITIS continues to do this, but this is contradicted by available evidence and not followed by other authorities.

<doc id="225261" wikidata="Q356653" url="?curid=225261" title="Euler pseudoprime">
<text>In mathematics, an odd composite integer &quot;n&quot; is called an Euler pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime, and 

: formula_1

(where &quot;mod&quot; refers to the modulo operation).

The motivation for this definition is the fact that all prime numbers &quot;p&quot; satisfy the above equation which can be deduced from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. Fermat&#x27;s theorem asserts that if &quot;p&quot; is prime, and coprime to &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;). Suppose that &quot;p&quot;&gt;2 is prime, then &quot;p&quot; can be expressed as 2&quot;q&quot; + 1 where &quot;q&quot; is an integer. Thus, &quot;a&quot;(2&quot;q&quot;+1) − 1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;), which means that &quot;a&quot;2&quot;q&quot; − 1 ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;). This can be factored as (&quot;a&quot;&quot;q&quot; − 1)(&quot;a&quot;&quot;q&quot; + 1) ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;), which is equivalent to &quot;a&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1)/2 ≡ ±1 (mod &quot;p&quot;).

The equation can be tested rather quickly, which can be used for probabilistic primality testing. These tests are twice as strong as tests based on Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.

Every Euler pseudoprime is also a Fermat pseudoprime. It is not possible to produce a definite test of primality based on whether a number is an Euler pseudoprime because there exist &quot;absolute Euler pseudoprimes&quot;, numbers which are Euler pseudoprimes to every base relatively prime to themselves. The absolute Euler pseudoprimes are a subset of the absolute Fermat pseudoprimes, or Carmichael numbers, and the smallest absolute Euler pseudoprime is 1729 = 7×13×19 .

==Relation to Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes==

A slightly stronger test uses the Jacobi symbol to predict which of the two results will be found. The resultant Euler-Jacobi probable prime test verifies that
: formula_2
As with the basic Euler test, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are required to be comprime, but that test is included in the computation of the Jacobi symbol (&quot;a&quot;/&quot;n&quot;), whose value equals 0 if the values are &quot;not&quot; coprime. This slightly stronger test is called simply an Euler probable prime test by some authors. See, for example, page 115 of the book by Koblitz listed below, page 90 of the book by Riesel, or page 1003 of.

As an example of this test&#x27;s increased strength, 341 is an Euler pseudoprime to the base 2, but not an Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime. Even more significantly, there are no absolute Euler–Jacobi pseudoprimes.

A strong probable prime test is even stronger than the Euler-Jacobi test but takes the same computational effort. Because of this, prime-testing software is usually based on the strong test.

==Implementation in Lua==

 function EulerTest(k)
 a = 2
 if k == 1 then return false
 elseif k == 2 then return true
 else
 m = modPow(a,(k-1)/2,k)
 if (m == 1) or (m == k-1) then
 return true
 else
 return false
 end
 end
 end

<text>Nelson is a city located in the Selkirk Mountains on the West Arm of Kootenay Lake in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada. The city is known for its collection of restored heritage buildings that date back to a regional silver rush in 1886. Nelson is one of the three cities forming the commercial and population core of the West Kootenay region, the others being Castlegar and Trail. The city is the seat of the Regional District of Central Kootenay. It is represented in the provincial legislature by the riding of Nelson-Creston, and in the Parliament of Canada by the riding of Kootenay—Columbia.

==History==
===Founding===
The city of Nelson is situated in the western Kootenay region of British Columbia, which is part of the traditional territories of the Sinixt (or Lakes) and Ktunaxa (Kutenai) peoples.

Gold and silver were found in the area in 1867. Following the discovery of silver at nearby Toad Mountain in 1886, the town&#x27;s population quickly expanded, leading to incorporation in 1897. Two railways were built to pass through Nelson. Due to its location near transportation corridors, Nelson grew to supply the local mining activity and soon became the region&#x27;s transportation and distribution centre.

Nelson was named in 1888 after Hugh Nelson, then Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.

===Early 20th century===

Francis Rattenbury, an architect most noted in British Columbia for the Parliament Buildings in Victoria, the Vancouver Provincial Courthouse, and the second Hotel Vancouver, designed chateau-style civic buildings made of granite, which stand today. By the 1900s, Nelson boasted several fine hotels, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company store and an electric streetcar system. The local forestry and mining industries were well established.

The town built its own hydroelectric generating system. English immigrants planted lakeside orchards, and Doukhobors from Russia, sponsored by Tolstoy and the Quakers, tilled the valley benchlands. The Doukhobor museum is located nearby, close to the neighbouring town of Castlegar.

From 1917-1920 Nelson used Single Transferable Vote (STV), a form of proportional representation, to elect its councillors. Councillors were elected in one at-large district. Each voter casts just a single vote using a ranked transferable ballot.

During the Vietnam War, many American draft evaders settled in Nelson and the surrounding area. This influx of liberal and mostly educated young people significantly impacted the area&#x27;s cultural and political demographics.

Nelson&#x27;s mountainous geography kept growth confined to the narrow valley bottom, except for specific hillside structures such as the local High School and the former Notre Dame University College (NDU) campus. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when more prosperous cities were tearing down and rebuilding their downtowns to the design of the time, Nelson merchants &#x27;modernized&#x27; their buildings with aluminum siding.

===Baker Street===
In the early 1980s, Nelson suffered a devastating economic downturn when the local Kootenay Forest Products sawmill was closed. Downtown merchants were already suffering from the opening of a large, regional shopping centre on Nelson&#x27;s central waterfront, the Chahko Mika Mall. At the time, Victoria and Vancouver were experimenting with historical restorations of their oldest areas, with some success. To save downtown and Baker Street from blight, Nelson quickly followed suit, stripping aluminum facades and restoring the buildings to their original brilliance. Local designer Bob Inwood, one of Nelson&#x27;s many American immigrants, played a significant role as a consultant. By 1985, Baker Street was completely transformed. Affirmation of the street&#x27;s success came in 1986 when Steve Martin chose to produce his feature film &quot;Roxanne&quot; primarily in Nelson, using the local fire hall as a primary set and many historic locations for others. More broadly, the transformation marked the beginning of Nelson&#x27;s ongoing transition from a resource-based town to an arts and tourism town. A walk down Baker Street through the Historic District is now one of Nelson&#x27;s promoted visitor activities.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Nelson has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are warm and drier, with cool temperatures during the night. 
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Nelson had a population of 11,106 living in 4,948 of its 5,314 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 10,572. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Nelson&#x27;s poverty rate has been ascertained to be more than twice the provincial and national averages.

===Ethnicity===
===Religion===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Nelson included:
*Irreligion (7,415 persons or 69.1%)
*Christianity (2,675 persons or 24.9%)
*Buddhism (150 persons or 1.4%)
*Judaism (115 persons or 1.1%)
*Sikhism (70 persons or 0.7%)
*Hinduism (65 persons or 0.6%)
*Islam (20 persons or 0.2%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (10 persons or 0.1%)

==Economy==
Traditionally, the economy of Nelson and the surrounding area has been primarily resource-based (forestry, in particular). This sector still represents a component of the area’s employment. Nelson is also a provincial administrative center for the Kootenays, and several regional and district offices of the provincial government have been centralized in Nelson, as well as some Federal offices. Tourism has been of growing importance to the city.

Many craftspeople live in the Nelson region, and the city’s retail sector includes outlets where they can sell their creations.

In recent decades, Nelson and its region had been noted for illegal marijuana production, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; reporting in 2010 that:
Nelson has several retail outlets for natural foods, including a year-round market specializing in these products. A local news source claimed the Kootenay Country Co-op is &quot;the largest independent member-owned natural food store in Canada and a respected player nationally in organic retail circles.&quot; The Save-On-Foods in Nelson is that company&#x27;s leading store for organic and natural foods.

The Nelson Brewing Company is a microbrewery in Nelson.

==Arts and culture==
Nelson is noted as a cultural centre.

Nelson has benefited from art education opportunities for many decades. High-school-level art classes had always existed. Then, in 1957-58 an independent Nelson School of Art began to offer two-week programs in a provisional fashion. In 1960 NSA progressed to offering diploma programs in 1960; with an expanded program in 1961, its name was changed to Kootenay School of Art. It was recognized as British Columbia&#x27;s first art school. In 1969, the School&#x27;s studio training was relocated into the city&#x27;s Notre Dame University campus. In 1972, direct support from the province for its programs having ended, the School was steered into a &quot;trial&quot; merger with Selkirk College. In 1974 the School, at that point fully merged into Selkirk College, affiliated with Eastern Washington State College as well, to offer graduate internships.

Notre Dame University closed in 1977, and the Kootenay School of Art with it. It was succeeded in 1979 by offerings of the University of Victoria-sponsored David Thompson University Centre in buildings formerly accommodating Notre Dame. In 1991, an independent institution with an emphasis on fine crafts, Kootenay School of the Arts, was founded. In a few years, the School secured possession of a spacious stone heritage building. In 2006, remaining in its own building, the School was absorbed by the region&#x27;s Selkirk College as a department, renamed Kootenay Studio Arts. In addition, Selkirk College offers another respected department, its School of Music &amp; Media, in the former Notre Dame buildings.

The independent artists-run Oxygen Art Centre was developed by the Nelson Fine Art Centre Society (founded in 2002) by former writing and visual art faculty from the Kootenay School of the Arts. In 2005, the Society opened the Oxygen Art Centre in downtown Nelson, offering classes, exhibitions, and residencies. The Nelson Museum, Archives &amp; Gallery provides gallery space for travelling exhibitions, and work by some of the region&#x27;s artists.

==Attractions==
In 1998, Nelson was highlighted as the &quot;Number One Small Town Arts Community in Canada&quot; by the publisher of The 100 Best Small Arts Towns in America, and is home to a large and diverse artisan community.

The annual Artwalk, a display of artwork at various venues around town, features local talent where trippers and artwalkers (as the locals call them) can get an up close and personal look at the studios and creative processes of local artisans. July, August, and September mark three months of exhibitions throughout the downtown core in a variety of galleries and local businesses. Each month has a separate grand opening (usually the first Friday evening of the month), which includes refreshments, musicians, panhandlers, and artwork for locals and visitors to enjoy as they stroll through downtown Nelson. 

The Nelson Farmers Market located at Cottonwood Falls Park takes place every Saturday from May through October. The Downtown Farmers Market happens on Baker Street every Wednesday from June through September. Market Night, a lively nighttime street market in the heart of Nelson&#x27;s downtown, happens twice each summer. The markets all offer regional farm produce, delicious foods, and a variety of locally hand-crafted products.

Two local hiking trails are popular. The Pulpit Rock Trail offers a short but somewhat challenging hike that ends with a view of the city. After Pulpit Rock, the trail continues up the spine of Elephant Mountain (as the locals call it) to more postcard views and eventually to the radio towers visible everywhere in the city. Hikers venturing beyond Pulpit Rock should have essential wilderness gear and exercise common sense. Public access to the Pulpit Rock trail has been restored with the opening, in the spring of 2009, of a new access point several hundred metres west of the old trailhead, which was on private land. 

In the winter, skiing and snowboarding are Nelson&#x27;s primary outdoor activities. Thirty minutes south of town is the Whitewater Ski Resort, which provides access (via one triple chairlift, one double chairlift, one quad chairlift, and a handle tow) to of beginner to advanced terrain. The resort also provides access to hundreds of kilometres of off-piste skiing and back-country touring. In 2012, Nelson and Rossland, a small city southwest of Nelson, were jointly voted the best ski locales in North America by the readers of California-based &quot;Powder&quot; magazine.

Mountain biking is part of the local culture, and Nelson offers MTB-oriented trails for a variety of experience levels.

Rock climbing is also a popular summer activity. Kootenay Crag, Hall Siding, Grohman Narrows, and CIC Bluffs are popular city crags. Slocan Bluffs and Kinnaird are in nearby Slocan City and Castlegar. 2003 saw bouldering take off in Nelson, with extensive new development of bouldering areas in Grohman Narrows and nearby Robson.

Nelson is also located close to Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.

On January 13, 2007, Nelson was the broadcast location for the annual &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot; special.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Highways 3A and 6 pass through Nelson, while a scheduled commercial airline service is available at the West Kootenay Regional Airport in Castlegar, approximately southwest of the city. Trail Airport is another nearby airport, while Nelson Airport is several blocks away from downtown Nelson. Public transit in Nelson is provided by the West Kootenay Transit System, which runs several routes within the city and to neighbouring communities.

Both Level 2 and Level 3 (DC fast-charging) electric vehicle charging stations have been installed in the city. A carsharing service is available in the town through the Kootenay Carshare Co-operative.

Nelson is served by the freight-only Kootenay Valley Railway, an internal business unit of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Nelson is the historic headquarters of the CPR Kootenay Division, serving as the meeting point of the CPR Boundary subdivision running towards Castlegar, BC, and the CPR Nelson subdivision running towards Cranbrook.

==Education==
School District 8 Kootenay Lake operates public schools in Nelson and surrounding communities.

Schools include Nelson Christian Community School (NCCS, K-Gr.8) and St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School.

The &quot;Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique&quot; operates one French-language school: &quot;école des Sentiers-alpins&quot;.

Nelson is home to the Tenth Street and Silver King campuses of Selkirk College, which absorbed Kootenay School of the Arts as a department and was renamed Kootenay Studio Arts.

Kootenay Columbia College of Integrative Health Sciences has three campuses on Baker Street in Nelson.

==Media==
===Radio===
* CJLY-FM 93.5 (Kootenay Co-op Radio)
* CBYN-FM 98.7 (CBC Radio One; repeats CBTK-FM Kelowna)
* CHNV-FM 103.5 (&quot;The Bridge&quot;)
* CKKC-FM 106.9 (&quot;EZ Rock&quot;)

===Print===
The &quot;Nelson Daily News&quot; was a local newspaper that began publishing in 1902. In 2010, it was announced the paper would shut down following a final edition to be published on July 16, 2010. The closure occurred shortly after the &quot;Nelson Daily News&quot;&#x27; acquisition by Black Press, which purchased the paper from Glacier Media Inc.

Black Press owns the &quot;Nelson Star,&quot; which is now published weekly.

<doc id="225266" wikidata="Q117346" url="?curid=225266" title="Grigori Perelman">
<text>Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman (; born 13 June 1966) is a Russian mathematician and geometer who is known for his contributions to the fields of geometric analysis, Riemannian geometry, and geometric topology. In 2005, Perelman resigned from his research post in Steklov Institute of Mathematics and in 2006 stated that he had quit professional mathematics, owing to feeling disappointed over the ethical standards in the field. He lives in seclusion in Saint Petersburg and has declined requests for interviews since 2006.

In the 1990s, partly in collaboration with Yuri Burago, Mikhael Gromov, and Anton Petrunin, he made contributions to the study of Alexandrov spaces. In 1994, he proved the soul conjecture in Riemannian geometry, which had been an open problem for the previous 20 years. In 2002 and 2003, he developed new techniques in the analysis of Ricci flow, and proved the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, the former of which had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century. The full details of Perelman&#x27;s work were filled in and explained by various authors over the following several years.

In August 2006, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal for &quot;his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow&quot;, but he declined the award, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in money or fame; I don&#x27;t want to be on display like an animal in a zoo.&quot; On 22 December 2006, the scientific journal &quot;Science&quot; recognized Perelman&#x27;s proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific &quot;Breakthrough of the Year&quot;, the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.

On 18 March 2010, it was announced that he had met the criteria to receive the first Clay Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. On 1 July 2010, he rejected the prize of one million dollars, saying that he considered the decision of the board of the Clay Institute to be unfair, in that his contribution to solving the Poincaré conjecture was no greater than that of Richard S. Hamilton, the mathematician who pioneered the Ricci flow partly with the aim of attacking the conjecture. He had previously rejected the prestigious prize of the European Mathematical Society in 1996.

==Early life and education==
Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia) on June 13, 1966, to Jewish parents, Yakov (who now lives in Israel) and Lyubov (who still lives in Saint Petersburg with Perelman). Perelman&#x27;s mother Lyubov gave up graduate work in mathematics to raise him. Perelman&#x27;s mathematical talent became apparent at the age of 10, and his mother enrolled him in Sergei Rukshin&#x27;s after-school mathematics training program.

His mathematical education continued at the Leningrad Secondary School 239, a specialized school with advanced mathematics and physics programs. Perelman excelled in all subjects except physical education. In 1982, not long after his sixteenth birthday, he won a gold medal as a member of the Soviet team at the International Mathematical Olympiad hosted in Budapest, achieving a perfect score. He continued as a student of the School of Mathematics and Mechanics (the so-called &quot;матмех&quot; i.e. &quot;math-mech&quot;) at Leningrad State University, without admission examinations, and enrolled at the university.

After completing his PhD in 1990, Perelman began work at the Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where his advisors were Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Yuri Burago. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with a strong recommendation from the geometer Mikhail Gromov, Perelman obtained research positions at several universities in the United States. In 1991, Perelman won the Young Mathematician Prize of the Saint Petersburg Mathematical Society for his work on Aleksandrov&#x27;s spaces of curvature bounded from below. In 1992, he was invited to spend a semester each at the Courant Institute in New York University, where he began work on manifolds with lower bounds on Ricci curvature. From there, he accepted a two-year Miller Research Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. After proving the soul conjecture in 1994, he was offered jobs at several top universities in the US, including Princeton and Stanford, but he rejected them all and returned to the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg in the summer of 1995 for a research-only position.

==Early research==
===Convex geometry===
In his undergraduate studies, Perelman dealt with issues in the field of convex geometry. His first published article studied the combinatorial structures arising from intersections of convex polyhedra. With I. V. Polikanova, he established a measure-theoretic formulation of Helly&#x27;s theorem. In 1987, the year he began graduate studies, he published an article controlling the size of circumscribed cylinders by that of inscribed spheres.

===Negatively curved hypersurfaces===
Surfaces of negative curvature were the subject of Perelman&#x27;s graduate studies. His first result was on the possibility of prescribing the structure of negatively-curved polyhedral surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space. He proved that any such metric on the plane which is complete can be continuously immersed as a polyhedral surface. Later, he constructed an example of a smooth hypersurface of four-dimensional Euclidean space which is complete and has Gaussian curvature negative and bounded away from zero. Previous examples of such surfaces were known, but Perelman&#x27;s was the first to exhibit the saddle property on nonexistence of locally strictly supporting hyperplanes. As such, his construction provided further obstruction to the extension of a well-known theorem of Nikolai Efimov to higher dimensions.

===Alexandrov spaces===
Perelman&#x27;s first works to have a major impact on the mathematical literature were in the field of Alexandrov spaces, the concept of which dates back to the 1950s. In a very well-known paper coauthored with Yuri Burago and Mikhael Gromov, Perelman established the modern foundations of this field, with the notion of Gromov–Hausdorff convergence as an organizing principle. In a followup unpublished paper, Perelman proved his &quot;stability theorem,&quot; asserting that in the collection of all Alexandrov spaces with a fixed curvature bound, all elements of any sufficiently small metric ball around a compact space are mutually homeomorphic. Vitali Kapovitch, who described Perelman&#x27;s article as being &quot;very hard to read,&quot; later wrote a detailed version of Perelman&#x27;s proof, making use of some further simplifications.

Perelman developed a version of Morse theory on Alexandrov spaces. Despite the lack of smoothness in Alexandrov spaces, Perelman and Anton Petrunin were able to consider the gradient flow of certain functions, in unpublished work. They also introduced the notion of an &quot;extremal subset&quot; of Alexandrov spaces, and showed that the interiors of certain extremal subsets define a stratification of the space by topological manifolds. In further unpublished work, Perelman studied DC functions (difference of concave functions) on Alexandrov spaces and established that the set of regular points has the structure of a manifold modeled on DC functions.

For his work on Alexandrov spaces, Perelman was recognized with an invited lecture at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians.

===Comparison geometry===
In 1972, Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll established their important soul theorem. It asserts that every complete Riemannian metric of nonnegative sectional curvature has a compact nonnegatively curved submanifold, called a &quot;soul&quot;, whose normal bundle is diffeomorphic to the original space. From the perspective of homotopy theory, this says in particular that every complete Riemannian metric of nonnegative sectional curvature may be taken to be closed. Cheeger and Gromoll conjectured that if the curvature is strictly positive somewhere, then the soul can be taken to be a single point, and hence that the original space must be diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. In 1994, Perelman gave a short proof of Cheeger and Gromoll&#x27;s conjecture by establishing that, under the condition of nonnegative sectional curvature, Sharafutdinov&#x27;s retraction is a submersion. Perelman&#x27;s theorem is significant in establishing a topological obstruction to deforming a nonnegatively curved metric to one which is positively curved, even at a single point.

Some of Perelman&#x27;s work dealt with the construction of various interesting Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. He found Riemannian metrics on the connected sum of arbitrarily many complex projective planes with positive Ricci curvature, bounded diameter, and volume bounded away from zero. Also, he found an explicit complete metric on four-dimensional Euclidean space with positive Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, and such that the asymptotic cone is non-uniquely defined.

==Geometrization and Poincaré conjectures==
===The problems===

The Poincaré conjecture, proposed by mathematician Henri Poincaré in 1904, was throughout the 20th century regarded as a key problem in topology. On the 3-sphere, defined as the set of points at unit length from the origin in four-dimensional Euclidean space, any loop can be contracted into a point. Poincaré suggested that a converse might be true: if a closed three-dimensional manifold has the property that any loop can be contracted into a point, then it must be topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere. Stephen Smale proved a high-dimensional analogue of Poincaré&#x27;s conjecture in 1961, and Michael Freedman proved the four-dimensional version in 1982. Despite their work, the case of three-dimensional spaces remained completely unresolved. Moreover, Smale and Freedman&#x27;s methods have had no impact on the three-dimensional case, as their topological manipulations, moving &quot;problematic regions&quot; out of the way without interfering with other regions, seem to require high dimensions in order to work.

In 1982, William Thurston developed a novel viewpoint, making the Poincaré conjecture into a small special case of a hypothetical systematic structure theory of topology in three dimensions. His proposal, known as the Thurston geometrization conjecture, posited that given any closed three-dimensional manifold whatsoever, there is some collection of two-dimensional spheres and tori inside of the manifold which disconnect the space into separate pieces, each of which can be endowed with a uniform geometric structure. Thurston was able to prove his conjecture under some provisional assumptions. In John Morgan&#x27;s view, it was only with Thurston&#x27;s systematic viewpoint that most topologists came to believe that the Poincaré conjecture would be true.

At the same time that Thurston published his conjecture, Richard Hamilton introduced his theory of the Ricci flow. Hamilton&#x27;s Ricci flow is a prescription, defined by a partial differential equation formally analogous to the heat equation, for how to deform a Riemannian metric on a manifold. The heat equation, such as when applied in the sciences to physical phenomena such as temperature, models how concentrations of extreme temperatures will spread out until a uniform temperature is achieved throughout an object. In three seminal articles published in the 1980s, Hamilton proved that his equation achieved analogous phenomena, spreading extreme curvatures and uniformizing a Riemannian metric, in certain geometric settings. As a byproduct, he was able to prove some new and striking theorems in the field of Riemannian geometry.

Despite formal similarities, Hamilton&#x27;s equations are significantly more complex and nonlinear than the heat equation, and it is impossible that such uniformization is achieved without contextual assumptions. In completely general settings, it is inevitable that &quot;singularities&quot; occur, meaning that curvature accumulates to infinite levels after a finite amount of &quot;time&quot; has elapsed. Following Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s suggestion that a detailed understanding of these singularities could be topologically meaningful, and in particular that their locations might identify the spheres and tori in Thurston&#x27;s conjecture, Hamilton began a systematic analysis. Throughout the 1990s, he found a number of new technical results and methods, culminating in a 1997 publication constructing a &quot;Ricci flow with surgery&quot; for four-dimensional spaces. As an application of his construction, Hamilton was able to settle a four-dimensional curvature-based analogue of the Poincaré conjecture. Yau has identified this article as one of the most important in the field of geometric analysis, saying that with its publication it became clear that Ricci flow could be powerful enough to settle the Thurston conjecture. The key of Hamilton&#x27;s analysis was a quantitative understanding of how singularities occur in his four-dimensional setting; the most outstanding difficulty was the quantitative understanding of how singularities occur in three-dimensional settings. Although Hamilton was unable to resolve this issue, in 1999 he published work on Ricci flow in three dimensions, showing that if a three-dimensional version of his surgery techniques could be developed, and if a certain conjecture on the long-time behavior of Ricci flow could be established, then Thurston&#x27;s conjecture would be resolved. This became known as the Hamilton program.

===Perelman&#x27;s work===
In November 2002 and March 2003, Perelman posted two preprints to arXiv, in which he claimed to have outlined a proof of Thurston&#x27;s conjecture. In a third paper posted in July 2003, Perelman outlined an additional argument, sufficient for proving the Poincaré conjecture (but not the Thurston conjecture), the point being to avoid the most technical work in his second preprint.

Perelman&#x27;s first preprint contained two primary results, both to do with Ricci flow. The first, valid in any dimension, was based on a novel adaptation of Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s differential Harnack inequalities to the setting of Ricci flow. By carrying out the proof of the Bishop–Gromov inequality for the resulting Li−Yau length functional, Perelman established his celebrated &quot;noncollapsing theorem&quot; for Ricci flow, asserting that local control of the size of the curvature implies control of volumes. The significance of the noncollapsing theorem is that volume control is one of the preconditions of Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;compactness theorem&quot;. As a consequence, Hamilton&#x27;s compactness and the corresponding existence of subsequential limits could be applied somewhat freely.

The &quot;canonical neighborhoods theorem&quot; is the second main result of Perelman&#x27;s first preprint. In this theorem, Perelman achieved the quantitative understanding of singularities of three-dimensional Ricci flow which had eluded Hamilton. Roughly speaking, Perelman showed that on a microscopic level, every singularity looks either like a cylinder collapsing to its axis, or a sphere collapsing to its center. Perelman&#x27;s proof of his canonical neighborhoods theorem is a highly technical achievement, based upon extensive arguments by contradiction in which Hamilton&#x27;s compactness theorem (as facilitated by Perelman&#x27;s noncollapsing theorem) is applied to construct self-contradictory manifolds.

Other results in Perelman&#x27;s first preprint include the introduction of certain monotonic quantities and a &quot;pseudolocality theorem&quot; which relates curvature control and isoperimetry. However, despite being major results in the theory of Ricci flow, these results were not used in the rest of his work.

The first half of Perelman&#x27;s second preprint, in addition to fixing some incorrect statements and arguments from the first paper, used his canonical neighborhoods theorem to construct a Ricci flow with surgery in three dimensions, systematically excising singular regions as they develop. As an immediate corollary of his construction, Perelman resolved a major conjecture on the topological classification in three dimensions of closed manifolds which admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. His third preprint (or alternatively Colding and Minicozzi&#x27;s work) showed that on any space satisfying the assumptions of the Poincaré conjecture, the Ricci flow with surgery exists only for finite time, so that the infinite-time analysis of Ricci flow is irrelevant. The construction of Ricci flow with surgery has the Poincaré conjecture as a corollary.

In order to settle the Thurston conjecture, the second half of Perelman&#x27;s second preprint is devoted to an analysis of Ricci flows with surgery, which may exist for infinite time. Perelman was unable to resolve Hamilton&#x27;s 1999 conjecture on long-time behavior, which would make Thurston&#x27;s conjecture another corollary of the existence of Ricci flow with surgery. Nonetheless, Perelman was able to adapt Hamilton&#x27;s arguments to the precise conditions of his new Ricci flow with surgery. The end of Hamilton&#x27;s argument made use of Jeff Cheeger and Mikhael Gromov&#x27;s theorem characterizing collapsing manifolds. In Perelman&#x27;s adaptation, he required use of a new theorem characterizing manifolds in which collapsing is only assumed on a local level. In his preprint, he said the proof of his theorem would be established in another paper, but he did not then release any further details. Proofs were later published by Takashi Shioya and Takao Yamaguchi, John Morgan and Gang Tian, Jianguo Cao and Jian Ge, and Bruce Kleiner and John Lott.

===Verification===
Perelman&#x27;s preprints quickly gained the attention of the mathematical community, although they were widely seen as hard to understand since they had been written somewhat tersely. Against the usual style in academic mathematical publications, many technical details had been omitted. It was soon apparent that Perelman had made major contributions to the foundations of Ricci flow, although it was not immediately clear to the mathematical community that these contributions were sufficient to prove the geometrization conjecture or the Poincaré conjecture.

In April 2003, Perelman visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Stony Brook University, Columbia University, and New York University to give short series of lectures on his work, and to clarify some details for experts in the relevant fields. In the years afterwards, three detailed expositions appeared, discussed below. Since then, various parts of Perelman&#x27;s work have also appeared in a number of textbooks and expository articles.

* In June 2003, Bruce Kleiner and John Lott, both then of the University of Michigan, posted notes on Lott&#x27;s website which, section by section, filled in details of Perelman&#x27;s first preprint. In September 2004, their notes were updated to include Perelman&#x27;s second preprint. Following further revisions and corrections, they posted a version to arXiv on 25 May 2006, a modified version of which was published in the academic journal Geometry &amp; Topology in 2008. At the 2006 International Congress of Mathematicians, Lott said &quot;It has taken us some time to examine Perelman&#x27;s work. This is partly due to the originality of Perelman&#x27;s work and partly to the technical sophistication of his arguments. All indications are that his arguments are correct.&quot; In the introduction to their article, Kleiner and Lott explained:

:Since its 2008 publication, Kleiner and Lott&#x27;s article has subsequently been revised twice for corrections, such as for an incorrect statement of Hamilton&#x27;s important &quot;compactness theorem&quot; for Ricci flow. The latest revision to their article was in 2013.
* In June 2006, the Asian Journal of Mathematics published an article by Huai-Dong Cao of Lehigh University and Zhu Xiping of Sun Yat-sen University, giving a complete description of Perelman&#x27;s proof of the Poincaré and the geometrization conjectures. Unlike Kleiner and Lott&#x27;s article, which was structured as a collection of annotations to Perelman&#x27;s papers, Cao and Zhu&#x27;s article was aimed directly towards explaining the proofs of the Poincaré conjecture and geometrization conjecture. In their introduction, they explain:

:Based also upon the title &quot;A Complete Proof of the Poincaré and Geometrization Conjectures – Application of the Hamilton-Perelman Theory of Ricci Flow&quot; and the phrase &quot;This proof should be considered as the crowning achievement of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of Ricci flow&quot; from the abstract, some people interpreted Cao and Zhu to be taking credit from Perelman for themselves. When asked about the issue, Perelman said that he could not see any new contribution by Cao and Zhu and that they &quot;did not quite understand the argument and reworked it.&quot; Additionally, one of the pages of Cao and Zhu&#x27;s article was essentially identical to one from Kleiner and Lott&#x27;s 2003 posting. In a published erratum, Cao and Zhu attributed this to an oversight, saying that in 2003 they had taken down notes from the initial version of Kleiner and Lott&#x27;s notes, and in their 2006 writeup had not realized the proper source of the notes. They posted a revised version to ArXiv with revisions in their phrasing and in the relevant page of the proof.
* In July 2006, John Morgan of Columbia University and Gang Tian of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology posted a paper on arXiv in which they provided a detailed presentation of Perelman&#x27;s proof of the Poincaré conjecture. Unlike Kleiner-Lott and Cao-Zhu&#x27;s expositions, Morgan and Tian&#x27;s also deals with Perelman&#x27;s third paper. On 24 August 2006, Morgan delivered a lecture at the ICM in Madrid on the Poincaré conjecture, in which he declared that Perelman&#x27;s work had been &quot;thoroughly checked.&quot; In 2015, Abbas Bahri pointed out a counterexample to one of Morgan and Tian&#x27;s theorems, which was later fixed by Morgan and Tian and sourced to an incorrectly computed evolution equation. The error, introduced by Morgan and Tian, dealt with details not directly discussed in Perelman&#x27;s original work. In 2008, Morgan and Tian posted a paper which covered the details of the proof of the geometrization conjecture. Morgan and Tian&#x27;s two articles have been published in book form by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

==Fields Medal and Millennium Prize==
In May 2006, a committee of nine mathematicians voted to award Perelman a Fields Medal for his work on the Ricci flow. However, Perelman declined to accept the prize. Sir John Ball, president of the International Mathematical Union, approached Perelman in Saint Petersburg in June 2006 to persuade him to accept the prize. After 10 hours of attempted persuasion over two days, Ball gave up. Two weeks later, Perelman summed up the conversation as follows:

He was quoted as saying:

Nevertheless, on 22 August 2006, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal &quot;for his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow&quot;. He did not attend the ceremony and the presenter informed the congress that Perelman declined to accept the medal, which made him the only person to have ever declined the prize.

He has also rejected a prestigious prize from the European Mathematical Society.

On 18 March 2010, Perelman was awarded a Millennium Prize for solving the problem. On 8 June 2010, he did not attend a ceremony in his honor at the Institut Océanographique de Paris to accept his $1 million prize. According to Interfax, Perelman refused to accept the Millennium Prize in July 2010. He considered the decision of the Clay Institute unfair for not sharing the prize with Richard S. Hamilton, and stated that &quot;the main reason is my disagreement with the organized mathematical community. I don&#x27;t like their decisions, I consider them unjust.&quot;

The Clay Institute subsequently used Perelman&#x27;s prize money to fund the &quot;Poincaré Chair&quot;, a temporary position for young promising mathematicians at the Paris Institut Henri Poincaré.

==Possible withdrawal from mathematics==
Perelman quit his job at the Steklov Institute in December 2005. His friends are said to have stated that he currently finds mathematics a painful topic to discuss; by 2010, some even said that he had entirely abandoned mathematics.

Perelman is quoted in a 2006 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; saying that he was disappointed with the ethical standards of the field of mathematics. The article implies that Perelman refers particularly to alleged efforts of Fields medalist Shing-Tung Yau to downplay Perelman&#x27;s role in the proof and play up the work of Cao and Zhu. Perelman added:
This, combined with the possibility of being awarded a Fields Medal, led him to state that he had quit professional mathematics by 2006. He said:
It was unclear whether along with his resignation from Steklov and subsequent seclusion Perelman stopped his mathematics research. Yakov Eliashberg, another Russian mathematician, said that in 2007 Perelman confided to him that he was working on other things, but that it was too premature to discuss them. Perelman has shown interest in the Navier–Stokes equations and the problem of their solutions&#x27; existence and smoothness, according to &quot;Le Point&quot;.

In 2014, Russian media reported that Perelman was working in the field of nanotechnology in Sweden. Shortly thereafter, however, he was spotted again in his native hometown of Saint Petersburg. Russian media speculated that he periodically visits his sister in Sweden, while living in Saint Petersburg and taking care of his elderly mother.

==Perelman and the media==
Perelman has avoided journalists and other members of the media. Masha Gessen, author of a biography about Perelman, &quot;Perfect Rigour: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century&quot;, was unable to meet him.

A Russian documentary about Perelman in which his work is discussed by several leading mathematicians, including Mikhail Gromov, Ludwig Faddeev, Anatoly Vershik, Gang Tian, John Morgan and others, was released in 2011 under the title &quot;Иноходец. Урок Перельмана&quot; (&quot;Maverick: Perelman&#x27;s Lesson&quot;).

In April 2011, Aleksandr Zabrovsky, producer of &quot;President-Film&quot; studio, claimed to have held an interview with Perelman and agreed to shoot a film about him, under the tentative title &quot;The Formula of the Universe&quot;. Zabrovsky says that in the interview, Perelman explained why he rejected the one million dollar prize. A number of journalists believe that Zabrovsky&#x27;s interview is most likely a fake, pointing to contradictions in statements supposedly made by Perelman.

The writer Brett Forrest briefly interacted with Perelman in 2012. A reporter who had called him was told: &quot;You are disturbing me. I am picking mushrooms.&quot;

<doc id="225268" wikidata="Q201235" url="?curid=225268" title="Electrophorus electricus">
<text>Electrophorus electricus is the best-known species of electric eel. It is a South American electric fish. Until the discovery of two additional species in 2019, the genus was classified as the monotypic, with this species the only one in the genus. Despite the name, it is not an eel, but rather a knifefish. It is considered as a freshwater teleost which contains an electrogenic tissue that produces electric discharges.

==Taxonomic history==

The species has been reclassified several times. When originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, he used the name &quot;Gymnotus electricus&quot;, placing it in the same genus as &quot;Gymnotus carapo&quot; (banded knifefish) which he had described several years earlier. It was only about a century later, in 1864, that the electric eel was moved to its own genus &quot;Electrophorus&quot; by Theodore Gill.

In September 2019, David de Santana et al. suggested the division of the genus into three species based on DNA divergence, ecology and habitat, anatomy and physiology, and electrical ability: &quot;E. electricus&quot;, &quot;E. voltai&quot; sp. nov., and &quot;E. varii&quot; sp. nov. The study found &quot;E. electricus&quot; to be the sister species to &quot;E. voltai&quot;, with both species diverging during the Pliocene.

==Anatomy==
&quot;E. electricus&quot; has an elongated, cylindrical body, typically growing to about in length, and in weight, making them the largest of the Gymnotiformes. Their coloration is dark gray-brown on the back and yellow or orange on the belly. Mature females have a darker abdomen. They have no scales. The mouth is square and positioned at the end of the snout. The anal fin extends the length of the body to the tip of the tail. As in other ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The anterior chamber is connected to the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish&#x27;s buoyancy.

&quot;E. electricus&quot; has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity. As obligate air-breathers, &quot;E. electricus&quot; must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.

==Physiology==
&quot;E. electricus&quot; has three pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity: the main organ, Hunter&#x27;s organ, and Sachs&#x27; organ. These organs occupy a large part of its body, and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of electric organ discharges: low voltage and high voltage. These organs are made of electrocytes, lined up so a current of ions can flow through them and stacked so each one adds to a potential difference. The three electrical organs are developed from muscle and exhibit several biochemical properties and morphological features of the muscle sarcolemma; they are found symmetrically along both sides of the eel.

When the eel finds its prey, the brain sends a signal through the nervous system to the electrocytes. This opens the ion channels, allowing sodium to flow through, reversing the polarity momentarily. By causing a sudden difference in electric potential, it generates an electric current in a manner similar to a battery, in which stacked plates each produce an electric potential difference. Electric eels are also capable of controlling their prey&#x27;s nervous systems with their electrical abilities; by controlling their victim&#x27;s nervous system and muscles via electrical pulses, they can keep prey from escaping or force it to move so they can locate its position.

Electric eels use electricity in multiple ways. Low voltages are used to sense the surrounding environment. High voltages are used to detect prey and, separately, stun them, at which point the electric eel applies a suction-feeding bite.

Sachs&#x27; organ is associated with electrolocation. Inside the organ are many muscle-like cells, called electrocytes. Each cell produces 0.15 V, the cells being stacked in series to enable the organ to generate nearly 10 V at around 25 Hz in frequency. These signals are emitted by the main organ; Hunter&#x27;s organ can emit signals at rates of several hundred hertz.

There are several physiological differences among the three electric organs, which allow them to have very different functions. The main electrical organ and the strong-voltage section of Hunter&#x27;s organ are rich in calmodulin, a protein that is involved in high-voltage production. Additionally, the three organs have varying amounts of Na+/K+-ATPase, which is a Na+/K+ ion pump that is crucial in the formation of voltage. The main and Hunter&#x27;s organs have a high expression of this protein, giving it a high sensitivity to changes in ion concentration, whereas Sachs&#x27; organ has a low expression of this protein.

The typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal. The eels can vary the intensity of the electric discharge, using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves. They can also concentrate the discharge by curling up and making contact at two points along its body. When agitated, they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at least an hour without tiring.

&quot;E. electricus&quot; also possesses high frequency–sensitive tuberous receptors, which are distributed in patches over its body. This feature is apparently useful for hunting other Gymnotiformes. &quot;E. electricus&quot; has been prominent in the study of bioelectricity since the 18th century. The species is of some interest to researchers, who make use of its acetylcholinesterase and adenosine triphosphate.

Despite being the first described species in the genus and thus the most famous example, &quot;E. electricus&quot; actually has the weakest maximum voltage of the three species in the genus, at only 480 volts (as opposed to 572 volts in &quot;E. varii&quot; and 860 volts in &quot;E. voltai&quot;).

==Ecology and life history==
===Habitat===

&quot;E. electricus&quot; is restricted to freshwater habitats in the Guiana Shield. Populations in the Amazon basin, Brazilian Shield, and other parts of the Guiana Shield are now thought to belong to &quot;E. varii&quot; and &quot;E. voltai&quot;.

===Feeding ecology===
&quot;E. electricus&quot; feeds on invertebrates, although adult eels may also consume fish and small mammals, such as rats. First-born hatchlings eat other eggs and embryos from later clutches. The juveniles eat invertebrates, such as shrimp and crabs.

===Reproduction===

&quot;E. electricus&quot; is known for its unusual breeding behavior. In the dry season, a male eel makes a nest from his saliva into which the female lays her eggs. As many as 3,000 young hatch from the eggs in one nest. Males grow to be larger than females by about .

<text>In electromagnetism, an electrophorus or electrophore is a simple, manual, capacitive, electrostatic generator used to produce charge via the process of electrostatic induction. A first version of it was invented in 1762 by Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke. Italian scientist Alessandro Volta improved and popularized the device in 1775, and is sometimes erroneously credited with its invention. The word &quot;electrophorus&quot; was coined by Volta from the Greek , and , meaning &#x27;electricity bearer&#x27;.

==Description and operation==

The electrophorus consists of a dielectric plate (originally a &#x27;cake&#x27; of resinous material such as pitch or wax, but in modern versions plastic is used) and a metal plate with an insulating handle. The dielectric plate is first charged through the triboelectric effect by rubbing it with fur or cloth. For this discussion, imagine the dielectric gains negative charge by rubbing, as in the illustration below. The metal plate is then placed onto the dielectric plate. The dielectric does not transfer a significant fraction of its surface charge to the metal because the microscopic contact is poor. Instead the electrostatic field of the charged dielectric causes the charges in the metal plate to separate. It develops two regions of charge – the positive charges in the plate are attracted to the side facing down toward the dielectric, charging it positively, while the negative charges are repelled to the side facing up, charging it negatively, with the plate remaining electrically neutral as a whole. Then, the side facing up is momentarily grounded (which can be done by touching it with a finger), draining off the negative charge. Finally, the metal plate, now carrying only one sign of charge (positive in our example), is lifted.

Since the charge on the dielectric is not depleted in this process, the charge on the metal plate can be used for experiments, for example by touching it to metal conductors allowing the charge to drain away, and the uncharged metal plate can be placed back on the dielectric and the process repeated to get another charge. This can be repeated as often as desired, so in principle an unlimited amount of induced charge can be obtained from a single charge on the dielectric. For this reason Volta called it &quot;elettroforo perpetuo&quot; (the perpetual electricity bearer). In actual use the charge on the dielectric will eventually (within a few days at most) leak through the surface of the cake or the atmosphere to recombine with opposite charges around to restore neutrality.

One of the largest examples of an electrophorus was built in 1777 by German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. It was 6 feet (2 m) in diameter, with the metal plate raised and lowered using a pulley system. It could reportedly produce 15-inch (38 cm) sparks. Lichtenberg used its discharges to create the strange treelike marks known as Lichtenberg figures.

==The source of the charge==

Charge in the universe is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the metal plate (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the metal plate). This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged metal plate away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential energy in the form of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the metal plate actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectric plate.

The electrophorus is thus actually a manually operated electrostatic generator, using the same principle of electrostatic induction as electrostatic machines such as the Wimshurst machine and the Van de Graaff generator.

<text>Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1994 by singer and keyboardist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody in Little Rock, Arkansas. After releasing independent EPs as a duo in the late &#x27;90s and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, &quot;Fallen&quot;, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Fallen&quot; sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering Evanescence two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. They released their first live album and concert DVD, &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.

Evanescence released their second studio album, &quot;The Open Door&quot;, in 2006, co-composed by Lee and guitarist Terry Balsamo. It received a Grammy nomination and has sold more than six million copies worldwide. With Balsamo, guitarist Troy McLawhorn, bassist Tim McCord and drummer Will Hunt, the band reconvened in 2009 to work on music for their next album, &quot;Evanescence&quot;. Released in 2011, it marked the first album co-written as a band. It debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums charts. Following the end of the album&#x27;s tour cycle, the band entered a hiatus.

In 2014, Lee and Evanescence left their record label and became an independent band. The band emerged from hiatus in 2015 and resumed touring, while a new album was not yet created as Lee was also focusing on a solo project. In 2016, Lee stated that Evanescence was working on a fourth album, &quot;Synthesis&quot; (2017), composed of orchestral and electronica arrangements of their previous material alongside two new songs. Its release was followed by the Synthesis Live tour, in which the band performed with live orchestras for the first time. After pandemic delays, Evanescence released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Bitter Truth&quot;, in 2021, which reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent, Alternative, and Hard Rock charts.

Generally classified as a gothic alternative metal and hard rock band, Evanescence have a diverse sound incorporating various musical styles including classical music, alternative music, heavy metal, industrial music, and electronic music, driven by Lee&#x27;s contrasting musical pursuits and introspective songwriting. Beginning as a duo partnership, Evanescence had several lineup changes, and became a band collaboration in 2009. The band comprises Lee, guitarist Tim McCord since 2006, guitarist Troy McLawhorn and drummer Will Hunt since 2007, and bassist Emma Anzai since 2022. Among other accolades, Evanescence has received two Grammy Awards, three &quot;Loudwire&quot; Music Awards, a &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Award, a &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Music Award, a &quot;Rock Sound&quot; award, a Brit Award nomination, three American Music Award nominations, and five MTV Video Music Award nominations. Evanescence have sold a total of 31.9 million albums, making the band one of the best selling hard rock and metal artists of all time.

==History==
===1994–2000: Formation and early years===
Singer and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody met in 1994 in Little Rock, Arkansas at age 13 and 14, when the two were at a Christian youth camp where Lee played piano during sport activities and Moody played acoustic guitar and she thought they could play music together. Lee thinks what drew them together at the time was that they &quot;didn&#x27;t fit in that well&quot; and were &quot;out of [their] element in this silly camp environment&quot;. Within a month of meeting, Lee brought Moody a cassette tape of her playing guitar and singing a song she wrote. They became musical collaborators, playing and working on music at Lee&#x27;s home, and were soon performing acoustic sets at book stores and coffee houses in the Little Rock area. Lee said their music at the time &quot;sounded different because we didn&#x27;t have the means to make it sound like we wanted&quot;. Strings, choirs, and &quot;dramatic, cinematic&quot; sounds were musical desires they couldn&#x27;t materialize as they were &quot;just two kids in a basement&quot;. Lee had a 16-track recorder and she and Moody would use it and Pro Tools, &quot;fake strings and choirs&quot; on her keyboard, and layer sounds and beats for their early material, which they mixed and produced. &quot;We were basically just putting it down to remember what we wanted&quot;, Lee said.

Lee had the musical vision for Evanescence. What made her want to start a band was &quot;the idea of combinations that were unlikely&quot;. Danny Elfman&#x27;s film scores were a significant influence for her when she began creating Evanescence&#x27;s music. Lee aimed to combine her various musical tastes, &quot;bringing something from the cinematic and classical symphonic world and marrying it to metal, hard rock and alternative music.&quot; Perceiving &quot;similarities between the drama of classical music and the heavier stuff I was listening to&quot; inspired her to &quot;bring those things together for myself&quot;, and she infused in Evanescence her love of contrasting sounds. &quot;There was all this music that was inspiring me. And Evanescence was the product of these two extremes combining&quot;. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, Lee and Moody decided on Evanescence, which means disappearance or fading away. They wanted a name that was &quot;out of nowhere&quot;, and when they came across the word they found it &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;elusive&quot;.

Lee and Moody recorded two EPs as Evanescence: &quot;Evanescence&quot; (1998), of which 100 copies were made and sold at their early live performances; and &quot;Sound Asleep&quot; (1999), also known as the &quot;Whisper&quot; EP. Their demos got them airplay on the local modern rock station in Little Rock, which helped them develop a local fanbase, allowing them to play a couple of bigger shows a year and hire other musicians to perform other instruments live. Although they played with guest musicians, Evanescence remained a duo. &quot;It was more because that&#x27;s what we did and how we worked rather than not wanting any other input&quot;, Lee recalled; &quot;the idea of a full band playing these songs was something that only came along later.&quot; Since Evanescence&#x27;s start, the two had brought in several people to record or play live, but their vision was never shared by others &quot;so it always ended reverting back to the two of us&quot;. Lee and Moody were focused on writing music over playing live shows, and they did not want to have a band join their writing process, Moody noted; &quot;we just wanted it to be the two of us and so we&#x27;d play once or twice a year.&quot; He said that they would be &quot;off writing and recording in our closets for six months&quot;, and as they couldn&#x27;t have live shows with just a duo, they would book a gig and ask friends to perform with them. Moody stated that he did not remember how many EPs they released, and he viewed them as &quot;really just a means&quot;; CDs &quot;we could sell ourselves at our shows so we could go out and buy pizza. They really weren&#x27;t official releases&quot;.

In 2000, they self-released a demo CD called &quot;Origin&quot;, which they sold at local shows, and packaged to shop it to record labels. Lee and Moody stated that the CD was not an official release, but a compilation of their demos. &quot;Origin&quot; and their earlier EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs that would later appear on their debut album. Moody expressed dissatisfaction with their pre-&quot;Fallen&quot; material, stating in an interview, &quot;What we had in our head was &quot;Fallen&quot;, although it was a long time ago and we didn&#x27;t have the technology, so a lot of our early recordings were just shit.&quot; In a February 2003 radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download their demos from the Internet, rather than purchase them from online sources such as eBay where it had been selling for US$400.

===2001–2004: &quot;Fallen&quot; and &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;===

Evanescence were having their demos mastered at Ardent Studios in Memphis, where a producer heard it and played the demos to his friend at Wind-up Records, head of A&amp;R Diana Meltzer. Meltzer said what made her want to sign them was Lee&#x27;s voice, lyrics and their gothic sound. When she heard &quot;My Immortal&quot; she said she &quot;knew it was a hit&quot;. Evanescence was signed by Wind-up in 2001. The label flew them to New York, and told them that they loved their different sound and thought they had potential, but &quot;we don&#x27;t really totally know what to do with you&quot;, Lee recalled. They were then told, &quot;if you were this good while distracted by school and all this other stuff, how good will you be if we put you in an environment where you have nothing to do but write and be influenced by your surroundings, like in Los Angeles.&quot; They were relocated to Los Angeles, given an apartment and rehearsal space and enrolled in a gym, according to Meltzer, and Lee, who was very introverted, received help from an acting teacher to overcome her stage fright. Meltzer told HitQuarters in 2003 that, while she loved Lee&#x27;s voice, their gothic sound, and Lee and Moody had already exhibited &quot;huge talent&quot; with their prior demo material, they were still young and she felt they could benefit from more time to work on their debut album so they &quot;could deliver a breakthrough sound&quot;.

Lee said that at the time of signing, they did not realize the label would move them out to Los Angeles for two years, thinking it would be about six months. The length of time in Los Angeles &quot;really frustrated&quot; them. The label was apprehensive about the marketability of a female-led band, and advised them to just keep writing songs. It ended up being a fruitful writing experience in Los Angeles, Lee said, as they wrote half of the album there and were able to make use of other equipment to get sounds they wanted. After almost two years of Evanescence working on the album, Dave Fortman was brought in to produce it. Then, label executives refused to release the album unless Lee and Moody agreed to hire a full-time male co-vocalist. When they did not agree, the label said they were withdrawing their funding and releasing them from their contract. They left Los Angeles and drove back to Little Rock.

A few weeks later, the label relented, informing them that they would release their album if they agreed to have a male rapper on its lead single, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, in order to give something familiar to listeners. Lee was not happy about this, but reluctantly agreed to the compromise and wrote the part for the male vocal. She originally wanted the lead single to be &quot;Going Under&quot; as she was concerned that the public would hear &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; with its male vocal and decide that was the sound of the band. She was relieved that people were still receptive to Evanescence when &quot;Going Under&quot; was released as their second single. Lee prefers &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; without the label-forced rap, and expressed dissatisfaction that it &quot;stamps a time period&quot; on the song; however, she made peace with it because they were able to &quot;survive past it&quot; and &quot;people were able to, for the most part, understand who we are without us getting stuck in that place.&quot;

&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, featuring guest vocals from Paul McCoy of 12 Stones, and &quot;My Immortal&quot; were originally featured on of the 2003 action film &quot;Daredevil&quot;, released in February 2003. Evanescence&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; was released by Wind-up on March 4, 2003. As with their pre-&quot;Fallen&quot; work, Lee and Moody were the main writers of the album, with Lee being the core writer. Most of Lee&#x27;s writing on &quot;Fallen&quot; was inspired by an abusive relationship she was in. Lee and Moody said they did not consider their music to be &quot;goth&quot;, with Moody adding that he thinks the &quot;goth&quot; label came because the songs sound sad and people think that &quot;sad equals dark equals Goth. It&#x27;s real easy for them to throw us in that box&quot;. Moody also disliked the nu metal label, stating: &quot;I think the only nu-metal thing about us is the fact that on one song we have rap and singing&quot;. Lee also disagreed with the nu metal tag, attributing it to the rap rock of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;. After the album&#x27;s completion, the touring lineup was hired: guitarist John LeCompt, drummer Rocky Gray, and bassist Will Boyd, the first two old friends of Moody.

Evanescence&#x27;s music was initially promoted by their label in the Christian market, and Lee and Moody publicly made it clear in an April 2003 interview that they were not a Christian band or Christian rock. Moody&#x27;s comments against being in the Christian market immediately prompted the label&#x27;s chairman Alan Meltzer to send a letter to Christian radio and retail outlets explaining that despite the &quot;spiritual underpinning that ignited interest and excitement in the Christian religious community&quot;, Evanescence were &quot;a secular band, and as such view their music as entertainment&quot; and the label then &quot;strongly feels that they no longer belong in Christian retail outlets&quot;. Wind-up formally requested the recall of &quot;Fallen&quot; from Christian retailers and radio stations. After receiving the letter, many Christian radio stations pulled &quot;Fallen&quot; songs from their playlists.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated in April 2003 that while Wind-up had no official Christian affiliation, they had been marketing their bands &quot;to both the Christian and mainstream music market&quot;. Wind-Up &quot;began courting the Christian music market more than a year ago, making its first foray with 12 Stones&#x27; self-titled 2002 debut. Hooking up with powerhouse Christian music distributor Provident ... Wind-Up attempted to tap into a segment that generated sales of more than 50 million albums in 2002&quot;. The CEO of Provident, Terry Hemmings, said that the decision to recall Evanescence&#x27;s album likely would not hurt Wind-up&#x27;s image in the Christian market, and that he was puzzled by the band&#x27;s about-face, saying: &quot;They clearly understood the album would be sold in these channels.&quot; Meltzer claimed their decision to promote Evanescence in the Christian market was made with the band&#x27;s consent. Lee said that she had always opposed the promotion in the Christian market and the &quot;Christian band&quot; identification from the beginning, while Moody had supported it. Moody had misrepresented Evanescence in the past, talking about his religious beliefs as Evanescence&#x27;s. The label wanted to use the Christian market promotion as a marketing tool for the band, which she had opposed, stating that &quot;it was an important fight to me because it felt false. That wasn&#x27;t really what our music was. And I felt like they were selling somebody something that wasn&#x27;t true.&quot; She noted that Evanescence &quot;has never been a Christian band&quot; and lyrically never had a religious affiliation.
On April 7, 2003, Wind-Up released &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single. Wind-up president Ed Vetri revealed that when the label had introduced the song to radio, radio programmers rejected it, saying, &quot;A chick and a piano? Are you kidding? On rock radio?&quot; Some program directors would hear the female voice and piano at the start of the song and turn it off without listening to the rest of the song. A female voice on rock radio was a rarity, and the song was considered for airplay only after there was a male vocal on it. After the song was released on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack, a grassroots fanbase grew and listeners began requesting air play for it, compelling radio stations to reconsider the band. The song became a global hit for Evanescence and reached number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 6, 2003. It topped the UK singles chart, where it peaked for four weeks from June–July 2003. On the worldwide success of the song, Lee said: 

Evanescence performed on radio shows and on the festival circuit for weeks in early 2003. They embarked on their first headlining tour from April to May in the US. In June 2003, they had to cancel shows in Germany due to Moody reportedly falling ill. That month, Evanescence accepted an offer from the video game company Nintendo to perform on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, which they headlined beginning on August 4, 2003. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Going Under&quot; was released on August 18, 2003. It peaked at number five on the US Modern Rock Tracks, 24 on the Active Rock chart, and number eight on the UK singles chart. Lee recalled the rapid success after the album was released, with concerts going from club shows to arenas in two months. In an August 2003 interview, Moody said that Evanescence is &quot;just Amy and I, and I want to keep it that way&quot;, adding that their process together is what works. In another interview with &quot;Rock Sound&quot;, he said that he would like tour drummer Rocky Gray to play on the next album but did not need the other tour players, LeCompt and Boyd.

On October 22, 2003, Moody left the band during the European tour for &quot;Fallen&quot;, reportedly because of creative differences. Moody had called their management and informed them he was quitting. Lee got a call from their manager asking her to &quot;beg [Moody] to stay&quot;, to which she said &quot;that&#x27;s exactly what he wants me to do&quot; and expressed that if Moody was going to leave, the band &quot;would appreciate it if he&#x27;d wait until the end of the tour. But if he can&#x27;t, then go ahead and go.&quot; With his impromptu exit in the middle of tour, Lee improvised and had them play as a foursome to not cancel a show. In an interview, Lee said, &quot;we&#x27;d gotten to a point that if something didn&#x27;t change, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to make a second record.&quot; She said that by that point Moody &quot;hated the band, he hated being on tour and his negativity made everyone around him miserable. He was trying to pull the whole ship down with him&quot; and she would not let that happen. His exit was a relief because of tensions created within the band, which was at a &quot;breaking point&quot;. &quot;It was a really uncomfortable situation for everybody ... completely unstable and unhappy&quot;, she explained. &quot;It was a scary time before he left because I knew something was going to happen and I didn&#x27;t know what and I was afraid everything we worked for had the potential of going down the toilet.&quot;

In Lee&#x27;s termination letter to their manager, she stated that Moody was physically and verbally abusive to her. With Moody gone, &quot;we felt like a weight had been lifted&quot;, she said. Touring guitarist John LeCompt said in a 2006 interview that Lee &quot;gained authority as soon as Ben Moody walked out the door. They had an equal partnership, but he was the man, he had to strangle the band, all the life out of it&quot;. Lee said that she and Moody had not been friends since their teenage years, and they had pretended to be friends after &quot;Fallen&quot;″s release when they were really only business partners. In 2004, Lee confirmed that there were complications for months following Moody&#x27;s departure &quot;with the legalities of everything – whether we would be legally allowed to continue under the same name&quot;. &quot;A lot of things were held up internally that I wasn&#x27;t allowed to talk about, and I was worried, because it was very important to me to be able to stand up and say, &#x27;No. One person leaving in the middle of a tour and trying to hurt us isn&#x27;t going to make us lose the entire band.&#x27;&quot; In a 2006 interview, she stated that when Moody was in the band, &quot;a lot of decisions had been made over my head, or around me, or for me, that I wouldn&#x27;t have made for myself&quot;.

Lee said that she and Moody had never sat down and wrote together, and instead would combine their respective parts in songs. From the start, Lee would only write music by herself, considering it a vulnerable process and feeling disrespected by Moody and unsafe around him. The creation of &quot;Fallen&quot; largely consisted of her and Moody writing music separately and then adding to each other&#x27;s work, due to tension and significant creative differences between them. Lee&#x27;s creative disagreements with Moody included his strict approach to songwriting and focus on commerciality; he would &quot;always be corralling&quot; her ideas, and wanting to push them in a more commercial, pop direction. She said his influences were &quot;a lot different&quot; from hers. &quot;It was always a push and pull between us, for me&quot;, she explained. &quot;It&#x27;s cool because &quot;Fallen&quot; really is a lot of compromise. It definitely leaned toward what he wanted a lot of the time.&quot; Creative restrictions included instrumentation decisions such as her wanting to play organ on the record and Moody not wanting that. She stated that at one point, all her &quot;pianoplaying rights were stripped away&quot; from her because Moody felt she &quot;was getting too much attention&quot;, so a keyboard player was hired. During the making of the album, &quot;there was so much back-and-forth and so much turmoil between us and the label and each other. I always had to fight to get my music made and I remember focussing more than anything on the work and on the fights and on, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna make this right&#x27;&quot;, she recalled. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of the way that it went, but it wasn&#x27;t easy.&quot; &quot;A lot of the reason it&#x27;s been so much fun writing [post-Moody] is that we&#x27;re not thinking about that. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;What do we like? What&#x27;s fun?&#x27;&quot;, and there is &quot;no pressure of wanting to rule the world&quot;.

Moody said in a 2003 interview that he focused on making the album &quot;as accessible as possible, to as many people as possible&quot;. In 2005, he conceded that he and Lee had different approaches for the music, stating, &quot;[Amy] is much more creative than I am ... I am a bit more commercial minded ... she is more educated musically, and she wanted to explore that. ... it was like my way or the highway. We just couldn&#x27;t meet in the middle, so I was like, &quot;The hell with it.&quot; He also said that he struggled with substance abuse during his time in Evanescence. In August 2010, he released a statement on his history with Lee and Evanescence, where he said that he was a different person at the time, his friendship with Lee had deteriorated, and they had conflicting opinions, personalities, and desires with the band. Moody apologized to Lee for comments he made to her in anger. He said he realized the band would end if he stayed and believes he made the right choice. He added, &quot;Evanescence has progressed a great distance from the original sound, and made it clear that they intended to expand much further. Amy is very artistic and never has had a problem thinking outside of the box and defying expectations.&quot;

Lee called former Cold guitarist Terry Balsamo, with whom Evanescence had toured, to replace Moody on the &quot;Fallen&quot; tour. Balsamo soon joined Evanescence as the permanent lead guitarist. She and Balsamo &quot;clicked&quot; and &quot;connected on a lot of musical interests&quot;. The band played several shows with Korn in Europe, with Evanescence originally set to headline however Lee wanted Korn to headline instead. &quot;Fallen&quot;″s third single &quot;My Immortal&quot; was released on December 8, 2003, and peaked at number seven on the US Hot 100 and the UK singles chart.

At the 46th Grammy Awards in February 2004, Evanescence won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and Best New Artist from five nominations. On May 31, 2004, &quot;Fallen&quot;″s fourth and final single &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was released, and peaked at number 36 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, and number 24 on the UK singles chart. Lee had begun writing music again by November, including the songs &quot;Lacrymosa&quot; and &quot;Together Again&quot;, which she initially wrote for the soundtrack of the 2005 film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; but were rejected by the studio.

During the &quot;Fallen&quot; tour, Lee wrote a song titled &quot;The Last Song I&#x27;m Wasting on You&quot;, recording it in a bathroom on an analog recording device. It became a B-side on the single &quot;Lithium&quot; from Evanescence&#x27;s second album. When asked if the track was about former bandmate Moody, Lee said, &quot;If I answer that, then I&#x27;m not hiding anything anymore. But I just sort of answered it, didn&#x27;t I?&quot;. She later deemed it &quot;one of those personal, hard moments, when beauty is born out of pain&quot;. On November 24, 2004, Evanescence released their first live album and concert DVD titled &quot;Anywhere but Home&quot;, which includes a concert in Paris, a live cover of Korn&#x27;s &quot;Thoughtless&quot;, behind-the-scenes footage, three previously unreleased songs, and &quot;Fallen&quot;″s four music videos. The album sold more than a million copies worldwide.

&quot;Fallen&quot; spent 43 weeks in the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number three. It was listed for 104 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it was one of eight albums in the history of the chart to spend at least a year in the top 50. &quot;Fallen&quot; was also number six on CBS&#x27;s list of &quot;Top Bestselling Albums of the Last 10 Years&quot;. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in April 2003 and 4× platinum in January 2004. It has sold more than 17 million worldwide, including 10 million in the US, since its release.

In 2023, Lee recalled the journey of early success, stating that &quot;there was a lot to be excited about, but there was a lot of hard stuff going on in the background. Not just drama about what we were doing, but also my brother was sick, and it was a scary time to be out on my own. And I did, in a lot of ways at that time, feel alone.&quot; She found the extensive exposure and objectification at that age difficult to handle, and did not feel supported by those around her. With everything happening, she was &quot;just sure it was always right about to fall apart.&quot; She described facing a lot of obstacles, including attempts at control and manipulation behind the scenes, as well as being considered just the singer/frontwoman among the men, and learning to say no to things. Lee deemed the &quot;fight for credibility&quot; as a creator to be one of the biggest challenges she faced early on with the &quot;Fallen&quot; era, explaining: &quot;It was the mentality of labels to tell, especially newer artists, that they need to have writers. ... And the reason that they wanted [men] to do it was because that&#x27;s where the money was. That&#x27;s where the power was. Everybody else wanted to be able to say they did that when I did that&quot;. She also noted that, for being the frontwoman &quot;people assume that it&#x27;s not yours. And some of the people around me were more than happy to let them believe that.&quot;

===2004–2007: &quot;The Open Door&quot;===
Lee musically collaborated with Balsamo for Evanescence&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Open Door&quot; (2006). They began writing together in March 2004, after finishing the tour for &quot;Fallen&quot;. The album progressed slowly for several reasons, including Lee&#x27;s desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, Balsamo&#x27;s stroke, and turbulence with their former manager. The writing experience for &quot;The Open Door&quot; was &quot;the best process&quot; Lee ever had because she had &quot;free rein&quot; and could &quot;do whatever I wanted without being judged&quot;. She called this period a &quot;beautiful time of independence&quot;. &quot;I was still learning who I was and still growing, and wanted the space to be able to try stuff.&quot; She was inspired to make &quot;homemade sounds&quot; and incorporate other elements into the music.

In 2006, Lee said that when she listened back to &quot;Fallen&quot;, she &quot;hear[d] all the vulnerability and the fear and all the childish things in me that are just human.&quot; While Lee was drowning in the misery of her experiences in &quot;Fallen&quot;, she said &quot;The Open Door&quot; is largely about her acknowledging her issues and deliberating &quot;what do I have to do to work this out.&quot; &quot;There were things for me to get over&quot;, she explained. &quot;I could just have shut up and stayed stuck in a lot of negative situations and not done anything, and on the outside it would have looked like everything was fine for me&quot;. In the record, she is &quot;purging the trials&quot;, but overall it comes from a less hopeless place and with a more reflective outlook. She also used her experience as a lone female and &quot;hard adjustment&quot; with the fame the &quot;Fallen&quot; era brought as inspiration for the album.

On July 13, 2006, Lee announced that bassist Will Boyd had left the band after the album was completed for &quot;not wanting to do another big tour&quot; and wanting &quot;to be close to his family&quot;. In an interview with MTV, Lee announced that Tim McCord, former Revolution Smile guitarist, would switch instruments and play bass for the band.

&quot;The Open Door&quot;″s lead single &quot;Call Me When You&#x27;re Sober&quot; hit modern rock and alternative rock radio on August 7, 2006. The 13-track album was released in the US and Canada on October 3, 2006; the United Kingdom on October 2, 2006; and Australia on September 30, 2006. The album sold 447,000 copies in the US in its first week of sales and earned their first No. 1 ranking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The music video for &quot;Call Me When You&#x27;re Sober&quot; was shot in Los Angeles and is based on the fairy tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. &quot;The Open Door&quot; became available for pre-order on the iTunes Store on August 15, 2006; the music video for &quot;Call Me When You&#x27;re Sober&quot; was also made available.

The tour for &quot;The Open Door&quot; began on October 5, 2006, in Toronto, and included locations in Canada, the U.S., and Europe during that year. This first tour continued on January 5, 2007, and included stops in Canada (alongside band Stone Sour), Japan, and Australia (alongside band Shihad), and then returned to the U.S. for a second tour in the spring (alongside bands Chevelle and Finger Eleven). As part of their tour, Evanescence performed on April 15, 2007, on the Argentinian festival Quilmes Rock 07 along with Aerosmith, Velvet Revolver, and other local bands.

On May 4, 2007, guitarist John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit. Former Evanescence player David Hodges commented on LeCompt and Gray&#x27;s attitude, stating: &quot;The only thing I would have done differently than Amy in the last two years is distance myself sooner from [them].&quot; Lee stated that LeCompt and Gray had joined as tour players after &quot;Fallen&quot; was made, and were treated as full members with their picture on album images. When it came to making the second album, she and Balsamo tried writing with them but they were ultimately not compatible. Lee said LeCompt and Gray disliked the music, were vocal about not caring about the band and that they stayed around for the money, they had been working on their other projects, but chose to stay as live players for Evanescence while planning to leave at another time. She added that she &quot;knowingly let this negative energy grow within my band for a very long time because I was afraid of the appearance of falling apart when in reality trying to hold on to these guys is what was holding us back.&quot; In 2010, LeCompt said of his time in the band, &quot;[Evanescence] was so big and important to my career and my life so I look back on it with fondness. We left the band but that doesn&#x27;t say anything about my time in that band.&quot;

On May 17, 2007, former Dark New Day members, drummer Will Hunt and guitarist Troy McLawhorn were announced to have joined Evanescence on tour, replacing Gray and LeCompt. Lee and Balsamo said that the addition of Hunt and McLawhorn was good for the band, as they&#x27;re easy to get along with, have similar tastes, are passionate players, have good energy on stage, and enjoy being in the band. The band finished their European tour with a sell-out concert at the Amphi in Ra&#x27;anana, Israel, on June 26, 2007. After the European tour, they co-headlined Korn&#x27;s Family Values Tour 2007 in the US, and followed it with a headlining tour in the US. After the end of the album&#x27;s tour, Lee took a break to recollect herself and live life away from the industry. By October 2011, &quot;The Open Door&quot; had sold six million copies worldwide.

===2009–2014: &quot;Evanescence&quot; and hiatus===
About 18 months after Lee stepped away from the industry, she began writing music again, and went into the studio with producer Steve Lillywhite. In a news posting to the Evanescence website during June 2009, Lee wrote that the band was in the process of writing new material for a new album proposed for release in 2010. The band played a &quot;secret show&quot; at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in New York City on November 4, 2009, with label mates Civil Twilight. Tickets for the show sold out in five minutes. This show acted as a warm-up for their headline appearance at the Maquinária Festival in São Paulo, Brazil, which took place on November 8.

In January 2010, Evanescence released &quot;Together Again&quot; as a digital download, a song created for &quot;The Open Door&quot; but later cut. The song was released to aid the United Nations Foundation in Haiti earthquake recovery efforts. It later received an official release as a digital download on February 23, 2010.

Evanescence entered the studio on February 22, 2010, to begin recording for the new album, with Will &quot;Science&quot; Hunt assisting in programming. David Campbell, who previously worked on &quot;The Open Door&quot;, was brought back to handle string arrangements, and the album was initially being produced by Lillywhite. Lee later said that &quot;Steve wasn&#x27;t the right fit&quot; and was replaced by producer Nick Raskulinecz. It was later revealed that the record label had scrapped the material recorded with Lillywhite.

At the time the band began recording, the album was intended for an August or September 2010 release. However, on June 21, 2010, Lee announced on EvThreads.com that Evanescence had temporarily left the studio to work further on the album and &quot;get our heads into the right creative space&quot;. Lee also indicated that record label Wind-up Records was going through &quot;uncertain times&quot;, which would further delay the release of the album. The band reentered the studio in early April 2011 with Raskulinecz, who had produced music for Alice in Chains, Deftones, and Foo Fighters, to continue work on the third album. It was reported that the album would be released in late 2011.

On June 12, 2011, Lee announced through her Twitter account that guitarist Troy McLawhorn, who worked with Seether for a time and left, was officially back with Evanescence, and the release date for their new album would be October 4, 2011. Later, on July 11, 2011, it was reported by MTV News that the release date for the album had been pushed back to October 11, and that the first single from the album will be &quot;What You Want&quot;. The band recorded the album at Blackbird Studio in Nashville. During an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Lee revealed that the new album&#x27;s title will be &quot;Evanescence&quot;. Lee said that the decision for the title of the album was her love towards Evanescence, as well as the record being composed more collaboratively than past albums, with all members contributing. The record is &quot;about the band&quot;, Lee explained. Its lyrical themes include Lee &quot;falling back in love&quot; with Evanescence, her being inspired by nature and the ocean, brokenness, the quest for freedom, and falling in love. Different from &quot;The Open Door&quot;, which was &quot;all about me and my personal experiences&quot;, &quot;Evanescence&quot; also includes Lee&#x27;s musings on events that occurred to others in her life. &quot;But really, whatever makes me feel the most, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on the record, because that&#x27;s what I need to get off my chest.&quot;

&quot;Evanescence&quot; debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 127,000 in the US, becoming the band&#x27;s second number one album on the chart after &quot;The Open Door&quot;. The &quot;Evanescence&quot; Tour began on August 17, 2011, with a show at War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville. The band then performed at Rock on the Range in Winnipeg on August 20, 2011, and at Rock in Rio on October 2 alongside Guns N&#x27; Roses and System of a Down as well as Brazilian artists Pitty and Detonautas Roque Clube. After a series of events in North America, Evanescence traveled to Europe in November to play a sold-out tour in the UK, Germany and France, with support from The Pretty Reckless and Australian band ME. Evanescence performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert on December 11, 2011, where they played &quot;Lost in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, before again touring in North America. In February 2012 they toured Japan with Dazzle Vision, and in the same month performed in other southeast Asian countries. March 2012 saw the band tour Australia and New Zealand with Blaqk Audio. Between April and July 2012, Evanescence toured in Europe and North America, with additional stops in Africa and the Middle East.

Evanescence took part in the Carnival of Madness Tour alongside Halestorm, Cavo, New Medicine, and Chevelle. The tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo. The &quot;Evanescence&quot; Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica, and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London&#x27;s Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band planned to take an extended break after the tour, saying, &quot;At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order. I think at the end of the run we&#x27;ll go on a break for a while and figure things out.&quot;

In October 2013, Wind-up Records sold their back catalog of artists, including Evanescence and their master recordings, to Bicycle Music Company. The combined company Concord Bicycle Music will market the catalog. On January 3, 2014, it was announced that Lee had filed a lawsuit against Wind-up Records, seeking $1.5 million in unpaid royalties owed to the band. The lawsuit was settled and Lee said she had to sign a non-disclosure agreement that she could not say anything negative, &quot;so that&#x27;s the only way in any sense that I&#x27;m still bound&quot;. In March 2014, Lee announced via her Twitter account that she and Evanescence had been released from their record label contract and were independent artists.

===2015–2018: Return and &quot;Synthesis&quot;===

On April 27, 2015, it was announced that the band would perform at Japan&#x27;s Ozzfest on November 21, 2015, as the second headline act. On August 7, 2015, Lee announced that long-time guitarist Terry Balsamo had departed the band. His position was filled by German guitarist Jen Majura, who was recommended by Testament&#x27;s Alex Skolnick.

In an October 2015 interview, Lee stated that she was focusing on solo projects so there were no current plans for new Evanescence music yet, but the band would continue to tour through 2016. &quot;It feels really good to have a lot of different things going on at once in the sense that I feel like I&#x27;m not just flexing one muscle&quot;, she said. The band made their return to the stage in November 2015, playing three US shows and performing at Ozzfest in Tokyo, Japan, marking their first live performances since their hiatus.

In February 2016, Lee said the band was working on the six-LP vinyl box set titled &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which includes all three studio albums, the previously unreleased 2000 demo CD &quot;Origin&quot;, the rarities compilation album &quot;Lost Whispers&quot;, a studio version of the tour intro &quot;Lost Whispers&quot;, a studio recording of the song &quot;Even In Death&quot;, alongside a 52-page casebound book with art, handwritten lyrics, photos and rarities. The box set was released in February 2017, and the compilation album &quot;Lost Whispers&quot; was made available for streaming and downloading on Spotify, iTunes, and Anghami. It contains the re-recorded &quot;Even in Death&quot;, previously released B-sides, the four deluxe edition bonus tracks to &quot;Evanescence&quot;, and the new song &quot;Lost Whispers&quot;.

In the fall of 2016, the band toured select cities in the US, choosing alternative rock band Veridia as their opener. During this tour, the band played a new song titled &quot;Take Cover&quot;, an outtake from the scrapped 2010 sessions for their self-titled album. In an October 2016 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot;, Lee confirmed that &quot;there is Evanescence in the future&quot;, adding that she wants to take things step by step. She said in another interview that the band was not making a new album yet but working on a project that was &quot;not exactly the most traditional thing&quot;, something that would take fans on a &quot;different path that we wanna try&quot;. In February 2017, it was confirmed that the band was working in the studio.

In a March 2017 interview with AOL Build, Lee spoke about her solo single, &quot;Speak to Me&quot; and &quot;a new album&quot; in the works by Evanescence, stating, &quot;We&#x27;re working on something. [...] It&#x27;s not just a straightforward &#x27;next Evanescence album&#x27;&quot;. In a March 23 interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, Lee stated that &quot;It&#x27;s something unique, something complex, something a little bit beyond that – and it&#x27;s definitely new territory for all of us.&quot; The album was intended for release later in 2017.

In a Facebook post, Lee revealed that the new album is titled &quot;Synthesis&quot;. It is an orchestral and electronica piece, with selected songs from the band&#x27;s previous albums rebuilt into classical arrangements reminiscent of a soundtrack, Lee said. &quot;Synthesis&quot; contains two new original songs: &quot;Hi-Lo&quot; featuring violinist Lindsey Stirling, and &quot;Imperfection&quot;. The first recording session for &quot;Synthesis&quot; took place on May 23, 2017, and a remake of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was released as a single on August 18. On August 15, the band announced that recording &quot;Synthesis&quot; was in its final stages. Evanescence toured with a full orchestra in late 2017 in support of the album, and tickets were sold starting on August 18. The band later toured across the US, Australia and Europe. Each ticket purchased came with a digital copy of &quot;Synthesis&quot; after its release. On September 14, 2017, the single &quot;Imperfection&quot; was officially released.

In March 2018, Evanescence announced that Lindsey Stirling would be joining the second North American leg as part of Evanescence&#x27;s &quot;Synthesis Tour&quot;. While their focus would remain on touring, Lee stated during a July 2018 interview on WRIF that the band would begin working on their next studio album.

===2019–present: &quot;The Bitter Truth&quot;===

On February 4, 2019, the band released dates and locations for a spring/summer 2019 US concert tour. In May 2019, former guitarist Terry Balsamo performed with the band again at a live show for the song &quot;Sweet Sacrifice&quot;. On May 11, 2019, Lee was quoted by &quot;Blabbermouth&quot; on plans for Evanescence to release a new studio album in 2020. In a November 21, 2019, Reddit AMA, Lee said of the album, &quot;It&#x27;s dark and heavy. Its also got moments of weird and sparse. Little bit of everything. Definitely some &quot;Open Door&quot; vibes but not the same.&quot;

On September 17, 2019, Evanescence and symphonic metal band Within Temptation announced a seven-city joint European tour titled Worlds Collide originally scheduled for April 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed for September 2020. It was then pushed back a second time to take place in September 2021. The tour had to be rescheduled a third time, with March 2022 set as the start date. The last postponement was announced in February 2022, with the tour scheduled for November and December 2022.

On September 5, 2019, Xbox released a launch trailer for the video game &quot;Gears 5&quot; that included a version of Lee&#x27;s cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;The Chain&quot;. Initially a solo project by Lee, she then got approval to cover the song with the band and a full version of the song was released by Evanescence on November 22, 2019, which features backing vocals by the other members of the band. The cover hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Digital Song Sales chart. A music video for the song was released on January 9, 2020. The cover song would not be included on the band&#x27;s upcoming fifth album.

At the end of January 2020, the band entered the studio with Nick Raskulinecz, who produced their 2011 self-titled album, to work on three &quot;heavy&quot; songs. They would originally record only two songs with him, but ended up recording four. They planned to work piecemeal with the recording process, finishing a few songs with a producer and then working on a few other songs with another producer, but this plan was set aside because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 17, 2020, the band announced the title of their new album, &quot;The Bitter Truth&quot;, along with the artwork. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Wasted on You&quot;, was released on April 24 along with a music video. The music video was directed by P. R. Brown and included shots of the band members, at home due to the pandemic. The second single, &quot;The Game Is Over&quot;, was released on July 1. &quot;Use My Voice&quot;, the album&#x27;s third single, was released on August 14. It features backing vocals from Lzzy Hale, Lindsey Stirling, Taylor Momsen, Deena Jakoub, and Sharon den Adel, and was used in a HeadCount campaign to encourage Americans to vote in the United States presidential election.
On December 4, 2020, it was announced that the album would be released on March 26, 2021, and contain 12 tracks, including &quot;Evanescence&quot; outtake &quot;Take Cover&quot;. Along with the album&#x27;s pre-order, the fourth single, &quot;Yeah Right&quot;, was released as an instant grab. On March 5, 2021, the band released the fifth single, &quot;Better Without You&quot;. The song touches upon Lee&#x27;s struggle in the music industry. A &quot;Kerrang!&quot; cover story stated that Lee considers &quot;The Bitter Truth&quot; their fourth album, not 2017&#x27;s &quot;Synthesis&quot;, though it is the fifth album overall.

Evanescence and Halestorm&#x27;s US tour was announced in May 2021 for the fall. The tour began on November 5, 2021, with the last city stop set for December 18, 2021. More dates were added in September 2021. In December 2021, the last five shows were rescheduled due to COVID-19 cases within the band&#x27;s touring camp, with the tour completed in January 2022. Evanescence was voted by &quot;Revolver&quot; readers one of the top five live bands of 2021, with &quot;Revolver&quot; stating that &quot;The Bitter Truth&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t just a return for Evanescence — it was a rebirth.&quot;

In February 2022, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;&#x27;s music video surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube. In May 2022, the band announced that it parted ways with guitarist Jen Majura, and longtime bassist Tim McCord would switch to guitar while Emma Anzai of Sick Puppies would join as their new bassist. On July 15, 2022, Evanescence headlined the Rock Fest festival.

Evanescence and Korn co-headlined an 18-dates US summer tour from August 16 to September 16, 2022. The band also played Rocklahoma festival in early September, and the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento, California the following month. After four rescheduled attempts since 2019, Evanescence&#x27;s co-headlining Worlds Collide European tour with Within Temptation began on November 9, 2022, running until December 8, 2022. According to &quot;Loudwire&quot; in August 2022, Evanescence have sold a total of 31.9 million albums, making the band one of the best selling hard rock and metal artists of all time.

Evanescence joined Muse on their North American tour from February to April 2023. In May, the band performed at the inaugural Sick New World festival in Las Vegas, and Welcome to Rockville festival in Florida. The following month, they traveled to Europe to play the German festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Download Festival&#x27;s 20th anniversary in England, where they played to what was deemed the biggest crowd ever for the second stage and their performance was listed by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as one of the 20 greatest Download festival sets ever, and a solo show in Poland and France. They then performed at Japan&#x27;s Summer Sonic Festival on August 19–20, and toured Australia from August 24 to September 2. The band returned to the US to play Blue Ridge Rock Festival on September 7, and a show in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 8. From October 7 to October 28, they embarked on a Latin American tour across Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The band played their biggest solo show ever at the Allianz Parque stadium in São Paulo, Brazil. In November, Evanescence was awarded &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 2023 Hall of Fame award.

==Artistry==

===Musical style===

Evanescence blends various musical styles in their music, primarily rock, classical, alternative, heavy metal, industrial, and electronic. Music journalists vary in terming Evanescence a rock or metal band, and many identify gothic elements in their music. The band is generally classified as alternative metal, gothic rock, gothic metal, and hard rock. Other genres used to describe the band&#x27;s sound over the years include industrial rock, symphonic metal, nu metal, and symphonic rock. Evanescence have also incorporated other styles in their music, including several forms of electronic music, progressive rock, R&amp;B, soul, trip hop, and Eastern music.

&quot;Metal Injection&quot; deemed them &quot;gothic-tinged alternative metal mainstays&quot;, and AllMusic described their music as &quot;alt-metal that layers orchestral and electronic touches atop brooding goth rock&quot;. Regarding the early classification of Evanescence as nu-metal, &quot;Loudwire&quot; said that this occurred due to their debut album being released at a time &quot;when nu-metal was essentially at its peak&quot; and they &quot;were one of the only bands fronted by a woman that was headlining massive rock and metal festivals with Korn and the like, so putting them in the same category was likely appropriate&quot;, while their music also had &quot;nu-metal elements in addition to gothic metal&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said in 2006 that Lee working with any group of musicians in the band &quot;is going to sound like Evanescence -- dark, stormy, anguished, seeking both release and transcendence.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; characterized the band&#x27;s sound as a &quot;melodic crush of haunting, baroque harmonies and heavy guitars&quot;.

Evanescence &quot;has long had dual personalities, mixing alt-metal and symphonic rock on its three studio albums&quot;, while their fourth, &quot;Synthesis&quot;, focuses on &quot;orchestral grandeur&quot; with electronic percussion, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; said the band &quot;has long been known to mix beauty and bombast&quot;, with &quot;Synthesis&quot; and its live orchestra-backed show turning Lee&#x27;s &quot;wrenching, introspective songs into neo-operatic anthems&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; depicted the band&#x27;s sound after &quot;Synthesis&quot; as &quot;evolving from its nu-metal/post-grunge origins to, naturally, a synthesis of rock, classical and EDM&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of Evanescence&#x27;s musical evolution: &quot;Over the years and through multiple lineup shifts, the band persevered under Lee&#x27;s helm, eventually shifting from the radio-friendly anthems of their early days into a shimmering, classically inspired symphonic alternative outfit in the 2010s&quot;.

Lee is Evanescence&#x27;s main songwriter since its start. Musically led by Lee, Evanescence was originally a duo partnership, its music written by Lee and the lead guitarist until the self-titled third album, which was the first album written by Evanescence as a band. Since then, Evanescence has been a band collaboration, with Lee and the rest of the band musically co-writing and combining their work.

===Influences===
Lee&#x27;s musical influences throughout childhood and her teenage years included classical music, Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s film scores, alternative music, grunge, hard rock, industrial music, death metal, groove metal, and electronica artists like Bjork and Portishead. Her earliest memory of wanting to fuse various and contrasting musical styles, was when she was training in classical piano and realized that a section of a composition from Baroque composer Bach resembled heavy metal. Lee considers the &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; movement of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem her favorite piece of music, and wove it into &quot;The Open Door&quot; song &quot;Lacrymosa&quot;.

With Evanescence, Lee aimed to combine her various musical tastes, including &quot;bringing something from the cinematic and classical symphonic world and marrying it to metal, hard rock and alternative music&quot;. &quot;There was all this music that was inspiring me. And Evanescence was the product of these two extremes combining&quot;. Contrasting sounds is an element of Evanescence music, with Lee noting that alongside rock and metal, the band has &quot;always had programming and inspirations from Bjork, Depeche Mode and Massive Attack and that kind of thing&quot;.

Evanescence cite Soundgarden, Björk, Mozart, Danny Elfman, Korn, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Pantera, Portishead, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, Garbage, Depeche Mode, and A Perfect Circle as influences.

===Impact===
Various publications have noted Evanescence&#x27;s musical and gendered impact in rock. The band&#x27;s symphonic gothic rock style was not present in the mainstream music industry, and their success among &quot;testosterone-driven and male-dominated&quot; rock radio was a rarity. Evanescence was an &quot;anomaly&quot; breaking into the mainstream, and played a &quot;large part in mainstream-rock radio opening its mind to playing a female voice on the airwaves&quot;, &quot;Consequence&quot; wrote. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said Evanescence &quot;brought theatrics and a much-needed femininity to the hard-rock boys&#x27; club of the early 2000s&quot;. Lee &quot;broke down the doors of the alternative metal boys club&quot;, AllMusic stated, and was a &quot;disrupter&quot; of the early 2000s mainstream music scene. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted that &quot;the people who doubted that pianos or female vocals belonged in rock music were quickly proven wrong&quot; with Evanescence albums&#x27; success and Lee&#x27;s &quot;singular voice in a scene dominated by macho aggression&quot;. Evanescence had a &quot;big&quot; impact &quot;on the next generation of bands&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote, and Lee &quot;has helped light the path for many dauntless young women in music&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; stated. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named Evanescence &quot;one of heavy music&#x27;s most important, influential and relevant bands&quot;, and remarked that there is &quot;a timelessness about their sound that&#x27;s barely dated over the last two decades&quot; and their &quot;emotional potency has only been enhanced&quot;.

<text>Journalism scandals are high-profile incidents or acts, whether intentional or accidental, that run contrary to the generally accepted ethics and standards of journalism, or otherwise violate the &#x27;ideal&#x27; mission of journalism: to report news events and issues accurately and fairly.

As the investigative and reporting face of the media, journalists are usually required to follow various journalistic standards. These may be written and codified, or customary expectations. Typical standards include references to honesty, avoiding journalistic bias, demonstrating responsibility, striking an appropriate balance between privacy and public interest, shunning financial or romantic conflict of interest, and choosing ethical means to obtain information. Penalties may vary, but have been known to include re-assignment to other jobs in the same company.

Journalistic scandals are public scandals arising from incidents where in the eyes of some party, these standards were significantly breached. In most journalistic scandals, deliberate or accidental acts take place that run contrary to the generally accepted ethics and standards of journalism, or otherwise violate the &#x27;ideal&#x27; mission of journalism: to report news events and issues accurately and fairly.

==Common characteristics==
Journalistic scandals include: plagiarism, fabrication, and omission of information; activities that violate the law, or violate ethical rules; the altering or staging of an event being documented; or making substantial reporting or researching errors with the results leading to libelous or defamatory statements.

All journalistic scandals have the common factor that they call into question the integrity and truthfulness of journalism. These scandals shift public focus and scrutiny onto the media itself.
Because credibility is journalism&#x27;s main currency, many news agencies and mass media outlets have strict codes of conduct and enforce them, and use several layers of editorial oversight to catch problems before stories are distributed.

However, in some cases, investigations later found that long-established journalistic checks and balances in the newsrooms failed. In some cases, senior editors fail to catch bias, libel, or fabrication inserted into a story by a reporter. 

In other cases, the checks and balances were omitted in the rush to get an important, &#x27;breaking&#x27; news story to press (or on air). Furthermore, in many libel and defamation cases, the publication would have had full support of editorial oversight in case of yellow journalism.

<doc id="225283" wikidata="Q213394" url="?curid=225283" title="Sri Lankan civil war">
<text>The Sri Lankan civil war (; ) was a civil war fought in Sri Lanka from 1983 to 2009. Beginning on 23 July 1983, it was an intermittent insurgency against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, also known as the Tamil Tigers) led by Velupillai Prabhakaran. The LTTE fought to create an independent Tamil state called Tamil Eelam in the north-east of the island, due to the continuous discrimination and violent persecution against Sri Lankan Tamils by the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka government.

Violent persecution erupted in the form of the 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983 anti-Tamil pogroms, as well as the 1981 burning of the Jaffna Public Library. These were carried out by the majority Sinhalese mobs often with state support, in the years following Sri Lanka&#x27;s independence from the British Empire in 1948. Shortly after gaining independence, Sinhalese was recognized as the sole official language of the nation. After a 26-year military campaign, the Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers in May 2009, bringing the civil war to an end.

Up to 70,000 had been killed by 2007. Immediately following the end of war, on 20 May 2009, the UN estimated a total of 80,000–100,000 deaths. However, in 2011, referring to the final phase of the war in 2009, the Report of the Secretary-General&#x27;s Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka stated, &quot;A number of credible sources have estimated that there could have been as many as 40,000 civilian deaths.&quot; The Sri Lankan government has repeatedly refused an independent, international investigation to ascertain the full impact of the war, with some reports claiming that government forces were raping and torturing Tamils involved in collating deaths and disappearances.

Since the end of the civil war, the Sri Lankan state has been subject to much global criticism for violating human rights as a result of committing war crimes through bombing civilian targets, usage of heavy weaponry, the abduction and massacres of Sri Lankan Tamils and sexual violence. The LTTE gained notoriety for carrying out numerous attacks against civilians of all ethnicities, particularly those of Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Muslim ethnicity, using child soldiers, assassinations of politicians and dissenters, and the use of suicide bombings against military, political and civilian targets.

==Origin and evolution==
The origins of the Sri Lankan civil war lie in the continuous political rancour between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The roots of the modern conflict extend back to the colonial era, when the country was known as Ceylon. The British colonial period lasted from 1815 to 1948, during which the British sought monetary gain from Sri Lanka&#x27;s supply of tea, coffee, coconuts, and rubber. A labour shortage led the British to employ Tamils from India to work on tea plantations, furthering fears of racial decline among the Sinhalese. English language schools were also established in Jaffna by the American Ceylon Mission, which provided English-language skills for the Tamil population in Jaffna. The British favored English speakers, so Tamils outcompeted their Sinhalese counterparts in the civil service sector.

In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organizations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of Ponnambalam Arunachalam, to press the colonial government for more constitutional reforms. British colonial administrator William Manning actively encouraged the concept of &quot;communal representation&quot; and created the Colombo town seat in 1920, which alternated between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.

After their election to the State Council in 1936, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) members N.M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November 1936, a motion that &quot;in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the vernacular&quot; and that &quot;entries in police stations should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated&quot; were passed by the State Council and referred to the Legal Secretary. However, in 1944, J.R. Jayawardena moved in the State Council that Sinhala should replace English as the official language.

Ethnic tensions were exacerbated immediately after independence in 1948, when a controversial law was passed by the Ceylon Parliament called the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which deliberately discriminated against the Indian Tamil ethnic minority by making it virtually impossible for them to obtain citizenship in the country. Approximately 700,000 Indian Tamils were made stateless. Over the next three decades, more than 300,000 Indian Tamils were deported back to India. It wasn&#x27;t until 2003 – 55 years after independence – that all Indian Tamils living in Sri Lanka were granted citizenship, but, by this time, they only made up 5% of the island&#x27;s population.

Prior to 1950, various minority groups, excluding the Sri Lankan Tamils, had been attacked by Sinhalese Buddhists, these included Christians, Muslims and Malayalis. The Sri Lankan Tamils however had remained largely untouched. Early Sinhala Buddhist propaganda was directed mainly against foreign and religious ethnic minorities. This changed in the 1950s as the Sri Lankan Tamils were rediscovered to be the &#x27;traditional enemy of the Sinhalese&#x27;.

At the time of independence in 1948, Tamils comprised around 30% of the higher ranks of civil service, while comprising around 20% of the island&#x27;s population. In 1956 Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike passed the &quot;Sinhala Only Act&quot;, which replaced English with Sinhala as the only official language of the country. This was seen as a deliberate attempt to discourage the Sri Lankan Tamils from working in the Ceylon Civil Service and other public services. The Tamil-speaking minorities of Ceylon (Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Moors) viewed the Act as linguistic, cultural and economic discrimination against them. Many Tamil-speaking civil servants/public servants were forced to resign because they weren&#x27;t fluent in Sinhala. Tension over this policy led to the 1956 anti-Tamil pogrom and the 1958 anti-Tamil pogrom, in which Sinhalese mobs attacked hundreds of Tamils in Sinhalese-majority areas. Sinhalese in Tamil-majority areas were also attacked by Tamil mobs. Dozens, if not hundreds, mostly Tamils, perished, while thousands of both groups fled to areas where they were in the majority. The civil war was a direct result of the escalation of the confrontational politics that followed.

In the late 1960s several Tamil youth, among them Velupillai Prabhakaran, also became involved in these activities. They carried out several hit-and-run operations against pro-government Tamil politicians, Sri Lanka police and the civil administration.

During the 1970s the Policy of standardization was initiated. Under the policy, students were admitted to university in proportion to the number of applicants who sat for the examination in their language. Officially the policy was designed to increase the representation of students from rural areas. In practice the policy reduced the numbers of Sri Lankan Tamil students who had previously, based on their examination scores alone, gained admission in a higher proportion than their participation in the examination. They were now required to gain higher marks than Sinhalese students to gain admission to universities. For instance, the qualifying mark for admission to the medical faculties was 250 out of 400 for Tamil students, but only 229 for Sinhalese. The number of Sri Lankan Tamil students entering universities fell dramatically. The policy was abandoned in 1977.

Other forms of official discrimination against the Sri Lankan Tamils included the state-sponsored colonization of traditional Tamil areas by Sinhalese peasants, the banning of the import of Tamil-language media and the preference given by the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka to Buddhism, the main religion followed by the Sinhalese.

Prabhakaran formed the Tamil New Tigers (TNT) in 1972.

The formation of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) with the Vaddukkodei (Vattukottai) resolution of 1976 led to a hardening of attitudes. The resolution called for the creation of a secular, socialist state of Tamil Eelam, based on the right of self-determination.

The TULF clandestinely supported the armed actions of the young militants who were dubbed &quot;our boys&quot;. TULF leader Appapillai Amirthalingam even provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N.S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE. The &quot;boys&quot; were the product of the post-war population explosion. Many partially educated, unemployed Tamil youth fell for revolutionary solutions to their problems. The leftist parties had remained &quot;non-communal&quot; for a long time, but the Federal Party (as well as its offshoot, the TULF), deeply conservative and dominated by Vellalar casteism, did not attempt to form a national alliance with the leftists in their fight for language rights.

Following the sweeping electoral victory of the United National Party (UNP) in July 1977, the TULF became the leading opposition party, with around one-sixth of the total electoral vote winning on a party platform of secession from Sri Lanka. After the 1977 riots the J.R. Jayewardene government made one concession to the Tamil population; it lifted the policy of standardization for university admission that had driven many Tamil youths into militancy. The concession was regarded by the militants as too little too late, and violent attacks continued. By this time TULF started losing its grip over the militant groups. LTTE ordered civilians to boycott the local government elections of 1983 in which even TULF contested. Voter turnout was as low as 10%. Thereafter, Tamil political parties were unable to represent the interests of the Tamil community.

==Outbreak of war==
===Eelam War I (1983–1987)===
Supported by the ongoing politics of conflict in Sri Lanka, politicised Tamil youth in the north and east started to form militant groups. These groups developed independently of the Colombo Tamil leadership, and in the end rejected and annihilated them. The most prominent of these groups was the TNT, which changed its name to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or the LTTE, in 1976. The LTTE initially carried out a campaign of violence against the state, particularly targeting policemen and also moderate Tamil politicians who attempted a dialogue with the government. Their first major operation was the assassination of the mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah, in 1975 by Prabhakaran.

The LTTE&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the early war was based on assassinations, whereas the mode of operation of the then government was through setting up a series of checkpoints around the city. The attempted assassination in 1978 of a Tamil Member of Parliament, M. Canagaratnam, was carried out personally by Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE.

In May 1981 the burning of the Jaffna library, in the presence of two Sinhalese cabinet members, by what witnesses described as uniformed police and Sinhalese mobs, resulted in the destruction of more than 90,000 books, including palm leaf scrolls of immense historical value. This violent example of ethnic biblioclasm was a major turning point in convincing the Tamil people that the government could not protect them or their cultural heritage and persuaded many of them to back a separate state.

On 23 July 1983, the LTTE ambushed the Army patrol Four Four Bravo in Thirunelveli, Jaffna and killed thirteen soldiers. The ambush provided the pretext for the pre-planned Black July pogrom to be unleashed against the Tamil community in Colombo in which 3,500-4,000 Tamils were killed. Before the pogrom the LTTE had only 30 full-time members. Subsequently, thousands of outraged Tamil youths joined Tamil militant groups to fight the Sri Lankan government, in what is considered the start of the civil war.

Apart from the LTTE, there were initially several other Tamil militant groups. The LTTE&#x27;s position, adopted from that of the PLO, was that there should be only one.

In mid-1984, Sinhalese convicts were settled in the Kent and Dollar farms in the north after the Tamil civilians living there were evicted by the Sri Lankan Police. The settlement of prisoners was used to further harass Tamils into leaving the area. The Sinhala settlers also confirmed that young Tamil women were abducted and brought there to be gang raped by the guards and prisoners. In response, the LTTE carried out the first massacre of Sinhalese civilians when it attacked the Kent and Dollar Farm in late 1984, killing 62 men, women and children. Further attacks were often carried out in revenge for attacks committed by the Sri Lankan Army, such as the Anuradhapura massacre which immediately followed the Valvettithurai massacre. The Anuradhapura massacre sparked the Kumudini boat massacre in which over 23 Tamil civilians died.

Over time the LTTE merged with or largely eliminated almost all the other militant Tamil groups. As a result, many Tamil splinter groups ended up working with the Sri Lankan government as paramilitaries or denounced violence and joined mainstream politics; some Tamil-oriented political parties remained, all opposed to LTTE&#x27;s vision of an independent state.

Peace talks between the LTTE and the government began in Thimphu in 1985, but they soon failed and the war resumed. In 1986 many civilians were massacred by the army as part of this conflict. In 1987 government troops pushed LTTE fighters to the northern city of Jaffna. In April 1987 the conflict exploded with ferocity, as both government forces and LTTE fighters engaged in a series of bloody operations.

The Sri Lankan military launched an offensive, called &quot;Operation Liberation&quot; or Vadamarachchi Operation, during May–June 1987 to regain control of the territory in the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. This marked the Sri Lankan military&#x27;s first conventional warfare on Sri Lankan soil since independence. The offensive was successful, and LTTE leader Prabhakaran and Sea Tiger leader Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan &quot;alias&quot; Soosai narrowly escaped from advancing troops at Valvettithurai. Key military personnel involved in the operation were Lt Col. Vipul Boteju, Lt. Col. Sarath Jayawardane, Col. Vijaya Wimalaratne and Brig. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa.

In July 1987 the LTTE carried out their first suicide attack. Captain Miller drove a small truck carrying explosives through the wall of a fortified Sri Lankan army camp, reportedly killing 40 soldiers. Throughout the war the LTTE would carry out over 378 suicide attacks, among the highest in the world, and the tactic became a trademark of the LTTE and a characteristic of the civil war.

===Indian intervention (1987–1990)===

Involvement was particularly strong in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where ethnic kinship led to strong support for the independence of Sri Lankan Tamils. Throughout the conflict the Indian central and state governments supported both sides in different ways. From August 1983 until May 1987 the Indian government, through its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), provided arms, training and monetary support to six Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups including LTTE, Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) and Tamil Eelam Liberation Army (TELA). LTTE&#x27;s rise is widely attributed to the initial backing it received from RAW. It is believed that by supporting different militant groups, the Indian government hoped to keep the Tamil independence movement divided and be able to exert overt control over it.

India became more actively involved in the late 1980s, and on 5 June 1987 the Indian Air Force airdropped food parcels to Jaffna while it was under siege by Sri Lankan forces. At a time when the Sri Lankan government stated it was close to defeating the LTTE, India dropped 25 tons of food and medicine by parachute into areas held by the LTTE in a direct move of support to the rebels. Negotiations were held, and the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed on 29 July 1987 by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Jayewardene. Under this accord the Sri Lankan government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including devolution of power to the provinces, a mergersubject to later referendumof the northern and eastern provinces into a single province, and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka). India agreed to establish order in the north and east through the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest disarmament of the militant groups. The Sri Lankan armed forces were confined to barracks in the north and east, and Sinhalese settlers were disarmed. In October 1987, 12 LTTE members who were prisoners of the government committed suicide, leading to anti-Sinhalese violence committed by Tamil militants, especially the LTTE, throughout the Eastern Province in which 150 Sinhalese were killed and tens of thousands were made refugees.

The signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, so soon after J.R. Jayawardene&#x27;s declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in the south. The arrival of the IPKF to take control of most areas in the north of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south to quell the protests. This led to an uprising by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years.

While most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters. Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils. Simultaneously, nationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government&#x27;s call for India to quit the island, and the government allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a cease-fire. However, the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent clashes. In April 1989 the Ranasinghe Premadasa government ordered the Sri Lanka army to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy Tamil National Army (TNA). Although casualties among the IPKF mounted, and calls for the withdrawal of the IPKF from both sides of the Sri Lankan conflict grew, Gandhi refused to remove the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, following his defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, new Prime Minister V.P. Singh ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF, and their last ship left Sri Lanka on 24 March 1990. The 32-month presence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka resulted in the deaths of 1200 Indian soldiers and over 5000 Sri Lankans. The cost for the Indian government was estimated at over ₹10.3 billion.

====Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s assassination====
Support for the LTTE in India dropped considerably in 1991, after the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by a female suicide bomber, Thenmozhi Rajaratnam. The Indian press subsequently reported that Prabhakaran decided to eliminate Gandhi, as he considered the ex-Prime Minister to be against the Tamil liberation struggle and feared that he might re-induct the IPKF, which Prabhakaran termed the &quot;satanic force&quot;, if he won the 1991 Indian general election. In 1998 a court in India presided over by Special Judge V. Navaneetham found the LTTE and its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran responsible for the assassination. In a 2006 interview, LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham expressed regret over the assassination, although he stopped short of outright acceptance of responsibility. In a 2011 interview, Kumaran Pathmanathan, who was the Treasurer of LTTE and its chief arms procurer, apologized to India for Velupillai Prabhakaran&#x27;s &quot;mistake&quot; of killing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He further said Rajiv&#x27;s assassination was &quot;well planned and done actually with Prabhakaran and (LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman). Everyone knows the truth&quot;. India remained an outside observer of the conflict after the assassination.

===Eelam War II (1990–1995)===
The violence continued unabated despite the steps taken to appease Tamil sentiments, such as the 13th Amendment (enacted in November 1987). Meanwhile, the Chief Minister of the then North and East Provincial Council, Vartharaja Perumal, put forward a 19-point demand to resolve the ethnic crisis. He threatened if these demands were not met that the Provincial Council would go ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence of the northern and eastern provinces, as in the case of Rhodesia. President Premadasa moved to quickly dissolve the Council (March 1990). At the same time LTTE used terror tactics to scare Sinhalese and Muslim farmers away from the north and east of the island, and swiftly took control of a significant portion of the territory. When the Indian Peace-Keeping Force withdrew in 1989–90, the LTTE established many government-like functions in the areas under its control. A tentative cease-fire held in 1990 as the LTTE occupied itself with destroying rival Tamil groups while the government cracked down on the JVP uprising with the Operation Combine. When both major combatants had established their power bases, they turned on each other and the cease-fire broke down. The government then launched an offensive and tried to retake Jaffna but failed.

This phase of the war soon acquired the name &quot;Eelam War II&quot;, and featured unprecedented brutality. On 11 June 1990 the LTTE massacred 600 policemen in the Eastern Province after they had surrendered on promises of safe-conduct. The government placed an embargo on food and medicine entering the Jaffna peninsula and the air force relentlessly bombed the north. In the second half of 1990, 4500 Tamils were killed or disappeared by security forces in Batticaloa and Amparai District alone. The LTTE responded by attacking Sinhalese and Muslim villages and massacring civilians. One of the largest civilian massacres of the war occurred when the LTTE massacred 166 Muslim civilians at Palliyagodella. The government trained and armed Home Guard Muslim units.

Notable international jurist Neelan Thiruchelvam, in a speech at the ICES-Colombo, indicated that the appropriate investigations into and disappearances of civilians including many children in the Sathurukondan, Eastern University, Mylanthanai and the mass murder and burial of school children at Sooriyakanda were hampered by the adoption of emergency regulations which contributed to a climate of impunity. Along roadsides in the north and east, burning bodies became a common sight. Throughout the country, government death squads hunted down, kidnapped or killed Sinhalese or Tamil youth suspected of sympathizing with the JVP or the LTTE, respectively. In October 1990 the LTTE expelled all the Muslims residing in Northern province. A total of 72,000 Muslims were forced to leave their homes, taking nothing but the clothes on their backs.

The largest battle of the war took place in July 1991, when 5,000 LTTE fighters surrounded the army&#x27;s Elephant Pass base, which controlled access to the Jaffna Peninsula. More than 2,000 died on both sides in the month-long siege, before 10,000 government troops arrived to relieve the base.
In February 1992 another series of government offensives failed to capture Jaffna. Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa together with Maj. Gen. Vijaya Wimalaratne and Rear Adm. Mohan Jayamaha, died on 8 August 1992 at Araly (Aeraella) point Jaffna due to a land mine blast. Their deaths badly affected military morale. The LTTE also scored a major victory when one of its suicide bombers killed Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in May 1993. In November 1993 the LTTE defeated the army in the Battle of Pooneryn. This attack left 532 Sri Lankan soldiers and 135 sailors either dead or missing in action.

===Eelam War III (1995–2002)===
In the 1994 parliamentary elections the UNP was defeated and the People&#x27;s Alliance, headed by Chandrika Kumaratunga, came to power on a peace platform. During the Presidential election campaign an LTTE bomb attack was carried out during a rally held at Thotalanga, Grandpass, eliminating the entire leadership of UNP, including its presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake. Kumaratunga became the president with a 62% majority. A cease-fire was agreed to in January 1995, but the ensuing negotiations proved fruitless. The LTTE broke the cease-fire and blew up two gunboats, SLNS &quot;Sooraya&quot; and SLNS &quot;Ranasuru&quot; of the Sri Lanka Navy on 19 April, thereby beginning the next phase of the war, dubbed &quot;Eelam War III&quot;.

The new government then pursued a policy of &quot;war for peace&quot;. Determined to retake the key rebel stronghold of Jaffna, which was occupied by 2,000 rebels, it poured troops into the peninsula in the successful Operation Riviresa. In one particular incident in August 1995, Air Force jets bombed St. Peter&#x27;s church at Navali (Naavaella), killing at least 65 refugees and wounding 150 others. In another instance in the same year, over 40 people were massacred in Nagerkovil and more civilian massacres followed in subsequent years, such as the Kumarapuram massacre, Tampalakamam massacre, Puthukkudiyiruppu massacre, etc., all of them carried out by government forces. Government troops initially cut off the peninsula from the rest of the island, and then, after seven weeks of heavy fighting, succeeded in bringing Jaffna under government control for the first time in nearly a decade. In a high-profile ceremony, Sri Lankan Defense Minister Col. Anuruddha Ratwatte raised the national flag inside the Jaffna Fort on 5 December 1995. The government estimated that approximately 2500 soldiers and rebels were killed in the offensive, and an estimated 7,000 wounded. Many civilians were killed in this conflict, such as the Navaly church bombing in which over 125 civilians died. The LTTE and more than 350,000 civilians, compelled by SL military operations and LTTE pressure to leave Jaffna, fled to the Vanni region in the interior. Most of the refugees returned later the next year.

The LTTE responded by launching Operation Unceasing Waves and decisively won the Battle of Mullaitivu on 18 July 1996, leaving 1,173 army troops dead which included 207 officers and men executed after surrendering to the LTTE. The government launched another offensive in August 1996. Another 200,000 civilians fled the violence. The town of Kilinochchi was taken on 29 September. On 13 May 1997, 20,000 government troops tried to open a supply line through the LTTE-controlled Vanni, but failed.

As violence continued in the North, LTTE suicide and time bombs were exploded numerous times in populated city areas and public transport in the south of the country, killing hundreds of civilians. In January 1996 the LTTE carried out one of its deadliest suicide bomb attacks at the Central Bank in Colombo, killing 90 and injuring 1,400. In October 1997 it bombed the Sri Lankan World Trade Centre and, in January 1998, detonated a truck bomb in Kandy, damaging the Temple of the Tooth, one of the holiest Buddhist shrines in the world. In response to this bombing, the Sri Lankan government outlawed the LTTE and with some success pressed other governments around the world to do the same, significantly interfering with the group&#x27;s fund-raising activities.

In January 1997 heavy fighting around Paranthan and the Elephant Pass complex took the lives of 223 Army troops. On 27 September 1998 the LTTE launched Operation Unceasing Waves II and, after heavy fighting, captured Kilinochchi, winning the Battle of Kilinochchi. Clashes around the Kilinochchi forward defense line claimed the lives of 1206 soldiers that year. In March 1999, in Operation Rana Gosa, the government tried invading the Vanni from the south.The army made some gains, taking control of Oddusuddan (Oththan-thuduva) and Madhu, but could not dislodge the LTTE from the region. In September 1999 the LTTE massacred 50 Sinhalese civilians at Gonagala.

The LTTE returned to the offensive with Operation Unceasing Waves III on 2 November 1999. Nearly all the Vanni rapidly fell back into LTTE hands. The group launched 17 successful attacks in the region, culminating in the overrunning of the Paranthan (Puranthaenna) Chemicals Factory base and the Kurrakkan Kaddukulam (kurakkan-kaela vaeva) base. The death toll amounted to 516 soldiers dead and over 4,000 injured. The rebels also advanced north towards Elephant Pass and Jaffna. The LTTE was successful in cutting all land and sea supply lines of the Sri Lankan armed forces to the south, west and north of the town of Kilinochchi. In December 1999 the LTTE attempted to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a suicide attack at a pre-election rally. She lost her right-eye, among other injuries, but was able to defeat opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in the Presidential election and was re-elected to her second term in office.

On 22 April 2000 the Elephant Pass military complex, which had separated the Jaffna peninsula from the Vanni mainland for 17 years, fell into the hands of the LTTE, leaving 1,008 soldiers dead. The army then launched Operation Agni Kheela to take back the southern Jaffna Peninsula, but sustained losses.

====Early peace efforts====
Exhaustion with the war was building as casualties mounted and there appeared to be no end in sight. By mid-2000 human rights groups estimated that more than one million people in Sri Lanka were internally displaced persons, living in camps, homeless and struggling for survival. As a result, a significant peace movement developed in the late 1990s, with many organizations holding peace camps, conferences, training and peace meditations, and many other efforts to bridge the two sides at all levels. As early as February 2000 Norway was asked to mediate by both sides, and initial international diplomatic moves began to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

Hopes for peace gained ground as the LTTE declared a unilateral cease-fire in December 2000, but they cancelled it on 24 April 2001 and launched another offensive against the government. After securing a vast area formerly controlled by the military, the LTTE further advanced northwards. This advancement posed a serious threat to the Elephant Pass military complex that housed 17,000 Sri Lankan troops.

In July 2001 the LTTE carried out a devastating suicide attack on Bandaranaike International Airport, destroying eight of the air force&#x27;s planes (two IAI Kfirs, one Mil-17, one Mil-24, three K-8 trainers, one MiG-27) and four Sri Lankan Airlines planes (two Airbus A330s, one A340 and one A320), dampening the economy and causing tourisma vital foreign exchange earner for the governmentto plummet. The impact of the attack was so devastating that in that year the Sri Lankan economy recorded a negative growth for the first and only time since its independence.

===2002 peace process (2002–2006)===

====Beginning of the cease-fire====
Towards the end of 2001 however, the LTTE began to declare their willingness to explore measures for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. One reason for this action may have been the fear of international pressure and the direct US support of the Sri Lankan government as part of the &quot;war on terror&quot;. On the other hand, the covert operations of the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) of Sri Lanka army had a profound impact on the Tiger command structure. During this period, Vaithilingam Sornalingam &quot;alias&quot; Shankar, who had been considered the right-hand man of LTTE leader Prabhakaran, and several other high-profile leaders were hunted down and killed by LRRP units.

In the south the government was facing increasing criticism over its &quot;war for peace&quot; strategy, with peace nowhere in sight and the economy in tatters. After losing a no-confidence motion, President Kumaratunga was forced to dissolve parliament and call for fresh elections. The elections, held on 5 December 2001, saw a sweeping victory for the United National Front, led by Ranil Wickremasinghe, who campaigned on a pro-peace platform and pledged to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

On 19 December, amidst efforts by Norway to bring the government and the Tamil Tigers to the negotiating table, the LTTE announced a 30-day cease-fire with the Sri Lankan government and pledged to halt all attacks against government forces. The new government welcomed the move, and reciprocated it two days later, announcing a month-long cease-fire and agreeing to lift a long-standing economic embargo on rebel-held territory.

The cease-fire was by no means acceptable to everyone. Buddhist monks started burning Norwegian flags and agitated against the cease-fire and eventually went to form a political party, Jathika Hela Urumaya, with extremist views.

====Signing of Memorandum of Understanding====
The two sides formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 22 February 2002, and signed a permanent cease-fire agreement (CFA). Norway was named mediator, and it was decided that they, together with the other Nordic countries, monitor the cease-fire through a committee of experts named the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. In August the government agreed to lift the ban on the LTTE and paved the way for the resumption of direct negotiations with them.
Following the signing of the ceasefire agreement, commercial air flights to Jaffna began and the LTTE opened the key A9 highway, which linked the government-controlled area in the south with Jaffna and ran through LTTE territory, allowing civilian traffic through the Vanni region for the first time in many years (but only after paying a tax to the LTTE). Many foreign countries also offered substantial financial support if peace was achieved and optimism grew that an end to the decades-long conflict was in sight.

The much-anticipated peace talks began in Phuket, Thailand, and further rounds followed in Thailand, Norway, Germany and Japan. During the talks both sides agreed to the principle of a federal solution and the Tigers dropped their long-standing demand for a separate state. This was a major compromise on the part of the LTTE, which had always insisted on an independent Tamil state. This also represented a compromise on the part of the government, which had seldom agreed to more than minimal devolution. Both sides also exchanged prisoners of war for the first time.

====Political changes in the South====
Following the elections of 2001, for the first time in Sri Lanka&#x27;s history the President and Prime Minister were of two different parties. This co-habitation was uneasy, especially since Prime Minister Wickremasinghe and the UNP favored a federal solution to the conflict, while hard-line elements within President Kumaratunga&#x27;s party and other Sinhala nationalist groups allied to her opposed one, as they did not trust the LTTE, which continued to levy taxes, strengthen itself by smuggling in arms and ammunition, recruit child soldiers and engage in killings of members of rival Tamil groups and government intelligence agents following the Millennium City incident. During this time the LTTE also succeeded in setting up a series of vital bases around the Trincomalee Harbour (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Manirasakulam camp) and the Eastern Province.

The talks broke down on 21 April 2003 when the Tamil Tigers announced they were suspending any further talks due to their &quot;displeasure&quot; at the handling of some &quot;critical issues&quot;. Among the reasons the Tigers gave were their exclusion from reconstruction talks in Washington, DC, on 14 April and a more general insinuation that they were not receiving the full economic rewards of peace. They cited the failure, as they saw it, of peace dividends to transfer to security withdrawals on the ground and the disparity, as they saw it, between the relative calm of the government-held northeast and continuing violence in Tiger-held areas. However, the LTTE maintained it was committed to a settlement to the two-decade conflict, but stated that progress had to be made on the ground before the settlement proceeded.

On 31 October the LTTE issued its own peace proposal, calling for an &quot;Interim Self Governing Authority&quot; (ISGA). The ISGA would be fully controlled by the LTTE and would have broad powers in the north and east (see the full text of the proposals) This provoked a strong backlash among the hard-line elements in the south, who accused Prime Minister Wickremasinghe of handing the north and east to the LTTE. Under pressure from within her own party to take action, Kumaratunga declared a state of emergency and took three key government ministries, the Ministry of Mass Media, the Interior Ministry and the crucial Defense Ministry. She then formed an alliance with the JVP, called the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance, opposed to the ISGA and advocating a harder line on the LTTE, and called for fresh elections. The elections, held on 8 April 2004, resulted in victory for the UPFA with Mahinda Rajapakse appointed as Prime Minister.

====Split of the LTTE====
Meanwhile, in March 2004 there had been a major split between the northern and eastern wings of the LTTE. Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan &quot;alias&quot; Col. Karuna, the Eastern commander of the LTTE and one of Prabhakaran&#x27;s trusted lieutenants, pulled 5,000 eastern cadres out of the LTTE, claiming insufficient resources and power were being given to Tamils of the eastern part of the island. It was the biggest expression of dissension in the history of the LTTE and a clash within the LTTE seemed imminent. After the parliamentary elections, brief fighting south of Trincomalee led to a rapid retreat and capitulation of Karuna&#x27;s group, their leaders eventually going into hiding including Karuna himself, who was helped to escape by Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana, a politician from the ruling party. However, the &quot;Karuna faction&quot; maintained a significant presence in the east and continued to launch attacks against the LTTE. The LTTE accused the army of covertly backing the breakaway group, which subsequently formed a political party named the TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) and hope to contest in future elections.

The cease-fire largely held through all this turmoil, with over 3000 infractions by the LTTE and some 300 by the SLA recorded by the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) by 2005. The situation was further complicated by allegations that both sides were carrying out covert operations against each other. The government claimed that the LTTE was killing political opponents, recruiting children, importing arms and killing government security and intelligence officers. The rebels accused the government of supporting paramilitary groups against them, especially the Karuna group.

====Tsunami and aftermath====
On 26 December 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami struck Sri Lanka, killing more than 35,000 people and leaving many more homeless. A great deal of aid arrived from around the world, but there was immediate disagreement over how it should be distributed to the Tamil regions under LTTE control. By 24 June the government and LTTE agreed on the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure (P-TOMS), but it received sharp criticism from the JVP, who left the government in protest. The legality of P-TOMS was also challenged in the courts. President Kumaratunga eventually had to scrap P-TOMS, which led to widespread criticism that sufficient aid was not reaching the north and east of the country. However, immediately following the tsunami there was a marked decrease in violence in the north.

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, a Tamil who was highly respected by foreign diplomats and who had been sharply critical of the LTTE, was assassinated at his home on 12 August 2005, allegedly by a LTTE sniper. His assassination led to the marginalization of the LTTE in the international community, and is generally considered to be the moment when the LTTE lost much of the sympathy in the eyes of foreign nations. The result was silence of the international community when the Sri Lankan government took military action against the LTTE in 2006, when the latter closed the Mavil aru sluice.

Further political change occurred when the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka declared President Kumaratunga&#x27;s second and final term over and ordered her to hold fresh presidential elections. The main candidates for the election, which was held in November, were UNF candidate former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, who advocated the reopening of talks with the LTTE, and the UPFA candidate Prime Minister Rajapaksa, who called for a tougher line against the LTTE and a renegotiation of the cease-fire. The LTTE openly called for a boycott of the election by Tamils. Many of them were expected to vote for Wickremasinghe, and the loss of their votes proved fatal to his chances, as Rajapakse achieved a narrow victory. Following the election, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran stated in his annual address that the Tigers would &quot;renew their struggle&quot; in 2006 if the government did not take serious moves toward peace.

===Eelam War IV (2006–2009)===

Beginning in December 2005, there was increased guerrilla activity to the northeast, including Claymore mine attacks which killed 150 government troops, clashes between the Sea Tigers and the Sri Lanka navy and the killings of sympathizers on both sides including Taraki Sivaram, a pro-LTTE journalist, and Joseph Pararajasingham, a pro-LTTE MP, both killed allegedly by the government of Sri Lanka.

At the beginning of 2006 the focus of the civil war turned to civilian targets, with commuter bus and train bombings carried out by LTTE in most parts of the country, including a series of attacks against commuters in and around Colombo.

====Talks and further violence====
In light of this violence, the co-chairs of the Tokyo Donor conference called on both parties to return to the negotiating table. US State Department officials gave warnings to the Tigers, stating that a return to hostilities would mean that the Tigers would face a &quot;more capable and more determined&quot; Sri Lankan military. While the talks were going on there was violence directed towards civilians, such as the killings of five Tamil students on 2 January 2006.

In a last-minute effort to salvage an agreement between the parties, Norwegian special envoy Erik Solheim and LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham arrived on the island. The parties strongly disagreed on the location of the talks; however, continued efforts produced a breakthrough when both parties agreed on 7 February 2006 that new talks could be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 22 and 23 February. During the weeks after the talks there was a significant decrease in violence. However, the LTTE resumed attacks against the military in April.

In light of this violence, the LTTE called for a postponement of the Geneva talks until 24–25 April, and the government initially agreed to this. Following negotiations, both the government and the rebels agreed to have a civilian vessel transport regional LTTE leaders with international truce monitors on 16 April, which involved crossing government-controlled territory. However, the climate shifted drastically when the Tigers cancelled the meeting, claiming not to have agreed to a naval escort. According to the SLMM, the Tamil rebels had previously agreed to the escort.

On 20 April 2006 the LTTE officially pulled out of peace talks indefinitely. While they stated that transportation issues had prevented them from meeting their regional leaders, some analysts and the international community were strongly skeptical, seeing the transportation issue as a delaying tactic by the LTTE to avoid attending peace talks in Geneva. Violence continued to spiral and on 23 April 2006, six Sinhalese rice farmers were massacred in their paddy fields by suspected LTTE cadres, and on 13 May 2006 13 Tamil civilians were killed in the islet of Kayts. International condemnation against the LTTE skyrocketed following the attempted assassination of the commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka, by a female LTTE Black Tiger suicide bomber named Anoja Kugenthirasah, who concealed the explosives by appearing to be pregnant and blew herself up at army headquarters in Colombo. For the first time since the 2001 cease-fire, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out aerial assaults on rebel positions in the northeastern part of the island in retaliation for the attack.

This attack, along with the assassination of Lakshman Kadiragamar a year earlier and an unsuccessful attack against a naval vessel carrying 710 unarmed security force personnel on holiday, marked a turning point, as the European Union decided to proscribe the LTTE as a terrorist organisation on 19 May 2006. It resulted in the freezing of LTTE assets in its 27 member nations. In a statement, the European Parliament said that the LTTE did not represent all the Tamils and called on it to &quot;allow for political pluralism and alternate democratic voices in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka&quot;. As the north and east of the country continued to be rocked by attacks, new talks were scheduled in Oslo, Norway, between 8–9 June. Delegations from both sides arrived in Oslo, but the talks were cancelled when the LTTE refused to meet directly with the government delegation, claiming its fighters were not allowed safe passage to travel to the talks. Norwegian mediator Erik Solheim told journalists that the LTTE should take direct responsibility for the collapse of the talks.

Further violence followed, including the Vankalai massacre. The Sri Lankan army and Tamil Tiger rebels blamed each other for the killings. There was also the Kebithigollewa massacre in which the LTTE attacked a bus, killing at least 64 Sinhalese civilians and prompting more air strikes by the Air Force, and the assassination of Sri Lanka&#x27;s third highest-ranking army officer and Deputy Chief of Staff General Parami Kulatunga on 26 June by an LTTE suicide bomber. These events led the SLMM to question whether a cease-fire could still be said to exist.

====Mavil Aru water dispute====
A new crisis leading to the first large-scale fighting since signing of the cease-fire occurred when the LTTE closed the sluice gates of the Mavil Aru reservoir on 21 July. Mavil Aru was the waterway that provided water to some regions of eastern Sri Lanka, like Trincomalee. After the cease-fire in 2002, the conflict over Mavil Aru was one of the biggest military confrontations between the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and the LTTE. Its relevance is for geo-strategic reasons: within the Mavil Aru area, Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil populations live side by side. It is also the entrance to Koddiyar Bay, the inlet for Trincomalee port and naval base, so the LTTE presence in the area seriously threatened the Sri Lankan security forces&#x27; presence and domination.

Closure of Mavil Aru affected the water supply to 15,000 families in government-controlled areas. After the initial negotiations and efforts by the SLMM to open the gates failed, the Sri Lanka military initiated an operation to achieve the re-opening of the sluice gates.

President Rajapaksa said that the supply of water was a non-negotiable fundamental human right. Additionally, a government spokesman said that &quot;utilities could not be used as bargaining tools&quot; by the rebels. The government deployed its army and air force for the offensive, attacking not only the region of Mavil Aru but also the LTTE positions in Batticaloa, and Vavuniya. Air Force planes attacked LTTE positions on 26 July, and ground troops began an operation to open the gate. The sluice gates were eventually reopened on 8 August, with conflicting reports as to who actually opened them. Initially, the SLMM claimed that they managed to persuade the LTTE to lift the waterway blockade conditionally. The LTTE claimed that it opened the sluice gates &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot;, although this was disputed by military correspondents, who stated the water began flowing immediately after security forces carried out a precise bombing of the Mavil Aru anicut. Eventually, following heavy fighting, government troops gained full control of the Mavil Aru reservoir on 15 August. The consequences of the &quot;Operation Watershed&quot; were about 150 civilians killed and more than 50,000 refugees from Mutur and the villages nearby. It was the precedent of the Eelam War IV.

====LTTE offensives in Muttur and Jaffna====
As fierce fighting was ongoing in the vicinity of Mavil Aru, violence spread to Trincomalee, where the LTTE launched an attack on a crucial Sri Lanka Navy base, and to the strategic government-controlled coastal town of Muttur in early August, resulting in the deaths of at least 30 civilians and displacing 25,000 residents of the area. The clashes erupted on 2 August 2006 when the LTTE launched a heavy artillery attack on Muttur and then moved in, gaining control of some parts of the town. The military retaliated, and re-established full control over the town by 5 August, killing over 150 LTTE fighters in heavy clashes.

Soon afterwards, 17 persons working for the International French charity Action Against Hunger (ACF) in Muthur, were massacred. They were found lying face down on the floor of their office, shot to death, still wearing their clearly marked T-shirts indicating they were international humanitarian workers. The murders prompted widespread international condemnation. The SLMM claimed that the government was behind the attack, but the government denied the allegation calling it &quot;pathetic and biased&quot;, and stated that the SLMM had &quot;no right to make such a statement because they are not professionals in autopsy or post-mortem.&quot;

Meanwhile, in the north of the country, some of the bloodiest fighting since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on Sri Lanka Army defence lines on the Jaffna Peninsula on 11 August. The LTTE used a force of 400–500 fighters in the attacks, which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at Palaly. The LTTE is estimated to have lost over 200 fighters in the operation, while 90 Sri Lankan soldiers and sailors were also killed.

As ground battles were ongoing in the north and the east of the country, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out an air strike against a facility in the rebel-held Mullaitivu area, killing a number of Tamil girls. Although the LTTE claimed 61 girls were killed, the SLMM stated they were able to count just 19 bodies. The government stated that it was an LTTE training facility and that the children were LTTE child soldiers, although the LTTE claimed the victims were schoolgirls attending a course on first aid at an orphanage.

On the same day a convoy carrying the Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Bashir Wali Mohamed, was attacked when a claymore antipersonnel mine concealed within an auto rickshaw blew up as it passed by. The High Commissioner escaped unhurt, but seven people were killed and 17 injured in the blast. The High Commissioner claimed that India was believed to have carried it out, in order to intimidate Pakistan, which is one of the main suppliers of military equipment to the Sri Lankan government. Pakistan had promised one shipload of equipment every 10 days in coming months.

====Fall of Sampur====
Since the resumption of violence, concerns were mounting among the military establishment that the strategically crucial Sri Lanka Navy base in Trincomalee was under severe threat from LTTE gun positions located in and around Sampur, which lies across the Koddiyar Bay from Trincomalee. Artillery fired from LTTE bases in the area could potentially cripple the naval base, bringing it to a complete standstill and cutting the only military supply chain to Jaffna. All movements of naval vessels were also under the constant surveillance of the LTTE. These fears were backed up by a US military advisory team which visited the island in 2005.

Following clashes in Mavil Aru and Muttur, the LTTE had intensified attacks targeting the naval base in Trincomalee, and in a speech on 21 August Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse made clear the government intentions were to neutralize the LTTE threat from Sampur. On 28 August the military launched an assault to retake the LTTE camps in Sampur and the adjoining Kaddaiparichchan and Thoppur areas. This led the LTTE to declare that if the offensive continued, the cease-fire would be officially over.

After steady progress, security forces led by Brigade Commander Sarath Wijesinghe recaptured Sampur from the LTTE on 4 September and began to establish military bases there, as the LTTE admitted defeat and stated their fighters &quot;withdrew&quot; from the strategically important town. It marked the first significant territorial change of hands since the signing of the cease-fire agreement in 2002. The Sri Lankan military estimated that 33 of its personnel were killed in the offensive, along with over 200 LTTE fighters.

====LTTE retaliation and further peace talks====
The LTTE struck back in October. First, they killed nearly 130 soldiers in a fierce battle at Muhamalai, the crossing-point between government- and LTTE-controlled area in the north of the country. Just days later, a suspected LTTE suicide bomber struck a naval convoy in Habarana, in the center of the country, killing about 100 sailors who were returning home on leave. It was the deadliest suicide attack in the history of the conflict.

Two days later LTTE Sea Tiger forces launched an attack against the &quot;Dakshina&quot; naval base in the southern port city of Galle. It was the farthest south any major LTTE attack had taken place, and involved 15 LTTE fighters who arrived in five suicide boats. The attack was repulsed by the government, and the damage to the naval base was minimal. All 15 LTTE fighters were believed to have died in the attack, along with one Navy sailor.

Despite these incidents, both parties agreed to unconditionally attend peace talks in Geneva on 28–29 October. However, the peace talks broke down due to disagreements over the reopening of the key A9 highway, which is the link between Jaffna and government-controlled areas in the south. While the LTTE wanted the highway, which was closed following fierce battles in August, to be reopened, the government refused, stating the LTTE would use it to collect taxes from people passing through and would use it to launch further offensives against government troops.

Following the dawn of the new year, suspected LTTE fighters carried out two bus bombings in the south of the country, killing 21 civilians. News reports stated that the attacks bore all the hallmarks of an LTTE attack. The Sri Lankan government condemned the attacks and blamed the LTTE for carrying them out, although the LTTE denied any involvement.

====Government offensive in the East====

In December 2006 Sri Lankan government officials announced their plans to drive the LTTE out of the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka, and then use the full strength of the military to defeat the LTTE in the north of the country. The government stated that LTTE was firing artillery towards civilian settlements in the east and were using 35,000 people as human shields. These claims were later backed up by civilians in the area, who told reporters that they were held by force by the Tamil Tigers. On 7 November 2006, amidst conflicting claims, over 45 Tamil civilians were killed in what is known as the Vaharai bombing.

Subsequently, the army began an offensive against the LTTE on 8 December 2006, in the Batticoloa District with the objective of taking Vakarai, the principal stronghold of the LTTE in the east; the operation was temporarily aborted after a week of fighting due to the large number of civilians in the area and the difficulty in conducting combat operations due to the ongoing monsoon rain. Over the next few weeks an estimated 20,000 civilians fled from to government-controlled areas, fearing the imminent assault. The army launched a new offensive in mid-January, and Vakarai fell to the advancing troops on 19 January. While the offensive in the East was ongoing, the LTTE and others accused the government of murdering 15 civilians in the Padahuthurai bombing on 2 January, when the air force bombed what they claimed to be an LTTE naval base in Illuppaikadavai in northern Sri Lanka. The loss of Vakarai had been predicted to cut off supply routes of the northern Tigers to their cadres in the east, thus weakening the Tigers&#x27; already diminishing grip on the east.

As the military offensive was ongoing, the LTTE continued to carry out attacks against civilians in government-held territory. On 1 April 2007 the military accused the LTTE of killing six Sinhalese tsunami aid workers in the eastern district of Batticaloa.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh-4/2/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;toi-4/2/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The next day suspected LTTE fighters set off a bomb aboard a civilian bus in Ampara, which killed 17 people, including three children.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-4/2/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bus-4/2/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops mostly operating in small groups of Special Forces and Commando units began a new operation in February to clear the last remaining LTTE fighters from the Eastern Province. As part of the operation, troops captured the key LTTE base in Kokkadicholai on 28 March, and the strategic A5 highway on 12 April, bringing the entire highway under government control for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-a5-4/12/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This meant the LTTE&#x27;s presence in the east was reduced to a 140-square-kilometre pocket of jungle in the Thoppigala area northwest of Batticaloa.&lt;ref name=&quot;ra-4/12/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the three-month-long Battle of Thoppigala, the army captured the Thoppigala peak on 11 July 2007, ending the LTTE&#x27;s military capability in the Eastern Province and concluding Eelam War IV in the Eastern theatre.

====Government offensive in the North====
Sporadic fighting in the North had been going on for months, but the intensity of the clashes increased after September 2007. During clashes in the Forward Defence Lines, separating their forces, both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire, after which military incursions followed. By December 2007, the LTTE defences at Uyilankulama, Parappakandal and Thampanai were lost to advancing troops of the Sri Lanka Army.

In an interview with the &quot;Sunday Observer&quot; the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said that the Army had occupied the LTTE&#x27;s Forward Defence Lines and surrounded the Wanni LTTE bases from all directions. He also said that there were around 3,000 Tigers remaining and that the military intended to annihilate them within the first six months of the next year. A day later there were less optimistic statements by Army, Air Force and Navy Commanders. The Army was to face an estimated 5,000 Tiger cadres in the Wanni. The Commander of the Army intended to shift the current battles in the Forward Defence Lines to a decisive phase in August 2008. In the Commanders&#x27; view, it was quite possible to defeat the LTTE in 2008.

The military of Sri Lanka claimed that the leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran, was seriously injured during air strikes carried out by the Sri Lanka Air Force on a bunker complex in Jayanthinagar on 26 November 2007. Earlier, on 2 November 2007, S. P. Thamilselvan, the head of the LTTE political wing, was killed during another government air raid. The Sri Lanka Air Force openly vowed to destroy the entire leadership of the LTTE. On 5 January 2008, Colonel Charles, Head of LTTE Military Intelligence, was killed in a claymore mine ambush by a Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka) (LRRP).

====Abrogation of ceasefire agreement====
Defense secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa urged the government to abandon the ceasefire agreement in December 2007, and on 2 January 2008, the Sri Lankan government officially did so. Between February 2002 to May 2007, Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission had documented 3,830 ceasefire violations by the LTTE versus 351 by the security forces. From May 2007, the SLMM ceased making determinations on ceasefire violations. Thus the government stated there was no need for a ceasefire any more. Several donor countries expressed their disappointment at the Sri Lankan government&#x27;s withdrawal. The LTTE formally responded that since the government had unilaterally withdrawn from the ceasefire agreement without any justification and that they were prepared to continue to honour the agreement, the international community ought to immediately remove the bans it had placed on the LTTE.

The government then attempted to open a third front along the Muhamalai Forward Defence Line. After an initial setback on 23 April, the Sri Lankan Army advanced rapidly, capturing the town of Adampan on 9 May,&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-ma-05/09/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mannar &quot;Rice Bowl&quot; which consists of the island&#x27;s most fertile paddy fields on 30 June, Vidattaltivu on 16 July, and Iluppaikkadavai on 20 July.

On 21 July 2008, the LTTE announced that it would be declaring a unilateral ceasefire from 28 July to 4 August, to coincide with the 15th summit of the heads of state of SAARC to be held in Colombo. However, the government of Sri Lanka dismissed the LTTE&#x27;s offer as needless and treacherous.

====Significant military gains by the government====
On 2 August 2008, Vellankulam town, the LTTE&#x27;s last stronghold in Mannar District, fell to the advancing SLA troops, completing the eight-month effort to recapture the district.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-ma-08/02/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Army followed this up by taking control of Mallavi on 2 September, following weeks of heavy military confrontation.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-ma-09/02/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE countered with a surprise attack on the Vavuniya air base on 9 September, in which both sides claimed victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-09/10/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From Mannar, the Army had entered Kilinochchi District, the last stronghold of the LTTE, at the end of July, with the intention of taking Kilinochchi before the end of the year. On 3 October 2008, a UN aid convoy managed to unload all its cargo in Kilinochchi District and described Kilinochchi town as having been nearly abandoned,&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-10/03/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the LTTE were able to kill retired Major General Janaka Perera along with 26 other victims in a suicide blast on 6 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-10/06/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2008, SLA troops cut off the Mannar-Poonaryn A32 highway north of Nachchikuda, the main remaining Sea Tiger stronghold on the northwestern coast of the island, thus effectively encircling it. They began their assault on 28 October and captured it the next day. After that the Army Task Force 1 continued their advance towards Pooneryn and captured Kiranchchi, Palavi, Veravil, Valaipadu and Devil&#x27;s Point. On 15 November 2008, troops of the Army Task Force 1 entered the strategically important Tiger stronghold of Pooneryn. Simultaneously, the newly created Army Task Force 3 was introduced into the area of Mankulam with the objective of engaging the LTTE cadres in a new battlefront towards the east of the Jaffna–Kandy A9 highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-mu-11/03/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SLA troops captured Mankulam and the surrounding area on 17 November 2008.

Meanwhile, the situation of more than 200,000 civilians who had been displaced in the latest round of fighting was turning into a humanitarian disaster; however, due to a number of reasons including doubts regarding the sincerity of the LTTE&#x27;s negotiations, neither Western governments nor India intervened to broker a new ceasefire.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-10/17/08-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fall of Kilinochchi and subsequent events====
The Sri Lankan Army began the attack on Kilinochchi on 23 November 2008. Troops were attacking rebels&#x27; defences from three directions. However, the LTTE offered a stiff resistance, and the prolonged attack resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.
Not until 1 January 2009 were SLA troops able to capture Paranthan, located to the north of Kilinochchi along the A-9 route. This isolated the southern periphery of the Elephant Pass LTTE foothold and also exposed the LTTE&#x27;s main fortification at Kilinochchi. This made the capture of Kilinochchi, which the rebels had used for over a decade as their de facto administrative capital, far simpler, and they were able to accomplish this on 2 January. The loss of Killinochchi caused a substantial dent in the LTTE&#x27;s image as a capable, ruthless rebel group, and observers forecast the LTTE was likely to collapse before long under unbearable military pressure on multiple fronts.

The Tigers quickly abandoned their positions on the Jaffna peninsula to make a last stand in the jungles of Mullaitivu, their last main base.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-01/08/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Jaffna peninsula was captured by the Sri Lanka Army by 14 January 2009. However, they were unable to hold out for long, and on 25 January, SLA troops captured Mullaitivu.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes 2009/01/26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The last Sea Tiger base in Chalai was next to fall on 5 February, reducing the territory under rebel control to less than some 200 km2.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-mu-02/05/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This stage of the war was marked by increased brutality against civilians and rapidly mounting civilian casualties. On 19 February 2009, Human Rights Watch issued a report accusing the Sri Lankan army of &quot;slaughtering&quot; the civilians during indiscriminate artillery attacks (including repeated shelling of hospitals) and calling on the Sri Lankan government to end its policy of &quot;detaining displaced persons&quot; in military-controlled internment camps. Human Rights Watch also urged the Tamil Tigers to permit trapped civilians to leave the war zone and to &quot;stop shooting at those who try to flee&quot;. The UN was also concerned over the condition of internally displaced persons and estimated that some 200,000 people were being squeezed into a narrow 14 square kilometre patch of land on the coast in Vanni, which the government had declared the &#x27;no-fire zone&#x27;.

On 20 February 2009, two LTTE planes on a suicide mission carried out a kamikaze style air attack on the Sri Lankan commercial capital Colombo, killing 2 and wounding 45, but both planes were shot down by the Sri Lankan Air Force before they could damage the intended targets which were the Army Headquarters and the main Air Force base. By late March, the Tamil Tigers controlled only one square kilometre outside the no-fire zone, down from about 15,000 km2 a mere three years earlier. Political pressure was placed on President Rajapaksa to find a political solution to the conflict and he called for a meeting with Tamil National Alliance, but they refused until the government resolved the humanitarian crisis faced by civilians trapped in the fighting.

The Battle of Aanandapuram, which was described by military analyst/journalist D. B. S. Jeyaraj as the &quot;defining moment&quot; of the 3 decade war, was fought on 5 April. This battle saw the demise of most of the battle-hardened ground commanders of the LTTE, including Velayuthapillai Baheerathakumar &quot;alias&quot; Theepan, the overall commander of the LTTE northern front fighting formations. SLA soldiers numbering more than 50,000 from 5 divisions participated in the battle encircling the LTTE cadres inside a small littoral strip of territory located between the Paranthan-Mullaitivu A35 highway, Nanthikadal and Chalai Lagoons on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other. Rebel casualties amounted to 625.

====Fighting in the &#x27;No-Fire Zone&#x27;====
SLA troops were able to push the Tamil Tigers into the no-fire zone set up for civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-mu-04/05/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE then built a long bund in the no-fire zone, trapping over 30,000 civilians, but the SLA was able to destroy this.

On 21 April, Sri Lankan troops launched an assault, targeting LTTE leader, Vellupillai Prabhakaran. At the same time, a mass Tamil exodus from the &#x27;no-fire zone&#x27; was underway. The next day, two senior LTTE members (LTTE media co-ordinator Velayuthan Thayanithi, &quot;alias&quot; Daya Master, and a top interpreter Kumar Pancharathnam, &quot;alias&quot; George) surrendered to the advancing Sri Lankan army. This came as &quot;a rude shock&quot; and a major setback for the rebel leadership. When asked why they had surrendered, both men stressed that rebels were shooting at the civilians and preventing them from escaping from the &#x27;no-fire zone&#x27; to safety in government-controlled areas. They also alleged that the LTTE were still abducting and conscripting children as young as 14 years old, and would fire at anyone who tried to resist.

By 25 April, the area under the LTTE was reduced to 10 km2. While the Tamil exodus from the &#x27;no-fire zone&#x27; continued, the UN estimated that around 6,500 civilians may have been killed and another 14,000 wounded between January 2009 and April 2009. The BBC reported that the land recaptured by the army from the rebels was totally depopulated and utterly devastated.

As fighting continued, a group of independent United Nations experts called on the Human Rights Council to urgently set up an international inquiry to address the &quot;critical&quot; situation in Sri Lanka amid fighting between the Army and Tamil rebels. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), over 196,000 people fled the conflict zone, a shrinking pocket of land on the north-east coastline, where clashes continued between government troops and the LTTE, while at least 50,000 people were still trapped there. A UN spokesman in Colombo, Gordon Weiss, said more than 100 children died during the &quot;large-scale killing of civilians&quot; and described the situation in northern Sri Lanka as a &quot;bloodbath&quot;. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was appalled at the killing of hundreds of Sri Lankan civilians caught in the middle of hostilities between the army and separatist Tamil rebels over the weekend. He voiced deep concern over the continued use of heavy weapons in the conflict zone, but also stressed that the &quot;reckless disrespect shown by the LTTE for the safety of civilians has led to thousands of people remaining trapped in the area&quot;.

On 13 May, the UN Security Council issued the following press statement, &quot;The members of the Security Council strongly condemn the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for its acts of terrorism over many years, and for its continued use of civilians as human shields, and acknowledge the legitimate right of the Government of Sri Lanka to combat terrorism. The members of the Security Council demand that the LTTE lay down its arms and allow the tens of thousands of civilians still in the conflict zone to leave. The members of the Security Council express deep concern at the reports of continued use of heavy calibre weapons in areas with high concentrations of civilians, and expect the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitment in this regard.&quot;

On 16 May 2009, Sri Lankan troops broke through LTTE defences and captured the last section of coastline held by Tamil Tiger rebels. The army reported it was set to &quot;clear&quot; remaining rebel-held land within days. Later the military claimed, citing allegedly intercepted LTTE communications, that rebels were preparing for a mass suicide after being effectively cut off from escape routes. Some rebels were reported to have blown themselves up.

==End of the war==
===16 May: Sri Lanka declares victory===
Addressing the G11 summit in Jordan, President Mahinda Rajapaksa stated &quot;my government, with the total commitment of our armed forces, has in an unprecedented humanitarian operation finally defeated the LTTE militarily&quot;. Sri Lankan Commander of the Army Sarath Fonseka also declared victory over LTTE. Sri Lankan troops raced to clear the last LTTE pockets of resistance. As the last LTTE strongpoints crumbled, Sri Lankan troops killed 70 rebels attempting to escape by boat. The whereabouts of LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran and other major rebel leaders were not certain.

====17 May: Tigers admit defeat====
The LTTE finally admitted defeat on 17 May 2009, with the rebels&#x27; chief of international relations Selvarasa Pathmanathan said, &quot;This battle has reached its bitter end ... We have decided to silence our guns. Our only regrets are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer&quot;.

===18 May: First claim of Prabhakaran&#x27;s death===
The Sri Lankan armed forces claimed that the leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran, was killed in the morning of 18 May 2009 while he was trying to flee the conflict zone in an ambulance. The announcement on state television came shortly after the military said it had surrounded Prabhakaran in a tiny patch of jungle in the north-east. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that, according to Sri Lankan TV, Prabhakaran was &quot;... killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack as he tried to escape the war zone in an Ambulance with his closest aides. Colonel Soosai, the leader of his &quot;Sea Tigers&quot; navy, and Pottu Amman, his intelligence chief were also killed in the attack.&quot;

The head of the Sri Lankan army, General Sarath Fonseka, said the military had defeated the rebels and &quot;liberated the entire country&quot;. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara stated 250 Tamil Tigers, who were hiding and fighting from within the no fire zone, were killed overnight.

===19 May: President addresses the Parliament and Prabhakaran confirmed dead===
Fighting went on until 9:30 am 19 May 2009. The firing stopped as all LTTE fighters died in the battle. Troops started collecting bodies again. This time, Sergeant Muthu Banda, attached to Sri Lanka Army Task Force VIII, reported to Ravipriya that a body similar to Prabhakaran&#x27;s had been found. At 9:00 am on 19 May 2009 President Mahinda Rajapaksa delivered a victory address to the Parliament and declared that Sri Lanka had been liberated from terrorism. Around 9:30 am troops attached to Task Force VIII of Sri Lanka Army, reported to its commander, Colonel G.V. Ravipriya that a body similar to Velupillai Prabhakaran has been found among the mangroves in Nandikadal lagoon. It was identified by the officer. At 12:15 pm Army Commander Sarath Fonseka officially announced Prabhakaran&#x27;s death, through the State television ITN. At around 1:00 pm his body was shown in Swarnavahini for the first time. Prabakaran&#x27;s identity was confirmed by Karuna Amman, his former confidant, and through DNA testing against his son&#x27;s genetic material who had been killed earlier by the Sri Lanka Military. However, LTTE Chief of international relations, Selvarasa Pathmanathan on the same day claimed that &quot;Our beloved leader is alive and safe.&quot; On 24 May 2009, he admitted the death of Prabhakaran, retracting the previous statement. The Sri Lankan Government had declared victory on 19 May 2009.

===Reaction===

The general non-Tamil public of Sri Lanka took to streets to celebrate the end of the decades-long war. Streets were filled with joyous scenes of jubilation. Opposition leader Ranil Wickremasinghe, through a telephone call, congratulated President Rajapaksa and the state security forces for their victory over the LTTE. Religious leaders, too, hailed the end of the bloodshed. International response to the end of the fighting was also positive and welcoming, while some countries expressed concern over the civilian casualties and the humanitarian impact. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said, &quot;I am relieved by the conclusion of the military operation, but I am deeply troubled by the loss of so many civilian lives. The task now facing the people of Sri Lanka is immense and requires all hands. It is most important that every effort be undertaken to begin a process of healing and national reconciliation&quot;. Time magazine named the end of the Sri Lankan civil war as one of the top 10 news stories of 2009.

===Protests===
Tamil diaspora communities around the world protested the civilian casualties in Northern Province, Sri Lanka and the war in general. Active protests occurred in the major and/or capital cities of India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany and the United States.

==Impact==
===Casualties===
The Sri Lankan civil war was very costly, killing more than 100,000 civilians and over 50,000 fighters from both sides of the conflict. Around 27,000+ LTTE cadres, 28,708+ Sri Lankan Army personnel, 1000+ Sri Lankan police, 1500 Indian soldiers were said to have died in the conflict. In 2008, the LTTE revealed that 22,390 fighters have died in the armed struggle since 27 November 1982, although it stopped keeping records in 2009. Secretary of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said in an interview with state television that 23,790 Sri Lankan military personnel were killed since 1981 (it was not specified if police or other non-armed forces personnel were included in this particular figure). The Uppsala Conflict Data Program, a university-based data collection program considered to be &quot;one of the most accurate and well-used data-sources on global armed conflicts&quot;, provides free data to the public and has divided Sri Lanka&#x27;s conflicts into groups based on the actors involved. It reported that, between 1990 and 2009, between 59,193–75,601 people were killed in Sri Lanka during various three types of organized armed conflict: &quot;State-based&quot; conflicts, those that involved the Government of Sri Lanka against rebel groups(LTTE and the JVP), &quot;Non-state&quot; conflicts, those conflicts that did not involve the government of Sri Lanka (e.g. LTTE vs. LTTE-Karuna Faction, and LTTE vs. PLOTE), as well as &quot;One-sided&quot; violence, that involved deliberate attacks against civilians perpetrated by either LTTE or the Government of Sri Lanka.

The &quot;Tamil Centre for Human Rights&quot; recorded that from 1983 to 2004, 54,053 Tamil civilians were murdered by both the Sri Lankan government and IPKF forces. Another organization called NESOHR published that from the beginning of the war to the 2002 ceasefire, 4,000 to 5,000 Tamil civilians were killed in large scale massacres, with a total civilian death of around 40,000. Civilian casualties that occurred in 2009 is of major controversy, as there were no organizations to record the events during the final months of the war. The Sri Lankan government revealed that 9,000 people were killed in the final months of the war, but it did not differentiate between LTTE cadres and civilians. The UN, based on credible witness evidence from aid agencies and civilians evacuated from the &quot;Safe Zone&quot; by sea, estimated that 6,500 civilians were killed and another 14,000 injured between mid-January 2009, when the &quot;Safe Zone&quot; was first declared, and mid-April 2009. There are no official casualty figures after this period but estimates of the death toll for the final four months of the civil war (mid-January to mid-May) range from 15,000 to 20,000. A US State Department report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN&#x27;s estimates and that significant numbers of casualties weren&#x27;t recorded. A former UN official has claimed that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the civil war. Most of the details pertaining to the civilian casualties were reported by four doctors who worked in the no-fire zone. In a joint press conference after the war in July 2009 while still in CID custody, they recanted their initial reports, stating that the casualty figures were exaggerated and were handed to them by the LTTE. However, a leaked US diplomatic cable contains dispatches stating that the doctors upon their release in August 2009 are to have stated to US embassy personnel that they were heavily coached for the press conference and that they had not lied when giving their original statements. A US State Department report has suggested that the actual casualty figures were probably much higher than the UN estimates and that significant numbers of casualties were not recorded. Gordon Weiss, a former UN official has claimed that up to 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final stages of the war. The U.N Secretary General&#x27;s experts panel report had said that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians could have been killed in the final phases of the Sri Lankan civil war.

On the contrary, Rajiva Wijesinha the permanent secretary to the Sri Lanka&#x27;s Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights, in June 2009 said that altogether 3,000 to 5,000 civilians may have been killed during the period. In November 2011, threat specialist Rohan Gunaratna, estimated the number of civilian casualties to be 1,400 (1200 killed by army cross-fire and 200 by LTTE). His estimate is in part based on information obtained from captured LTTE cadres to which he had been granted access and from coroners working in and around the no-fire zone. In February 2012, the Sri Lankan government released an official estimate of civilian deaths in Northern Province, concluding that 8,649 people have died due to extraordinary circumstances (reasons other than ageing, diseases, natural disasters etc.), in 2009. It also listed 2,635 people as untraceable. However the report did not differentiate civilians from the slain LTTE cadres. Several human rights groups have even claimed that the death toll in the last months of the war could be 70,000. The Sri Lankan government has denied all claims of causing mass casualties against Tamils, arguing that it was &quot;taking care not to harm civilians&quot;. Instead, it has blamed the LTTE for the high casualty numbers, stating that they used the civilians as human shields. Both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE have been accused by the U.N for war crimes during the last phase of the war.

While the majority of civilian deaths were that of the Tamil minority, both Sinhalese and Moor civilians died in the war. The LTTE were estimated to be responsible for 3,700 to 4,100 civilian deaths in over 200 separate attacks. In response to the killings of Sinhalese and Muslims, LTTE leader Prabhakaran denied allegations of killing civilians, claiming to condemn such acts of violence; and claimed that LTTE had instead attacked armed home guards who were &quot;death-squads let loose on Tamil civilians&quot; and Sinhalese settlers who were &quot;brought to the Tamil areas to forcibly occupy the land.&quot; However, this figure only accounts for those killed in open attacks. According to Rajan Hoole, various dissident sources allege that the number of Tamil dissenters and prisoners from rival armed groups clandestinely killed by the LTTE in detention or otherwise ranges from 8,000–20,000 although he later stated that western agencies dismissed his figures as exaggeration.

===Economic cost===

The total economic cost of the 25-year war is estimated at US$200 billion. This is approximately 5 times the GDP of Sri Lanka in 2009. Sri Lanka had spent US$5.5 billion only on Eelam War IV, which saw the end of LTTE. The government had spent US$2.25 billion to develop the Northern Province under the &quot;Uthuru Wasanthaya&quot; program after the end of the war. Measuring the opportunity cost of war, a report by Strategic Foresight Group states that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remained stagnant during periods of civil war and that net FDI increased during periods of ceasefire.

==Aftermath==
===Political solution===
After the complete military defeat of the LTTE, President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced that the government is committed to a political solution, and for this purpose action would be taken based on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The pro-LTTE political party Tamil National Alliance (TNA), also the largest political group representing Sri Lankan Tamil community, dropped its demand for a separate state, in favour of a federal solution. There are ongoing bilateral talks between President Rajapaksa&#x27;s UPFA government and the TNA, on a viable political solution and devolution of power.

However, in an interview with Indian television channel Headlines Today, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President of Sri Lanka (former Defence Secretary) and brother of current Prime Minister (former President) Mahinda Rajapaksa dismissed &quot;the political solution talk&quot;, asserting, among other things, that it was &quot;simply irrelevant&quot; because &quot;we have ended this terrorism&quot; in Sri Lanka.

====Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission====
Following the end of the war in May 2009, amid mounting international pressure for an inquiry into the final stages of the war, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to look back at the Sri Lankan civil war, and to provide recommendations for an era of healing and peace building. The commission concluded that the Sri Lankan military didn&#x27;t deliberately target civilians in the No Fire Zones. The commission acknowledged that hospitals had been shelled, resulting in &quot;considerable civilian casualties&quot;, but it did not say who was responsible for the shelling. The commission blamed Sinhalese and Tamil politicians for causing the civil war: the Sinhalese politicians failed to offer a solution acceptable to the Tamil people and the Tamil politicians fanned militant separatism. However, the commission has been heavily criticised by human rights groups and the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s Panel of Experts on Accountability due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses.

====Transitional Justice and steps for non-recurrence====
In 2015, the Sri Lankan government decided to create a truth commission based on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa to probe allegations during the war. According to Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a new constitution is expected to solve issues related to the war and ensure non-recurrence. However, the government criticized both Sinhala and Tamil extremists for obstructing transitional justice.

===Humanitarian impact===
====Internally displaced people====

Towards the end of the war, as Sri Lankan government forces advanced deeper into Tamil Tiger controlled areas, international concern grew for the fate of the 350,000 civilians trapped. On 21 January 2009, the Sri Lankan military declared a 32 square kilometres (12.4 mi) &quot;Safe Zone&quot; located northwest of Puthukkudiviruppu, between the A35 Highway and the Chalai Lagoon. Sri Lankan Air Force aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to relocate to the safe zone and wait until the army could move them into safer locations. The Sri Lankan military promised not to fire into the area. However, only small numbers of civilians actually crossed into the Safe Zone, and the Sri Lankan government, the United Nations, and human rights organisations accused the LTTE of preventing civilians from leaving. The fighting eventually caused civilians to flee the safe zone to a narrow strip of land between Nanthi Kadal and the Indian Ocean. The Sri Lankan military declared a new Safe Zone northwest of Mullaitivu on 12 February. Over the next three months, the Sri Lankan military repeatedly attacked the Safe Zone with aircraft and artillery to destroy the last remnants of the Tamil Tigers trapped there. The Sri Lankan government claimed that it was trying to hit Tamil Tiger positions, and claimed that these raids started on 15 February and ended on 19 April, the day before the Army breached Tamil Tiger defences, and civilians started to pour out. However, these attacks caused heavy damage. Thousands of civilians were killed or injured, and the Tamil Tigers reportedly held many as human shields.

The final stages of the war created 300,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) who were transferred to camps in Vavuniya District and detained there against their will. The camps were surrounded by barbed wire. This, together with the conditions inside the camps, attracted much criticism from inside and outside Sri Lanka. After the end of the civil war President Rajapaksa gave assurances to foreign diplomats that the bulk of the IDPs would be resettled in accordance with the 180-day plan. By January 2012, almost all the IDPs had been resettled, except 6,554 from the Divisional Secretariats of Mullaitivu district, where the de-mining work was yet to be finished.

Since 1983, the civil war caused mass outflow of Tamil civilians from Sri Lanka to South India. After the end of the war, nearly 5,000 of them returned to the country. As of July 2012, 68,152 Sri Lankans were living in South India as refugees.

====Detainees====
The continuous defeats of the LTTE had made its cadres abandon the outfit in large numbers. With the end of the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, including over 500 child soldiers surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Among them were 1,601 females. Government took action to rehabilitate these cadres under a &quot;National Action Plan for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants&quot;. They were divided into 3 categories; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcefully recruited (including child soldiers). 24 rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended cadres, there had been about 700 hardcore members. Some of these cadres were integrated into State Intelligence Services to tackle the internal and external networks of LTTE. By January 2012, the government had released more than 11,000 cadres, and only 4 rehabilitation centres and 550 detainees remained.

====Land mines====

The end of the war left past conflict zones of heavily contaminated with approximately 1.6 million land mines. By September 2023, deminers employed by the Sri Lankan army and 8 foreign funded agencies had cleared leaving about yet to be cleared.

Since the end of the war, more than 5,000 Tamil youths have been gathering at selected police stations in Eastern Province to join the police force as the government has called for interviews. The Sri Lankan government had planned to recruit 2,000 new police officers to the department, especially for the services in the northern region of the country.

===War crimes investigations===
In March 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Commission drafted a resolution on &quot;Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka&quot; and requested its High Commissioner Navi Pillay to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and human rights abuses that have taken place during the war. Subsequently, the Human Rights Commissioner directed the setting up of OHCHR Investigation in Sri Lanka (OISL).

The Sri Lankan state which is accused of perpetuating war crimes, has reportedly refused to cooperate with the inquiry. In August 2014, the state rejected entry visas for investigating U.N. officials. Two months later, in October, Sri Lankan government banned all foreigners from visiting the former war zone altogether.

====War crimes====
There are allegations that war crimes were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE during the war, particularly during the final months of the conflict in 2009. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by both sides; enforced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; the systematic denial of food and medicine by the government to civilians trapped in the war zone; keeping civilians as hostages by the LTTE; and recruitment of child soldiers by the LTTE and the government paramilitary group TMVP.

Video footage showing uniformed men speaking Sinhalese and summarily executing eight bound and blindfolded men was broadcast in August 2009 by UK&#x27;s Channel 4 in a program called &quot;Sri Lanka&#x27;s Killing Fields&quot;. This video was deemed authentic by an UN expert. However, the UN experts were unable to explain the movement of certain victims in the video, 17 frames at the end of the video and the date of 17 July 2009 encoded in the video (the conflict was officially declared over in May 2009). Reports commissioned by the Sri Lankan government claim the UN authentication was biased and the video was fabricated.

A panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the issue of accountability with regard to any alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the conflict in Sri Lanka found &quot;credible allegations&quot; which according to them, if proven, indicated that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers. The panel has called on the UNSG to conduct an independent international inquiry into the alleged violations of international law. The Sri Lankan government has denied that its forces committed any war crimes and has strongly opposed any international investigation. It has condemned the UN report as &quot;fundamentally flawed in many respects&quot; and &quot;based on patently biased material which is presented without any verification&quot;. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, a formal commission of inquiry was appointed by the Sri Lankan President, to review the conflict from 1983 to 2009 and its report was tabled in the parliament.

On 27 July 2012, Sri Lanka brought out a road map fixing time lines for investigating alleged war crimes by its army during the final stages of the war with the LTTE in 2009. The cabinet has approved the action plan for the implementation of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in September 2013 that there had been no comprehensive Sri Lankan effort to properly and independently investigate allegations of war crimes. The High Commissioner said she would recommend the Human Rights Council to set up its own probe if Sri Lanka does not show more &quot;credible&quot; progress by March 2014.

On 27 March 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted for a resolution paving the way for an inquiry into rights abuses at the end of Sri Lanka&#x27;s civil war. The United States and the United Kingdom were among the countries which sponsored the resolution, which for the first time called for an international probe.

The new government of President Maithripala Sirisena has requested the international community for support on a domestic probe into war crimes. As of March 2015, the UN have expressed their support for this.
The Tamil National Alliance has asked for an international investigation into the alleged human rights abuses during the Sri Lankan civil war and has refused a domestic probe. A group of the TNA led by Wigneshwaran has asked for an investigation into the alleged genocide claims but the TNA as a whole was divided on the issue and MP Senathirajah said that the action was unauthorized by the party.

The Tamil National Alliance has welcomed a domestic investigation with a hybrid court; R. Sampanthan praised several new initiatives from the new government and said &quot;The government is adopting the correct position,&quot; and asked the government to honor to their commitments. But some members, such as Ananthi Sasitharan, had a less optimistic view.

In January 2020, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said of the people who disappeared during the war: &quot;The unfortunate truth is that these people had died during the battles. Even in the security forces there are about 4,000 personnel listed as missing. But in reality these people had died during the fights, but their bodies had not been recovered&quot;. He promised a proper internal investigations and death certificates. During the numerous conflicts in Sri Lanka it was estimated over 20,000 had disappeared in Sri Lanka and the President&#x27;s statement was heavily criticized by human rights organisations.

In February 2020, the US State Department and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that General Shavendra Silva, current commander of the Sri Lankan Army, was banned from entering the United States due to war crimes committed by the 53rd division of the Sri Lankan army, in which he has involvement through command responsibility.

In January 2023, the Canadian Government along with Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly imposed sanctions on former presidents Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa and two members of the Sri Lankan Army, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake and Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, over &quot;gross and systematic violations of human rights&quot;.

====Allegations of genocide====
The first international voice to support the charge of genocide against the Government of Sri Lanka under international law was raised by Human Rights Watch and it has advocated and published the details in December 2009. Leading American expert in international law, Professor Francis A. Boyle held an emergency meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to urge to stop Tamil genocide by providing the evidence of crimes against humanity, genocide against Tamils and the international community&#x27;s failure to stop the slaughter of Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka.

In January 2010, the Permanent People&#x27;s Tribunal on Sri Lankan held its sessions in Dublin, Ireland. There were four findings:
# That the Sri Lankan Government and its military are guilty of War Crimes;
# That the Sri Lankan Government and its military are guilty of crimes against humanity;
# That the charge of genocide requires further investigation;
# That the international community, particularly the UK and US, share responsibility for the breakdown of the peace process.(2)
It also found that member states of the United Nations had not &quot;complied with their moral obligation to seek justice for the violations of human rights committed during the last period of the war&quot;.

On 22 September 2010, the UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic, has advocated and litigated on behalf of victims of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka. UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic released a report calling for the establishment of a new international tribunal to prosecute those most responsible for the crimes committed during the conflict. UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic also submitted evidence of human rights violations committed during the armed conflict to the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka, which U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed in 2010.

On 3 November 2012, panel of 11 member International Experts, consisting of experts in genocide studies, former UN officials, experts in international law and renowned peace and human rights activists to be convened as Judges appointed by Permanent People&#x27;s Tribunal to investigate and examine reports submitted by many specialised working groups on the accusation of the crime of Genocide against the Government of Sri Lanka.

On 27 March 2013, Tamil Nadu State Assembly has passed resolution which called on the Indian Government to stop considering Sri Lanka as a &#x27;friendly country&#x27; and impose economic sanctions, as well as calling for an international inquiry in &quot;genocide and war crimes&quot; against Sri Lankan Tamils.

On 10 December 2013, Permanent People&#x27;s Tribunal unanimously ruled Sri Lanka guilty of the crime of genocide against the Tamil people, while the US and UK were found to be guilty of complicity to this crime.

In January, 2015, UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic filed a paper on &quot;The Legal Case of the Tamil Genocide&quot; based on the evidence, nature and extent of the violence committed by Government Forces against Tamils.

On 12 April 2015, the Northern Provincial Council of Sri Lanka passed a resolution calling the UN to investigate the genocide and direct appropriate measures at the International Court of Justice stating that the Tamils had no faith in the domestic commission.

In September 2017, president Maithripala Sirisena refused to let several human rights groups take Jagath Jayasuriya to court for war crimes. He reportedly said &quot;I stated very clearly that I will not allow anyone in the world to touch Jagath Jayasuriya or any other military chief or any war hero in this country,&quot; in reference to the lawsuit. His comments are seen as an attempt to pander to the majority ethnic Sinhalese, most of whom oppose legal action against military personnel accused of crimes during the civil war.

<text>Ross J. Connelly (born April 25, 1952) is the former executive vice president and COO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Connelly currently serves as Managing Director of Akkadian private Ventures which mobilizes U.S. investment and businesses projects across South America, the Middle East and Asia. Prior to OPIC, Connelly worked for Bechtel Corporation, where he was an executive (1977) and later a senior principal with Bechtel Investments (1982 - 1991) (which later became the Fremont Group) and the president of Bechtel Energy Resources, Inc. (1991 - 1993). In 1993, Connelly was elected President of Northgas, a Bechtel joint-venture dedicated to developing natural gas resources in northern Russia. He held this position until he left Bechtel in 1995.

== Education ==
Connelly earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree of Political Science in 1974 from Duke University and his master&#x27;s degree in Foreign Service  - specializing in international trade and finance - from Georgetown University&#x27;s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in 1977. 

==Biography==
In 1998, Connelly ran for Maine&#x27;s first district House of Representatives seat on the Republican ticket and lost to fellow Republican James Longley. In 2000, Connelly directed the Maine branch of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign. In October 2001, Bush rewarded Connelly by appointing him to serve on the board of OPIC, the government office that provides political insurance to U.S. companies who want to invest in unstable parts of the world.

Since his appointment to the OPIC board, Connelly has traveled to Afghanistan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Serbia, Peru, and the Middle East to promote U.S. overseas investments, in particular the investments of U.S. companies (including Bechtel) in the privatization of foreign oil, power, water, and transportation infrastructures.

Connelly has attracted criticism for his role in OPIC projects and investments which critics say will directly benefit his former employers. In his tenure at OPIC, Connelly finalized OPIC&#x27;s $130 million loan to Lima Airport Partners, a joint venture between Bechtel to privatize Jorge Chávez International Airport in Lima. He has also been involved in OPIC&#x27;s investments in Serbia, a country where Bechtel has been awarded large highway building contracts.

<doc id="225290" wikidata="Q840399" url="?curid=225290" title="Championship Auto Racing Teams">
<text>Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) was a sanctioning body for American open-wheel car racing that operated from 1979 until dissolving after the 2003 season. CART was founded in 1979 by team owners formerly from the United States Auto Club (USAC) Championship Car division. The owners disagreed with the direction and leadership of USAC. They developed a then-novel business model of team owners sanctioning and promoting their own series collectively rather than relying on a neutral governing body to do so.

While the CART owners broke off to form their own series, the sport&#x27;s biggest race and centerpiece – the Indianapolis 500 – remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the CART Indy Car World Series became the pre-eminent open-wheel auto racing series in North America. It features a diverse schedule of superspeedways, short ovals, road courses, and street circuit. The CART-based teams continued to compete at the Indianapolis 500, essentially as a one-off. From 1983 to 1995, an arrangement was put in place in which the Indy 500 would pay points to the CART championship. Though it was still sanctioned by USAC, it was effectively integrated into the CART season schedule.

Even as the series prospered, concerns about costs, competitiveness, and revenue sharing began to create opposition to CART&#x27;s organizational structure. Attempts at reform, which saw the company rebranded as &quot;IndyCar&quot; in 1992 and a compromise board formed, failed. In 1996, an open wheel &quot;split&quot; saw the newly created Indy Racing League (IRL) take full control over the Indianapolis 500 and start a competing oval-based open-wheel series. CART ceased using the IndyCar name but continued its series without participating in the Indianapolis 500.

The &quot;split&quot; saw a dramatic drop in interest for open wheel racing in the United States, which was compounded by the growing popularity of NASCAR, creating a downward trend in sponsorship and attendance at some tracks. After a series of additional setbacks in the early 2000s, several of the major teams and manufacturers defected to the rival IRL. CART went bankrupt at the end of the 2003 season. 

In 2004, a trio of team owners acquired the assets of the series from bankruptcy, rebranding it the Champ Car World Series (CCWS). Continuing financial difficulties caused Champ Car to file for bankruptcy before its planned 2008 season; CART and CCWS assets and history were merged into the IRL&#x27;s IndyCar Series.

==Vehicles==

Champ cars (typically referred to as &quot;Indy cars&quot; before 1997) were single-seat, open-wheel racing cars, with mid-mounted engines. Champ cars had sculpted undersides to create ground effects and prominent wings to create downforce. The cars would use different aerodynamic kits depending on whether they were racing on an oval or a road-course.

Teams typically purchased chassis constructed by independent suppliers such as Lola, Swift, Reynard, and March, with some owners, such as Dan Gurney and Roger Penske, constructing their own. The series exclusively used Goodyear tires until 1995, when Firestone entered, creating a spirited competition between the brands. Firestone ultimately became the exclusive supplier in 2000, with their parent company Bridgestone taking over the role in 2002.

Champ cars used turbocharged engines that ran on methanol fuel. Cosworth (later branded as the Ford-Cosworth), Ilmor (branded as Chevrolet), and Buick engines were common powerplants through the mid-1990s. Mercedes-Benz took over as Ilmor&#x27;s branding, while Honda and Toyota joined as factory efforts. By the 1990s, engines were typically leased from manufacturers, who conducted research and development during the racing season; one engine could easily dominate competition in the first part of the season and then fall behind. The exclusive availability of more advanced versions of engines to certain teams in the early-1990s became a major source of contention within the organization, and manufacturers fiercely resisted proposals to have engines simply be purchased by teams. In 2003, after the withdrawal of Honda and Toyota, CART purchased a series of identical 2.65L V-8 turbocharged Cosworth engines and leased them to teams under Ford branding.

Champ cars were visually similar, and often compared to, the higher budget and more technical Formula 1 cars, which also featured wings, mid-engines, and an open-wheel design. Due to their use on ovals, Champ Cars weighed more and were more substantial in size, were slower to accelerate but were higher in top speed. Both series intentionally downplayed direct comparisons for commercial reasons, but 2002 saw a rare occurrence in both series running the same track (Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal) within a month of each other. Former Chip Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya won the pole position for the Formula One race with a lap time of 1&#x27;12.836, with the slowest being Alex Yoong&#x27;s 1&#x27;17.34; Several weeks later, Cristiano da Matta won pole position in a Champ Car race with a lap time of 1&#x27;18.959.

==History==
===Foundation===


In 1905 the AAA established a national driving championship and became the first sanctioning body for auto racing in the United States. The AAA ceased sanctioning auto racing in the general outrage over motor racing safety that followed the 1955 Le Mans disaster. In response, Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony Hulman formed the United States Auto Club (USAC) to take over the sanctioning of what was called &quot;championship&quot; auto racing, or open wheel racing, whose biggest event was the annual Indianapolis 500 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. USAC sanctioned the championship exclusively until 1978, and was the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s recognized American authority with regard to open wheel racing.

Competitors in the championship circuit, coalescing around Dan Gurney, began to become critical of USAC&#x27;s sanctioning though the 1970s. Notable incidents included the loss of a lucrative series sponsorship by Marlboro in 1971 after USAC failed to enforce the brand&#x27;s exclusivity at events, the existence of dirt tracks, purses that teams said would result in a loss in money even if the team made the podium, and a lack of modern promotion for the non-Indianapolis events in the series.

In early 1978, Gurney wrote what came to be known as the &quot;Gurney White Paper&quot;, the blueprint for an organization called Championship Auto Racing Teams. Gurney took his inspiration from the improvements Bernie Ecclestone had forced on Formula One with his creation of the Formula One Constructors Association. The White Paper called for the owners to form CART as an advocacy group to promote their interests in USAC&#x27;s national championship. The group would also work to negotiate television rights, sponsorship agreements, and race purses, and ideally hold seats on USAC&#x27;s governing body. In 1978, the last season that USAC was sole sanctioning body for Championship racing, their 18 race schedule had 4 road course races and 14 oval track races.

On April 23, 1978, eight top USAC officials died in an airplane crash, creating an organizational vacuum that severely hampered the 1978 season. In November 1978 Gurney, joined by other leading team owners including Roger Penske and Pat Patrick, took their requests to USAC&#x27;s Board, but the proposal was rejected, leading to the creation of a new stand-alone series. The first CART race was held on 11 March 1979, with the Sports Car Club of America sanctioning the series.

USAC initially tried to ban all CART drivers from the 1979 Indianapolis 500, informing CART teams by telegram during their event at Atlanta Motor Speedway, until CART succeeded in obtaining an injunction to allow its cars to qualify. Of the 20 races held in 1979, 13 were part of the 1979 CART Championship. An attempt by USAC and CART to jointly sanction races in 1980 as the Championship Racing League saw USAC withdraw after 5 races, and by the end of 1981 the only USAC sanctioned asphalt championship race was the Indianapolis 500.

===CART PPG Indy Car World Series (1982–1991)===
By 1982, the CART PPG Indy Car World Series was generally recognized as the American national championship in open wheel racing. In 1983, USAC agreed to allow CART to add the Indy 500 to its schedule and have drivers be awarded points in the CART championship while retaining their authority to sanction the 500. Beginning with a schedule mainly based on oval speedways like its USAC predecessor, the series began to replace the declining Can-Am series in prominent North American road racing circuits such as Road America, Mid-Ohio, and Laguna Seca. Many racing stars, including Mario Andretti, Bobby Rahal, and Danny Sullivan found success in CART, which by the mid-1980s expanded by sanctioning street races, taking over the Detroit Grand Prix and the Grand Prix of Long Beach from Formula One, and expanding to Toronto and Cleveland. CART founded the first full-time driver safety team that traveled with the series, instead of depending on local staff provided by promoters.

For the first time, open-wheel racing outside of Indianapolis had developed a stable schedule, enabling more generous sponsorship and television opportunities for team owners. Despite the corresponding increases in attendance, TV revenue, and purses, CART&#x27;s egalitarian governing structure created its own headaches. CART owners were incredibly diverse: For example, owners such as Carl Haas and Roger Penske owned speedways and had generous contracts with tire, chassis, and engine manufactures, while other teams simply purchased older cars and ran the races they could afford to attend. The diversity of interests led to annual disputes and accusations of real and apparent conflicts of interest with regard to rules, sponsorship, driver safety, track selection, and other matters.

In 1988, CART joined ACCUS, allowing foreign drivers to compete without risking their FIA Super Licences. This, combined with former F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s series title in 1989, attracted drivers from South America and Europe to join what had previously been a mostly American dominated series. A growing contingent of international drivers helped make the series a valuable television property for growing sports cable networks worldwide. CART would host its first race outside North America, in Surfers Paradise, Australia, in 1991.

===IndyCar and the &quot;Split&quot; (1992–1996)===
Tony Hulman&#x27;s grandson, Tony George, became president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in 1989. He and others viewed foreign drivers and street circuits as discouraging predominantly American USAC sprint racing talent, such as Jeff Gordon, from competing in CART. NASCAR, which ran predominantly on ovals, was gaining in popularity in CART&#x27;s traditional Midwestern US market at the time. Costs were also rapidly increasing and pricing out smaller teams, as the larger teams and engine and chassis manufacturers competed for victories.

Critics regularly accused CART of only serving the interests of team owners, especially the richest ones, and not of the sport as a whole; the owners countered that the teams – who took the most risks, paid the drivers, and expended the most cash – should control the general direction of the sport. CART owners also resented George, and felt that his close relationship with the USAC meant he could jeopardize the series&#x27; involvement in the Indianapolis 500 on a whim. Debate continued for a number of years over the proper oversight mechanism for the sport, with IMS resisting any revenue sharing or control over the Indianapolis 500 and team owners not wanting to give too much power to track promoters. In an attempt to address these concerns, CART rebranded as IndyCar in 1992, and later that year formed a compromise board. The owners would elect five members with voting rights, while the IndyCar CEO (representing the other owners) and George (representing IMS) would have non-voting seats.

In 1993, British driver Nigel Mansell, the 1992 F1 Driver&#x27;s Champion, switched to IndyCar and beat out Fittipaldi for the championship. After the season, the compromise CART board collapsed following a series of controversial decisions, mainly shutting out Japanese manufacturers, cancelling a planned race at Brands Hatch in the United Kingdom, and not increasing the number of races on the 1994 schedule. Team owners angry with the decisions believed they were motivated by the personal business interests of George and two powerful owners, Roger Penske and Carl Haas, rather than the good of the sport as a whole.

The conflict between George and CART owners came to a head in 1994. On January 7, the organization named Andrew Craig, a British sports marketing executive, as its new president and CEO, replacing William Stokkan. The same day, George resigned his non-voting seat on the board; IMS stated that George&#x27;s resignation had nothing to do with Craig&#x27;s appointment, but rather it was out of frustration with CART&#x27;s decision to revert to a 16-member board after the collapse of the five-member compromise board late the previous year.
That year, Team Penske introduced a Mercedes-Benz engine specifically designed for the 1994 Indianapolis 500 that exploited a rule difference between the USAC and IndyCar, dominating the race and prompting fears that costs would continue to grow out of control. In July, IMS announced the founding of the Indy Racing League, which would be cost-controlled, race solely on American ovals, and be sanctioned by the USAC.
After officiating errors in the 1995 Indianapolis 500 saw driver complaints about USAC&#x27;s oversight, George announced that for the 1996 Indianapolis 500 the top 25 drivers in IRL points would be guaranteed a spot in the race, leaving only eight of the 33 grid positions available to others. This was known as the &quot;25/8 Rule,&quot; and was unprecedented, as the 500 had traditionally always put every spot up for open qualification. CART alleged they had been locked out of the event and would no longer race at Indianapolis, while George declared that CART was boycotting the 500. To placate sponsors who contractually required the accommodation of large contingents to attend Indianapolis, CART created a rival showcase event, the U.S. 500, at Michigan International Speedway on the same day as the Indy 500 in 1996. In March, IMS attempted to terminate CART&#x27;s license to their &quot;IndyCar&quot; trademark in federal court.

The lead-up to Memorial Day 1996 saw a public relations war pitting the owners and drivers of CART against George and IMS, which included Indianapolis legends like the Unser and Andretti families publicly criticizing the new rules and labelling the Indy 500, with less experienced drivers, as unsafe. The 1996 Indianapolis 500 did see a series of accidents, with a quarter of the race run under caution before Buddy Lazier won his first race. The U.S. 500, starting halfway through the Indy 500, had a disastrous start with a twelve-car crash, delaying the race for an hour. Jimmy Vasser, who won by 11 seconds, quipped &quot;Who needs milk?&quot; while exiting his car for the podium, referring to the tradition of the Indy 500 winner drinking a bottle of milk in victory lane. Both at the time and in retrospect, the weekend was seen as a fiasco that began a serious decline in open-wheel racing, with both the Indy 500 and other IndyCar events seeing drastic decline in prominence, television viewership, and attendance.

===CART FedEx Championship Series (1997–2000)===
After a number of competing lawsuits, CART agreed to revert to their formal initialism following the 1996 season, on the condition that the IRL would not use the IndyCar name before the end of the 2002 season. CART began promoting its vehicles as &quot;champ cars,&quot; the term that had previously been used by USAC&#x27;s championship division.

In the early years after the CART–IRL split, CART was in a far stronger position. It held most of the prestigious races, sponsorship money, most of the &quot;name&quot; drivers and teams, and was the preferred series for manufacturers due to the IRL&#x27;s ban on engine leases. The IRL&#x27;s primary asset was Indianapolis Motor Speedway and its 500. 1996 and 1997 saw generally well-regarded racing with stars such as Vaseer, rookie sensation Alex Zanardi, and Michael Andretti leading the points standings, while the IRL experienced growing pains, including a rain-soaked 1997 Indianapolis 500, off-putting engine sounds from their new normally-aspirated engines, and the abandonment of USAC sanctioning due to incompetence.

CART, in further contrast to IMS&#x27;s sole ownership of the IRL, opted to proceed with a public stock offering, selling on the NASDAQ as stock symbol MPH. The offering raised US$100 million by selling 35% of the company. While this allowed CART to have sufficient cash reserves to expand and purchase the Indy Lights series, commentators suggested it was short-sighted to subject the notoriously secretive and fluctuating finances of the auto racing industry to public trading requirements.

Efforts, led mostly by engine manufacturers, to pressure CART and the IRL to at least adopt uniform engine standards were met with a cold refusal from the IRL, which started to carve a niche in the motorsports landscape by leveraging close relationships with the new NASCAR spec ovals being built, with the series&#x27; substantial losses being underwritten by the other revenue streams of IMS.

Despite the split, CART saw its annual revenues increase from $38,000,000 in 1995 to $68,800,000 by 1999, street races remained lucrative, and teams were able to make some gains on sponsorship revenues. The success was uneven, as the series&#x27; traditional oval races in Michigan and Nazareth began to see dramatic attendance declines, which CART blamed on substandard marketing. Television ratings and revenue were anemic, with the series receiving $5,000,000 annually for the entirety of its television package, less than the rate for some individual NASCAR races. While CART&#x27;s stock was generally considered healthy, investors noted that the company&#x27;s valuation tended to fluctuate with the perceived success or failure of IRL merger talks.

CART&#x27;s championship battle in 1999 between young stars Juan Pablo Montoya and Dario Franchitti was overshadowed by the deaths of drivers Gonzalo Rodríguez and Greg Moore within two months of each other. Moore&#x27;s death at the 1999 Marlboro 500 especially raised serious concerns about safety in the 500-mile races conducted in Fontana and Michigan that saw Champ Cars average speeds of near .

In 2000, after years of frustration building behind the scenes, CART owners forced Andrew Craig to resign as CEO, and popular driver/owner Bobby Rahal stepped in as his interim replacement. Seeing the continued success of street racing and the decline of the series&#x27; oval dates, the board announced an intention of moving away from traditional venues toward overseas ovals and more street races to generate sanctioning fees, to the frustration of some of the traditional owners and United States–based sponsors.

Chip Ganassi, under pressure from his main sponsors, also persuaded the board to leave Memorial Day open on the schedule and returned to the Indy 500 with Vasser and Montoya. Montoya put on a dominating performance at Indy, leading 167 of the 200 laps to win. The Ganassi team&#x27;s primary advantage was the greater engineering put into their IRL-spec car. 2000 would see Team Penske&#x27;s return to prominence as Gil de Ferran won the driver&#x27;s title.

===Decline (2001–2003)===
For 2001, CART unveiled their most ambitious schedule yet, with 22 races in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. The loss of Homestead-Miami and Gateway to the IRL was to be offset by the addition of Texas Motor Speedway, which had seen an exciting IRL race the year prior. Rahal retired to head Jaguar Racing in Formula 1, leading to marketing expert Joseph Heitzler taking the helm.

Brazil was cancelled after track promoters defaulted. The race at Texas Motor Speedway had to be cancelled on race day, due to concerns of drivers blacking out at the high G forces created by Champ cars on the heavily banked course during qualifying. While applauded for putting driver safety first, the cancellation was a publicity disaster, and CART was criticized for not conducting enough pre-race testing on the circuit. A resulting lawsuit, while settled, produced a quarterly loss for CART&#x27;s stock and forever harmed its relationship with track owner Speedway Motorsports.

Despite CART teams sweeping the top 6 positions in the 2001 Indianapolis 500 and a highly competitive four-way points battle among Gil de Ferran, Kenny Brack, Hélio Castroneves, and Michael Andretti, headlines centered on a technological controversy regarding a turbo pop off valve that Honda and Ford had developed, prompting complaints by Toyota. When CART mandated changes in the valve to help equalize the competition, Honda successfully obtained an injunction barring the change, leading to all three manufacturers being upset. Toyota would announce it would move to the IRL for 2003 at the end of the season.

The series&#x27; first foray into Europe, the German 500, was overshadowed by the 9/11 attacks that occurred the Tuesday before the Saturday race. With the teams unable to leave due to the worldwide shutdown of airspace, CART decided to run the race as scheduled after some controversy, with ESPN refusing to air the race live. The race would see popular former champion Alex Zanardi lose both legs in an accident. The series inaugural event in the United Kingdom would come close to being cancelled due to track concerns.

To keep coverage of the Indianapolis 500, ABC/ESPN signed an exclusive television deal for 2002 onwards with the IRL, forcing CART to turn to Speed Channel for cable coverage and buy time on CBS to maintain a broadcast presence. Team Penske announced after the season that they would become permanent entrants in the IRL for 2002 due to pressure from sponsor Marlboro resulting from the American tobacco settlements that prevented cigarette advertising in multiple series.

The loss of ESPN/ABC&#x27;s exposure and engine manufacturer sponsoring began a downward spiral for the series, as race promoters began demanding reduced sanctioning fees for 2002 and sponsors began to review their agreements. Heitzler was fired by the CART board in the offseason, being replaced by Chris Pook, the well-regarded CEO of the Long Beach Grand Prix. Making matters worse was CART&#x27;s growing ownership instability due to the public offering: Despite an initial agreement for the car owners to maintain 65% of the stock, agreements allowed owners to divest shares in the company. As car owners began to sell off their shares, the board&#x27;s chronic issues grew more complicated with aggressive stockholders beginning to pressure the board alongside owners.

During the 2002 season, Honda announced that it would move to the IRL the following year, causing a drastic decline in CART&#x27;s stock and leaving Cosworth/Ford as the sole engine manufacturer for 2003. Attempts to subsidize teams to have enough cars racing to avoid breaching sanctioning contracts led to a further decline in cash reserves and the stock price. Team owner Gerald Forsythe was able to purchase enough stock to control 22.5% of the voting shares in concert with the board. Star driver Michael Andretti purchased the prominent Team Green and moved them to the IRL with heavy direction from Honda, and Chip Ganassi Racing left due to pressure from its primary sponsor, Target.

Beginning in 2003, after the withdrawal of FedEx as series sponsor, CART re-branded itself as &quot;Bridgestone Presents The Champ Car World Series Powered by Ford&quot;. The series ran a near complete schedule of road course races, featuring chassis from the year before.

=== Reformation as Champ Car ===
CART, running out of cash reserves, declared bankruptcy after the 2003 season and its assets were liquidated. The IRL made a strategic bid to keep the series dormant, while a trio of CART owners (Forsythe, Paul Gentilozzi, and Kevin Kalkhoven) along with Dan Pettit made a bid for CART&#x27;s assets as Open Wheel Racing Series, LLC. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the OWRS bid as more beneficial to creditors than the IRL bid, despite it being smaller.

Champ Car would continue to run until declaring bankruptcy and being &quot;reunified&quot; with the IRL in February 2008. IndyCar recognizes the records and champions of both series in its historical records.

==Television==
In its early years, television coverage of CART races were shared by NBC, ABC and ESPN. NBC left after the 1990 season, and returned for 1994&#x27;s race in Toronto only. CBS also aired races from 1989 to 1991 and also aired the 1995 race at Nazareth. ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 continued as broadcasters until 2001.

In the 2002 and 2003 Champ Car seasons, coverage was split between CBS and Speed Channel (Fox aired the 2002 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach). Also from 2002 to 2004, select races aired on high definition channel HDNet such as Road America race in 2003.

Outside the United States, Screensport showed CART in the UK, Ireland, Scandinavia, France, Germany and the Benelux countries including the Indy 500 from 1984-1992. 

Eurosport aired CART and Champ Car in Europe from 1993 until its demise. In the UK Sky Sports showed the races in 1992 on a tape delay and the Indy 500 live.

ITV showed races on World of Sport and later on as a bought in programme as part of the Night Time service in 1988 and later highlights between 1993 and 1994. 

From 1997 to 2001, Channel 5 showed races on early Wednesday mornings though in 1998 showed them as live on the Sunday night.

In Brazil, Rede Record aired the Indy 500 in 1984. From 1985 until 1992, Rede Bandeirantes aired the race and from 1989 onwards, they aired the whole season on TV. Between 1993 and 1994, the CART season was broadcast by Rede Manchete. 

Following economical difficulties by the former broadcaster and to battle Rede Globo for the lead of audience, SBT took the rights to transmission from Manchete, including its trio of narrators (Téo José, Luiz Carlos Azenha, and Dedê Gomes), and even sending one of their helicopters to get exclusive images from the races. They broadcast the entire season live between 1995 and 2000, although from 1999 onwards, following complaints by Gugu Liberato because of audience size, the races were delayed and transmitted at 11:00PM, after the Programa Silvio Santos, although a few races remained live, such as Surfers&#x27; Paradise (because of the time, which was in the middle of the night) and the Rio 200. From 1997 onwards, the series was referred to as &quot;Fórmula Mundial&quot; (Worldwide Formula), following the split between CART and the Indy Racing League. In the first years, the category was able to challenge Globo and its F1 transmission, but after most of the races were reallocated to VT in the night, the audience stagnated. After the contract expired in 2000, SBT opted to not renew it. 

Record once again broadcast the series between 2001 and 2002, again mostly in VTs (with commentary provided by Oscar Ulisses), but the transmissions were delayed to around 7PM, rather than skipping to the end of the night. After an declining audience in 2002, the broadcaster didn&#x27;t renovated the contract.

In 2003, RedeTV! broadcast the Champ Car series, bringing back commentator Téo José. However, although the races were back on being live, the audience was still rather low and following the decline of the category, they chose to not renew the contact after the end of the 2004 season. 

The Globo-owned SporTV channel broadcast the 2004 season to replace the IRL, but following the contract expiring at the end of the season, they didn&#x27;t renovated, marking the end of the CART/Champ Car broadcasting in Brazil.

<text>Émile Gallé (; 4 May 1846 in Nancy – 23 September 1904 in Nancy) was a French artist and designer who worked in glass, and is considered to be one of the major innovators in the French Art Nouveau movement. He was noted for his designs of Art Nouveau glass art and Art Nouveau furniture, and was a founder of the École de Nancy or Nancy School, a movement of design in the city of Nancy, France.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Gallé born on 4 May 1846 in the city of Nancy, France. His father, Charles Gallé, was a merchant of glassware and ceramics who had settled in Nancy in 1844, and his father-in-law owned a factory in Nancy which manufactured mirrors. His father took over the direction of his mother&#x27;s family business, and began to manufacture glassware with a floral design. He also took over a struggling faience factory and began manufacturing new products.

The young Gallé studied philosophy and natural science at the Lycée Imperial in Nancy. At the age of sixteen he went to work for the family business as an assistant to his father, making floral designs and emblems for both faience and glass. In his spare time he became an accomplished botanist, studying with D.A. Godron, the director of the Botanical Gardens of Nancy and author of the leading textbooks on French flora. He collected plants from the region and from as far away as Italy and Switzerland. He also took courses in painting and drawing, and made numerous drawings of plants, flowers, animals and insects, which became subjects of decoration. 
At the age of sixteen he finished the Lycée in Nancy and went to Weimar in Germany from 1862–1866 to continue his studies in philosophy, botany, sculpture and drawing. In 1866, to prepare himself to inherit the family business, he went to work as an apprentice at the glass factory of Burgun and Schwerer in Meisenthal, and made a serious study of the chemistry of glass production. Some of his early glass and faience works for the family factory at Saint-Clémont were displayed at the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition. In early 1870 he designed a complete set of dishware with a rustic animal designs for the family enterprise. During this time he became acquainted with the painter, sculptor and engraver Victor Prouvé, an artist of the romantic &quot;troubadour&quot; style, who became his future collaborator in the Nancy School.

He enlisted for military service in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, then was demobilised after the disastrous French defeat in 1871 and the French loss to Germany of much of the province of Lorraine, including Meisenthal where he had done his apprenticeship. Thereafter the Cross of Lorraine, the patriotic symbol of the region, became part of his signature on many of his works of art.

After his demobilization Gallé went to London, where he represented his father at an exhibition of the arts of France, then to Paris, where he remained for several months, visiting the Louvre and Cluny Museum, studying examples of ancient Egyptian art, Roman glassware and ceramics, and especially early Islamic enamelled glass, a technique which influenced his own later work. After further travel to Switzerland and Italy, he returned to Nancy and established his own workshop at the glass factory. His father Charles continued as head of the company, but Émile gradually took charge of the design and production. In 1873 he took up residence in La Garenne (&quot;the rabbit warren&quot;), the three-story neoclassical house built by his father and surrounded by gardens.
===Head of the company and international success===
In 1874 the elder Gallé turned the family business, the Maison Gallé-Reinemer, over to Émile. The following year Émile married Henriette Grimm, and after years of traveling, settled permanently in Nancy. He regrouped and reorganized the divisions of faience and glass manufacture, and in 1883 built new and larger workshops for glass and faience manufacture also for making furniture. By 1889 he had over three hundred employees. His own office and studio was in the center of the complex. He trained the designers himself, and sent them water colors of floral designs he made in the gardens of his residence. Gallé ordered his designers to use only real flowers and plants as their models, though they could take some liberties in the final design. He wrote in 1889, &quot;it is necessary to have a pronounced bias in favour of models taken from flora and fauna, while giving them free expression.&quot;

Gallé continued to expand his activities. In 1885 he opened his first shop in Paris at 12 rue Richter, followed by other shops in Frankfurt-am-Maine and London. He also took part on a grand scale in international expositions; beginning with the 1878 Paris Universal Exposition, where his pavilion was thirty meters long; the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago; and especially the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition, which was the summit of his fame. His work at the Exposition was rewarded with two Grand Prizes, a gold medal, and the title of a commander in the Legion of Honor.
===Later years===
In 1901, Gallé became the founder and first President of the École de Nancy, the organization of Nancy artists of the new style. Created to encourage the arts in Nancy, the glassmaker Antonin Daum, furniture maker Louis Majorelle and Eugene Vallin as Vice Presidents. He had many distinguished patrons, including the Edmond James de Rothschild, and his works were purchased by museums. In the highest form of tribute, his works were imitated by other glass and ceramics firms.

Much of his later work used symbolism, and expressed conflict. On one vase, called &quot;Fiori Oscuri&quot;, he engraved the words of Robert de Montesquiou: &quot;I love the hour when everything changes its form, when light and dark struggle together.&quot;

He became involved in social causes. He was a founder, along with Victor Prouvé, of the Université populaire de Nancy, offering university-level classes to workers. He was treasurer of the Nancy branch of the Human Rights League of France and in 1898, at great risk for his business, one of the first to become actively involved in the defense of Alfred Dreyfus. He also publicly defended the Romanian Jews and spoke up in defense of the Irish Catholics in Britain, and supported William O’Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish revolt.

In 1904, his health worsened. He was diagnosed with leukemia, and died on 23 September 1904. His son-in-law, Professor Pedrizet of Nancy University, took over the direction of the firm, but the new management did not keep up with the new styles, and the firm went out of business in 1931. Only the carved wooden door survives of his original studio, now in the garden of the Musée de l&#x27;École de Nancy.

Gallé wrote a book on art entitled &quot;Écrits pour l&#x27;art 1884–89&quot; (&quot;Writings on Art 1884–89&quot;), which was published posthumously in 1908.

==Glassware==
===Cased glass, cameo glass and enamel glass===
Cased glass and cameo glass were two techniques often used by Gallé. Cased glass was made of two different layers of glass of different colors, fused together by heat. The first case of layer is made in a cold. When it is finished and cooled, a second layer is blown inside the first Then the piece is placed into the furnace, so the two layers fuse together. This could be repeated for multiple layers of glass. Cameo glass was a means of decorating cased glass. The cased glass of two or more colors was carved with a diamond saw or etched with acid, so that the colors of the layer underneath were visible and created a design. Enamel glass was decorated on the outside by a brush of enamels colored by metallic oxides.

===Glass marquetry and patinated glass===
Gallé continually experimented with new techniques of glass art. One of his major innovations was glass marquetry, or applying layers of glass on an object. He attached thin sheets of colored glass onto a hot glass object He could join the laminations or overlay them, adding an infinite number of layers and colors. This technique had been practiced by the Venetians during the Renaissance, but Gallé pushed it much further. While it allowed him almost limitless variations, it also presented great difficulties, since the glass had to be reheated for each new layer, and could easily crack.

Another difficulty was the appearance of defects and imperfections caused by contamination of the glass paste by dust or ashes or other materials, which caused what glassmakers called &quot;bubbles&quot;, &quot;grease&quot; or stitches&quot; inside the glass. Galleé decided to take advantage of the defects. He wrote in his patent application, &quot;Concerned about such defects, I had the idea of using them as a decorative means, which permitted me, by inducing the effect in various ways, to obtain an entirely new type of decoration, called &quot;patina&quot;.&quot; Gallé proposed dusting the surface of the hot glass, which would give the appearance of fabric, or thick cobweb, or other textures. He proposed to make further decoration the surface with engraving, sand blasting, and wheel carving, and to embed fragments of hot glass into this patina or outer layer. The final result would then be covered with a thin layer of clear crystal, which could be left plain or also patinated.
===Colors===
Gallé was particularly innovative in the creation and use of colored glass. As early as 1878 he colored glass with a small quantity of cobalt oxide to make a delicate sapphire tone which he called &quot;Clair de lune&quot;, or &quot;moonlight&quot;. He sometimes covered this with a glaze of cobalt blue. It was widely imitated by other glassmakers, particularly in Germany and England, where it was called &quot;Mondschein&quot;, or &quot;moonlight&quot;. He wrote that he created &quot;yellows, some iridescent browns and greens with a base of silver and sulphur, a peacock blue with copper and iron, browns from sulphur and catechu.&quot; He also tried out rare metals such as thallium and iridium, which made particularly dark shadows. His most original and characteristic colors were a deep violet made with manganese, usually on an opaline ground; a pink made with selenium or copper, which he created 1889; and a green made with &quot;chromium&quot;, which he used to case pieces in three or four layers, giving nn exceptional depth and richness of color.
His style, with its emphasis on naturalism and floral motifs, was at the forefront of the emerging Art Nouveau movement.

His early work was executed using clear glass decorated with enamel, but he soon turned to an original style featuring heavy, opaque glass carved or etched with plant motifs, often in two or more colors as cameo glass.

He continued to incorporate experimental techniques into his work, such as metallic foils and air bubbles, and also revitalized the glass industry by establishing a workshop to mass-produce his, and other artists&#x27;, designs.

===Flowers===
A large number of his glass works, especially vases, are inspired by and named for flowers. He was a dedicated botanist, and had an extensive flower garden at this residence as a source of models. He also required his artists to use actual plants as models if they were depicting them. They also had a strong symbolic appeal for Gallé. He wrote in 1893 that according to Saint Paul each flower and fruit has a particular symbolic meaning; the olive leaf is peace, wheat is charity and goodness; the grape is the symbol of the Eucharist; the fig is generosity; the Veronica flower is fidelity, the myrtle is joy, the narcissus is springtime in nature, and so forth.
===Insects and undersea worlds===
Natural subjects were always present in his work. Flower, plants, insects and marine creatures were frequent subjects; he created vases that seemed to be brimming with fish and other animals, and others with forest scenes abounding with colorful dragonflies and other insects.
==Furniture==
Gallé became interested in wood in 1885, when he was looking for exotic woods to make sculpted bases for his vases. He was intrigued by the extraordinary variety of colors and reflective qualities of the woods being imported into Europe from colonies around the world. Within a year, he had created his own furniture workshop, employing experienced carpenters, sculptors, varnishers and experts in marquetry, as well as craftsmen in bronze and iron to make the knobs, locks, and other hardware. He was aided in design by experienced collaborators such as Victor Prouvé. Unlike some designers of the Arts and Crafts movement, he was willing to use machine tools to speed up the manufacture, if it did not diminish the quality of the final product. He began to experiment, sculpting the locks, using patinas of bronze and heating the locks to get exactly the color he wanted. He created a collection of six hundred different varieties of wood. so he could create marquetry in exactly the color and shade, and nuances of the grain he wanted. By 1889 he was able to mount a very successful display of his furniture at the Paris Universal Exposition.

He described his inspiration for furniture design in a long article called &quot;Contemporary furniture decorated following nature&quot; published in the November–December 1900 issue of the &quot;Revue des Arts Decoratifs&quot;. He argued that true beauty could never be found &quot;in the acceptance of the falseness and mediocrity of prettiness without character or in opulence without spirit.&quot; He argued that it could only be found in the concentrated application of the principles of structural and linear growth of Nature. Following this doctrine, every detail and motif in his furniture was taken directly from nature.
==Ceramics and pottery==
His early ceramics of Gallé were generally plates and vases with more traditional floral designs. The faience, or glazed earthenware of Gallé, rarely achieved the same level of technical quality and fame as his glassware. He largely abandoned it after 1892. However, it contained much of the same imagination and unusual as his glass. His ceramics and glazed earthenware of Gallé oftenl, looked like real earth, employing earthy brown colors, with overlays of leaves and insects

<doc id="225335" wikidata="Q331409" url="?curid=225335" title="Cro-Magnon rock shelter">
<text>Cro-Magnon (, ; ) is an Aurignacian (Upper Paleolithic) site, located in a rock shelter at Les Eyzies, a hamlet in the commune of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, Dordogne, southwestern France.

Most notably, it is the site of the discovery of anatomically modern human remains, apparently buried at the site, dated to about 28,000 years ago. The find is also called Cro-Magnon after the name of the rock shelter. Because of its archeological importance, &quot;Abri de Cro-Magnon&quot; was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley site.
== Human remains ==

In 1868, workmen found animal bones, flint tools, and human skulls in the rock shelter. French geologist Louis Lartet was called for excavations, and found the partial skeletons of four prehistoric adults and one infant, along with perforated shells used as ornaments, an object made from ivory, and worked reindeer antler.

These &quot;Cro-Magnon men&quot; were identified as the prehistoric human species of Europe, as distinct from Neanderthal Man, described a few years earlier by William King based on the Neanderthal 1 fossil discovered in Germany in 1856. Lartet proposed the subspecies name &quot;Homo sapiens fossilis&quot; in 1869. The term &quot;Cro-Magnon Man&quot; soon came to be used in a general sense to describe the oldest modern people in Europe. By the 1970s, the term was used for any early modern human wherever found, as was the case with the far-flung Jebel Qafzeh remains in Israel and various Paleo-Indians in the Americas. 

Cro-Magnon 1 consists of a skull and partial skeletal remains belonging to a male individual, approximately 40 years old. It is dated to 27,680 ± 270 Before Present (BP). The cranial cavity measures . The capacity of a modern adult anatomically modern human&#x27;s cranial cavity is .

Cro-Magnon 2 is a partially preserved female skull with marked facial similarities to Mladeč 2.

Cro-Magnon 3 is a partial skull of a male adult.

The remains are thought to represent adults who died at an advanced age, who were placed at the site, along with pieces of shell and animal teeth in what appear to have been pendants or necklaces, in an apparent intentional burial. The presence of necklaces and tools suggests the concept of grave goods.

Analysis of the pathology of the skeletons shows that the humans of this period led a physically difficult life. In addition to infection, several of the individuals found at the shelter had fused vertebrae in their necks, indicating traumatic injury; the adult female found at the shelter had survived for some time with a skull fracture. As these injuries would be life-threatening even today, this suggests that Cro-Magnons relied on community support and took care of each other&#x27;s injuries. In addition, Cro-Magnon 1 suffered from a genetic condition called Neurofibromatosis type I, which would have led him to have large cysts or tumours on his face, evident in the depression in the frontal bone and pits of the eyebrows and cheek bones.

Compared to Neanderthals, the skeletons showed the same high forehead, upright posture and slender (gracile) skeleton as modern humans. The other specimens from the site are a female, Cro-Magnon 2, and male remains, Cro-Magnon 3.

==Boxing==
Events
* 2 February — Ben Caunt fights Nicholas Ward at Crookham Common for the Championship of England. As in Ward&#x27;s fight with Burke a few months earlier, there is controversy as the referee is again forced by Ward&#x27;s backers to rule in his favour. The referee disqualifies Caunt in the 7th round for allegedly striking Ward when he is down.

<text>1845 in sports describes the year&#x27;s events in world sport.

==Baseball==
Events
* 23 September — formal organisation of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club or New York Knickerbockers, initiated by Alexander Joy Cartwright, including adoption of twenty rules. Fourteen of the club rules are the earliest known written rules for playing baseball 
* 22 October — &quot;New York Morning News&quot; publishes the first known box score for a baseball game, played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey in Hoboken, New Jersey

==Boxing==
Events
* 9 September — William &quot;Bendigo&quot; Thompson finally returns to the ring after recovery from his serious knee injury. He fights Ben Caunt at Stony Stratford for the Championship of England and is victorious after 93 rounds when Caunt is disqualified for going down without having been struck. Caunt denies the accusation and announces his retirement, leaving Bendigo as undisputed champion.

==Cricket==
Events
* 21 &amp; 22 August — the present Surrey County Cricket Club is formed at a meeting which takes place at the new Kennington Oval during a match between two local teams
England
* Most runs – Fuller Pilch 569 @ 21.07 (HS 117)
* Most wickets – William Hillyer 174 @ 12.30 (BB 8–30)

==Football==
Events
* Written version of Rugby School football rules which allow the ball to be carried and passed by hand. These rules are the earliest that are definitely known to have been written. They are a major step in the evolution of rugby league and rugby union; not to mention Australian rules football, American football, Gaelic football, etc. The Rugby School rules make a clear distinction between the &quot;handling&quot; game and the &quot;dribbling&quot; game. Dribbling is running with the ball at one&#x27;s feet.
* Although Eton College rules allow the ball to be touched and controlled by hand, they do not allow running with the ball in the hand or passing of the ball by hand. So, whereas Rugby School has effectively created the first &quot;handling game&quot; rules, Eton could have created the earliest rules of the &quot;dribbling game&quot;.
* Introduction of referees at Eton. Linesmen at the time are called umpires.

==Horse racing==
England
* Grand National – Cure-All
* 1,000 Guineas Stakes – Picnic 
* 2,000 Guineas Stakes – Idas
* The Derby – The Merry Monarch
* The Oaks – Refraction 
* St. Leger Stakes – The Baron

==Rowing==
The Boat Race
* 15 March — Cambridge wins the 7th Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, a revival of the race last contested in 1842
