<text>The history of the Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870 spans the period of the history of the Cape Colony during the Cape Frontier Wars, which lasted from 1779 to 1879. The wars were fought between the European colonists and the native Xhosa who, defending their land, fought against European rule. 
The Cape Colony was the first European colony in South Africa, which was initially controlled by the Dutch but subsequently invaded and taken over by the British. After war broke out again, a British force was sent once more to the Cape. After a battle in January 1806 on the shores of Table Bay, the Dutch garrison of Cape Castle surrendered to the British under Sir David Baird, and in 1814, the colony was ceded outright by the Netherlands to the British crown. At that time, the colony extended to the mountains in front of the vast central plateau, then called &quot;Bushmansland&quot;, and had an area of about 194,000 square kilometres and a population of some 60,000, of whom 27,000 were white, 17,000 free Khoikhoi, and the rest slaves. These slaves were mostly people brought in from other parts of Africa and Malays.

==First and second frontier wars==

The first of several wars with the Xhosa had already been fought by the time that the Cape Colony had been ceded to the United Kingdom. The Xhosa that crossed the colonial frontier had been expelled from the district between the Sundays River and Great Fish River known as the Zuurveld, which became a neutral ground of sorts. For some time before 1811, the Xhosa had taken possession of the neutral ground and attacked the colonists. In order to expel them from the Zuurveld, Colonel John Graham took the area with a mixed-race army in December 1811, and eventually the Xhosa were forced to fall back beyond the Fish River. On the site of Colonel Graham’s headquarters arose a town bearing his name: Graham&#x27;s Town, subsequently becoming Grahamstown.

A difficulty between the Cape Colony government and the Xhosa arose in 1819, the immediate cause of which was an attempt by the colonial authorities to enforce the restitution of some stolen cattle. On 22 April 1819, led by a prophet-chief named Makana, they attacked Graham’s Town, then held by a handful of white troops. Upon the arrival of reinforcements, the Xhosa troops retreated. It was then agreed that the land between the Fish and the Keiskamma rivers should be neutral territory.

==1820 Settlers==
The war of 1817–1819 led to the first wave of immigration of British settlers of any considerable scale, an event with far-reaching consequences. The then-governor, Lord Charles Somerset, whose treaty arrangements with the Xhosa chiefs had proved untenable, wished to buffer the Cape from contact with the Xhosa by settling white colonists in the border region. In 1820, upon the advice of Lord Somerset, Parliament voted to spend £50,000 (£ today) to promote migration to the Cape, encouraging 4,000 British people to migrate to the buffer area. These immigrants, now known as the 1820 Settlers, settled in an area they called Albany and grew settlements in Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown. The settlers were intended primarily to secure the frontier, as well as a means for the British government to relieve unemployment in Britain. However, the scheme had further implications: the settlers retained their loyalty to Britain, and in the course of time, formed a counterpoint to the Dutch colonists.

This migration also introduced the English language to the Cape. English language ordinances were issued for the first time in 1825, and in 1827, the use of English was extended to judicial proceedings. Dutch was not, however, ousted, and the colonists became largely bilingual.

Over the ensuing decades, there was considerable political tension between the eastern and the western halves of the Cape Colony. The Eastern Cape, from its major port and urban centre Port Elizabeth, resented being ruled from Cape Town in the Western Cape, and frequently agitated to become a separate colony. These separatist tensions did not completely die down until the 1870s, when Prime Minister John Molteno restructured the Cape administration to meet the major concerns of the eastern colonists and, in the Constitutional Amendment Bill of 1873, abolished the last formal distinctions.

==Dutch hostility to British rule==
Although the colony was prosperous, many Dutch farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with that of the Dutch East India Company, though their grievances were not the same. In 1792, Moravian missions had been established for the benefit of the Khoikhoi, and in 1799, the London Missionary Society began to try to convert both the Khoikhoi and the Xhosa. The championship of Khoikhoi grievances by the missionaries caused much dissatisfaction among the majority of the colonists, whose conservative views temporarily prevailed, for in 1812, an ordinance was issued which gave magistrates the power to bind Khoikhoi children as apprentices under conditions little different from those of slavery. In the meantime, the movement for the abolition of slavery was gaining strength in England, and the missionaries appealed at length, from the colonists to Britain.

An incident which occurred from 1815 to 1816 did much to make the Dutch frontiersmen permanently hostile to the British. A farmer named Bezuidenhout refused to obey a summons issued to him after a complaint from Khoikhoi was registered. He fired on the party sent to arrest him, and was killed by the return fire. This caused a miniature rebellion, and in its suppression five ringleaders were publicly hanged by the British at Slagter&#x27;s Nek where they had originally sworn to expel &quot;the English tyrants&quot;. The resentment caused by the hanging of these men was deepened by the circumstances of the execution, for the scaffold on which the rebels simultaneously were hanged broke from their united weight and the men were hanged one by one afterwards. The deeply religious Dutch frontiersmen believed the collapsing scaffold to be an act of God. An ordinance passed in 1827 abolished the old Dutch and courts, instead substituting resident magistrates. The ordinance further stipulated that all legal proceedings be henceforth conducted in English.

A subsequent ordinance in 1828 granted equal rights with white people to the Khoikhoi and other free African people in the Cape. Another ordinance in 1830 imposed heavy penalties for harsh treatment of slaves, and finally the emancipation of slaves was proclaimed in 1834. Each of these ordinances drew further ire from the Dutch farmers towards the Cape government. Moreover, the inadequate compensation awarded to slave-owners, and the suspicions engendered by the method of payment, caused much resentment, and in 1835 the trend where farmers trekked into unknown country in order to escape from a disliked government recommenced. Emigration beyond the colonial border had in fact been continuous for 150 years, but it now took on larger proportions.

==Third cape frontier war (1834–1836)==

On the eastern border, further trouble arose between the government and the Xhosa, towards whom the policy of the Cape government was marked by much vacillation. On 11 December 1834, a government commando party killed a Xhosa chief of high rank, incensing the Xhosa: an army of 10,000 men, led by Maqoma, a brother of the chief who had been killed, swept across the frontier, pillaged and burned the homesteads and killed all who resisted. Among the worst sufferers was a colony of freed Khoikhoi who, in 1829, had been settled in the Kat River valley by the British authorities. There were few available soldiers in the colony, but the governor, Sir Benjamin d&#x27;Urban acted quickly and all available forces were mustered under Colonel Sir Harry Smith, who reached Graham&#x27;s Town on 6 January 1835, six days after news of the violence had reached Cape Town. The British fought the Xhosa warriors for nine months until hostilities were ended on 17 September 1836 with the signing of a new peace treaty, by which all the country as far as the River Kei was acknowledged to be British, and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat of government was selected and named King William&#x27;s Town.

==Great Trek (1836–1840)==
The British government did not approve of the actions of Sir Benjamin d&#x27;Urban, and the British Secretary for the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, declared in a letter to the King that &quot;the great evil of the Cape Colony consists in its magnitude&quot; and demanded that the boundary be moved back to the Fish River. He also eventually had d&#x27;Urban dismissed from office in 1837. Lord Glenelg&#x27;s dispatch of 26 December stated: &quot;The Kaffirs had an ample justification for war; they had to resent, and endeavoured justly, though impotently, to avenge a series of encroachments.&quot; This attitude towards the Xhosa was one of the many reasons given by the Voortrekkers for leaving the Cape Colony. The Great Trek, as it is called, lasted from 1836 to 1840. The trekkers (Boers), numbering around 7,000, founded communities with a republican form of government beyond the Orange and Vaal rivers, and in Natal, where they had been preceded, however, by British emigrants. From this time on, Cape Colony ceased to be the only European community in South Africa, though it was the most predominant for many years.

Considerable trouble was caused by the emigrant Boers on either side of the Orange River, where the Boers, the Basothos, other native tribes, Bushmen, and Griquas fought for superiority, while the Cape government endeavoured to protect the rights of the native Africans. On the advice of the missionaries, who exercised great influence on all non-Dutch people, a number of the &quot;native states&quot; were recognised and subsidised by the Cape government with the objective of creating peace on the northern frontier. The first &quot;Treaty States&quot; to be recognised was Griqualand West of the Griqua people. Subsequent states were recognised between 1843 and 1844. While the northern frontier became more secure, the state of the eastern frontier was deplorable, with the government either unable or unwilling to settle disputes between Xhosa and Cape farmers.

Elsewhere, however, the colony was making progress. The change from slave to free labour proved to be advantageous to the farmers in the western provinces. An efficient education system, owing its inception to Sir John Herschel, an astronomer who lived in Cape Colony from 1834 to 1838, was adopted. Road Boards were established and proved to be very effective in constructing new roads. A new stable industry, sheep-raising, was added to the original set of wheat-growing, cattle rearing, and wine making. By 1846, wool became the country&#x27;s most valuable export. A legislative council was established in 1835, giving the colonists a share in the government.

==War of the Axe (1846)==
Another war with the Xhosa, known as the War of the Axe or Amatola War, broke out in 1846, when a Khoikhoi escort who had been manacled to a Xhosa thief was murdered while transporting the man to Graham&#x27;s Town to be tried for stealing an axe. A party of Xhosa attacked and killed the escort. The surrender of the murderer was refused, and war was declared in March 1846. The Ngqikas were the chief tribe engaged in the war, assisted by the Ndlambe and Thembu. The Xhosa were defeated on 7 June 1846 by General Somerset on the Gwangu, a few miles from Fort Peddie. However, the war continued until Sandile, the chief of the Ngqika, surrendered. Other chiefs gradually followed this action, and by the end of 1847 the violence died down after 21 months of fighting.

==Extension of British sovereignty (1847)==

In December 1847, or what was to be the last month of the War of the Axe, Sir Harry Smith reached Cape Town by boat to become the new governor of the colony.

===Expansion of the Cape Colony===
He reversed Glenelg&#x27;s policy soon after arrival, and embarked on a policy of unilateral conquest of neighbouring lands. A proclamation he issued on 17 December 1847 extended the borders of the colony northwards to the Orange River and eastward to the Keiskamma River, roughly doubling the area of the Cape Colony.

This was done without consulting the British Government, or the local Boers and African states which now found themselves annexed. However, his expansionist policy against the neighbouring Xhosa did win him the local support of the extremist colonists of the Eastern Cape frontier.

===Establishment of British Kaffraria===

A few days later, at a meeting of the Xhosa chiefs on 23 December 1847, Sir Harry announced the annexation of the land between the Keiskamma and the Kei Rivers to the British crown, thus re-absorbing the territory that had been given up by Lord Glenelg. The land was not, however, incorporated into the Cape Colony, but instead made a crown dependency under the name of British Kaffraria.

The Xhosa did not initially offer violent resistance against this annexation, and they were mainly left alone as the governor had other serious matters to contend with, including the assertion of British authority over the Boers beyond the Orange River, and the establishment of amicable relations with the Transvaal Boers.

==Convict agitation and granting of a constitution (1848–1853)==
A crisis arose in the colony over a proposal to make the Cape Colony a convict station. A circular written in 1848 by Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, then colonial secretary, was sent to the governor of the Cape, as well as other colonial governors, asking them to ascertain the feelings of the colonists regarding the reception of a certain class of convicts. The Earl intended initially to send Irish peasants who had been driven to crime by the Great Famine of 1845 to South Africa. Sir Harry Smith was very much aware of his unpopularity in the Colonial Office due to his unilateral and expensive colonisation of neighbouring territories. Smith saw a way of winning favour in London, by allowing the Cape to be used as a convict station.

However Smith did not consult the local population on this plan for the Cape which prided itself on being a colony of &quot;free settlement&quot;, so when the first convict ship arrived there was uproar among the locals and triggering the convict crisis. Local people, who were already upset about Smith&#x27;s perceived dictatorial rule, established an anti-convict association whose members bound themselves to cease from all interaction of any kind with persons in any way associated &quot;with the landing, supplying or employing convicts&quot;.

The boat, a vessel named the &quot;Neptune&quot;, had 289 convicts on board, among whom was the famous Irish rebel John Mitchel and his colleagues. Sir Harry Smith had the support of the extremist settlers of the Eastern Cape, whose expansion onto Xhosa lands he had facilitated, but he could not govern without the consent of the powerful Cape Town elite, or his Legislative Council from which they had resigned en masse. Confronted with public resistance, he agreed not to allow the convicts to land when the &quot;Neptune&quot; arrived in Simon&#x27;s Bay on 19 September 1849, but to keep them on board the ship until he received orders to send them elsewhere. When the home government became aware of the state of affairs, orders were sent directing the &quot;Neptune&quot; to proceed to Tasmania, and it did so after staying in Simon’s Bay for five months.

The agitation did not fade away without further achievements, as it had thrown up a generation of local leaders who believed that Britain did not understand or sympathise with local issues. The momentum of this, South Africa&#x27;s first mass-movement, continued as a drive to obtain a free, representative government for the colony. The British government granted this concession, which had been previously promised by Lord Grey, and a constitution was established in 1854 of almost unprecedented liberality. The first Cape Parliament was elected in the same year.

==Eighth frontier war (1850–1853)==
The anti-convict move had scarcely ended when the colony was once again involved in a war. The Xhosa bitterly resented Sir Harry Smith&#x27;s recent annexation of their lands, and had secretly been preparing to renew their struggle ever since the last war. Sir Harry Smith, informed of the increasing Xhosa mobilisation, went to the border region and summoned Sandile and the other chiefs for a meeting. Sandile refused to attend the meeting, after which the governor declared him deposed from his chieftainship at an assembly of other chiefs in October 1850, and appointed an English magistrate named Mr Brownlee to be temporary chief of the Ngqika tribe. It seems that the governor believed that he would be able to prevent a war and that Sandile could be arrested without armed resistance. Colonel George Mackinnon, who had been sent out with a small army with the goal of arresting the chief, was attacked in a narrow gorge on 24 December 1850 by a large number of Xhosa gunmen. After some casualties, Mackinnon&#x27;s men were driven back under heavy fire. This minor shoot-out prompted a general rising among the whole Ngqika tribe. Settlers in military villages that had been established along the border, were caught in a surprise attack after they had gathered to celebrate Christmas Day. Many of them were killed, and their houses set on fire.

Other setbacks followed in quick succession. The greater part of the Xhosa police deserted, many of them leaving with their arms. Emboldened by their initial success, a large and powerful contingent of Xhosa troops surrounded and attacked Fort Cox, where the governor was stationed with a small number of soldiers. More than one unsuccessful attempt was made to kill Sir Harry, and he began to explore ways to escape. Eventually, at the head of 150 mounted riflemen, accompanied by Colonel Mackinnon, he fought his way out of the fort, and rode to King William’s Town through heavy Xhosa fire – a distance of 12 miles (19 km).

Meanwhile, a new threat to the Cape arose. Some 900 of the Kat river Khoikhoi, who had in former wars been firm allies of the British, joined their former enemies: the Xhosa. They were not without justification. They complained that while serving as soldiers in former wars – the Cape Mounted Rifles consisted largely of Khoikhois – they had not received the same treatment as others serving in defence of the colony, that they got no compensation for the losses they had sustained, and that they were in various ways made to feel they were a wronged and injured race. A secret alliance was formed with the Xhosa to take up arms in order to remove the Europeans and establish a Khoikhoi republic. Within a fortnight of the attack on Colonel Mackinnon, the Kat river Khoikhoi were also in arms. Their revolt was followed by that of the Khoikhoi at other missionary stations, and some of the Khoikhoi of the Cape Mounted Rifles followed their example, including some of the very men who had escorted the governor from Fort Cox. But many of the Khoikhoi remained loyal, and the Fingo likewise sided with the Cape government.

After the confusion caused by the surprise attack had subsided, Sir Harry Smith and his force turned the tide of war against the Xhosa. The Amatola Mountains were stormed, and Sarhili, the highest ranking chief, who had been secretly assisting the Ngqika all along, was harshly punished. In April 1852, Sir Harry Smith was recalled by Earl Grey, who accused him – unjustly, in the opinion of the Duke of Wellington – of a want of energy and judgement in conducting the war; he was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Cathcart. Sarhili was again attacked and forced to submit. The Amatolas were then cleared of Xhosa militia, and small forts were erected to prevent their reoccupation.

The British commanders were hampered throughout by their insufficient equipment, and it was not until March 1853 that the largest of the Frontier wars was brought to an end after the loss of several hundred British soldiers. Shortly afterwards, British Kaffraria was made a crown colony. The Khoikhoi settlement at Kat River remained, but the Khoikhoi power within the colony was crushed.

==Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854–1858)==

In 1854, the &quot;lung sickness&quot; disease spread through the cattle of the Xhosa. The disease arrived in South Africa with infected animals imported from the Netherlands by the settlers in 1853 to improve their herds. Widespread cattle deaths resulted. In April 1856, two girls, one named Nongqawuse, went to scare birds out of the fields. When she returned, she told her uncle Mhlakaza that she had met three spirits at the bushes, and that they had told her that all cattle should be slaughtered, and their crops destroyed. On the day following the destruction, the dead Xhosa would return and help expel the whites. The ancestors would bring cattle with them to replace those killed. Mhlakaza believed the prophecy, and repeated it to the chief Sarhili.

Sarhili ordered the commands of the spirits to be obeyed. At first, the Xhosa were ordered to destroy their fat cattle. Nongqawuse, standing in the river where the spirits had first appeared, heard unearthly noises, interpreted by her uncle as orders to kill more and more cattle. At length, the spirits commanded that not an animal of all their herds remain alive and all grain destroyed. If that were done, on a given date, myriads of cattle more beautiful than those destroyed would issue from the earth, while great fields of corn, ripe and ready for harvest, would instantly appear. The dead would rise, trouble and sickness vanish, and youth and beauty come to all alike. Unbelievers and the white man would perish. Great kraals were also prepared for the promised cattle and huge skin sacks to hold the milk that would soon be more plentiful than water. At length, the day dawned, which, according to the prophecies, was to usher in the terrestrial paradise. The sun rose and sank, but the expected miracle did not happen.

This movement drew to an end by early 1858. By then, approximately 40,000 people had starved to death and over 400,000 cattle had been slaughtered. Among the survivors was the girl Nongqawuse; however, her uncle perished. Sir George Grey, governor of the Cape at the time, ordered the European settlers not to help the Xhosa unless they entered labour contracts with the settlers who owned land there. Governor Grey and his administration believed in a conspiracy called the &#x27;Chief’s Plot&#x27; where they claimed the chiefs deliberately starved their people to instill desperation so that the Xhosa would be recruited for war and attack the settlers. This narrative was used at the time to justify the confiscation of land from numerous chiefdoms. The land was distributed to colonial settlers, and over two hundred farms of around 1,500 acres each were created.

Historians view this movement as a millenarian response both directly to the lung disease spreading among Xhosa cattle and to the stress to Xhosa society caused by the continuing loss of their territory and autonomy. J. B. Peires, a leading historian on the conflict who wrote the standard account of the events, &quot;The dead will arise: Nongqawuse and the great Xhosa Cattle-Killing movement of 1856-7&quot;, summarizes the wider implications of the event as &quot;the dogged resistance to colonial expansion which the Xhosa had sustained for nearly eighty bitter years was abruptly broken&quot;. Peires emphasized the role of Governor Grey, who both encouraged the movement then capitalized on its failure via the confiscation of land, imprisonment of chiefs, and exploitative labor contracts of the newly famished Xhosa. Another scholar summarizes the event as achieving &quot;clear domination for the British over a powerful African kingdom when eight costly frontier wars had been unable to&quot;.

==Sir George Grey’s governorship (1854–1870)==

Sir George Grey became governor of the Cape Colony in 1854, and the development of the colony owes much to his administration. In his opinion, policy imposed upon the colony by the home government&#x27;s policy of not governing beyond the Orange River was mistaken, and in 1858 he proposed a scheme for a confederation that would include all of South Africa, however it was rejected by Britain as being impractical. Sir George kept open a British road through Bechuanaland to the far interior, gaining the support of the missionaries Robert Moffat and David Livingstone. Sir George also attempted for the first time, missionary effort apart, to educate the Cape Xhosa and to firmly establish British authority among them, which the self-destruction of the Xhosa rendered easy. Beyond the Kei River, the Transkei Xhosa were left to their own devices.

Sir George Grey left the Cape in 1861. During his governorship the resources of the colony had increased with the opening of the copper mines in Little Namaqualand, the mohair wool industry had been established and Natal made a separate colony. The opening, in November 1863, of the railway from Cape Town to Wellington, and the construction in 1860 of the great breakwater in Table Bay, long needed on that perilous coast, marked the beginning in the colony of public works on a large scale. They were the more-or-less direct result of the granting to the colony of a large share in its own government.

The province of British Kaffraria was incorporated into the colony in 1865, under the title of the Electoral Divisions of King William’s Town and East London. The transfer was marked by the removal of the prohibition of the sale of alcoholic beverages to the natives, and the free trade in intoxicants which followed had most deplorable results among the Xhosa tribes. A severe drought, affecting almost the entire colony for several years, caused great economic depression, and many farmers suffered severely. It was at this period in 1869 that ostrich-farming was successfully established as a separate industry.

Whether by or against the wish of the home government, the limits of British authority continued to extend. The Basotho, who dwelt in the upper valleys of the Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British government from 1843 to 1854; but having been left to their own resources on the abandonment of the Orange sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare with the Boers of the Orange Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh, they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory became part of the Cape Colony in 1871 (see Basutoland). In the same year, the southeastern part of Bechuanaland was annexed to Britain under the title of Griqualand West. This annexation was a consequence of the discovery there of rich diamond mines, an event which was destined to have far-reaching results.

<text>111 (one hundred [and] eleven) is the natural number following 110 and preceding 112.

==In mathematics==

111 is the fourth non-trivial nonagonal number, and the seventh perfect totient number. 

111 is furthermore the ninth number such that its Euler totient formula_1 of 72 is equal to the totient value of its sum-of-divisors: 
:formula_2 

Two other of its multiples (333 and 555) also have the same property (with totients of 216 and 288, respectively).

=== Magic squares ===

The smallest magic square using only 1 and prime numbers has a magic constant of 111:

Also, a six-by-six magic square using the numbers 1 to 36 also has a magic constant of 111:

(The square has this magic constant because 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 34 + 35 + 36 = 666, and 666 / 6 = 111).

On the other hand, 111 lies between 110 and 112, which are the two smallest edge-lengths of squares that are tiled in the interior by smaller squares of distinct edge-lengths (see, squaring the square).

=== Properties in certain radices ===

111 is formula_3 or the second repunit in decimal, a number like 11, 111, or 1111 that consists of repeated units, or ones. 111 equals 3 × 37, therefore all triplets (numbers like 222 or 777) in base ten are repdigits of the form formula_4. As a repunit, it also follows that 111 is a palindromic number. All triplets in all bases are multiples of 111 in that base, therefore the number represented by 111 in a particular base is the only triplet that can ever be prime. 111 is not prime in decimal, but is prime in base two, where 1112 = 710. It is also prime in many other bases up to 128 (3, 5, 6, ..., 119) . In base 10, it is furthermore a strobogrammatic number, as well as a Harshad number.

In base 18, the number 111 is 73 (= 34310) which is the only base where 111 is a perfect power.

==Nelson==

In cricket, the number 111 is sometimes called &quot;a Nelson&quot; after Admiral Nelson, who allegedly only had &quot;One Eye, One Arm, One Leg&quot; near the end of his life. This is in fact inaccurate—Nelson never lost a leg. Alternate meanings include &quot;One Eye, One Arm, One Ambition&quot; and &quot;One Eye, One Arm, One Arsehole&quot;.

Particularly in cricket, multiples of 111 are called a double Nelson (222), triple Nelson (333), quadruple Nelson (444; also known as a salamander) and so on.

A score of 111 is considered by some to be unlucky. To combat the supposed bad luck, some watching lift their feet off the ground. Since an umpire cannot sit down and raise his feet, the international umpire David Shepherd had a whole retinue of peculiar mannerisms if the score was ever a Nelson multiple. He would hop, shuffle, or jiggle, particularly if the number of wickets also matched—111/1, 222/2 etc.

==In other fields==
111 is also:
*The emergency telephone number in New Zealand; see 111 (emergency telephone number).
*NHS 111, a medical helpline in England and Scotland.

<text>Shellac was an American noise rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1992 by Steve Albini (guitar and vocals), Bob Weston (bass guitar and vocals) and Todd Trainer (drums and vocals). Their lineup remained consistent until Albini&#x27;s death in May 2024.

They have been classified as post-hardcore and math rock, but described themselves as a &quot;minimalist rock trio.&quot;

==Biography==
Shellac formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1992 as an informal collaboration between guitarist Steve Albini of noise rock trios Big Black and Rapeman, and drummer Todd Trainer from the band Breaking Circus and solo project Brick Layer Cake. Former Naked Raygun bassist Camilo Gonzalez sat in on early rehearsals and played on one song on Shellac&#x27;s first single before Volcano Suns bassist Bob Weston joined as a permanent member. Both Weston and Albini were recording engineers. They preferred a sparse, analog recording sound with little or no overdubbing, and were meticulous about microphone placement and choice of equipment.

Shellac had a distinctive, minimalist sound based on asymmetric time signatures, repetitive rhythms, an angular guitar sound, and both Albini&#x27;s and Weston&#x27;s surreal, bitingly sarcastic lyrics. Songs typically do not have traditional verse/chorus/verse structure and the arrangements were sparse, to the point where some described them as &quot;amelodic&quot;. Shellac&#x27;s signature sound was often associated with their enthusiasm for vintage Travis Bean guitars, a rare brand of aluminium-necked instruments, and the Interfax &quot;Harmonic Percolator&quot; distortion pedal. Albini was known to use copper plectrums and typically wrapped his guitar strap around his waist rather than over his shoulder. The band preferred the intimacy of smaller clubs and live appearances were sporadic.

Mid-set in many live performances, Shellac took the time for one or more &quot;question and answer&quot; sessions, where members of the band responded in an off-the-cuff and, at times, jocular manner to questions shouted out by fans and hecklers alike. The band made an early decision to not play at festivals, and this position was articulated to All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties (ATP) festival organizer Barry Hogan during the preparation stage of the inaugural ATP event. However, Scottish band Mogwai, curating the festival, convinced Albini to perform: &quot;[ATP] completely changed the festival game. Now the whole world has to operate under the knowledge that there are these cool, curated festivals where everyone is treated well and the experience is a generally pleasant one.&quot; In 2002, the band curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. Knowing that most of the audience had come specifically to see Shellac, the band went on first every morning as an incentive for the festival-goers to be up in time to see the other acts. A CD of tracks from the bands performing at the festival was released on ATP Records.

To celebrate their 20th anniversary as a band, Shellac returned to ATP to curate once more in December 2012 with the line-up including Wire, Scrawl, Mission Of Burma, the Ex + Brass Unbound, Red Fang, Shannon Wright, the Membranes, Alix, Bear Claw, Helen Money, Dead Rider, Arcwelder, Neurosis, Mono, Melt Banana, Uzeda, Prinzhorn Dance School, Three Second Kiss, Buke and Gase, Oxbow, Nina Nastasia, Zeni Geva, Bottomless Pit, Pinebender, STNNNG and more.

Touch and Go Records released the bulk of Shellac’s material, starting with a couple of singles in 1993 and the band’s debut album &quot;At Action Park&quot; in 1994. Because of Albini and Weston’s full-time careers as audio engineers, Shellac would record their music gradually over the following decades, releasing the albums &quot;Terraform&quot; in 1998, &quot;1000 Hurts&quot; in 2000, and &quot;Excellent Italian Greyhound&quot; in 2007. In 2014, despite the considerable downsizing that Touch and Go had undergone, the band&#x27;s fifth LP, &quot;Dude Incredible&quot;, was released. Steve Albini went over each song on the album with Exclaim magazine.

A collection of the band&#x27;s two Peel Sessions from 1994 and 2004, entitled &quot;The End of Radio&quot; was released on June 14, 2019.

On March 20, 2024, the band announced a new record called &quot;To All Trains&quot;, to be released on May 17 via Touch and Go Records. On May 7, 2024, Albini died of a heart attack in his Chicago home, ten days before the scheduled release of &quot;To All Trains&quot;.

==Legacy==
Writing for Drowned in Sound, Benjamin Bland said that, &quot;Big Black and Shellac are surely the two most influential &#x27;noise rock&#x27; groups there have ever been. Hundreds of bands have sounded like them, and in all probability so will hundreds more. Who can blame them? When a shadow that large looms over an entire subgenre of music, it’s hard not to be influenced by it, let alone ignore it altogether.&quot;

John Robb, music critic and frontman of British post-punk band the Membranes, called Shellac &quot;the finest rock band on the planet. This is the rock band that the rest of us in our bands [...] have had to measure ourselves against and if we are found wanting then we have to cower behind rocks and attempt to revive our measly offerings until they measure up.&quot; Vish Khanna expanded on their influence, noting that &quot;[t]he band&#x27;s sense of empathy, great storytelling, interpersonal politics and black humour are not necessarily uncommon in post-punk noise-rock bands, but Shellac&#x27;s path is likely the most distinctive and emulated one.&quot; 

Christian Lembach of Whores called &quot;At Action Park&quot; his favorite noise rock album of all time. Mike Sullivan of Russian Circles cited the album as a major influence on his guitar-playing, noting that it &quot;literally changed the way [he] looked at music&quot;. The band has also been cited as an influence by Future Of The Left (who have been described with the moniker &quot;Poundland Shellac&quot;), Kurt Ballou of Converge, Mono, Swing Kids, Karin Dreijer of The Knife, Gilla Band, Black Country, New Road, Jehnny Beth of Savages, Silverchair, My Disco, Gengahr, Dredg, Suicide Dolls, Echo Is Your Love, The Futureheads, KEN Mode, and Pile.

Shellac was honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

Shellac were recognized as the &quot;House Band&quot; of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties (now defunct) and Primavera Sound festivals, which Albini saw as the exceptions to his general distaste of music festivals for exploiting the underground music scene. In Albini&#x27;s lifetime, Shellac performed at every edition of Primavera Sound since 2006, except for 2007. In 2018, the festival sold a shirt that read &quot;Shellac and 249 More&quot; in reference to its lineup. Following Albini&#x27;s death, the festival said in a statement honoring him, &quot;What are we going to do without you, Steve? After having welcomed them at 15 editions of the festival, it is impossible for us to imagine a Primavera Sound without him, because no band explains us better than Shellac.&quot; During the 2024 edition of Primavera Sound, there was a listening party of &quot;To All Trains&quot; during Shellac&#x27;s planned time slot which served as a memorial to Albini, and the festival renamed a stage for him in his honor.

<text>Iași ( , , ; also known by other alternative names), also referred to mostly historically as Jassy ( , ), is the third largest city in Romania and the seat of Iași County. Located in the historical region of Moldavia, it has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life. The city was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia from 1564 to 1859, then of the United Principalities from 1859 to 1862, and the capital of Romania from 1916 to 1918.

Known as the Cultural Capital of Romania Iași is a symbol of Romanian history. Historian Nicolae Iorga stated that &quot;there should be no Romanian who does not know of it&quot;. Still referred to as &quot;The Moldavian Capital&quot;, Iași is the main economic and business centre of Romania&#x27;s Moldavian region. In December 2018, Iași was officially declared the Historical Capital of Romania.

At the 2021 census, the city-proper had a population of 271,692, its metropolitan area had a population of 423,154, whereas more than 500,000 people live within its peri-urban area. Counting 500,668 residents (as of 2018), the Iași urban area is the second most populous in Romania after Bucharest. 

Home to the oldest Romanian university and to the first engineering school, Iași is the third most important education and research centre of the country, accommodating over 60,000 students in five public universities. The social and cultural life revolves around the Vasile Alecsandri National Theatre (the oldest in Romania), the Moldova State Philharmonic, the Opera House, the Iași Athenaeum, the Botanical Garden (the oldest and largest in Romania), the Central University Library (the oldest in Romania), the cultural centres and festivals, an array of museums, memorial houses, religious and historical monuments. The city is also known as the site of the largest Romanian pilgrimage which takes place every year, in October.

==Etymology and names==

Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name &quot;Iași&quot;. Some argue that the name originates with the Sarmatian tribe Iazyges (of Iranian origin), one mentioned by Ovid as and .

Other explanations show that the name originated from the Iranian Alanic tribe of Jassi, having the same origin with the Yazyges tribes Jassic people. In medieval times the Prut river was known as &quot;Alanus fluvius&quot; and the city as &quot;Forum Philistinorum&quot;. From this population derived the plural of the town name, &quot;Iașii&quot;.

Another historian wrote that the Iasians lived among the Cumans and that they left the Caucasus after the first Mongolian campaign in the West, settling temporarily near the Prut. He asserts that the ethnic name of Jasz which is given to the Iasians by the Hungarians has been erroneously identified with the Jazyges; also he shows that the word &quot;jasz&quot; is a Slavic loan word. The Hungarian name of the city (&quot;Jászvásár&quot;) literally means &quot;Jassic Market&quot;; the antiquated Romanian name, &quot;Târgul Ieșilor&quot; (and the once-favoured &quot;Iașii&quot;), and the German &quot;Jassenmarkt&quot;, may indicate the same meaning.

==History==


===Ancient times===
Archaeological investigations attest to the presence of human communities on the present territory of the city and around it as far back as the prehistoric age. Later settlements included those of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, a late Neolithic archaeological culture.

There is archaeological evidence of human settlements in the area of Iași dating from the 6th to 7th centuries (Curtea Domnească) and 7th to 10th centuries; these settlements contained rectangular houses with semicircular ovens. Also, many of the vessels (9th–11th centuries) found in Iași had a cross, potentially indicating that the inhabitants were Christians.

===Early development===
In 1396, Iași is mentioned by the German crusader Johann Schiltberger (a participant in the Battle of Nicopolis). The name of the city is first found in an official document in 1408. This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian Prince Alexander to the Polish merchants of Lvov. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first surviving written mention.

===Capital of Moldavia===
Around 1564, Prince Alexandru Lăpușneanu moved the Moldavian capital from Suceava to Iași. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a Lutheran church were founded by the Greek adventurer prince, Ioan Iacob Heraclid.

In 1640, Vasile Lupu established the first school in which the Romanian replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the Byzantine Trei Ierarhi Monastery (&quot;Monastery of the Three Hierarchs&quot;; built 1635–39). Between 15 September – 27 October 1642, the city hosted the Synod of Iași (also referred to as the Synod of Jassy). In 1643, the first volume ever printed in Moldavia was published in Iași.

The city was often burned down and looted by the Tatars (in 1513, 1574, 1577, 1593), by the Ottomans in 1538, the Cossacks and Tartars (1650), or the Poles (1620, 1686). In 1734, it was hit by the plague. The city was also affected by famine (1575, 1724, 1739–1740), or large local fires (1725, 1735, 1753, 1766, 1785), propagated by many buildings that were built on wooden structures.

It was through the Treaty of Jassy that the sixth Russo-Turkish War was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary manoeuvre and occupation under Alexander Ypsilanti (Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης) and the Filiki Eteria (Φιλική Εταιρία) (1821, at the beginning of the Greek War of Independence) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844 a severe fire affected much of the city.

===Mid–19th century to 20th century===

Between 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Iași and Bucharest were de facto capitals of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognised under the name of &quot;Romania&quot;, the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the constituent assembly voted 148,150 lei to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.

During World War I, Iași was the capital of a much reduced Romania for two years, following the Central Powers&#x27; occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of Imperial Germany and its allies in November 1918. In November–December 1918 Iași hosted the Jassy Conference.

===Jewish community===

Iași also figures prominently in Jewish history, with the first documented presence of Sephardi Jews from the late 16th century. The oldest tomb inscription in the local cemetery probably dates to 1610. By the mid-19th century, owing to widespread Russian Jewish and Galician Jewish immigration into Moldavia, the city was at least one-third Jewish, growing to 50% Jewish by 1899 according to the &quot;Great Geographic Dictionary of Romania&quot; cited by JewishGen. The Podu Roș Synagogue was built in Iași, circa 1810, by Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apta, but the synagogue became mostly Misnagdic not long thereafter. 
In 1855, Iași was the home of the first-ever Yiddish-language newspaper, &quot;Korot Haitim&quot;, and, in 1876, the site of what was arguably the first-ever professional Yiddish theatre performance, established by Avraham Goldfaden. The words of HaTikvah, the national anthem of Israel, were written in Iași by Naftali Herz Imber. Jewish musicians in Iași played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.

The first Zionist Hebrew-language newspaper in Romania, &quot;Emek Israel&quot;, was published in Iași in 1882. Zionist sports clubs, student associations and discussion groups were established in the city, most of which later merged into the Organizația Sionistă. The Hachshara Farms in Iași were a type of training farms to prepare young people for resettlement in the Palestine region.

According to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34% of the city&#x27;s population), Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Iași. There were over 127 synagogues. 
After World War II, in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Iași. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Iași and four synagogues were active.

Currently, Iași has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 Great Synagogue, is the oldest surviving synagogue in Romania and among the oldest synagogues still active in Europe. A 10-year restoration project funded by UNESCO, the Romanian Ministry of Culture and the local authorities of Iași restored it to its former glory, opening in time for Hanukkah on 4 December 2018.

===World War II===

During the war, while the full scale of the Holocaust remained generally unknown to the Allied Powers, the Iași pogrom stood as one of the known examples of Axis brutality toward the Jews. The pogrom lasted from 29 June to 6 July 1941, and over 13,266 people, or one third of the Jewish population, were massacred in the pogrom itself or in its aftermath, and many were deported. Particularly brutal was the massacre of Jews who were forced on sealed trains in the brutal summer heat. Over half of the occupants perished in these trains, which were aimlessly driven throughout the countryside with no particular destination.
In May 1944, the Iași area became the scene of ferocious fighting between Romanian-German forces and the advancing Soviet Red Army and the city was partially destroyed. The German Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; won a defensive victory at the Battle of Târgu Frumos, near Iași, which was the object of several NATO studies during the Cold War. By 20 August, Iași had been taken by Soviet forces.

Iași suffered heavy damage due to Soviet (June–July 1941, June 1944) and American (June 1944) airstrikes, respectively. The bombing of Soviet aviation and artillery on 20 August 1944, resulted in more than 5,000 civilian deaths and the destruction of two-thirds of the city.

===Post-World War II era===
Iași experienced a major wave of industrialisation, in 1955–1989. During this period of time, it received numerous migrants from rural regions, and the urban area expanded. In the Communist era, Iași saw a growth of 235% in population and 69% in area. The local systematization plans of the old city started in 1960 and continued in the 1970s and 1980s as part of the larger national systematization program; however, the urban planning was sometimes arbitrary and followed by dysfunctions. By 1989, Iași had become highly industrialised, with 108,000 employees (representing 47% of the total workforce) active in 46 large state-owned enterprises, in various industries: machine building and heavy equipment, chemical, textile, pharmaceutical, metallurgical, electronics, food, energy, building materials, furniture.

After the end of the Communist regime and the transition to a free market economy, the private sector has grown steadily, while much of the old industry (such as the industrial sector) gradually decayed.
==Geography==

===Topography===
Located in the North-East of Romania, at the contact between the Jijia Plain and the Bârlad Plateau, Iași used to be the crossroads place of the historic trade routes that passed through Moldavia coming from the Kingdom of Poland, Habsburg monarchy, Tsardom of Russia, and Constantinople.

The city lies on the Bahlui River valley, a tributary of the Jijia River (tributary of the Prut River). The surrounding country is one of uplands and woods, featuring monasteries and parks. Iași itself stands amid vineyards and gardens, partly on hills, partly in the in-between valley.

The central part of the city is located on the fluvial terrace of the Bahlui River (the so-called Palat Terrace). From this nucleus, the city evolved after the medieval times toward south and north on the Bahlui River floodplain and on the adjacent hills. The southern part of the city lies on the Iași Ridge () (the northernmost hill of the Bârlad Plateau). Considering the present day extension of the administrative boundaries, the city territory has an altitudinal extension of , between the 34.5 m a.s.l. (113.19 ft) in the Bahlui River floodplain, at the Holboca bridge, and 354.77 m a.s.l. (1,163.94 ft), at the edge of the Repedea Hill.

It is a common belief that Iași is built on seven hills (): Breazu, Bucium, Cetățuia, Copou, Galata, Repedea and Șorogari, thus triggering comparisons with Rome.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Iaşi falls within either a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;, near &quot;Dfb&quot;) if the isotherm is used, or a humid temperate climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) bordering on an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) if the isotherm is used. Iași experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm with temperatures sometimes exceeding while winters are cold and windy with moderate snowfall and temperatures at night sometimes dropping below .

Each year, around 14 October, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims gather to commemorate Saint Parascheva, while the city itself established its Celebration Days at the same time. The October pilgrimage is one of the largest in Europe, drawing people all over Romania as well as from neighboring Orthodox countries.

During the entire year, pilgrimages to Iași can also involve visits to a large number of religious sites, both within and around the city.

===Gardens, parks and natural landmarks===

Iași has a diverse array of public spaces, from city squares to public parks.

Begun in 1833, at the time when Iași was the capital of Moldavia, by Prince Mihail Sturdza and under the plans of Gheorghe Asachi and Mihail Singurov, Copou Park was integrated into the city and marks one of the first Romanian coordinated public parks. The oldest monument in Romania stands in the middle of the park, the (1834), a tall obelisk, dedicated to the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot;, the first law on political, administrative and juridical organisation in Romanian Principalities.

Founded in 1856, the Botanical Garden of Iași, the first botanical garden in Romania, has an area of over 100 hectares, and more than 10,000 species of plants.

Iași Exhibition Park was opened in 1923 and built under the co-ordination of the architect N. Ghica Budești.

The Ciric Park, located in the north-eastern part of Iași, consists of parkland and four lakes.

Eminescu&#x27;s Linden Tree () is a 500-year-old silver linden (&quot;Tilia tomentosa Moench&quot;) situated in Copou Park. Mihai Eminescu reportedly wrote some of his best works underneath this linden tree, rendering it one of Romania&#x27;s most important natural monuments and a notable Iași landmark. The , in Bucium neighbourhood, is another spot where Mihai Eminescu sought inspiration (the poem &quot;Down Where the Lonely Poplars Grow&quot;). In 1973, the 15 white poplars still left (with the age ranges between 233 and 371 years) were declared natural monuments.

Iași County has 387 centuries-old trees, of which 224 were declared monument trees and 160 got the Romanian Academy&#x27;s approval and are proposed for such a classification. Most of them are oak or linden trees. The oldest tree in the county is the 675-year-old hybrid linden (&quot;Tilia&quot;) tree located in the courtyard of Bârnova Monastery, in the vicinity of Iași. When the linden was about 57 years old and about in diameter, Iași was mentioned as an urban settlement, during the reign of Prince Alexander the Good (1408).

Iași is home to 14 public hospitals, including the , the second largest and one of the oldest in Romania (1755), St. Maria Clinic Children&#x27;s Hospital (one of the largest children&#x27;s hospitals in the country), Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Regional Oncology Institute, and (1905 – first psychiatric hospital in Romania). The public system is complemented by numerous private clinics.

In December 2021, the Ministry of Health signed the contract for the design of a new hospital that will serve the entire North-East region. The total investment in the construction of the Iași Regional Emergency Hospital (), with a completion date of 2027, is estimated at over 500 million euros.

===Air pollution concerns===
In 2014, the European Commission started environmental law infringement procedures against Romania, citing Bucharest, Iași, and Brașov cases as examples. In 2015, while the atmospheric particulate matter has repeatedly reached and exceeded legal thresholds for PM10, Iași came to be regarded as the city with the second worst air quality in Romania, after Bucharest. Pollution from vehicular traffic, construction works, and a lack of green spaces (the city only has about of public green spaces per capita) make up some of the reasons behind these problems.

<text>At Action Park is the debut studio album by American rock band Shellac, released in 1994.

==Packaging==
The release came in a folded and hand-pressed sleeve which is referred as &quot;uni-pak style album jacket&quot;. The inner sleeve shows artwork with four microphones, the record sleeve shows an illustration of a fictionalized map of Action Park on one side, and a lengthy medical text &quot;Resuscitation from apparent death by electric shock&quot; on the other side (the text was found in an old electronics textbook of Weston&#x27;s). The Vinyl had inscriptions in the run-out groove of both sides, reading: &quot;Smoking is as natural as breathing. They&#x27;ve been doing it since before I was born... ... which is a shame, because I could have invented it. - Todd Stanford Trainer 1994&quot;

==Reception==

The album received highly positive reviews on release. Greg Kot wrote that the &quot;music is still punishing in the extreme, with melody subservient to groove and dynamics, and the human voice just another instrument in a maelstrom&quot;, going on to write that &quot;Albini uses his guitar more for color and texture rather than as a lead instrument, while bassist Bob Weston and drummer Todd Trainer create a vicious spin-cycle groove, punctuated by thrilling ebbs and leaps in volume and tempo&quot; and called the engineering &quot;extraordinary&quot;. In &quot;Guitar World&quot;, David Grad wrote, &quot;The trio clearly view themselves as craftsmen, partners in a well-oiled machine, with Trainer and Weston generating the rhythmic line of attack with precision while Albini&#x27;s guitar responds with storm after storm of skittering sonic steel.&quot;

Retrospectively, AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming wrote that despite Albini&#x27;s continued obsession with &quot;sex, violence, and anti-social behavior&quot; from his Big Black days and while &quot;the hard, metallic guitar figures of &quot;Pull the Cup&quot; and &quot;Song of the Minerals&quot; were as uncompromisingly abrasive as ever&quot;, the album revealed &quot;a band more musically intelligent and imaginative&quot; than his former band.

In 2012, &quot;Fact&quot; ranked it the 18th best album of the 1990s, calling it &quot;brilliantly angular [...] Combining Minutemen-esque grooves that feel like they could last forever with spit-riddled, sneering vocals and a storming rhythm section, there are few albums that sound as simultaneously doomed and driven as &quot;At Action Park&quot;.&quot;

===Legacy===

Christian Lemach of Whores called &quot;At Action Park&quot; his favorite noise rock album of all time. Mike Sullivan of Russian Circles cited this album, alongside Fugazi&#x27;s &quot;Red Medicine&quot;, as major influences on his guitar-playing, noting that they &quot;literally changed the way [he] looked at music&quot;. Electronic producer Clark included the album among his favorites, noting that &quot;there&#x27;s almost a techno element to it, it feels blocky, like it&#x27;s made out of angles rather than anything circular, but still the production&#x27;s quite warm, it just draws you in.&quot;

<text>Steve Albini was an American musician, audio engineer, and music journalist, whose many recording projects have exerted an important influence on independent music since the 1980s. Most of his projects from 1997 onwards were recorded at the Electrical Audio studios in Chicago. Albini is occasionally credited as a record producer, though he disliked the term to describe his work, preferring the term &quot;recording engineer&quot; when credited, and refused to take royalties from bands recording in his studio, as he felt it would be unethical to do so.

As a musician, Albini fronted the bands Big Black, Rapeman, and Shellac on guitar and vocals. He also played on other projects from time to time, notably as a bass guitarist in the touring incarnation of Pete Conway&#x27;s solo project Flour whose records he also engineered.

The list is in chronological order by date of release, but is incomplete.

<doc id="215081" wikidata="Q869604" url="?curid=215081" title="Crazy Town">
<text>Crazy Town (sometimes abbreviated as CXT) was an American rap rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1995 by Bret &quot;Epic&quot; Mazur and Shifty Shellshock (Seth Brooks Binzer). Their 2000 single &quot;Butterfly&quot;, reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and helped their debut album, &quot;The Gift of Game&quot; (1999), sell over 1.6 million units. Their follow-up album, &quot;Darkhorse&quot; (2002), failed to achieve the same level of success, contributing to the band&#x27;s breakup in 2003.

Mazur and Binzer reformed the band in 2007 and released their third album, &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;, in 2015. In 2017, Mazur left the band and Binzer changed its name to Crazy Town X. In March 2024, the band released the EP &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot;. Binzer died in June 2024, leaving the future of the band unclear.

==History==
===Formation (1995–1999)===
Bret Mazur and Seth Binzer, who go by the names of Epic and Shifty Shellshock, respectively, started collaborating under the name of &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot; in 1995 in Los Angeles, along with Adam Bravin (a.k.a. DJ Adam 12) who preceded DJ AM. However, they did not become serious about releasing any material until much later. By early 1999, Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr. (a.k.a. JBJ), Doug Miller, Adam Goldstein (a.k.a. DJ AM), and Antonio Lorenzo &quot;Trouble&quot; Valli joined the band. Prior to joining the band, Bradley was the drummer for jazz trumpeter Chuck Mangione from 1977 to 1981, and had been a member of the alternative rock band Mary&#x27;s Danish in the early 1990s. Crazy Town&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;, was released in November 1999, having been recorded earlier that year.
===&quot;The Gift of Game&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; (1999–2001)===
The release of &quot;The Gift of Game&quot; was followed by a tour support slot for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Guitarist Rust Epique left the band while the album was being mixed, and Crazy Town was joined by Kraig Tyler shortly after. The first two singles from &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Darkside&quot;, were released but failed to chart.

In 2000, Crazy Town was signed to tour with Ozzfest; however, they were forced to withdraw after only two weeks when Binzer was arrested after he threw a chair through a window while he was drunk. Crazy Town then released their third single in 2001, &quot;Butterfly&quot; (which uses samples from Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Pretty Little Ditty&quot;). It reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Soundscan reports 100,000 album sales of &quot;The Gift of Game&quot; prior to the release of &quot;Butterfly&quot;; after &quot;Butterfly&quot; reached number 1, sales exceeded 1.5 million.

Crazy Town toured with Ozzfest in 2001. They were received with mixed reviews; many people in the Ozzfest crowd mockingly called them &quot;The Butterfly Boys&quot;. A fourth single, &quot;Revolving Door&quot;, was released with limited success. In 2001 Crazy Town also made a cameo appearance in the music video for &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot; by P. Diddy, Black Rob and Mark Curry.

===&quot;Darkhorse&quot; (2001–2003)===
Their second album, &quot;Darkhorse&quot;, was produced by Howard Benson and released on November 12, 2002. Benson&#x27;s influence resulted in a more rock-oriented sound. Prior to recording the album, drummer James Bradley Jr. eventually left the band and was replaced by Kyle Hollinger. The album achieved little commercial success, spawning only two singles: &quot;Drowning&quot;, which became a minor hit in the U.S., UK, Austria, and Germany, and &quot;Hurt You So Bad&quot;, which failed to chart at all. Shortly after the release of &quot;Darkhorse&quot; the band broke up in 2003, citing amongst other things, pressure from their record company for a &quot;Butterfly&quot; follow-up.

===Hiatus (2003–2007)===
During Crazy Town&#x27;s hiatus, Bret Mazur went on to form &quot;The Pharmacy&quot;, a record-producing company. Shortly after leaving Crazy Town, Rust Epique formed a band which would eventually go by the name pre)Thing. He died of a heart attack shortly before their debut album &quot;22nd Century Lifestyle&quot; was released in 2004. Binzer contributed vocals to Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s 2002 single &quot;Starry Eyed Surprise&quot;. He released his first solo album in 2004, &quot;Happy Love Sick&quot;, under his alias Shifty Shellshock. Kraig Tyler joined Eric Powell&#x27;s industrial band &quot;16Volt&quot;.

===Reformation (2007–2011)===
In late 2007, Crazy Town announced that the remaining members had reformed and were working on a new studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Crazy Town is Back&quot;, which would be released sometime in 2008, though no such release was ever made. On August 26, 2009, Crazy Town performed at Les Deux, in Hollywood, California, on stage together for the first time in five years. On August 28, 2009, former member DJ AM was found dead in his apartment, of an accidental drug overdose. On August 7, 2010, Crazy Town played together at the festival &quot;SRH FEST 2010&quot; in California. Throughout 2011, Crazy Town released a new song, &quot;My Place&quot;, on YouTube, as well as two new songs, &quot;Hard to Get&quot; and &quot;Hit That Switch&quot;, on their Myspace page.

===&quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot; (2013–2017)===
In 2013, Shifty and Epic said that Crazy Town were in the studio recording a new album, entitled &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;. On December 18, 2014, Crazy Town released their first official single from the album, &quot;Megatron&quot;. The song was used as the theme song for &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; during its run on Destination America in 2015.

&quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot; was released on August 28, 2015. DJ AM appears as a featured artist on the track &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot;, which was released as a single in August 2015. In 2016, lead guitarist Elias Tannous was added to the lineup and from August till October 2016, the band toured with the Make America Rock Again concert, alongside other artists who had success throughout the 2000s. Throughout the tour, Epic would perform and was temporarily replaced by Bobby Reeves, an ex-vocalist of Adema.

===Mazur&#x27;s departure, lineup change, &quot;Crazy Town X&quot; and Binzer&#x27;s death (2017–2024)===
In January 2017, after a year of hiatus from the band, Epic announced through his Facebook post that he will no longer tour with the band. Epic intended to still be involved with Crazy Town, though not as a band member. Shifty decided to add an &quot;X&quot; next to the band&#x27;s name. When asked about the letter&#x27;s significance on their Instagram account, the band stated &quot;the X is used by gangs to symbolize a territory that has just been won&quot;.

On November 3, 2019, Crazy Town&#x27;s van, carrying Binzer and band members Elias Tannous and Roland Banks, crashed into a moose during a tour stop in Ontario, Canada. All three were treated for bruises and cuts at the hospital.

Crazy Town were kicked off a 2023 tour with Hed PE after a bloody fight between Binzer and Reeves outside a venue in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Crazy Town released an EP titled &quot;Flirting With Disaster&quot; in March 2024. At the time, Crazy Town&#x27;s members were Binzer, Mark White, Rick Dixon and Sean Heenan.

On June 24, 2024, Binzer was found dead in his home from an accidental drug overdose.

==Musical style and legacy==
&quot;Billboard&quot; categorized Crazy Town as a rock and hip hop band. The band described themselves as &quot;hip-hop kids who needed a bit of rock in their sound&quot;, instead of a rock band that added hip hop to their sound, reflecting the band members&#x27; background working in Los Angeles hip hop. The band fused &quot;hip-hop&#x27;s lyrical attitude and rhythmic sass with the muscle of live rock instrumentation.&quot; They developed their rap rock sound in the Los Angeles underground music scene, anticipating nu metal. According to &quot;AllMusic&quot;, &quot;Crazy Town&#x27;s music and image reflected one of the most dynamic and volatile sociocultural environments on the planet—Los Angeles—where the urban squalor of the South Central district exists just minutes away from the glitz of Beverly Hills.&quot; The band&#x27;s influences include N.W.A, Cypress Hill, Ice-T and the Cure. Crazy Town&#x27;s music is defined by &quot;pronged rapping [...] urban angst/street-fighting, bitch-bonking [lyrics]&quot; which are &quot;punctuated [with] bone-crushing [...] guitar riffs.&quot; Due to looking more like a hip hop crew than a metal band, Crazy Town inspired more ire from metal purists than any other rap rock group. It was commonly perceived that the band&#x27;s target audience was 13-year-old boys &quot;vicariously living out their fantasies of being a bad-ass tattooed pimp&quot; through the band&#x27;s rap lyrics.

About the band&#x27;s lyrics, Shifty Shellshock said: &quot;We&#x27;re just having a good time. We&#x27;re not like political or anything. I can be very sarcastic just like a little punk, we talk a lot of trash. We have some points, like &#x27;learn from your mistakes&#x27;, &#x27;check yourself&#x27;, you know, &#x27;don&#x27;t get taken advantage of&#x27;. Real simple things, nothing too overwhelming&quot;.

Although they were best known for having a rap metal sound, their biggest hit, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, had a hip hop sound. Reporting on the song&#x27;s success in 2001, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; wrote, &quot;The song, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart last month, was one of those welcome surprises: a deft blend of hip-hop and rock that didn&#x27;t sound like Red Bull-fueled &#x27;roid rage. Built around a sample of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &#x27;Pretty Little Ditty,&#x27; &#x27;Butterfly&#x27; was hard enough to please the Bizkit eaters but smooth enough to seduce pop fans.&quot; Their third album, &quot;The Brimstone Sluggers&quot;, saw the band displaying an alternative hip hop sound reflective of their musical roots.

About the band&#x27;s legacy in nu metal, &quot;I&#x27;m Music Magazine&quot; said: &quot;Crazy Town is often only thought of as a &#x27;one hit wonder&#x27; by way too many people. The band has never truly received the credit that they deserve for their influence on the nu metal scene&quot;.

<doc id="215082" wikidata="Q1932047" url="?curid=215082" title="1000 Hurts">
<text>1000 Hurts is the third studio album by American rock band Shellac, released on August 8, 2000. In its official promotional materials Shellac jokingly described this album as follows: &quot;There are no 12-minute songs on this one. This record is more mean-spirited. Todd sings.&quot;

The cover is a clear homage to old Ampex audio recording tape boxes. The band are known for using analog tape for their recordings, and are fans of Ampex tape and tape recorders. Also, the speech at the start of the record is a variation on the announcements one would hear on Magnetic Reference Laboratory&#x27;s calibration tapes for analog tape recorders. The title refers to one-thousand Hertz (rendered 1000 Hz), a measure used in audio recording describing a sine wave cycling 1,000 times per second.

The album was named &quot;Rockfeedback&quot; magazine&#x27;s record of the decade. Jehnny Beth of Savages-fame named the album one of her biggest influences, saying that it had made her &quot;want to be a bassist&quot; &amp; inspired her ideas of recording music.

<doc id="215087" wikidata="Q282256" url="?curid=215087" title="Rufous treepie">
<text>The rufous treepie (Dendrocitta vagabunda) is a treepie, native to the Indian Subcontinent and adjoining parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the crow family, Corvidae. It is long tailed and has loud musical calls making it very conspicuous. It is found commonly in open scrub, agricultural areas, forests as well as urban gardens. Like other corvids it is very adaptable, omnivorous and opportunistic in feeding.

==Description==
The sexes are alike and the main colour of the body is cinnamon with a black head and the long graduated tail is bluish grey and is tipped in black. The wing has a white patch. The only confusable species is the grey treepie which however lacks the bright rufous mantle. The bill is stout with a hooked tip. The underparts and lower back are a warm tawny-brown to orange-brown in colour with white wing coverts and black primaries. The bill, legs and feet are black.

The widespread populations show variations and several subspecies are recognized. The nominate subspecies is found in the northeastern part of peninsular India south to Hyderabad. The desert form is paler and called &quot;pallida&quot;, &quot;vernayi&quot; of the Eastern Ghats is brighter while &quot;parvula&quot; of the Western Ghats is smaller in size. The form in Afghanistan and Pakistan is &quot;bristoli&quot; while the form in southern Thailand is &quot;saturatior&quot;. E. C. Stuart Baker describes &quot;sclateri&quot; from the upper Chindwin to the Chin Hills and &quot;kinneari&quot; from southern Myanmar and northwest Thailand. The population in eastern Thailand an Indochina is &quot;sakeratensis&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the rufous treepie is quite large, covering Pakistan, India and into Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. It inhabits open forest consisting of scrub, plantations and gardens. In the Garhwal Himalayas, it migrates seasonally between different elevations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The rufous treepie is primarily an arboreal omnivore feeding on fruits, nectar (of &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;) seeds, invertebrates, small reptiles and the eggs and young of birds; it has also been known to take flesh from recently killed carcasses. It is an agile forager, clinging and clambering through the branches and sometimes joining mixed hunting parties along with species such as drongos and babblers. They are known to be a cleaning symbiont of deer, feeding on ectoparasites of sambar which permit them to perch and position themselves to invite the birds to examine specific parts. Like many other corvids, it caches food. It is considered to be beneficial to palm cultivation in southern India due to its foraging on the grubs of the destructive weevil &quot;Rhynchophorus ferrugineus&quot;. Its feeds on the fruits of &quot;Trichosanthes tricuspidata&quot; which are toxic to mammals.

The breeding season in India is April to June. In Bengal, the peak is in April and May with heightened levels of pineal gland activity and serotonin production. It builds its shallow nest in trees and bushes and usually lays 3-5 eggs.

The rufous treepie has a wide repertoire of calls, but a &quot;bob-o-link&quot; or &quot;ko-tree&quot; call is most common. A local name for this bird &quot;kotri&quot; is derived from the typical call while other names include &quot;Handi Chancha&quot; and &quot;taka chor&quot; (=&quot;coin thief&quot;).

A blood parasitic protozoan &quot;Trypanosoma corvi&quot; and &quot;Babesia&quot; has been reported from this species. Trematode parasites, &quot;Haplorchis vagabundi&quot;, have been found in their intestines. An acanthocephalan parasite &quot;Centrorhynchus lancea&quot; is also known. A species of quill mite &quot;Syringophiloidus dendrocittae&quot; is known to live in the feathers of rufous treepies.

<text>This is a list of members of the Swiss Federal Council, in chronological order and for any given year since inauguration of the Federal Council, from 1848 to present. Its seven members constitute the federal government of Switzerland and collectively serve as the country&#x27;s head of state. Each of the seven Federal Councillors heads a department of the Swiss federal administration.

The members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the federal parliament sitting together as the United Federal Assembly. Each Federal Councillor is elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of votes. Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a motion of no confidence nor can they be impeached. Reelection is possible for an indefinite number of terms. Parliament has decided not to reelect a sitting Federal Councillor only four times and only twice (in 2003 and 2007) since 1872. In practice, therefore, Federal Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.

<text>Luz Esther Benítez Rosado (born July 22, 1942), also known as Lucecita, is a Puerto Rican singer, part of the country&#x27;s new wave popular music. Born in Bayamon, a large city in Puerto Rico, she participated in amateur radio shows.

Benítez&#x27;s most important career step came in 1969, when she won the &quot;Festival de la Cancion Latina&quot; (&quot;Festival of the Latin Song&quot;) in Mexico. She participated with two songs, &quot;Génesis&quot; by G.V. Lloveras and &quot;Energía de mis manos&quot;, by M. de Jesús. &quot;Genesis&quot; received the highest points (223) in the festival and Lucecita also won as best dressed performer. Pedro Rivera Toledo&#x27;s arrangement of Genesis also won as the best arrangement, although the orchestra was conducted by Jose S. Marroquin. The festival was held at the Teatro Ferrocarrilero in Mexico.

<text>Phoebe ( ) is the most massive irregular satellite of Saturn with a mean diameter of . It was discovered by William Henry Pickering on 18 March 1899&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtizLyfe/Charlie Kovas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from photographic plates that had been taken by DeLisle Stewart starting on 16 August 1898 at the Boyden Station of the Carmen Alto Observatory near Arequipa, Peru. It was the first natural satellite to be discovered photographically.

Phoebe was the first target encountered upon the arrival of the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft in the Saturn system in 2004, and is thus unusually well-studied for an irregular moon of its size. &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s trajectory to Saturn and time of arrival were specifically chosen to permit this flyby. After the encounter and its insertion into orbit, &quot;Cassini&quot; did not go much beyond the orbit of Iapetus.

Phoebe is roughly spherical and has a differentiated interior. It was spherical and hot early in its history and was battered out of roundness by repeated impacts. There is some evidence that it may be a captured centaur that originated in the Kuiper belt. Phoebe is the second-largest retrograde satellite in the Solar System after Triton.

==History==
===Discovery===

Phoebe was discovered by William Henry Pickering on 18 March 1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on 16 August 1898 at the Boyden Observatory near Arequipa, Peru, by DeLisle Stewart. It was the first satellite to be discovered photographically.

===Naming===
Phoebe is named after Phoebe, a Titaness in Greek mythology associated with the Moon, who was the sister of Cronus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Saturn). It is also designated Saturn IX in some scientific literature. The IAU nomenclature standards have stated that features on Phoebe are to be named after characters in the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts. In 2005, the IAU officially named 24 craters (see Named features).

Toby Owen of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, chairman of the International Astronomical Union Outer Solar System Task Group said:

==Orbit==

Phoebe&#x27;s orbit is retrograde; that is, it orbits Saturn opposite to Saturn&#x27;s rotation. For more than 100 years, Phoebe was Saturn&#x27;s outermost known moon, until the discovery of several smaller moons in 2000. Phoebe is almost 4 times more distant from Saturn than its nearest major neighbor (Iapetus), and is substantially larger than any of the other moons orbiting planets at comparable distances.

All of Saturn&#x27;s regular moons except Iapetus orbit very nearly in the plane of Saturn&#x27;s equator. The outer irregular satellites follow moderately to highly eccentric orbits, and none are expected to rotate synchronously as all the inner moons of Saturn do (except for Hyperion).

Phoebe may form its own subgroup along with two other satellites with similar orbits, S/2006 S 20 and S/2006 S 9.

===Phoebe ring===
The Phoebe ring is one of the rings of Saturn. This ring is tilted 27 degrees from Saturn&#x27;s equatorial plane (and the other rings). It extends from at least 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn; Phoebe orbits the planet at an average distance of 215 Saturn radii. The ring is about 40 times as thick as the diameter of the planet. Because the ring&#x27;s particles are presumed to have originated from micrometeoroid impacts on Phoebe, they should share its retrograde orbit, which is opposite to the orbital motion of the next inner moon, Iapetus. Inwardly migrating ring material would thus strike Iapetus&#x27;s leading hemisphere, contributing to its two-tone coloration. Although very large, the ring is virtually invisible—it was discovered using NASA&#x27;s infrared Spitzer Space Telescope.

Material displaced from Phoebe&#x27;s surface by microscopic meteor impacts may be responsible for the dark areas on the surface of Hyperion. Debris from the biggest impacts may be the origin of the other moons of Phoebe&#x27;s group (the Norse group)—all of which are less than 10 km in radius.

==Physical characteristics==

Phoebe is roughly spherical and has a diameter of (), approximately one-sixteenth that of the Moon. It is Saturn&#x27;s ninth-largest moon, but it is the eighth-most massive. Hyperion, another one of Saturn&#x27;s moons, has a larger radius, but is less massive than Phoebe. Phoebe rotates every nine hours and 16 minutes, and completes a full orbit around Saturn in about 18 months. Its surface temperature is on average .

Most of Saturn&#x27;s inner moons have very bright surfaces, but Phoebe&#x27;s albedo is much lower in comparison (), though relatively bright compared to other irregular moons with measured albedos. The Phoebean surface is heavily scarred. The largest crater, Jason, is roughly 100 km in diameter.

Phoebe&#x27;s dark coloring initially led to scientists surmising that it was a captured asteroid, as it resembled the common class of dark carbonaceous asteroids. These are chemically very primitive and are thought to be composed of original solids that condensed out of the solar nebula with little modification since then.

However, images from &quot;Cassini&quot; indicate that Phoebe&#x27;s craters show a considerable variation in brightness, which indicate the presence of large quantities of ice below a relatively thin blanket of dark surface deposits some thick. In addition, quantities of carbon dioxide have been detected on the surface, a finding that has never been replicated for an asteroid. It is estimated that Phoebe is about 50% rock, as opposed to the 35% or so that typifies Saturn&#x27;s inner moons. For these reasons, scientists are coming to think that Phoebe is in fact a captured centaur, one of a number of icy planetoids from the Kuiper belt that orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune. Phoebe is the first such object to be imaged as anything other than a dot.

Despite its small size, Phoebe is thought to have been a spherical body early in its history, with a differentiated interior, before solidifying and being battered into its current, slightly non-equilibrium shape.

===Named features===
Apart from one regio named after Phoebe&#x27;s daughter, Leto, all named features are craters named after characters from the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts.

===Maps===
==Formation==
Phoebe formed in the Kuiper belt within three million years after the origin of the Solar System. This was early enough that sufficient radioactive material was available to melt it into a sphere and stay warm enough to have liquid water for tens of millions of years.

==Observation and exploration==
Unlike Saturn&#x27;s other moons, Phoebe was not favorably placed for the &quot;Voyager&quot; probes. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observed Phoebe for a few hours in September 1981. In the images, taken from a distance of 2.2 million kilometres at low phase angle, the size of Phoebe was approximately 11 pixels and showed bright spots on the otherwise dark surface.

&quot;Cassini&quot; passed from Phoebe on 11 June 2004, returning many high-resolution images, which revealed a scarred surface. Because &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had not been able to produce any high-quality images of Phoebe, obtaining them was a priority for the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission and its flight path was deliberately designed to take it close by; otherwise, &quot;Cassini&quot; would likely not have returned images much better than &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s. Because of Phoebe&#x27;s short rotation period of approximately 9 hours, 17 minutes, &quot;Cassini&quot; was able to map virtually the entire surface of Phoebe. The close fly-by enabled the mass of Phoebe to be determined with an uncertainty of only 1 in 500.

<text>George William Littler Garrett (4 July 1852 – 26 February 1902) was a British clergyman and inventor who pioneered submarine design.

==Early life==
He was brought up in Moss Side in Manchester, Lancashire, England, the son of an Irish-born Church of England curate. He attended Rossall School near Fleetwood and then Manchester Grammar School, then studied Chemistry and General Science at Owens College (also in Manchester) before attending Trinity College, Dublin. He was appointed assistant master at the Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute and subsequently obtained a BA degree.

In 1873, he passed the Cambridge Theological Examination and became a curate in his father&#x27;s parish.

==Inventions==

He invented a diving suit in 1877, demonstrating it to the French government in the River Seine.

An interest in the possible military application of what at the time were known as submarine boats prompted him to form the Garrett Submarine Navigation and Pneumatophore Company Limited and raise £10,000 through it from Manchester businessmen. (A pneumatophore was a device for removing carbon dioxide from the air).

In 1878, he built a long hand-cranked submarine of about 4.5 tons, which he named the &quot;Resurgam&quot;. This was followed by the second (and more famous) &quot;Resurgam&quot; of 1879. It was long, displaced about 30 tons on the surface and 38 tons submerged and was powered by steam - the furnace and chimney being shut off before diving. The &quot;Resurgam&quot; was built by Cochran and Co in Birkenhead, Merseyside, 

It was not very practical - the boiler full of superheated water made conditions inside the submarine very hot indeed, and in common with many early submarine inventors he had not overcome the problems of longitudinal stability.

Nevertheless, although the submarine was lost whilst under tow in 1880 near Rhyl on its way to trials in Portsmouth for the Royal Navy, it impressed the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt sufficiently to finance him.

Together, they built a submarine for Greece and two for Turkey - Garrett was commissioned as a Commander in the Imperial Ottoman Navy for carrying out trials in these submarines. All of them suffered from severe stability problems. A further submarine was built for Russia but ran aground off Jutland on the way there and the Russians refused to pay for it.

==Final years==
After this, Nordenfelt and Garrett parted company. Garrett emigrated to the United States, where he lost his savings in a failed farm in Florida. He then joined the United States Army Corps of Engineers and was promoted to corporal. He became a U.S. citizen and died in New York City in 1902 aged 49.

<text>The preterite or preterit ( ; abbreviated &#x27; or &#x27;) is a grammatical tense or verb form serving to denote events that took place or were completed in the past; in some languages, such as Spanish, French, and English, it is equivalent to the [[simple past]] tense. In general, it combines the perfective aspect (event viewed as a single whole; it is not to be confused with the similarly named perfect) with the past tense and may thus also be termed the &quot;perfective past&quot;. In grammars of particular languages the preterite is sometimes called the &quot;past historic&quot;, or (particularly in the Greek grammatical tradition) the &quot;aorist&quot;.
When the term &quot;preterite&quot; is used in relation to specific languages, it may not correspond precisely to this definition. In English it can be used to refer to the simple past verb form, which sometimes (but not always) expresses perfective aspect. The case of German is similar: the &quot;Präteritum&quot; is the simple (non-compound) past tense, which does not always imply perfective aspect, and is anyway often replaced by the &quot;Perfekt&quot; (compound past) even in perfective past meanings.

Preterite may be denoted by the glossing abbreviation or . The word derives from the Latin &quot;praeteritum&quot; (the perfective participle of &quot;praetereo&quot;), meaning &quot;passed by&quot; or &quot;past.&quot;

==Romance languages==
===Latin===
In Latin, the perfect tense most commonly functions as the preterite, and refers to an action &quot;completed&quot; in the past. If the past action was not completed, one would use the imperfect. The perfect in Latin also functions in other circumstances as a present perfect.

Typical conjugation:
&quot;Dūxī&quot; can be translated as (preterite) &quot;I led&quot;, &quot;I did lead&quot;, or (in the present perfect) &quot;I have led.&quot;

A pronoun subject is often omitted, and usually used for emphasis.

===French===
In French, the preterite is known as &quot;le passé simple&quot; (the simple past). It is a past tense that indicates an action taken once in the past that was completed at some point in the past (translated: &quot;&lt;verb&gt;ed&quot;). This is as opposed to the imperfect (&quot;l&#x27;imparfait&quot;), used in expressing repeated, continual, or habitual past actions (often corresponding to English&#x27;s past continuous &quot;was/were &lt;verb&gt;ing&quot; or habitual &quot;used to &lt;verb&gt;&quot;). In the spoken language, the compound tense known as &quot;le passé composé&quot; (&quot;the compound past&quot;) began to compete with it from the 12th century onwards, and has since replaced it almost entirely. French simple past is mostly used in a narrative way to tell stories and describe successive actions. Novelists use it commonly: it brings more suspense, as the sentence can be short without any temporal reference needed. In oral language, the simple past is rarely used except while telling a story; therefore, it would be atypical to hear it in a standard discussion.

Typical conjugations:
===Romanian===

In Romanian, the preterite is known as &quot;perfectul simplu&quot; (literally, the simple past or simple perfect). The preterite indicates a past accomplished action (translated: &quot;verbed&quot;); however, this tense is not frequent in the official language and not frequent in the standard speech (not used in Republic of Moldova and not used in the Romanian regions of Transylvania, Muntenia and Moldova). The general tendency is to use the compound past (&quot;perfectul compus&quot;) to express a past action that is perceived as completed at the moment of speaking. 

Simple past is still actively used in current speech in the southwestern part of Romania, especially in Oltenia, but also in Banat, Crișana and Maramureș, mostly in rural areas. Usage of the preterite is very frequent in written narrative discourse, the simple past of the speech verbs being generally after a dialogue line in narration:

*&quot;Aici avem o crimă!, zise polițistul.&quot; This is a murder! said the policeman.

When used in everyday speech in standard Romanian, the preterite is used with the value of recent past, a recently completed action:
*&quot;Tocmai îl auzii pe George la radio.&quot; I have just heard George on the radio.

The second person is often used in questions about finishing an action in progress that is supposed to be over, giving the question a more informal tone:
*&quot;Gata, citirăți?&quot; Are you done, have you read [the texts]?

The forms of the simple perfect are made of an unstressed stem of the infinitive, a stressed suffix that is different in each group of verbs, and the endings &quot;-i, -și, -∅, -răm, -răți, -ră&quot;, which are the same for all the verbs:
===Italian===

In Italian, the preterite is called &quot;passato remoto&quot; (literally &quot;remote past&quot;). It is a past tense that indicates an action taken once and completed far in the past (&quot;mangiai&quot;, &quot;I ate&quot;). This is opposed to the &quot;imperfetto&quot; tense, which refers to a repeated, continuous, or habitual past action (&quot;mangiavo&quot;, &quot;I was eating&quot; or &quot;I used to eat&quot;) and to the &quot;passato prossimo&quot; (literally &quot;close past&quot;), which refers to an action completed recently (&quot;ho mangiato&quot;, &quot;I have eaten&quot;).

In colloquial usage, the use of the &quot;passato remoto&quot; becomes more prevalent going from the North to the South of Italy. While Northern Italians and Sardinians use &quot;passato prossimo&quot; in any perfective situation, Southern Italians will use &quot;passato remoto&quot; even for recent events.

Typical conjugations:
*Many -ere verbs in Italian have stem alternations in the 1st person singular, 3rd person singular and 3rd person plural. Some verbs (with d/t in their stem, including credere) also have endings -etti (1st person singular), -ette (3rd person singular), and -ettero (3rd person plural). Additionally, unlike in most languages, the third person plural is stressed on the irregular root. (Posero is stressed on the first syllable (POH-se-ro), not the second syllable (poh-SEH-ro).)

In a few remarkable cases, all three options exist for a single verb, although usage of each of these forms may vary. For &quot;perdere&quot; for example, the first person singular can occur as &quot;persi&quot; (irregular and most correct form), &quot;perdei&quot; or &quot;perdetti&quot; (compare to the past participle which can be &quot;perso&quot; (irregular, most correct) or &quot;perduto&quot; (regular)).

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese, the preterite is the &quot;pretérito perfeito&quot;. The Portuguese preterite has the same form as the Spanish preterite, but the meaning is like the &quot;composed past&quot; of French and Italian in that, for example, &quot;corri&quot; means both &quot;I ran&quot; and &quot;I have run.&quot; As in other Romance languages, it is opposed to the &quot;pretérito imperfeito&quot; (imperfect). Note that there does exist a &quot;pretérito perfeito composto&quot; (present perfect) but its meaning is not that of a perfect; instead it shows an iterative aspect. For example, &quot;tenho corrido&quot; does &quot;not&quot; mean &quot;I have run&quot; but rather &quot;I&#x27;ve been running.&quot;

Typical conjugations:

Some verbs change the stressed vowel in their preterite root in the third person singular to prevent confusion between it and the first person singular, like &quot;dizer&quot; (&quot;eu disse&quot; versus &quot;Você/ele/ela desse&quot;) and &quot;poder&quot; (&quot;eu pude&quot; versus &quot;Você/ele/ela pôde&quot;). Certain other verbs also use only the root in the first and third person singulars, such as &quot;pôr&quot; (&quot;eu pus&quot;, &quot;Você/ele/ela pôs&quot;).

===Spanish===
In Spanish, the preterite (&quot;pretérito perfecto simple,&quot; or &quot;pretérito indefinido&quot;) is a verb tense that indicates that an action taken once in the past was completed at a specific point in time in the past. (Traditional Spanish terminology calls all past tenses &quot;pretéritos&quot;, irrespective of whether they express completed or incomplete actions or events.) Usually, a definite start time or end time for the action is stated. This is opposed to the imperfect, which refers to any repeated, continuous, or habitual past action. Thus, &quot;I ran five miles yesterday&quot; would use the first-person preterite form of ran, &quot;corrí&quot;, whereas &quot;I ran five miles every morning&quot; would use the first-person imperfect form, &quot;corría&quot;. This distinction is actually one of perfective vs. imperfective aspect.

The special spellings for the &quot;yo&quot; form of the preterite are listed below (the accent mark goes over the &#x27;e&#x27;); these are needed to keep their respective sounds.
*-gar verbs: -gué (jugar&gt;jugué)
*-car verbs: -qué (buscar&gt;busqué)
*-zar verbs: -cé (almorzar&gt;almorcé)
*-guar verbs: -güé (aguar&gt;agüé)

The endings for -er and -ir verbs are identical.

The third person singular and plural forms of all verbs ending in -uir and -oír, as well as some verbs ending in -aer (excluding traer), end in -yó and -yeron, respectively; these are needed to keep their respective sounds.

Examples of verbs that have anomalous stems in the preterite include most verbs ending in -ducir as well as most verbs that are irregular in the &quot;yo&quot; form of the present tense (including traer).

In most Iberian Mainland Spanish and, to a lesser extent, Mexican Spanish, there is still a strong distinction between the preterite and the present perfect. The preterite denotes an action that began and ended in the past, while the present perfect denotes an action that began in the past and is over; thus,

*Comí todo el día. (I ate all day long.)
*He comido todo el día (I have eaten all day.)

In most other variants of Spanish, such as in the Americas and in the Canary Islands, this distinction has tended to fade, with the preterite being used even for actions in the immediate pre-present with continuing relevance.

Typical conjugations:

==Germanic languages==
In Germanic languages, the term &quot;preterite&quot; is sometimes used for the past tense.

===English===

The majority of English&#x27;s preterites (often called &quot;simple past&quot; or just &quot;past tense&quot;) are formed by adding &quot;-ed&quot; or &quot;-d&quot; to the verb&#x27;s plain form (bare infinitive), sometimes with spelling modifications. This is the result of the conjugation system of weak verbs, already in the majority in Old English, being raised to paradigmatic status and even taking over earlier conjugations of some old strong verbs. As a result, all newly introduced verbs have the weak conjugation. Examples:

* He planted corn and oats.
* They studied grammar.
* She shoved the Viking aside. (Original preterite &quot;scēaf&quot;, from an Old English strong verb.)
* I friended him on social media. (A verb with a weak preterite.)

A number of English verbs form their preterites by suppletion, a result of either ablaut, a regular set of sound changes (to an interior vowel) in the conjugation of a strong verb, or because the verb conjugations are the remains of a more complex system of tenses in irregular verbs:

* She went to the cinema. (Preterite of &quot;go&quot;; uses a completely different verb - the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;wendan&#x27; from which comes &#x27;to wend&#x27;.)
* I ate breakfast late this morning. (Preterite of &quot;eat.&quot;)
* He ran to the store. (Preterite of &quot;run.&quot;)

With the exception of &quot;to be&quot; and auxiliary and modal verbs, interrogative and negative clauses do not use their main verbs&#x27; preterites; if their declarative or positive counterpart does not use any auxiliary or modal verb, then the auxiliary verb &quot;did&quot; (the preterite of &quot;do&quot;) is inserted and the main verb appears in its plain form, as an infinitive:

* Was she busy today?
* He was not there.
* Could she play the piano when she was ten?
* The editor had not read the book yet.
* Did he plant corn and oats?
* She did not go to the cinema.

For more details, see English verbs, Simple past, and Uses of English verb forms.

===German===
German has a grammatical distinction between preterite (&quot;Präteritum&quot;) and perfect (&quot;Perfekt&quot;). (Older grammar books sometimes use &quot;Imperfekt&quot; instead of &quot;Präteritum&quot;, a borrowing from Latin terminology.) Originally the distinction was as strong as in English: The Präteritum was the standard, most neutral form for past actions, and could also express an event in the remote past, contrasting with the &quot;Perfekt&quot;, which expressed an event that has consequences reaching into the present.
* Präteritum: &quot;Es regnete.&quot; &quot;It rained. / It was raining.&quot; (I am talking about a past event.)
* Perfekt: &quot;Es hat geregnet.&quot; &quot;It has rained.&quot; (The street is still wet.)

In modern German, however, these tenses no longer reflect any distinction in aspect (&quot;Es hat geregnet&quot; means both rained/was raining), which parallels this lack of distinction in the present, which has no separate verb form for the present progressive (&quot;Es regnet&quot;: It rains, it is raining). The Präteritum now has the meaning of a narrative tense, i.e. a tense used primarily for describing connected past actions (e.g. as part of a story), and is used most often in formal writing and in literature.

Typical conjugations with the word &quot;sein&quot; (be) are:
For example, in spoken Upper German (in South Germany, Austria and Switzerland), beyond the auxiliary verbs &quot;sein&quot; (to be), &quot;werden&quot; (to become), &quot;können&quot; (to be able), &quot;wollen&quot; (to want), &quot;haben&quot; (to have), the Präteritum is rarely used in the spoken language and informal writing, though the grammatical form is fundamental to producing the subjunctive and conditional forms, while compound verb conjugations are used instead. Yiddish has gone even further and has no preterite at all. Rather, there is only one past tense, which is formed using what was originally perfect. The dialect of German spoken in North America known as Pennsylvania German has also undergone this change with the exception of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; which still retains a simple past.

The Alemannic German has also largely lost the preterite form. The only exception were the speakers of the isolated Highest Alemannic Saleytitsch dialect which disappeared around 1963/64.

Conjugations with the word &quot;siin&quot; (be) were:
==Semitic languages==

The preterite was a common Semitic form, well attested in the Akkadian language, where the preterite almost always referred to the past and was often interchangeable with the perfect. In the course of time the preterite fell into disuse in all West Semitic languages, leaving traces such as the &quot;imperfect with waw-consecutive&quot; in Hebrew and &quot;imperfect with lam&quot; in Arabic.

<text>William Aldis Wright (1 August 183119 May 1914) was an English writer and classical scholar. He was best known for founding the &quot;The Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; alongside writer William George Clark. Additionally, he was friends with poet Edward FitzGerald and published many of his works posthumously.

==Life==
Wright was son of George Wright, a Baptist minister in Beccles, Suffolk. He was educated at Beccles Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1858. As a nonconformist, Wright was ineligible for election to a Trinity fellowship until 1878, but became Librarian and Senior Bursar of Trinity before that date. He opposed the allegations by Simonides that the &quot;Codex Sinaiticus&quot; discovered by Constantin von Tischendorf was produced around 1840. Duly elected Fellow in 1878, he became vice-master of the college in 1888. He was one of the editors of the &quot;Journal of Philology&quot; from its foundation in 1868, and was secretary to the Old Testament revision company from 1870 to 1885. He edited the plays of Shakespeare published in the &quot;Clarendon Press&quot; series (1868–97), also with W. G. Clark the &quot;Cambridge&quot; Shakespeare (1863–1866; 2nd ed. 1891–1893) and the &quot;Globe&quot; edition (1864). He added the Hebrew Index to &#x27;The Survey of Western Palestine&#x27; in 1888. He published a facsimile of the Milton manuscript in the Trinity College library (1899), and edited Milton&#x27;s poems with critical notes (1903).

He was the intimate friend and literary executor of Edward FitzGerald, whose &quot;Letters and Literary Remains&quot; he edited in 1889. This was followed by the &quot;Letters of Edward FitzGerald to Fanny Kemble&quot; (1895), his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1900), &quot;More Letters of Edward FitzGerald&quot; (1901), and &quot;The Works of Edward FitzGerald&quot; (7 vols., 1903). He edited the metrical chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (1887), &quot;Generydes&quot; (1878) for the Early English Text Society, &quot;Catalogue of the Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum&quot; (1–3 vol., 1870–1872), and other texts. His last publication was &quot;The Hexaplar Psalter&quot; (1911). In 1912 he resigned from the vice-mastership of Trinity College.

He donated a large collection of engravings by his uncle Thomas Higham to the British Museum in 1902.

He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

<doc id="215106" wikidata="Q209394" url="?curid=215106" title="Michael Wood (historian)">
<text>Michael David Wood, (born 23 July 1948) is an English historian and broadcaster. He has presented numerous well-known television documentary series from the late 1970s to the present day. Wood has also written a number of books on English history, including &quot;In Search of the Dark Ages&quot;, &quot;The Domesday Quest&quot;, &quot;The Story of England&quot;, and &quot;In Search of Shakespeare&quot;. He was appointed Professor of Public History at the University of Manchester in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Wood was born in Moss Side, Manchester, England. He attended Heald Place Primary School in Rusholme. When he was eight, his family moved to Paulden Avenue, Wythenshawe, where he could see historic Baguley Hall from his bedroom window. He went to Benchill Primary School. At Manchester Grammar School, he developed an interest in theatre, playing Grusha in the first British amateur production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; and later Hamlet in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. He took A-levels in English, French and History.

Wood studied History and English at Oriel College, Oxford, touring the United States for six weeks in his final year, and graduated with a second-class Bachelor of Arts degree. Later he undertook postgraduate research in Anglo-Saxon history at Oriel. Three years into his research for a DPhil, he left to become a journalist with ITV.

==Career==
In the 1970s, Wood worked for the BBC in Manchester. He was first a reporter and then an assistant producer on current affairs programmes before returning to his love of history with his 1979–81 series &quot;In Search of the Dark Ages&quot; for BBC2. He quickly became popular with female viewers for his blond good looks (he was humorously dubbed &quot;the thinking woman&#x27;s crumpet&quot; by British newspapers), his deep voice and his habit of wearing tight jeans and a sheepskin jacket. Wood&#x27;s work is also well known in the United States, where it is often broadcast on PBS and on various cable television networks. The series &quot;Legacy&quot; (1992) is one of his more frequently broadcast documentaries on US television.

Since 1990, Wood has been a director of independent television production company Maya Vision International. In 2006, he joined the British School of Archaeology in Iraq campaign, the aim of which was to train and encourage new Iraqi archaeologists, and he has lectured on the subject. In 2013, Wood joined the University of Manchester as Professor of Public History.

== Views ==
Wood has stated that while empires were often built on the power of swords, India alone created an empire of spirit. He introduces India&#x27;s history and culture in two sweeping sentences as: &quot;Over the next 3000 years Greeks and Kushans, Turks and Afghans, Mughals and British, Alexander, Tamburlaine and Babur, will all come and fall under India’s spell. And India’s greatest strength, one known only to the oldest civilizations, will be to adapt and change, to use the gifts of history and to accept its wounds, but somehow, magically, to be always India.&quot;

Wood favours returning artefacts looted during the age of imperialism. He has publicly supported moving the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum back to Attica.

Wood has termed the destruction in Gaza in the Israel-Hamas war more thorough than any ancient siege.

Writing in 2016 for the BBC History Magazine, Wood seemed to suggest that he favoured adding a statue of African hero/heroine in response to a movement asking to remove Oxford&#x27;s Cecil Rhodes statue at Oriel College.

In 2018, Wood called the UK Home Office&#x27;s destruction of landing cards of the Windrush generation an &quot;extraordinary act of vandalism.&quot;

In 2024, Wood said that with torrent of fake news and imagined histories, it is critical for historians of all persuasions to create good narratives of the past. But he says that no definitive story of the past is possible or desirable because the past is always changing.

Wood has described the use of term &#x27;golden age&#x27; as follows.&quot;All cultures of course have fixed on the idea of a great past, a golden age. But golden ages are imagined pasts. Real history is more complex, never static, always moving. And creating it in a realistic way for each generation is not just the preserve of politicians and thinkers, or the job of historians, but (and this is even more true in the age of the internet) of all of us. For identity is not a fixed thing, and it never was. It is always in the making, and never made.&quot;

==Personal life==
Wood&#x27;s girlfriend for ten years, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, was the journalist and broadcaster Pattie Coldwell. 

Wood lives in north London with his wife, television producer Rebecca Ysabel Dobbs, with whom he has two daughters.

Wood credits his family history, specifically his relatives&#x27; roles in World War II, for triggering interest in the past.
 &quot;My uncle Sid was torpedoed and sunk in the middle of the Mediterranean and swam through burning oil; Dad was in the hospital at Haslar on D-Day looking after the dead and the dying; Mum was caught in the blitz in the middle of Manchester and sheltered in a doorway all night.&quot;

==Honours and recognition==
Wood has been a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and Royal Society of the Arts. In 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by Sunderland University. This was followed by an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Leicester in 2011 and in 2015 he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the British Academy. Wood received honorary Doctor of Letters degrees from Lacaster University in 2007 and the University of Winchester in 2021. 

Wood is the president of the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding.

Wood was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 2008.

Wood was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to public history and broadcasting. He expressed that an opportunity had been missed to replace the word Empire with Excellence in OBE.

BAFTA-winning broadcaster David Olusoga has said that he was inspired as a teenager to become a historian by having watched Wood on television.

Historian and broadcaster Lucy Worsely has stated that Wood and his unconventional documentary format inspired her when she was a child.

Wood is a recipient of the Historical Association’s Medlicott Medal and has served as a Trustee of Historic Royal Palaces.

Wood has been a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a Trustee of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

The Wall Street Journal has described Story of India as &quot;the gold standard&quot; of documentary history making’.

The Independent has called &quot;The Story of England &quot;&quot;the most innovative history series ever made for TV.&quot;

The Chinese news agency, Xinhua, has said that &quot;The Story of China&quot; had &quot;transcended the barriers of ethnicity and belief and brought something inexplicably powerful and touching to the TV audience.&quot;

<doc id="215107" wikidata="Q604973" url="?curid=215107" title="Experience point">
<text>An experience point (often abbreviated as exp or XP) is a unit of measurement used in some tabletop role-playing games (RPGs) and role-playing video games to quantify a player character&#x27;s life experience and progression through the game. Experience points are generally awarded for the completion of objectives, overcoming obstacles and opponents, and successful role-playing.

In many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained. When a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the character &quot;levels up&quot;, achieving the next stage of character development. Such an event usually increases the character&#x27;s statistics, such as maximum health, magic and strength, and may permit the character to acquire new abilities or improve existing ones. Levelling up may also give the character access to more challenging areas or items.

In some role-playing games, particularly those derived from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, experience points are used to improve characters in discrete experience levels; in other games, such as &quot;GURPS&quot; and the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or attributes chosen by the player.

In most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience rewarded for overcoming it also increases. As players gain more experience points, the amount of experience needed to gain abilities typically increases. Alternatively, some games keep the number of experience points per level constant but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as the character&#x27;s level increases. Thus, as the player character strengthens from gaining experience, they are encouraged to accept new tasks that are commensurate with their improved abilities in order to advance.

==History==
The term &quot;experience point&quot; was introduced by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in the creation of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Arneson introduced a level-up system while playing a modification of &quot;Chainmail&quot;, for which Gygax was a co-author. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; needed an abbreviation for &quot;experience point&quot;, but EP was already in use for &quot;electrum pieces&quot;, part of the currency system. One of TSR&#x27;s first hires, Lawrence Schick, suggested the abbreviation to XP, to help Gygax complete the game manuals before release.

==Types==
Some games use hybrid advancement systems that combine elements from more than one of the following types.

===Level-based progression===

In many role-playing games, such as games derived from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;), an accumulation of a sufficient number of experience points (XP) increases a character&#x27;s &quot;level&quot;, a number that represents a character&#x27;s overall skill and experience. To &quot;level&quot; or &quot;level up&quot; means to gain enough XP to reach the next level. By gaining a level, a character&#x27;s abilities or stats increase, making the character stronger and able to accomplish more difficult tasks, such as safely battling stronger enemies, gaining access to more powerful spells or combat techniques, or resolving more difficult social challenges.

Typically, levels are associated with a character class, and many systems allow combinations of classes, allowing a player to customize how their character develops.

Some systems that use a level-based experience system also incorporate the ability to purchase specific traits with a set amount of experience. For example, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd Edition bases the creation of magical items around a system of experience expenditure (known as &quot;burning xp&quot;). The d20 System introduced the concept of prestige classes, sets of mechanics, character developments, and requirements that can be leveled up.

Some games have a level cap, or a limit of levels available. For example, in the online game &quot;RuneScape&quot;, no player can exceed level 120, which requires 104,273,167 experience points to gain, nor can any single skill gain more than 200 million experience points. Some games have a dynamic level cap, where the level cap changes over time depending upon the level of the average player.

===Activity-based progression===
In some systems, such as the classic tabletop role-playing games &quot;Traveller&quot;, &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot;, and the role-playing video games &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;, the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, and &quot;Grandia&quot; series, character progression is based on increasing individual statistics rather than general experience points. Skills and attributes grow through exercised use.

===Free-form advancement===

Free-form advancement is used by many role-playing systems including &quot;GURPS&quot;, &quot;Hero System&quot; or the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series. It allows the player to select which skills to advance by allocating &quot;points&quot;. Each character attribute is assigned a price to improve, so for example it might cost a character 2 points to raise an archery skill one notch, 10 points to raise overall dexterity by one, or it might cost 20 points to learn a new magic spell.

Players are typically free to spend points however they choose. Some games simplify free-form advancement by offering &quot;packages&quot; or &quot;templates&quot; of pre-selected ability sets.

===Cash-in advancement===
A cash-in experience advancement system uses experience points to &quot;purchase&quot; character advancements such as class levels, skill points, new skills, feats, and base attribute points. Each advancement has a set cost in experience points with set limits on the maximum bonuses that can be purchased at a given time, usually once per game session. Once experience points are used, they are erased or marked as spent from the character record and cannot be used again. &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; and &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot; are examples of games that use a cash-in advancement system.

==Video games==
Since many early role-playing video games are derived from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, most use a level-based experience system.

In many games, characters must obtain a minimum level to perform certain actions, such as wielding a particular weapon, entering a restricted area, or earning the respect of a non-player character. Some games use a system of &quot;character levels&quot;, where higher-level characters hold an absolute advantage over those of lower level. In these games, statistical character management is usually kept to a minimum. Other games use a system of &quot;skill levels&quot; to measure advantages in terms of specific aptitudes, such as weapon handling, spell-casting proficiency, and stealthiness. These games allow the players to customize their characters to a greater extent.

Some games, particularly MUDs and MMORPGs, place a limit on the experience a character gains from a single encounter or challenge, to reduce the effectiveness of power-leveling.

===Perks===

&quot;Perks&quot; are special bonuses that video game players can add to their characters to gain special abilities. The term refers to the general usage of &quot;&quot; as an abbreviation of &quot;&quot;. Perks are permanent rather than temporary and are progressively unlocked through experience points. The first video game to use the term &quot;perks&quot; to refer to such a mechanic was the 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Fallout&quot;.

Besides RPGs, perks have been used in various other video games in recent times, including first-person shooters such as &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; (2007), &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; (2009), and &quot;Killing Floor&quot; (2009), as well as action games such as &quot;Metal Gear Online&quot; (2008).

===Remorting===
&quot;Remorting&quot; (also known as &quot;rebirth&quot;, &quot;ascending/ascension&quot;, &quot;reincarnating&quot;, or &quot;new game plus&quot;) is a game mechanic in some role-playing games. Once a character reaches a specified level limit, the player can elect to start over with a new version of the character. The remorting character generally loses all levels, but gains an advantage that was previously unavailable, such as access to different races, avatars, classes, skills, or otherwise inaccessible play areas within the game. A symbol often identifies a remorted character.

The term &quot;remort&quot; comes from MUDs. In some MUDs, players may become immortal characters—administrative staff—simply by advancing to the maximum level. These users are generally expected to distance themselves from gameplay, and interaction with players may be severely limited. When an immortal chooses to vacate this position to resume playing the game—usually from level one just as with any new character—he or she is said to have remorted, &quot;becoming mortal again&quot;.

===Grinding===

Grinding refers to the process of repeating one specific activity over and over. This is done, for example, by repeatedly participating in challenges, quests, tasks and events which reward experience points for performing repetitive, often menial challenges. This definition can also be used in multi-player games, but it is typically displaced by a much more charged meaning. A term intended to describe this style of play without pejorative connotation is optimization, also known as &quot;XP farming&quot;.

=== Power-leveling===
Power-leveling is using the help of another, stronger player to level a character more quickly than is possible alone.

===Sharing===
Games that allow several characters to participate in a single event (such as battle or quest completion), implement various methods of determining how and when experience gets shared between participants. These methods include: only awarding experience to the character whose hit killed the enemy (as in &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series); sharing experience among characters (as in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;); and giving experience based on each character&#x27;s actions (as in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;). In some online games (for example &quot;Dungeon Defenders&quot;), it is possible to join a group and gain experience while providing little or no contribution to the group. This type of behavior is referred to as leeching. In games that allow players to gain rewards by kill stealing, this is also considered a form of leeching.

===Botting===

Some players of online games use automated programs known as bots to grind or leech for them in order to progress with minimal effort. This practice often violates the terms of service. Bots are also commonly used in commercial operations in order to powerlevel a character, either to increase the sale value of the account, or to allow the character to be used for commercial gold farming.

It can perform a number of tricks, including travelling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum; and appearing to levitate for a period of time after it has been dropped. These interesting characteristics have contributed to its success in its home country of the United States, and it has inspired many popular toys with Slinky-like components, in a wide range of countries. 

==History==

===Creation===

In 1943, Richard T. James, a naval mechanical engineer, observed a spring &quot;stepping&quot; downward after being knocked off a shelf, then coming to rest in a vertical position. James&#x27;s wife Betty later recalled, &quot;He came home and said, &#x27;I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension, I could make it walk.&#x27;&quot; James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would &quot;walk&quot;. Betty was skeptical, but changed her mind when the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it.

Richard and Betty formed James Industries and began manufacturing slinkys in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, selling them for $1 each. They were tall, and included 98 coils of high-grade blue-black Swedish steel. They initially had difficulty selling Slinky to toy stores, but in 1945, they were granted permission to set up an inclined plane in the toy section of Gimbels Department Store in Philadelphia to demonstrate it on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. It was an instant hit; the first 400 units were sold in 90 minutes. In 1946, Slinky was introduced at the American Toy Fair.

The Slinky was originally priced at $1, but many paid much more due to price increases of spring steel in Pennsylvania. It has, however, remained modestly priced throughout its history as a result of Betty James&#x27; concern about the toy&#x27;s affordability for less affluent customers. In addition to its use as a toy, it has been used as a classroom teaching tool; as a portable and extendable radio antenna in wartime (particularly the Vietnam War). It was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York in 2000. In 2003, it was named to the Toy Industry Association&#x27;s Century of Toys List. In its first 60 years, about 300 million Slinkys were sold.

===Subsequent developments===
In 1960, after his wife filed for divorce, Richard James left the company and he became an evangelical missionary in Bolivia with Wycliffe Bible Translators. Betty James moved the company to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania in 1964 and the company grew under her direction. She attributed the toy&#x27;s success to its &quot;simplicity&quot;. The company was sold to Poof Products, Inc. in 1998. Slinky continued production in Hollidaysburg.

Betty James died of congestive heart failure in November 2008, at age 90, after serving as James Industries&#x27; president from 1960 to 1998.

In July 2012, Poof-Slinky, Inc. was acquired by the private equity firm Propel Equity Partners. In 2014, Propel Equity Partners consolidated Poof-Slinky and several other toy brands into Alex Brands.

In July 2020, the Slinky brand was sold to Just Play.

==Physical properties==
The rules that govern the mechanics of a Slinky are Hooke&#x27;s law and the effects of gravitation.

===Period of oscillation===
The oscillation of a vertically suspended Slinky has the periodic duration

formula_1

where formula_2 is the length of the Slinky in the gravitational field of the Earth and formula_3 the acceleration due to gravity formula_4. Please note, that the expression for formula_5 is independent of the spring constant formula_6 and the mass formula_7 of the Slinky. For a spring pendulum one would expect such a dependence. This is because the dependence on formula_6 and formula_7 is hidden in the length formula_10:

formula_11

this allows one to write:

formula_12
This expression differs from the ordinary spring pendulum

formula_13

because for the spring pendulum one assumes a massless spring with a mass formula_7 attached at the bottom.

===Phenomena===

When set in motion on a stepped platform such as a stairway, the Slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave. The whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion as if it were &quot;walking&quot; down one step at a time.

When the top end of the Slinky is dropped, the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall; the top of an extended Slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position, compressing the spring. This creates a suspension time of ~0.3 s for an original Slinky, but has potential to create a much larger suspension time.
A suspended Slinky&#x27;s center of mass is accelerating downward at 1g (about ); when releasedthe lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extensionat the bottom of the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke&#x27;s law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closermeaning the base will have been displaced sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.

==Commercial history==

===Jingle===
The jingle for the Slinky television commercial was created in Columbia, South Carolina in 1962 with Johnny McCullough and Homer Fesperman writing the music and Charles Weagly penning the lyrics. It became the longest-running jingle in advertising history.

The jingle has itself been parodied and referenced in popular culture. It is seen in the &quot;Log&quot; commercial on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; and sung by actor Jim Carrey in &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;. It is also referenced in the movie &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, where it is sung in full by Emile Hirsch, and is sung by Eddie Murphy as part of the final routine in the stand-up comedy film &quot;Eddie Murphy Raw&quot;. It was also parodied in an ad for the Isuzu Amigo used as a promo for the vehicle&#x27;s return in late March 1998, nearly two months before the ad was pulled due to criticism from the company that made the Slinky.

===Slinky Dog===

Early in the history of James Industries, Helen Herrick Malsed of Washington state sent the company a letter and drawings for developing Slinky pull-toys. The company liked her ideas, and Slinky Dog and Slinky Train were added to the company&#x27;s product line. Slinky Dog, a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a metal Slinky, debuted in 1952. Malsed received royalties of $60,000 to $70,000 annually for 17 years on her patent for the Slinky pull-toy idea, but never visited the plant.

In 1995, the Slinky Dog (voiced by Jim Varney and Blake Clark) was redesigned for all of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies. James Industries had discontinued their Slinky Dog a few years previously. Betty James approved of the new Slinky Dog, telling the press, &quot;The earlier Slinky Dog wasn&#x27;t nearly as cute as this one.&quot;

===Plastic Slinky===

Plastic Slinkys are also available. They can be made in different colors. Many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order. They were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal Slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets. The plastic spring toy, known as the Plastic Slinky, was invented by Donald James Reum of Avon Plastics in Albany, Minnesota. Reum came up with the idea as he was experimenting with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants. However, as it came off the assembly line, according to his children, it looked more like a &quot;Slinky&quot;. He worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to Betty James with his prototype. Reum manufactured the Plastic Slinky for Betty James for several years. Eventually Betty James decided to manufacture the product exclusively through James manufacturing, effectively ending the production of the toy by the small Minnesota company. Reum&#x27;s patent number, 4120929 was filed on December 28, 1976, and issued by the U.S. Patent Office on October 17, 1978.

==Awards and honors==
In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a Slinky postage stamp. The Slinky was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2000 in their Celebrate the Century stamp series. A bill to nominate the Slinky as the state toy of Pennsylvania was introduced by Richard Geist in 2001 but not enacted. The same year, Betty James was inducted into the Toy Industry Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2003, Slinky was named to the Toy Industry Association&#x27;s &quot;Century of Toys List&quot; of the 20th century&#x27;s 100 most memorable and creative toys.

==Other uses==

Slinkys and similar springs can be used to create a &#x27;laser gun&#x27; like sound effect. This is done by holding up a Slinky in the air and striking one end, causing a metallic sound that sharply lowers in pitch. The effect can be amplified by attaching a plastic cup to one end of the Slinky.

The &quot;Helixophone&quot; is the name composer and artist Sonia Paço-Rocchia gave to a musical instrument made with a Slinky and a resonator. &quot;Hélix&quot; is a sound installation with up to 20 Helixophones, automated and playing an interactive sound composition. 

Metal Slinkys can be used as an antenna; it resonates between 7 and 8 MHz. During the Vietnam War, it was used as a portable antenna for local HF communication. This setup had many advantages over a long wire shot from M79 grenade launcher: small dimensions, fast and quiet installation, reusability, good takeoff angle for local communication, and adequate performance. It was also used to extend the ranges of handheld radios.

In 1985, in conjunction with the Johnson Space Center and the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Space Shuttle Discovery astronauts created a video demonstrating how familiar toys behaved in space. One astronaut described the toy as &quot;sort of droop[ing]&quot;. The video was prepared to stimulate interest in school children about the basic principles of physics and the phenomenon of weightlessness.

Several online videos have shown that a Slinky can be mounted on the pole of a bird feeder to deter squirrels from climbing up the pole.

<doc id="215109" wikidata="Q8009776" url="?curid=215109" title="William George Clark">
<text>William George Clark (18 March 18216 November 1878) was an English writer and classical scholar. He was best known for founding the &quot;Journal of Philology&quot; and &quot;The Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; alongside writer William Aldis Wright.

==Life==
He was born at Barford Hall, Darlington. He was educated at Sedbergh School, Shrewsbury School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in classics and won a Browne medal and was subsequently elected Fellow. In 1857 he was appointed Public Orator. He travelled much during the long vacations, visiting Spain, Greece, Italy and Poland.

In 1853 Clark had taken orders, but left the Church after the passing of the Clerical Disabilities Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 91), of which he was one of the promoters. He also resigned the public oratorship in the same year, and in consequence of illness left Cambridge in 1873. He died at York on 6 November 1878.

He bequeathed a sum of money to his old college for the foundation of a lectureship in English literature.

==Works==
Clark established the &quot;Cambridge Journal of Philology&quot;, and cooperated with Benjamin Hall Kennedy and James Riddell in the production of the &quot;Sabrinae Corolla&quot;. He published little as a classical scholar. A contemplated edition of the works of Aristophanes was never published. He visited Italy in 1868 to examine the Ravenna manuscript of Aristophanes and other manuscripts, and on his return began the notes to the &quot;Acharnians&quot;, but they were left incomplete.

The work by which he is best known is the &quot;Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; (1863–6), containing a collation of early editions and selected emendations, edited by him at first with John Glover and later with William Aldis Wright. &quot;Gazpacho&quot; (1853) gives an account of his tour in Spain; his &quot;Peloponnesus&quot; (1858) was a contribution to the knowledge of Greece. His visits to Italy at the time of Garibaldi&#x27;s insurrection, and to Poland during the insurrection of 1863, are described in &quot;Vacation Tourists&quot;, ed. Francis Galton, i and iii.

Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro in &quot;Journal of Philology&quot; (viii. 1879) described Clark as &quot;the most accomplished and versatile man he ever met&quot;.

<doc id="215113" wikidata="Q691064" url="?curid=215113" title="Tristram Hunt">
<text>Tristram Julian William Hunt, (born 31 May 1974) is a British historian, broadcast journalist and former politician who has been Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum since 2017. He served as the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke-on-Trent Central from 2010 to 2017, and Shadow Secretary of State for Education from 2013 to 2015.

He has written several books, presented history programmes on television, and was a regular writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hunt was born in Cambridge, the son of Julian Hunt, a meteorologist and leader of the Labour Party group on Cambridge City Council in 1972–73, who in 2000 was awarded a life peerage as Baron Hunt of Chesterton, and the grandson of Roland Hunt, a British diplomat. The Hunt family were goldsmiths and silversmiths in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; John Samuel Hunt (1785–1865) being in business with his uncle-by-marriage, Paul Storr; also descended from John Samuel Hunt was John Hunt, Baron Hunt of Fawley.

Hunt is the great-grandson of Maxwell Garnett, barrister and educationist, and great-great-grandson of William Garnett, an academic and professor in physics. As such he is a cousin of Virginia Bottomley, Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone, and of Peter Jay, former son-in-law of the late Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. Through Bottomley, he is related by marriage to Sir Peter Bottomley and former Labour MP and economist Kitty Ussher.

Tristram Hunt was educated at University College School, an all-boys&#x27; private school in Hampstead, north London. There, he achieved two As (History and Latin) and a B (English Literature) at A-Level. He took a First in History at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1995.

He later attended the University of Chicago, and was for a time an Associate Fellow of the Centre for History and Economics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He undertook postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge and completed his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 2000. His thesis was titled &quot;Civic Thought in Britain, c.1820–c.1860&quot;. While at Cambridge he was a member of the amateur theatrical club the Footlights, where he was a contemporary of David Mitchell and Robert Webb.

==History career==
Hunt was a Fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research and sits on the board of the New Local Government Network (2004). He has made many appearances on television, presenting programmes on the English Civil War (2002), the theories of Sir Isaac Newton (&quot;Great Britons&quot;, 2002), and the rise of the middle class, and makes regular appearances on BBC Radio 4, having presented broadcasts on such topics as the history of the signature. His first book was &quot;The English Civil War: At First Hand&quot; (2002).

His specialism is urban history, specifically during the Victorian era, and it is this subject which provided him with his second book, &quot;Building Jerusalem&quot; (2004). This book, covering such notable Victorian minds as John Ruskin, Joseph Chamberlain and Thomas Carlyle, received many favourable reviews but some criticism, notably a scathing review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; by J. Mordaunt Crook.

Hunt wrote &quot;Making our Mark&quot;, a publication celebrating of the eightieth anniversary of CPRE, The Countryside Charity, in 2006. He then completed a BBC series entitled &quot;The Protestant Revolution&quot;, examining the influence of Protestantism on British and international attitudes to work and leisure for broadcast on BBC Four. In 2007 Hunt was a judge for the Samuel Johnson Prize, the winner being &quot;Imperial Life in the Emerald City&quot; by Rajiv Chandrasekaran.

Hunt wrote a biography of Friedrich Engels, &quot;The Frock-Coated Communist: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels&quot;, which was published in May 2009 by Penguin Books. For the book, Hunt researched at German and Russian libraries and begins with an account of his own visit to the city of Engels in Russia. The biography received a number of favourable reviews, including one from Roy Hattersley, the former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, in &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Hunt was a lecturer in modern British History at Queen Mary University of London. On 18 May 2013, Dr Hunt delivered his lecture &#x27;Aristocracy and Industry: the Sutherlands in Staffordshire&#x27; at The Marc Fitch Lectures.

Hunt&#x27;s book &quot;Ten Cities That Made an Empire&quot; was published by Allen Lane in 2014. It was dubbed a &quot;lively study of imperial outposts&quot; by the historian Robert Service, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Political career==
A member of the Labour Party, Hunt supported the party as an activist for several years before working on the party&#x27;s staff. Hunt worked for the Labour Party at Millbank Tower during the 1997 general election; he also worked at the party headquarters during the following 2001 general election. During the 2005 general election he campaigned for Oona King in Bethnal Green and Bow.

Hunt twice submitted his name unsuccessfully for selection as a Labour parliamentary candidate: Liverpool West Derby, where Stephen Twigg was selected (2007), and Leyton and Wanstead, where John Cryer was selected (2009).

Hunt was selected to contest the constituency of Stoke-on-Trent Central on 1 April 2010, succeeding Labour&#x27;s outgoing MP, Mark Fisher. Because the candidacy was filled just before the election, the shortlist was drawn up by Labour&#x27;s ruling National Executive Committee selection panel, with none on the shortlist local to Stoke-on-Trent. This led to the secretary of the Constituency Labour Party, Gary Elsby, standing against Hunt as an independent candidate in protest. Despite the controversy of being &quot;parachuted in&quot; to the district, Hunt was elected with 38.8% of the vote. Although the election was the constituency&#x27;s closest-fought contest in decades, Hunt still had a majority of 5,566 over his nearest rival.

Hunt was appointed a Shadow Education Minister in April 2013, replacing Karen Buck who advanced as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ed Miliband. On 7 October 2013, Hunt was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, replacing Stephen Twigg as Shadow Secretary of State for Education.

In February 2014, Hunt crossed an authorised University and College Union picket line at Queen Mary University of London to teach his students about &quot;Marx, Engels and the Making of Marxism&quot;, defending himself on the grounds that although he was not a member of the union, he supported the right to strike and picket by those who had been ballotted. He was strongly criticised by West Bromwich East MP Tom Watson, who described Hunt&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;preposterous&quot;.

Hunt was re-elected in May 2015 with a majority of 5,179. Hunt ran a hapless bid for the leadership of the Labour party but dropped out after less than a week after he was nowhere near gathering the 35 nominations from MPs he needed to stand. On 12 September 2015, it became known he was leaving the shadow cabinet following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour leader because of their &quot;substantial political differences&quot;, as Hunt told the Press Association.

On 13 January 2017, he announced that he would be resigning as an MP in order to take up the post of Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He formally resigned, taking the post of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, on 23 January 2017. His successor as MP, Gareth Snell, retained the seat for Labour in the subsequent by-election on 23 February 2017.

===Political views===
Hunt was formerly a trustee of the Heritage Lottery Fund and has a column with the British Sunday paper &quot;The Observer&quot;. He wrote an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; comparing Cromwell&#x27;s Republic to the Islamic fundamentalism dominant in Afghanistan at that time (2001).

Speaking of his constituency, Hunt said that &quot;The key to helping manufacturing is investing in education and schools and also selling Stoke nationally and internationally as a place to invest.&quot; He also criticised the local council&#x27;s decision &quot;to try to obliterate the past out and sort of &#x27;cleanse&#x27;, removing the old bottle ovens and other relics&quot;. He instead believed that the city&#x27;s reputation as a quality pottery maker should be exploited. He said he could better serve his constituency were he to become a Government Minister.

Hunt was accused in February 2015 of implying in a BBC &quot;Question Time&quot; discussion on teachers without qualifications that nuns do not make good teachers. His comments were criticised by Conservative MPs and by the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Hunt stated that he did not mean to cause offence to nuns.

In 2014, he proposed that private schools should be required to form &quot;partnerships&quot; with local state schools if they wanted to keep their charitable status.

Hunt has been a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

== Victoria and Albert Museum directorship ==
In February 2017, Hunt became the Director of the V&amp;A. In this role he has advocated for the necessity for creative subjects to be taught in state schools, fearing that designer jobs are considered &#x27;only for the posh.&#x27;

In 2020, the V&amp;A will stage the largest exhibition of Iranian art outside of Iran, called &#x27;Epic Iran&#x27;. But crisis in the Middle East may make some of the items unavailable. Hunt, when asked to comment, said that the exhibition was still likely to go ahead, but, in an article for &quot;The Art Newspaper&quot;, admitted that &quot;some of the loans might now be less forthcoming and sponsorship more of a challenge.&quot;

In June 2023, Hunt ordered the removal of two books on gender and sexual orientation, as well as a poster by the charity Stonewall that read &quot;Some people are trans, get over it!&quot;, from the Young V&amp;A, ahead of the museum&#x27;s reopening. The V&amp;A Staff LGBTQ Working Group and trade unions PCS and Prospect opposed the removals. Union representatives appealed the decision in a meeting with Hunt, who rejected their request to have the items returned to the museum.

Hunt has been vocal in his support of the Sackler family, the American billionaire family linked to the opioid crisis. In 2019 he defended the family&#x27;s contributions to the museum, refused to remove their name from the museum&#x27;s courtyard and said &quot;we&#x27;re proud to have been supported by the Sacklers.&quot; In 2022 the museum reversed course and removed the name.

==Personal life==
Hunt is married to Juliet Thornback with whom he has one son and two daughters; they live in London. He is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

<text>Sampson Salter Blowers (March 10, 1742 – October 25, 1842) was a noted North American lawyer, Loyalist and jurist from Nova Scotia who, along with Chief Justice Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange, waged &quot;judicial war&quot; in his efforts to free Black Nova Scotian slaves from their owners, leading to the decline of slavery in Nova Scotia.

==Career==
After graduating with a Master of Arts from Harvard College in 1765, he studied law at Thomas Hutchinson&#x27;s office. He became a barrister at the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1770. His home on Southack&#x27;s Court (present-day Phillips Street) at Beacon Hill, Boston bordered on the properties of John Hancock, John Winthrop and John Phillips (mayor). A very successful trial lawyer, he worked with Josiah Quincy and John Adams in defending the soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre, a March 1770 confrontation in which British soldiers fired into a crowd of a few hundred Bostonians who had been verbally harassing and throwing projectiles at them.

Considered a Loyalist, he was forced to relocate to England in 1774. He resettled in America in 1777, in Newport, Rhode Island (then still under British control) as a judge in the vice admiralty court, later moving to New York, and then in 1783 moved permanently to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

In Halifax he built a busy law practice, and in 1784 was named attorney general of Nova Scotia. The following year, he was appointed attorney general for New Brunswick but refused the post, not wanting to relocate his family. Later that year, he was named attorney general for Nova Scotia. In 1785, he was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for Halifax County and was chosen to be speaker for the assembly. In 1788, he was named to the Nova Scotia Council.

Because Blowers put the onus on slave owners to prove that they had a legal right to purchase slaves, slavery died out in Nova Scotia early in the 1800s, unlike in New Brunswick, where Chief Justice George Duncan Ludlow had ruled that slavery was legal.

==Personal life==
The young Sampson Salter Blowers became an orphan after his father died soon after his return from the Siege of Louisbourg. Blowers was raised by his grandfather, Sampson Salter. In 1774, he married Sarah Kent, daughter of Massachusetts Attorney General Benjamin Kent. In Halifax Blowers lived at the corner of Barrington Street and the street now named after him. Blowers died in Halifax in 1842, aged 100, soon after he broke his hip in a fall. Most of his estate went to his adopted daughter, Sarah Ann Anderson, who had married William Blowers Bliss. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Church (Halifax) and his wife is buried in Camphill Cememtery. Although he lost a substantial amount of property in the American War of Independence, he regained his wealth in Nova Scotia, leaving a large estate to his adopted daughter.

<text>Damned Damned Damned is the debut studio album by English punk rock band the Damned. It was released on 18 February 1977 by Stiff Records. Produced by Nick Lowe, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; was the first full-length album released by a UK punk group. The album peaked at No. 34 on the UK Charts.

== Background and production ==
After the success of &quot;New Rose&quot; and a tour with the Sex Pistols, the Heartbreakers and the Clash, the band went into Pathway Studios to record the album &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; with producer Nick Lowe, who had previously recorded &quot;New Rose&quot; with them. Following 10 days of recording, the mix was completed on 15 January 1977, the day the master tapes were compiled.

== Album cover ==
The album cover features the four members of the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: &quot;That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff Records had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into it and enjoy the whole experience&quot;. After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: &quot;... I had more pie on my face than any of the other buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said &#x27;put that on there&#x27; so I would have something to show my relatives, because I didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be invited to make another album&quot;. Stiff, however, used a different photo than the one Sensible gave to the label.

Stiff deliberately printed a limited number of initial copies of the LP with a photo of Eddie and the Hot Rods on the back of the album cover, rather than the Damned playing at The Roxy. An &quot;erratum&quot; sticker was also put on the back cover, and on the front of the LP - on top of the original shrink wrap - was a red &quot;food-fight&quot; sticker that said &quot;Damned Damned&quot;, thus completing the LP title when read underneath the band&#x27;s name. Stiff was known for such unusual promotional activity. As of 2020, a copy of this rare print which still had both stickers and the shrink wrap intact (slit-open or sealed) fetched £650–1500, depending on condition.

The album design was credited to Big Jobs Inc, a pseudonym of Barney Bubbles.

== Release and reception==
&quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; was issued by Stiff Records on 18 February 1977, which was also James&#x27; 22nd birthday.In a contemporary review for &quot;NME&quot;, Chris Welch praised the Damned&#x27;s musical ability, opining that the band have &quot;all the residual skills needed for the actual performance of exhausting modern music&quot;. Welch remarked that James was the most effective powerhouse guitarist since Pete Townshend and concluded that the album as a whole was &quot;a highly professional production and is much more convincing than some other new wave bands I&#x27;ve heard on record.&quot;

In a 1980 Trouser Press review of &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot;, Ira Robbins described &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; as &quot;instant obsolescence despite near-perfection&quot;.

BBC Music&#x27;s retrospective review praised the album&#x27;s energy, pop satire and general humour, with reviewer Chris Jones commenting, &quot;Each track featured the hammering toms of Rat Scabies and Captain Sensible&#x27;s bass-as-guitar propelling Brian James&#x27; exhilarating machine gun axe into your living room&quot;.

The American press has also favored the album. Ned Raggett of AllMusic called it &quot;a stone classic of rock &amp; roll fire&quot; and declared that &quot;&quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; is and remains rock at its messy, wonderful best.&quot; In a review of the Damned&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Grave Disorder&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Joe Tangari cited &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; as the only two Damned albums that he found &quot;very good&quot;.

== Track listing ==

;Note

Disc 3 was recorded at the Damned&#x27;s live debut at the 100 Club on 6 July 1976 supporting the Sex Pistols. Recorded on a Sony cassette recorder, hidden in a sports bag, onto a Scotch 120 tape.

<doc id="215131" wikidata="Q7347441" url="?curid=215131" title="Robert Mayer (philanthropist)">
<text>Sir Robert Mayer (5 June 1879 – 9 January 1985) was a German-born British philanthropist, businessman, and a major supporter of music and young musicians.

==Early life ==
Mayer was born in Mannheim, Germany; his father was a brewer. From the age of 5 Mayer attended the Mannheim conservatoire, where, at the age of 11, he prepared a piano ballade by Brahms but was not chosen to perform it before the composer. However he sat next to Brahms during the concert. He also studied under Felix Weingartner.

His father however insisted that Mayer go into business. Initially he worked in the lace trade, and then, moving to London in 1896, became a banker, whilst continuing his piano studies with Fanny Davies and others. Mayer became a citizen of the United Kingdom in 1902, and joined the British army in the First World War.

==Personal life ==
His first wife, the soprano Dorothy Moulton Piper (d. 1974), an avant garde singer whom he married in 1919, encouraged him to continue his interest in music. Early in their married life, whilst living in the United States, Mayer came across the children&#x27;s concerts organised by Walter Damrosch, and he was inspired by these to found the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children in 1923 (and later set up &quot; &#x27;Youth and Music&#x27; &quot;, founded 1954, and affiliated to Jeunesses Musicales). The first series of concerts were conducted by Adrian Boult and Malcolm Sargent.

Mayer had three children, two of whom would go on to survive him: Adrian and Pauline. In 1980, aged 101, he remarried to Lady Jacqueline Mayer Noble. 

==Founding==

In 1932, Mayer was one of the founders of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and he also helped found the London Schools Symphony Orchestra in 1951. He was also involved, with Egon Wellesz, with the founding of the ISCM.

==Centenarian==

His 100th birthday in 1979 was a national celebration that included a gala concert at the Royal Festival Hall which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II. On the day of his 100th birthday he was a guest on the BBC&#x27;s radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Later in that year Mayer, joined by Joyce Grenfell and Robin Ray, appeared as a guest on the BBC TV quiz &quot;Face The Music&quot;.

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Bernard Keeffe played music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Benjamin Britten, Malcolm Arnold and Jean Sibelius, the most requested works as the result of a poll.

Although Chaim Weizmann referred to him as &quot;an assimilated Jew&quot;, Mayer replied &quot;I am a man, not a Jew or a non-Jew&quot;.

==Autobiography ==
Mayer published an autobiography titled &quot;My First 100 Years&quot; in 1979.

==National Order ==
He was created a Knight Bachelor by George VI in 1939, and was created a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) by Elizabeth II in 1973. He was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) by the Queen in 1979.

<doc id="215139" wikidata="Q2632944" url="?curid=215139" title="Second London Naval Treaty">
<text>The Second London Naval Treaty was an international treaty signed as a result of the Second London Naval Disarmament Conference held in London. The conference started on 9 December 1935 and the treaty was signed by the participating nations on 25 March 1936.

==Treaty==
The signatories were France, the United States, and most members of the British Commonwealth: Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (on behalf of itself and &quot;all parts of the British Empire which are not separate Members of the League of Nations&quot;). Two Commonwealth Dominions declined to sign: South Africa and the Irish Free State, the latter because it had no navy. Japan, a signatory of the First London Naval Treaty and already at war on the Asian mainland, withdrew from the conference on 15 January. Italy also declined to sign the treaty, largely as a result of the controversy over its invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia); Italy was under sanctions from the League of Nations.

The conference was intended to limit the growth in naval armaments until its expiration in 1942. The absence of Japan (a very significant naval power) prevented agreement on a ceiling on the numbers of warships. The treaty did limit the maximum size of the signatories&#x27; ships, and the maximum calibre of the guns which they could carry. First of all, capital ships were restricted to a standard displacement and 14-inch (356 mm) guns. However, a so-called &quot;escalator clause&quot; was included at the urging of American negotiators in case any of the countries that had signed the Washington Naval Treaty refused to adhere to this new limit. This provision allowed the signatory countries of the Second London Treaty—France, the United Kingdom and the United States—to raise the limit from 14-inch guns to 16-inch if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after 1 April 1937.

Also submarines could not be larger than 2,000 tons or have any gun armament of greater than 5.1 inches, light cruisers were restricted to 8,000 tons and 6.1-inch (155 mm) or smaller guns and aircraft carriers were restricted to 23,000 tons. Article 25 however gave the right to depart limitations if any other country authorised, constructed or acquired a capital ship, an aircraft carrier, or a submarine exceeding treaty limits, and if such a departure would be necessary for national security. For this reason, in 1938 the treaty parties agreed on a new displacement limit of 45,000 tons for battleships, the ill-fated battlecruiser already having fallen out of favor.

This London Naval Treaty effectively ended on 1 September 1939 with the beginning of World War II. Even during its brief period of supposed effectiveness, three classes of &quot;treaty&quot; battleships were built or laid down under its limitations, the &quot;King George V&quot;, , and classes. The designs of the &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot; classes were initiated before the escalator clause was invoked, being intended to be armed with, and protected against, 14-inch guns. The United Kingdom declined to invoke the clause, as redesigning the vessels and developing the proposed 15-inch guns would have delayed construction by 18 months, and since these new battleships were badly needed it was considered prudent to build vessels already finalized with 14-inch guns, even if that meant accepting a reduction in firepower compared to adversaries. The United States invoked the escalator clause after the keels were laid for the two members of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class, since the class was designed from the onset to be up-gunned from the original 14-inch main battery with minor modification, so they were completed with 16-inch guns since the United States could afford the delay. However, the completed vessel was an unbalanced battleship since its armor scheme was not proof against its up-gunned main armament, so no further ships of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; were ordered. The four battleships of the &quot;South Dakota&quot; class were designed with and protected against 16-inch guns, but maintained a 35,000 ton standard displacement, so this necessitated a shorter hull which made for a compact and cramped ship. No longer limited to the Second London Naval Treaty but still constrained by the need to pass through the Panama Canal, design of the began in 1938 and its orders were placed in 1939; with improved 16-inch guns and greater speed on a displacement of 45,000 tons.

Article 22 of the 1930 Treaty of London relating to submarine warfare declared international law (the so-called &quot;cruiser rules&quot;) applied to submarines as well as to surface vessels. Also, unarmed merchant vessels which did not demonstrate &quot;persistent refusal to stop...or active resistance to visit or search&quot; could not be sunk without the ships&#x27; crews and passengers being first delivered to &quot;a place of safety&quot; (for which lifeboats did not qualify, except under particular circumstances). The 1936 treaty confirmed Article 22 of the 1930 treaty remained in force, and &quot;all others Powers [were invited] to express their assent to the rules embodied in this Article&quot;. This became known as the London Submarine Protocol, and over thirty-five nations eventually did subscribe to it, including the U.S., Britain, Germany, and Japan. It was this Protocol which was used at the post war Nuremberg Trial of Karl Dönitz for ordering unrestricted submarine warfare. These regulations did not prohibit arming merchantmen, but according to Dönitz, arming them, or having them report contact with submarines (or raiders), made them &quot;de facto&quot; naval auxiliaries and removed the protection of the cruiser rules. This made restrictions on submarines effectively moot.

<text>U.S. imperialism or American imperialism is the expansion of political, economic, cultural, media, and military influence beyond the boundaries of the United States of America. Depending on the commentator, it may include imperialism through outright military conquest; military protection; gunboat diplomacy; unequal treaties; subsidization of preferred factions; regime change; economic or diplomatic support; or economic penetration through private companies, potentially followed by diplomatic or forceful intervention when those interests are threatened.

The policies perpetuating American imperialism and expansionism are usually considered to have begun with &quot;New Imperialism&quot; in the late 19th century, though some consider American territorial expansion and settler colonialism at the expense of Indigenous Americans to be similar enough in nature to be identified with the same term. While the United States has never officially identified itself and its territorial possessions as an empire, some commentators have referred to the country as such, including Max Boot, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and Niall Ferguson. Other commentators have accused the United States of practicing neocolonialism—sometimes defined as a modern form of hegemony—which leverages economic power rather than military force in an informal empire; the term &quot;neocolonialism&quot; has occasionally been used as a contemporary synonym for modern-day imperialism.

The question of whether the United States should intervene in the affairs of foreign countries has been a much-debated topic in domestic politics for the country&#x27;s entire history.
Opponents of interventionism have pointed to the country&#x27;s origin as a former colony that rebelled against an overseas king, as well as the American values of democracy, freedom, and independence.
Conversely, supporters of interventionism and of American presidents who have attacked foreign countries — most notably Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, William McKinley, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft — have justified their interventions in (or whole seizures of) various countries by citing the necessity of advancing American economic interests, such as trade and debt management; preventing European intervention (colonial or otherwise) in the Western Hemisphere, manifested in the anti-European Monroe Doctrine of 1823; and the benefits of keeping &quot;good order&quot; around the world.

== History ==

=== Overview ===

Despite periods of peaceful co-existence in the early 1600s, wars with Native Americans resulted in substantial territorial gains for American colonists who were expanding into native land. Wars with the Native Americans continued intermittently after independence, and an ethnic cleansing campaign known as Indian removal gained for European American settlers more valuable territory on the eastern side of the continent.

George Washington, a founding father and first president of the United States, began a policy of United States non-interventionism which lasted into the 1800s. The United States promulgated the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, in order to stop further European colonialism in the Latin America. Desire for territorial expansion to the Pacific Ocean was explicit in the idea of manifest destiny. The giant Louisiana Purchase was peaceful, but the annexation of of Mexican territory was the result of the Mexican–American War of 1846.

The Cold War reoriented American foreign policy towards opposing communism, and prevailing U.S. foreign policy embraced its role as a nuclear-armed global superpower. Through the Truman Doctrine and Reagan Doctrine the United States framed the mission as protecting free peoples against an undemocratic system, anti-Soviet foreign policy became coercive and occasionally covert. United States involvement in regime change included overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran, the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba, occupation of Grenada, and interference in various foreign elections. The long and bloody Vietnam War led to widespread criticism of an &quot;arrogance of power&quot; and violations of international law emerging from an &quot;imperial presidency,&quot; with Martin Luther King Jr., among others, accusing the US of a new form of colonialism.

In terms of territorial acquisition, the United States has integrated (with voting rights) all of its acquisitions on the North American continent, including the non-contiguous Alaska. Hawaii has also become a state with equal representation to the mainland, but other island jurisdictions acquired during wartime remain territories, namely Guam, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. (The federal government officially apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian government in 1993.) The remainder of acquired territories have become independent with varying degrees of cooperation, ranging from three freely associated states which participate in federal government programs in exchange for military basing rights, to Cuba which severed diplomatic relations during the Cold War. The United States was a public advocate for European decolonization after World War II (having started a ten-year independence transition for the Philippines in 1934 with the Tydings–McDuffie Act). Even so, the US desire for an informal system of global primacy in an &quot;American Century&quot; often brought them into conflict with national liberation movements. The United States has now granted citizenship to Native Americans and recognizes some degree of tribal sovereignty.

=== 1700s–1800s: Indigenous American Wars and manifest destiny ===

Yale historian Paul Kennedy has asserted, &quot;From the time the first settlers arrived in Virginia from England and started moving westward, this was an imperial nation, a conquering nation.&quot; Expanding on George Washington&#x27;s description of the early United States as an &quot;infant empire&quot;, Benjamin Franklin wrote: &quot;Hence the Prince that acquires new Territory, if he finds it vacant, or removes the Natives to give his own People Room; the Legislator that makes effectual Laws for promoting of Trade, increasing Employment, improving Land by more or better Tillage; providing more Food by Fisheries; securing Property, etc. and the Man that invents new Trades, Arts or Manufactures, or new Improvements in Husbandry, may be properly called Fathers of their Nation, as they are the Cause of the Generation of Multitudes, by the Encouragement they afford to Marriage.&quot; Thomas Jefferson asserted in 1786 that the United States &quot;must be viewed as the nest from which all America, North &amp; South is to be peopled. [...] The navigation of the Mississippi we must have. This is all we are as yet ready to receive.&quot;. From the left Noam Chomsky writes that &quot;the United States is the one country that exists, as far as I know, and ever has, that was founded as an empire explicitly&quot;.

A national drive for territorial acquisition across the continent was popularized in the 19th century as the ideology of manifest destiny. The policy of settlement of land was a foundational goal of the United States of America, with one of the driving factors of discontent with British rule originating from the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which barred settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. As part of the desire of Manifest Destiny to open up land for American settlement came campaigns in the Great Lakes region which saw the United States fight the Northwestern Confederacy resulting in the Northwest Indian War. Subsequent treaties such as the Treaty of Greenville and the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) resulted in a rise of Anti-American sentiment among the Native Americans in the Great Lakes region, which helped to create Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy which was defeated by the end of the War of 1812. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 culminated in the deportation of 60,000 Native Americans in an event known as the Trail of Tears, where up to 16,700 people died in an act of ethnic cleansing. The deportation of Natives West of the Mississippi, resulted in significant economic gains for settlers. For example, the Arkansas firm, Byrd and Belding earned up to $27,000 in two years through supplying food. The policy of Manifest Destiny would continue to be realized with the Mexican–American War of 1846, which resulted in the cession of of Mexican territory to the United States, stretching up to the Pacific coast. The Whig Party strongly opposed this war and expansionism generally.

Following the American victory over Mexico, colonization and settlement of California would begin which would soon lead to the California genocide. Estimates of total deaths in the genocide vary greatly from 2,000 to 100,000. The discovery of Gold in California resulted in an influx of settlers, who formed militias to kill and displace Indigenous peoples. The government of California supported expansion and settlement through the passage of the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians which legalized the enslavement of Native Americans and allowed settlers to capture and force them into labor. California further offered and paid bounties for the killing of Native Americans.

American expansion in the Great Plains resulted in conflict between many tribes West of the Mississippi and the United States. In 1851, the Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed, which gave the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes territory from the North Platte River in present-day Wyoming and Nebraska southward to the Arkansas River in present-day Colorado and Kansas. The land was initially not wanted by White settlers, but following the discovery of gold in the region, settlers began to pour into the territory. In 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise which saw the loss of 90% of their land. The refusal of various warriors to recognise the treaty resulted in white settlers starting to believe that war was coming. The subsequent Colorado War would result in the Sand Creek Massacre in which up to 600 Cheyenne were killed, most of whom were children and women. On October 14, 1865, the chiefs of what remained of the Southern Cheyennes and Arapahos agreed to live south of the Arkansas, sharing land that belonged to the Kiowas, and thereby relinquish all claims in the Colorado territory.

Following the victory of Red Cloud in Red Cloud&#x27;s War over the United States, the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) was signed. This treaty led to the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation. However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills resulted in a surge of White settlement in the region. The gold rush was very profitable for the White settlers and the American government, with just one of the Black Hill Mines yielding $500 Million in gold. Attempts to purchase the land failed, and the Great Sioux War began as a result. Despite initial success by Native Americans in the war&#x27;s first few battles, most notably the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the United States eventually won and ended the reservation, carving it up into smaller reservations. The reservation system did not just serve as a way to facilitate American settlement and expansion of land, but also enriched local merchants and businesses who held significant economic power over the Native tribes. Traders would often accept payment for goods via annuity money from land sales contributing to further poverty.

In the South-West, various settlements and communities had been established thanks to profits from the American Civil War. In order to maintain revenue and profit, settlers often waged war against native tribes. By 1871, the settlement of Tucson for example had a population of three thousand, including saloon-keepers, traders and contractors who had made fortunes during the Civil War and were hopeful of continuing their profits with an Indian war. Desire to fight resulted in the Camp Grant Massacre of 1871 where up to 144 Apache were killed, most being women and children. Up to 27 Apache children were captured and sold into slavery in Mexico. In the 1860s, the Navajo faced deportation in an attempted act of ethnic cleansing under the Long Walk of the Navajo. The &quot;Long Walk&quot; started at the beginning of spring 1864. Bands of Navajo led by the Army were relocated from their traditional lands in eastern Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory to Fort Sumner. Around 200 died during the march. During the march, New Mexican slavers, assisted by the Ute often attacked isolated bands, killing the men, taking the women and children captive, and capturing horses and livestock. As part of these raids, a large number of slaves were taken and sold throughout the region.

Starting in 1820, the American Colonization Society began subsidizing free black people to colonize the west coast of Africa. In 1822, it declared the colony of Liberia, which became independent in 1847. By 1857, Liberia had merged with other colonies formed by state societies, including the Republic of Maryland, Mississippi-in-Africa, and Kentucky in Africa.

President James Monroe presented his famous doctrine for the western hemisphere in 1823. Historians have observed that while the Monroe Doctrine contained a commitment to resist colonialism from Europe, it had some aggressive implications for American policy, since there were no limitations on the US&#x27;s actions mentioned within it. Historian Jay Sexton notes that the tactics used to implement the doctrine were modeled after those employed by European imperial powers during the 17th and 18th centuries. From the left historian William Appleman Williams described it as &quot;imperial anti-colonialism.&quot;

In the older historiography William Walker&#x27;s filibustering represented the high tide of antebellum American imperialism. His brief seizure of Nicaragua in 1855 is typically called a representative expression of Manifest destiny with the added factor of trying to expand slavery into Central America. Walker failed in all his escapades and never had official U.S. backing. Historian Michel Gobat, however, presents a strongly revisionist interpretation. He argues that Walker was invited in by Nicaraguan liberals who were trying to force economic modernization and political liberalism. Walker&#x27;s government comprised those liberals, as well as Yankee colonizers, and European radicals. Walker even included some local Catholics as well as indigenous peoples, Cuban revolutionaries, and local peasants. His coalition was much too complex and diverse to survive long, but it was not the attempted projection of American power, concludes Gobat.

The Indian Wars against the indigenous peoples of the Americas began in the colonial era. Their escalation under the federal republic allowed the US to dominate North America and carve out the 48 contiguous states. This can be considered to be an explicitly colonial process in light of arguments that Native American nations were sovereign entities prior to annexation. Their sovereignty was systematically undermined by US state policy (usually involving unequal or broken treaties) and white settler-colonialism. Furthermore, following the Dawes Act of 1887 native american systems of land tenure and communal ownership were ended, in favour of private property and capitalism. This resulted in the loss of around 100 Million acres of land from 1887 to 1934.

=== 1890s–1900s: New Imperialism and &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; ===

A variety of factors converged during the &quot;New Imperialism&quot; of the late 19th century, when the United States and the other great powers rapidly expanded their overseas territorial possessions. One of these factors was the prevalence of overt racism, notably John Fiske&#x27;s conception of &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; racial superiority and Josiah Strong&#x27;s call to &quot;civilize and Christianize.&quot; The concepts were manifestations of a growing Social Darwinism and racism in some schools of American political thought.

Early in his career, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the Spanish–American War and was an enthusiastic proponent of testing the U.S. military in battle, at one point stating &quot;I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.&quot; Roosevelt claimed that he rejected imperialism, but he embraced the near-identical doctrine of expansionism. When Rudyard Kipling wrote the imperialist poem &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; for Roosevelt, the politician told colleagues that it was &quot;rather poor poetry, but good sense from the expansion point of view.&quot; Roosevelt proclaimed his own corollary to the Monroe Doctrine as justification, although his ambitions extended even further, into the Far East. 

Scholars have noted the resemblance between U.S. policies in the Philippines and European actions in their colonies in Asia and Africa during this period. By one contrast, however, the United States claimed to colonize in the name of anti-colonialism: &quot;We are coming, Cuba, coming; we are bound to set you free! We are coming from the mountains, from the plains and inland sea! We are coming with the wrath of God to make the Spaniards flee! We are coming, Cuba, coming; coming now!&quot; Filipino revolutionary General Emilio Aguinaldo wondered: &quot;The Filipinos fighting for Liberty, the American people fighting them to give them liberty. The two peoples are fighting on parallel lines for the same object.&quot; However, from 1898 until the Cuban revolution, The United States of America had significant influence over the economy of Cuba. By 1950, US investors owned 44 of the 161 sugar mills in Cuba, and slightly over 47% of total sugar output. By 1906, up to 15% of Cuba was owned by American landowners. This consisted of 632,000 acres of sugar lands, 225,000 acres of tobacco, 700,000 of fruits and 2,750,000 acres of mining land, along with a quarter of the banking industry.

Industry and trade were two of the most prevalent justifications of imperialism. American intervention in both Latin America and Hawaii resulted in multiple industrial investments, including the popular industry of Dole bananas. If the United States was able to annex a territory, in turn they were granted access to the trade and capital of those territories. In 1898, Senator Albert Beveridge proclaimed that an expansion of markets was absolutely necessary, &quot;American factories are making more than the American people can use; American soil is producing more than they can consume. Fate has written our policy for us; the trade of the world must and shall be ours.&quot;
American rule of ceded Spanish territory was not uncontested. The Philippine Revolution had begun in August 1896 against Spain, and after the defeat of Spain in the Battle of Manila Bay, began again in earnest, culminating in the Philippine Declaration of Independence and the establishment of the First Philippine Republic. The Philippine–American War ensued, with extensive damage and death, ultimately resulting in the defeat of the Philippine Republic.

The United States&#x27; interests in Hawaii began in the 1800s with the United States becoming concerned that Great Britain or France might have colonial ambitions on the Hawaiian Kingdom. In 1849 the United States and The Kingdom of Hawaii signed a treaty of friendship removing any colonial ambitions Great Britain or France might have had. In 1885, King David Kalākaua, last king of Hawaii, signed a trade reciprocity treaty with the United States allowing for tariff free trade of sugar to the United States. The treaty was renewed in 1887 and with it came the overrunning of Hawaiian politics by rich, white, plantation owners. On July 6, 1887, the Hawaiian League, a non-native political group, threatened the king and forced him to sign a new constitution stripping him of much of his power. King Kalākaua would die in 1891 and be succeeded by his sister Lili&#x27;uokalani. In 1893 with support from marines from the USS &quot;Boston&quot; Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani would be deposed in a bloodless coup. Hawaii has been under US control ever since and became the 50th US state on August 21, 1959 in a joint resolution with Alaska.

Stuart Creighton Miller says that the public&#x27;s sense of innocence about &quot;Realpolitik&quot; impairs popular recognition of U.S. imperial conduct. The resistance to actively occupying foreign territory has led to policies of exerting influence via other means, including governing other countries via surrogates or puppet regimes, where domestically unpopular governments survive only through U.S. support.

The Philippines is sometimes cited as an example. After Philippine independence, the US continued to direct the country through Central Intelligence Agency operatives like Edward Lansdale. As Raymond Bonner and other historians note, Lansdale controlled the career of President Ramon Magsaysay, going so far as to physically beat him when the Philippine leader attempted to reject a speech the CIA had written for him. American agents also drugged sitting President Elpidio Quirino and prepared to assassinate Senator Claro Recto. Prominent Filipino historian Roland G. Simbulan has called the CIA &quot;US imperialism&#x27;s clandestine apparatus in the Philippines&quot;.

The U.S. retained dozens of military bases, including a few major ones. In addition, Philippine independence was qualified by legislation passed by the U.S. Congress. For example, the Bell Trade Act provided a mechanism whereby U.S. import quotas might be established on Philippine articles which &quot;are coming, or are likely to come, into substantial competition with like articles the product of the United States&quot;. It further required U.S. citizens and corporations be granted equal access to Philippine minerals, forests, and other natural resources. In hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs William L. Clayton described the law as &quot;clearly inconsistent with the basic foreign economic policy of this country&quot; and &quot;clearly inconsistent with our promise to grant the Philippines genuine independence.&quot;

=== 1918: Wilsonian intervention ===
When World War I broke out in Europe, President Woodrow Wilson promised American neutrality throughout the war. This promise was broken when the United States entered the war after the Zimmermann Telegram. This was &quot;a war for empire&quot; to control vast raw materials in Africa and other colonized areas, according to the contemporary historian and civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois. More recently historian Howard Zinn argues that Wilson entered the war in order to open international markets to surplus US production. He quotes Wilson&#x27;s own declaration that
In a memo to Secretary of State Bryan, the president described his aim as &quot;an open door to the world&quot;. Lloyd Gardner notes that Wilson&#x27;s original avoidance of world war was not motivated by anti-imperialism; his fear was that &quot;white civilization and its domination in the world&quot; were threatened by &quot;the great white nations&quot; destroying each other in endless battle.

Despite President Wilson&#x27;s official doctrine of moral diplomacy seeking to &quot;make the world safe for democracy,&quot; some of his activities at the time can be viewed as imperialism to stop the advance of democracy in countries such as Haiti. The United States invaded Haiti on July 28, 1915, and American rule continued until August 1, 1934. The historian Mary Renda in her book, &quot;Taking Haiti&quot;, talks about the American invasion of Haiti to bring about political stability through U.S. control. The American government did not believe Haiti was ready for self-government or democracy, according to Renda. In order to bring about political stability in Haiti, the United States secured control and integrated the country into the international capitalist economy, while preventing Haiti from practicing self-governance or democracy. While Haiti had been running their own government for many years before American intervention, the U.S. government regarded Haiti as unfit for self-rule. In order to convince the American public of the justice in intervening, the United States government used paternalist propaganda, depicting the Haitian political process as uncivilized. The Haitian government would come to agree to U.S. terms, including American overseeing of the Haitian economy. This direct supervision of the Haitian economy would reinforce U.S. propaganda and further entrench the perception of Haitians&#x27; being incompetent of self-governance.

In World War I, the US, Britain, and Russia had been allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November. Active distrust surfaced immediately, as even before the October Revolution British officers had been involved in the Kornilov Affair, an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by the Russian Army against the Provisional Government. Nonetheless, once the Bolsheviks took Moscow, the British government began talks to try and keep them in the war effort. British diplomat Bruce Lockhart cultivated a relationship with several Soviet officials, including Leon Trotsky, and the latter approved the initial Allied military mission to secure the Eastern Front, which was collapsing in the revolutionary upheaval. Ultimately, Soviet head of state V.I. Lenin decided the Bolsheviks would settle peacefully with the Central Powers at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This separate peace led to Allied disdain for the Soviets, since it left the Western Allies to fight Germany without a strong Eastern partner. The Secret Intelligence Service, supported by US diplomat Dewitt C. Poole, sponsored an attempted coup in Moscow involving Bruce Lockhart and Sidney Reilly, which involved an attempted assassination of Lenin. The Bolsheviks proceeded to shut down the British and U.S. embassies.

Tensions between Russia (including its allies) and the West turned intensely ideological. Horrified by mass executions of White forces, land expropriations, and widespread repression, the Allied military expedition now assisted the anti-Bolshevik Whites in the Russian Civil War, with the US covertly giving support to the autocratic and antisemitic General Alexander Kolchak. Over 30,000 Western troops were deployed in Russia overall. This was the first event that made Russian–American relations a matter of major, long-term concern to the leaders in each country. Some historians, including William Appleman Williams and Ronald Powaski, trace the origins of the Cold War to this conflict.

Wilson launched seven armed interventions, more than any other president. Looking back on the Wilson era, General Smedley Butler, a leader of the Haiti expedition and the highest-decorated Marine of that time, considered virtually all of the operations to have been economically motivated. In a 1933 speech he said:

=== 1920s–1930s ===

Following World War I, the British maintained occupation of the Middle East, most notably Turkey and portions of formerly Ottoman territory following the empire&#x27;s collapse. The occupation led to rapid industrialization, which resulted in the discovery of crude oil in Persia in 1908, sparking a boom in the Middle Eastern economy.

By the 1930s, the United States had cemented itself in the Middle East via a series of acquisitions through the Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), which saw US control over Saudi oil.

It was clear to the US that further expansion in Middle Eastern oil would not be possible without diplomatic representation. In 1939, CASOC appealed to the US State Department about increasing political relations with Saudi Arabia. This appeal was ignored until Germany and Japan made similar attempts following the start of World War II.

=== 1941–1945: World War II ===
At the start of World War II, the US had multiple territories in the Pacific. The majority of these territories were military bases like Midway, Guam, Wake Island and Hawaii. Japan&#x27;s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was what ended up bringing the United States into the war. Japan also launched multiple attacks on other American Territories like Guam and Wake Island. By early 1942 Japan also was able to take over the Philippine islands. At the end of the Philippine island campaign the general MacArthur stated &quot;I came through and I shall return&quot; in response to the Americans losing the island to the Japanese. The loss of American territories ended the decisive Battle of Midway. The Battle of Midway was the American offensive to stop Midway Island from falling into Japanese control. This led to the pushback of American forces and the recapturing of American territories. There were many battles that were fought against the Japanese which retook both allied territory as well as took over Japanese territories. In October 1944 American started their plan to retake the Philippine islands. Japanese troops on the island ended up surrendering in August 1945. After the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945, the United States occupied and reformed Japan up until 1952. The maximum geographical extension of American direct political and military control happened in the aftermath of World War II, in the period after the surrender and occupations of Germany and Austria in May and later Japan and Korea in September 1945 and before the United States granted the Philippines independence on July 4, 1946.

====The Grand Area====
In an October 1940 report to Franklin Roosevelt, Bowman wrote that &quot;the US government is interested in any solution anywhere in the world that affects American trade. In a wide sense, commerce is the mother of all wars.&quot; In 1942 this economic globalism was articulated as the &quot;Grand Area&quot; concept in secret documents. The US would have to have control over the &quot;Western Hemisphere, Continental Europe and Mediterranean Basin (excluding Russia), the Pacific Area and the Far East, and the British Empire (excluding Canada).&quot; The Grand Area encompassed all known major oil-bearing areas outside the Soviet Union, largely at the behest of corporate partners like the Foreign Oil Committee and the Petroleum Industry War Council. The US thus avoided overt territorial acquisition, like that of the European colonial empires, as being too costly, choosing the cheaper option of forcing countries to open their door to American business interests.

Although the United States was the last major belligerent to join the Second World War, it began planning for the post-war world from the conflict&#x27;s outset. This postwar vision originated in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), an economic elite-led organization that became integrated into the government leadership. CFR&#x27;s War and Peace Studies group offered its services to the State Department in 1939 and a secret partnership for post-war planning developed. CFR leaders Hamilton Fish Armstrong and Walter H. Mallory saw World War II as a &quot;grand opportunity&quot; for the U.S. to emerge as &quot;the premier power in the world.&quot;

This vision of empire assumed the necessity of the US to &quot;police the world&quot; in the aftermath of the war. This was not done primarily out of altruism, but out of economic interest. Isaiah Bowman, a key liaison between the CFR and the State Department, proposed an &quot;American economic Lebensraum.&quot; This built upon the ideas of Time-Life publisher Henry Luce, who (in his &quot;American Century&quot; essay) wrote, &quot;Tyrannies may require a large amount of living space [but] freedom requires and will require far greater living space than Tyranny.&quot; According to Bowman&#x27;s biographer, Neil Smith:

FDR promised: Hitler will get lebensraum, a global American one.

=== 1947–1952: Cold War in Western Europe===
Prior to his death in 1945, President Roosevelt was planning to withdraw all U.S. forces from Europe as soon as possible. Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia led his successor Harry Truman to reconsider. Heavily influenced by George Kennan, Washington policymakers believed that the Soviet Union was an expansionary dictatorship that threatened American interests. In their theory, Moscow&#x27;s weakness was that it had to keep expanding to survive; and that, by containing or stopping its growth, stability could be achieved in Europe. The result was the Truman Doctrine (1947). Initially regarding only Greece and Turkey, the NSC-68 (1951) extended the Truman Doctrine to the whole non-Communist world. The United States could no longer distinguish between national and global security. Hence, the Truman Doctrine was described as &quot;globalizing&quot; the Monroe Doctrine.

A second equally important consideration was the need to restore the world economy, which required the rebuilding and reorganizing of Europe for growth. This matter, more than the Soviet threat, was the main impetus behind the Marshall Plan of 1948.

A third factor was the realization, especially by Britain and the three Benelux nations, that American military involvement was needed. Geir Lundestad has commented on the importance of &quot;the eagerness with which America&#x27;s friendship was sought and its leadership welcomed... In Western Europe, America built an empire &#x27;by invitation&#x27;&quot; According to Lundestad, the U.S. interfered in Italian and French politics in order to purge elected communist officials who might oppose such invitations.

===1950–1959: Cold War outside Europe===
The end of the Second World War and start of the Cold War saw increased US interest in Latin America. Since the Guatemalan Revolution, Guatemala saw the expansion of labour rights and land reforms which granted property to landless peasants. Lobbying by the United Fruit Company, whose profits were affected by these policies, as well as fear of Communist influence in Guatemala culminated in the USA supporting Operation PBFortune to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in 1952. The plan involved providing weapons to the exiled Guatemalan military officer Carlos Castillo Armas, who was to lead an invasion from Nicaragua.
This culminated in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état. The subsequent military junta assumed dictatorial powers, banned opposition parties and reversed the social reforms of the revolution. The USA would continue to support Guatemala through the Cold War, including during the Guatemalan Genocide in which up to 200,000 people were killed. After the coup, American enterprises saw a return of influence in the country, in both the public level of government but also in the economy.

On the March 15, 1951 the Iranian parliament, passed legislation that was proposed by Mohammad Mosaddegh to nationalize the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which gained significant revenues from Iranian oil, more so than the Iranian government itself. Mosaddegh was elected Prime Minister by the Majlis later in 1952. Mosadeggh&#x27;s support by the Tudeh as well as a boycott by various businesses against the nationalised industry resulted in fears by the United Kingdom and the United States that Iran would turn to Communism. America would officially remain neutral, but the CIA supported various candidates in the 1952 Iranian legislative election.

In late 1952, with Mosaddegh remaining in power, the CIA launched Operation Ajax with support by the United Kingdom to overthrow Mosaddegh. The coup saw an increase in power of the monarchy, which went from a constitutional monarchy to an authoritarian nation. In the aftermath of the coup, the Shah agreed to replace the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium—British Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies. In August 2013, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.

===1945–1970: Asia-Pacific===
In Korea, the U.S. occupied the Southern half of the peninsula in 1945 and dissolved the Socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. After which, the USA quickly allied with Syngman Rhee, leader of the fight against the People&#x27;s Republic of Korea that proclaimed a provisional government. There was a lot of opposition to the division of Korea, including rebellions by communists such as the Jeju uprising in 1948 and further Communist partisans in the Korean War. The Jeju Uprising was violently suppressed and led to the deaths of 30,000 people, the majority of them civilians. North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, starting the Korean War. With National Security Council document 68 and the subsequent Korean War, the U.S. adopted a policy of &quot;rollback&quot; against communism in Asia. John Tirman, an American political theorist has claimed that this policy was heavily influenced by America&#x27;s imperialistic policy in Asia in the 19th century, with its goals to Christianize and Americanize the peasant masses. In the following conflict, the USA oversaw a large bombing campaign over North Korea. A total of 635,000 tons of bombs, including 32,557 tons of napalm, were dropped on Korea.

In Vietnam, the U.S. eschewed its anti-imperialist rhetoric by materially supporting the French Empire in a colonial counterinsurgency. Influenced by the Grand Area policy, the U.S. eventually assumed military and financial support for the South Vietnamese state against the Vietnamese communists following the first First Indochina war. The US and South Vietnam feared Ho Chi Minh would win nationwide elections. They both refused to sign agreements at the 1954 Geneva Conference arguing that fair elections weren&#x27;t possible in North Vietnam. Beginning in 1965, the US sent many combat units to fight Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers in South Vietnam, with fighting extending to North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. During the war Martin Luther King Jr. called the American government &quot;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.&quot; Initially based on stopping the spread of Communism into South Vietnam, the war and its motivations slowly began to lose its momentum in justifying the damage the war was causing to both sides. Particularly on the home front, where by 1970, two thirds of the American public advocated against the war.

The Vietnam War also saw expansion of conflict into neighbouring Laos and Cambodia. Both of which saw extensive bombing campaigns under Operation Barrel Roll, which made Laos &quot;the most heavily bombed nation in history&quot;, Operation Menu and Operation Freedom Deal.

After the deaths of six generals in the Indonesian Army, which Suharto blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia and a failed coup attempt by the 30 September Movement, an Anti-Communist purge began across the country led by Suharto and the army. The subsequent killings resulted in the deaths of up to 1,000,000 people. Though some estimates claim a death toll of 2 or 3 Million. Ethnic Chinese, trade unionists, teachers, activists, artists, ethnic Javanese Abangan, ethnic Chinese, atheists, so-called &quot;unbelievers&quot;, and alleged leftists were also among targeted groups in the killings.
Geoffrey B. Robinson, professor of history at UCLA, argued that powerful foreign states, in particular the United States, Great Britain and their allies, were instrumental in facilitating and encouraging the Indonesian Army&#x27;s campaign of mass killing, and without such support, the killings would not have happened. The political changes that came with the mass-killings not only resulted in the purge of the Communist Party, but also a shift in Indonesia&#x27;s foreign policy towards the West and capitalism. Furthermore, the mass-killings resulted in the expansion of American markets into Indonesia. By 1967, companies such as Freeport Sulphur, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, General Electric, American Express, Caterpillar Inc., StarKist, Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin, began to explore business opportunities in Indonesia.
Declassified documents released by the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in October 2017 stated that the U.S. government had detailed knowledge of the massacres from the start. The documents revealed that the U.S. government actively encouraged and facilitated the Indonesian Army&#x27;s massacres to further its geopolitical interests in the region.

===1970s–1980s: Latin American regime change===
From 1968 until 1989, the United States of America supported a campaign of political repression and state terrorism involving intelligence operations, CIA-backed coup d&#x27;états, and assassinations of left-wing and socialist leaders in South America as part of Operation Condor. It was officially implemented in November 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

===1990 onward===

==== Gulf War ====

Professor George Klay Kieh Jr. argued that part of the motivation for the Gulf War was derived from a desire to distract from the various crisis&#x27; in America at the time, such as the Keating Five, national debt rising to $3 Trillion, an increasing trade deficit, unemployment, rising crime and growing wealth inequality. He also argued that other very significant motivating factors for the war were strategic factors, such as a fear of subsequent invasion of Saudi Arabia and other Pro-American monarchies in Arabia. Iraqi control over the Gulf region was also feared to harm access to the United States to a major corridor of international trade. Professor Kieh also argued for various economic factors behind the invasion. The Bush Administration calculated that Iraq&#x27;s annexation of Kuwait would result in it controlling up to 45% of global oil production and since major banks such as Bank of America had significant stakes in the oil industry (various Gulf states saved more than $75 Billion in American banks), there were fears of a potential economic crisis due to the annexation.

==== Iraq War ====

The American invasion of Iraq has been cited by William Robinson as an instance of imperialism in which the beneficiaries of imperial conquest were transnational capitalist groups where the goal of the Iraq war was not political annexation, but rather the economic subjugation of Iraq and its incorporation into the global economy. Robinson draws specific attention to Order 39 where after taking control of Iraq in 2003, the America occupation force dismantled the previous Iraqi economy in favour of full privatization in Iraq and the permitting of 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets thereby strengthening the positions of foreign businesses and investors. 

====2011 Intervention in Libya====
In 2011, as part of the wider Arab Spring, protests erupted in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi, which soon spiralled into a civil war. In the ensuing conflict, a NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. While the effort was initially largely led by France and the United Kingdom, command was shared with the United States, as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. According to the Libyan Health Ministry, the attacks saw 114 civilians killed and 445 civilians wounded.

Matteo Capasso argued that the 2011 military intervention in Libya was &quot;US-led imperialism&quot; and the final conclusion in a wider war on Libya since the 1970s via &#x27;gunboat diplomacy, military bombings, international sanctions and arbitrary use of international law&#x27;. Capasso argued that the war in Libya acted to strip Libya of its autonomy and resources and the &#x27;overall weakening and fragmentation of the African and Arab political position, and the cheapening and/or direct annihilation of human lives in Third World countries&#x27;.

====American expansionism under Donald Trump====
== Strategy ==
=== U.S. military alliances ===
The architect of Containment, George Kennan, designed in 1948 a globe-circling system of anti-Russian alliances embracing all non-Communist countries of the Old World. The design was met by the US administration with enthusiasm. Disregarding George Washington&#x27;s dictum of avoiding entangling alliances, in the early Cold War the United States contracted 44 formal alliances and many other forms of commitment with nearly 100 countries, most of the world countries. Some observers described the process as &quot;pactomania.&quot;

According to Max Ostrovsky, these are not alliances in the Westphalian sense characterized by balance of power and impermanence. Instead, they were associated with the Roman client system during the late Republic. Scholars label the US network of alliances as &quot;hub-and-spokes&quot; system where the United States is the &quot;hub.&quot; Spokes do not directly interrelate between and among themselves, but all are bound to the same hub. The &quot;hub-and-spokes&quot; analogy is used in the comparative studies of empires. By contrast to earlier empires, however, the American &quot;imperial&quot; presence was largely welcome. Ostrovsky says that although all earlier empires, especially persistent empires, were in a measure by bargain, cooperation and invitation, in the post-1945 world this took an extreme form. Disregarding national pride, large number of states, some of them recent great powers, &quot;surrender their strategic sovereignty &quot;en mass[sic]&quot;.&quot; According to Ostrovsky, they host hegemonic bases, partly cover the expenses for running them, integrate their strategic forces under the hegemonic command, contribute 1-2% of their GDP to those forces, and tip military, economic and humanitarian contributions in case of the hegemonic operations worldwide.

=== U.S. military bases ===


During World War II, Franklin Roosevelt promised that the American eagle will &quot;fly high and strike hard.&quot; But he can only do so if he has safe perches around the world. Initially, the Army and Navy disagreed. But the leading expert on &quot;flying high and striking hard,&quot; Curtis LeMay, endorsed: &quot;We needed to establish bases within reasonable range; then we could bomb and burn them until they quit.&quot; After the War, a global network of bases emerged. NCS-162/2 of 1953 stated: &quot;The military striking power necessary to retaliate depends for the foreseeable future on having bases in allied countries.&quot; The bases were defined as nation&#x27;s strategic frontier defining a sphere of American inviolate military predominance. Chalmers Johnson argued in 2004 that America&#x27;s version of the colony is the military base. Chip Pitts argued similarly in 2006 that enduring U.S. bases in Iraq suggested a vision of &quot;Iraq as a colony.&quot;

In his New Frontier speech in 1960, John F. Kennedy noted that America&#x27;s frontiers are on every continent. Circling the Sino-Soviet bloc with bases resulted in a network of global dimensions. Contemplating its genesis, an observer wondered: What two places in the world have less in common than the frozen Thule and tropical Guam half a way around the world? Both happened to be principal operating areas of the Strategic Air Command. On Guam, a common joke had it that few people other than nuclear targeters in the Kremlin know where their island is.

While territories such as Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico remain under U.S. control, the U.S. allowed many of its overseas territories or occupations to gain independence after World War II. Examples include the Philippines (1946), the Panama Canal Zone (1979), Palau (1981), the Federated States of Micronesia (1986), and the Marshall Islands (1986). Most of them still have U.S. bases within their territories. In the case of Okinawa, which came under U.S. administration after the Battle of Okinawa during the Second World War, this happened despite local popular opinion on the island. In 2003, a Department of Defense distribution found the United States had bases in over 36 countries worldwide, including the Camp Bondsteel base in the disputed territory of Kosovo. Since 1959, Cuba has regarded the U.S. presence in Guantánamo Bay as illegal.

As of 2024, the United States deploys approximately 160,000 of its active-duty personnel outside the United States and its territories. In 2015 the Department of Defense reported the number of bases that had any military or civilians stationed or employed was 587. This includes land only (where no facilities are present), facility or facilities only (where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government), and land with facilities (where both are present). Also in 2015, David Vine&#x27;s book &quot;Base Nation&quot;, found 800 U.S. military bases located outside of the U.S., including 174 bases in Germany, 113 in Japan, and 83 in South Korea. The total cost was estimated at $100 billion a year.

Similarly, associates American author Robert D. Kaplan, the Roman garrisons were established to defend the frontiers of the empire and for surveillance of the areas beyond. For Historian Max Ostrovsky and International Law scholar Richard A. Falk, this is contrast rather than similarity: &quot;this time there are no frontiers and no areas beyond. The global strategic reach is unprecedented in world history phenomenon.&quot; &quot;The United States is by circumstance and design an emerging global empire, the first in the history of the world.&quot; Robert Kagan inscribed over the map of US global deployments: &quot;The Sun never sets.&quot;

===Unified combatant command===
The global network of military alliances and bases is coordinated by the Unified combatant command (UCC).
As of 2024, the world is divided between six geographic &quot;commands.&quot; The origins of the UCC is rooted in World War II with its global scale and two main theaters half-a-world apart. As in the case of military alliances and bases, the UCC was founded to wage the Cold War but long outlived this confrontation and expanded.

Dick Cheney, who served as Secretary of Defense during the end of the Cold War, announced: &quot;The strategic command, control and communication system should continue to evolve toward a joint global structure…&quot; The continuation of the strategic pattern implied for some that &quot;the United States would hold to its accidental hegemony.&quot; In 1998, the UCC determined the Soviet &quot;succession&quot;: the former Soviet Republics in Europe and the whole of Russia were assigned to the USEUCOM and those of the Central Asia to the USCENTCOM. USEUCOM stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

In 2002, for the first time, the entire surface of the Earth was divided among the US commands. The last unassigned region—Antarctica—entered the USPACOM which stretched from Pole to Pole and covered half of the globe; the rest of geographic commands covered the other half. Historian Christopher Kelly asked in 2002: What America needs to consider is &quot;what is the optimum size for a non-territorial empire.&quot; His colleague, Max Ostrovsky, replied: &quot;Precisely that year, the UCC supplied a precise answer: 510 million km2…&quot;

Canadian Historian, Michael Ignatieff, claims that the UCC map conveys the idea of the architecture underlying the entire global order and explaining how this order is sustained. The US national defense evolves into global defense. The &quot;Quadrennial Defense Review&quot; of 2014 refers to &quot;our global Combatant Commanders,&quot; that is &quot;our&quot; and &quot;global&quot; at the same time. These Commanders exercise heavy international influence and sometimes are associated with the Roman proconsuls (chapter &quot;&#x27;Empire&#x27; and alternative terms&quot; below). 

&quot;Command,&quot; translated into Latin, renders &quot;imperium.&quot; The Romans used the word &quot;command&quot; for their sphere of rule containing nominally independent states. Later, the word &quot;imperium&quot; lost its original meaning of &quot;command&quot; and obtained the meaning of &quot;empire.&quot;

==Factors==
===American exceptionalism===

On the ideological level, one motif for the global leadership is the notion of American exceptionalism. The United States occupies a special position among the nations of the world in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, and political and religious institutions and origins. Philosopher Douglas Kellner traces the identification of American exceptionalism as a distinct phenomenon back to 19th-century French observer Alexis de Tocqueville, who concluded by agreeing that the U.S., uniquely, was &quot;proceeding along a path to which no limit can be perceived&quot;. As a &quot;Monthly Review&quot; editorial opines on the phenomenon, &quot;In Britain, empire was justified as a benevolent &#x27;white man&#x27;s burden.&#x27; And in the United States, empire does not even exist; &#x27;we&#x27; are merely protecting the causes of freedom, democracy and justice worldwide.&quot; Fareed Zakaria stressed one element not exceptional for the American Empire—the concept of exceptionalism. All dominant empires thought they were special.

===Economic interests===


A &quot;social-democratic&quot; theory says that imperialistic U.S. policies are the products of the excessive influence of certain sectors of U.S. business and government—the arms industry in alliance with military and political bureaucracies and sometimes other industries such as oil and finance, a combination often referred to as the &quot;military–industrial complex.&quot; The complex is said to benefit from war profiteering and looting natural resources, often at the expense of the public interest. The proposed solution is typically unceasing popular vigilance in order to apply counter-pressure. Chalmers Johnson holds a version of this view.

Alfred Thayer Mahan, who served as an officer in the U.S. Navy during the late 19th century, supported the notion of American imperialism in his 1890 book titled &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History.&quot; Mahan argued that modern industrial nations must secure foreign markets for the purpose of exchanging goods and, consequently, they must maintain a maritime force that is capable of protecting these trade routes.

A theory of &quot;super-imperialism&quot; argues that imperialistic U.S. policies are not driven solely by the interests of American businesses, but also by the interests of a larger apparatus of a global alliance among the economic elite in developed countries. The argument asserts that capitalism in the Global North (Europe, Japan, Canada, and the U.S.) has become too entangled to permit military or geopolitical conflict between these countries, and the central conflict in modern imperialism is between the Global North (also referred to as the global core) and the Global South (also referred to as the global periphery), rather than between the imperialist powers. A conservative, anti-interventionist view as expressed by American journalist John T. Flynn:
=== Security ===
The last period of the US Isolationist policy ended with World War II. Due to the progress of military technology, it was argued, the Oceans stopped protecting. Ever since, this War is invoked as a lesson for permanent involvement in world politics. Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Bill Clinton repeated close versions of this lesson. If hostile powers are not checked from the beginning, the paradigm tells, they would gain control over vaster resources and eventually the United States would have to fight them when they are stronger.

The focus of this policy is on Eurasia. Since Alfred Thayer Mahan and until Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, the American geopolitical school claims it vital to prevent the Eurasian land mass from coming under control of any single power or combination of powers. Some scholars explain the Cold War by geopolitics rather than ideology. They stress that the US grand strategy designed for the Cold War long outlived the Soviet Communism.

September 11 is another example of security crisis which triggered greater intervention as well as unleashed mass publications on the &quot;American Empire&quot; accompanied by heated debates (see &quot;Post-September-11 debates&quot; below). The pattern of increasing involvement responding to security crises or threats is known as &quot;defensive imperialism&quot; in the Roman studies and Historian Max Ostrovsky applied the concept also to Qin and the United States. All three, he finds, began with isolationism using geographic barriers and gradually built their empires responding to growing external threats. The three strategic transformations are analogous—from isolationism to hegemony to empire—with the modern process being currently uncompleted.

==Views of American imperialism==
===U.S. foreign policy debate===

Annexation is a crucial instrument in the expansion of a nation, due to the fact that once a territory is annexed it must act within the confines of its superior counterpart. The United States Congress&#x27; ability to annex a foreign territory is explained in a report from the Congressional Committee on Foreign Relations, &quot;If, in the judgment of Congress, such a measure is supported by a safe and wise policy, or is based upon a natural duty that we owe to the people of Hawaii, or is necessary for our national development and security, that is enough to justify annexation, with the consent of the recognized government of the country to be annexed.&quot;

Prior to annexing a territory, the American government still held immense power through the various legislations passed in the late 1800s. The Platt Amendment was utilized to prevent Cuba from entering into any agreement with foreign nations and also granted the Americans the right to build naval stations on their soil. Executive officials in the American government began to determine themselves the supreme authority in matters regarding the recognition or restriction of independence.

Historian Donald W. Meinig says imperial behavior by the United States dates at least to the Louisiana Purchase, which he describes as an &quot;imperial acquisition—imperial in the sense of the aggressive encroachment of one people upon the territory of another, resulting in the subjugation of that people to alien rule.&quot; The U.S. policies towards the Native Americans, he said, were &quot;designed to remold them into a people more appropriately conformed to imperial desires.&quot;
Writers and academics of the early 20th century, like Charles A. Beard, in support of non-interventionism (sometimes referred to as &quot;isolationism&quot;), discussed American policy as being driven by self-interested expansionism going back as far as the writing of the Constitution. Many politicians today do not agree. Pat Buchanan claims that the modern United States&#x27; drive to empire is &quot;far removed from what the Founding Fathers had intended the young Republic to become.&quot;

In &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot;, the political activist Noam Chomsky argues that exceptionalism and the denials of imperialism are the result of a systematic strategy of propaganda, to &quot;manufacture opinion&quot; as the process has long been described in other countries. One of the earliest historians of American Empire, William Appleman Williams, wrote, &quot;The routine lust for land, markets or security became justifications for noble rhetoric about prosperity, liberty and security.&quot;

Andrew Bacevich argues that the U.S. did not fundamentally change its foreign policy after the Cold War, and remains focused on an effort to expand its control across the world. As the surviving superpower at the end of the Cold War, the U.S. could focus its assets in new directions, the future being &quot;up for grabs,&quot; according to former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz in 1991.

Since 2001, Emmanuel Todd assumes the U.S. cannot hold for long the status of mondial hegemonic power, due to limited resources. Instead, the U.S. is going to become just one of the major regional powers along with European Union, China, Russia, etc. Reviewing Todd&#x27;s &quot;After the Empire&quot;, G. John Ikenberry found that it had been written in &quot;a fit of French wishful thinking.&quot;

===Debate after September 11, 2001===

Following September 11, publications on the &quot;American Empire&quot; grew exponentially, accompanied by heated debates.
Harvard historian Charles S. Maier states:

Harvard professor Niall Ferguson states:
French political scientist Philip Golub argues:
Following the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the idea of American imperialism was re-examined. In November 2001, jubilant marines hoisted an American flag over Kandahar and in a stage display referred to the moment as the third after those on San Juan Hill and Iwo Jima. All moments, writes Neil Smith, express U.S. global ambition. &quot;Labelled a War on Terrorism, the new war represents an unprecedented quickening of the American Empire, a third chance at global power.&quot;

On October 15, 2001, the cover of Bill Kristol&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; carried the headline, &quot;The Case for American Empire&quot;. Rich Lowry, editor in chief of the National Review, called for &quot;a kind of low-grade colonialism&quot; to topple dangerous regimes beyond Afghanistan. The columnist Charles Krauthammer declared that, given complete U.S. domination &quot;culturally, economically, technologically and militarily&quot;, people were &quot;now coming out of the closet on the word &#x27;empire. The &quot;New York Times&quot; Sunday magazine cover for January 5, 2003, read &quot;American Empire: Get Used To It&quot;. The phrase &quot;American empire&quot; appeared more than 1000 times in news stories during November 2002 – April 2003.

A leading spokesman for America-as-Empire, British historian A. G. Hopkins, argues that by the 21st century traditional economic imperialism was no longer in play, noting that the oil companies opposed the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Instead, anxieties about the negative impact of globalization on rural and rust-belt America were at work, says Hopkins:


Harvard professor Niall Ferguson concludes that worldwide military and economic power have combined to make the U.S. the most powerful empire in history. It is a good idea he thinks, because like the successful British Empire in the 19th century it works to globalize free markets, enhance the rule of law and promote representative government. He fears, however, that Americans lack the long-term commitment in manpower and money to keep the Empire operating. Head of the Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard University, Stephen Peter Rosen, maintains:

The U.S. dollar is the &quot;de facto&quot; world currency. The term petrodollar warfare refers to the alleged motivation of U.S. foreign policy as preserving by force the status of the United States dollar as the world&#x27;s dominant reserve currency and as the currency in which oil is priced. The term was coined by William R. Clark, who has written a book with the same title. The phrase &quot;oil currency war&quot; is sometimes used with the same meaning.

When asked on April 28, 2003, on Al Jazeera whether the United States was &quot;empire building,&quot; Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld replied, &quot;We don&#x27;t seek empires. We&#x27;re not imperialistic. We never have been.&quot; Manyperhaps mostscholars have decided that the United States lacks the key essentials of an empire. For example, while there are American military bases around the world, the American soldiers do not rule over the local people, and the United States government does not send out governors or permanent settlers like all the historic empires did. Harvard historian Charles S. Maier has examined the America-as-Empire issue at length. He says the traditional understanding of the word &quot;empire&quot; does not apply, because the United States does not exert formal control over other nations or engage in systematic conquest. The best term is that the United States is a &quot;hegemon.&quot; Its enormous influence through high technology, economic power, and impact on popular culture gives it an international outreach that stands in sharp contrast to the inward direction of historic empires.

World historian Anthony Pagden asks, Is the United States really an empire?

In the book &quot;Empire&quot; (2000), Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue that &quot;the decline of Empire has begun&quot;. Hardt says the Iraq War is a classically imperialist war and is the last gasp of a doomed strategy. They expand on this, claiming that in the new era of imperialism, the classical imperialists retain a colonizing power of sorts, but the strategy shifts from military occupation of economies based on physical goods to a networked biopower based on an informational and affective economies. They go on to say that the U.S. is central to the development of this new regime of international power and sovereignty, termed &quot;Empire&quot;, but that it is decentralized and global, and not ruled by one sovereign state: &quot;The United States does indeed occupy a privileged position in Empire, but this privilege derives not from its similarities to the old European imperialist powers, but from its differences.&quot; Hardt and Negri draw on the theories of Baruch Spinoza, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Italian Autonomist Marxists.

Geographer David Harvey says there has emerged a new type of imperialism due to geographical distinctions as well as unequal rates of development. He says there have emerged three new global economic and political blocs: the United States, the European Union, and Asia centered on China and Russia. He says there are tensions between the three major blocs over resources and economic power, citing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the motive of which, he argues, was to prevent rival blocs from controlling oil. Furthermore, Harvey argues that there can arise conflict within the major blocs between business interests and the politicians due to their sometimes incongruent economic interests. Politicians live in geographically fixed locations and are, in the U.S. and Europe, accountable to an electorate. The &#x27;new&#x27; imperialism, then, has led to an alignment of the interests of capitalists and politicians in order to prevent the rise and expansion of possible economic and political rivals from challenging America&#x27;s dominance.

=== &quot;Empire&quot; and alternative terms ===
In one point of view, United States expansion overseas in the late 1890s has indeed been imperialistic, but that this imperialism is only a temporary phenomenon, a corruption of American ideals, or the relic of a past era. Historian Samuel Flagg Bemis argues that Spanish–American War expansionism was a short-lived imperialistic impulse and &quot;a great aberration in American history,&quot; a very different form of territorial growth than that of earlier American history. Historian Walter LaFeber sees the Spanish–American War expansionism not as an aberration, but as a culmination of United States expansion westward.

Thorton wrote that &quot;[...] imperialism is more often the name of the emotion that reacts to a series of events than a definition of the events themselves. Where colonization finds analysts and analogies, imperialism must contend with crusaders for and against.&quot; Liberal internationalists argue that even though the present world order is dominated by the United States, the form taken by that dominance is not imperial. International relations scholar John Ikenberry argues that international institutions have taken the place of empire. 

Classics professor and war historian Victor Davis Hanson argues that the U.S. does not pursue world domination, but maintains worldwide influence by a system of mutually beneficial exchanges. He dismisses the notion of an American Empire altogether, with a mocking comparison to historical empires: &quot;We do not send out proconsuls to reside over client states, which in turn impose taxes on coerced subjects to pay for the legions. Instead, American bases are predicated on contractual obligations — costly to us and profitable to their hosts. We do not see any profits in Korea, but instead accept the risk of losing almost 40,000 of our youth to ensure that Kias can flood our shores and that shaggy students can protest outside our embassy in Seoul.&quot;

The existence of &quot;proconsuls&quot;, however, has been recognized by many since the early Cold War. In 1957, French Historian Amaury de Riencourt associated the American &quot;proconsul&quot; with &quot;the Roman of our time.&quot; Expert on recent American history, Arthur M. Schlesinger, detected several contemporary imperial features, including &quot;proconsuls.&quot; Washington does not directly run many parts of the world. Rather, its &quot;informal empire&quot; was one &quot;richly equipped with imperial paraphernalia: troops, ships, planes, bases, proconsuls, local collaborators, all spread wide around the luckless planet.&quot; &quot;The Supreme Allied Commander, always an American, was an appropriate title for the American proconsul whose reputation and influence outweighed those of European premiers, presidents, and chancellors.&quot; U.S. &quot;combatant commanders ... have served as its proconsuls. Their standing in their regions has usually dwarfed that of ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state.&quot;
Harvard professor Niall Ferguson calls the regional combatant commanders, among whom the whole globe is divided, the &quot;pro-consuls&quot; of this &quot;imperium.&quot; Günter Bischof calls them &quot;the all powerful proconsuls of the new American empire. Like the proconsuls of Rome they were supposed to bring order and law to the unruly and anarchical world.&quot; In September 2000, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Dana Priest published a series of articles whose central premise was Combatant Commanders&#x27; inordinate amount of political influence within the countries in their areas of responsibility. They &quot;had evolved into the modern-day equivalent of the Roman Empire&#x27;s proconsuls—well-funded, semi-autonomous, unconventional centers of U.S. foreign policy.&quot; The Romans often preferred to exercise power through friendly client regimes, rather than direct rule: &quot;Until Jay Garner and L. Paul Bremer became U.S. proconsuls in Baghdad, that was the American method, too&quot;.

Another distinction of Victor Davis Hanson—that US bases, contrary to the legions, are costly to America and profitable for their hosts—expresses the American view. The hosts express a diametrically opposite view. Japan pays for 25,000 Japanese working on US bases. 20% of those workers provide entertainment: a list drawn up by the Japanese Ministry of Defense included 76 bartenders, 48 vending machine personnel, 47 golf course maintenance personnel, 25 club managers, 20 commercial artists, 9 leisure-boat operators, 6 theater directors, 5 cake decorators, 4 bowling alley clerks, 3 tour guides and 1 animal caretaker. Shu Watanabe of the Democratic Party of Japan asks: &quot;Why does Japan need to pay the costs for US service members&#x27; entertainment on their holidays?&quot; One research on host nations support concludes:
Increasing the &quot;economic burdens of the allies&quot; is one of the major priorities of President Donald Trump. Classicist Eric Adler notes that Hanson earlier had written about the decline of the classical studies in the United States and insufficient attention devoted to the classical experience. &quot;When writing about American foreign policy for a lay audience, however, Hanson himself chose to castigate Roman imperialism in order to portray the modern United States as different from—and superior to—the Roman state.&quot; As a supporter of a hawkish unilateral American foreign policy, Hanson&#x27;s &quot;distinctly negative view of Roman imperialism is particularly noteworthy, since it demonstrates the importance a contemporary supporter of a hawkish American foreign policy places on criticizing Rome.&quot;

Political theorist Michael Walzer argues that the term hegemony is better than empire to describe the U.S.&#x27;s role in the world. Hegemony is distinguished from empire as ruling only external but not internal affairs of other states. Political scientist Robert Keohane argues a &quot;balanced and nuanced analysis is not aided ... by the use of the word &#x27;empire&#x27; to describe United States hegemony, since &#x27;empire&#x27; obscures rather than illuminates the differences in form of governance between the United States and other Great Powers, such as Great Britain in the 19th century or the Soviet Union in the twentieth&quot;. Other political scientists, such as Daniel Nexon and Thomas Wright, argue that neither term exclusively describes foreign relations of the United States. The U.S. can be, and has been, simultaneously an empire and a hegemonic power. They claim that the general trend in U.S. foreign relations has been away from imperial modes of control.

=== Proponents===

Max Boot defends U.S. imperialism, writing, &quot;U.S. imperialism has been the greatest force for good in the world during the past century. It has defeated communism and Nazism and has intervened against the Taliban and Serbian ethnic cleansing.&quot; Boot used &quot;imperialism&quot; to describe United States policy, not only in the early 20th century but &quot;since at least 1803.&quot; This embrace of empire is made by other neoconservatives, including British historian Paul Johnson, and writers Dinesh D&#x27;Souza and Mark Steyn. It is also made by some liberal hawks, such as political scientists Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michael Ignatieff.

Scottish-American historian Niall Ferguson argues that the United States is an empire and believes that this is a good thing: &quot;What is not allowed is to say that the United States is an empire and that this might not be wholly bad.&quot; Ferguson has drawn parallels between the British Empire and the global role of the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, though he describes the United States&#x27; political and social structures as more like those of the Roman Empire than of the British. Ferguson argues that all of these empires have had both positive and negative aspects, but that the positive aspects of the U.S. empire will, if it learns from history and its mistakes, greatly outweigh its negative aspects.

===Role of Women in American Imperialism===
Within the United States, women played important roles in both advocating for and protesting against American imperialism. Women&#x27;s organisations and prominent figures actively supported and promoted the expansion of American influence overseas and saw imperialism as an opportunity to extend American values, culture, and civilization to other nations. These women believed in the superiority of American ideals and saw it as their duty to uplift and educate what they often perceived as &#x27;lesser&#x27; peoples. By endorsing imperialist policies, women aimed to spread democracy, Christianity, and Western progress to territories beyond American borders: their domestic advocacy created a narrative that framed imperialism as a mission of benevolence, wherein the United States had a responsibility to guide and shape the destiny of other nations.

During the era of American imperialism, women played a significant role in missionary work. Missionary societies sent women to various parts of the world, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific, with the aim of spreading Christianity and Western values. These women saw themselves as agents of cultural and religious transformation, seeking to &quot;civilize&quot; and &quot;Christianize&quot; indigenous populations. Their missionary efforts involved establishing schools, churches, hospitals, and orphanages in imperial territories; through these institutions, women aimed to improve the lives of local people, provide education, healthcare, and social services. Their work intertwined religious and imperialistic motives, as they believed that the spread of Christianity and Western values would uplift and transform the &quot;heathen&quot; populations they encountered.

Women played a crucial role in educational and social reform initiatives within imperial territories during the era of American imperialism. They established schools, hospitals, and orphanages, aiming to improve the lives of indigenous populations – initiatives reflecting a belief in the superiority of Western values and a desire to assimilate native cultures into American norms. Women also sought to provide education, healthcare, and social services that aligned with American ideals of progress and civilisation, and by promoting Western education and introducing social reforms, they hoped to shape the lives and future of the people they encountered in imperial territories. These efforts often entailed the imposition of Western cultural norms, as women saw themselves as agents of transformation and viewed indigenous practices as in need of improvement and &quot;upliftment&quot;.

Women also played important roles as nurses and medical practitioners during the era of American imperialism. Particularly during the Spanish–American War and subsequent American occupations, women provided healthcare services to soldiers, both American and local, and worked to improve public health conditions in occupied territories. These women played a vital role in caring for the wounded, preventing the spread of diseases, and providing medical assistance to communities affected by the conflicts. Their work as nurses and medical practitioners contributed to the establishment of healthcare infrastructure and the improvement of public health in imperial territories. These women worked tirelessly in often challenging conditions, dedicating themselves to the well-being and recovery of those affected by the conflicts.

While some women supported American imperialism, others actively participated in anti-imperialist movements and expressed opposition to expansionist policies. Women, including suffragettes and progressive activists, were critical of the imperialist practices of the United States. They challenged the notion that spreading democracy and civilization abroad could be achieved through the oppression and colonization of other peoples. These women believed in the principles of self-determination, sovereignty, and equality for all nations. They argued that true progress and justice could not be achieved through the subjugation of others, emphasising the need for cooperation and respect among nations. By raising their voices against imperialism, these women sought to promote a vision of global justice and equality.

Ultimately women&#x27;s activism played a significant role in challenging and shaping American imperialism. Throughout history, women activists have been at the forefront of anti-imperialist movements, questioning the motives and consequences of U.S. expansionism. Women&#x27;s organisations and prominent figures raised their voices against the injustices of imperialism, advocating for peace, human rights, and the self-determination of colonised peoples. They criticized the exploitation and oppression inherent in imperialistic practices, highlighting the disproportionate impact on marginalised communities. Women activists collaborated across borders, forging transnational alliances to challenge American dominance and promote global solidarity. By engaging in social and political activism, women contributed to a more nuanced understanding of imperialism, exposing its complexities and fostering dialogue on the ethical implications of empire.

Moreover, sexuality and attitudes towards gender roles and behaviour played an important role in American expansionism. Regarding the war in Vietnam, the idea of American &#x27;manliness&#x27; entered the conscience of those in support of ground involvement, pushing ideas of gender roles and that manly, American men shouldn&#x27;t avoid conflict. These ideas of sexuality extended as far as President Johnson, who wanted to be presented as a &#x27;hero statesman&#x27; to his people, highlighting further the effect of gender roles on both American domestic attitudes as well as foreign policy.

===American Empire and Capitalism===

Writers like William I. Robinson have characterised American empire since the 1980s and 1990s as one which is a front for the imperial designs of the American capitalist class, arguing that Washington D.C. has become the seat of the &#x27;empire of capital&#x27; from which nations are colonised and re-colonised.

== American media and cultural imperialism ==

American imperialism has long had a media dimension (media imperialism) and cultural dimension (cultural imperialism).

In &quot;Mass Communication and American Empire&quot;, Herbert I. Schiller emphasized the significance of the mass media and cultural industry to American imperialism, arguing that &quot;each new electronic development widens the perimeter of American influence,&quot; and declaring that &quot;American power, expressed industrially, militarily and culturally has become the most potent force on earth and communications have become a decisive element in the extension of United States world power.&quot;

In &quot;Communication and Cultural Domination&quot;, Schiller presented the premier definition of cultural imperialism asIn Schiller&#x27;s formulation of the concept, cultural imperialism refers to the American Empire&#x27;s &quot;coercive and persuasive agencies, and their capacity to promote and universalize an American &#x27;way of life&#x27; in other countries without any reciprocation of influence.&quot; According to Schiller, cultural imperialism &quot;pressured, forced and bribed&quot; societies to integrate with the U.S.&#x27;s expansive capitalist model but also incorporated them with attraction and persuasion by winning &quot;the mutual consent, even solicitation of the indigenous rulers.&quot;

Newer research on cultural imperialism sheds light on how the US national security state partners with media corporations to spread US foreign policy and military-promoting media goods around the world. In &quot;Hearts and Mines: The US Empire&#x27;s Culture Industry&quot;, Tanner Mirrlees builds upon the work of Herbert I. Schiller to argue that the US government and media corporations pursue different interests on the world stage (the former, national security, and the latter, profit), but structural alliances and the synergistic relationships between them support the co-production and global flow of Empire-extolling cultural and entertainment goods.

Some researchers argue that military and cultural imperialism are interdependent. Every war of Empire has relied upon a culture or &quot;way of life&quot; that supports it, and most often, with the idea that a country has a unique or special mission to spread its way of life around the world. Edward Said, one of the founders of post-colonial theory, said,

International relations scholar David Rothkopf disagrees with the notion that cultural imperialism is an intentional political or military process, and instead argues that it is the innocent result of economic globalization, which allows access to numerous U.S. and Western ideas and products that many non-U.S. and non-Western consumers across the world voluntarily choose to consume. Many countries with American brands have incorporated these into their own local culture. An example of this would be the self-styled &quot;Maccas,&quot; an Australian derivation of &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; with a tinge of Australian culture.

International relations scholar Joseph Nye argues that U.S. power is more and more based on &quot;soft power,&quot; which comes from cultural hegemony rather than raw military or economic force. This includes such factors as the widespread desire to emigrate to the United States, the prestige and corresponding high proportion of foreign students at U.S. universities, and the spread of U.S. styles of popular music and cinema. Mass immigration into America may justify this theory, but it is hard to know whether the United States would still maintain its prestige without its military and economic superiority., In terms of soft power, Giles Scott-Smith, argues that American universities:
: acted as magnets for attracting up-and-coming elites, who were keen to acquire the skills, qualifications and prestige that came with the &#x27;Made in the USA&#x27; trademark. This is a subtle, long-term form of &#x27;soft power&#x27; that has required only limited intervention by the US government to function successfully. It conforms to Samuel Huntington&#x27;s view that American power rarely sought to acquire foreign territories, preferring instead to penetrate them — culturally, economically and politically — in such a way as to secure acquiescence for US interests. 
Matthew Fraser argues that the American &quot;soft power&quot; and American global cultural influence is a good thing for other countries, and good for the world as a whole. Tanner Mirrlees argues that the discourse of &quot;soft power&quot; used by Matthew Fraser and others to promote American global cultural influence represents an &quot;apologia&quot; for cultural imperialism, a way of rationalizing it (while denying it).

== American expansion through artistic expression ==
America&#x27;s imperial mission was the subject of much critique and praise to the contemporary American, and this is evident through the art and media which emerged in the 1800s as a result of this expansion. The disparities in the art produced in this period show the differences in public opinion, thus allowing us to identify how different social spheres responded to America&#x27;s imperial endeavors.

The Hudson River School, a romantic-inspired art movement which emerged in 1826 at the height of nineteenth-century American expansion depicted sublime landscapes and grand natural scenes. These paintings which admired the marvels of unexplored American territory emphasized this idea of America as a promised land. Common themes explored among paintings within the Hudson River School include: discovery; exploration; settlement and promise.

These themes were recurrent in other displays of artistic expression at this time. John Gast, famously known for his 1872 painting titled &quot;American Progress&quot; similarly displays themes of discovery and the hopeful prospects of American expansion. Notions of manifest destiny is also emulated in art created in this time, with art often used to justify this belief that the White Man was inevitably destined to spread across the American continent.

In reality [...] ambitious foreigners infiltrat[ed] the United States. [A long] list of world leaders [...] trained Stateside [...[. [...] The C.I.A. interfered constantly in foreign politics, but its typical mode wasn&#x27;t micromanaging; it was subcontracting. [...] For all the heady talk of promoting democracy, more than two-thirds of U.S. covert interventions during the Cold War were in support of authoritarian regimes...&quot; (p. 56.) &quot;As the [1990s] wore on, U.S. leaders grew increasingly alarmed about [Iraq dictator] Saddam&#x27;s continued military capacities. But intelligence was wanting. [...] The combination of scant knowledge and overweening concern created demand, and [Ahmad] Chalabi arrange[d] the supply. He promoted sources who [falsely] claimed that Saddam was stockpiling chemical and biological weapons and had kept working toward nuclear ones. [...] In the end, the C.I.A. has the power to break things, but not the skill to build them.

[T]hey had no idea why they were there, and they didn&#x27;t really know what they were supposed to do there... The Vietnamese revolutionaries were fighting for their own country, for their own families. The Americans were not... Schell&#x27;s [subsequent] book could have... led American policymakers to realize that quasi-imperial American interventions [like this] could not succeed in the contemporary world... [M]aybe a million... Vietnamese lives could have been saved, along with the lives of 50,000 American soldiers, along with countless lives in Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot; (p. 17.)
* Tobar, Héctor, &quot;The Truths of Our American Empire&quot; (review of Jonathan Blitzer, &quot;Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here: The United States, Central America, and the Making of a Crisis&quot;, Penguin Press, 523 pp.), &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, vol. LXXI, no. 7 (18 April 2024), pp. 43–44, 46. &quot;Blitzer... illustrates the timidity and opportunism of the US political class, which has repeatedly blocked reforms that would allow an orderly and safe flow of workers and their families across the border. After all, our postpandemic economy remains desperately short of workers... [E]ven if every unemployed person in [the US] found work, roughly three million jobs would go unfilled.&quot; (p. 44, 46.) &quot;The use and abuse of immigrant labor as tools of nation building and race engineering is a long-established element of the American normal. Only if you step outside of history does it look like a &#x27;crisis.&#x27;&quot; (p. 46.) 
* Tooze, Adam, &quot;Is This the End of the American Century?&quot;, &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, vol. 41, no. 7 (4 April 2019), pp. 3, 5–7.
* Wertheim, Stephen, &quot;The Price of Primacy: Why America Shouldn&#x27;t Dominate the World&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, vol. 99, no. 2 (March/April 2020), pp. 19–22, 24–29. &quot;The United States should abandon the quest for armed primacy in favor of protecting the planet and creating more opportunity for more people.&quot; (p. 20.) &quot;The United States should [...] rally the industrialized world to provide developing countries with technology and financing to bypass fossil fuels.&quot; (p. 24.) &quot;[T]he United States should cease acting as a partisan in disputes such as Yemen&#x27;s civil war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [...].&quot; (p. 27.) 
* Wertheim, Stephen, &quot;Iraq and the Pathologies of Primacy: The Flawed Logic That Produced the War Is Alive and Well&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, vol. 102, no. 3 (May/June 2023), pp. 136–52. &quot;Washington is still in thrall to primacy and caught in a doom loop, lurching from self-inflicted problems to even bigger self-inflicted problems, holding up the latter while covering up the former. In this sense, the Iraq war remains unfinished business for the United States.&quot; (p. 152.)

<text>Pamela Lyndon Travers ( ; born Helen Lyndon Goff; 9 August 1899 – 23 April 1996) was an Australian-born British writer who spent most of her career in England. She is best known for the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; series of books, which feature the eponymous magical nanny.

Goff was born in Maryborough, Queensland, and grew up in the Australian bush before being sent to boarding school in Sydney. Her writing was first published when she was a teenager, and she also worked briefly as a professional Shakespearean actress. Upon emigrating to England at the age of 24, she took the name &quot;Pamela Lyndon Travers&quot; and adopted the pen name P. L. Travers in 1933 while writing the first of eight &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; books.

Travers travelled to New York City during World War II while working for the British Ministry of Information. At that time, Walt Disney contacted her about selling to Walt Disney Productions the rights for a film adaptation of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. After years of contact, which included visits to Travers at her home in London, Walt Disney obtained the rights and the film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; premiered in 1964. 

In 2004, a stage musical adaptation of the books and the film opened in the West End; it premiered on Broadway in 2006. A film based on Disney&#x27;s efforts to persuade Travers to sell him the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; film rights was released in 2013, &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot;, in which Travers is portrayed by Emma Thompson. In a 2018 sequel to the original film, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, Poppins, played by Emily Blunt, returns to help the Banks family once again.

== Early life ==
Helen Lyndon Goff, also known as Lyndon, was born on 9 August 1899 in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, at her family&#x27;s home, which was the upstairs manager&#x27;s residence at a bank in the city&#x27;s &quot;Central Business District (CBD)&quot;. This bank building, the Australian Joint Stock Bank Building, Maryborough is on the Queensland State Heritage Register.

Her mother, Margaret Agnes Goff (née Morehead), was Australian and the niece of Boyd Dunlop Morehead, Premier of Queensland from 1888 to 1890. Her father, Travers Robert Goff, was unsuccessful as a bank manager owing to his alcoholism, and was eventually demoted to the position of bank clerk. The two had been married on 9 November 1898, nine months before Helen was born. The name Helen came from a maternal great-grandmother and great-aunt. Although she was born in Australia, Goff considered herself Irish and later expressed the sentiment that her birth had been &quot;misplaced&quot;.

As a baby she visited her great aunt Ellie in Sydney for the first time; Ellie would figure prominently in her early life, as Goff often stayed with her. Goff lived a simple life as a child, given a penny a week by her parents as well as occasional other gifts. Her mother was known for giving Goff maxims and instructions while she loved &quot;the memory of her father&quot; and his stories of life in Ireland. Goff was also an avid reader, later stating that she could read at three years old, and particularly enjoying fairy tales.

The family lived in Maryborough until Goff was three years old, when they relocated to Brisbane in 1902. Goff recalled an idealised version of her childhood in Maryborough as an adult. In Brisbane, Goff&#x27;s sister was born. In mid-1905 Goff went to spend time with Ellie in Sydney. Later that year, Goff returned and the family moved to Allora, Queensland. In part because Goff was often left alone as a child by parents who were &quot;caught up in their own importance&quot;, she developed a &quot;form of self-sufficiency and [...had an] idiosyncratic form of fantasy life&quot;, according to her biographer Valerie Lawson, often pretending to be a mother henat times for hours. Goff also wrote poetry, which her family paid little attention to. In 1906 Goff attended the Allora Public School. Travers Goff died at home in January 1907. Lyndon would struggle to come to terms with this fact for the next six years.
Following her father&#x27;s death, Goff, along with her mother and sisters, moved to Bowral, New South Wales, in 1907. In Bowral she attended the local branch of the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School as a day student. From 1912 Goff boarded at Normanhurst School in Ashfield, a suburb of Sydney. At Normanhurst, she began to love theatre. In 1914 she published an article in the &quot;Normanhurst School Magazine&quot;, her first, and later that year directed a school concert. The following year, Goff played the role of Bottom in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. She became a prefect and sought to have a successful career as an actress. Goff&#x27;s first employment was at the Australian Gas Light Company as a cashier. Between 1918 and 1924 she resided at 40 Pembroke Street, Ashfield. In 1920 Goff appeared in her first pantomime. The following year she was hired to work in a Shakespearean Company run by Allan Wilkie based in Sydney.

== Career ==
Goff had her first role in the troupe as Anne Page in a March 1921 performance of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. She decided to go by the stage name of &quot;Pamela Lyndon Travers&quot;, taking Travers from her father&#x27;s name and Pamela because she thought it a &quot;pretty&quot; name that &quot;flowed&quot; with Travers. Travers toured New South Wales beginning in early 1921 and returned to Wilkie&#x27;s troupe in Sydney by April 1922. That month, in a review of her performance as Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a critic for Frank Morton&#x27;s &quot;Triad&quot; wrote that her performance was &#x27;all too human&#x27;.

The troupe travelled to New Zealand, where Travers met and fell in love with a journalist for &quot;The Sun&quot;. The journalist took one of Travers&#x27; poems to his editor and it was published in the &quot;Sun.&quot; Even after she left New Zealand Travers continued to submit works to the &quot;Sun&quot;, eventually having her own column called &quot;Pamela Passes: the &quot;Sun&#x27;s&quot; Sydney Letter&quot;. Travers also had work accepted and published by publications including the &quot;Shakespeare Quarterly, Vision&quot;, and &quot;The Green Room&quot;. She was told to not make a career out of journalism and turned to poetry. &quot;The Triad&quot; published &quot;Mother Song&quot;, one of her poems, in March 1922, under the name &quot;Pamela Young Travers&quot;. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; published Travers&#x27; poem, &quot;Keening&quot;, on 20 March 1923, and she became a frequent contributor. In May 1923 she found employment at the &quot;Triad&quot;, where she was given the discretion to fill at least four pages of a women&#x27;s sectiontitled &quot;A Woman Hits Back&quot;every issue. Travers wrote poetry, journalism, and prose for her section; Lawson notes that &quot;erotic verse and coquetry&quot; figured prominently. She published a book of poetry, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;.

=== In England ===
On 9 February 1924, Travers left Australia for England, settling in London. She only revisited Australia once, in the 1960s. For four years she wrote poetry for the &quot;Irish Statesman&quot;, beginning while in Ireland in 1925 when Travers met the poet George William Russell (who wrote under the name &quot;Æ&quot;) who, as editor of the &quot;Statesman&quot;, accepted some of her poems for publication. Through Russell, whose kindness towards younger writers was legendary, Travers met W. B. Yeats, Oliver St. John Gogarty and other Irish poets who fostered her interest in and knowledge of world mythology.

After visiting Fontainebleau in France, Travers met George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, an occultist, of whom she became a &quot;disciple&quot;. Around the same time she was taught by Carl Gustav Jung in Switzerland. In 1931, she moved with her friend Madge Burnand from their rented flat in London to a thatched cottage in Sussex. There, in the winter of 1933, she began to write &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. During the 1930s, Travers reviewed drama for &quot;The New English Weekly&quot; and published the book &quot;Moscow Excursion&quot; (1934). &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was published that year with great success. Many sequels followed.

During the Second World War, Travers worked for the British Ministry of Information, spending five years in the US, publishing &quot;I Go by Sea, I Go by Land&quot; in 1941. At the invitation of her friend John Collier, the US Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Travers spent two summers living among the Navajo, Hopi and Pueblo peoples, studying their mythology and folklore. Travers moved back to England at the end of the war, where she continued writing. She moved into 50 Smith Street, Chelsea, London, which is commemorated with an English Heritage blue plaque. She returned to the US in 1965 and became writer-in-residence at Radcliffe College from 1965 to 1966 and at Smith College in 1966 and lecturing at Scripps College in 1970. She published various works and edited &quot;&quot; from 1976 to her death.

== &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; ==
As early as 1926, Travers published a short story, &quot;Mary Poppins and the Match Man&quot;, which introduced the nanny character of Mary Poppins and Bert the street artist. Published in London in 1934, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, the children&#x27;s book, was Travers&#x27; first literary success. Seven sequels followed, the last in 1988, when Travers was 89.

While appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in May 1977, Travers revealed that the name &quot;M. Poppins&quot; originated from childhood stories that she contrived for her sisters, and that she was still in possession of a book from that era with this name inscribed within. Travers&#x27;s great aunt, Helen Morehead, who lived in Woollahra, Sydney, and used to say &quot;Spit spot, into bed,&quot; is a likely inspiration for the character.

=== Disney version ===

The musical film adaptation &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was released by Walt Disney Pictures in 1964. Primarily based on the original 1934 novel of the same name, it also lifted elements from the 1935 sequel &quot;Mary Poppins Comes Back&quot;. The novels were loved by Disney&#x27;s daughters when they were children, and Disney spent 20 years trying to purchase the film rights to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, which included visits to Travers at her home in London. In 1961, Travers arrived in Los Angeles on a flight from London, her first-class ticket having been paid for by Disney, and finally agreed to sell the rights, in no small part because she was financially in dire straits. Travers was an adviser in the production, but she disapproved of the Poppins character in its Disney version; with harsher aspects diluted, she felt ambivalent about the music and she so hated the use of animation that she ruled out any further adaptations of the series. She received no invitation to the film&#x27;s star-studded première until she &quot;embarrassed a Disney executive into extending one&quot;. At the after-party, she said loudly, &quot;Well. The first thing that has to go is the animation sequence.&quot; Disney replied, &quot;Pamela, the ship has sailed&quot;.

Travers so disliked the Disney adaptation and the way she felt she had been treated during the production that when producer Cameron Mackintosh approached her years later about making the British stage musical, she acquiesced only on conditions that British writers alone and no one from the original film production were to be directly involved. That specifically excluded the Sherman Brothers from writing additional songs for the production. However, original songs and other aspects from the 1964 film were allowed to be incorporated into the production. Those points were even stipulated in her last will and testament.

In the 1977 interview on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Travers remarked about the film, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it once or twice, and I&#x27;ve learned to live with it. It&#x27;s glamorous and it&#x27;s a good film on its own level, but I don&#x27;t think it is very like my books.&quot;

=== Later films ===
The 2013 film &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; is a dramatised retelling of both the working process during the planning of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and of Travers&#x27;s early life, drawing parallels with &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and that of the author&#x27;s childhood. The film stars Emma Thompson as and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Thompson considered it the most challenging of her career because she had &quot;never really played anyone quite so contradictory or difficult before&quot;, but found the complicated character &quot;a blissful joy to embody&quot;.

In 2018, 54 years after the release of the original Mary Poppins film, a sequel was released titled &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, with Emily Blunt starring as Mary Poppins. The film, in which Mary Poppins returns to help Jane and Michael one year after a family tragedy, is set 25 years after the events of the first film.

== Personal life ==
Travers was reluctant to share details about her personal life, saying she &quot;most identified with Anonymous as a writer&quot; and asked whether &quot;biographies are of any use at all&quot;. Patricia Demers was allowed to interview her in 1988 but not to ask about her personal life.
Travers never married. Though she had numerous fleeting relationships with men throughout her life, she lived for more than a decade with Madge Burnand. They shared a London flat from 1927 to 1934, then moved to Pound Cottage near Mayfield, East Sussex, where Travers published the first of the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; books. Their relationship, in the words of one biographer, was &quot;intense&quot;, but equally ambiguous.

At the age of 40, two years after moving out on her own, Travers adopted a baby boy from Ireland whom she named Camillus Travers. He was the grandchild of Joseph Hone, the first biographer of George Moore and W. B. Yeats, who was raising his seven grandchildren with his wife. Camillus was unaware of his true parentage or the existence of any siblings until the age of 17, when Anthony Hone, his twin brother, came to London and knocked on the door of Travers&#x27;s house at 50 Smith Street, Chelsea. He had been drinking and demanded to see his brother. Travers refused and threatened to call the police. Anthony left but, soon after, following an argument with Travers, Camillus went looking for his brother and found him in a pub on King&#x27;s Road. Anthony had been fostered and raised by the family of the essayist Hubert Butler in Ireland. Through Camillus, Travers had three grandchildren.

Travers was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours. The investiture ceremony took place later that year at Buckingham Palace, with the Duke of Kent standing in for Queen Elizabeth II. She died in London on 23 April 1996 at the age of 96. She is buried at St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Twickenham, London. Although Travers never fully accepted the way the Disney film version of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; had portrayed her nanny figure, the film did make her rich. Her estate was valued for probate in September 1996 at £2,044,708.

== The Story Bank ==
Travers&#x27; birthplace and childhood home in Maryborough is now a museum dedicated to her legacy, called The Story Bank. There is also an annual Mary Poppins festival in Maryborough, celebrating the city&#x27;s connection to Travers.

== Travers crater ==
In 2018, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in her honour.

<text>John Muir ( ; April 21, 1838December 24, 1914), also known as &quot;John of the Mountains&quot; and &quot;Father of the National Parks&quot;, was a Scottish-born American naturalist, author, environmental philosopher, botanist, zoologist, glaciologist, and early advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States.

His books, letters and essays describing his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada, have been read by millions. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley and Sequoia National Park, and his example has served as an inspiration for the preservation of many other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he co-founded, is a prominent American conservation organization. In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to his wife and the preservation of the Western forests. As part of the campaign to make Yosemite a national park, Muir published two landmark articles on wilderness preservation in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Treasures of the Yosemite&quot; and &quot;Features of the Proposed Yosemite National Park&quot;; this helped support the push for US Congress to pass a bill in 1890 establishing Yosemite National Park. The spiritual quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings has inspired readers, including presidents and congressmen, to take action to help preserve large nature areas.

John Muir has been considered &quot;an inspiration to both Scots and Americans&quot;. Muir&#x27;s biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes that Muir has become &quot;one of the patron saints of twentieth-century American environmental activity&quot;, both political and recreational. As a result, his writings are commonly discussed in books and journals, and he has often been quoted by nature photographers such as Ansel Adams. &quot;Muir has profoundly shaped the very categories through which Americans understand and envision their relationships with the natural world&quot;, writes Holmes.

Muir was noted for being an ecological thinker, political spokesman, and environmental advocate, whose writings became a personal guide into nature for many people, making his name &quot;almost ubiquitous&quot; in the modern environmental consciousness. According to author William Anderson, Muir exemplified &quot;the archetype of our oneness with the earth&quot;, while biographer Donald Worster says he believed his mission was &quot;saving the American soul from total surrender to materialism&quot;. On April 21, 2013, the first John Muir Day was celebrated in Scotland, which marked the 175th anniversary of his birth, paying homage to the conservationist.

==Early life==

===Boyhood in Scotland===
John Muir was born in Dunbar, Scotland, in a three-story stone building now preserved as a museum. He was the third of eight children of Daniel Muir and Ann Gilrye; their other children were Margaret, Sarah, David, Daniel, Ann and Mary (twins), and the American-born Joanna. His earliest recollections were of taking short walks with his grandfather when he was three. In his autobiography, he described his boyhood pursuits, which included fighting, either by re-enacting romantic battles from the Wars of Scottish Independence or just wrestling on the playground, and hunting for birds&#x27; nests (ostensibly to one-up his fellows as they compared notes on who knew where the most were located). Author Amy Marquis notes that he began his &quot;love affair&quot; with nature while young, and implies that it may have been in reaction to his strict religious upbringing. &quot;His father believed that anything that distracted from Bible studies was frivolous and punishable.&quot; But the young Muir was a &quot;restless spirit&quot; and especially &quot;prone to lashings&quot;. As a young boy, Muir became fascinated with the East Lothian landscape, and spent a lot of time wandering the local coastline and countryside. It was during this time that he became interested in natural history and the works of Scottish naturalist Alexander Wilson.

Although he spent the majority of his life in America, Muir never forgot his roots in Scotland. He held a strong connection with his birthplace and Scottish identity throughout his life and was frequently heard talking about his childhood spent amid the East Lothian countryside. He greatly admired the works of Thomas Carlyle and poetry of Robert Burns; he was known to carry a collection of poems by Burns during his travels through the American wilderness. He returned to Scotland on a trip in 1893, where he met one of his Dunbar schoolmates and visited the places of his youth that were etched in his memory. He never lost his Scottish accent since he was already 11 years old when he and his family emigrated to America.

===Immigration to America===

In 1849, Muir&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States, starting a farm near Portage, Wisconsin, called Fountain Lake Farm. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark. Stephen Fox recounts that Muir&#x27;s father found the Church of Scotland insufficiently strict in faith and practice, leading to their immigration and joining a congregation of the Campbellite Restoration Movement, called the Disciples of Christ. By the age of 11, the young Muir had learned to recite &quot;by heart and by sore flesh&quot; all of the New Testament and most of the Old Testament. In maturity, while remaining a deeply spiritual man, Muir may have changed his orthodox beliefs. He wrote, &quot;I never tried to abandon creeds or code of civilization; they went away of their own accord ... without leaving any consciousness of loss.&quot; Elsewhere in his writings, he described the conventional image of a Creator &quot;as purely a manufactured article as any puppet of a half-penny theater&quot;.
When he was 22 years old, Muir enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, paying his own way for several years. There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson. A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree and used it to explain how the grand locust is a member of the pea family, related to the straggling pea plant. Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography. &quot;This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm&quot;. As a freshman, Muir studied chemistry with Professor Ezra Carr and his wife Jeanne; they became lifelong friends and Muir developed a lasting interest in chemistry and the sciences. Muir took an eclectic approach to his studies, attending classes for two years but never being listed higher than a first-year student due to his unusual selection of courses. Records showed his class status as &quot;irregular gent&quot; and, even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.

In 1863, his brother Daniel left Wisconsin and moved to Southern Ontario (then known as &quot;Canada West&quot; in the United Canadas), to avoid the draft during the US Civil War. Muir left school and travelled to the same region in 1864, and spent the spring, summer, and fall exploring the woods and swamps, and collecting plants around the southern reaches of Lake Huron&#x27;s Georgian Bay. Muir hiked along the Niagara Escarpment, including much of today&#x27;s Bruce Trail. With his money running low and winter coming, he reunited with his brother Daniel near Meaford, Ontario, who persuaded him to work with him at the sawmill and rake factory of William Trout and Charles Jay. Muir lived with the Trout family in an area called Trout Hollow, south of Meaford, on the Bighead River. While there, he continued &quot;botanizing&quot;, exploring the escarpment and bogs, collecting and cataloging plants. One source appears to indicate he worked at the mill/factory until the summer of 1865, while another says he stayed on at Trout Hollow until after a fire burned it down in February 1866.

In March 1866, Muir returned to the United States, settling in Indianapolis to work in a wagon wheel factory. He proved valuable to his employers because of his inventiveness in improving the machines and processes; he was promoted to supervisor, being paid $25 per week. In early-March 1867, an accident changed the course of his life: a tool he was using slipped and struck him in the eye. The file slipped and cut the cornea in his right eye and then his left eye sympathetically failed. He was confined to a darkened room for six weeks to regain his sight, worried about whether he would end up blind. When he regained his sight, &quot;he saw the world—and his purpose—in a new light&quot;. Muir later wrote, &quot;This affliction has driven me to the sweet fields. God has to nearly kill us sometimes, to teach us lessons&quot;. From that point on, he determined to &quot;be true to [himself]&quot; and follow his dream of exploration and study of plants.
In September 1867, Muir undertook a walk of about from Kentucky to Florida, which he recounted in his book &quot;A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf&quot;. He had no specific route chosen, except to go by the &quot;wildest, leafiest, and least trodden way I could find&quot;. When Muir arrived at Cedar Key, he began working for Richard Hodgson at Hodgson&#x27;s sawmill. However, three days after accepting the job at Hodgson&#x27;s, Muir almost died of a malarial sickness. After spending three months in an oft delirious state, Muir&#x27;s condition improved such that he was able to move about the Hodgson&#x27;s house and look outside. Due to their unending kindness in caring for his life, Muir stated that he &quot;doubtless owe my life&quot; to the Hodgsons.

One evening in early January 1868, Muir climbed onto the Hodgson house roof to watch the sunset. He saw a ship, the Island Belle, and learned it would soon be sailing for Cuba. Muir boarded the ship, and while in Havana, he spent his hours studying shells and flowers and visiting the botanical garden in the city. Afterwards, he sailed to New York City and booked passage to California. In 1878, Muir served as a guide and artist for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on the survey of the 39th parallel across the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah.

==== Experiencing Yosemite ====
Finally settling in San Francisco, Muir immediately left for a week-long visit to Yosemite, a place he had only read about. Seeing it for the first time, Muir notes that &quot;He was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower.&quot; He later returned to Yosemite and worked as a shepherd for a season. He climbed a number of mountains, including Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana, and hiked an old trail down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake.

Muir built a small cabin along Yosemite Creek, designing it so that a section of the stream flowed through a corner of the room so he could enjoy the sound of running water. He lived in the cabin for two years and wrote about this period in his book &quot;First Summer in the Sierra&quot; (1911). Muir&#x27;s biographer, Frederick Turner, notes Muir&#x27;s journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that his description &quot;blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience&quot;.

==== Friendships ====
During these years in Yosemite, Muir was unmarried, often unemployed, with no prospects for a career, and had &quot;periods of anguish&quot;, writes naturalist author John Tallmadge. In 1880 he married Louisa Strentzel. He went into business for 10 years with his father-in-law managing the orchards on the family 2600 acre farm in Martinez, California. John and Louisa had two daughters, Wanda Muir Hanna and Helen Muir Funk. He was sustained by the natural environment and by reading the essays of naturalist author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote about the very life that Muir was then living. On excursions into the back country of Yosemite, he traveled alone, carrying &quot;only a tin cup, a handful of tea, a loaf of bread, and a copy of Emerson.&quot; He usually spent his evenings sitting by a campfire in his overcoat, reading Emerson under the stars. As the years passed, he became a &quot;fixture in the valley&quot;, respected for his knowledge of natural history, his skill as a guide, and his vivid storytelling. Visitors to the valley often included scientists, artists, and celebrities, many of whom made a point of meeting with Muir.

During his time at the University of Wisconsin, Muir took classes under Charles H. Allen, with whom he became lifelong friends, sharing a love of natural sciences. Allen would move to California in 1872 and become the principal of the California State Normal School (now San Jose State University), Muir gave several lectures at the normal school, and Allen joined Muir in several mountain hikes.

Muir maintained a close friendship for 38 years with William Keith, a California landscape painter. They were both born the same year in Scotland and shared a love for the mountains of California.

In 1871, after Muir had lived in Yosemite for three years, Emerson, with several friends and family, arrived in Yosemite during a tour of the Western United States. The two men met, and according to Tallmadge, &quot;Emerson was delighted to find at the end of his career the prophet-naturalist he had called for so long ago ... And for Muir, Emerson&#x27;s visit came like a laying on of hands.&quot; Emerson spent one day with Muir, and he offered him a teaching position at Harvard, which Muir declined. Muir later wrote, &quot;I never for a moment thought of giving up God&#x27;s big show for a mere profship!&quot;

Muir also spent time with photographer Carleton Watkins and studied his photographs of Yosemite.

==== Geological studies and theories ====

Pursuit of his love of science, especially geology, often occupied his free time. Muir soon became convinced that glaciers had sculpted many of the features of the Yosemite Valley and surrounding area. This notion was in strong contradiction to the accepted contemporary theory, promulgated by Josiah Whitney (head of the California Geological Survey), which attributed the formation of the valley to a catastrophic earthquake. As Muir&#x27;s ideas spread, Whitney tried to discredit Muir by branding him as an amateur. But Louis Agassiz, the premier geologist of the day, saw merit in Muir&#x27;s ideas and lauded him as &quot;the first man I have ever found who has any adequate conception of glacial action&quot;.
In 1871, Muir discovered an active alpine glacier below Merced Peak, which helped his theories gain acceptance.

A large earthquake centered near Lone Pine in Owens Valley strongly shook occupants of Yosemite Valley in March 1872. The quake woke Muir in the early morning, and he ran out of his cabin &quot;both glad and frightened&quot;, exclaiming, &quot;A noble earthquake!&quot; Other valley settlers, who believed Whitney&#x27;s ideas, feared that the quake was a prelude to a cataclysmic deepening of the valley. Muir had no such fear and promptly made a moonlit survey of new talus piles created by earthquake-triggered rockslides. This event led more people to believe in Muir&#x27;s ideas about the formation of the valley.

==== Botanical studies ====
In addition to his geologic studies, Muir also investigated the plant life of the Yosemite area. In 1873 and 1874, he made field studies along the western flank of the Sierra on the distribution and ecology of isolated groves of Giant Sequoia. In 1876, the American Association for the Advancement of Science published Muir&#x27;s paper on the subject.

===Pacific Northwest===
Between 1879 and 1899, Muir made seven trips to Alaska, as far as Unalaska and Barrow. Muir, Mr. Young (Fort Wrangell missionary) and a group of Native American Guides first traveled to Alaska in 1879 and were the first Euro-Americans to explore Glacier Bay. Muir Glacier was later named after him. He traveled into British Columbia a third of the way up the Stikine River, likening its Grand Canyon to &quot;a Yosemite that was a hundred miles long&quot;. Muir recorded over 300 glaciers along the river&#x27;s course.

He returned for further explorations in southeast Alaska in 1880 and in 1881 was with the party that landed on Wrangel Island on the USS &quot;Corwin&quot; and claimed that island for the United States. He documented this experience in journal entries and newspaper articles—later compiled and edited into his book &quot;The Cruise of the Corwin&quot;. In 1888 after seven years of managing the Strentzel fruit ranch in Alhambra Valley, California, his health began to suffer. He returned to the hills to recover, climbing Mount Rainier in Washington and writing &quot;Ascent of Mount Rainier&quot;.

==Activism==

===Preservation efforts===
====Establishing Yosemite National Park====
Muir threw himself into the preservationist role with great vigor. He envisioned the Yosemite area and the Sierra as pristine lands. He thought the greatest threat to the Yosemite area and the Sierra was domesticated livestock—especially domestic sheep, which he referred to as &quot;hoofed locusts&quot;. In June 1889, the influential associate editor of &quot;The Century&quot; magazine, Robert Underwood Johnson, camped with Muir in Tuolumne Meadows and saw firsthand the damage a large flock of sheep had done to the grassland. Johnson agreed to publish any article Muir wrote on the subject of excluding livestock from the Sierra high country. He also agreed to use his influence to introduce a bill to Congress to make the Yosemite area into a national park, modeled after Yellowstone National Park.

On September 30, 1890, the US Congress passed a bill that essentially followed recommendations that Muir had suggested in two &quot;Century&quot; articles, &quot;The Treasures of the Yosemite&quot; and &quot;Features of the Proposed National Park&quot;, both published in 1890. But to Muir&#x27;s dismay, the bill left Yosemite Valley under state control, as it had been since the 1860s.

===Co-founding the Sierra Club===
In early 1892, Professor Henry Senger, a philologist at the University of California, Berkeley, contacted Muir with the idea of forming a local &#x27;alpine club&#x27; for mountain lovers. Senger and San Francisco attorney Warren Olney sent out invitations &quot;for the purpose of forming a &#x27;Sierra Club&#x27;. Mr. John Muir will preside&quot;. On May 28, 1892, the first meeting of the Sierra Club was held to write articles of incorporation. One week later Muir was elected president, Warren Olney was elected vice-president, and a board of directors was chosen that included David Starr Jordan, president of the new Stanford University. Muir remained president until his death 22 years later.

The Sierra Club immediately opposed efforts to reduce Yosemite National Park by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings. At one meeting in the fall of 1895 that included Muir, Joseph LeConte, and William R. Dudley, the Sierra Club discussed the idea of establishing &#x27;national forest reservations&#x27;, which were later called National Forests. The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906. The fight to preserve Hetch Hetchy Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight. Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to Hetch Hetchy Dam.

===Preservation vs conservation===
In July 1896, Muir became associated with Gifford Pinchot, a national leader in the conservation movement. Pinchot was the first head of the United States Forest Service and a leading spokesman for the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of the people. His views eventually clashed with Muir&#x27;s and highlighted two diverging views of the use of the country&#x27;s natural resources. Pinchot saw conservation as a means of managing the nation&#x27;s natural resources for long-term sustainable commercial use. As a professional forester, his view was that &quot;forestry is tree farming&quot;, without destroying the long-term viability of the forests. Muir valued nature for its spiritual and transcendental qualities. In one essay about the National Parks, he referred to them as &quot;places for rest, inspiration, and prayers.&quot; He often encouraged city dwellers to experience nature for its spiritual nourishment. Both men opposed reckless exploitation of natural resources, including clear-cutting of forests. Even Muir acknowledged the need for timber and the forests to provide it, but Pinchot&#x27;s view of wilderness management was more resource-oriented.

Their friendship ended late in the summer of 1897 when Pinchot released a statement to a Seattle newspaper supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves. Muir confronted Pinchot and demanded an explanation. When Pinchot reiterated his position, Muir told him: &quot;I don&#x27;t want any thing more to do with you&quot;. This philosophical divide soon expanded and split the conservation movement into two camps: the &quot;preservationists&quot;, led by Muir; and Pinchot&#x27;s camp, who used the term &quot;conservation&quot;. The two men debated their positions in popular magazines, such as &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Work&quot;, and &quot;Century&quot;. Their contrasting views were highlighted again when the United States was deciding whether to dam Hetch Hetchy Valley. Pinchot favored damming the valley as &quot;the highest possible use which could be made of it&quot;. In contrast, Muir proclaimed, &quot;Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for water-tanks the people&#x27;s cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the hearts of man&quot;.
In 1899, Muir accompanied railroad executive E. H. Harriman and esteemed scientists on the famous exploratory voyage along the Alaska coast aboard the luxuriously refitted steamer, the &quot;George W. Elder.&quot; He later relied on his friendship with Harriman to pressure Congress to pass conservation legislation.

In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt accompanied Muir on a visit to Yosemite. Muir joined Roosevelt in Oakland, California, for the train trip to Raymond. The presidential entourage then traveled by stagecoach into the park. While traveling to the park, Muir told the president about state mismanagement of the valley and rampant exploitation of the valley&#x27;s resources. Even before they entered the park, he was able to convince Roosevelt that the best way to protect the valley was through federal control and management.

After entering the park and seeing the magnificent splendor of the valley, the president asked Muir to show him the real Yosemite. Muir and Roosevelt set off largely by themselves and camped in the back country. The duo talked late into the night, slept in the brisk open air of Glacier Point, and were dusted by a fresh snowfall in the morning. It was a night Roosevelt never forgot. He later told a crowd, &quot;Lying out at night under those giant Sequoias was like lying in a temple built by no hand of man, a temple grander than any human architect could by any possibility build.&quot; Muir, too, cherished the camping trip. &quot;Camping with the President was a remarkable experience&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I fairly fell in love with him&quot;.

Muir then increased efforts by the Sierra Club to consolidate park management. In 1906 Congress transferred the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the park.

==Nature writer==

In his life, Muir published six volumes of writings, all describing explorations of natural settings. Four additional books were published posthumously. Several books were subsequently published that collected essays and articles from various sources. Miller writes that what was most important about his writings was not their quantity, but their &quot;quality&quot;. He notes that they have had a &quot;lasting effect on American culture in helping to create the desire and will to protect and preserve wild and natural environments&quot;.

His first appearance in print was by accident, writes Miller; a person he did not know submitted, without his permission or awareness, a personal letter to his friend Jeanne Carr, describing &quot;Calypso borealis&quot;, a rare flower he had encountered. The piece was published anonymously, identified as having been written by an &quot;inspired pilgrim&quot;. Throughout his many years as a nature writer, Muir frequently rewrote and expanded on earlier writings from his journals, as well as articles published in magazines. He often compiled and organized such earlier writings as collections of essays or included them as part of narrative books.

===Jeanne Carr: friend and mentor===
Muir&#x27;s friendship with Jeanne Carr had a lifelong influence on his career as a naturalist and writer. They first met in the fall of 1860, when, at age 22, he entered a number of his homemade inventions in the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society Fair. Carr, a fair assistant, was asked by fair officials to review Muir&#x27;s exhibits to see if they had merit. She thought they did and &quot;saw in his entries evidence of genius worthy of special recognition&quot;, notes Miller. As a result, Muir received a diploma and a monetary award for his handmade clocks and thermometer. During the next three years while a student at the University of Wisconsin, he was befriended by Carr and her husband, Ezra, a professor at the same university. According to Muir biographer Bonnie Johanna Gisel, the Carrs recognized his &quot;pure mind, unsophisticated nature, inherent curiosity, scholarly acumen, and independent thought&quot;. Jeanne Carr, 35 years of age, especially appreciated his youthful individuality, along with his acceptance of &quot;religious truths&quot; that were much like her own.
Muir was often invited to the Carrs&#x27; home; he shared Jeanne&#x27;s love of plants. In 1864, he left Wisconsin to begin exploring the Canadian wilderness and, while there, began corresponding with her about his activities. Carr wrote Muir in return and encouraged him in his explorations and writings, eventually having an important influence over his personal goals. At one point she asked Muir to read a book she felt would influence his thinking, Lamartine&#x27;s &quot;The Stonemason of Saint Point&quot;. It was the story of a man whose life she hoped would &quot;metabolize in Muir&quot;, writes Gisel, and &quot;was a projection of the life she envisioned for him&quot;. According to Gisel, the story was about a &quot;poor man with a pure heart&quot;, who found in nature &quot;divine lessons and saw all of God&#x27;s creatures interconnected&quot;.

After Muir returned to the United States, he spent the next four years exploring Yosemite, while at the same time writing articles for publication. During those years, Muir and Carr continued corresponding. She sent many of her friends to Yosemite to meet Muir and &quot;to hear him preach the gospel of the mountains&quot;, writes Gisel. The most notable was naturalist and author Ralph Waldo Emerson. The importance of Carr, who continually gave Muir reassurance and inspiration, &quot;cannot be overestimated&quot;, adds Gisel. It was &quot;through his letters to her that he developed a voice and purpose&quot;. She also tried to promote Muir&#x27;s writings by submitting his letters to a monthly magazine for publication. Muir came to trust Carr as his &quot;spiritual mother&quot;, and they remained friends for 30 years. In one letter she wrote to Muir while he was living in Yosemite, she tried to keep him from despairing as to his purpose in life.

The value of their friendship was first disclosed by a friend of Carr&#x27;s, clergyman and writer G. Wharton James. After obtaining copies of their private letters from Carr, and despite pleadings from Muir to return them, he instead published articles about their friendship, using those letters as a primary source. In one such article, his focus was Muir&#x27;s debt to Carr, stating that she was his &quot;guiding star&quot; who &quot;led him into the noble paths of life, and then kept him there&quot;.

===John Charles Van Dyke and Dix Strong Van Dyke===

John Charles Van Dyke was an author and Professor of Art at Rutgers College (now Rutgers, State University of New Jersey). His nephew Dix Strong Van Dyke had gone to Daggett, California to seek his fortune. Like his uncle, Dix was an author, who wrote &quot;Daggett: Life in a Mojave Frontier Town (Creating the North American Landscape)&quot;. John Muir found his way to Daggett and had many conversations with the uncle and nephew Van Dyke at the Dix ranch. This likely had an effect on his writings. His daughter Helen married Frank Buel and lived in Daggett.
===Writing becomes his work===
Muir&#x27;s friend, zoologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, writes that Muir&#x27;s style of writing did not come to him easily, but only with intense effort. &quot;Daily he rose at 4:30 o&#x27;clock, and after a simple cup of coffee labored incessantly. ... he groans over his labors, he writes and rewrites and interpolates&quot;. Osborn notes that he preferred using the simplest English language, and therefore admired above all the writings of Carlyle, Emerson and Thoreau. &quot;He is a very firm believer in Thoreau and starts by reading deeply of this author&quot;. His secretary, Marion Randall Parsons, also noted that &quot;composition was always slow and laborious for him. ... Each sentence, each phrase, each word, underwent his critical scrutiny, not once but twenty times before he was satisfied to let it stand&quot;. Muir often told her, &quot;This business of writing books is a long, tiresome, endless job&quot;.

Miller speculates that Muir recycled his earlier writings partly due to his &quot;dislike of the writing process&quot;. He adds that Muir &quot;did not enjoy the work, finding it difficult and tedious&quot;. He was generally unsatisfied with the finished result, finding prose &quot;a weak instrument for the reality he wished to convey&quot;. However, he was prodded by friends and his wife to keep writing and as a result of their influence he kept at it, although never satisfied. Muir wrote in 1872, &quot;No amount of word-making will ever make a single soul to &#x27;know&#x27; these mountains. One day&#x27;s exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books&quot;. In one of his essays, he gave an example of the deficiencies of writing versus experiencing nature.

==Philosophical beliefs==

===Nature and theology===

Muir believed that to discover truth, he must turn to what he believed were the most accurate sources. In his book, &quot;The Story of My Boyhood and Youth&quot; (1913), he writes that during his childhood, his father made him read the Bible every day. Muir eventually memorized three-quarters of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament. Muir&#x27;s father read Josephus&#x27;s &quot;War of the Jews&quot; to understand the culture of first-century Judea, as it was written by an eyewitness, and illuminated the culture during the period of the New Testament. But as Muir became attached to the American natural landscapes he explored, Williams notes that he began to see another &quot;primary source for understanding God: the Book of Nature&quot;. According to Williams, in nature, especially in the wilderness, Muir was able to study the plants and animals in an environment that he believed &quot;came straight from the hand of God, uncorrupted by civilization and domestication&quot;. As Tallmadge notes, Muir&#x27;s belief in this &quot;Book of Nature&quot; compelled him to tell the story of &quot;this creation in words any reader could understand&quot;. As a result, his writings were to become &quot;prophecy, for [they] sought to change our angle of vision&quot;.

Williams notes that Muir&#x27;s philosophy and world view rotated around his perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature. From this developed his core belief that &quot;wild is superior&quot;. His nature writings became a &quot;synthesis of natural theology&quot; with scripture that helped him understand the origins of the natural world. According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Dick suggested that the &quot;best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature&quot;. He came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world. As a result, Muir &quot;styled himself as a John the Baptist&quot;, adds Williams, &quot;whose duty was to immerse in &#x27;mountain baptism&#x27; everyone he could&quot;. Williams concludes that Muir saw nature as a great teacher, &quot;revealing the mind of God&quot;, and this belief became the central theme of his later journeys and the &quot;subtext&quot; of his nature writing.

During his career as writer and while living in the mountains, Muir continued to experience the &quot;presence of the divine in nature&quot;, writes Holmes. His personal letters also conveyed these feelings of ecstasy. Historian Catherine Albanese stated that in one of his letters, &quot;Muir&#x27;s eucharist made Thoreau&#x27;s feast on wood-chuck and huckleberry seem almost anemic&quot;. Muir was extremely fond of Thoreau and was probably influenced more by him than even Emerson. Muir often referred to himself as a &quot;disciple&quot; of Thoreau.

===Sensory perceptions and light===

During his first summer in the Sierra as a shepherd, Muir wrote field notes that emphasized the role that the senses play in human perceptions of the environment. According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, &quot;If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us ... we would never doubt that we were in another world ...&quot; While doing his studies of nature, he would try to remember everything he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal. As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.

However, Muir took his journal entries further than recording factual observations. Williams notes that the observations he recorded amounted to a description of &quot;the sublimity of Nature&quot;, and what amounted to &quot;an aesthetic and spiritual notebook&quot;. Muir felt that his task was more than just recording &quot;phenomena&quot;, but also to &quot;illuminate the spiritual implications of those phenomena&quot;, writes Williams. For Muir, mountain skies, for example, seemed painted with light, and came to &quot;... symbolize divinity&quot;. He often described his observations in terms of light.

Muir biographer Steven Holmes notes that Muir used words like &quot;glory&quot; and &quot;glorious&quot; to suggest that light was taking on a religious dimension: &quot;It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the notion of glory in Muir&#x27;s published writings, where no other single image carries more emotional or religious weight&quot;, adding that his words &quot;exactly parallels its Hebraic origins&quot;, in which biblical writings often indicate a divine presence with light, as in the burning bush or pillar of fire, and described as &quot;the glory of God&quot;.

===Seeing nature as home===
Muir often used the term &quot;home&quot; as a metaphor for both nature and his general attitude toward the &quot;natural world itself&quot;, notes Holmes. He often used domestic language to describe his scientific observations, as when he saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: &quot;the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety&quot;. Muir also saw nature as his own home, as when he wrote friends and described the Sierra as &quot;God&#x27;s mountain mansion&quot;. He considered not only the mountains as home, however, as he also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: &quot;The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we consider that we all have the same Father and Mother&quot;.

In his later years, he used the metaphor of nature as home in his writings to promote wilderness preservation.

Not surprisingly, Muir&#x27;s deep-seated feeling about nature as being his true home led to tension with his family at his home in Martinez, California. He once told a visitor to his ranch there, &quot;This is a good place to be housed in during stormy weather, ... to write in, and to raise children in, but it is not my home. Up there&quot;, pointing towards the Sierra Nevada, &quot;is my home&quot;.

===Native Americans===
Muir expressed mixed attitudes towards Native Americans over his life, from sympathy to distaste. He saw nature as ideal when it was free from man&#x27;s influence, including Native Americans, but he did not recognize that the landscapes he loved had been shaped by Native Americans for millennia, through the use of deliberately-set fires to burn-off understory growth. His earliest encounters, during his childhood in Wisconsin, were with Winnebago Indians, who begged for food and stole his favorite horse. In spite of that, he had expressed sympathy for their &quot;being robbed of their lands and pushed ruthlessly back into narrower and narrower limits by alien races who were cutting off their means of livelihood&quot;. His early encounters with the Paiute in California left him feeling ambivalent after seeing their lifestyle, which he described as &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;superstitious&quot;.

Muir wrote of the Miwoks in Yosemite as “most ugly, and some of them altogether hideous&quot; and that “they seemed to have no right place in the landscape, and I was glad to see them fading out of sight down the pass.” Ecofeminist philosopher Carolyn Merchant has criticized Muir, believing that he wrote disparagingly of the Native Americans he encountered in his early explorations. Later, after living with Indians, he praised and grew more respectful of their low impact on the wilderness, compared to the heavy impact by European Americans. However, in his journals, he often describes those he encounters as &quot;dirty,&quot; &quot;irregular&quot; and &quot;unnatural.&quot;

Muir was given the Stickeen (Muir&#x27;s spelling, coastal tribe) name &quot;Ancoutahan&quot;, meaning &quot;adopted chief&quot;.

In response to claims about Muir&#x27;s attitudes about Native Americans, Sierra Club national Board member Chad Hanson wrote, &quot;Muir wrote repeatedly about the intelligence and dignity of Native Americans, and honored how traditional Indigenous peoples lived in peaceful coexistence with Nature and wild creatures, expressing his view that Native peoples ‘rank above’ white settlers, who he increasingly described as selfish, base, and lacking honor. This would become a constant theme in Muir&#x27;s writings, as he attacked the dominant white culture&#x27;s destructive and greedy ways, and its anthrosupremacist mindset that placed humans above all else and recognized no intrinsic value in ecosystems or wildlife species beyond whatever profit could be gained by exploiting them.&quot;

===African Americans===
Muir spoke and wrote about the equality of all people, &quot;regardless of color, or race&quot;, and wrote about the immorality of slavery in his final book, &quot;Travels in Alaska&quot;. During his time in Alaska he also wrote...how we were all children of one father; sketched the characteristics of the different races of mankind, showing that no matter how far apart their countries were, how they differed in color, size, language, etc. and no matter how different and how various the ways in which they got a living, that the white man and all the people of the world were essentially alike, that we all had ten fingers and toes and our bodies were the same, whether white, brown, black or different colors, and speak different languages.

In his earlier years, Muir did make some disparaging remarks about African Americans. In &quot;A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf,&quot; Muir described African Americans as &quot;well trained&quot; but &quot;making a great deal of noise and doing little work. One energetic white man, working with a will, would easily pick as much cotton as half a dozen Sambos and Sallies.&quot; Describing the sight of two African Americans at a campfire, he wrote, &quot;I could see their ivory gleaming from the great lips, and their smooth cheeks flashing off light as if made of glass. Seen anywhere but in the South, the glossy pair would have been taken for twin devils, but here it was only a Negro and his wife at their supper.&quot; However, at no point in Muir&#x27;s personal journey to the Gulf did he support or empathize with the Southern cause, avoiding entreaties from Southern hosts when they prodded him.

In 2020, in light of the movement to remove Confederate monuments across the country, Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, reflected on Muir&#x27;s complex and controversial legacy and announced that the club would shift towards investing in racial justice work and determine which of its monuments need to be renamed or removed. On July 22, 2020, the Sierra Club wrote:Muir was not immune to the racism peddled by many in the early conservation movement. He made derogatory comments about Black people and Indigenous peoples that drew on deeply harmful racist stereotypes, though his views evolved later in his life. As the most iconic figure in Sierra Club history, Muir&#x27;s words and actions carry an especially heavy weight. They continue to hurt and alienate Indigenous people and people of color who come into contact with the Sierra Club.

Some of Muir&#x27;s associates cited by Brune and others, such as Joseph LeConte, David Starr Jordan, and Henry Fairfield Osborn were closely related to the early eugenics movement in the United States. Some claim Muir did not espouse such beliefs.

Aaron Mair, who in 2015 became the first Black president of the Sierra Club board, stated that the contents and framing of Muir in Brune&#x27;s post &quot;are a misrepresentation&quot;. Mair went on to state that Brune, &quot;did not consult him or the other two Black board members before pushing ahead on what he called a “revisionist” and “ahistorical” account of Muir&#x27;s writings, thoughts and life.&quot; Mair, along with two other Sierra Club board members, Chad Hanson and Mary Ann Nelson, wrote a response to Brune&#x27;s attack on Muir, writing:...while some of Muir’s colleagues promoted White supremacist myths and exclusionary views regarding national parks and forests, Muir spoke out about the importance of making these areas accessible and encouraging all people to experience them, writing, “Few are altogether deaf to the preaching of pine trees. Their sermons on the mountains go to our hearts; and if people in general could be got into the woods, even for once, to hear the trees speak for themselves, all difficulties in the way of forest preservation would vanish.” He came to believe deeply in the equality of all people, writing, “We all flow from one fountain Soul. All are expressions of one Love. God does not appear, and flow out, only from narrow chinks and round bored wells here and there in favored races and places.”

===Hetch Hetchy Dam controversy===

With population growth continuing in San Francisco, political pressure increased to dam the Tuolumne River for use as a water reservoir. Muir passionately opposed the damming of Hetch Hetchy Valley because he found Hetch Hetchy as stunning as Yosemite Valley. Muir, the Sierra Club and Robert Underwood Johnson fought against inundating the valley. Muir wrote to President Roosevelt pleading for him to scuttle the project. Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, William Howard Taft, suspended the Interior Department&#x27;s approval for the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way. After years of national debate, Taft&#x27;s successor Woodrow Wilson signed the bill authorizing the dam into law on December 19, 1913. Muir felt a great loss from the destruction of the valley, his last major battle. He wrote to his friend Vernon Kellogg, &quot;As to the loss of the Sierra Park Valley [Hetch Hetchy] it&#x27;s hard to bear. The destruction of the charming groves and gardens, the finest in all California, goes to my heart.&quot;

==Personal life==

In 1878, when he was nearing the age of 40, Muir&#x27;s friends &quot;pressured him to return to society&quot;. Soon after he returned to the Oakland area, he was introduced by Jeanne Carr to Louisa Strentzel, daughter of a prominent physician and horticulturist with a fruit orchard in Martinez, California, northeast of Oakland. In 1880, after he returned from a trip to Alaska, Muir and Strentzel married. John Muir went into partnership with his father-in-law John Strentzel, and for ten years directed most of his energy into managing this large fruit farm. Although Muir was a loyal, dedicated husband, and father of two daughters, &quot;his heart remained wild&quot;, writes Marquis. His wife understood his needs, and after seeing his restlessness at the ranch would sometimes &quot;shoo him back up&quot; to the mountains. He sometimes took his daughters with him.

The house and part of the ranch are now the John Muir National Historic Site. In addition, the W.H.C. Folsom House, where Muir worked as a printer, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Muir became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1903.

==Death==
Muir died, aged 76, at California Hospital in Los Angeles on December 24, 1914, of pneumonia. He had been in Daggett, California, to see his daughter, Helen Muir Funk. His grandson, Ross Hanna, lived until 2014, when he died at age 91.

==Legacy==

During his lifetime John Muir published over 300 articles and 12 books. He co-founded the Sierra Club, which helped establish a number of national parks after he died. Today the club has over 2.4 million members.

Muir has been called the &quot;patron saint of the American wilderness&quot; and its &quot;archetypal free spirit&quot;. &quot;As a dreamer and activist, his eloquent words changed the way Americans saw their mountains, forests, seashores, and deserts&quot;, said nature writer Gretel Ehrlich. He not only led the efforts to protect forest areas and have some designated as national parks, but his writings presented &quot;human culture and wild nature as one of humility and respect for all life&quot;.

Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, which published many of Muir&#x27;s articles, states that he influenced people&#x27;s appreciation of nature and national parks, which became a lasting legacy:

Muir exalted wild nature over human culture and civilization, believing that all life was sacred. Turner describes him as &quot;a man who in his singular way rediscovered America. ... an American pioneer, an American hero&quot;. The primary aim of Muir&#x27;s nature philosophy, writes Wilkins, was to challenge mankind&#x27;s &quot;enormous conceit&quot;, and in so doing, he moved beyond the Transcendentalism of Emerson to a &quot;biocentric perspective on the world&quot;. He did so by describing the natural world as &quot;a conductor of divinity&quot;, and his writings often made nature synonymous with God. His friend, Henry Fairfield Osborn, observed that as a result of his religious upbringing, Muir retained &quot;this belief, which is so strongly expressed in the Old Testament, that all the works of nature are directly the work of God&quot;. In the opinion of Enos Mills, a contemporary who established Rocky Mountain National Park, Muir&#x27;s writings were &quot;likely to be the most influential force in this century&quot;.

Since 1970, the University of the Pacific has housed the largest collection of Muir&#x27;s personal papers, including his travel journals and notebooks, manuscripts, correspondence, drawings and personal library. In 2019, the University of the Pacific was given full ownership of the Muir collection, which had been expanding over the years. The university has a John Muir Center for Environmental Studies, the Muir Experience, as well as other programs related to Muir and his work.

==Tributes and honors==

California celebrates John Muir Day on April 21 each year. Muir was the first person honored with a California commemorative day when legislation signed in 1988 created John Muir Day, effective from 1989 onward. Muir is one of three people so honored in California, along with Harvey Milk Day and Ronald Reagan Day.

&quot;Mountain Days&quot;, a 2000 musical by Craig Bohmler and Mary Bracken Phillips, celebrates Muir&#x27;s life and was performed annually in a custom-built amphitheater in Muir&#x27;s adult hometown of Martinez, California.

The play &quot;Thank God for John Muir&quot;, by Andrew Dallmeyer is based on his life.

Ceremonies at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin headquarters building included the unveiling of a John Muir commemorative stamp.
* Muir Valley – a privately owned nature preserve and rock climbing area in the Red River Gorge area of Kentucky. The Valley is approximately 400 acres in size and walled in by over seven miles of majestic cliffs of hard Corbin Sandstone. The owners, Rick &amp; Liz Weber, chose the name, &quot;Muir Valley&quot;, to honor the memory of John Muir.

John Muir was featured on two US commemorative postage stamps. A 5-cent stamp issued on April 29, 1964, was designed by Rudolph Wendelin, and showed Muir&#x27;s face superimposed on a grove of redwood trees, and the inscription, &quot;John Muir Conservationist&quot;. A 32-cent stamp issued on February 3, 1998, was part of the &quot;Celebrate the Century&quot; series, and showed Muir in Yosemite Valley, with the inscription &quot;John Muir, Preservationist&quot;. An image of Muir, with the California condor and Half Dome, appears on the California state quarter released in 2005. A quotation of his appears on the reverse side of the Indianapolis Prize Lilly Medal for conservation. On December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted John Muir into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.

The John Muir Trust is a Scottish charity established as a membership organization in 1983 to conserve wild land and wild places. It has more than 11,000 members internationally.

The John Muir Birthplace Charitable Trust is a Scottish charity whose aim is to support John Muir&#x27;s birthplace in Dunbar, which opened in 2003 as an interpretative centre focused on Muir&#x27;s work.

<doc id="215153" wikidata="Q152002" url="?curid=215153" title="Pastor">
<text>A pastor (abbreviated to &quot;Pr&quot; or &quot;Ptr&quot; (both singular), or &quot;Ps&quot; (plural)) is the leader of a Christian congregation who also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. In Lutheranism, Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy and Anglicanism, pastors are always ordained. In Methodism, pastors may be either licensed or ordained.

The New Testament typically uses the words &quot;bishops&quot; (Acts 20:28) and &quot;presbyter&quot; (1 Peter 5:1) to indicate the ordained leadership in early Christianity. Likewise, Peter instructs these particular servants to &quot;act like shepherds&quot; as they &quot;oversee&quot; the flock of God (1 Peter 5:2). The words &quot;bishop&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot; were sometimes used in an interchangeable way, such as in Titus 1:5-6. However, there is ongoing dispute between branches of Christianity over whether there are two ordained classes (presbyters and deacons), or three (bishops, priests, and deacons). The first view is affirmed by the Presbyterian Church. On the other hand, Christians of the Roman Catholic, Persian, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Moravian, Scandinavian Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic traditions maintain the latter view and affirm the doctrine of apostolic succession.

These terms describe a leader (e.g., bishop), one who maintains a careful watch for the spiritual needs of all the members of the flock (i.e., a pastor). The person must meet scriptural qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9). For some Protestants, whether called an elder, bishop, or pastor, these terms describe the same service in the church. In the early Church, only a man could be a presbyter , but many Protestant denominations in the 19th and 20th century have changed to allow women to be pastors, though others retained a male presbyterate. Whether man or woman, this person is to be older and experienced in the faith (i.e., an elder), a person who is a decision-maker, and a manager of church affairs.

The actual word &quot;pastor&quot; is derived from a Latin word meaning &quot;shepherd&quot;.

==History==
The word &quot;pastor&quot; derives from the Latin noun which means &quot;shepherd&quot; and is derived from the verb – &quot;to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat&quot;. The term &quot;pastor&quot; also relates to the role of elders within the New Testament, and is synonymous with the biblical understanding of the word &quot;minister&quot;. The term Pastor, Shepherd, and Elder are all the same position. The term &quot;Senior Pastor&quot; does not exist in scripture, but - in multi-staffed churches - is commonly used to denote the pastor who does the preaching. Many Protestant churches call their ministers &quot;pastors&quot;.

Present-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical metaphor of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (&quot;roʿeh&quot;), which is used as a noun as in &quot;shepherd&quot;, and as a verb as in &quot;to tend a flock.&quot; It occurs 173 times in 144 Old Testament verses and relates to the literal feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7. In Jeremiah 23:4, both meanings are used (&quot;ro&#x27;im&quot; is used for &quot;shepherds&quot; and &quot;yir&#x27;um&quot; for &quot;shall feed them&quot;), &quot;And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.&quot; (KJV).
English-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun (&quot;poimēn&quot;) as &quot;shepherd&quot; and the Greek verb (&quot;poimainō&quot;) as &quot;feed&quot;. The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; in John 10:11. The same words in the familiar Christmas story (Luke 2) refer to literal shepherds.

In five New Testament passages though, the words relate to members of the church:
# John 21:16 - Jesus told Peter: &quot;Feed My sheep&quot;
# Acts 20:17 - the Apostle Paul summons the &quot;elders&quot; of the church in Ephesus to give a last discourse to them; in Acts 20:28, he tells them that the Holy Spirit has made them &quot;overseers&quot;, and they are to &quot;feed&quot; the church of God.
# 1 Corinthians 9:7 - Paul says, of himself and the apostles: &quot;who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?&quot;
# Ephesians 4:11 - Paul wrote &quot;And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;&quot;
# 1 Peter 5:1-2 - Peter tells the &quot;elders&quot; among his readers that they are to, &quot;Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof&quot;

Bishops of various denominations often bear a formal crosier in the form of a stylised shepherd&#x27;s crook as a symbol of their pastoral/shepherding functions.

== Historical usage ==
Around 400 AD, Saint Augustine, a prominent African Catholic bishop, described a pastor&#x27;s job: Disturbers are to be rebuked, the low-spirited to be encouraged, the infirm to be supported, objectors confuted, the treacherous guarded against, the unskilled taught, the lazy aroused, the contentious restrained, the haughty repressed, litigants pacified, the poor relieved, the oppressed liberated, the good approved, the evil borne with, and all are to be loved.

== Current usage ==
=== Catholicism ===
In the United States and Canada, the term &quot;pastor&quot; is used by Catholics for what in other English-speaking countries is called a &quot;parish priest&quot;. The Latin term used in the Code of Canon Law is &quot;parochus&quot;.

=== Lutheranism ===
The Church of Sweden has a threefold ministry of bishop, priest, and deacon and those ordained to the presbyterate are referred to as priests. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, ordained presbyters are referred to by various publications, including Finnish ones, as pastors, or priests. In the United States, denominations like the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, use the terms reverend and pastor interchangeably for ordained members of the clergy, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), usually just uses pastor. On the other hand, the Lutheran Church - International, a Confessional Lutheran denomination of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship, uses the term &quot;priest&quot; for those ordained to the presbyterate, who are addressed as &quot;Father&quot;. 

=== Anglicanism ===
Ordained presbyters are called priests in the Church of England, as in all other ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Communion, and use the title the Reverend if they are Low church and Father or Mother if they are High church. Those leaders who are not ordained, but have a license from their Bishop, are increasingly using the title Pastor, as well as those office holders who are communicants within the Anglican Communion and participate in lay ministry where a license is not required.

=== Methodism ===
United Methodists ordain to the office of deacon and elder, each of whom can use the title of pastor depending. United Methodists also use the title of pastor for non-ordained clergy who are licensed and appointed to serve a congregation as their pastor or associate pastor, often referred to as licensed local pastors. These pastors may be lay people, seminary students, or seminary graduates in the ordination process, and cannot exercise any functions of clergy outside the charge where they are appointed.

=== Reformed ===
The use of the term &quot;pastor&quot; to refer to the common Protestant title of modern times dates to the days of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Both men, and other Reformers, seem to have revived the term to replace the Roman Catholic priest in the minds of their followers. The pastor was considered to have a role separate from the board of presbyters. A &quot;pastor&quot; may be either ordained or commissioned, depending on the methods used to appoint a person into the role, with either way resulting in the same authority and responsibilities to provide shepherding and grace to a congregation.

===Baptist===

The term &quot;pastor&quot;, in the majority of Baptist churches, is one of two offices within the church, deacon being the other, and is considered synonymous with &quot;elder&quot; or &quot;bishop&quot; (though in Reformed Baptist churches, elders are a separate office).

In larger churches with many staff members, &quot;Senior Pastor&quot; commonly refers to the person who gives the sermons the majority of the time, with other persons having titles relating to their duties, for example &quot;Worship Pastor&quot; for the person leading singing.

=== Restorationist ===
Some groups today view the &quot;pastor&quot;, &quot;bishop&quot;, and &quot;elder&quot; as synonymous terms or offices; many who do are descended from the Restoration Movement in America during the 19th century, such as the Disciples of Christ and the Churches of Christ.

==Other religions==
Other religions have started to use the term &quot;pastor&quot; for their own ordained leader of a congregation such as &quot;Buddhist pastor&quot;.

== Junior roles ==

An assistant or associate pastor is a person who assists the pastor in a Christian church. The qualifications, responsibilities and duties vary depending on church and denomination.

In many churches, an assistant pastor is a pastor-in-training, or are awaiting full ordination. In many instances, they are granted limited powers and authority to act with, or in the absence of, the &#x27;s pastor. Some churches that have outreach programs, such as hospital visitations, in-home programs, prison ministries, or multiple chapels, will appoint assistant pastors to perform duties while the Pastor is busy elsewhere. Some churches use the title &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;ordained brother&quot; in place of assistant pastor. In larger Roman Catholic parishes, the duties of an assistant pastor can be broken up into duties performed by deacons and non-ordained lay people.

<doc id="215155" wikidata="Q234992" url="?curid=215155" title="Lynne Cheney">
<text>Lynne Ann Cheney ( ; ; born August 14, 1941) is an American author, scholar, and former talk show host. She served as the second lady of the United States from 2001 to 2009 when her husband was vice president.

==Childhood and education==
Lynne Ann Vincent was born on August 14, 1941, in Casper, Wyoming. Her mother, Edna Lolita (&quot;née&quot; Lybyer, 1919–1973), became a deputy sheriff, and her father, Wayne Edwin Vincent, was an engineer. A descendant of Mormon pioneers, and with ancestral roots in Denmark, Sweden, England, Ireland, and Wales, she was raised Presbyterian and became Methodist upon her marriage to Dick Cheney.

Cheney received her Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature with highest honors from Colorado College. She continued her education with a Master of Arts degree from the University of Colorado Boulder, and a PhD in 19th-century British literature from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Her dissertation was entitled &quot;Matthew Arnold&#x27;s Possible Perfection: A Study of the Kantian Strain in Arnold&#x27;s Poetry&quot;.

==Early career==
Cheney served as the sixth chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1986 to 1993. In 1995, she founded the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a think tank devoted to reforming higher education.

She is a senior fellow in education and culture at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. She also serves as a director of Reader&#x27;s Digest Association, Inc. From 1995 to 1998, Cheney served as the co-host of the Sunday edition of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, replacing Tony Snow.

Cheney served on Lockheed Corporation&#x27;s board of directors from 1994 to 2001. She gave up the $120,000-a-year position shortly before her husband&#x27;s inauguration. She had served on the Lockheed board&#x27;s finance, and nominating and corporate governance committees.

In 2000, she was mentioned as a possible conservative female pick as Republican vice presidential nominee with George W. Bush. The appointed head of the nominating committee was her husband, Dick Cheney, then the CEO of Halliburton, who Bush eventually chose as his running mate.

==National history standards==
In the early 1990s when heading the NEH, Cheney advocated voluntary national history standards for the nation&#x27;s high school students and announced plans to create them. In 1994 shortly before the standards were to be released, Cheney, who was aghast at the results, wrote an opinion for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; she titled &quot;The End of History,&quot; where she &quot;set off a firestorm,&quot; according to Gary B. Nash who headed the standards effort. Cheney followed with another opinion, &quot;The End of History, Part II&quot; in 2015. As of the early 2020s, her reversal is still cited in the discussion and controversy surrounding The 1619 Project.

==Later career==
As second lady, she repeatedly spoke out against violent and sexually explicit lyrics in popular music, including those of rapper Eminem, picking up on an issue that was originally made famous by former vice president Al Gore and his wife Tipper. She also criticized video game developers for similar content.

On an October 10, 2007, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Cheney stated her opposition to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Her daughter Mary identifies as lesbian and both Lynne Cheney and her husband Dick have publicly supported same-sex marriage during and after his vice presidency.

==Family==
Lynne Cheney married Richard Cheney in 1964. They have two daughters and seven grandchildren. Their daughters are Elizabeth Cheney (born July 28, 1966), and Mary Cheney (born on March 14, 1969).

Lynne Cheney has one brother, Mark Vincent, who lives in Wyoming with his wife, Linda.

==Wyoming U.S. Senate seat vacancy==
Cheney was considered a possible contender to complete the term of Craig L. Thomas as U.S. senator from Wyoming following his death in 2007. A spokesman stated that she was considering the post but she never signed an application to become a candidate. Cheney herself acknowledged in a 2015 interview that she had considered running for the senate seat. If she had won the seat, she would have become the first former second lady to be a member of the Senate since Muriel Humphrey was appointed Senator from Minnesota after her husband&#x27;s death in 1978.

== In popular culture ==
Cheney criticized Eminem in September 2000 for his promotion of &quot;violence of the most degrading kind against women&quot;, in response to which he mockingly referenced Lynne and Dick Cheney (and his recurring heart problems) in the 2002 song &quot;Without Me&quot;. Cheney was portrayed by Amy Adams in the 2018 film &quot;Vice&quot;, a biopic about Dick Cheney. In this political satire, she is portrayed as a sly driving force and a source of inspiration and support behind her husband&#x27;s political career.

<doc id="215160" wikidata="Q14190168" url="?curid=215160" title="Josef Locke">
<text>Joseph McLaughlin (23 March 1917 – 15 October 1999), known professionally as Josef Locke, was an Irish tenor. He was successful in the United Kingdom and Ireland in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Background==
Born in Derry, Ireland, he was the son of a butcher and cattle dealer, and one of nine children. He started singing in local churches in the Bogside at the age of seven, and as a teenager added two years to his age to enlist in the Irish Guards, later serving abroad with the Palestine Police Force, before returning in the late 1930s to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

==Career==
Known as &quot;The Singing Bobby&quot;, he became a local celebrity before starting to work the UK variety circuit, where he also played summer seasons in English seaside resorts. The renowned Irish tenor John McCormack advised him that his voice was better suited to a lighter repertoire than the operatic one he had in mind, and urged him to find an agent—thus he found the noted impresario Jack Hylton who booked him, but could not fit his full name on the bill, thus &quot;Joseph McLaughlin&quot; became &quot;Josef Locke&quot;.

He made an immediate impact when featured in &quot;Starry Way,&quot; a twenty-week summer show at the Blackpool Opera House in 1946 and was rebooked for the following summer, then starring for three seasons at the Blackpool Hippodrome. He appeared in ten Blackpool seasons from 1946 to 1969, not the nineteen seasons he later claimed.

He made his first radio broadcast in 1949, and subsequently appeared on television programmes such as &quot;Rooftop Rendezvous&quot;, &quot;Top of the Town&quot;, &quot;All-star Bill&quot; and &quot;The Frankie Howerd Show&quot;. He was signed to the Columbia label in 1947, and his first releases were the two Italian songs &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; and &quot;Come Back to Sorrento&quot;.

===Success===
In 1947, Locke released &quot;Hear My Song, Violetta,&quot; which became forever associated with him. It was based on a 1936 tango &quot;Hör&#x27; mein Lied, Violetta&quot; by Othmar Klose and Rudolf Lukesch. The song &quot;Hör&#x27; mein Lied, Violetta&quot; was often covered, including by Peter Alexander and was itself based on Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot;.

Locke&#x27;s other songs were mostly a mixture of ballads associated with Ireland (&quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen&quot;, &quot;Dear Old Donegal&quot;, &quot;Galway Bay&quot;, &quot;The Isle of Innisfree&quot;, the theme song from the film &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, and another Dick Farrelly song, &quot;The Rose of Slievenamon&quot;) excerpts from operettas (including &quot;The Drinking Song&quot; from &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, &quot;My Heart and I&quot; from Richard Tauber&#x27;s operetta &quot;Old Chelsea&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye&quot; from &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot;) and familiar favourites such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Beside You,&quot; &quot;Come Back to Sorrento,&quot; and &quot;Cara Mia.&quot;

In 1948, he appeared in several films produced by Mancunian Films, usually as versions of himself. He plays himself in the film &quot;Holidays with Pay&quot;. He also appears as &quot;Sergeant Locke&quot; in the 1949 comedy &quot;What a Carry On!&quot;.

In 1958, after he had appeared in five Royal Variety Performances, and while he was still at the peak of his career, the British tax authorities began to make substantial demands that Locke declined to meet. Eventually he fled the country for Ireland, where he lay low for several years. When his differences with the taxman were eventually settled, Locke relaunched his career in England with tours of the northern variety clubs and summer seasons at Blackpool&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1968 and 1969, before retiring to County Kildare, emerging for the occasional concert in England. He later appeared on British and Irish television, and in November 1984 was given a lengthy 90-minute tribute in honour of the award he was to be receiving at the Olympia theatre commemorating his career in show business on Gay Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Locke also made many appearances on the BBC TV&#x27;s long running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

===&quot;Hear My Song&quot;===

In 1991, the Peter Chelsom film &quot;Hear My Song&quot; was released. It is a fantasy based on the notion of Locke returning from his Irish exile in the 1960s to complete an old love affair, and save a Liverpool-based Irish night-club from ruination. Locke is played by Ned Beatty, with the singing voice of Vernon Midgley.

The film led to a revival in Locke&#x27;s career. A compilation CD was released and he appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in March 1992. He performed in front of the Prince and Princess of Wales at the 1992 Royal Variety Show, singing &quot;Goodbye&quot;, the final song performed by his character in the film. He had announced before the song that this would be his final public appearance.

==Memorial==
Josef Locke died on 15 October 1999 aged 82, and was survived by his wife, Carmel, and a son.

On 22 March 2005, a bronze memorial to Locke was unveiled outside the City Hotel on Queen&#x27;s Quay in Derry by Phil Coulter and John Hume. The memorial was designed by Terry Quigley. It takes the form of a spiraling scroll divided by lines, representing a musical stave. The spiral suggests the flowing melody of a song, and is punctuated by images illustrating episodes in his life, including Locke in police uniform, Blackpool Tower, Carnegie Hall, and the musical notes of the opening lines of &quot;Hear My Song&quot;.

A biography of the singer, entitled &quot;Josef Locke: The People&#x27;s Tenor&quot;, by Nuala McAllister Hart was published in March 2017, the centenary of his birth. The book corrects many myths that the charismatic Locke circulated about his career.

<text>Thurles (; &quot;Durlas Éile&quot;) is a town in County Tipperary, Ireland. It is located in the civil parish of the same name in the barony of Eliogarty and in the ecclesiastical parish of Thurles. The cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly is located in the town.

The birthplace of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Thurles is the third largest town in the county, with a population of 8,185 at the 2022 census.

==Location and access==
Thurles is located in mid-County Tipperary and is surrounded by the Silvermine Mountains (to the northwest) and the Slieveardagh Hills (to the southeast). The town itself is built on a crossing of the River Suir.

The M8 motorway connects Thurles to Cork and Dublin via the N75 and N62 roads. The N62 also connects Thurles to the centre of Ireland (Athlone) via Templemore and Roscrea. The R498 road links Thurles to Nenagh. Thurles railway station opened on 13 March 1848 and has connections to Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Tralee.

==History==

===Ancient history===

The ancient territory of Éile obtained its name from pre-historic inhabitants called the Eli, about whom little is known beyond what may be gathered from legends and traditions. The extent of &quot;Éile&quot; varied throughout the centuries with the rise and fall of the tribes in occupation. Before the 5th century A.D. the details of its history which can be gleaned from surviving records and literature are exceedingly meagre, obscure and confusing. During this century however &quot;Éile&quot; appears to have reached its greatest extent, stretching from &quot;Croghan Bri Eli&quot; (Croghan Hill in Offaly) to just south of Cashel (in &quot;Corca Eathrach Eli&quot;). The southern part of this territory embraced the baronies of Eliogarty and Ikerrin, a great part of Middle Third, the territory of Ileagh and a portion of the barony of Kilnamanagh Upper.

By the 8th century, the territory of ancient &quot;Éile&quot; had broken up into a number of petty kingdoms: the O&#x27;Carroll occupied the northern portion, the O&#x27;Spillanes held Ileagh, the Eóganacht Chaisil had annexed Middle Third while the O&#x27;Fogartys held what is now the barony of Eliogarty. The O&#x27;Fogarty&#x27;s gave their name to the town. In Irish, &quot;Durlas Éile&quot; means &quot;Strong Fort of Éile&quot;, or more correctly &quot;Durlas Éile Uí Fhogartaigh&quot; (&quot;Strong Fort of the O&#x27;Fogarty&#x27;s of Éile&quot;). The clan dominated the regions of Templemore and the Devil&#x27;s Bit stretching as far as the Tipperary/Kilkenny border.

===Feudal period===

Towards the end of the 12th century the power of the O&#x27;Donoghue clan began to wane, and by the early part of the 13th century, the Norman Butler dynasty came to be the most powerful. It is to the Butlers that Thurles owes much of its early development. Their architectural legacy may be seen today with two of the original family fortresses still standing (the Black Castle near the centre and O&#x27;Fogarty Castle by the Suir). Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler (Theobald Butler) was the ancestor of the Irish branch of the Butler dynasty. His father had been the hereditary holder of the office of Chief Butler of England and when Theobald assisted Kings Henry II of England and John of England in their invasions of Ireland, he was named &quot;Chief Butler of Ireland&quot;. He was also granted a large section of the northeastern part of the kingdom of Limerick. Later in 1328, his descendant, James Butler, was created Earl of Ormond by King Edward III of England.


==Commerce==
Thurles was originally an agricultural market town. It is now a retail town, with chain stores like Dunnes Stores, Supervalu, Lidl, Aldi, Boots, and Holland and Barrett established in the town. The headquarters of the meat processing factory Dew Valley Foods is also located in the Thurles environs. Thurles Shopping centre was recently extended and plans to open a new a Tesco store to replace the current store in Liberty Square have also been announced. Stakelum&#x27;s Hardware, which recently moved to the Nenagh road, is one of the biggest family owned business in the town. McKevitt&#x27;s &quot;Costcutter&quot; is another large family business that operates with one supermarket in the town. High technology industries have been established in the Thurles Technology Park.

=== Jobs ===
Is the home of food company Erin gravy, sauce, soup and vegetable maker.

==Music and arts==

===The Source Arts Centre===
 The Source Arts Centre opened on 2 October 2006 and has become the biggest music, theatre and arts venue in north Tipperary. It consists of a 250-seat auditorium with fully flexible seating, and a dedicated gallery space. The year-round programme of events includes film, theatre, dance, ballet, opera, music, family events and visual art exhibitions. Acts like Aslan, Foster and Allen, The Fureys are among the list to have played there.

===Féile festival===
The Féile Festival, which ran from 1990 to 1997, was held in Semple Stadium. At the height of its success, an estimated 100,000 people attended the festival, which was also known as &quot;The Trip to Tipp&quot;. Acts that played included The Prodigy, The Cranberries, Blur, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison, Rage Against the Machine, The Beautiful South and Deacon Blue.

The festival was revived in 2019 with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor among others playing.

===Thurles Arts Festival===
Thurles Arts Festival started in 2009. Organised by local councillor Jim Ryan. It will return for a third time in 2011 with various events around the town in Pubs, Clubs and The Source arts centre.

==Amenities and features==

===Semple Stadium===
Thurles is the birthplace of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), founded in 1884 in Hayes&#x27; Hotel. Semple Stadium is the second largest GAA stadium in Ireland with a capacity of 53,500, second only to Croke Park in Dublin. The stadium is the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Munster hurling and many famous matches, especially Munster Finals, have been played there. In 1984, it hosted the All-Ireland Hurling Final to celebrate 100 years since the founding of the GAA in Thurles.

===Thurles Cathedral===

The Cathedral of the Assumption is the mother church of the ecclesiastical province of Cashel and the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. It is not in its original site of the Rock of Cashel. This is due to the assumption of certain ecclesiastical properties by the established Church of Ireland at the time of the English Reformation. Instead, following the relaxation of the Penal Laws, the Roman Catholic archbishop chose to locate his &quot;cathedra&quot; and residence in nearby Thurles. The present Cathedral of the Assumption stands on the site of earlier chapels in the centre of the town. Work on the cathedral, with its Romanesque architectural style and its facade modelled on that of Pisa, commenced in 1865. It was consecrated by Archbishop Thomas Croke on 21 June 1879. The architect was J.J. McCarthy while Barry McMullen was the main builder. Mr. J.C Ashlin was responsible for the enclosing walls, railing and much of the finished work. The cathedral&#x27;s main features include a rose window, a free-standing baptistery and a magnificent altar. Particularly noteworthy is the tabernacle, the work of Giacomo della Porta, who was a pupil of Michelangelo.

The cathedral was extensively renovated and the sanctuary sympathetically remodelled on the occasion of its centenary in 1979.

===Famine museum===
St. Mary&#x27;s church, belonging to the Church of Ireland, is built on the site of another pre-reformation church in Thurles. This structure was built by the Normans in the 12th century to provide them with a separate and more exclusive place of worship. The building is currently occupied and has a famine museum as well as a war museum. The Famine Museum is now closed.

===Library===
Thurles Library is located in the arts centre.

===Thurles Leisure Centre===
In 2003, the county council demolished the old swimming pool with plans to build a new pool which were later scrapped. In 2007, a new swimming pool and gym was opened.

==Sport==

===Gaelic games===

<text>V838 Monocerotis (Nova Monocerotis 2002) is a cataclysmic binary star in the constellation Monoceros about 19,000 light years (6 kpc) from the Sun. The previously unremarked star was observed in early 2002 experiencing a major outburst, and was one of the largest known stars for a short period following the outburst. Originally believed to be a typical nova eruption, it was then identified as the first of a new class of eruptive variables known as luminous red novae. The reason for the outburst is still uncertain, but is thought to have been a merger of two stars within a triple system.

The eruption occurred on one of two B3 main sequence stars in a close binary orbit. The erupting star appeared as an unusually cool supergiant and for a while engulfed its companion. By 2009 the temperature of the supergiant had increased (since 2005) to 3,270 K and its luminosity was 15,000 times solar (), but its radius had decreased to 380 times that of the Sun (), although the ejecta continues to expand.

==Outburst==
On January 6, 2002, an unknown star was seen to brighten in the constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn. Being a new variable star, it was designated V838 Monocerotis, the 838th variable star of Monoceros. The initial light curve resembled that of a nova, an eruption that occurs when enough hydrogen gas accumulates on the surface of a white dwarf from its close binary companion. Therefore, the object was also designated Nova Monocerotis 2002. V838 Monocerotis reached a maximum visual magnitude of 6.75 on February 6, 2002, after which it started to dim rapidly, as expected. However, in early March, the star started to brighten again, particularly in infrared wavelengths. Yet another brightening in infrared occurred in early April. In 2003, the star returned to near its original brightness before the eruption (magnitude 15.6), but as a red supergiant rather than a blue main-sequence star. The light curve produced by the eruption was unlike anything previously seen.
In 2009, the star was about , which, in the absence of extinction, would correspond to an apparent magnitude of 8.5.
The star brightened to about a million times solar luminosity and an absolute magnitude of −9.8, ensuring that at the time of maximum, it was one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Its brightening was caused by a rapid expansion of its outer layers.

V838 Monocerotis was observed by use of the Palomar Testbed Interferometer, which indicated a radius of (comparable to Jupiter&#x27;s orbital radius), confirming the earlier indirect calculations. At the currently accepted distance of 6,100 pc, the measured angular diameter in late 2004 (1.83 mas) corresponded to a radius of , but by 2014, it shrunk to , around 70 solar radii larger than Antares. The expansion took only a couple of months, meaning that its speed was abnormal. Because the laws of thermodynamics dictate that expanding gases cool, the star became extremely cool and deep red. In fact, some astronomers argue that the spectrum of the star initially resembled that of L-type brown dwarfs. If that is the case, V838 Monocerotis was the first known L-type supergiant. Since then, it has shrunk and heated up and is now considered an M-type supergiant. However, current estimates of the distance, and hence of the radius, are about 25% lower than assumed in those papers.

===Other possibly similar events===
There are a handful of outbursts resembling that of V838 Monocerotis. In 1988, a red star was detected erupting in the Andromeda Galaxy. The star, designated M31-RV, reached the absolute bolometric magnitude of −9.95 at maximum (corresponding to a luminosity of ) before dimming beyond detectability. A similar eruption, V4332 Sagittarii, occurred in 1994 in the Milky Way.

==Progenitor star==

Based on an incorrect interpretation of the light echo the eruption generated, the distance of the star was first estimated to be 1,900 to 2,900 light years. Combined with the apparent magnitude measured from pre-eruption photographs, it was thought to be an underluminous F-type dwarf, which posed a considerable enigma.

More accurate measurements gave a much larger distance, 20,000 light years (6 kpc). It appears that the star was considerably more massive and luminous than the Sun. The star probably has a mass of from 5 to 10 times the mass of the Sun (). It was apparently either a B1.5V star with a B3V companion, or an A0.5V with a B4V companion. In the latter case it would have had a luminosity around (being 0.43 times as luminous as its companion), and in the former case it would have been more luminous (about 1.9 times as luminous as its companion). The star may have originally had a radius roughly and its temperature would have been that of a B-type star (more than 10,000K but less than 30,000K). Munari et al. (2005) suggested that the progenitor star was a very massive supergiant with an initial mass of about , but this has been contested. There seems to be agreement that the star system is relatively young.
Munari et al. conclude that the system may be only about 4 million years old.

The spectrum of V838 Monocerotis reveals a companion, a hot blue B-type main sequence star probably not very different from the progenitor star. It is also possible that the progenitor was slightly less massive than the companion and only just entering the main sequence.

Based on the photometric parallax of the companion, Munari et al. calculated a greater distance, 36,000 light years (10 kpc).

==Light echo==

Rapidly brightening objects like novae and supernovae are known to produce a phenomenon known as light echo. The light that travels directly from the object arrives first. If there are clouds of interstellar matter around the star, some light is reflected from the clouds. Because of the longer path, the reflected light arrives later, producing a vision of expanding rings of light around the erupted object. The rings appear to travel faster than the speed of light, but in fact they do not.

In the case of V838 Monocerotis, the light echo produced was unprecedented and is well documented in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. While the photos appear to depict an expanding spherical shell of debris, they are actually formed by the illumination of an ever-expanding ellipsoid with the progenitor star at one focus and the observer at the other. Hence, despite appearances, the structures in these photos are actually concave toward the viewer.

By March 2003 the size of the light echo in the sky was twice the angular diameter of Jupiter and was continuing to grow. Jupiter&#x27;s angular diameter varies from 30 to 51 arcseconds.

It is not yet clear if the surrounding nebulosity is associated with the star itself. If that is the case, they may have been produced by the star in earlier eruptions which would rule out several models that are based on single catastrophic events. However, there is strong evidence that the V838 Monocerotis system is very young and still embedded in the nebula from which it formed.

The eruption initially emitted at shorter wavelengths (i.e. was bluer), which can be seen in the light echo: the outer border is bluish in the Hubble images.

==Hypotheses==

This and other luminous red nova events are thought to be caused by the merger of two stars. In the case of V838 Monocerotis, it was the merger of two main sequence stars, or an main sequence star and a pre-main sequence star. The merger model explains the multiple peaks in the light curve observed during the outburst. Based on further observations of stars similar to V838 Monocerotis, such as V1309 Scorpii, astronomers have reached the conclusion that this is the most likely scenario.

Other explanations for the eruption of V838 Monocerotis have also been published.

===Atypical nova outburst===
The outburst of V838 Monocerotis may be a nova eruption after all, albeit a very unusual one. However, this is very unlikely considering that the system includes a B-type star, and stars of this type are young and massive. There has not been enough time for a possible white dwarf to cool and accrete enough material to cause the eruption.

===Thermal pulse of a dying star===
V838 Monocerotis may be a post-asymptotic giant branch star, on the verge of going supernova. The nebulosity illuminated by the light echo may actually be shells of dust surrounding the star, created by the star during previous similar outbursts. The brightening may have been a so-called helium flash, where the core of a dying low-mass star suddenly ignites helium fusion disrupting, but not destroying, the star. Such an event is known to have occurred in Sakurai&#x27;s Object. However, several pieces of evidence support the argument that the dust is interstellar rather than centered on V838 Monocerotis. A dying star that has lost its outer envelopes would be appropriately hot, but the evidence points to a young star instead.

===Thermonuclear event within a massive supergiant===
According to some evidence, V838 Monocerotis may be a very massive supergiant. Also in this case, the outburst may have been a helium flash. Very massive stars survive multiple such events; however, they experience heavy mass loss (about half of the original mass is lost while in the main sequence) before settling as extremely hot Wolf-Rayet stars. This theory may also explain the apparent dust shells around the star. V838 Monocerotis is located in the approximate direction of the galactic anticenter and off from the disk of the Milky Way. Stellar birth is less active in outer galactic regions, and it is not clear how such a massive star can form there. However, there are very young clusters like Ruprecht 44 and the 4-million-year-old NGC 1893 at a distance of about 7 and 6 kiloparsecs, respectively.

===Planetary capture event===
Another possibility is that V838 Monocerotis may have swallowed its giant planets. If one of the planets entered into the atmosphere of the star, the stellar atmosphere would have begun slowing down the planet. As the planet penetrated deeper into the atmosphere, friction would become stronger and kinetic energy would be released into the star more rapidly. The star&#x27;s envelope would then warm up enough to trigger deuterium fusion, which would lead to rapid expansion. The later peaks may then have occurred when two other planets entered into the expanded envelope. The authors of this model calculate that every year about 0.4 planetary capture events occur in Sun-like stars in the Milky Way galaxy, whereas for massive stars like V838 Monocerotis the rate is approximately 0.5–2.5 events per year.

<doc id="215166" wikidata="Q620737" url="?curid=215166" title="Appeasement">
<text>Appeasement, in an international context, is a diplomatic negotiation policy of making political, material, or territorial concessions to an aggressive power with intention to avoid conflict. The term is most often applied to the foreign policy between 1935 and 1939 of the British governments of Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and most notably Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Under British pressure, appeasement of Nazism and Fascism also played a role in French foreign policy of the period but was always much less popular there than in the United Kingdom.

In the early 1930s, appeasing concessions were widely seen as desirable because of the anti-war reaction to the trauma of World War I (1914–1918), second thoughts about the perceived vindictive treatment by some of Germany during the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, and a perception that fascism was a useful form of anti-communism. However, by the time of the Munich Agreement, which was concluded on 30 September 1938 between Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, the policy was opposed by the Labour Party and by a few Conservative dissenters such as future Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper, and future Prime Minister Anthony Eden. Appeasement was strongly supported by the British upper class, including royalty, big business (based in the City of London), the House of Lords, and media such as the BBC and &quot;The Times.&quot;

As alarm grew about the rise of fascism in Europe, Chamberlain resorted to attempts at news censorship to control public opinion. He confidently announced after Munich that he had secured &quot;peace for our time&quot;.

Academics, politicians and diplomats have intensely debated the 1930s appeasement policies ever since they occurred. Historians&#x27; assessments have ranged from condemnation (&quot;Lesson of Munich&quot;) for allowing Hitler&#x27;s Germany to grow too strong to the judgment that Germany was so strong that it might well win a war and that postponing a showdown was in the best interests of the West.

==History==
===Failure of collective security===
Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement emerged from the failure of the League of Nations and the failure of collective security. The League of Nations was set up in the aftermath of World War I in the hope that international co-operation and collective resistance to aggression might prevent another war. Members of the League were entitled to the assistance of other members if they came under attack. The policy of collective security ran in parallel with measures to achieve international disarmament and, if possible, was to be based on economic sanctions against an aggressor. The policy appeared to be ineffectual when confronted by the aggression of dictators, notably Germany&#x27;s Remilitarisation of the Rhineland and Italy&#x27;s Benito Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia.

====Invasion of Manchuria====

In September 1931, the Empire of Japan, a member of the League of Nations, invaded Manchuria, in northeast China, by claiming that the regional population was not only Chinese but was multi-ethnic. The Republic of China appealed to the League of Nations and to the United States for assistance. The League of Nations Council asked the parties to withdraw to their original positions to permit a peaceful settlement. The United States reminded them of their duty under the Kellogg–Briand Pact to settle matters peacefully. Japan was undeterred and went on to occupy the whole of Manchuria. The League set up a commission of inquiry that condemned Japan, and the League duly adopted the report in February 1933. In response, Japan resigned from the League and continued its advance into China, with neither the League nor the United States taking any action. However, the U.S. issued the Stimson Doctrine and refused to recognize Japan&#x27;s conquest, which played a role in shifting U.S. policy to favour China over Japan during the late 1930s. Some historians, such as David Thomson, assert that the League&#x27;s &quot;inactivity and ineffectualness in the Far East lent every encouragement to European aggressors who planned similar acts of defiance&quot;.

==== Anglo-German Payments Agreement ====
The 1934 Anglo-German Payments Agreement stabilised economic relations between Britain and Germany, guaranteeing German interest repayments on bonds arising from World War I reparations and deepening British economic ties to Germany, particularly in the area of trade. Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to Britain, in 1938 characterised the agreement, alongside the 1935 naval agreement, as carrying &quot;the swaying structure of foreign relations [between the UK and Germany] even in critical periods&quot;.

====Anglo-German Naval Agreement====
The 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement had Britain permit Germany to begin rebuilding the German Navy, including its U-boats, despite Germany having repeatedly violated the Treaty of Versailles.

====Abyssinia crisis====
Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini had imperial ambitions in Abyssinia. Italy was already in possession of the neighbouring Eritrea and Somalia. In December 1934, there was a clash between Royal Italian Army and Imperial Ethiopian Army troops at Walwal, near the border between British and Italian Somaliland, in which Italian troops took possession of the disputed territory, and about 150 Abyssinians and 50 Italians were killed. Italy demanded apologies and compensation from Abyssinia, which appealed to the League, with Emperor Haile Selassie famously appealing in person to the assembly in Geneva. The League persuaded both sides to seek a settlement under the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928, but Italy continued troop movements, and Abyssinia appealed to the League again. In October 1935 Mussolini launched an attack on Abyssinia. The League declared Italy to be the aggressor and imposed sanctions, but coal and oil were not included since blocking them, it was thought, would provoke war. Albania, Austria and Hungary refused to apply sanctions, and Germany and the United States were not in the League. Nevertheless, the Italian economy suffered. The League considered closing off the Suez Canal, which would have stopped arms to Abyssinia, but thinking that would be too harsh a measure, failed to do so.

Earlier, in April 1935, Italy had joined Britain and France in protest against German rearmament. France was anxious to placate Mussolini to keep him away from an alliance with Germany. Britain was less hostile to Germany and set the pace in imposing sanctions and moved a naval fleet into the Mediterranean, but in November 1935, British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister, Pierre Laval had secret discussions in which they agreed to concede two thirds of Abyssinia to Italy. However, the press leaked the content of the discussions, and a public outcry forced Hoare and Laval to resign. In May 1936, undeterred by sanctions, Italy captured Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian capital, and proclaimed Victor Emmanuel III as Emperor of Ethiopia. In July the League abandoned sanctions. The episode, in which sanctions were incomplete and appeared to be easily given up, seriously discredited the League.

====Remilitarisation of the Rhineland====
Under the Versailles Settlement, the Rhineland was demilitarised. Germany accepted that arrangement under the Locarno Treaties of 1925. Hitler claimed that it threatened Germany and, on 7 March 1936, sent the Wehrmacht into the Rhineland. He gambled on Britain not getting involved but was unsure of how France would react. The action was opposed by many of his advisers. His officers had orders to withdraw if they met French resistance. France consulted Britain and lodged protests with the League but took no action. Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin said that Britain lacked the forces to back its guarantees to France and that in any case, public opinion would not allow so. In Britain, it was thought that the Germans were merely walking into &quot;their own backyard&quot;. Hugh Dalton, a Labour Party MP who usually advocated stiff resistance to Germany, said that neither the British people nor Labour would support military or economic sanctions. In the Council of the League, only the Soviet Union proposed sanctions against Germany. Hitler, who was invited to negotiate, proposed a non-aggression pact with the Western powers. When asked for details, he did not reply. Hitler&#x27;s occupation of the Rhineland had persuaded him that the international community would not resist him, and it put Germany in a powerful strategic position.

====Spanish Civil War====

Many historians argue that the British policy of non-intervention was a product of the Establishment&#x27;s anti-communist stance. Scott Ramsay (2019) instead argues that Britain demonstrated &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot; and was simply hedging its bets by avoiding the favouring of one side or the other. The goal was that in a European war Britain would enjoy the &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot; of whichever side won in Spain.

===Conduct of appeasement, 1937–1939===

In 1937, Stanley Baldwin resigned as Prime Minister. He was replaced by Neville Chamberlain, who pursued a policy of appeasement and rearmament. Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation for appeasement rests in large measure on his negotiations with Hitler over Czechoslovakia in 1938.

====&quot;Anschluss&quot;====

When the German Empire and Austria-Hungary were broken up in 1918, Austria was left as a rump state with the temporary adopted name &quot;Deutschösterreich&quot; (&quot;German-Austria&quot;), with the vast majority of Austrians wanting to join Germany. However, the victors&#x27; agreements of World War I (the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain) strictly forbade union between Austria and Germany without League consent, as well as the name &quot;German-Austria&quot;, which reverted to &quot;Austria&quot; after the emergence of the First Republic of Austria in September 1919. The constitutions of both the Weimar Republic and the First Republic of Austria, included the aim of unification, which was supported by democratic parties. However, the rise of Hitler dampened the enthusiasm of the Austrian government for such a plan. Hitler, an Austrian by birth, had been a pan-German from a very young age and had promoted a Pan-German vision of a Greater Germanic Reich from the beginning of his career in politics. He wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1924) that he would attempt a union of his birth country Austria with Germany by any means possible and by force if necessary. By early 1938, Hitler had consolidated his power in Germany and was ready to implement his long-held plan.

Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg wished to pursue ties with Italy but turned to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania (the Little Entente). To that end, Hitler took violent exception. In January 1938, the Austrian Nazis attempted a &quot;putsch&quot; following which some were imprisoned. Hitler summoned Schuschnigg to Berchtesgaden in February and demanded, with the threat of military action, for him to release imprisoned Austrian Nazis and to allow them to participate in the government. Schuschnigg complied and appointed Arthur Seyss-Inquart, a pro-Nazi lawyer, as interior minister. To forestall Hitler and to preserve Austria&#x27;s independence, Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite on the issue for 13 March. Hitler demanded for the plebiscite to be cancelled. The German Propaganda Ministry issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order. On 11 March, Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg that demanded him to hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion. The British Ambassador in Berlin, Nevile Henderson, registered a protest with the German government against the use of coercion against Austria. Schuschnigg, realising that neither France nor the United Kingdom would actively support him, resigned in favour of Seyss-Inquart, who then appealed to German troops to restore order. On 12 March, the German Wehrmacht crossed the Austrian border. They met no resistance and were greeted by cheering Austrians. The invasion was the first major test of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s machinery. Austria became the German province of Ostmark, with Seyss-Inquart as governor. A plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded the support of 99.73% of the voters for the &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

Although the Allies had prohibited the union of Austria and Germany, their reaction to the &quot;Anschluss&quot; was mild. Even the strongest voices against annexation, particularly those of Fascist Italy, France and Britain (the &quot;Stresa Front&quot;), were not backed by force. In the British House of Commons, Chamberlain said, &quot;The hard fact is that nothing could have arrested what has actually happened [in Austria] unless this country and other countries had been prepared to use force&quot;. The American reaction was similar. The international reaction to the events of 12 March 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his plan to expand the Third Reich. The &quot;Anschluss&quot; paved the way for Munich in September 1938 because it indicated the likely non-response of Britain and France to future German aggression.

====Munich Agreement====

Under the Versailles Settlement, Czechoslovakia was created with the territory of the Czech part more or less corresponding to the Czech Crown lands as they had existed within Austria-Hungary and earlier. The new country included Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia and had border areas with a majority-German population that was known as the Sudetenland and areas with significant numbers of other ethnic minorities (notably Hungarians, Poles and Ruthenians). In April 1938, the Sudeten German Party, led by Konrad Henlein, agitated for autonomy and then threatened, in Henlein&#x27;s words, &quot;direct action to bring the Sudeten Germans within the frontiers of the Reich&quot;. An international crisis ensued.

France and Britain advised Czechoslovak acceptance of Sudeten autonomy. The Czechoslovak government refused and ordered a partial mobilisation in expectation of German aggression. Lord Runciman was sent by Chamberlain to mediate in Prague and persuaded the Czechoslovak government to grant autonomy. Germany escalated the dispute, with the country&#x27;s press carrying stories of alleged atrocities against Sudeten Germans, and Hitler ordering 750,000 troops to the Czechoslovak border. In August, Henlein broke off negotiations with the Czechoslovak authorities. At a Nazi party rally in Nuremberg on 12 September, Hitler made a speech attacking Czechoslovakia and there was an increase of violence by Sudeten Nazis against Czechoslovak and Jewish targets.

Chamberlain, faced with the prospect of a German invasion, flew to Berchtesgaden on 15 September to negotiate directly with Hitler, who now demanded that Chamberlain accept not Sudeten self-government within Czechoslovakia but the absorption of the Sudeten lands into Germany. Chamberlain became convinced that refusal would lead to war. The geography of Europe was such that Britain and France could forcibly prevent the German occupation of the Sudetenland only by the invasion of Germany. Chamberlain, therefore, returned to Britain and agreed to Hitler&#x27;s demands. Britain and France told the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš to hand over to Germany all territory with a German majority. Hitler increased his aggression against Czechoslovakia and ordered the establishment of a Sudeten German paramilitary organisation, which proceeded to carry out terrorist attacks on Czechoslovak targets.

====German annexation of Sudetenland====
On 22 September, Chamberlain flew to Bad Godesberg for his second meeting with Hitler and said that he was willing to accept the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. He was startled by the response of Hitler that the cession of the Sudetenland was not enough and that Czechoslovakia, which Hitler had described as a &quot;fraudulent state&quot;, must be broken up completely. Later in the day, Hitler resiled by saying that he was willing to accept the cession of the Sudetenland by 1 October. On 24 September, Germany issued the Godesberg Memorandum, which demanded cession by 28 September or war. The Czechoslovak government rejected those demands, France ordered mobilisation and Britain mobilised the Royal Navy.
On 26 September, Hitler made a speech at the Sportpalast in Berlin in which he claimed that the Sudetenland was &quot;the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe&quot;, and he gave Czechoslovakia an ultimatum of 28 September at 2:00pm to cede the territory to Germany or to face war.

In the atmosphere of growing conflict, Mussolini persuaded Hitler to put the dispute to a four-power conference. On 29 September 1938, Hitler, Chamberlain, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and Mussolini met in Munich. Czechoslovakia was not to be a party to these talks, nor was the Soviet Union. The four powers agreed that Germany would complete its occupation of the Sudetenland but that an international commission would consider other disputed areas. Czechoslovakia was told that if it did not submit, it would stand alone. At Chamberlain&#x27;s request, Hitler readily signed an agreement for between the United Kingdom and Germany. Chamberlain returned to Britain and promised &quot;peace for our time&quot;. Before Munich, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had sent a telegram to Chamberlain that said, &quot;Good man&quot; and he later told the American ambassador in Rome, William Phillips, &quot;I am not a bit upset over the final result&quot;.

====First Vienna Award and German annexation of Bohemia and Moravia====

As a result of the annexation of the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia lost 800,000 citizens, much of its industry and its mountain defences in the west. The rest of Czechoslovakia was left weak and powerless to resist subsequent occupation. In the following months, Czechoslovakia was broken up and ceased to exist, as Germany occupied the Sudetenland; Hungary took part of Slovakia, including Carpathian Ruthenia; and Poland annexed Trans-Olza. On 15 March 1939, the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; moved into the remainder of Czechoslovakia, and from Prague Castle, Hitler proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia to be the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, completing the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Slovakia separated and became a German satellite state.

In March 1939, Chamberlain foresaw a possible disarmament conference between himself, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Home Secretary, Samuel Hoare, said, &quot;These five men, working together in Europe and blessed in their efforts by the President of the United States of America, might make themselves eternal benefactors of the human race&quot;.

In effect, the British and French had by the Munich negotiations pressured their ally Czechoslovakia to cede part of its territory to a hostile neighbour in order to preserve peace. Churchill likened the negotiations at Berchtesgarten, Bad Godesberg and Munich to a man demanding £1, then, when it is offered, demanding £2, then when it is refused settling for £1.17s.6d. British leaders committed to the Munich Agreement in spite of their awareness of Hitler&#x27;s vulnerability at the time. In August 1938, General Ludwig Beck relayed a message to Lord Halifax to explain that most of the German General Staff had prepared a coup against the Fuhrer for if there was &quot;proof that England will fight if Czechoslovakia is attacked&quot;. When Chamberlain received the news, he dismissed it out of hand. In September, the British received assurance that the General Staff&#x27;s offer to launch the coup still stood with key private sector police and army support, even though Beck had resigned his post. Chamberlain ultimately ceded to all of Hitler&#x27;s demands at Munich because he believed Britain and Nazi Germany were &quot;the two pillars of European peace and buttresses against communism&quot;.

Czechoslovakia had a modern well-prepared military, and Hitler, on entering Prague, conceded that a war would have cost Germany much blood but the decision by France and Britain not to defend Czechoslovakia in the event of war and the exclusion from the equation of the Soviet Union, which Chamberlain distrusted, meant that the outcome would have been uncertain. The event forms the main part of what became known as Munich betrayal () in Czechoslovakia and the rest of Eastern Europe, as the Czechoslovak view was that Britain and France had pressured it to cede territory to prevent a major war, which would involve Western Europe. The Western view is that the pressure was done to save Czechoslovakia from total annihilation.

====German annexation of Lithuania&#x27;s Klaipėda Region====

Rumours had reached the Lithuanian government to the effect that Germany had specific plans to take over Klaipėda. On 12 March 1939, Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys represented Lithuania at the coronation of Pope Pius XII in Rome. On Urbšys&#x27;s return to Lithuania, he stopped in Berlin with the hope of clarifying the growing rumours. On 20 March, just five days after the German occupation of Prague, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop agreed to meet Urbšys but not the Lithuanian Ambassador to Berlin, Kazys Škirpa, who was asked to wait in another room. The conversation lasted for about 40 minutes. Ribbentrop demanded the return of Klaipėda to Germany and threatened military action. Urbšys relayed the verbal ultimatum to the Lithuanian government. Because the ultimatum was never set down in writing and did not include a formal deadline, some historians downplay its importance and describe it as a &quot;set of demands&quot;, rather than as an ultimatum. However, it was made clear that force would be used should Lithuania resist, and Lithuania was warned not to seek help from other nations. A clear deadline was not given, but Lithuania was told to make a speedy decision and that any clashes or German casualties would inevitably provoke a response from the German military.

Lithuania secretly informed the signatories of the Klaipėda Convention about those demands since technically, Lithuania could not transfer Klaipėda without the signatories&#x27; approvals. Italy and Japan supported Germany in the matter, and the United Kingdom and France expressed sympathy for Lithuania but chose not to offer any material assistance and followed a well-publicized policy of appeasement. The British treated the issue in the same way as the earlier Sudeten Crisis and made no plans to assist Lithuania or the other Baltic States if they were attacked by Germany. The Soviets supported Lithuania in principle but did not wish to disrupt their relations with Germany since they were contemplating the German-Soviet Pact. Without any material international support, Lithuania had no choice but to accept the ultimatum. Lithuanian diplomacy characterized the concession as a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to enable Lithuania to preserve its independence, and it maintained the hope that it was merely a temporary retreat.

====Outbreak of World War II and Phoney War====

By August 1939, Hitler was convinced that the democratic nations would never put up any effective opposition to him. He expressed his contempt for them in a speech that he delivered to his Commanders in Chief: &quot;Our enemies have leaders who are below the average. No personalities. No masters, no men of action... Our enemies are small fry. I saw them in Munich&quot;.

On 1 September 1939, German forces started their invasion of Poland. Britain and France joined the war against Germany but initially averted serious military involvement during the period known as the Phoney War. After the German invasion of Norway, opinion turned against Chamberlain&#x27;s conduct of the war. He resigned after the Norway Debate in the British House of Commons, and on 10 May 1940 Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. In July, after the Fall of France, when Britain stood almost alone against Germany, Hitler offered peace. Some politicians both inside and outside the government were willing to consider the offer, but Churchill refused to do so. Chamberlain died on 9 November the same year. Churchill delivered a tribute to him in which he said, &quot;Whatever else history may or may not say about these terrible, tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged&quot;.

==Attitudes==
As the policy of appeasement failed to prevent war, those who advocated it were quickly criticised. Appeasement came to be seen as something to be avoided by those with responsibility for the diplomacy of Britain or any other democratic country. By contrast, the few who stood out against appeasement were seen as &quot;voices in the wilderness whose wise counsels were largely ignored, with almost catastrophic consequences for the nation in 1939–40&quot;. More recently, however, historians have questioned the accuracy of that simple distinction between appeasers and anti-appeasers. &quot;Few appeasers were really prepared to seek peace at any price; few, if any, anti-appeasers were prepared for Britain to make a stand against aggression whatever the circumstances and wherever the location in which it occurred&quot;.

===Avoiding mistakes of First World War===
Chamberlain&#x27;s policy in many respects continued the policies of MacDonald and Baldwin and was popular until the failure of the Munich Agreement to stop Hitler in Czechoslovakia. &quot;Appeasement&quot; had been a respectable term between 1919 and 1937 to signify the pursuit of peace. Many believed after the First World War that wars were started by mistake, in which case the League of Nations could prevent them; or that they were caused by large-scale armaments, in which case disarmament was the remedy; or that they were caused by national grievances, in which case the grievances should be redressed peacefully. Many thought that the Versailles Treaty had been unjust, that the German minorities were entitled to self-determination, and that Germany was entitled to equality in armaments.

===Government views===
Appeasement was accepted by most of those responsible for British foreign policy in the 1930s; by leading journalists and academics; and by members of the British royal family such as King Edward VIII and his successor, George VI. Anti-communism was sometimes acknowledged as a deciding factor, as mass labour unrest resurfaced in Britain, and news of Stalin&#x27;s bloody purges disturbed the West. A common upper-class slogan was &quot;better Hitlerism than Communism&quot;. In France, right-wingers were sometimes accused of believing &quot;Better Hitler than Blum&quot; in reference to the French Socialist Prime Minister Léon Blum at the time. Anti-communism was a motive of a close ally of Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, who said after he had visited Göring and met Hitler in Germany in 1936 and 1937: &quot;Nationalism and Racialism is a powerful force but I can&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s either unnatural or immoral! I cannot myself doubt that these fellows are genuine haters of Communism, etc.! And I daresay if we were in their position we might feel the same!&quot;

Most Conservative MPs were also in favour, but Churchill said that their supporters were divided and in 1936 led a delegation of leading Conservative politicians to express to Baldwin their alarm about the speed of German rearmament and the fact that Britain was falling behind. Baldwin rejected their sense of urgency and declared that he would not get Britain to war with anybody &quot;for the League of Nations or anybody else&quot; and that if there were to be any fighting in Europe, &quot;I should like to see the Bolshies and Nazis doing it&quot;. Amongst Conservatives, Churchill was unusual in believing that Germany menaced freedom and democracy, that British rearmament should proceed more rapidly and that Germany should be resisted over Czechoslovakia. His criticism of Hitler began from the start of the decade, but Churchill was slow to attack fascism overall because of his own vitriolic opposition to communists, &quot;international Jews&quot; and socialism generally. Churchill&#x27;s sustained warnings about fascism commenced only in 1938 after Francisco Franco, who was receiving aid from Italy and Germany during the Spanish Civil War, decimated the left in Spain.

The week before Munich, Churchill warned, &quot;The partition of Czechoslovakia under pressure from the UK and France amounts to the complete surrender of the Western Democracies to the Nazi threat of force. Such a collapse will bring peace or security neither to the UK nor to France&quot;. He and a few other Conservatives who refused to vote for the Munich settlement were attacked by their local constituency parties. However, Churchill&#x27;s subsequent leadership of Britain during the war and his role in creating the post-war consensus against appeasement have tended to obscure the fact that &quot;his contemporary criticism of totalitarian regimes other than Hitler&#x27;s Germany was at best muted&quot;. It was not until May 1938 that he began &quot;consistently to withhold his support from the National Government&#x27;s conduct of foreign policy in the division lobbies of the House of Commons&quot;. He seems &quot;to have been convinced by the Sudeten German leader, Henlein, in the spring of 1938, that a satisfactory settlement could be reached if Britain managed to persuade the Czech government to make concessions to the German minority&quot;.

===Military views===
In Britain, the Royal Navy generally favoured appeasement although it was during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1937 that it was confident it could easily defeat the Royal Italian Navy in open warfare. However, it favoured appeasement because it did not want to commit a large fraction of its naval power to the Mediterranean Sea, which would weaken its positions against Germany and Japan. In 1938, the Royal Navy approved appeasement regarding Munich because it calculated that Britain then lacked the political and military resources to intervene and to maintain an imperial defence capability simultaneously.

Public opinion in Britain throughout the 1930s was frightened by the prospect of German terror bombing of British cities, which had started during the First World War. The media emphasised the dangers, and the general consensus was that defence was impossible and, as Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin had said in 1932, &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;. However, the Royal Air Force had two major weapons systems in the works: better interceptors (Hurricanes and Spitfires) and especially radar. They promised to counter the German bombing offensive but were not yet ready and so appeasement was necessary to cause a delay. Specifically, regarding the fighters, the RAF warned the government in October 1938 that the German Luftwaffe bombers would probably get through: &quot;the situation... will be definitely unsatisfactory throughout the next twelve months&quot;.

In France, the Armée de l&#x27;Air intelligence section closely examined the strength of the Luftwaffe and decided the German pursuit planes and bombers were the best in the world and that the Germans were producing 1000 warplanes a month. It perceived decisive German air superiority and so it was pessimistic about its ability to defend Czechoslovakia in 1938. Guy La Chambre, the civilian air minister, optimistically informed the government that the air force could stop the Luftwaffe. However, General Joseph Vuillemin, air force chief of staff, warned that it was far inferior and consistently opposed war against Germany.

===Opposition parties===
The Labour Party opposed the fascist dictators on principle but until the late 1930s also opposed rearmament and had a significant pacifist wing. In 1935, its pacifist leader, George Lansbury, resigned after a party resolution in favour of sanctions against Italy, which he opposed. He was replaced by Clement Attlee, who at first opposed rearmament by advocating the abolition of national armaments and a world peacekeeping force under the direction of the League of Nations. However, with the rising threat from Nazi Germany and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, that policy eventually lost credibility, and in 1937, Ernest Bevin and Hugh Dalton persuaded the party to support rearmament and oppose appeasement.

A few on the left said that Chamberlain looked forward to a war between Germany and the Soviet Union. Attlee claimed in one political speech in 1937 that the National Government had connived at German rearmament &quot;because of its hatred of Russia&quot;. British communists, following the party line defined by Joseph Stalin, argued that appeasement had been a pro-fascist policy and that the British ruling class preferred fascism to socialism. The Communist MP Willie Gallacher said that &quot;many prominent representatives of the Conservative Party, speaking for powerful landed and financial interests in the country, would welcome Hitler and the German Army if they believed that such was the only alternative to the establishment of Socialism in this country&quot;.

===Public opinion===
British public opinion had been strongly opposed to war and rearmament in the early 1930s, but that began to shift by mid-decade. At a debate at the Oxford Union Society in 1933, a group of undergraduates passed a motion saying that they would not fight for King and country, which persuaded some in Germany that Britain would never go to war. Baldwin told the House of Commons that in 1933, he had been unable to pursue a policy of rearmament because of the strong pacifist sentiment in the country. In 1935, eleven million responded to the League of Nations &quot;Peace Ballot&quot; by pledging support for the reduction of armaments by international agreement. On the other hand, the same survey also found that 58.7% of British voters favoured &quot;collective military sanctions&quot; against aggressors, and public reaction to the Hoare-Laval Pact with Mussolini was extremely unfavorable. Even the left wing of the pacifist movement quickly began to turn with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, and many peace-balloters began signing up for the International Brigades to fight Franco. By the height of the Spanish conflict in 1937, the majority of young pacifists had modified their views to accept that war could be a legitimate response to aggression and fascism.

Czechoslovakia did not concern most people until mid-September 1938, when they began to object to a small democratic state being bullied. Nevertheless, the initial response of the British public to the Munich agreement was generally favourable. As Chamberlain left for Munich in 1938, the whole House of Commons cheered him noisily. On 30 September, on his return to Britain, Chamberlain delivered his famous &quot;peace for our time&quot; speech to delighted crowds. He was invited by the royal family onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace before he had reported to Parliament. The agreement was supported by most of the press, with only &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot; and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; dissenting. In Parliament, the Labour Party opposed the agreement. Some Conservatives abstained in the vote, but the only MP to advocate war was the Conservative Duff Cooper, who had resigned from the government to protest the agreement.

===Role of media===
Positive opinion of appeasement was shaped partly by media manipulation. The German correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, Norman Ebbutt, charged that his persistent reports about Nazi militarism had been suppressed by his editor, Geoffrey Dawson. Historians such as Richard Cockett, William Shirer and Frank McDonough have confirmed the claim. The results of an October 1938 Gallup poll, which showed 86% of the public believed Hitler was lying about his future territorial ambitions, was censored from the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; at the last minute by the publisher, who was loyal to Chamberlain. For the few journalists who were asking challenging questions about appeasement, primarily members of the foreign press, Chamberlain often froze them out or intimidated them. When asked at press conferences about Hitler&#x27;s abuse of Jews and other minority groups, he went so far as to denounce these reports as &quot;Jewish-Communist propaganda&quot;.

Chamberlain&#x27;s direct manipulation of the BBC was sustained and egregious. For example, Lord Halifax told radio producers not to offend Hitler and Mussolini, and they complied by censoring anti-fascist commentary made by Labour and Popular Front MPs. The BBC also suppressed the fact that 15,000 people protested the prime minister in Trafalgar Square as he returned from Munich in 1938 (10,000 more than welcomed him at 10 Downing Street). The BBC radio producers continued to censor news of persecution of Jews even after the war broken out, as Chamberlain still held out hopes of a quick armistice and did not want to inflame the atmosphere. As Richard Cockett noted:

[Chamberlain] had successfully demonstrated how a government in a democracy could influence and control the press to a remarkable degree. The danger in this for Chamberlain was that he preferred to forget that he exercised such influence, and so increasingly mistook his pliant press for real public opinion... the truth of the matter was that by controlling the press he was merely ensuring that the press was unable to reflect public opinion.

The journalist Shiela Grant Duff&#x27;s Penguin Special, &quot;Europe and the Czechs&quot;, was published and distributed to every MP on the day that Chamberlain returned from Munich. Her book was a spirited defence of the Czech nation and a detailed criticism of British policy and confronted the need for war if necessary. It was influential and widely read. Although she argued against the policy of &quot;peace at almost any price&quot;, she did not take a personal tone, unlike &quot;Guilty Men&quot; two years later.

===At start of World War II===
Once Germany invaded Poland and so ignited World War II, consensus was that appeasement was responsible. The Labour MP Hugh Dalton identified the policy with wealthy people in the City of London, Conservatives and members of the peerage who were soft on Hitler. The appointment of Churchill as Prime Minister after the Norway Debate hardened opinion against appeasement and encouraged the search for those responsible. Three British journalists, Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard, writing under the name of &quot;Cato&quot; in their book &quot;Guilty Men&quot;, called for the removal from office of 15 public figures they held accountable, including Chamberlain. The book defined appeasement as the &quot;deliberate surrender of small nations in the face of Hitler&#x27;s blatant bullying&quot;. It was hastily written and has few claims to historical scholarship, but &quot;Guilty Men&quot; shaped subsequent thinking about appeasement, and it is said that it contributed to the defeat of the Conservatives in the 1945 general election.

The change in the meaning of &quot;appeasement&quot; after Munich was summarised later by the historian David Dilks: &quot;The word in its normal meaning connotes the pacific settlement of disputes; in the meaning usually applied to the period of Neville Chamberlain[&#x27;s] premiership, it has come to indicate something sinister, the granting from fear or cowardice of unwarranted concessions in order to buy temporary peace at someone else&#x27;s expense.&quot;

===Postwar historians===

Historians have subsequently explained Chamberlain&#x27;s policies in various ways. It could be said that he believed sincerely that the objectives of Hitler and Mussolini were limited, and that the settlement of their grievances would protect the world from war since for safety, military and air power should be strengthened.

One of the first dissents to the prevailing criticism of appeasement was made by John F. Kennedy in his 1940 Harvard College thesis, &quot;Why England Slept&quot;, in which he argued that appeasement had been necessary because the United Kingdom and France were unprepared for a world war.

In 1961, the view of appeasement as avoidable error and cowardice was similarly set on its head by A.J.P. Taylor in his book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;. Taylor argued that Hitler did not have a blueprint for war and behaved much as any other German leader might have. Appeasement was an active policy, not a passive one, and allowing Hitler to consolidate was a policy implemented by &quot;men confronted with real problems, doing their best in the circumstances of their time&quot;. Taylor said that appeasement ought to be seen as a rational response to an unpredictable leader that was both diplomatically and politically appropriate to the time.

His view has been shared by other historians. For example, Paul Kennedy, who says of the choices facing politicians at the time, &quot;Each course brought its share of disadvantages: there was only a choice of evils. The crisis in the British global position by this time was such that it was, in the last resort, insoluble, in the sense that there was no good or proper solution&quot;. Martin Gilbert expressed a similar view: &quot;At bottom, the old appeasement was a mood of hope, Victorian in its optimism, Burkean in its belief that societies evolved from bad to good and that progress could only be for the better. The new appeasement was a mood of fear, Hobbesian in its insistence upon swallowing the bad in order to preserve some remnant of the good, pessimistic in its belief that Nazism was there to stay and, however horrible it might be, should be accepted as a way of life with which Britain ought to deal&quot;.

The arguments in Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Origins of the Second World War&quot;, which have sometimes been described as &quot;revisionist&quot;, were rejected by many historians at the time, and reviews of his book in Britain and the United States were generally critical. Nevertheless, he was praised for some of his insights. By showing that appeasement was a popular policy and that there was a continuity in British foreign policy after 1933, he shattered the common view of the appeasers as a small degenerate clique that had mysteriously hijacked the British government sometime in the 1930s that had carried out their policies in the face of massive public resistance. Also, by portraying the leaders of the 1930s as real people attempting to deal with real problems, he made the first strides towards explaining the actions of the appeasers, rather than merely condemning them.

In the early 1990s a new theory of appeasement, sometimes called &quot;counter-revisionist&quot;, emerged as historians argued that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s but that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. Appeasement was considered a viable policy because of the strains that the British Empire faced in recuperating from World War I, and Chamberlain was said to have adopted a policy suitable to Britain&#x27;s cultural and political needs. Frank McDonough is a leading proponent of that view of appeasement, which was described his book &quot;Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War&quot; as a &quot;post revisionist&quot; study. Appeasement was a crisis management strategy seeking a peaceful settlement of Hitler&#x27;s grievances. &quot;Chamberlain&#x27;s worst error&quot;, says McDonough, &quot;was to believe that he could march Hitler on the yellow brick road to peace when in reality Hitler was marching very firmly on the road to war&quot;. He criticised revisionist historians for concentrating on Chamberlain&#x27;s motivations, rather than how appeasement worked in practice, as a &quot;usable policy&quot; to deal with Hitler. James P. Levy argues against the outright condemnation of appeasement. &quot;Knowing what Hitler did later&quot;, he writes, &quot;the critics of Appeasement condemn the men who tried to keep the peace in the 1930s, men who could not know what would come later... The political leaders responsible for Appeasement made many errors. They were not blameless. But what they attempted was logical, rational, and humane&quot;.

The view of Chamberlain colluding with Hitler to attack the Soviet Union has persisted, however, particularly on the far left. In 1999, Christopher Hitchens wrote that Chamberlain &quot;had made a cold calculation that Hitler should be re-armed... partly to encourage his &#x27;tough-minded&#x27; solution to the Bolshevik problem in the East&quot;. Consciously encouraging war with Stalin is not widely accepted to be a motive of the Downing Street appeasers, but there is a historical consensus that anti-communism was central to appeasement&#x27;s appeal for the conservative elite. As Antony Beevor writes, &quot;The policy of appeasement was not Neville Chamberlin&#x27;s invention. Its roots lay in a fear of bolshevism. The general strike of 1926 and the depression made the possibility of revolution a very real concern to conservative politicians. As a result, they had mixed feelings towards the German and Italian regimes which had crushed the communists and socialists in their own countries&quot;.

===Postwar politicians===

Statesmen in the postwar years have often referred to their opposition to appeasement as a justification for firm, sometimes armed, action in international relations.

==== United States ====
U.S. President Harry S. Truman thus explained his decision to enter the Korean War in 1950, British Prime Minister Anthony Eden in his confrontation of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the Suez Crisis of 1956, U.S. President John F. Kennedy his &quot;quarantine&quot; of Cuba in 1962, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in his resistance to communism in Indochina in the 1960s, U.S. President Ronald Reagan in his air strike on Libya in 1986, and U.S. President Donald Trump in the drone strike that led to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020.

==== Vietnam ====
After the Viet Minh won the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in a letter to British Prime Minister Churchill, &quot;We failed to halt Hirohito, Mussolini and Hitler by not acting in unity and in time. That marked the beginning of many years of stark tragedy and desperate peril. May it not be that our nations have learned something from that lesson?&quot; Similarly, President Lyndon Johnson said to defend the Vietnam War, &quot;Everything I knew about history told me that if I got out of Vietnam and let Ho Chi Minh run through the streets of Saigon, then I&#x27;d be doing exactly what Chamberlain did in World War II. I&#x27;d be giving a big fat reward to aggression&quot;.

==== Cuba ====
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay and various hawks within the Kennedy administration for an air strike on Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba compared Kennedy&#x27;s hesitance to do so to appeasement. That was partially a jab at Kennedy&#x27;s father Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who had supported appeasement while he was U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and later supported a negotiated surrender to Germany during the May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis and the Battle of Britain.

==== Soviet Union ====
During the Cold War, the &quot;lessons&quot; of appeasement were cited by prominent conservative allies of Reagan, who urged him to be assertive in &quot;rolling back&quot; Soviet-backed regimes throughout the world. The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Michael Johns, for instance, wrote in 1987 that &quot;seven years after Ronald Reagan&#x27;s arrival in Washington, the United States government and its allies are still dominated by the culture of appeasement that drove Neville Chamberlain to Munich in 1938.&quot; Some conservatives even compared Reagan to Chamberlain after his withdrawal of the Multinational Force in Lebanon because of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

==== Argentina ====
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher invoked the example of Churchill during the Falklands War of 1982: &quot;When the American Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, urged her to reach a compromise with the Argentines she rapped sharply on the table and told him, pointedly, &#x27;that this was the table at which Neville Chamberlain sat in 1938 and spoke of the Czechs as a faraway people about whom we know so little&#x27;&quot;. Thatcher, along with U.S. National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, made similar arguments after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the planning for the Gulf War. The spectre of appeasement was raised in discussions of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.

==== Iraq ====
U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair also cited Churchill&#x27;s warnings about German rearmament to justify their action in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War.

==== Syria ====
In 2013, Obama administration officials such as Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel claimed that a failure of the United States to intervene in the Syrian Civil War after the Ghouta chemical attack would be an act of appeasement towards Bashar al-Assad.

==== Iran ====

In May 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush cautioned against &quot;the false comfort of appeasement&quot; when dealing with Iran and 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Opponents of President Barack Obama later criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as an act of appeasement with Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later stated that the Trump administration&#x27;s foreign policy was &quot;trying to correct for what was the Obama administration&#x27;s appeasement of Iran.&quot;

==== China ====
Tibetan separatists consider the policy of the West towards the People&#x27;s Republic of China with regard to Tibet as appeasement.

==== Russia ====
The minimal international reactions to the invasion of Chechnya, the invasion of Georgia and the 2014 annexation of Crimea, as well as the conflict in the Donbas, which all stand in violation of international law, is seen by some as the cause that encouraged Russian president Vladimir Putin to conduct a full-scale invasion of the rest of Ukraine in 2022.

Some commentators have suggested that some NATO countries are following the policy of appeasement towards Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia by rejecting the support of Ukrainian democracy through military operations and aid during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==== North Korea ====
==== Afghanistan ====
The 2020 Doha Agreement between the United States and the Taliban without involvement of the then Afghan government was criticized as the American appeasement of the Taliban. Over the American war in Afghanistan, the United States and its NATO allies (ISAF and RSM periods) along with the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and its national defense and security forces warred against the Taliban and its allied militant groups and later the Islamic State – Khorasan Province. After Donald Trump become the president, he decided to wrap up all military operations in Afghanistan and to begin negotiation with the Taliban, which culminated with the Doha Agreement on 29 February 2020. After President Joe Biden decided to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan on 31 August 2021, the Taliban launched their final offensive of the war, which brought the fall of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, during which Kabul was taken over by the Taliban on 15 August 2021. The United States completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan and the evacuation of American citizens and residents and at-risk Afghans from Kabul International Airport on 30 August 2021.

==Criticism==
In the mid-20th century, appeasement was seen as discredited in the United Kingdom due to its role in contributing to World War II.

Scholar Aaron McKeil pointed out that appeasement restraint against liberal interventionism would lead to more proxy wars, and fail to offer institutions and norms for mitigating great power conflict. Alternative strategies to avoid conflict include deterrence, where threats or limited force dissuades an actor from escalating conflict, typically because the prospective attacker believes that the probability of success is low and the costs of attack are high.

Appeasement can be seen as promoting frozen conflicts and rewarding aggression from a game-theoretical point of view. If the defensive player is willing to appease, the offensive player is incentivised to create the conditions to be appeased by their opponent.

Appeasement might be more difficult to achieve if the source of conflict is indivisible and can be held by only one party, preventing small concessions.

The case of peacebuilding in Timor-Leste can be seen as appeasement to avoid conflict without addressing underlying conflict grievances.

The Minsk agreements have been called by some as appeasement, which subsequently failed to prevent the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Appeasement can face the dilemma where appeasing a group of former rebels can increase grievances with new groups.

<text>Venera 4V-2 () was a series of two identical spacecraft sent to Venus by the Soviet Union, consisting of Venera 15 and Venera 16. Both uncrewed orbiters were to map the surface of Venus using high resolution imaging systems. The spacecraft were identical and based on modifications to the earlier Venera space probes.

==Mission profile==
Venera 15 was launched on June 2, 1983, at 02:38:39 UTC, and Venera 16 on June 7, 1983, at 02:32:00 UTC. Venera 15 and Venera 16 both reached Venus&#x27; orbit (on October 10, 1983, and October 14, 1983, respectively).

The two spacecraft were inserted into Venus orbit a day apart with their orbital planes shifted by an angle of approximately 4° relative to one another. This made it possible to reimage an area if necessary. Each spacecraft was in a nearly polar orbit with a periapsis ~1000 km, at 62°N latitude, and apoapsis ~65000 km, with an inclination ~90°, the orbital period being ~24 hours.

In June 1984, Venus was at superior conjunction and passed behind the Sun as seen from Earth. No transmissions were possible, so the orbit of Venera 16 was rotated back 20° at this time to map the areas missed during this period.

Together, the two spacecraft imaged the area from the north pole down to about 30°N latitude (i.e. approx. 25% of Venus surface) over the 8 months of mapping operations.

==Spacecraft structure==
The Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft were identical and were based on modifications to the orbiter portions of the Venera 9 and Venera 14 probes. Each spacecraft consisted of a 5 m long cylinder with a 0.6 m diameter, 1.4 m tall parabolic dish antenna for the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at one end. A 1-meter diameter parabolic dish antenna for the radio altimeter was also located at this end. The electrical axis of the radio altimeter antenna was lined up with the axis of the cylinder. The electrical axis of the SAR deviated from the spacecraft axis by 10 degrees. During imaging, the radio altimeter would be lined up with the center of the planet (local vertical) and the SAR would be looking off to the side at 10 degrees. A bulge at the opposite end of the cylinder held fuel tanks and propulsion units. Two square solar arrays extended like wings from the sides of the cylinder. A 2.6 m radio dish antenna for communications was also attached to the side of the cylinder. The spacecraft each massed 4000 kg.

Both Venera 15 and 16 were equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). A radar was necessary in this mission because nothing else would be able to penetrate the dense clouds of Venus. The probes were equipped with on board computers that saved the images until the entire image was complete.

<text>Infrasound, sometimes referred to as low frequency sound or incorrectly subsonic (subsonic being a descriptor for &quot;less than the speed of sound&quot;), describes sound waves with a frequency below the lower limit of human audibility (generally 20 Hz, as defined by the ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013 standard). Hearing becomes gradually less sensitive as frequency decreases, so for humans to perceive infrasound, the sound pressure must be sufficiently high. Although the ear is the primary organ for sensing low sound, at higher intensities it is possible to feel infrasound vibrations in various parts of the body.

The study of such sound waves is sometimes referred to as infrasonics, covering sounds beneath 20 Hz down to 0.1 Hz (and rarely to 0.001 Hz). People use this frequency range for monitoring earthquakes and volcanoes, charting rock and petroleum formations below the earth, and also in ballistocardiography and seismocardiography to study the mechanics of the human cardiovascular system.

Infrasound is characterized by an ability to get around obstacles with little dissipation. In music, acoustic waveguide methods, such as a large pipe organ or, for reproduction, exotic loudspeaker designs such as transmission line, rotary woofer, or traditional subwoofer designs can produce low-frequency sounds, including near-infrasound. Subwoofers designed to produce infrasound are capable of sound reproduction an octave or more below that of most commercially available subwoofers, and are often about 10 times the size.

== History and study ==
One of the pioneers in infrasonic research was French scientist Vladimir Gavreau. His interest in infrasonic waves first came about in 1957 in the large concrete building that he and his research team were working in. The group was experiencing bouts of periodic and deeply unpleasant nausea. After weeks of speculation on the source of the nausea — the team was convinced that it was a pathogen or an untraced leak of noxious chemical fumes in the facility — they discovered that a &quot;loosely poised low speed motor... was developing [these] &#x27;nauseating vibrations&#x27;&quot;.

When Gavreau and the team attempted to measure an amplitude and pitch, they were shocked when their equipment detected no audible sound. They concluded the sound being generated by the motor was so low in pitch that it was below their biological ability to hear, and that their recording equipment was not capable of detecting these frequencies. Nobody had conceived that sound might exist at such low frequencies, and so no equipment had been developed to detect it. Eventually, it was determined that the sound inducing the nausea was a 7 cycle per second infrasound wave that was inducing a resonant mode in the ductwork and architecture of the building, significantly amplifying the sound. In the wake of this serendipitous discovery, the researchers soon got to work preparing further infrasonic tests in the laboratories. One of his experiments was an infrasonic whistle, an oversized organ pipe. As a result of this and similar incidents, it has become routine in new architecture construction to inspect for and eliminate any infrasonic resonances in cavities and the introduction of sound-proofing and materials with specialized sonic properties.

== Sources ==

Infrasound can result from both natural and man-made sources:

:* Natural events: infrasonic sound sometimes results naturally from severe weather, surf, lee waves, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes, bolides, waterfalls, calving of icebergs, aurorae, meteors, lightning and upper-atmospheric lightning. Nonlinear ocean wave interactions in ocean storms produce pervasive infrasound vibrations around 0.2 Hz, known as microbaroms. According to the Infrasonics Program at NOAA, infrasonic arrays can be used to locate avalanches in the Rocky Mountains, and to detect tornadoes on the high plains several minutes before they touch down.

:* Animal communication: whales, elephants, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, okapis, peacocks, and alligators are known to use infrasound to communicate over distances—up to hundreds of miles in the case of whales. In particular, the Sumatran rhinoceros has been shown to produce sounds with frequencies as low as 3 Hz which have similarities with the song of the humpback whale. The roar of the tiger contains infrasound of 18 Hz and lower, and the purr of felines is reported to cover a range of 20 to 50 Hz. It has also been suggested that migrating birds use naturally generated infrasound, from sources such as turbulent airflow over mountain ranges, as a navigational aid. Infrasound also may be used for long-distance communication, especially well documented in baleen whales (see whale vocalization), and African elephants. The frequency of baleen whale sounds can range from 10 Hz to 31 kHz, and that of elephant calls from 15 Hz to 35 Hz. Both can be extremely loud (around 117 dB), allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around for elephants, and potentially hundreds or thousands of kilometers for some whales. Elephants also produce infrasound waves that travel through solid ground and are sensed by other herds using their feet, although they may be separated by hundreds of kilometres. These calls may be used to coordinate the movement of herds and allow mating elephants to find each other.

:* Human singers: some vocalists, including Tim Storms, can produce notes in the infrasound range.

:* Man-Made sources: infrasound can be generated by human processes such as sonic booms and explosions (both chemical and nuclear), or by machinery such as diesel engines, wind turbines and specially designed mechanical transducers (industrial vibration tables). Certain specialized loudspeaker designs are also able to reproduce extremely low frequencies; these include large-scale rotary woofer models of subwoofer loudspeaker, as well as large horn loaded, bass reflex, sealed and transmission line loudspeakers.

== Animal reaction ==
Some animals have been thought to perceive the infrasonic waves going through the earth, caused by natural disasters, and to use these as an early warning. An example of this is the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Animals were reported to have fled the area hours before the actual tsunami hit the shores of Asia. It is not known for sure that this is the cause; some have suggested that it may have been the influence of electromagnetic waves, and not of infrasonic waves, that prompted these animals to flee.

Research in 2013 by Jon Hagstrum of the US Geological Survey suggests that homing pigeons use low-frequency infrasound to navigate.

== Human reactions ==
20 Hz is considered the normal low-frequency limit of human hearing. When pure sine waves are reproduced under ideal conditions and at very high volume, a human listener will be able to identify tones as low as 12 Hz. Below 10 Hz it is possible to perceive the single cycles of the sound, along with a sensation of pressure at the eardrums.

From about 1000 Hz, the dynamic range of the auditory system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression is observable in the equal-loudness-level contours, and it implies that even a slight increase in level can change the perceived loudness from barely audible to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population, its effect may be that a very low-frequency sound which is inaudible to some people may be loud to others.

One study has suggested that infrasound may cause feelings of awe or fear in humans. It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, it may make people feel vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place.

A scientist working at Sydney University&#x27;s Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory reports growing evidence that infrasound may affect some people&#x27;s nervous system by stimulating the vestibular system, and this has shown in animal models an effect similar to sea sickness.

In research conducted in 2006 focusing on the impact of sound emissions from wind turbines on the nearby population, perceived infrasound has been associated to effects such as annoyance or fatigue, depending on its intensity, with little evidence supporting physiological effects of infrasound below the human perception threshold. Later studies, however, have linked inaudible infrasound to effects such as fullness, pressure or tinnitus, and acknowledged the possibility that it could disturb sleep. Other studies have also suggested associations between noise levels in turbines and self-reported sleep disturbances in the nearby population, while adding that the contribution of infrasound to this effect is still not fully understood.

In a study at Ibaraki University in Japan, researchers said EEG tests showed that the infrasound produced by wind turbines was &quot;considered to be an annoyance to the technicians who work close to a modern large-scale wind turbine&quot;.

Jürgen Altmann of the Technical University of Dortmund, an expert on sonic weapons, has said that there is no reliable evidence for nausea and vomiting caused by infrasound.

High volume levels at concerts from subwoofer arrays have been cited as causing lung collapse in individuals who are very close to the subwoofers, especially for smokers who are particularly tall and thin.

In September 2009, London student Tom Reid died in a club of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) after complaining that &quot;loud bass notes&quot; from the club&#x27;s speakers were &quot;getting to his heart&quot;. The inquest recorded a verdict of natural causes, although some experts commented that the bass could have acted as a trigger.

Air is a very inefficient medium for transferring low frequency vibration from a transducer to the human body. Mechanical connection of the vibration source to the human body, however, provides a potentially dangerous combination. The U.S. space program, worried about the harmful effects of rocket flight on astronauts, ordered vibration tests that used cockpit seats mounted on vibration tables to transfer &quot;brown note&quot; and other frequencies directly to the human subjects. Very high power levels of 160 dB were achieved at frequencies of 2–3 Hz. Test frequencies ranged from 0.5 Hz to 40 Hz. Test subjects suffered motor ataxia, nausea, visual disturbance, degraded task performance and difficulties in communication. These tests are assumed by researchers to be the nucleus of the current urban myth surrounding the &quot;brown note&quot; and its effects.

The report &quot;A Review of Published Research on Low Frequency Noise and its Effects&quot; contains a long list of research about exposure to high-level infrasound among humans and animals. For instance, in 1972, Borredon exposed 42 young men to tones at 7.5 Hz at 130 dB for 50 minutes. This exposure caused no adverse effects other than reported drowsiness and a slight blood pressure increase. In 1975, Slarve and Johnson exposed four male subjects to infrasound at frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz, for eight minutes at a time, at levels up to 144 dB SPL. There was no evidence of any detrimental effect other than middle ear discomfort. Tests of high-intensity infrasound on animals resulted in measurable changes, such as cell changes and ruptured blood vessel walls.

Infrasound is one hypothesized cause of death for the nine Soviet hikers who were found dead at Dyatlov Pass in 1959.

=== Hygienic standards in the workplace ===
US: Maximum levels for frequencies from 1 to 80 Hz are no more than 145 dB. Overall level (for all frequencies) - no more than 150 dB.

=== Brown note ===
The brown note is a hypothetical infrasonic frequency capable of causing fecal incontinence by creating acoustic resonance in the human bowel. Attempts to demonstrate the existence of a &quot;brown note&quot; using sound waves transmitted through the air have failed.

In February 2005 the television show &quot;MythBusters&quot; attempted to verify whether the &quot;brown note&quot; was a reality. They tested notes down to 5 Hz in frequency and up to 153 dB in sound pressure. They used a type subwoofer used for major rock concerts, and which had been specially modified for deeper bass extension. The rumored physiological effects did not materialize. The show declared the brown note myth &quot;busted.&quot;

=== &quot;Infrasonic&quot; 17 Hz tone experiment ===
On 31 May 2003, a group of UK researchers held a mass experiment, where they exposed some 700 people to music laced with soft 17 Hz sine waves played at a level described as &quot;near the edge of hearing&quot;, produced by an extra-long-stroke subwoofer mounted two-thirds of the way from the end of a seven-meter-long plastic sewer pipe. The experimental concert (entitled &quot;Infrasonic&quot;) took place in the Purcell Room over the course of two performances, each consisting of four musical pieces. Two of the pieces in each concert had 17 Hz tones played underneath.

In the second concert, the pieces that were to carry a 17 Hz undertone were swapped so that test results would not focus on any specific musical piece. The participants were not told which pieces included the low-level 17 Hz near-infrasonic tone. The presence of the tone resulted in a significant number (22%) of respondents reporting feeling uneasy or sorrowful, getting chills down the spine or nervous feelings of revulsion or fear.

In presenting the evidence to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Professor Richard Wiseman said &quot;These results suggest that low frequency sound can cause people to have unusual experiences even though they cannot consciously detect infrasound. Some scientists have suggested that this level of sound may be present at some allegedly haunted sites and so cause people to have odd sensations that they attribute to a ghost—our findings support these ideas.&quot;

=== Suggested relationship to ghost sightings ===
Psychologist Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire suggests that the odd sensations that people attribute to ghosts may be caused by infrasonic vibrations. Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University&#x27;s psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called &quot;Ghosts in the Machine&quot; for the &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;. Their research suggested that an infrasonic signal of 19 Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob out of the corner of his eye. When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.

The following day, Tandy was working on his fencing foil, with the handle held in a vice. Although there was nothing touching it, the blade started to vibrate wildly. Further investigation led Tandy to discover that the extractor fan in the lab was emitting a frequency of 18.98 Hz, very close to the resonant frequency of the eye given as 18 Hz by NASA. This, Tandy conjectured, was why he had seen a ghostly figure—it was, he believed, an optical illusion caused by his eyeballs resonating. The room was exactly half a wavelength in length, and the desk was in the centre, thus causing a standing wave which caused the vibration of the foil.

Tandy investigated this phenomenon further and wrote a paper entitled &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot;. He carried out a number of investigations at various sites believed to be haunted, including the basement of the Tourist Information Bureau next to Coventry Cathedral and Edinburgh Castle.

== Detection and measurement ==

NASA Langley has designed and developed an infrasonic detection system that can be used to make useful infrasound measurements at a location where it was not possible previously. The system comprises an electret condenser microphone PCB Model 377M06, having a 3-inch membrane diameter, and a small, compact windscreen. Electret-based technology offers the lowest possible background noise, because Johnson noise generated in the supporting electronics (preamplifier) is minimized.

The microphone features a high membrane compliance with a large backchamber volume, a prepolarized backplane and a high impedance preamplifier located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low acoustic impedance and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability. Close-cell polyurethane foam has been found to serve the purpose well. In the proposed test, test parameters will be sensitivity, background noise, signal fidelity (harmonic distortion), and temporal stability.

The microphone design differs from that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth&#x27;s surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great penetration capability of infrasound through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.

Thus the system fulfills several instrumentation requirements advantageous to the application of acoustics: (1) a low-frequency microphone with especially low background noise, which enables detection of low-level signals within a low-frequency passband; (2) a small, compact windscreen that permits (3) rapid deployment of a microphone array in the field. The system also features a data acquisition system that permits real time detection, bearing, and signature of a low-frequency source.

=== Infrasound for nuclear detonation detection ===
Infrasound is one of several techniques used to identify if a nuclear detonation has occurred. A network of 60 infrasound stations, in addition to seismic and hydroacoustic stations, comprise the International Monitoring System (IMS) that is tasked with monitoring compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). IMS Infrasound stations consist of eight microbarometer sensors and space filters arranged in an array covering an area of approximately 1 to 9 km2. The space filters used are radiating pipes with inlet ports along their length, designed to average out pressure variations like wind turbulence for more precise measurements. The microbarometers used are designed to monitor frequencies below approximately 20 hertz. Sound waves below 20 hertz have longer wavelengths and are not easily absorbed, allowing for detection across large distances.

Infrasound wavelengths can be generated artificially through detonations and other human activity, or naturally from earthquakes, severe weather, lightning, and other sources. Like forensic seismology, algorithms and other filter techniques are required to analyze gathered data and characterize events to determine if a nuclear detonation has actually occurred. Data is transmitted from each station via secure communication links for further analysis. A digital signature is also embedded in the data sent from each station to verify if the data is authentic.

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission uses infrasound as one of its monitoring technologies, along with seismic, hydroacoustic, and atmospheric radionuclide monitoring. The loudest infrasound recorded to date by the monitoring system was generated by the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor.

== In popular culture ==
The 2017 film &quot;The Sound&quot; uses infrasound as a major plot element.

In &quot;Fermata&quot;, a 2020 episode of the Franco-Belgian TV series &quot;Astrid et Raphaëlle&quot;, infrasound from a generator hidden in the pipe organ of the Grand Auditorium in the Maison de la Radio et de la Musique, the Paris headquarters of Radio France, is used as a murder weapon.

The &#x27;ghost frequency&#x27; phenomenon is mentioned in Season 3 Episode 4 of the TV Series Evil, &quot;The Demon of the Road.&quot;

<text>The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) is a multi-arts center in Brooklyn, New York City. It hosts progressive and avant-garde performances, with theater, dance, music, opera, film programming across multiple nearby venues.

BAM was chartered in 1859, presented its first show in 1861, and began operations in its present location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in 1908. The Academy is incorporated as a New York State not-for-profit corporation. It has 501(c)(3) status. Gina Duncan has served as president since April 2022. David Binder became artistic director in 2019.

==History==

===Original facility===
On October 21, 1858, a meeting was held at the Polytechnic Institute to measure support for establishing &quot;a hall adapted to Musical, Literary, Scientific and other occasional purposes, of sufficient size to meet the requirements of our large population and worth in style and appearance of our city.&quot; The group applied to the New York State Legislature for a charter in the name of Brooklyn Academy of Music. The New York Legislature passed the bill to incorporate the Brooklyn Academy of Music on February 16, 1859. The group raised $60,000 by November 22 and another $90,000 by March 16, 1859. The Brooklyn Academy of Music opened on January 15, 1861.

At the inaugural address on the opening, the management announced that no dramatic performance should ever be held within its walls. The first concert opened with the overture to &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, followed by arias and excerpts from various operas, including the &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture which opened part 2 of the concert.

Founded in 1861, the first BAM facility at 176–194 Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights was conceived as the home of the Philharmonic Society of Brooklyn. The building, designed by architect Leopold Eidlitz, housed a large theater seating 2,109, a smaller concert hall, dressing and chorus rooms, and a vast &quot;baronial&quot; kitchen. BAM presented amateur and professional music and theater productions, including performers such as Ellen Terry, Edwin Booth, and Fritz Kreisler. On her lecture tour of the United States in 1889-1890, Egyptologist and founder of the Egypt Exploration Society Amelia Edwards gave her first and last lectures here, in November and March, respectively.

=== Current facilities ===
After the building burned to the ground on November 30, 1903, BAM made plans to relocate to a new facility in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Herts &amp; Tallant designed the new building. The cornerstone was laid at 30 Lafayette Avenue on May 25, 1907. 

A series of opening events were held in November 1908; the first opera to be staged there was the Metropolitan Opera production of &quot;Faust&quot;. It was also used for religious services during the early 1900s, when Charles Taze Russell, founder of the bible students movement (now Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and International Bible Students Association), gave sermons there.

==== 1960s to 1990s ====
The Waltann School of Creative Arts (WSCA), founded in 1959, located at 1078 Park Place, Brooklyn, was a BAM venue during the 1960s and 1970s. One of the dance teachers there was African American contemporary dancer Carole Johnson, and the Eleo Pomare Dance Company performed there in 1967.

In 1967, Harvey Lichtenstein was appointed executive director and during his 32 years in that role, BAM experienced a turnaround, attracting audiences with new programming and establishing an endowment. BAM began hosting the annual Next Wave Festival in 1983, featuring performances by international and American artists. 

The Chelsea Theater Center was in residence from 1967 to 1977.

From 1999 to 2015, Karen Brooks Hopkins was president, and Joseph V. Melillo was executive producer through 2018.

==== 2000s to present ====
30 Lafayette Avenue&#x27;s facade was restored for $8.6 million in 2004.

A regular event was BAMcinemaFest, a festival focusing on independent films. Katy Clark was president from 2015 and left the institution in 2021. 

==People==
Artists who have presented work at BAM include Philip Glass, Trisha Brown, Peter Brook, Pina Bausch, Merce Cunningham, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company, Laurie Anderson, Lee Breuer, ETHEL, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Steve Reich, Seal, Mark Morris, Robert Wilson, Peter Sellars, BLACKstreet, Ingmar Bergman, David Van Tieghem, Michael Moschen, Twyla Tharp, Ralph Lemon, Ivo van Hove, and the Mariinsky Theater, directed and conducted by Valery Gergiev, among others. 

American punk band &quot;Hole&quot; recorded their live album MTV Unplugged at the Academy on February 14, 1995. Alice in Chains also recorded their live album &quot;Unplugged&quot; at the Academy on April 10, 1996 at the Majestic Theater (now the Harvey Theater) for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. Alanis Morissette also recorded her live album &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; at the Academy on September 18, 1999.

==Facilities==

The Peter Jay Sharp Building in the Fort Greene Historic District houses the Howard Gilman Opera House and the BAM Rose Cinemas (formerly the Carey Playhouse). It was designed by the firm Herts &amp; Tallant in 1908, in the renaissance revival style. It is a U-shaped building with an open court in the center of the lot between two theater wings above the first story. The building has a high base of gray granite, with cream colored brick trimmed in terracotta with some marble detail above. The Howard Gilman Opera House has 2,109 seats and BAM Rose Cinemas, which opened in 1998, comprises four screens, and primarily shows first-run, independent and repertory films and series.

Also within the Peter Jay Sharp Building is the Lepercq Space, originally a ballroom and now a flexible event space which houses the BAMcafé, and the Hillman Attic Studio, a flexible rehearsal/performing space.

The BAM Strong, an array of spaces, includes the 874-seat BAM Harvey Theater at 651 Fulton Street. Formerly known as the Majestic Theater, it was built in 1904 with 1,708 seats and eventually showed vaudeville and then feature films, and was named in Lichtenstein&#x27;s honor in 1999. A renovation by architect Hugh Hardy left the interior paint faded, with often exposed masonry, giving the theater a unique feel of a &quot;modern ruin&quot;. In April 2014, CNN named the BAM Harvey as one of the &quot;15 of the World&#x27;s Most Spectacular Theaters&quot;. The complex also features a dedicated art gallery.

The BAM Fisher Building, opened in 2012, contains Fishman Space, a 250-seat black box theater, and Fisher Hillman Studio, a flexible rehearsal and performance space, as well as administrative offices. The BAM Hamm Archives are located off-site in Crown Heights at 1000 Dean St. and maintain the publicly accessible Levy Digital Archive.

The BAM Sharp and Fisher Buildings are located within the Brooklyn Academy of Music Historic District created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1978; the BAM Strong is not. BAM is adjacent to downtown Brooklyn, near Atlantic Terminal, the Barclays Center arena, and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower (once the tallest building in Brooklyn). BAM is part of the Brooklyn Cultural District.

<text>Peter Stephen Paul Brook (21 March 1925 – 2 July 2022) was an English theatre and film director. He worked first in England, from 1945 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, from 1947 at the Royal Opera House, and from 1962 for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). With them, he directed the first English-language production in 1964 of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; by Peter Weiss, which was transferred to Broadway in 1965 and won the Tony Award for Best Play, and Brook was named Best Director. He also directed films such as an iconic version of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; in 1963.

Brook was based in France from the early 1970s, where he founded an international theatre company, playing in developing countries, in an approach of great simplicity. He was often referred to as &quot;our greatest living theatre director&quot;. He won multiple Emmy Awards, a Laurence Olivier Award, the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Prix Italia and the Europe Theatre Prize. In 2021, he was awarded India&#x27;s Padma Shri.

==Early life==
Brook was born on 21 March 1925 in the Bedford Park area of Chiswick, the second son of Simon Brook and his wife Ida (Judelson), both Lithuanian Jewish immigrants from Latvia. The family home was at 27 Fairfax Road, Turnham Green. His elder brother Alexis became a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. His first cousin was Valentin Pluchek, chief director of the Moscow Satire Theatre. Brook was educated at Westminster School, Gresham&#x27;s School, and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied languages until 1945. Brook was excused from military service during World War II due to childhood illness.

==Career==
=== England ===
Brook directed Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Dr Faustus&quot;, his first production, in 1943 at the Torch Theatre in London, followed at the Chanticleer Theatre in 1945 with a revival of Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Infernal Machine&quot;. He was engaged from 1945 as stage director at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (BRT). Hired by BRT director Barry Jackson when he was just twenty years old, Jackson described Brook as &quot;the youngest earthquake I&#x27;ve known&quot;.

In 1946, Brook went to Stratford-upon-Avon to direct &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; for the Stratford-Upon-Avon Festival Company at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, returning in 1947 to direct &quot;Romeo and Juliet &quot;. From 1947 to 1950, he was Director of Productions at the Royal Opera House in London. His work there included an effective re-staging of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; using sets dating from 1899, in 1948, and a highly controversial staging of &quot;Salome&quot; by Richard Strauss with sets by Salvador Dalí in 1949. A proliferation of stage and screen work as producer and director followed. Howard Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; at the Ambassadors Theatre, London, in 1949 was an early, much admired production. From 1962, he was director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), together with Peter Hall. With them, he directed the first English-language production in 1964 of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; by the German playwright Peter Weiss. It transferred to Broadway in 1965 and won the Tony Award for Best Play, and Brook was named Best Director. In 1966, they presented &quot;US&quot;, an anti-Vietnam War protest play.

====Influences====
Brook was influenced by the work of Antonin Artaud and his ideas for his Theatre of Cruelty.

In England, Peter Brook and Charles Marowitz undertook The Theatre of Cruelty Season (1964) at the Royal Shakespeare Company, aiming to explore ways in which Artaud&#x27;s ideas could be used to find new forms of expression and retrain the performer. The result was a showing of &#x27;works in progress&#x27; made up of improvisations and sketches, one of which was the premier of Artaud&#x27;s &quot;The Spurt of Blood&quot;.
:– Lee Jamieson, &quot;Antonin Artaud: From Theory to Practice&quot;, Greenwich Exchange, 2007

His greatest influence, however, was Joan Littlewood. Brook described her as &quot;the most galvanising director in mid-20th century Britain&quot;. Brook&#x27;s work was also inspired by the theories of experimental theatre of Jerzy Grotowski, Bertolt Brecht, Chris Covics and Vsevolod Meyerhold and by the works of Edward Gordon Craig, and Matila Ghyka.

Brook considered G. I. Gurdjieff, his spiritual master, but was guarded about Gurdjieff&#x27;s influence:

&quot;This is something so rich that nothing would be more harmful than trying to encapsulate it in a few easy phrases.&quot; - Peter Brook

====Collaborators====
Brook collaborated with actors Paul Scofield as Lear, John Gielgud in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and Glenda Jackson; designers Georges Wakhévitch and Sally Jacobs; and writers Ted Hughes and William Golding. Brook first encountered Wakhévitch in London when he saw the production of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s ballet &quot;Le Jeune Homme et la Mort&quot; which Wakhévitch designed. Brook declared that he &quot;was convinced that this was the designer for whom I had been waiting&quot;.

===International Centre for Theatre Research===

In 1971, with Micheline Rozan, Brook founded the International Centre for Theatre Research, a multinational company of actors, dancers, musicians and others, which travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s. It has been based in Paris at the Bouffes du Nord theatre since 1974. The troupe played at immigrant hostels, in villages and in refugee camps, sometimes for people who had never been exposed to theatre. In 2008 he resigned as its artistic director, beginning a three-year handover to Olivier Mantei and .

====&quot;The Mahabharata&quot;====

In the mid-1970s, Brook, with writer Jean-Claude Carrière, began work on adapting the Indian epic poem the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; into a stage play, which was first performed in 1985 and later developed into a televised mini series.

In a long article in 1985, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted &quot;overwhelming critical acclaim&quot;, and that the play &quot;did nothing less than attempt to transform Hindu myth into universalized art, accessible to any culture&quot;. However, many post-colonial scholars have challenged the claim to universalism, accusing the play of orientalism. Gautam Dasgupta wrote that &quot;Brook&#x27;s &quot;Mahabharata&quot; falls short of the essential Indianness of the epic by staging predominantly its major incidents and failing to adequately emphasize its coterminous philosophical precepts.&quot;

In 2015, Brook returned to the world of &quot;The Mahabharata&quot; with a new Young Vic production, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, in collaboration with Jean-Claude Carrière and Marie-Hélène Estienne.

====&quot;Tierno Bokar&quot;====
In 2005, Brook directed &quot;Tierno Bokar&quot;, based on the life of the Malian sufi of the same name. The play was adapted for the stage by Marie-Hélène Estienne from a book by Amadou Hampâté Bâ (translated into English as &quot;A Spirit of Tolerance: The Inspiring Life of Tierno Bokar&quot;). The book and play detail Bokar&#x27;s life and message of religious tolerance. Columbia University produced 44 related events, lectures, and workshops that were attended by over 3,200 people throughout the run of &quot;Tierno Bokar&quot;. Panel discussions focused on topics of religious tolerance and Muslim tradition in West Africa.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Brook married actress Natasha Parry. They had two children: Irina, an actress and director, and Simon, a director. Parry died of a stroke in July 2015, aged 84.

Brook died in Paris on 2 July 2022, aged 97.

==Work==
Sources for Brook&#x27;s productions are held by the Academy of Arts in Berlin, the Princess of Asturias Foundation, and others.

=== Shakespeare ===
Brook was fascinated with the works of Shakespeare which he produced in England and elsewhere, in films, and adaptation. In 1945, he began with &quot;King John&quot;, with designer Paul Shelving at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, he directed &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; in 1950 and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; in 1952, both with John Gielgud, followed there by &quot;Hamlet Prince of Denmark&quot; in 1955, with Paul Scofield (Hamlet), Alec Clunes (Claudius), Diana Wynyard (Gertrude), Mary Ure (Ophelia), Ernest Thesiger (Polonius), Richard Johnson (Laertes), Michael David (Horatio), and Richard Pasco (Fortinbras). &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, was played there the same year, and also on a European tour in 1957.

Brooks&#x27;s 1953 staging of &quot;King Lear&quot;, for the American TV show &quot;Omnibus&quot;, starred Orson Welles in Welles&#x27;s first-ever television production.

His first work for the Royal Shakespeare Company was in 1962 &quot;King Lear&quot;, with Paul Scofield. He created a legendary version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, with designer Sally Jacobs (designer), John Kane (Puck), Frances de la Tour (Helena), Ben Kingsley (Demetrius) and Patrick Stewart (Snout) in 1970. He directed the film &quot;King Lear&quot;, again with Scofield, in 1971.

He kept producing works by Shakespeare for the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, in French, including &quot;Timon d&#x27;Athènes&quot;, adaptated by Jean-Claude Carrière, 1974, &quot;Mesure pour mesure&quot; in 1978 and as a film a year later, &quot;La Tempête&quot;, adaptated by Carrière, with Sotigui Kouyaté in 1990.

He directed &quot;The Tragedy of Hamlet&quot;, with Adrian Lester (Hamlet), Jeffery Kissoon (Claudius / Ghost), Natasha Parry (Gertrude), Shantala Shivalingappa (Ophelia), Bruce Myers (Polonius), Rohan Siva (Laertes / Guildenstern), Scott Handy (Horatio) and Yoshi Oida (Player King / Rosencrantz) in 2000, followed by a TV film version in 2002. In 2009, he directed a theatrical version of sonnets, &quot;Love is my Sin&quot;. In 2010, Shakespeare was among the authors for the production &quot;Warum warum&quot; (&quot;Why Why&quot;), written by Brook and Marie-Hélène Estienne after also Antonin Artaud, Edward Gordon Craig, Charles Dullin, Vsevolod Meyerhold and Zeami Motokiyo.

== Europe Theatre Prize ==
In 1989 he was awarded the II Europe Theatre Prize in Taormina, with the following motivation:In the field of world theatre of the second half of our century, the long theoretical and practical work of Peter Brook has – without any doubt – unrivalled merits, which are – broadly speaking – unique. Brook&#x27;s first merit is that of having always pursued an authentic research outside the sterile &#x27;routine&#x27; of what he has defined as &#x27;Deadly Theatre&#x27;. Brook&#x27;s second merit is that of having been able to use different languages of contemporary scene; in the same way he has been able to unify the variety of languages. Brook&#x27;s third merit is that of having discovered and given back a bright vitality to some great cultural and theatrical heritages which hitherto had remained distant from us both in space and time. Nevertheless – without any doubt – Brook&#x27;s noblest and most constant merit is that of having never separated the strictness and finesse of research from the necessity that the result of those ones would have had the audience as their receiver and interlocutor; the audience which is also requested to renew its habits.

<text>The Galata Tower (), officially the Galata Tower Museum (), is a medieval Genoese tower in the Galata part of the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul, Turkey. Built as a watchtower at the highest point of the mostly demolished Walls of Galata, the tower is now an exhibition space and museum, and a symbol of Beyoğlu and Istanbul.

==History==
During the Byzantine period the Emperor Justinian had a tower erected in what was to become Galata. This tower was destroyed by the Crusaders during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. 

In 1267 a Genoese colony was established in the Galata part of Constantinople. It was surrounded by walls and the Galata Tower was first built at their highest point as the &quot;Christea Turris&quot; (Tower of Christ) in Romanesque style in 1348 during an expansion of the colony. At the time the Galata Tower, at , was the tallest building in the city.

After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Genoese colony was abolished and most of the walls of the citadel were later pulled down in the 19th century, during the northward expansion of the city in the districts of Beyoğlu and Beşiktaş; though small parts of the Genoese walls in Galata have survived. The tower was allowed to survive and was turned into a prison. It was from its roof that, in 1638, Hezarfen Ahmed Çelebi supposedly strapped on wings and made the first intercontinental flight, landing in the Doğancılar Meydanı in Üsküdar on the Asian side of the city, a story of doubtful authenticity recounted by the Ottoman travel writer, Evliya Çelebi. 

From 1717, the Ottomans used the tower to look out for fires (on the Old Istanbul side of the city the Beyazıt Tower served the same function). In 1794, during the reign of Sultan Selim III, the roof was reinforced in lead and wood, but the stairs were severely damaged by a fire. Another fire damaged the building in 1831, after which further restoration work took place.

In 1875, the tower&#x27;s conical roof was destroyed during a storm. It remained without this roof for the rest of the Ottoman period but, many years later, during restoration work between 1965 and 1967, the conical roof was reconstructed. At the same time the tower&#x27;s wooden interior was replaced with a concrete structure and it was opened to the public.

In 2020 the Tower was splendidly restored then reopened as a museum now open for the public and the many tourists visiting Istanbul. 

It is mainly popular for the 360-degree view of Istanbul visible from its observation deck. 


==Dimensions==
The nine-story tower is tall, excluding the ornament on the top. The observation deck is at . The tower is above sea-level. It has an external diameter of at the base, an inside diameter of , and walls that are thick.

<text>Marie Josephine Hull (née Sherwood; January 3, 1877 – March 12, 1957) was an American stage and film actress who also was a director of plays. She had a successful 50-year career on stage while taking some of her better known roles to film. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the movie &quot;Harvey&quot; (1950), a role she originally played on the Broadway stage. She was sometimes credited as Josephine Sherwood.

==Background==
Hull was born January 3, 1877, in Newtonville, Massachusetts, one of four children born to William H. Sherwood and Mary Elizabeth &quot;Minnie&quot; Tewkesbury, but would later shave years off her age.

==Career==

===Stage===
Hull made her stage debut in 1905, and after some years as a chorus girl and touring stock player, she married actor Shelley Hull (the elder brother of actor Henry Hull) in 1910. After her husband&#x27;s death as a young man, the actress retired until 1923, when she returned to acting using her married name, Josephine Hull. The couple had no children. 

She had her first major stage success in George Kelly&#x27;s Pulitzer-winning &quot;Craig&#x27;s Wife&quot; in 1926. Kelly wrote a role especially for her in his next play, &quot;Daisy Mayme&quot;, which also was staged in 1926. She continued working in New York theater throughout the 1920s. In the 1930s and 1940s, Hull appeared in three Broadway hits, as a batty matriarch in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1936), as a homicidal old lady in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1941), and in &quot;Harvey&quot; (1944). The plays all had long runs, and took up ten years of Hull&#x27;s career. Her last Broadway play, &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot; (1954–55), was later made into a film version with the much younger Judy Holliday in the role.

===Film===
Hull made only seven films, beginning in 1927 with a small part in the Clara Bow feature &quot;Get Your Man&quot;, followed by &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot; in 1929. That was followed by two 1932 Fox features, &quot;After Tomorrow&quot; (recreating her stage role) and &quot;Careless Lady&quot;. 

She missed out on recreating her &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; role in 1938, as she was still onstage with the show. Instead, Spring Byington appeared in the film version.

Hull played Aunt Abby who, along with Jean Adair as Aunt Martha, was one of the two Brewster sisters in the film version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944) starring Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane.

Hull then appeared in the screen version of &quot;Harvey&quot; (1950), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. &quot;Variety&quot; credited Hull&#x27;s performance: &quot;the slightly balmy aunt (actually playing “Elwood&#x27;s” sister, “Veta”) who wants to have Elwood committed, is immense, socking the comedy for every bit of its worth&quot;.

After &quot;Harvey&quot;, Hull made only one more film, &quot;The Lady from Texas&quot; (1951); she had also appeared in the CBS-TV version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; in 1949, with Ruth McDevitt, an actress who often succeeded Hull in her Broadway roles, as her sister.

==Death==
Hull died on March 12, 1957, aged 80, from a cerebral hemorrhage.

<doc id="215196" wikidata="Q3153" url="?curid=215196" title="John Surtees">
<text>John Norman Surtees (11 February 1934 – 10 March 2017) was a British racing driver and motorcycle road racer, who competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing from to , and Formula One from to . Surtees was a seven-time Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion, with four titles in the premier 500cc class with MV Agusta. Surtees won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and remains the only driver to win World Championships on both two- and four-wheels; he won 38 motorcycle Grands Prix and six Formula One Grands Prix.

On his way to become a seven-time Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion, he won his first title in 1956, and followed with three consecutive doubles between 1958 and 1960, winning six World Championships in both the 500 and 350cc classes. Surtees then made the move to the pinnacle of four-wheeled motorsport, the Formula One World Championship, and in 1964 made motor racing history by becoming the Formula One World Champion. He founded the Surtees Racing Organisation team that competed as a constructor in Formula One, Formula 2 and Formula 5000 from 1970 to 1978. He was also the ambassador of the Racing Steps Foundation.

==Motorcycle racing career==
Surtees was the son of a south-London motorcycle dealer. His father Jack Surtees was an accomplished grasstrack competitor and in 1948 was the South Eastern Centre Sidecar Champion. He had his first professional outing, which they won, in the sidecar of his father&#x27;s Vincent at the age of 14. However, when race officials discovered Surtees&#x27;s age, they were disqualified. He entered his first race at 15 in a grasstrack competition. In 1950, at the age of 16, he went to work for the Vincent factory as an apprentice. He first gained prominence in 1951 when he gave Norton star Geoff Duke a strong challenge in an ACU race at the Thruxton Circuit.

In 1955, Norton race chief Joe Craig gave Surtees his first factory-sponsored ride aboard the Nortons. He finished the year by beating reigning world champion Duke at Silverstone and then at Brands Hatch. However, with Norton in financial trouble and uncertain about their racing plans, Surtees accepted an offer to race for the MV Agusta factory racing team, where he soon earned the nickname &quot;figlio del vento&quot; (son of the wind).

In 1956 Surtees won the 500 cc world championship, MV Agusta&#x27;s first in the senior class. In this Surtees was assisted by the FIM&#x27;s decision to ban the defending champion, Geoff Duke, for six months because of his support for a riders&#x27; strike for more starting money. In the 1957 season, the MV Agustas were no match for the Gileras and Surtees battled to a third-place finish aboard a 1957 MV Agusta 500 Quattro.

When Gilera and Moto Guzzi withdrew from Grand Prix racing at the end of 1957, Surtees and MV Agusta went on to dominate the competition in the two larger displacement classes. In 1958, 1959 and 1960, he won 32 out of 39 races and became the first man to win the Senior TT at the Isle of Man TT three years in succession.

==Auto racing career==

While still racing motorcycles full-time, Surtees performed a test drive in Aston Martin&#x27;s DBR1 sports car in front of team manager Reg Parnell. He however continued on two wheels and did not enter car racing until the following year.

In 1960, at the age of 26, Surtees switched from motorcycles to cars full-time, making his Formula 1 debut racing in the 1960 BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone for Team Lotus. He made an immediate impact with a second-place finish in only his second Formula One World Championship race, at the 1960 British Grand Prix, and a pole position at his third, the 1960 Portuguese Grand Prix.

After spending the 1961 season with the Yeoman Credit Racing Team driving a Cooper T53 &quot;Lowline&quot; managed by Reg Parnell and the 1962 season with the Bowmaker Racing Team, still managed by Reg Parnell but now in the V8 Lola Mk4, he moved to Scuderia Ferrari in 1963 and won the World Championship for the Italian team in 1964.

On 25 September 1965, Surtees had a life-threatening accident at the Mosport Park Circuit (Ontario, Canada) while practising in a Lola T70 sports racing car. A front upright casting had broken. A.J. Baime in his book &quot;Go Like Hell&quot; says Surtees came out of the crash with one side of his body four inches shorter than the other. Doctors set most of the breaks nonsurgically, in part by physically stretching his shattered body until the right-left discrepancy was under an inch – and there it stayed.

The 1966 season saw the introduction of new, larger 3-litre engines to Formula One. Surtees&#x27;s debut with Ferrari&#x27;s new F1 car was at the 1966 BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, where he qualified and finished a close second behind Jack Brabham&#x27;s 3-litre Brabham BT19. A few weeks later, Surtees led the Monaco Grand Prix, pulling away from Jackie Stewart&#x27;s 2-litre BRM on the straights, before the engine failed. A fortnight later Surtees survived the first lap rainstorm which eliminated half the field and won the Belgian Grand Prix.

Due to perennial strikes in Italy, Ferrari could afford to enter only two cars (Ferrari P3s) for the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans instead of its usual entry of three prototypes. Uncertainty and confusion surrounds subsequent events and their consequences, and a number of different explanations have been offered in the decades since. The narrative explained by Ferrari at the time states that under Le Mans rules in 1966 each car was allowed only two drivers. Surtees was omitted from the driver line-up with one works Ferrari to be driven by Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti, and the other by Jean Guichet and Lorenzo Bandini. When Surtees questioned Ferrari team manager Eugenio Dragoni as to why, as the Ferrari team leader, he would not be allowed to compete, Dragoni told Surtees that he did not feel that he was fully fit to drive in a 24-hour endurance race because of the injuries he had sustained in late 1965. However, Surtees himself described things somewhat differently. In his recollection, when the pairings were announced he was to drive alongside Scarfiotti. As the faster driver of the two, Surtees argued that he should take the first stint and &quot;try to break&quot; the Ford opposition by driving &quot;flat out from the start&quot;. Dragoni denied Surtees&#x27;s request and insisted that Scarfiotti take the start, supposedly to please Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli, Scarfiotti&#x27;s uncle, who was in attendance as a spectator. Either way, the decision and subsequent lack of support from Enzo Ferrari were deeply upsetting to Surtees and he immediately quit the team. This decision likely cost both Ferrari and Surtees the Formula 1 Championship in 1966. Ferrari finished second to Brabham-Repco in the Constructors&#x27; Championship and Surtees finished second to Jack Brabham in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Surtees finished the season driving for the Cooper-Maserati team, winning the last race of the season.

Surtees competed with a T70 in the inaugural 1966 Can-Am season, winning three races of six to become champion over other winners Dan Gurney (Lola), Mark Donohue (Lola) and Phil Hill (Chaparral) as well as the likes of Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon (both in McLarens).

In December 1966, Surtees signed for Honda. After a promising third place in the first race in South Africa, the Honda RA273 hit a series of mechanical problems. The car was replaced by the Honda RA300 for the Italian Grand Prix, where Surtees slipstreamed Jack Brabham to take Honda&#x27;s second F1 victory by 0.2 seconds. Surtees finished fourth in the 1967 Drivers&#x27; Championship.

The same year, Surtees drove in the &quot;Rex Mays 300&quot; at Riverside, near Los Angeles, in a United States Auto Club season-ending road race. This event pitted the best American drivers of the day – normally those who had cut their teeth as professional drivers on oval dirt tracks – against veteran Formula One Grand Prix drivers, including Jim Clark and Dan Gurney.

In 1970, Surtees formed his own race team, the Surtees Racing Organisation, and spent nine seasons competing in Formula 5000, Formula 2 and Formula 1 as a constructor. He retired from competitive driving in 1972, the same year the team had their greatest success when Mike Hailwood won the European Formula 2 Championship. The team was finally disbanded at the end of 1978.

==After Formula One==

For a while in the 1970s Surtees ran a motorcycle shop in West Wickham, Kent, and a Honda car dealership in Edenbridge, Kent. He continued his involvement in motorcycling, participating in classic events with bikes from his stable of vintage racing machines. He also remained involved in single-seater racing cars and held the position of chairman of A1 Team Great Britain, in the A1 Grand Prix racing series from 2005 to 2007. His son, Henry Surtees, competed in the FIA Formula 2 Championship, Formula Renault UK Championship and the Formula BMW UK championship for Carlin Motorsport, before he died while racing in the Formula 2 championship at Brands Hatch on 19 July 2009. In 2010, Surtees founded the Henry Surtees Foundation in his son&#x27;s memory, as a charitable organization to assist victims of accidental brain injuries and to promote safety in driving and motorsport.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

In 1996, Surtees was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. The FIM honoured him as a Grand Prix &quot;Legend&quot; in 2003. Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to motorsport.

In 2013 he was awarded the 2012 Segrave Trophy in recognition of multiple world championships, and being the only person to win world titles on 2 and 4 wheels.

In 2015, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering by Oxford Brookes University.

==Personal life and death==
Surtees married three times, first to Patricia Burke in 1962; the couple divorced in 1979. His second wife was Janis Sheara, whom he married in 1979 and they divorced in 1982. Jane Sparrow was his third wife, whom he married in 1987, and with whom he had three children, including Henry. Henry would later become a racing driver, but was killed at Brands Hatch in the 2009 FIA Formula Two Championship.

Surtees died of respiratory failure on 10 March 2017 at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London, at the age of 83. He was buried, next to his son Henry, at St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church in Lingfield, Surrey.

A tribute to Surtees was held at the Goodwood Members Meeting on 19 March 2017.
