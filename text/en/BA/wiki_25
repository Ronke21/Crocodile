<text>Pascal&#x27;s wager is a philosophical argument advanced by Blaise Pascal (1623–1662), seventeenth-century French mathematician, philosopher, physicist, and theologian. This argument posits that individuals essentially engage in a life-defining gamble regarding the belief in the existence of God.

Pascal contends that a rational person should adopt a lifestyle consistent with the existence of God and actively strive to believe in God. The reasoning behind this stance lies in the potential outcomes: if God does not exist, the individual incurs only finite losses, potentially sacrificing certain pleasures and luxuries. However, if God does indeed exist, they stand to gain immeasurably, as represented for example by an eternity in Heaven in Abrahamic tradition, while simultaneously avoiding boundless losses associated with an eternity in Hell.

The original articulation of this wager can be found in Pascal&#x27;s posthumously published work titled &quot;Pensées&quot; (&quot;Thoughts&quot;), which comprises a compilation of previously unpublished notes. Notably, Pascal&#x27;s wager is significant as it marks the initial formal application of decision theory, existentialism, pragmatism, and voluntarism.

Critics of the wager question the ability to provide definitive proof of God&#x27;s existence. The argument from inconsistent revelations highlights the presence of various belief systems, each claiming exclusive access to divine truths. Additionally, the argument from inauthentic belief raises concerns about the genuineness of faith in God if solely motivated by potential benefits and losses.

== The wager ==
The wager uses the following logic (excerpts from &quot;Pensées&quot;, part III, §233):

* God is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives
* A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up
* You must wager; it is not optional
* Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing
* Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
* But some cannot believe. They should then &#x27;at least learn your inability to believe...&#x27; and &#x27;Endeavour then to convince&#x27; themselves.

Pascal asks the reader to analyze humankind&#x27;s position, where our actions can be enormously consequential, but our understanding of those consequences is flawed. While we can discern a great deal through reason, we are ultimately forced to gamble. Pascal cites a number of distinct areas of uncertainty in human life:

Pascal describes humanity as a finite being trapped within divine incomprehensibility, briefly thrust into being from non-being, with no explanation of &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;What?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot; On Pascal&#x27;s view, human finitude constrains our ability to achieve truth reliably.

Given that reason alone cannot determine whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions as a coin toss. However, even if we do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the consequence. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.

In Pascal&#x27;s assessment, participation in this wager is not optional. Merely by existing in a state of uncertainty, we are forced to choose between the available courses of action for practical purposes.

== Pascal&#x27;s description of the wager ==

The &quot;Pensées&quot; passage on Pascal&#x27;s wager is as follows:

Pascal begins by painting a situation where both the existence and non-existence of God are impossible to prove by human reason. So, supposing that reason cannot determine the truth between the two options, one must &quot;wager&quot; by weighing the possible consequences. Pascal&#x27;s assumption is that, when it comes to making the decision, no one can refuse to participate; withholding assent is impossible because we are already &quot;embarked&quot;, effectively living out the choice.

We only have two things to stake, our &quot;reason&quot; and our &quot;happiness&quot;. Pascal considers that if there is &quot;&quot;equal&quot; risk of loss and gain&quot; (i.e. a coin toss), then human reason is powerless to address the question of whether God exists. That being the case, then human reason can only decide the question according to possible resulting happiness of the decision, weighing the gain and loss in believing that God exists and likewise in believing that God does not exist.

He points out that if a wager were between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of happiness and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it were three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness for the possibility of gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since &quot;If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing&quot;, meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or miss the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, &quot;It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable...&quot;

=== Inability to believe ===

Pascal addressed the difficulty that reason and rationality pose to genuine belief by proposing that &quot;acting as if [one] believed&quot; could &quot;cure [one] of unbelief&quot;:

=== Analysis with decision theory ===

The possibilities defined by Pascal&#x27;s wager can be thought of as a decision under uncertainty with the values of the following decision matrix.

Given these values, the option of living as if God exists (B) dominates the option of living as if God does not exist (¬B), as long as one assumes a positive probability that God exists. In other words, the expected value gained by choosing B is greater than or equal to that of choosing ¬B.

In fact, according to decision theory, the only value that matters in the above matrix is the +∞ (infinitely positive). Any matrix of the following type (where f1, f2, and f3 are all negative or finite positive numbers) results in (B) as being the only rational decision.

=== Misunderstanding of the wager ===

Pascal&#x27;s intent was not to provide an argument to convince atheists to believe, but (a) to show the fallacy of attempting to use logical reasoning to prove or disprove God, and (b) to persuade atheists to sinlessness, as an aid to attaining faith (&quot;it is this which will lessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks&quot;). As Laurent Thirouin writes (note that the numbering of the items in the &quot;Pensees&quot; is not standardized; Thirouin&#x27;s 418 is this article&#x27;s 233):

To be put at the beginning of Pascal&#x27;s planned book, the wager was meant to show that logical reasoning cannot support faith or lack thereof:

Frederick Copleston writes that Pascal did not intend the wager as proof of God&#x27;s existence or even a substitute for such proofs. He argues that the wager must be understood in the context of Pascal addressing the wager to those who &quot;though they are also unconvinced by the arguments of sceptics and atheists&quot; also &quot;remain in a state of suspended judgment&quot;. Pascal&#x27;s aim was to prepare &quot;their minds and the production of dispositions favourable to belief&quot;.

== Criticism ==

Criticism of Pascal&#x27;s wager began soon after it was published. Non-believers questioned the &quot;benefits&quot; of a deity whose &quot;realm&quot; is beyond reason and the religiously orthodox, who primarily took issue with the wager&#x27;s deistic and agnostic language. Believers criticized it for not proving God&#x27;s existence, the encouragement of false belief, and the problem of which religion and which God should be worshipped. 

=== Laplace ===

The probabilist mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace ridiculed the use of probability in theology, believing that even following Pascal&#x27;s reasoning, it is not worth making a bet, for the hope of profit – equal to the product of the value of the testimonies (infinitely small) and the value of the happiness they promise (which is significant but finite) – must necessarily be infinitely small.

=== Failure to prove the existence of God ===

Voltaire (another prominent French writer of the age of Enlightenment), a generation after Pascal, regarded the idea of the wager as a &quot;proof of God&quot; as &quot;indecent and childish&quot;, adding, &quot;the interest I have to believe a thing is no proof that such a thing exists&quot;. Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God&#x27;s existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is &quot;impossible to avoid&quot; for any living person. He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that &quot;reason is incapable of divining the truth&quot;; thus, a decision of whether to believe in the existence of God must be made by &quot;considering the consequences of each possibility&quot;.

Voltaire&#x27;s critique concerns not the nature of the Pascalian wager as proof of God&#x27;s existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire hints at the fact that Pascal, as a Jansenist, believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.

Voltaire explained that no matter how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief. Pascal, in his &quot;Pensées&quot;, agrees with this, not stating that people can choose to believe (and therefore make a safe wager), but rather that some cannot believe.

As Étienne Souriau explained, in order to accept Pascal&#x27;s argument, the bettor needs to be certain that God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal&#x27;s bettor is here like the fool who seeing a leaf floating on a river&#x27;s waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: &quot;I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path.&quot; And, effectively, the leaf passed on the left side of the stone, but unfortunately for the fool Rothschild never said &quot;I [will take that] bet&quot;.

=== Argument from inconsistent revelations ===
Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the wager, in an argumentation known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in &quot;the wrong god&quot; and would eliminate the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his wager. Denis Diderot, a contemporary of Voltaire, expressed this opinion when asked about the wager, saying &quot;an Imam could reason the same way&quot;. J. L. Mackie writes that &quot;the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshipers of Kali or of Odin.&quot;

Pascal considers this type of objection briefly in the notes compiled into the &quot;Pensées&quot;, and dismisses it:

Pascal says that the skepticism of unbelievers who rest content with the many-religions objection has seduced them into a fatal &quot;repose&quot;. If they were really bent on knowing the truth, they would be persuaded to examine &quot;in detail&quot; whether Christianity is like any other religion, but they just cannot be bothered. Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some &quot;question in philosophy&quot;, but not &quot;here, where everything is at stake&quot;. In &quot;a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned&quot;, they can manage no better than &quot;a superficial reflection&quot; (&quot;une reflexion légère&quot;) and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a leading question, they go off to amuse themselves.

As Pascal scholars observe, Pascal regarded the many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a &quot;trap&quot; that he had no intention of falling into.

David Wetsel notes that Pascal&#x27;s treatment of the pagan religions is brisk: &quot;As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest &#x27;les gens habiles&#x27; (&#x27;clever men&#x27;) Islam warrants more attention, being distinguished from paganism (which for Pascal presumably includes all the other non-Christian religions) by its claim to be a revealed religion. Nevertheless, Pascal concludes that the religion founded by Mohammed can on several counts be shown to be devoid of divine authority, and that therefore, as a path to the knowledge of God, it is as much a dead end as paganism.&quot; Judaism, in view of its close links to Christianity, he deals with elsewhere.

The many-religions objection is taken more seriously by some later apologists of the wager, who argue that of the rival options only those awarding infinite happiness affect the wager&#x27;s dominance. In the opinion of these apologists &quot;finite, semi-blissful promises such as Kali&#x27;s or Odin&#x27;s&quot; therefore drop out of consideration. Also, the infinite bliss that the rival conception of God offers has to be mutually exclusive. If Christ&#x27;s promise of bliss can be attained concurrently with Jehovah&#x27;s and Allah&#x27;s (all three being identified as the God of Abraham), there is no conflict in the decision matrix in the case where the cost of believing in the wrong conception of God is neutral (limbo/purgatory/spiritual death), although this would be countered with an infinite cost in the case where not believing in the correct conception of God results in punishment (hell).

Ecumenical interpretations of the wager argues that it could even be suggested that believing in a generic God, or a god by the wrong name, is acceptable so long as that conception of God has similar essential characteristics of the conception of God considered in Pascal&#x27;s wager (perhaps the God of Aristotle). Proponents of this line of reasoning suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of &quot;genuine options&quot;, or that if Pascal&#x27;s wager can simply bring a person to believe in &quot;generic theism&quot;, it has done its job.

Pascal argues implicitly for the uniqueness of Christianity in the wager itself, writing: &quot;If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible...Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason?&quot;

=== Argument from inauthentic belief ===

Some critics argue that Pascal&#x27;s wager, for those who cannot believe, suggests feigning belief to gain eternal reward. Richard Dawkins argues that this would be dishonest and immoral and that, in addition to this, it is absurd to think that God, being just and omniscient, would not see through this deceptive strategy on the part of the &quot;believer&quot;, thus nullifying the benefits of the wager. William James in his &#x27;Will to Believe&#x27; states that &quot;We feel that a faith in masses and holy water adopted wilfully after such a mechanical calculation would lack the inner soul of faith&#x27;s reality; and if we were ourselves in the place of the Deity, we should probably take particular pleasure in cutting off believers of this pattern from their infinite reward. It is evident that unless there be some pre-existing tendency to believe in masses and holy water, the option offered to the will by Pascal is not a living option&quot;.

Since these criticisms are concerned not with the validity of the wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find themself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal&#x27;s subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God&#x27;s existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes them a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, &quot;I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?&quot; Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: &quot;God looks only at what is inward.&quot; For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the wager but cannot seem to put their heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.

Explicitly addressing the question of inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: &quot;your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [believe] and yet you cannot, [comes] from your passions.&quot; This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: &quot;Learn from those who were bound like you. . . . Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—&#x27;But this is what I am afraid of.&#x27;—And why? What have you to lose?&quot;

An uncontroversial doctrine in both Roman Catholic and Protestant theology is that mere belief in God is insufficient to attain salvation, the standard cite being James 2:19 (KJV): &quot;Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.&quot; Salvation requires &quot;faith&quot; not just in the sense of belief, but of trust and obedience. Pascal and his sister, a nun, were among the leaders of Roman Catholicism&#x27;s Jansenist school of thought whose doctrine of salvation was close to Protestantism in emphasizing faith over works. Both Jansenists and Protestants followed St. Augustine in this emphasis (Martin Luther belonged to the Augustinian Order of monks). Augustine wrote

Since Pascal&#x27;s position was that &quot;saving&quot; belief in God required more than logical assent, accepting the wager could only be a first step. Hence his advice on what steps one could take to arrive at belief.

Some other critics have objected to Pascal&#x27;s wager on the grounds that he wrongly assumes what type of epistemic character God would likely value in his rational creatures if he existed.


== Earlier versions and other wager arguments ==

* The sophist Protagoras had an agnostic position regarding the gods, but he nevertheless continued to worship the gods. This could be considered as an early version of the Wager.
* In the famous tragedy of Euripides &quot;Bacchae&quot;, Kadmos states an early version of Pascal&#x27;s wager. It is noteworthy that at the end of the tragedy Dionysos, the god to whom Kadmos referred, appears and punishes him for thinking in this way. Euripides, quite clearly, considered and dismissed the wager in this tragedy.
* The stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius expressed a similar sentiment in the second book of &quot;Meditations&quot;, saying &quot;Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of Providence?&quot;
* The early Buddhist texts contain passages which defend a Buddhist wager argument for believing in an afterlife.
* In the Sanskrit classic &quot;Sārasamuccaya&quot;, Vararuci makes a similar argument to Pascal&#x27;s wager.
* Muslim Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq is recorded to have postulated variations of the wager on several occasions in different forms, including his famed &#x27;Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit.&#x27; In the Shi&#x27;i hadith book al-Kafi, al-Sadiq declares to an atheist &quot;If what you say is correct – and it is not – then we will both succeed. But if what I say is correct – and it is – then I will succeed, and you will be destroyed.&quot;
* An instantiation of this argument, within the Islamic &quot;kalam&quot; tradition, was discussed by Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni (d. 478/1085) in his &quot;Kitab al-irshad ila-qawati al-adilla fi usul al-i&#x27;tiqad&quot;, or &quot;A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief&quot;. 
* The Christian apologist Arnobius of Sicca (d. 330) stated an early version of the argument in his book &quot;Against the Pagans&quot;, arguing &quot;is it not more rational, of two things uncertain and hanging in doubtful suspense, rather to believe that which carries with it some hopes, than that which brings none at all?&quot;
* A close parallel just before Pascal&#x27;s time occurred in the Jesuit Antoine Sirmond&#x27;s &quot;On the Immortality of the Soul&quot; (1635), which explicitly compared the choice of religion to playing dice and argued &quot;However long and happy the space of this life may be, while ever you place it in the other pan of the balance against a blessed and flourishing eternity, surely it will seem to you ... that the pan will rise on high.&quot;
* The Atheist&#x27;s Wager, popularised by the philosopher Michael Martin and published in his 1990 book &quot;Atheism: A Philosophical Justification&quot;, is an atheistic wager argument in response to Pascal&#x27;s wager.
* A 2008 philosophy book, &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot;, presents a secular revision of Pascal&#x27;s wager: &quot;What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything... Thus, we should seek value.&quot;
* Pascal&#x27;s mugging, a dialogue written by philosopher Nick Bostrom, shows that a rational victim can be made to give up his wallet in exchange for a weakly credible promise of astronomical repayment. As in Pascal&#x27;s Wager, a small but certain downside is outweighed by a large but unlikely upside.
* Roko&#x27;s basilisk is a hypothetical future superintelligence that punishes everyone who failed to help bring it into existence.
* In a 2014 article, philosopher Justin McBrayer argued we ought to remain agnostic about the existence of God but nonetheless believe because of the good that comes in the present life from believing in God. &quot;The gist of the renewed wager is that theists do better than non-theists regardless of whether or not God exists.&quot;

=== Climate change ===

Since at least 1992, some scholars have analogized Pascal&#x27;s wager to decisions about climate change. Two differences from Pascal&#x27;s wager are posited regarding climate change: first, climate change is more likely than Pascal&#x27;s God to exist, as there is scientific evidence for one but not the other. Secondly, the calculated penalty for unchecked climate change would be large, but is not generally considered to be infinite. Magnate Warren Buffett has written that climate change &quot;bears a similarity to Pascal&#x27;s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued that if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy.&quot;

<text>Pentacosmodon is a mammal genus from the Paleocene of North America, so it lived somewhat after the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot;. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata. It&#x27;s within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Microcosmodontidae.

The genus &quot;Pentacosmodon&quot;, named by Jepsen in 1940, is known from the species &quot;Pentacosmodon pronus&quot;. Fossil remains of this animal have been found in strata dating to the Upper Paleocene of Wyoming (United States) and the Porcupine Hills Formation near the Bow River of Alberta, Canada. This genus was previously placed within family Djadochtatherioidea.

<text>Route 81 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The route is a freeway connector between exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95 [I-95]) and U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) near Newark Liberty International Airport. It runs for , entirely within the city of Elizabeth in Union County. A freeway called Route S100 was initially proposed on the current alignment of Route 81 in 1938; it, along with its parent Route 100, was never built. The current route was conceived in the 1960s as a freeway replacement for Route 164, which followed Humboldt Avenue, a surface road. It was to be designated Route 76, but was renumbered to Route 81 when I-76 was created in New Jersey.

It was legislated in 1966 to run parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect US 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for the road and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.

==Route description==

Route 81 is a freeway for its entire length through Elizabeth in Union County. It southern terminus is at the toll plaza for exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), near The Mills at Jersey Gardens shopping mall and Elizabeth Center power center. The route heads north from this interchange as a four-lane a freeway maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. A short distance north of the toll plaza, the route comes to an interchange with County Route 624 (CR 624, North Avenue), which serves the aforementioned shopping areas as well as the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal.

Route 81 heads northwest, running in between the travel lanes of North Avenue for a distance, with industrial areas located to the southwest and Newark Liberty International Airport to the northeast. Upon splitting from North Avenue, Route 81 features a northbound ramp to Newark Liberty International Airport and has an interchange with Dowd Avenue. From here, the route continues along the airport property with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation before reaching its terminus at US 1/9 just south of the Elizabeth–Newark city line. South of the terminus, ramps allow Route 81 traffic to access either the local or express lanes of US 1/9 as well as Newark Liberty International Airport.

==History==
=== Predecessors to Route 81 ===

Route S100 was originally proposed as a freeway on the rough alignment of present-day Route 81 in 1938, running between the proposed Route 100 freeway (now the New Jersey Turnpike) and US 1/9 and Route 25. However, Route S100 was not built. The original plan in the early 1960s for what is now Route 81 was to connect Newark International Airport with Elizabeth Seaport, bypassing Humboldt Avenue, which at the time was designated Route 164; Humboldt Avenue is no longer a state highway. The planned route was initially numbered Route 76, but was renumbered to Route 81 when I-80S in the southern part of the state became I-76. In 1966, Route 81 was legislated to run parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 near the Goethals Bridge north to the vicinity of North Avenue, and head west along the southern edge of the airport to US 1/9. By the 1970s, it was decided by the state of New Jersey to have Route 81 start at a new interchange 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike. In 1975, Governor Brendan Byrne requested $882 million in bonds to construct several roads in New Jersey, including Route 81.

=== Construction begins and finishes ===

The state allocated a total of $50 million for construction of Route 81 in 1976, with $16.6 million to be used within the next year, and the design for the proposed road, which was to provide a direct link to Newark Airport, began. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANY&amp;NJ) was responsible for designing the road and half of the $1.6 million cost was to be paid for by the port authority while the state and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) were to split the other half. In 1977, the state wanted the PANY&amp;NJ to pay the $50 million to build Route 81 and filed suit. However, the state court of appeals ruled in 1978 that the PANY&amp;NJ could not help build the road as it needed permission from both the New Jersey and New York legislatures, who wanted the port authority to focus on mass transit construction to airports.

With the construction of the new interchange on the New Jersey Turnpike, a service area along the turnpike named after William Halsey was subsequently closed down. Exit 13A, in turn, revitalized the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal area. A retail center has arisen on the east side of the New Jersey Turnpike in an urban enterprise zone, accessible from the North Avenue exit off Route 81. With the construction of the Jersey Gardens outlet mall, exit 13A was reconstructed by Schoor DePalma Inc and financed by mall owner Glimcher Realty Trust.

<doc id="215551" wikidata="Q825852" url="?curid=215551" title="New Jersey Route 129">
<text>Route 129 is a north-south expressway in the capital city of Trenton, New Jersey. The highway runs along Canal Boulevard through portions of Trenton, serving as an alternative highway to its parent, Route 29. The route begins at an intersection with South Lamberton Road in Hamilton Township, and heads northward along NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line until terminating at an interchange with U.S. Route 1 (US 1; the Trenton Freeway).

The original use of Route 129 opened in 1961 on what is now Interstate 295 (I-295) from the Scudder Falls Bridge to Scotch Road in Trenton. The route was replaced in 1974 by I-95 (re-designated as I-295 in 2018), while the route&#x27;s current incarnation opened in September 1993 along a former portion of the Delaware and Raritan Canal. The route has remained virtually untouched since its opening.

==Route description==

Route 129 begins at an intersection with South Lamberton Road on the Delaware River in Hamilton Township. The highway proceeds northward as a two-lane divided freeway, passing through small fields and tree patches until reaching railroad tracks, where the route turns to the northwest, paralleling its parent, the Route 29 freeway to the west. Route 129 then intersects an onramp to Route 29 and passes to the east of a large factory. From there, the highway merges back together and comes upon a partial interchange with Route 29. Route 129 itself continues along the railroad tracks on Canal Boulevard, entering the city of Trenton, where it becomes a four-lane freeway.
At an intersection with Mercer County Route 650 (Lalor Street), Route 129 develops a grassy median and heads along the industrial portion of the city as a four-lane expressway. With NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line paralleling the highway, the state road serves access to large factories, a large residential district and Cass Street station along the River Line between Lalor Street and Cass Street. Route 129 continues northward along Canal, crossing under US 206 (South Broad Street) with a southbound exit to that road before passing east of CURE Insurance Arena. It crosses Hamilton Avenue north of the Hamilton Avenue station serving the light rail line before reaching an interchange with US 1, where Route 129 ends and Canal Boulevard&#x27;s right of way merges into the Trenton Freeway. This interchange has access to northbound US 1 and from southbound US 1, westbound Route 33, and Market Street.

==History==
Route 129 originates as the earliest designation on a freeway from the Scudder Falls Bridge on the Delaware River to the interchange with Scotch Road, which opened in 1961. At that point, the new freeway was proposed with an eastward extension to US 1. However, by 1974, Route 129 was re-designated as a portion of I-95, and is now designated as I-295. The current incarnation of Route 129 was constructed along a former portion of the Delaware and Raritan Canal as an alternate arterial boulevard to Route 29 that opened in September 1993 from South Lamberton Road to US 1 at a cost of $24.185 million (1993 USD) by the George Harms Construction Company. The route has remained virtually untouched since.

<text>James Hardesty Critchfield (January 30, 1917 – April 22, 2003) was an officer of the US Central Intelligence Agency who rose to become the chief of its Near East and South Asia division. He also served as the CIA&#x27;s national intelligence officer for energy in the 1970s and after he retired in 1974, he became an energy policy consultant in the Middle East, serving such clients as Sultan Qaboos of Oman. Critchfield served as the president of a Honeywell, Inc. subsidiary called Tetra Tech International.

==Biography==
Born in Hunter, North Dakota to a doctor and a schoolteacher, he attended North Dakota State University, participating in its ROTC program and graduating in 1939. His younger brother, Richard Critchfield, was a journalist and essayist who wrote primarily about villages in the developing world. James served in the United States Army in World War II, first in North Africa and up through Europe, where he was one of the youngest Colonels, leading the 2nd Battalion of 141st Infantry of the 36th Infantry Division. He was awarded the Bronze Star twice, and the Silver Star for gallantry in resisting a German assault on December 12, 1944.

Critchfield joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1948. He was tasked with gathering information about the Soviet Union from Reinhard Gehlen and his Gehlen Organization, the successor to the intelligence agencies of Nazi Germany. This work, which led to the creation of the post-war West German intelligence apparatus, came to include the use of Nazi war criminals.

Critchfield defended his actions when the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act made it public knowledge, disputing that Gehlen himself was a war criminal but admitting to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter that &quot;there&#x27;s no doubt that the CIA got carried away with recruiting some pretty bad people&quot;.

As the CIA&#x27;s Near East Division Chief from 1959 to 1969, Chritchfield was reported to have &quot;kept tabs on&quot; (in the words of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;) or even &quot;helped arrange&quot; (according to Timothy Naftali, writing in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;) the February 1963 coup that overthrew Abd al-Karim Qasim and first brought the Ba&#x27;ath Party to power in Iraq. Qasim&#x27;s expropriation of the concessionary holdings of the British- and American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company, as well as his threats to invade Kuwait, had caused many U.S. officials to regard his government as a threat to American interests in the Middle East. Chritchfield denied that the CIA had &quot;actively support[ed]&quot; the Ba&#x27;ath Party, but acknowledged that it was &quot;better informed on the 1963 coup in Baghdad than on any other major event or change of government that took place in the whole region in those years&quot;, explaining that &quot;we watched the Ba&#x27;ath&#x27;s long, slow preparation to take control&quot; and &quot;we knew perhaps six months beforehand that it was going to happen.&quot; Archival evidence indicates that a high-ranking member of the Party had informed the CIA of an earlier Ba&#x27;athist coup plot in mid-July 1962. It is not proven that the CIA was told in advance of the exact timing of the successful February 1963 coup, but longtime CIA officer Harry Rositzke later claimed &quot;the CIA&#x27;s major source, in an ideal catbird seat, reported the exact time of the coup and provided a list of the new cabinet members.&quot; Another former CIA official has stated that he was working with Archie Roosevelt, Jr. on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against Qasim, which was rendered moot by the latter&#x27;s assassination. This official &quot;denied any involvement in the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s actions.&quot;

His CIA work earned him a Distinguished Intelligence Medal and a Trailblazer Award.

His first wife, Constance Reich Critchfield, died in a traffic accident in 1948. A marriage to Louise Mithoff Critchfield ended in divorce, then in the 1970s he met and married fellow CIA officer Lois Matthews Critchfield.

James Critchfield died in Williamsburg, Virginia of pancreatic cancer, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His posthumous memoir &quot;Partners at the Creation&quot; was published by the Naval Institute Press in 2003.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor. Often referred to as the King of R&amp;B, he is recognized as an influential figure in contemporary R&amp;B and pop music. In 1994, Usher released his self-titled debut album at the age of 15. He rose to fame with the release of his second album, &quot;My Way&quot; (1997), which spawned his first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot;, and the top-two singles: the title track and &quot;You Make Me Wanna...&quot;.

His third album, &quot;8701&quot; (2001), saw continued success, selling eight million copies and yielding two number-one singles, &quot;U Remind Me&quot; and &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, as well as the top-three single, &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;. &quot;Confessions&quot; (2004) established Usher as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s, supported by four consecutive number-one singles—&quot;Yeah!&quot;, &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, and &quot;My Boo&quot;—and the top-ten &quot;Caught Up&quot;. The album sold over 20 million copies worldwide and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After splitting from his manager and mother Jonnetta Patton in 2007, he released the album &quot;Here I Stand&quot; (2008), which spawned the number-one single &quot;Love in This Club&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named him the second most successful artist of the decade, the number-one Hot 100 artist of the decade, and ranked &quot;Confessions&quot; as the top solo album of the decade.

Usher&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Raymond v. Raymond&quot; (2010), contained his ninth number-one single, &quot;OMG&quot;, making him one of the few artists to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in three consecutive decades. His debut extended play, &quot;Versus&quot; (2010), produced the top-five single &quot;DJ Got Us Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;. Usher&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; (2012) saw further electronic production; it spawned the top-ten single &quot;Scream&quot;. He followed it with the albums &quot;Hard II Love&quot; (2016) and &quot;Coming Home&quot; (2024), the latter of which became his first independent project. His Super Bowl LVIII halftime show in 2024 drew 123 million viewers domestically.

Usher has earned nine number-one singles and sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked him among the Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century. He has won numerous awards and accolades including 8 Grammy Awards, 12 Soul Train Music Awards, 8 American Music Awards, 3 Guinness World Records, 18 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2021. Usher co-founded the record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG) in a joint venture with talent manager Scooter Braun, which was the first label to sign Canadian singer Justin Bieber in 2008. Outside of music, Usher founded the charitable non-profit Usher&#x27;s New Look in 1999.

==Early life==
Usher Raymond IV was born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas. His parents are Jonnetta Patton (née O&#x27;Neal) and Usher Raymond III. He spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher&#x27;s family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, he attended North Springs High School.

==Career==
===Late 1980s–1996: Musical beginnings and &quot;Usher&quot;===
At age ten, Usher joined an R&amp;B local quintet called the NuBeginning, which was organized by local music promoter Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, &quot;Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV&quot;, was only made available regionally and by mail order. However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a &quot;bad experience&quot;. The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.

At age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta. Alexander, who at the time was Bobby Brown&#x27;s bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows. Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an A&amp;R representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after Usher sang Boyz II Men hit record &quot;End of the Road&quot;. Usher&#x27;s mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career. He was introduced to the public on &quot;Call Me a Mack&quot;, a song recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;.

While preparing for his debut album, Usher lost his voice. He was going through puberty and had a difficult time adjusting his vocals. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher, put his album on hold and considered dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and they did. From this point Reid didn&#x27;t know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York City in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive Sean Combs—also known as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy—to &quot;attend&quot; what Reid called &quot;Flavor Camp&quot;. Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he described this period as the &quot;hardest days&quot; of his life. &quot;I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York&quot; he said.

On August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher&#x27;s self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean Combs. &quot;Usher&quot; peaked at number twenty-five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: &quot;Can U Get wit It&quot;, &quot;Think of You&quot;, and &quot;The Many Ways&quot;. The album sold over 500,000 copies, by December 2008. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex, and him only being 15 years old, the public had a difficult time believing that this was so. Again LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn&#x27;t as successful as they anticipated. At this time Usher&#x27;s mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately giving L.A. Reid more confidence in Usher.

After graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on LaFace&#x27;s version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Straighten It Out&quot;, a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica; and on &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, from LaFace&#x27;s 1996 Olympic Games benefit album &quot;Rhythm of the Games&quot;. He was also featured on &quot;I Swear I&#x27;m In Love&quot; off the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Kazaam&quot;.

===1997–2003: &quot;My Way&quot; and &quot;8701&quot;===
Usher developed a friendship with American record producer Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, &quot;My Way&quot;, released on September 16, 1997. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;You Make Me Wanna...&quot;, reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher&#x27;s first record to be top single; this resulted in him increasing in popularity. It also became Usher&#x27;s first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot;, peaked in January 1998 at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. &quot;My Way&quot; has been certified seven-time platinum in the United States.

&quot;You Make Me Wanna...&quot; won the Best Male R&amp;B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy&#x27;s &quot;No Way Out&quot; tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Rope Tour&quot;. Usher&#x27;s first concert album, &quot;Live&quot;, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil&#x27; Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.

Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series &quot;Moesha&quot;, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Faculty&quot;. Usher&#x27;s extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year, as he was cast in the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. He completed two more films, &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, and his first starring role in &quot;Light It Up&quot;. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie &quot;Geppetto&quot;.

Usher&#x27;s third studio album, originally titled &quot;All About U&quot;, was stated to be released in early 2001. The first single, &quot;Pop Ya Collar&quot;, was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. At the same time, LaFace went dormant, moving most of its artists, including Usher, to its parent company, Arista Records. After having revised and renamed to &quot;8701&quot;, the album was released on August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles &quot;U Remind Me&quot; and &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; each topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. &quot;8701&quot; has been certified five-time platinum in the United States.

Usher appeared in the 2001 film &quot;Texas Rangers&quot;. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;U Remind Me&quot;. The next year, he won the same award for &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;, making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In the summer of 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy&#x27;s &quot;I Need a Girl, Part I&quot;. The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, and &quot;American Dreams&quot;, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.

===2004–2009: &quot;Confessions&quot; and &quot;Here I Stand&quot;===
Usher&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Confessions&quot;, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, &quot;Yeah!&quot;, was in its sixth week at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s nearly 1.1 million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&amp;B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history. The album has since sold over 20 million copies worldwide, with over 14 million in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the RIAA.

The album&#x27;s second and third singles, &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles, In September 2004, &quot;My Boo&quot;, a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the album&#x27;s fourth number-one single. In December, the album&#x27;s final single &quot;Caught Up&quot; peaked at number eight on the Hot 100. By that time, Arista went inactive and following its parent, BMG&#x27;s merger with Sony Music, his previous label, LaFace, was revived under the Jive/Zomba Group banner, bringing Usher back to the fold.

&quot;Confessions&quot; earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for &quot;My Boo&quot;, which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Yeah!&quot;; and Contemporary R&amp;B Album for &quot;Confessions&quot;. At the 2004 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades.

Usher supported &quot;Confessions&quot; with &quot;The Truth Tour&quot;. The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian were the opening acts for the tour.

Usher at select dates would bring out a special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song &quot;Throwback&quot;. During a more intimate part of the show, Usher&#x27;s dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites &quot;Do it to Me&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot;. Usher also performed the Confessions Pt. II remix, where Kanye West would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit &quot;Yeah&quot;. This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth &quot;Live from Atlanta&quot;. It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.

In the spring of 2005, Usher scored a number three Hot 100 hit as a featured vocalist on Lil Jon&#x27;s &quot;Lovers &amp; Friends&quot;. In 2007, Usher also collaborated with R. Kelly on the track &quot;Same Girl&quot;, for Kelly&#x27;s album Double Up. He was also featured in a remix version of Omarion&#x27;s &quot;Ice Box&quot;. Usher also appeared on the track &quot;Shake Down&quot; on American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. According to Robert Hilburn of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Usher was voted number-one on the executive voting based &quot;Pop&#x27;s Power List&quot; and described as a &quot;sure-fire property&quot;. In November 2005, Usher starred as a disc jockey named Darrell in the Lions Gate film &quot;In the Mix&quot;.

On August 22, 2006, Usher took over the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;. Usher&#x27;s opening night brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez among others. Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher&#x27;s run in &quot;Chicago,&quot; which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reports that Usher&#x27;s absence cost the production an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. The producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler, issued a statement sending his &quot;thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. We all hope that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime.&quot;

His seventh studio album &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: &quot;What he wanted to do [on &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot;] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he&#x27;s been for the past 12 to 15 years. He&#x27;s growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that&#x27;s new, cultural, and that&#x27;s affecting people sonically. That&#x27;s kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate&quot;. In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; is &quot;the most artistic of an album&quot; he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a &quot;rebirth&quot; and that prior to &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot;, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself &quot;I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me&quot;.

His narratives have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and love, resembling &quot;an R&amp;B Casanova&quot;. &quot;Usher&quot; was new jack swing oriented, while &quot;My Way&quot; contained influences of soul. &quot;8701&quot; &quot;introduces touches of &#x27;80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of &#x27;80s hip hop&quot; displaying versatility, according to NME&#x27;s Lucy O&#x27;Brien. &quot;Confessions&quot; is viewed as a &quot;top-of-the-line pop-soul showcase&quot;, with established critic Robert Hilburn of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; seeing lead single &quot;Yeah!&quot; as something Michael Jackson would have created &quot;if he still had the old &quot;Thriller&quot; magic&quot;. &quot;Here I Stand&quot; was noted as more ballad-heavy by critics, where the title track&#x27;s usage of jazz notably drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder. &quot;Raymond V Raymond&quot; was described as a &quot;skillful fusion of R&amp;B/hip-hop/pop&quot; by Billboard. &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; further explored progressive R&amp;B, hip hop ballads, and synth pop, with its overall sound coined &quot;hybrid pop&quot; for its dynamic incorporation of EDM, dubstep, neo soul, and funk. &quot;Hard II Love&quot; sees &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Maura Johnston view it to &quot;stretch the boundaries of R&amp;B while winding toward the brooding atmospherics that have enveloped much of pop over the past 12 months&quot;.
On many occasions, Usher has named Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, &quot;He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn&#x27;t be who I am today without Michael Jackson&quot;. During the television special &#x27;Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special&#x27;, Usher was able to dance with Jackson while performing &quot;You Rock My World&quot;. Prince being another main influence, Usher said &quot;every album I&#x27;d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he&#x27;s a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.&quot; In &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People&quot; issue, he explained &quot;I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn&#x27;t have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.&quot; Other musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.

The boy band New Edition and its solo member Bobby Brown were childhood influences. Usher told ABC News, &quot;I can remember as a kid attending a New Edition Concert&quot;, and called it &quot;one of the greatest moments in my performance history&quot; years later when he was invited on stage with the group to perform &quot;N.E. Heartbreak&quot; at a concert in Washington, D.C. On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, &quot;the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;&quot;, and that he admired him &quot;Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R&amp;B and rhythmic music&quot;. Usher&#x27;s &quot;Live&quot; album would feature a medley performance of Brown&#x27;s original singles - &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Every Little Step&quot;, &quot;Rock Wit&#x27;cha&quot;, and &quot;Roni&quot;. Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot; album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his second album &quot;My Way.&quot; Prince would inspire &quot;Nice &amp; Slow&quot; while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. Usher&#x27;s third album &quot;8701&quot; would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. His fourth album was inspired by the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and Eminem whom he credited for the album having a transparent reputation. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway, &quot;The honesty of hip-hop, and what Eminem was saying in his records, it motivated me. Like, yo if he could be &quot;that&quot; honest, you know through hip-hop - and there&#x27;ve been other stories, storytellers, but never quite as vivid as his...and I got that Cleveland, because, you know with the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, you know what I&#x27;m saying, is to just understanding that the rhythm and the flip of it to make it be able to make it be at least, you know, hip-hop appropriate.&quot;

===Vocal style===
Usher possesses a leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 4 notes, and is considered to be &quot;one of the most soothing in R&amp;B&quot;. At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on &quot;Star Search&quot;, with 12 seconds. Usher&#x27;s vocal coach since &quot;My Way&quot;, Jan Smith, cites him as &quot;the single most gifted singer I&#x27;ve ever worked with in 26 years&quot;. On the dynamic &quot;8701&quot;, Rolling Stone&#x27;s Kathryn McGuire describes his vocals as &quot;velvety&quot; and &quot;impressively adaptable&quot; as it won him his first two Grammys as Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. With &quot;Confessions&quot;, Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; generally noted him as &quot;long on control and short on texture&quot;. He received another Grammy Award nomination in 2006 through a cover of Luther Vandross&#x27;s &quot;Superstar&quot; he performed on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 2005. &quot;Here I Stand&quot; displayed his vocals as &quot;agile&quot; and &quot;balletic&quot;, as well as his ability to &quot;easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto&quot; that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. On his One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour in 2008, Lee Hildebrand of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; assessed &quot;Usher&#x27;s chest tones have a ringing, Gaye-like quality, and his high head tones suggest Prince&#x27;s falsetto, but his frequent use of syllable-splitting curlicues owes much to Wonder. Usher is a stronger, more assured singer than he was a decade ago, though the melismas in his lower range sometimes meander off pitch. His falsetto tonality is more on target.&quot;

&quot;Looking For Myself&quot; exemplified his vocal craft earning him positive acclaim as Gawker&#x27;s Rick Juzwiak states &quot;his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one&quot; with emphasis on his falsetto being &quot;something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice ... he&#x27;s the picture of grace against shrieking synths ... His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other&quot;. On &quot;Climax&quot;, his performance lauded as &quot;blistering&quot; by Maura Johnston, and &quot;hair-raising&quot; by Jody Rosen, as he won Best R&amp;B Performance in 2013. &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot; and &quot;Dive&quot; are also commended as showcase standouts of his &quot;superior R&amp;B vocal range&quot; by Consequence of Sound&#x27;s Ryan Hadfield, and MadameNoire&#x27;s Brande Victorian. For &quot;Hard II Love&quot;, Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented &quot;a genuinely expressive voice that encompasses an ardent croon, a melting falsetto and quick, singsong declamation&quot;. On the 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Usher ranked at number 97.

===Performance===

Usher&#x27;s stage performances have been complimented by critics as &quot;packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship&quot;, and his presence &quot;engaging enough to pull off a one-man show&quot;. &quot;Vibe magazine&quot; notes him as being Bobby Brown-esque for his displays of &quot;brash sexuality and arrogance&quot;, leading to antics such as being &quot;prone to dropping his pants&quot;, and a &quot;tendency to shed his shirt on stage&quot;, while John Aizlewood of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that &quot;For all his pelvic thrusting and crotch-grabbing, Usher is a rather courtly presence.&quot; On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; hailed his simultaneous ability, stating &quot;the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that&#x27;s how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher&#x27;s most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today&#x27;s high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it&#x27;s a lost art&quot;, claiming his show &quot;ended the reign of &#x27;Nsync, Britney and the rest of the lip-synching, teen-pop acts&quot;. Usher told &quot;People&quot; magazine &quot;James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him&quot;, and has seen comparisons to his influences. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, he performed &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; and &quot;Yeah!&quot; under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 13 of their &quot;20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances&quot;.

Chad Batka for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;He has established himself as one of R&amp;B&#x27;s supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary.&quot; Capable of playing the piano, he also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and bass guitar, amid singles &quot;Good Kisser&quot; and &quot;She Came to Give It to You&quot; in 2014. The UR Experience Tour consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; called him &quot;a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage&quot;. Maura Johnston of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labels him the &quot;Award Show King&quot;, explaining &quot;His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He&#x27;s an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television.&quot;

Usher has been regarded as &quot;an international sex symbol&quot; since a young age, predominantly for his stage persona. Fusion states &quot;Usher—one of the greatest R&amp;B sex symbols in the past 20 years, paving the way for Chris Brown, Trey Songz and Justin Bieber—used sex as a major part of his image&quot;, while VH1 considers him to be &quot;the sexiest male performer ever to walk a stage&quot;. &quot;People&quot; magazine named Usher the &quot;Sexiest R&amp;B Star&quot; in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in &quot;his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics&quot;. They included him in their 2004 &quot;Sexiest Men Alive&quot;, and 2008 &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; lists. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Kelefa Sanneh referred to him as &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most famous ex-boyfriends&quot; after his breakup with Chilli of TLC. He was ranked number-one on BET&#x27;s &quot;All Shades of Fine: 25 Hottest Men of the Past 25 Years&quot; special in 2005. Madame Tussauds New York also unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience, and for the opening of a VIP room in 2007. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranks &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; amongst its &quot;30 Sexiest Music Videos of All Time&quot;.

After his marriage to Tameka Foster, his sexual appeal was expected to mature as &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Sasha Frere-Jones wrote &quot;The challenge here is to convince us that he is a married and responsible man—grown and sexy, [...]—without sacrificing the louche, frictionless sense of play that made him famous.&quot; VH1 have listed Usher at number 9 of its 100 Sexiest Artists List. According to &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine, he was one of the &quot;Sexiest Men&quot; of 2010, and 2011. In 2012, Billboard reviewed his fashion evolution stating &quot;The singer came onto the scene in the &#x27;90s rocking baggy jeans and suits that made us question his celebrity status, but over the years this R&amp;B star has developed his own signature look, rendering him a modern day fashion icon&quot;. In 2013, Complex placed him in its &quot;Most Stylish R&amp;B Singers of the 90s&quot; list. &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine was covered by Usher on its 25th anniversary issue, with Lou Schuler calling him &quot;the man with the best abs in the entertainment industry&quot;. In 2014 and 2015, his Calvin Klein Collection suits saw him listed as &quot;Best Dressed Men&quot; by outlets at the Golden Globe Awards and Grammy Awards. InStyle have rated him both in their &quot;Hottest Celebrity Abs&quot; collection, and &quot;37 of the Most Stylish Dads&quot; list.

==Legacy==

Usher was named the Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s by &quot;Billboard&quot; stating &quot;Usher&#x27;s sexy brand of R&amp;B dominated the last decade with the top-selling album and more No. 1s than any other act&quot;, with &quot;Confessions&quot; selling 20 million copies worldwide as the top solo album. Considered by Bonsu Thompson of Vibe to be &quot;the &quot;Thriller&quot; of our generation&quot;, Kia Turner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that it &quot;became ingrained in pop culture&quot; because of its theme. Pop music critic Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarks that &quot;For a while, &quot;Confessions&quot; was pop music&quot; and says it &quot;may turn out to have been the last true blockbuster in pop&quot;. Clay Cane said in 2008 &quot;We didn&#x27;t see pop-R&amp;B artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of those people in the 90s who was the catalyst for that; he was kind of the pioneer ... He&#x27;s the greatest example of pure crossover success&quot;. Described as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson by writers of &quot;VH1&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jody Rosen said in 2012 &quot;He&#x27;s the biggest male pop singer in the world; sometimes, it seems like he&#x27;s the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas&quot;. Attaining 9 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles to tie with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney, Justin Charity of &quot;Complex&quot; referred to him as &quot;the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades&quot; in 2015.

James Brown, performed a duet with Usher in 2005 at the 47th Grammy Awards in which he honorably dubbed him the Godson of Soul. Brown reiterated &quot;The new godson; Usher, the new godson&quot; following the performance. Often cited as an &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Randall Roberts marks dance singles &quot;Yeah!&quot;, &quot;Caught Up&quot; and &quot;OMG&quot; to have influenced contemporary dance-pop, stating the former two also &quot;helped define the [20]00s&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s pop stardom ranking metric, ranked Usher 3rd in history, based on &quot;all-time chart performance and contemporary significance&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named &quot;Confessions Part II&quot; the greatest R&amp;B song of the 21st century and &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot; the 25th.

Usher has been referred to as the &quot;King of R&amp;B&quot;, as well as &quot;Mr. Entertainment&quot; by &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. The BET Honors honored him for his contributions to music with a Musical Arts award in 2015, presented by Bobby Brown who said &quot;You remain a game changer, for your discipline, for your perfectionism. You&#x27;re just a god man&quot;. The BET Honors highlighted his influence on many contemporary artists such as Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Drake, Justin Bieber, Jason Derulo, Miguel, Omarion, Ray J, August Alsina, and Eric Bellinger. Ne-Yo further cited Usher as an influence upon the honor saying &quot;I feel that without Usher, there would be no me, there would be no Chris Brown, there would be no Trey Songz. He paved the way for us&quot;. Other artists who have also cited him as an influence are Zayn Malik and Liam Payne of One Direction, Bryson Tiller, Jungkook of BTS, Lucky Daye, 6lack, Rico Love, Jeremih, Anderson Paak, Trevor Jackson, Sam Hunt, Leon Bridges, Sammie, B.Smyth, Jacob Latimore, Kevin Woo, Keke Palmer, Justine Skye, BJ The Chicago Kid, Roy Woods, YK Osiris, Lukas Magyar of Veil of Maya, Bruno Mars, and actor Tahj Mowry.

Usher, along with sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Beyonce, Rihanna, Madonna, J.Cole, Nicki Minaj, and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticized for their low payout of royalties.&quot;The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value&quot;, stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.

When asked why he partnered with Yoobi, Usher said, &quot;Preparing future leaders through my New Look Foundation has always been about having the proper tools to succeed in life. If they don&#x27;t have the tools, young men and women from underserved communities can&#x27;t even begin to understand the idea of having a new or different perspective. So that&#x27;s where this collaboration came together giving young people the tools and supplying them with hope.&quot;

In 2013, Usher partnered with Samsung shooting a 2:28 minute short film directed by Rich Lee that included his single &quot;Looking 4 Myself&quot; from his then new album. The video features two Ushers in a face-off, as &quot;down-to-earth&quot; Usher seeks revenge against his &quot;celebrity&quot; alter ego after fame destroys his relationship.

===Philanthropy===
Usher founded New Look, a non-profit charity organization which aims to &quot;provide young people with a new look on life through education and real-world experience&quot;. Its flagship project, camp New Look, ran from July 11 to 23, 2005, in Clark Atlanta University. In 2006, the charity started an initiative called Our Block, for which it helped rebuild and revitalize city blocks in New Orleans. The project went on one street at a time, and the funding was helped through part of the proceeds of Usher&#x27;s team-up with Armani Exchange in creating &quot;Love 4 Life&quot; dog tags, which were made available at the company&#x27;s stores and Web site. Since then, Usher has launched chapters of New Look in such cities as Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, and Washington, D.C. New Look has four basic pillars; Talent, Education, Service, and Career. New Look program begins in the 8th grade and progresses through a student&#x27;s high school and post-secondary education. Education is the center focus, Usher and his program ensures this. Students who participate in Usher&#x27;s New Look achieve 100% graduation rates and all of New Look participants go on to Higher Education or Job Placement.

In 1999, Usher participated in &quot;Challenge for the Children&quot;, a benefit basketball game hosted by American boy band NSYNC. The event, which was held on the campus of Georgia State University, had raised an estimated $50,000 for several local charities. In 2005, Usher is one among the artists who signed on for a Hurricane Katrina relief concert. He has also performed a public service announcement to promote Do Something&#x27;s campaign for civic engagement.

After the devastating events of Hurricane Katrina, Usher launched Project Restart that would go on to help more than 700 families with housing and keeping their lights on. Usher also while in New Orleans would meet with students from Dillard and Xavier to aid them with cleaning up the city. &quot;I&#x27;m here to physically do something and hopefully motivate other people to do the same,&quot; said Usher in an interview. Usher, because of his efforts and dedication to helping the city of New Orleans rebuild was presented the key to the city of New Orleans in 2008 from former Mayor Ray Nagin. Also in this presentation, Usher in his honor was proclaimed his own day, Usher Day.

In 2011, Usher was honored with the Freedom Award by the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. The Freedom Awards honor individuals who work for justice, equality, philanthropy, civil and human rights and humanitarian causes. Raymond was awarded this honor for his philanthropic work done by his New Look Foundation. Others honored with this award in the past Usher included Oprah, Ruby Dee, Harry Belafonte, Cicely Tyson, Coretta Scott King, and other great figures.

On February 12, 2015, Usher visited his former hometown Chattanooga making a surprise visit at Dalewood Middle School, the Orange Grove Center and the Center for the Creative Arts. Dalewood is the middle school he attended before moving to Atlanta and the school is not that far away from the road &quot;Usher Raymond Parkway&quot; that was presented to Usher in 2001. Usher spoke to students at the Center for the Creative arts explaining the importance of education. His effort of giving back was to honor the legacy of his grandmother who passed early in the year. Who he called Nanny expressed to singer at a young age &quot;whatever you want to do, I promise you can do it. We&#x27;re going to look back one day, your teachers and I, and be very proud of you&quot;. At CCC, a donation of an undisclosed amount was made by the singer that would pay for new surfaces for the floors of two dance studios, a new digital lighting board and LED lights for the performing arts school&#x27;s auditorium. Usher&#x27;s second stop was Orange Grove Center, a nonprofit that serves adults and children with intellectual disabilities. There, he took part in a groundbreaking for planned improvements to the facility&#x27;s track, said development director Heidi Hoffecker. The track will be named the Nancy Lackey Memorial Track to honor his grandmother.

In 2015, Usher teamed up with Anthony Anderson, Kevin Hart, Big Sean, Chris Paul, and more collectively donating more than $500,000 in scholarships that was given to 20 students attending historically black colleges and universities. This is following the partnership with the UNCF in 2014 creating the Usher Raymond Scholarship Program, where last year he gave a student $100,000 to attend the Tuskegee University.

In 2016, Usher, alongside Tyrese, Future, Ludacris, and Jeezy donated $25,000 each to the UNCF during the 33rd annual Atlanta&#x27;s Mayors Ball.

On February 18, 2017, Morehouse College during the 29th annual &quot;A Candle in the Dark Gala&quot; honored Usher with the prestigious Candle Award for his philanthropy and contributions to music. The Candle Award honors recipients for excellence in athletics, business, education, entertainment, and other arenas. Past recipients honored at the &quot;Candle in the Dark&quot; include Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Berry Gordy, and Smokey Robinson.

To complete the final $100,000 of his goal, Kaepernick launched the #10for10 campaign He made 10 donations of $10,000 to 10 different charities with 10 celebrities matching him with $10,000. Usher selected the H.O.M.E. (Helping Oppressed Mothers Endure) charity in Lithonia, Georgia to receive a combined donation of $20,000.

===Politics and activism===

In 2007, Usher launched his campaign in &quot;Change in the South&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia on the campus of Georgia Tech in support of then presidential hopeful Barack Obama. Obama asked Usher to serve as National Co-chair for his voter registration campaign &quot;Vote for Change&quot;. Doing more groundwork for Obama the following year Usher and Kerry Washington would lead a rally on the campus of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, S.C. In 2008, Usher supported the Service Nation campaign, serving as the Service Nation Youth Chair. Usher stated &quot;As an artist, I am often recognized for the music I make and the performances I give. I&#x27;m blessed to have had the opportunity to be a part of many incredible moments. But this is the work that inspires me, empowering young people to become active in their communities&quot;. Usher also released an exclusive song &quot;Hush&quot; that was influenced by social issues and voting, In the video he features a motivational Barack Obama speech. Usher performed &quot;Higher Ground&quot; alongside Stevie Wonder and Shakira at the 2009 presidential inauguration at the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on January 18, 2009. He continued to endorse Obama in 2012 and supported on the 2012 reelection campaign.

On September 13, 2014, Usher and Bill Clinton held a special campaign event for Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Nunn was honored for her work with the Points of Light Foundation at a charity event in 2010 and has been a semiregular attendee at Clinton Foundation events since 2009. Usher&#x27;s New Look Foundation also awarded Clinton its Service Legacy Award in 2010.

In October 2015, Usher partnered with the organization Sankofa which focuses on issues of social injustice that disproportionately affect the disenfranchised, the oppressed, and the underserved. On October 23, 2015, Usher and the founder of Sankofa, former Civil Rights Activist, Harry Belafonte led the conversation titled &quot;Breaking the Chains of Social Injustice&quot; at 92nd Street Y in Manhattan speaking about popular culture and activism. At this panel he introduced his music video &quot;Chains&quot; featuring Nas and Bibi Bourelly. The music video is geared towards facing the issues of social injustice and features images of Trayvon Martin, Rekia Boyd, Sean Bell, Marlon Brown, Ramarley Graham, Amadou Diallo, Caesar Cruz, and other recent victims of police violence.

In August 2015, he attended a major celebrity fundraiser at the Brentwood home of Scooter Braun held for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, and Tom Hanks were also among the crowd of 250 whose ticket prices were of $2,700 per person.

Usher was selected among a 33-member delegate for the Presidential Committee for Arts and Humanities of the United States of America to Cuba seeking to strengthen cultural ties between the two countries. Less than a month after the historic visit by President Barack Obama, a U.S. government cultural mission to Cuba took place from April 18–21, 2016. The President described his trip as extending the hand of friendship to the Cuban people, and this delegation, including some of America&#x27;s most distinguished writers, artists, musicians, as well as arts and cultural leaders, will continue this historic collaboration with the Cuban people.

==Personal life==

In 2001, Usher began dating TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their relationship lasted for three years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album that would become &quot;Confessions&quot;, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were not inspired by Usher&#x27;s private life, but by Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans&#x27; curiosity about how much of the infidelity story was Usher&#x27;s own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas&#x27;s suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2004.

This was followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of &quot;Confessions&quot;. Many fans believed that the infidelity portrayed in &quot;Confessions&quot; was real, and the real reason for the split. In February 2004, in an interview on &quot;The Bert Show&quot; on the Atlanta radio channel Q100, Thomas was perceived as insinuating that Usher cheated on her: &quot;Usher did the ultimate no-no to me. ... I will never be with him again, and that is that&quot;. Usher defended: &quot;... it just didn&#x27;t work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain&#x27;t what broke it up&quot;. This was backed up years later by Thomas, who said &quot;People assumed that album was about us, but it was not.&quot;

In 2004, it was reported that Usher briefly dated British supermodel Naomi Campbell for a few months, together the pair attended the MTV Europe Music Awards and it was reported that Campbell jumped out of a pop out cake to surprise him for his birthday. The following year, he was linked to model Eishia Brightwell for some time. They were seen together at different events including the Grammys, the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Oscar party and the NAACP Awards.

In November 2005, Usher began dating stylist Tameka Foster, who worked as his personal stylist for several years. Their engagement was announced in February 2007. After the sudden cancellation of a planned July wedding in the Hamptons, the two were wed on August 3, 2007, in a civil ceremony in Atlanta. This was followed by a larger wedding ceremony on September 1, 2007, held at the Chateau Elan Winery &amp; Resort outside Atlanta.

Usher&#x27;s father, Usher Raymond III, died on January 21, 2008.

Upon his marriage to Foster, Usher became a stepfather to Foster&#x27;s three sons from previous relationships, one born when she was a teenager and two from her first marriage to Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover. Usher and Foster also have two sons together: Usher &quot;Cinco&quot; Raymond V, born in November 2007, and Naviyd Ely Raymond, born in December 2008.

In February 2009, two months after the birth of their second son, Foster suffered a cardiac arrest in São Paulo, Brazil, when she was given general anesthesia prior to scheduled cosmetic surgery (reportedly liposuction), which was ultimately not performed. She was induced into a coma to aid her recovery and was transferred to a larger facility, the Hospital Sírio-Libanês. Usher canceled his performance at Clive Davis&#x27;s pre-Grammy Gala in order to fly to Brazil to be with Foster. After a week of recovery, Foster&#x27;s surgeon issued a statement saying that she was &quot;doing very well&quot;.

Usher filed for divorce from Foster in June 2009 in Atlanta. The divorce was legally finalized in Fulton County Court on November 4, 2009. This preceded a highly publicized child custody dispute spanning three years, which ultimately culminated on August 24, 2012, with a judge awarding Usher primary custody of his two sons with Foster.

In 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine placed Usher at number 32 on its Celebrity 100, and reported his earnings after the OMG Tour to stand at $46 million, ranking him at number 12 on &quot;The World&#x27;s 25 Highest-Paid Musicians&quot; list.

Usher was reported to have adopted a vegan diet in 2012.

Foster&#x27;s 11-year-old son Kile Glover, Usher&#x27;s former stepson, was declared brain dead on July 8, 2012, after being struck by a personal water craft on Lake Lanier the previous day. Glover died on July 21, 2012, after being removed from life support. Just over a year later, on August 5, 2013, Usher&#x27;s eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher&#x27;s home. The next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and citing Usher V&#x27;s &quot;near-death accident&quot; as evidence of a lack of supervision of the children. At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons.

In September 2015, Usher quietly married his long-time girlfriend and manager Grace Miguel while vacationing in Cuba. There was speculation of the two being married when Miguel&#x27;s Instagram post showed a picture of a gold wedding band on Usher&#x27;s finger. He confirmed the marriage during an interview on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

On July 19, 2017, documents leaked online allege that Usher has been a carrier of the herpes virus since 2009 or 2010 and that he infected a partner with it in 2012. It alleges that Usher paid the woman&#x27;s doctor bills and settled a civil suit with her for $1.1 million. Amid the allegations, &quot;TMZ&quot; reported that another woman filed a $10 million lawsuit against Usher claiming that he exposed her to the herpes virus without her knowledge or consent, which is a crime in certain states. &quot;TMZ&quot; followed up this story with another alleging that she increased her lawsuit to $20 million after testing positive.

Three more claimants sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and did not tell them in advance. All three were represented by attorney Lisa Bloom, who said on August 8, 2017, that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from him. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended. The other two accusers, one male and one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative and Bloom stated she did not know if the singer had the disease.

On March 6, 2018, Usher and wife Grace Miguel informed &quot;Us Weekly&quot; of their separation in a statement that read, in part: &quot;After much thought and consideration we have mutually decided to separate as a couple ... We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives&quot;. On December 28, 2018, Usher filed for divorce from Miguel in Georgia.

In September 2020, it was confirmed that Usher was expecting his third child, with music executive Jenn Goicoechea, whom he reportedly started dating in October 2019. Their daughter was born on September 24, 2020. Usher and Goicoecha welcomed their second child together on September 29, 2021. Usher and Goiciechea married in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 11, 2024, immediately following Usher&#x27;s Super Bowl performance.

<text>The Blue Bird Corporation (originally known as the Blue Bird Body Company) is an American bus manufacturer headquartered in Fort Valley, Georgia. Best known for its production of school buses, the company has also manufactured a wide variety of other bus types, including transit buses, motorhomes, and specialty vehicles such as mobile libraries and mobile police command centers. Currently, Blue Bird concentrates its product lineup on school buses, school pupil activity buses, and specialty vehicle derivatives.

Blue Bird Body Company was founded in 1927 in Fort Valley, Georgia, as A.L. Luce closed his automobile dealership to concentrate exclusively on bus production. Remaining under family control into the early 1990s, Blue Bird changed hands several times in the 2000s; in February 2015, it became a publicly owned company (with previous owner Cerberus Capital Management holding a 58% share).

==History==
=== 1927–1930s ===
As the second quarter of the 20th century began, Albert Luce Sr. was an entrepreneur who developed some of the earliest purpose-built school buses, transitioned from wagons. What is now Blue Bird Corporation began life as a side project in a Ford Motor Company dealership in Perry, Georgia. Along with the dealership in Perry, Luce owned the Ford franchise in Fort Valley, Georgia, a rural farming community south of Macon.

In 1925, Luce sold a customer a Ford Model T with a wooden bus body; the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers. Due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural Georgia roads, the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle. Driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers, Luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads. In place of wood, Luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheet metal; wood was used as a secondary material. Completed in 1927, the bus was put into use as a school bus.

While buses would initially remain a side project for Luce (with only nine bus bodies produced between 1929 and 1931), the onset of the Great Depression would change his company forever. Following a 95% decline in car sales in 1931, Luce sold both of his Ford dealerships, using the $12,000 proceeds from the sale to begin his own company, concentrating solely on bus production. Inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy, Luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools.

The early use of farm wagons on a part-time basis soon evolved into purpose-built school bus products, each with economy and function as major priorities. In 1937, the company began production of full-steel bus bodies, an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the United States.

In a 1939 conference, Blue Bird engineers contributed to the selection of school bus yellow, still in use today.

==== Blue Bird Number One ====
Completed in 1927, the first bus completed by A.L. Luce was sold to a customer and put into use as a school bus. Following the establishment of Blue Bird Body Company in 1932, the bus became retroactively known as Blue Bird &quot;Number One&quot;. In 1946, the bus was reacquired by the Luce family; as part of the restoration, the body was placed on a Ford Model TT chassis, undergoing a second restoration in the 1970s.

In 2008, Blue Bird &quot;Number One&quot; was donated to the Henry Ford Museum, marking the 100th anniversary of the Model T Ford and the 80th anniversary of its construction.

Alongside the 1948 Blue Bird All American, a replica of Blue Bird Number One sits on the Blue Bird factory floor in Fort Valley.

===1940s===
By the 1940s, the demand for school buses expanded the presence of Blue Bird from rural Georgia to multiple states across the Southern United States. Following World War II, several changes across the country further created a need for school buses. In all but the most remote rural communities, centralized schools (with the graded class structure of urban schools) had succeeded one-room schoolhouses. In metropolitan areas, urban populations began to move into suburbs. Depending on location, the practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical (particularly as students progressed into high school). At the end of the decade, the baby-boom generation began their education, having an impact across the education system for the next 30 years.

Near the end of 1945, the company suffered a major setback, as its Fort Valley factory was destroyed by fire (nearly claiming the life of A.L. Luce). While the factory building was burned to the ground, a significant amount of equipment was salvaged along with a number of buses on the assembly line. Production was restarted on a makeshift assembly line on other company property, with some work completed under tents. The Fort Valley factory was rebuilt by the spring of 1946, following several challenges; while building materials themselves were no longer rationed, the ability to secure large quantities of beams, trusses, and sheetmetal remained a formidable task.

Following a 1946 heart attack, A.L. Luce began to hand over day-to-day operations of Blue Bird to his three sons. By the end of the decade, the company became the seventh-largest school bus manufacturer in the United States.

==== World War II production ====
Following the outbreak of World War II, school bus production went on hiatus; Blue Bird produced buses for the U.S. Navy. As steel was heavily rationed, company engineers were required to re-engineer the body designs, using wood as part of the body structure.

Alongside its buses for the Navy, Blue Bird also produced ambulance buses. Intended for mass evacuations, the vehicles were fitted with four stretchers.

====All American====
In 1948, on a trip to Europe, A.L. Luce and his son George attended the 1948 Paris Auto Show. After viewing a GM-chassis forward-control bus on display, Luce sought to buy a similar bus chassis to produce with a Blue Bird body. Unable to secure a chassis, Luce instead purchased the display vehicle, importing it to the United States.

After reverse-engineering the chassis design (to modify American-produced vehicles), Blue Bird completed its first forward-control prototype in 1949, naming it the All American. In 1950, the All American entered full-scale production. For 1952, Blue Bird became the first school bus manufacturer to produce its own chassis (rather than from outside suppliers). With the exception of the van-based Micro Bird, Blue Bird builds the chassis of each bus its produces.

Currently in its sixth generation, the Blue Bird All American is the longest-running bus model line. While not the first forward-control school bus (the Crown Supercoach was introduced in 1932), the All American would become one of the designs to widely expand its use, leading its wider use by school districts and school bus operators throughout the United States and Canada. Along with the Blue Bird Conventional (and the later Blue Bird Vision), many Blue Bird body designs would share design elements with the All American, including the TC/2000, TC/1000, APC and CS commercial buses, and Wanderlodge recreational vehicle.

=== 1950s ===
In 1950, A.L. Luce retired from daily operations of Blue Bird, with operations of the company handled by his three sons; A.L. &quot;Buddy&quot; Luce Jr. became company president and general manager; George Luce oversaw engineering and Joseph Luce overseeing production and assembly. The same year, the company began assembly of a second product line, as the All American entered full-scale production. In an effort to guarantee year-round demand, Blue Bird turned to exports for its buses, entering Central America and South America.

During the late 1950s, several changes were made to the body design of Blue Bird buses. In 1957, the body underwent a complete redesign, including a higher roofline and flatter body sides; with several revisions, the current Blue Bird Vision and All American continue to use this body. As an option, a &quot;high-headroom&quot; body was introduced, raising interior height to 77 inches.

===1960s===
At the beginning of the 1960s, Blue Bird stood as the fourth-largest manufacturer of school buses in the United States. To accommodate the added demand, the Luce brothers added several production facilities to supplement the Fort Valley, Georgia plant. In 1958, Blue Bird Canada was opened in Brantford, Ontario. In 1962, Blue Bird Midwest was opened in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.

At the beginning of the decade, Blue Bird introduced its roofline brand emblem, becoming the first bus manufacturer to do so. In 1962, Blue Bird introduced a panoramic windshield design, used on the All American through 2013 (and still on use on the Vision). In the early 1960s, Blue Bird introduced its long-running company slogan: &quot;Your Children&#x27;s Safety is Our Business&quot;, appearing in company advertising (and inside bus bodies) into the 1990s.

Company founder A.L. Luce died in 1962. Shortly after, the three Luce sons sought to diversify the company product line, fearing that demand for school bus production would eventually recede; while the baby boom generation affected student populations, the generation (as a whole) would complete high school shortly after 1980.

In 1965, the company launched bus assembly outside of North America for the first time, opening Blue Bird Central America in Guatemala. While assembling the bodies of the Conventional and All American, Blue Bird Central America lowered production and maintenance costs by using locally sourced chassis (from Mercedes-Benz, Hino, Nissan Diesel, and Toyota) in place of sharing components from the United States.

==== Wanderlodge ====


In 1963, the first major Blue Bird venture outside of school buses made its debut. Named the Blue Bird Transit Home (re-branded as Wanderlodge in 1968), it was a $12,000 luxury recreational vehicle based on the All American type. Using the heavy-duty frame and all-steel body to its advantage, the vehicle was marketed as higher-quality than other RVs of the time; the interior was largely built to order. For over 25 years of production, the Wanderlodge developed a loyal customer base, including celebrities and heads of state among their owners.

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, Blue Bird further diversified its product line, entering the transit bus segment. In 1976, the City Bird was introduced as a rear-engine variant of the All American developed for smaller mass-transit routes.

During the decade, the design of small school buses evolved into a dedicated vehicle (away from adaptations of automobiles). While designs based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company, the 1975 Micro Bird introduced several key features retained by van-based buses today. Along with a full-height entry door, the Micro Bird added windows forward of the entry door (to aid loading-zone visibility). The 1977 Mini Bird used the chassis of the GM P30 stepvan; slightly larger than the Micro Bird, the model line shared the body width of the full-size Conventional and All American.

During the 1970s, Blue Bird introduced the &quot;Handy Bus&quot; option package. Available on any model line from the Micro Bird to the All American, the Handy Bus option featured a wheelchair lift and side door and onboard wheelchair accommodations.

=== 1980s ===

By 1980, Blue Bird would become the highest-volume school bus manufacturer in the United States, with over 20 times the yearly sales of only two decades prior. Despite the added presence of the company, as an entire industry, school bus manufacturing was in turmoil due to several factors. While the volatile economy of the time was impossible to foresee, many of the early 1960s predictions of the Luce brothers had largely come true. By the early 1980s, the baby-boom generation had completed its secondary education, leveling off student population growth. No longer provided with a supplemental source of demand, the manufacturing segment was becoming saturated by the end of the 1970s. From 1979 to 1982, three of the six largest school bus manufacturers—Carpenter, Superior, and Ward—would file for bankruptcy.

To preserve sales, Blue Bird began the use of financing for bus acquisitions in 1984. The unprecedented strategy proved successful, with sales increasing further in the mid-1980s; as the highest-selling bus manufacturer, nearly one out of every three new school buses was a Blue Bird.

While the 1980s would prove successful for Blue Bird in school bus production, the company saw mixed results in other segments. After 10 years of weak sales, the Blue Bird City Bird was discontinued in 1986. Despite volatile sales in recreational vehicles, the Wanderlodge remained successful, accounting for nearly one in five Blue Bird vehicles sold. To better compete with more modern designs, Blue Bird began to differentiate the Wanderlodge from the All American school bus with several exterior restylings in the late 1980s. In 1988 a wide version of the Wanderlodge was introduced—wider than the school bus bodies. The final Wanderlodge to share a body and chassis with the All American was produced in 1990.

During the end of the 1980s, the Blue Bird product line saw several changes. While the All American had been offered in a rear-engine configuration since 1961, a version with a company-sourced chassis was first introduced in 1988. Introduced in late 1987, the TC/2000 (see below) became the first new full-size Blue Bird bus in nearly 30 years. As a running change during 1989 production, Blue Bird introduced a new generation of the All American (redesigned for the first time since 1957). Alongside a redesigned drivers&#x27; compartment, the All American received a new set of engine offerings.

==== Management changes ====
From its founding in 1932 until the middle of the 1980s, the operations of Blue Bird were overseen either by A.L. Luce or his three sons. In 1984, the board of directors was expanded outside of the family for the first time; in 1986, the company hired Paul Glaske, president of Marathon LeTourneau (a Texas-based heavy equipment manufacturer). Glaske oversaw day-to-day operations of the company, while the sons of Buddy and Joseph Luce worked elsewhere in company management.

==== TC/2000 ====
In 1987, Blue Bird introduced the TC/2000, adding a second transit-style school bus product line. Developed as a competitor to the Wayne Lifestar, the model was marketed to secure purchases from operators of large bus fleets, priced closely to conventional-style buses.

In line with the Blue Bird All American, the TC/2000 was manufactured with a Blue Bird-produced chassis; initially produced only as a front-engine bus, a rear-engine configuration was introduced in 1991. To reduce manufacturing costs, the model line was offered with a single diesel engine and automatic transmission configuration and a simplified drivers&#x27; compartment.

The TC/2000 achieved success in its market segment; by 1990, nearly one in ten new school buses sold in the United States was a TC/2000.

=== 1990s ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, Blue Bird had secured its position as the highest-volume school bus manufacturer; following the launch of the TC/2000, the company held nearly a 50% market share. After nearly six decades as a family-run company, in 1991, the Luce family decided to put Blue Bird Body Company up for sale. After showing the company to potential buyers through much of 1991, six buyers offered bids. For $397 million, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners purchased an 82% share of Blue Bird in November 1991, changing the name from Blue Bird Body Company to Blue Bird Corporation. Under the terms of the sale, the remaining 18% of the company was equally distributed between Paul Glaske and 14 management employees selected by the Luce family; Buddy and Joseph Luce retired while the rest of the management team was retained.

During the early 1990s, following the success of its school bus product lines, Blue Bird commenced efforts to further diversify its product lines. As a replacement for the City Bird, in 1992, Blue Bird launched the Blue Bird Q-Bus, designed for mass-transit and charter applications. In contrast to the City Bird, the Q-Bus shared no design commonality with a Blue Bird school bus. In addition to the Q-Bus, the APC (All-Purpose Coach) and CS (Commercial Series) were introduced, as commercial buses based on the bodies of the All American and TC/2000; a &quot;shell&quot; version was sold for upfitters as well.

To better compete with more modern designs of luxury recreational vehicles, Blue Bird began to update the design of the Wanderlodge. Following the 1988 introduction of the 102&quot; wide body, the Wanderlodge line was redesigned entirely for 1991 (effectively sharing only Blue Bird emblems with the All American). In 1994, a second version of the Wanderlodge was introduced, as the Wanderlodge BMC debuted. To expand its availability, the Wanderlodge BMC was produced using a chassis from Spartan Motors; a Blue Bird QMC commercial variant was introduced, designed as a mobile workstation. In 1997, Blue Bird expanded into the passenger motorcoach segment, introducing the LTC-40 (Luxury Touring Coach); for 1998, the Wanderlodge LX/LXi were introduced, adapting the LTC body.

In an effort to match demand for its product lines, Blue Bird made several changes to its production facilities, closing Blue Bird East in (in Virginia) in 1992 and opening Blue Bird de Mexico (in Monterrey, Nuevo León) in 1995.

After few major changes to its school bus product lines through the 1990s, in 1999, the Blue Bird All American underwent its second redesign in 10 years. In order to increase forward visibility, the All American was given an all-new chassis (positioning the engine lower), adopting the larger windshield of the TC/2000, and redesigned dashboard and control panels (later used in the TC/2000).

During the late 1990s, Blue Bird Corporation would undergo the first of several ownership changes. After increasing sales each year throughout the second half of the 1990s, Blue Bird was acquired from Merrill Lynch Capital Partners by Henlys Group PLC for $428 million (with Henlys also paying $237 million of Blue Bird company debt). At the time, Henlys sought to expand its operations in North America, with 10% of the company owned by Volvo Group.

==== Joint ventures ====

During the 1990s, Blue Bird would enter into several joint ventures as part of its school bus production, for both small and full-size school buses.

In an effort to supplement the Blue Bird Micro Bird, in 1992, Blue Bird entered into a supply agreement with Quebec-based bus manufacturer Girardin Minibus to supply Blue Birds with Girardin-produced MB-II/MB-IV school buses (branded as Blue Birds) on cutaway van chassis. While configured similar to the Micro Bird, the &quot;Blue Bird MB-II/IV by Girardin&quot; allowed Blue Bird to offer an updated body design; at the time, Girardin was the sole manufacturer to produce a full cutaway body for single rear-wheel van chassis. The MB-II and MB-IV were sold by Blue Bird until 1999, when they adopted the Girardin branding.

Coinciding with the 1991 redesign of the General Motors medium-duty truck line, General Motors entered into a 10-year supply agreement with Blue Bird, starting early in 1992, as a 1993 model. Under the agreement, the Chevrolet/GMC B7 would only be sold to Blue Bird. Blue Bird offered a choice of other cowled chassis (Ford B700/B800, International 3700, 3800, and later Freightliner FS-65). The CV200 was produced through 2002. The 2002s were considered 2003 models.

==== Environmentally friendly buses ====
In place of bringing all-new product lines to production, during the 1990s, Blue Bird explored several methods of reducing the environmental impact of school buses, with several methods reaching production. In 1991, Blue Bird developed the first school bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), an All American Rear Engine. In 1995, Blue Bird began a collaboration with John Deere to produce school buses with CNG engines, lasting into the 2000s; along with the All American, CNG engines were produced for the TC/2000.

In 1996, Blue Bird debuted the &quot;Envirobus 2000&quot; concept school bus. Derived loosely from the Q-Bus, the Envirobus served loosely as a testbed for safety-related technology along with the viability of CNG-powered school buses.

Along with alternative-fuel buses, Blue Bird became the first school bus manufacturer to develop fully electric school buses; during the 1990s, technology limited its development to the prototype stage. In 1994, the company developed a battery-powered school bus in an effort with Westinghouse Electronic Systems for a school district in California. In 1996, Blue Bird collaborated with Electrosource, Inc in an effort to design a battery system intended for buses.

===2000s===


While the late 1990s were calmer than the late 1970s for the school bus industry, it still remained a time of relative turmoil for school bus manufacturers; this would carry into the 2000s. Several school bus manufacturers underwent acquisition or changed hands (AmTran and Thomas Built Buses); by 2001, several others (Crown Coach, Carpenter, Gillig, Wayne) would end school bus production forever. Instead of being family-run companies, school bus manufacturers were now owned by larger companies with ties to truck manufacturing. For Blue Bird, a large stake of the company was owned by the Volvo Group, the largest bus manufacturer in the world. However, during the early 2000s, due to financial difficulties of its other parent company, Blue Bird was sold from Henlys in 2004. In 2006, Blue Bird was acquired through a bankruptcy filing by Cerberus Capital Management. Looking to develop its entries in the transportation sector, Blue Bird was paired with North American Bus Industries (NABI) and Optima Bus Corporation by Cerberus.

At the beginning of the 2000s, Blue Bird sought to modernize its aging transit bus line; the Q-Bus was nearly a decade old and the CS and APC coaches were essentially commercial versions of the All American and TC/2000 school buses. For 2002, the 96-inch wide Q-Bus was replaced by the 102-inch wide Xcel102 and the CS and APC lines were retired. In 2003, the company entered the low-floor segment with the introduction of the UltraLF and UltraLMB.

As the number of full-size school bus manufacturers had been cut from seven to three from 1990 to 2000, Blue Bird began on making its school bus products more competitive during the early part of the decade. Following the substantial update of the All American in 1999, Blue Bird discontinued the slow-selling TC/1000 in 2001 and consolidated the TC/2000 with the All American early in 2004.

However, the largest change came in 2003, as Blue Bird sought to replace the CV200. While initially developed to use the Ford F-650 Super Duty chassis, the Vision underwent a major change before its release. In a major break from precedent, Blue Bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis, instead developing its own version from the ground up. While the Vision used the same bus body as the long-running Conventional, engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility.

As part of its acquisition by Cerberus, Blue Bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production, its largest market. In 2007, the Xcel102 was discontinued and the low-floor UltraLF/LMB product lines were added to NABI. In a controversial move, the rights to the Wanderlodge luxury motorhome were sold to Complete Coach Works; production ended in 2009.

In commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the construction the first Blue Bird bus and the centennial of the Model T Ford, the Luce family donated the restored vehicle to The Henry Ford Museum in 2008. Dubbed &quot;Blue Bird #1&quot;, it is the oldest known surviving school bus in the United States.

With resources dedicated solely towards school bus production, the Vision saw a major update for 2008. In addition to a new dashboard, it received a new cowl with larger headlights and grille. For 2009, the company expanded alternative-fuel options as it introduced a propane-fuel variant of the Vision; it was powered by a General Motors 8.1L V8. For 2010, the All American was given a complete update, marking some of the largest changes to the Blue Bird body design in over 50 years; along with a complete redesign of the roof, windshield, and rear entry, the interior received a ground-up redesign.

With the streamlining of bus production, the number of production facilities utilized by the company has been reduced. Blue Bird de Mexico was closed in 2001 and Blue Bird Midwest in Mount Pleasant, Iowa was closed in 2002. In 2010, Blue Bird North Georgia was closed, consolidating all bus production back to company headquarters in Fort Valley.

In October 2009, Blue Bird further streamlined its bus production as it entered into a second joint venture with Canadian school bus manufacturer Girardin Minibus. Dubbed &quot;Micro Bird, Inc.&quot;, all small bus production was consolidated at the Girardin facilities in Quebec, Canada; consequently, all Blue Bird production is now limited to full-size conventional and transit buses. The 2010 Micro Bird was the last Blue Bird bus to use a non-Blue Bird chassis.

===2010s===
Following the consolidation of Blue Bird production to the Vision and All American school buses (and vehicles derived from them), during the 2010s, a number of changes were phased in. In following with the popularity with the LPG/propane autogas version of the Blue Bird Vision bus, a version powered by a Ford V10 and equipped with a ROUSH CleanTech propane autogas fuel system was introduced in 2011 (as the original General Motors V8 engines were no longer in production); in addition, the Vision received a dashboard and steering column shared with the All American.

In late 2012, Blue Bird unveiled a redesigned 2014 All American series (code-named the T3 Series), which would replace versions introduced in 1999 and 2008 produced concurrently. Distinguished by a redesigned (rounder) roof, the new All American has increased parts commonality with the Vision. In October 2013, the 2015 Vision was introduced. Along with clear-lens headlights and a new grille, propane-fueled versions gained the option of an extended-range 98-gallon fuel tank. Company owner Cerberus Capital sold off the majority of its transportation holdings, including NABI and Optima to Canadian bus builder New Flyer; Blue Bird remained under Cerberus ownership.

In late 2013, Blue Bird entered a different segment of school transportation as it introduced Blue Bird Connect™, a GPS-based fleet management software system co-developed with Synovia Solutions. While designed as an integrated system as an option for any Blue Blue school bus, Blue Bird Connect™ was also intended for retrofit to existing fleets of school buses as well, regardless of brand.

Though produced by Girardin under the Micro Bird joint venture, in late 2014, the company introduced the Micro Bird T-Series, a Girardin-bodied Type A school bus; it is the first school bus body ever produced for the Ford Transit in North America. Largely due to the Ford-derived chassis design, Blue Bird predicts a 20% fuel economy increase over its E-Series MB/G5 counterpart. In 2014, Blue Bird introduced the Sigma, an all-new transit bus. While developed solely for export, the Sigma derived its chassis configuration and drivetrain from the All American.

In September 2014, the ownership of Blue Bird underwent another transition. Texas-based venture capital firm Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corporation purchased a $255 million stake of the company from Cerberus affiliate The Traxis Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBF 9/22/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the acquisition, Cerberus/Traxis would retain majority ownership; the Blue Bird leadership team remained in place. Although Cerberus remains the majority owner of Blue Bird with a 58% share of the company, in late February 2015, Blue Bird became the first stand-alone school bus manufacturer to become publicly traded on NASDAQ.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBF 2/26/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, Blue Bird ranked as the leading provider of propane autogas powered school buses through a partnership with ROUSH CleanTech, which provides propane autogas fuel systems for the buses. At this time, the Propane Education &amp; Research Council (PERC) estimated that between school districts and private fleets, 11,000 propane school buses had been purchased in the United States.

In September 2015, Blue Bird further expanded its non-diesel fuel offerings as the company introduced a gasoline-fueled variant of the Vision, starting with 2016 production The first gasoline-fueled full-size school bus since the discontinuation of the 2002 Blue Bird CV200, it is powered by the same Ford V10 used by the propane-fueled variant of the Vision. At the end of 2018, Blue Bird produced the 5,000th gasoline-powered version of the Vision.

In January 2017, Blue Bird announced it would begin development of a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) school bus with the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. This development work is being supported by a $4.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as additional support from other entities, bringing together just over $9 million in funds. The project will result in eight ZEV V2G school buses being deployed in California. After unveiling fully electric versions of the Micro Bird G5 and All American in late 2017, Blue Bird delivered its first production electric school buses in September 2018.

=== 2020s ===
On May 10, 2022, Bluebird announced its entry into a new commercial product line. At the Expo Trade Center, Bluebird unveiled a Class 5 and Class 6 EV Truck chassis that was intended for use on a delivery truck body. This was produced in collaboration with Lightning eMotors, a Colorado-based manufacturer of electric powertrains and complete zero-emission vehicle solutions. Bluebird plans to launch production of its Class 5-6 EV chassis in late 2023 at its manufacturing facility in Fort Valley, Georgia.

In May 2023, workers at Blue Bird&#x27;s main Fort Valley factory voted in favor of a unionization drive by the United Steelworkers by a 697–435 margin.

==Products==
In addition to school, activity, and commercial applications, Blue Bird buses have been custom-built for unique applications such as bloodmobiles, mobile libraries, and public safety command centers.

===School buses===


===Other vehicles===

====Exports====
Blue Bird have also built a number of buses for the United Kingdom market, with 62 Blue Bird buses being exported to the UK between 1992 and 2007. Most of the vehicles exported were right hand drive variants of the Blue Bird All American and the Blue Bird Q-Bus. Various local councils, such as Staffordshire County Council and West Sussex County Council, imported a large number of Blue Bird school buses for their own school routes; FirstGroup were the largest private customer in the United Kingdom, ordering eighteen All Americans in 2002.

In addition to school buses, a single low-floor city bus, known as the Blue Bird LFCC9, was built in late 2003. The 29-seater midibus, registered NK53TJV, received the then-popular Plaxton Pointer 2 bodywork and entered service with Arriva North East.

===Prototypes===

===Company timeline===
==Manufacturing and assembly==
Traditionally, school buses such as those produced by Blue Bird consist of components purchased from various &quot;outside&quot; suppliers and parts which are manufactured &quot;in-house&quot; to the company&#x27;s specifications. These two categories of parts are then typically assembled into bodies which can be mounted onto chassis which have often been variations of those used in a myriad of truck applications. Alongside its role of vehicle assembly, the Blue Bird facility in Fort Valley, Georgia, also manufactured parts used for all company facilities to produce vehicles. Blue Bird Wanderlodges were manufactured in an adjacent facility in Fort Valley, including Wanderlodge Wayside Park, a tree-shaded motor home park to accommodate Wanderlodges visiting for service.

Blue Bird currently operates its Fort Valley manufacturing facility as its sole point of assembly; Micro Birds are assembled in the Girardin factory in Drummondville, Quebec, Canada. In the past, the company held four factories (and the Wanderlodge factory) in the United States, two facilities in Canada (separate from Girardin), one in Mexico, and one in Guatemala. In the 1980s, Blue Bird exited production in Central America; during the 2000s, the company gradually wound down its number of factories as the company centralized production and consolidated its model lines to school buses and their derivatives. In 2010, Blue Bird North Georgia (LaFayette, Georgia) was closed.


==Branding==
===Company name===
The exact origin of the Blue Bird company name is unknown; several theories are known to exist. Most commonly, A.L. Luce was perceived to have been hesitant about using the family surname for the company out of fears of mispronunciation (i.e., a Luce bus = &quot;loose bus&quot;).

In another version, when showing a blue and yellow demonstrator unit to school officials, Luce overheard the positive reception of school children who had seen the bus, who nicknamed it &quot;a pretty blue bird&quot;, and the name was chosen for the company. Conversely, since the end of the 1930s, yellow would become the exterior color associated with American-manufactured school buses.

===Roof emblem===
The Blue Bird company emblem is a silhouette profile of the company namesake bluebird; the design has been painted on the roof on many of its buses since the beginning of the 1960s. Later in the decade, the company began to combine the emblem with a stripe painted on the roof of the bus, known as a &quot;streamer&quot;. On school buses, the emblem and streamers are black (if specifications allow for their use); the streamer is also offered as an option. On non-school buses, the emblem and streamer are also offered in various colors, coordinated to the design of the bus.

The combination of roof emblems and streamers would come into use by other school manufacturers as a design feature; the latter would become most closely associated with Blue Bird and its roof emblem.

In 2013, the roof streamer was redesigned for the first time. To simplify manufacturing, the roof-length streamer was replaced by a single design shared across Blue Bird and Micro Bird buses (introduced for 2014 production), with three versions, distinguished by fuel type. Diesel-fuel buses retained the previous black design, with propane-fuel vehicles receiving a green emblem and streamer; the gasoline-fuel Vision received a blue-colored design.

For 2019 production, Blue Bird retired the roof streamer design. As the company introduced electric-powered buses for 2020, an electric cord-style streamer was introduced with a green Blue Bird emblem (distinguishing it from propane-fuel buses).

<text>U.S. Route 206 (US 206) is a north–south U.S. highway in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, United States. Only about a of its length is in Pennsylvania; the Milford–Montague Toll Bridge carries it over the Delaware River into New Jersey, where it connects to the remainder of the route. Its southern terminus is at an intersection of White Horse Pike (US 30) and Bellevue Avenue (Route 54) in Hammonton. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at an intersection of US 209 near Milford, Pennsylvania; some sources and signs show an overlap with US 209 to end at its parent route US 6. For much of its length, US 206 is a rural two-lane undivided road that passes through the Pine Barrens, agricultural areas, and the Appalachian Mountains of Northwestern New Jersey, with some urban and suburban areas. The route connects several cities and towns, including Bordentown, Trenton, Princeton, Somerville, Roxbury, Netcong, and Newton.

What is now US 206 in New Jersey was designated as part of several state routes prior to 1927, including pre-1927 Route 2 between Bordentown and Trenton in 1916, pre-1927 Route 13 between Trenton and Princeton in 1917, and pre-1927 Route 16 between Princeton and Bedminster in 1921. The current routing along pre-1927 Route 2 became a part of US 130 in 1926. In 1927, current US 206 became Route 39 between Hammonton and White Horse, Route 37 between White Horse and Trenton, Route 27 between Trenton and Princeton, Route 31 between Princeton and Newton, and Route S31 between Newton and the Delaware River. In the later 1930s, US 206 was designated to connect US 30 in Hammonton north to US 6 and US 209 in Milford; the northern terminus was moved to its current location in the 1940s. The state highways running concurrent with US 206 in New Jersey were removed in 1953. In the 1960s, two separate freeways were proposed for US 206 but never built. The first freeway was to connect Hammonton south along the Route 54 corridor toward Route 55 and the planned Route 60 in Vineland and Millville. The other US 206 freeway was planned in northwestern New Jersey, connecting I-80 in Netcong north to Montague Township. Construction began for a bypass of US 206 around Hillsborough in 2010 and was completed in 2021. The New Jersey Department of Transportation widened the route in Byram Township to alleviate congestion, with completion in 2013.

==== Atlantic and Burlington counties ====
US 206 begins at the intersection of White Horse Pike (US 30) in Hammonton in Atlantic County, heading north-northeast on the two-lane, undivided highway. South of this intersection, the road continues as Route 54, known as Bellevue Avenue. From its southern terminus, US 206 runs through farmland, which eventually gives way to the heavily forested Pine Barrens. Within this area, the route continues through the Wharton State Forest. Here, the road comes to the intersection of Chew Road (CR 536).

US 206 continues into Shamong Township, Burlington County, passing through more of the Pine Barrens. In Shamong Township, the road makes a turn to the north and crosses an abandoned railroad line before it passes by Atsion Lake. After running northwest, CR 541 splits to the left on Stokes Road. After this intersection, US 206 heads north out of Wharton State Forest and into more agricultural areas. At the intersection of Carranza Road (CR 648), US 206 briefly joins CR 648 and splits from US 206 by turning north-northeast on Old Indian Mills Road. the route briefly widens into a four-lane undivided road before narrowing back to two lanes. Upon intersecting with Tuckerton Road (CR 622), US 206 enters Tabernacle. Here, Medford Lakes Road (CR 532) crosses the route at a signalized intersection. Following the intersection of Medford Lakes Road (CR 532), residential development increases along the route as it continues into Southampton. US 206 becomes a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes as it comes to the Red Lion Circle with Route 70. Past the Red Lion Circle, the route becomes two lanes again and passes more rural surroundings with some development. US 206 comes to the intersection of Route 38 and South Pemberton Road (CR 530).

A short distance after the intersection of Route 38 and South Pemberton Road (CR 530), the route becomes the border between Eastampton to the west and Southampton to the east before running between Eastampton and Pemberton Township. Along this portion, it passes through Ewansville. Continuing entirely into Springfield Township, the route crosses the intersection of Monmouth Road (CR 537). Past this intersection, US 206 widens into a four-lane undivided road. The route briefly gains a wide painted median before crossing the Assicunk Creek into Mansfield Township In Mansfield Township, US 206 becomes a divided highway as it bypasses the community of Columbus to the west, with CR 690 continuing through Columbus. On the bypass of Columbus, the route has an interchange with CR 543.
Past Columbus, US 206 becomes undivided again, with residential development increasing. It becomes a divided highway again and merges with the northern terminus of Route 68, the main access road to the Fort Dix entity of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, at a directional intersection. After this intersection, US 206 enters Bordentown Township and reaches an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in a commercial area. Following this interchange, the route intersects with Farnsworth Avenue/Georgetown Road (CR 545). A short distance later, US 206 merges into US 130 at a directional interchange to form a concurrency. The two roads continue north on a six-lane divided highway, briefly entering the eastern edge of Bordentown at the intersection of Crosswicks Street/Crosswicks Road (CR 528). Back in Bordentown Township, US 130 and US 206 split at another directional interchange. Past US 130, US 206 crosses under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Robbinsville Industrial Track railroad line and heads through development as a four-lane divided highway, making a slight northwest bend before resuming north.

==== Mercer County ====
US 206 crosses the Crosswicks Creek and enters Hamilton, Mercer County. Immediately after the Crosswicks Creek, there is an interchange with I-195. Past I-195, the route reaches the White Horse Circle, where it intersects with South Broad Street (CR 524) and White Horse Avenue (CR 533). At this point, US 206 turns west-northwest to run along four-lane divided locally maintained South Broad Street. Passing through White Horse, the road briefly becomes five lanes with a center left-turn lane before becoming a four-lane divided highway again as it crosses over I-295 without an interchange. Running into more urban areas of development, the route enters Trenton at the crossing the intersection of Lalor Street (CR 650) After entering Trenton, US 206 narrows into a two-lane undivided street. As the road heads toward downtown Trenton, it crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line immediately before interchanging with Route 129. From here, the road turns more to the northwest with four lanes and passes by the CURE Insurance Arena before crossing over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line and US 1 without an interchange simultaneously. US 206 enters the commercial downtown area, narrowing back to two lanes before reaching Warren Street, where US 206 splits into a one-way pair following Broad Street northbound and Warren Street southbound.
This one–way pairing, which carries two lanes in each direction, curves north and continues through Downtown Trenton. At the Trenton Battle Monument, the road reaches an intersection of Pennington Avenue (Route 31) and US 206 turns northeast onto another one-way pairing that follows Brunswick Avenue northbound and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard southbound, with each road being two-way but only carrying one direction of US 206. The road continues through neighborhoods, with northbound US 206 passing to the west of Capital Health Regional Medical Center and southbound US 206 forming the border between Ewing to the northwest and Trenton to the southeast as a county-maintained road at the intersection of Calhoun Street. At this point, southbound US 206 becomes concurrent with CR 583. At the intersection of Spruce Street, northbound US 206 becomes the border between Lawrence and Trenton, becoming state-maintained, while southbound US 206/CR 583 fully crosses into Lawrence. Northbound US 206 widens into a four-lane divided highway as it comes to the Brunswick Circle with Business US 1. At this point, Business US 1 continues northeast on Brunswick Pike while northbound US 206 heads north as a two-lane undivided road called Lawrence Road. CR 645 links the Brunswick Circle to southbound US 206/CR 583.

At this point, both directions of US 206 are in Lawrence and rejoin, with US 206 continuing north as a two-lane undivided road and CR 583 heading to the northeast. US 206 continues through suburban residential areas within Lawrence. The route makes a turn to the northeast before heading north again and passing to the east of Rider University. A short distance later, the road has a cloverleaf interchange with I-295 prior to an intersection of Pennington-Lawrenceville Road/Franklin Corner Road (CR 546). In this area, US 206 is briefly a two-lane divided highway. Past Pennington-Lawrenceville Road/Franklin Corner Road (CR 546), the route becomes two-lane undivided Main Street and heads north-northeast through Lawrenceville, passing development and the mile-long campus of The Lawrenceville School. Upon leaving Lawrenceville, US 206 turns more to the east through rural surroundings and intersects with Carter Road (CR 569). US 206 forms a short concurrency with CR 569 and splits from US 206 by turning east on Fackler Road. From this point, the route continues northeast and enters Princeton.
In Princeton, CR 533 intersects US 206, and the two routes form a concurrency. The road becomes Stockton Street, passing by the Drumthwacket Governor&#x27;s mansion. US 206 turns north onto Bayard Lane, with Route 27 continuing northeast into Downtown Princeton on Nassau Street, which provides access to Princeton University through Downtown Princeton. The stretch from Lawrenceville until the intersection of Nassau Street in Princeton is part of the King&#x27;s Highway Historic District. Bayard Lane carries the route past more wooded developed areas, eventually curving northeast through a park. Here, US 206 becomes unnamed and turns north again. Continuing to the north, the amount of development adjacent to the road decreases.

==== Somerset County ====
US 206 enters Montgomery in Somerset County. In Montgomery Township, the route runs to the east of Princeton Airport and crosses the intersection of Georgetown-Franklin Turnpike/Washington Street (CR 518). Following this intersection, CR 533 splits from US 206 by heading northeast on Bridgepoint Road, and US 206 continues north-northwest through a mix of suburban and rural areas. The road passes through the community of Harlingen before widening to four lanes and reaching Belle Mead. In this area, US 206 passes over CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision railroad line before making a turn to the northeast and then to the north, narrowing back to two lanes. The road enters Hillsborough. US 206 intersects with US 206 Bypass at its southern end and Mountain View Road. The road continues into residential and commercial areas of Hillsborough. It comes to the intersection of Amwell Road (CR 514) in this area.

Past the intersection of Amwell Road (CR 514), US 206 makes a curve northeast before heading east to intersect with the northern end of US 206 Bypass, where it turns north. Leaving the center of Hillsborough, the road runs northeast past more wooded areas as it crosses under Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Lehigh Line. The route passes more development as it widens into a four lane divided highway with jughandles, turning to the north and passing the former Duke Gardens. US 206 briefly becomes six lanes wide at the intersection of Dukes Parkway East (CR 608) before narrowing back to four lanes as it crosses the Raritan River into Somerville. In Somerville, the road runs northwest parallel to the Raritan River prior to turning north into commercial areas and entering Raritan. US 206 runs under NJ Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line before making a turn to the north-northwest.
US 206 comes to the modified Somerville Circle, where it meets US 202 and Route 28. At this modified traffic circle, US 206 and Route 28 run through it while US 202 passes over it with ramp access. US 206 forms a concurrency with US 202 at this point and the two routes continue north into Bridgewater, briefly entering Somerville. The two routes reenters Bridgewater and becomes a four-lane freeway an interchange with US 22 and heads north with the Bridgewater Commons shopping mall on the east side of the road and the Somerset Corporate Center on the west side of the road. An interchange with Commons Way provides access to both these places. Past Commons Way, the road passes under Garrettson Road and comes to an interchange with I-287 that also provides access to I-78. Past the I-287 interchange, US 202/206 continue north as a two-lane surface road past suburban areas. The road crosses Chambers Brook into Bedminster, where it soon passes under I-78. Shortly after I-78, it becomes into a four-lane expressway with a jersey barrier. US 202/206 come to another interchange with I-287, pass over the North Branch of the Raritan River, and come to an intersection where the two routes split.

After the US 202 split, US 206 continues north as a four-lane arterial road through commercial areas, with the grass median becoming replaced by a painted median as it comes to the intersection of Lamington Road (CR 523) in Downtown Bedminster. Following this intersection, the route narrows into a two-lane surface road that runs through less development. US 206 enters Peapack-Gladstone, where it runs a short distance to the west of NJ Transit&#x27;s Gladstone Branch. In Peapack-Gladstone, the road briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway as it has a trumpet interchange with Pfizer Way, a road that provides access to a Pfizer facility. Past this point, US 206 becomes a two-lane surface road that runs northwest through rural areas, with Pottersville Road (CR 512) crossing the road. Just after this intersection, the route enters Bedminster again, turning to the north.

==== Morris County ====

The route continues north into Chester Township, Morris County. In Chester Township, US 206 passes through forested areas, with the northbound direction briefly gaining a second lane. As the road comes into Chester, it widens to four lanes and passes shopping areas including the Streets of Chester. In the center of Chester, the route crosses the intersection of West Main Street/Main Street (CR 513). Past this intersection, US 206 continues into woodland development, with the northbound direction narrowing back into one lane as the route heads back into Chester Township. The road narrows back to two total lanes as it enters more rural surroundings, coming into Mount Olive. Further north, residential development near the road starts to increase. As US 206 reaches an intersection of Flanders-Bartley Road (CR 613), the surroundings becomes commercial before the route passes under Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s High Bridge Branch. After this area, the road turns north-northeast and runs through forested areas as a three lane road with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane, eventually entering Roxbury.
Business in the area of the road increase before US 206 widens to four total lanes and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-80 and the southern terminus of Route 183. At this point, the road continues north into Netcong as Route 183 while US 206 heads west along I-80, a six-lane freeway that continues into Mount Olive. The freeway continues northwest, running through a small corner of Netcong before coming back into Mount Olive and interchanging with US 46. Immediately after US 46, the highway passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line before turning north and reaching a trumpet interchange where US 206 splits from I-80. Following this split, US 206 is a four-lane freeway that heads northeast, crossing under Waterloo Valley Road and an abandoned railroad line before coming to an interchange with International Drive.

==== Sussex County ====

After the interchange with International Drive, US 206 crosses the Musconetcong River and enters Stanhope, Sussex County. Immediately following the river crossing, the freeway merges with the northern terminus of Route 183 at an interchange on the border between Byram Township to the west and Stanhope to the east. Past Route 183, US 206 continues north as a four-lane divided surface road past development, fully entering Stanhope again before crossing into Byram Township. Upon entering Byram Township, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road. Upon turning northwest, the surroundings become more forested as US 206 crosses a mountain, with the northbound direction gaining a second lane for a distance. There are a few businesses along the road as it runs north past wooded areas near Cranberry Lake and Panther Lake. The route continues into Andover, where it becomes Main Street and passes under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off and intersects with Brighton Avenue (CR 517). US 206 forms a brief concurrency with CR 517 in the commercial downtown area and splits from US 206 by turning east-northeast on Lenape Road. Past Lenape Road (CR 517), US 206 bends northwest and enters Andover Township. Here, the road runs back into forested areas, passing by Whites Pond and running near Kittatinny Valley State Park. After a curve to the north, the route enters a mix of development and rural areas, passing to the west of Newton Airport prior to entering Newton, where it becomes Woodside Avenue.

In Newton, the road is now known as Main Street and is lined by homes as it turns north. Upon reaching the downtown area, US 206 meets Route 94 and CR 519 at the Park Place Square. At this point, US 206 forms a concurrency with Route 94/CR 519 by turning northeast on Main Street, northwest on Spring Street, and all three routes run concurrent north on four-lane undivided Water Street for a short distance. CR 519 splits from the road by turning north on Mill Street while US 206 and Route 94 continue north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, crossing the Paulins Kill before coming to a shopping district as the road leaves Newton for Hampton Township. The road narrows back to two lanes and heads into areas of farmland. Route 94 splits from US 206 by making a right turn to continue east. After this intersection, US 206 turns northeast and enters Frankford Township. After crossing the Paulins Kill, Route 15 and Sussex Road (CR 565) end at a traffic light with US 206, with the route making a turn to the northwest on an unnamed road.

After this intersection, the route passes near Skylands Stadium before passing more farmland and reaching the community of Augusta. After Augusta, US 206 turns north-northwest through more rural areas before entering Branchville. Here, the route bypasses the center of town to the south as a four-lane divided highway before crossing the intersection of Newton Avenue (CR 519). Past Newton Avenue (CR 519), the median ends and US 206 continues to the west-northwest. After crossing back into Frankford Township, the route continues through forested areas. Turning more to the north, US 206 runs a short distance to the west of Culver&#x27;s Lake prior to intersecting with West Owassa Turnpike (CR 521). US 206 forms a concurrency with that route. US 206/CR 521 heads into Sandyston Township, where it crosses the Appalachian Trail at Culver’s Gap in the Kittatinny Mountain and passes through the mountainous Stokes State Forest.
After heading north with a three-lane stretch that has two southbound lanes and one northbound lane, the two-lane road reaches the intersection of Tuttles Corner-Dingmans Road (CR 560). After this intersection, the road leaves the state forest and continues through wooded areas with some commercial establishments. US 206/CR 521 reaches the community of Hainesville, where it passes through more agricultural surroundings with some development. Leaving Hainesville, the road continues into Montague Township. Near the community of Montague, CR 521 splits from US 206 by heading to the northeast on River Road. Meanwhile, US 206 turns to the northwest to run through wooded areas of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, where it comes to the Milford–Montague Toll Bridge over the Delaware River that is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.

=== Pennsylvania ===

After crossing the river on the Milford–Montague Toll Bridge, US 206 continues north into Dingman Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania. A short distance after the bridge, the route comes to a northbound toll plaza, where it becomes a two-lane divided highway. US 206 officially ends at an intersection of US 209 not far after the toll plaza for the bridge. Even though this intersection marks the end of US 206, a few signs show the route heading concurrent with US 209 to continue north to US 6 in Milford.

== History ==

What is now US 206 was part of several trails used by Lenape Native Americans: the Shamong Trail, later known as the Cape May Road, ran from what is now Crosswicks to Cape May; a trail running from Trenton through Crosswicks; the Assunpink Trail, later known as the Old Dutch Road, running from Trenton north to New Brunswick; and the Great Minisink Trail, running from Navesink through Netcong to Minisink Village in modern-day Montague Township. In 1801, the Morris Turnpike was legislated to run from Elizabeth through Netcong to Culver&#x27;s Gap. In 1804, the Union Turnpike was chartered to run from Morristown to the crossing at Dingman&#x27;s Ferry in Montague Township. In 1814, the Deckerton and Newton Turnpike branched from Newton through Deckerton, now Sussex, to New York state line. The Crosswicks and Trenton Turnpike was chartered in 1854; the road is now locally known as Broad Street, and was included in US 206 west of White Horse.

Prior to 1927, what is now US 206 in New Jersey was legislated as part of several routes. Between Bordentown and Trenton, the current alignment was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 2 in 1916. Between Trenton and Princeton, present-day US 206 became the southernmost part of pre-1927 Route 13 in 1917. In 1921, the current route from Princeton north to Bedminster was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 16.
After the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926, the route between Bordentown and Trenton became the northernmost part of US 130 while it became a part of US 1 between Trenton and Princeton. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, several state highways were legislated along present-day US 206. Route 39 followed the route from Hammonton to White Horse, while Route 37 was designated along it between White Horse and Trenton. From Trenton north to Princeton, pre-1927 Route 13 was replaced by Route 27. Present-day US 206 between Princeton and Newton became part of Route 31, a route that was to go past Newton to the New York state line near Unionville, while the portion north of Newton to the Delaware River in Montague Township became Route S31, a spur of Route 31. Another spur of Route 31, Route 31A, was legislated in 1941 to run from Route 31 in Princeton to Route 33 in Hightstown; only a small portion of this was built over the Northeast Corridor railroad line and is now Route 64.

US 206 was designated in the later 1930s, running from US 30 in Hammonton, New Jersey, north to US 6 and US 209 in Milford, Pennsylvania. By this time, the US 1 and US 130 designations were removed from the route onto new alignments. In 1938, US 206/Route 31 was designated to bypass Somerville, the former alignment was known as Route 177 from the 1960s until 1974. In the 1940s, US 206/Route 39 was realigned to the south of White Horse; the former alignment was known as Route 160 between the 1960s and the 1980s. Also in the 1940s, the northern terminus of US 206 was moved to its current location at US 209 in Dingman Township, Pennsylvania.

In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the state highways running concurrent with US 206 were removed. When US 206&#x27;s current alignment bypassing Columbus was built by the 1960s, the designation of Route 170 was given to the old alignment through Columbus; this road was turned over to Burlington County in the 1980s and is now CR 690. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for the US 206/Route 54 corridor, running from US 30 in Hammonton south to Route 55 and the proposed Route 60 near Vineland and Millville. Originally, a parkway had been planned in 1932 to serve the US 206 corridor between Hammonton and Trenton, but never materialized. The freeway between Vineland/Millville and Hammonton was to cost $47 million and was intended to provide a better route between the two areas than the existing two-lane roads. However, it was never built due to environmental and financial issues.
A freeway was also proposed for US 206 in northwestern New Jersey during the 1960s. In 1964, a Route 94 freeway was planned to follow US 206 between Netcong and Newton on its way to the proposed Route 23 freeway in Hamburg. The Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed a longer US 206 freeway that was to connect I-78 and I-287 in Bedminster north to Newton, incorporating the southern portion of the Route 94 proposal. This freeway was intended to relieve traffic on existing roads and provide access to recreation areas. By the late 1960s, the US 206 freeway would be planned by the New Jersey Department of Transportation to connect I-80 in Netcong north to Montague Township. This freeway was proposed to provide access to proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River that would have been built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project as well as alleviating traffic on the existing road. However, like the US 206 freeway proposal in Southern New Jersey, it was not built yet.

Since 1974, a bypass has been planned for the congested part of US 206 through Hillsborough. In 2002, the New Jersey Department of Transportation modified plans for the bypass. The bypass is to be mostly four lanes wide and run to the east of Hillsborough, with the southernmost portion only being two lanes; one interchange was planned with Amwell Road (CR 514). The road is to meet a Smart Growth goal by preserving land and eliminating two planned interchanges that would have increased congestion. In July 2009, it was announced that construction of the US 206 Bypass, which is projected to cost $148 million, would start in 2010. On June 24, 2010, a contract was given to Carbro Constructors Corporation to build the first phase between Amwell Road (CR 514) and Hillsborough Road. Construction on this portion, planned to cost $43 million, began on August 18, 2010, and opened on October 28, 2013. This section is currently designated US 206 Bypass. In early 2015, work on grading and utility relocation for the ends of the bypass was slated to be completed. Work on constructing the northern and southern ends of the US 206 Bypass of Hillsborough was originally planned to begin in early 2017. On April 13, 2018, construction began on the final phase to build the northern and southern ends of the bypass. The final phase of the US 206 Bypass, which is projected to cost $36.6 million and be funded through state and federal money, opened on June 5, 2021. The Hillsborough Bypass is named for Peter J. Biondi, a former Assemblyman and Hillsborough mayor who died in 2011.

US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes. This construction follows a decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening would violate the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed. The widening was done in order to eliminate backups on the previous two-lane stretch during rush hours. The project was slated to be finished in November 2013.

The New Jersey Department of Transportation is planning on widening the route in Hillsborough to four lanes and adding a concrete median from Doctors Way to Brown Avenue, where the four lane highway south of the Raritan River ends. This will replace the railroad overpass that is primarily blocking the widening project. The first half, from Doctors Way to Valley Road, will start in the summer of 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by fall 2022. The second half, from Valley Road to Brown Avenue will take place in 2022 and take 2 years to complete.

== Special routes ==
U.S. Route 206 Bypass (US 206 Byp.) is the designation for the Peter J. Biondi Bypass, a bypass of the section of US 206 through Hillsborough in Somerset County. The road begins at an at-grade intersection of US 206 and Mountain View Road and heads north as a two-lane divided road. First crossing over CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision railroad line, it curves to the north and comes to a signalized intersection of Hillsborough Road. Continuing north, the bypass passes through farmland and woodland with some nearby development, coming to bridges over Homestead Road and the Trenton Subdivision. The next intersection is a quadrant interchange with Amwell Road (CR 514). The connector road to Amwell Road (CR 514) is named Service Road through a direct ramp from CR 514 westbound to US 206 Bypass northbound exists. From here, the road becomes four lanes wide with a concrete barrier separating the carriageways. After passing under Hamilton Road, the bypass ends at a signalized intersection of US 206, which continues north.

The first section of the US 206 Bypass, in length and running from Hillsborough Road to Amwell Road (CR 514), opened on October 28, 2013. The full bypass opened on June 5, 2021.

<text>Output budgeting is a wide-ranging management technique introduced into the United States in the mid-1960s by Robert S. McNamara&#x27;s collaborator Charles J. Hitch, not always with ready cooperation with the administrators and based on the industrial management techniques of program budgeting. Subsequently, the technique has been introduced into other countries including Canada and the UK.

Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS) is in effect an integration of a number of techniques in a planning and budgeting process for identifying, costing and assigning a complexity of resources for establishing priorities and strategies in a major program and for forecasting costs, expenditure and achievements within the immediate financial year or over a longer period.

United States Department of Defense leaders use their Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System to link operational requirements with financial obligations. Department of Defense branches typically divides the process into plans, programs and budgets. While planning, programming, and budgeting continues throughout the year, PPBS dictates a sequential and an annual process culminating with annual Defense Plan, followed by a Defense Program, and then a Defense Budget.

PPBS requires Planners focus on operational requirements, programmers link the plans to a six-year financial plan (known as a Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP)), and budgeters prepare a two-year Congressional budget. While each step contains more detailed financial data, the two-year Congressional budget stems from the six-year Future Years Defense Plan, which is based on the even longer term Defense Plan.

<text>Alecia Beth Moore-Hart (née Moore; born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (stylized as ), is an American singer and songwriter. She is known for her rock-influenced pop songs, powerful contralto voice, and activism.

At the age of 15, Pink formed the short-lived girl group Choice, who signed with LaFace Records in 1995, although they disbanded without any major releases. Her first solo studio album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Take Me Home&quot; (2000) was released to commercial success and received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Produced by label boss Babyface and influenced by contemporary R&amp;B, the album spawned two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten singles: &quot;There You Go&quot; and &quot;Most Girls&quot;. Pink gained further recognition for her 2001 collaborative single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (with Christina Aguilera, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Mýa), which was released for the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack and peaked atop 13 international charts including the US, and earned her first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Pink shifted to pop rock with her second studio album, &quot;Missundaztood&quot; (2001), which sold over 13 million copies worldwide and yielded three top ten singles: &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Get Me&quot;, and &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot;.

Pink&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Try This&quot; (2003), sold significantly less than her second studio album, but earned her second Grammy for Best Female Rock Performance. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot; (2006) and &quot;Funhouse&quot; (2008), saw a commercial rebound and spawned the top-ten singles &quot;Who Knew&quot; and &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot;, as well as the number-one single &quot;So What&quot;. Pink&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The Truth About Love&quot; (2012), became her first to debut and peak at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned her fourth US number-one single, &quot;Just Give Me a Reason&quot; (featuring Nate Ruess). In 2014, Pink formed the collaborative folk duo You+Me with Canadian musician Dallas Green, whom released the album &quot;Rose Ave.&quot; in October of that year. Her following albums, &quot;Beautiful Trauma&quot; (2017) and &quot;Hurts 2B Human&quot; (2019), saw continued success and likewise debuted and peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with the former becoming the third best-selling album of that year worldwide. Her ninth and latest studio album, &quot;Trustfall&quot; (2023), peaked at number two on the chart.

Pink has been described as &quot;pop royalty&quot; for her distinctive raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence. She has sold over 135 million records worldwide (60 million albums and 75 million singles), making her one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. Pink is also the most-played female solo artist in the United Kingdom during the 21st century, while &quot;Billboard&quot; named Pink the Pop Songs Artist of the 2000s Decade. Her accolades include three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards (including Outstanding Contribution to Music), a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award) and two MTV Europe Music Awards. At the 63rd annual BMI Pop Awards, she received the BMI President&#x27;s Award for &quot;her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry&quot;, and she was honored with the People&#x27;s Champion Award, the IHeartRadio Music Award Icon Award. &quot;Billboard&quot; also named Pink the 2013 Woman of the Year at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Women in Music and honored her with the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Legend of Live. VH1 ranked her 10th on its list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.

==Early life and family==
Alecia Beth Moore was born on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to emergency room nurse Judith Moore (née Kugel) and insurance salesman James Moore. She has described herself as an &quot;Irish-German-Lithuanian Jew&quot;; her mother is Jewish. Although a healthy baby, she developed asthma that plagued her through her early years. When Pink was a toddler, her parents began having marital problems; they divorced before she was 10.

Pink was trained as a competitive gymnast between the ages 4 and 12. She attended Central Bucks High School West. In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a Battle of the Bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, &quot;Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome.&quot;

Pink began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was about 14 years old. She adopted her nickname &quot;Pink&quot; as her stage name around this time. She has given different explanations about how she came to be given that nickname, which she has had since she was a child. At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.

==Career==
===1995–1998: Career beginnings===
At 15, Pink and two other teenage girls, Sharon Flanagan and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&amp;B group Choice. A copy of their first song, &quot;Key to My Heart&quot;, was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. Afterward, he signed them to a recording contract with the label. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to the label&#x27;s then-headquarters in Atlanta to record an album. Despite it failing to see a commercial release, their song &quot;Key to My Heart&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Kazaam&quot;. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: &quot;go solo or go home.&quot; Choice subsequently disbanded in 1998.

===1999–2002: &quot;Can&#x27;t Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Missundaztood&quot;===
After Choice disbanded, Pink signed a recording contract with LaFace Records and began working on her first solo album with producers such as Babyface, Kandi Burruss and Tricky Stewart. Her first solo single, &quot;There You Go&quot;, was released in February 2000 and became her first top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number seven. Internationally, the song also charted inside the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In April, Pink&#x27;s album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Take Me Home&quot;, was released to commercial success. It peaked 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for two million units shipped in the U.S. It also went platinum in the United Kingdom and multi-platinum in Australia and Canada, while selling over four million copies worldwide. Critical reception to the album was mixed. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Most Girls&quot;, peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became her first chart-topping single in Australia. &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; was released as the final single and reached number 33 on the Hot 100.

Pink won the trophy for Female New Artist of the Year at the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. She was billed as a supporting act on the North American leg of NSYNC&#x27;s No Strings Attached Tour throughout the summer of 2000. In 2001, Pink, alongside singers Christina Aguilera and Mýa as well as rapper Lil&#x27; Kim, performed a cover of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. In the US it became the most successful airplay-only single in history, as well as Pink&#x27;s first No. 1 single. The success of the single was helped by its music video, which was popular on music channels and won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. The song won Pink&#x27;s first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

Tired of being marketed as another cookie cutter pop act, as well as eager both to be seen as a more serious songwriter and musician and to perform the type of music she wanted to, Pink took her sound in a new direction and sought more artistic or creative control during the recording of her second album, &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. She recruited Linda Perry, former singer of 4 Non Blondes (one of Pink&#x27;s favorite groups in her teenage years). Pink moved into Perry&#x27;s Los Angeles home where the pair spent several months writing songs for the album. Perry co-wrote and co-produced the album with Dallas Austin and Scott Storch, and according to VH1&#x27;s &quot;Driven&quot; program, Antonio &quot;LA&quot; Reid of LaFace Records was not initially content with the new music Pink was making. The album, named &quot;Missundaztood&quot; because of Pink&#x27;s belief that people had a wrong image of her, was released in November 2001.

&quot;Get the Party Started&quot; was released as the lead single and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also became a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, and Spain, as well as spending four weeks at the top of the European Hot 100 Singles chart. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, its music video won in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Dance Video. The album&#x27;s other singles—&quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Get Me&quot;, &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot;, and &quot;Family Portrait&quot;—were also radio and chart successes, with &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; becoming Pink&#x27;s second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. &quot;Missundaztood&quot; remains Pink&#x27;s best-selling record with over 13 million copies sold worldwide. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), &quot;Missundaztood&quot; was the eighth best-selling album of 2002 globally. Pink won a World Music Award for Best Selling American Pop/Rock Female Artist. She was also nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Grammy Awards. Faith Hill&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;Cry&quot;, features a song co-written by Pink and Perry (&quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Fly Away&quot;). In 2002, Pink headlined a tour of America, Europe and Australia, the Party Tour, as well as becoming a supporting act for Lenny Kravitz&#x27;s American tour. Pink was named the Top Female &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Artist of 2002.

===2003–2007: &quot;Try This&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot;===

In mid-2003, Pink contributed the song &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;, in which she had a cameo appearance as a motocross race ramp owner/promoter. Featuring electronic music artist William Orbit, it became Pink&#x27;s first single to miss the top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart, although it was a hit in Europe and in Australia. It was later included on non-US editions of Pink&#x27;s third album, &quot;Try This&quot;, which was released on November 11, 2003. Eight of the 13 tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid. Linda Perry was featured on the album as a writer and musician. Despite the album reaching the top ten on album charts in the US, in Canada, in the UK, and in Australia, sales were considerably lower than those of &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. However, it did go platinum in the US. The singles &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; did not reach the US top 40 but did reach the top ten in other countries, and &quot;Last to Know&quot; was released as a single outside North America. &quot;Trouble&quot; earned Pink the Grammy award in Best Female Rock Vocal Performance category at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, and &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. She toured extensively on the Try This Tour through Europe and Australia, where the album was better received.

During the same period, Pink co-wrote the song &quot;Take A Picture&quot; with Damon Elliott which was released on Mýa&#x27;s album &quot;Moodring&quot;. In 2005, Pink collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley on the track &quot;Shine&quot;, released on Presley&#x27;s second album &quot;Now What&quot;. Pink took a break to write the songs for her fourth album, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot;, which she said she titled as such because &quot;It&#x27;s about being alive and feisty and not sitting down and shutting up even though people would like you to.&quot; Pink worked with producers Max Martin, Billy Mann, Christopher Rojas, Butch Walker, Lukasz Gottwald, and Josh Abraham on the album. The album&#x27;s release through LaFace Records in April 2006 was a substantial success throughout the world, particularly in Australia. The album reached the top ten in the US, the top five in the UK, No. 1 in Germany, and was No. 1 in Australia for two non-consecutive weeks.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Stupid Girls&quot;, was Pink&#x27;s biggest US hit since 2002 and earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Its music video, in which she parodies celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Paris Hilton, won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video. Subsequent singles &quot;Who Knew&quot; and &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; were substantial hits in Australia and Europe, and they later became top ten singles in the US. in 2007. The non-US singles were &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;, a minor hit in the UK, Australia and Germany; &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, an open letter to the US President George W. Bush which featured the Indigo Girls and became a No. 1 hit in Belgium as well as a top five hit in Germany, Australia, and other countries; &quot;Leave Me Alone (I&#x27;m Lonely)&quot;, a UK top 40 and Australian top five entry; and &quot;&#x27;Cuz I Can&quot;. The album has sold over 1.3 million copies in the US, as well as over 700,000 copies in Australia. The album proved very popular in Australia, with six top five singles and a record-breaking 62 weeks in the top 10; so far the album has gone 10 times platinum.

In support of the album, Pink embarked on the world I&#x27;m Not Dead Tour, for which ticket sales in Australia were particularly high; she sold approximately 307,000 tickets in Australia, giving her the record for the biggest concert attendance for an arena tour by a female artist. One of the London shows on the tour was taped and released as a DVD, &quot;&quot;, where she sang Linda Perry&#x27;s &quot;Whats Up?&quot;. In 2006, Pink was chosen to sing the theme song for &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, &quot;Waiting All Day for Sunday Night&quot;, which is a take on &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot; by Joan Jett. She contributed a cover of Rufus&#x27;s &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, and lent her name to PlayStation to promote the PSP, a special pink edition of which was released.

Pink collaborated with several other artists in 2006 and 2007, when she opened for Justin Timberlake on the American leg of his FutureSex/LoveShow Tour. She sang on the Indigo Girls album &quot;Despite Our Differences&quot;. She was featured on India.Arie&#x27;s song &quot;I Am Not My Hair&quot; from the Lifetime Television film &quot;Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy&quot;. She wrote a song, &quot;I Will&quot;, for Natalia&#x27;s third album, &quot;Everything and More&quot;. &quot;Outside of You&quot;, another song she co-wrote, was recorded by dance-pop singer Hilary Duff and released on her 2007 album &quot;Dignity&quot;. Pink recorded a song with Annie Lennox and twenty-two other female acts for Lennox&#x27;s fourth solo studio album, &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot;; titled &quot;Sing&quot;, it was written as an anthem for HIV/AIDS, according to Lennox&#x27;s website. In December 2007, a special edition &quot;Pink Box&quot;, which comprises her second to fourth albums and the DVD &quot;Live in Europe&quot;, was released in Australia. It reached the top twenty on the albums chart and was certified Gold, selling over 35,000 units.

===2008–2011: &quot;Funhouse&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits... So Far!!!&quot;===
On August 7, 2008, Pink&#x27;s single &quot;So What&quot; was leaked online, and radio stations across Australia were quick to give it massive airplay. Less than six hours after the leak, &quot;So What&quot; was voted No. 1 on Nova 100 Melbourne and shot to No. 1 on the Today Network&#x27;s national radio Hot30 Countdown. On August 22, Pink announced a new track, titled &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;. On September 18, 2008, &quot;So What&quot; became her second number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Pink was the guest of honor at the 2008 ARIA Music Awards, which were held in Sydney, Australia, in October 2008. There she sang &quot;So What&quot;. On November 3, 2008, &quot;Funhouse&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA charts. In Australia it sold over 86,000 units in its first week, and was eventually certified eleven times platinum.

On November 23, 2008, Pink performed &quot;Sober&quot;, the second single from &quot;Funhouse&quot;, at the American Music Awards. The third single was &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot;, with a video directed by Dave Meyers. In Australia, &quot;Bad Influence&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single as a promotional single for her Funhouse Tour, and &quot;Funhouse&quot; was later released as the fifth single.

Sony Computer Entertainment Europe announced a collaboration with Pink in 2006, which included a limited edition &quot;P!nk PSP Value Pack&quot;. PSP Senior Brand Manager for SCEE Stephane Hareau stated: &quot;The P!nk PSP launch is much more than just launching a new colour. It is about a confident and powerful attitude for young women. The association with P!nk, a worldwide icon and musical chameleon, will enable PSP to push new boundaries.&quot; On April 3, 2009, Optus announced a Pre-Paid mobile campaign with the singer. The following year, Pink fronted a multi-million dollar TV campaign for V8 Supercars Australia. She served as their ambassador until 2012. In August 2012, Pink became a spokesmodel for CoverGirl, featuring in a fall 2013 advertising campaign themed &quot;beauty with an edge&quot;.

In 2013, Pink purchased an 18-acre organic vineyard in Santa Barbara County, and around 2018, launched her own brand of wine called &quot;Two Wolves&quot;. Though a high-school dropout, the singer took courses at the University of California, Davis to learn about winemaking.

In January 2023, the singer&#x27;s endorsement was featured in a Pfizer commercial alongside Questlove, Jean Smart, and Michael Phelps, as part of a campaign to remind the public of the availability of COVID-19 products.

==Legacy==

Pink has been credited for breaking boundaries and pushing the envelope throughout her career. She has been called &quot;the most trailblazing artist from the famous teen pop class of circa 1999.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; says, &quot;Pink stood up for her music, broke the music industry&#x27;s mold and scored a breakout hit, challenging a school of teen singers to find their own sounds as well.&quot; He adds, &quot;[Pink] also started a race among other teen pop stars like Christina Aguilera to add substance to their own sound.&quot; Ann Powers refers to her as a &quot;powerhouse vocalist&quot;, stating her mix of rebellion, emotional rawness, humor, and &quot;infectious&quot; dance beats created &quot;a model for the mashup approach of latter-day divas such as Katy Perry, Kesha, and Rihanna.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented: &quot;I think people respond to her sense of independence and dedication. It inspires people... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music.&quot;

James Montgomery of MTV describes her as &quot;a fabulously fearless pop artist&quot; who can &quot;out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy Gaga or Lily. She&#x27;s the total pop-star package, everything you&#x27;d want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said: &quot;She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna.&quot; &quot;Glamour Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Pink changed the game. Without her, the last 13 years of big-voiced, tough chick music is hard to imagine.&quot;

British soul singer Adele considers Pink&#x27;s performance at Brixton Academy in London one of &quot;the most defining moments&quot; in her life, saying, &quot;It was the &quot;Missundaztood&quot; record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible.&quot;

Pink&#x27;s work has inspired many other artists, including Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Tegan and Sara, Ashley Tisdale, Alessia Cara, Victoria Justice, Adele, Julia Michaels, Ben Hopkins of Pwr Bttm, Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha, Halsey, Anne-Marie, Kehlani, and Daya.

==Personal life==

Pink met professional motocross racer Carey Hart at the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was &quot;assisting&quot; in his race and wrote &quot;Will U Marry Me?&quot; on a pit board. He either did not notice or ignored it and continued for another lap. Then Pink added &quot;Serious!&quot; to the board, and he pulled off the track to accept. She then made him finish the race. They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.

After months of speculation, Pink announced in February 2008 that she and Hart had separated. Hart subsequently appeared in the video for her 2008 song &quot;So What&quot;, which deals with their separation. The couple sought marriage counseling during their separation in hopes of reconciliation. In February 2010, Pink confirmed that she and Hart were back together. Hart also appears with Pink in the videos for her songs &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; (from her 2001 album &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot;), &quot;Just Give Me a Reason&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot; (both from her 2012 album &quot;The Truth About Love&quot;), &quot;Just Like Fire&quot; (from the soundtrack to the 2016 film &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;), &quot;90 Days&quot; (from her 2019 album &quot;Hurts 2B Human&quot;) and &quot;All I Know So Far&quot; (from her 2021 live album &quot;All I Know So Far: Setlist&quot;).

In November 2010, Pink announced on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that she and Hart were expecting their first child. In June 2011, she gave birth to their daughter, Willow Sage Hart. In 2018, Willow released a cover of the reprise of &quot;A Million Dreams (Reprise)&quot; for &quot;The Greatest Showman: Reimagined&quot; soundtrack, and in 2021, she released &quot;Cover Me in Sunshine&quot; with her mother. In December 2016, Pink gave birth to their second child, a son. Pink is a supporter of attachment parenting.

In 2010, she appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ &quot;The Celebrity 100&quot; list at number 27, with earnings of $44million. In 2011, she appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ &quot;The Top-Earning Women in Music&quot; list at number 6 with earnings of $22million, with an average of $1million per show on the road. In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; put her at number 6 on their &quot;Money Makers&quot; list, listing her earnings as $36,347,658. In 2013, she appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of &quot;Highest Paid Musicians&quot;, with earnings of $32million. In 2018, she appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of &quot;Highest Paid Female Celebrities&quot;, with earnings of $52million.

On April 4, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Pink announced that she and her three-year-old son showed symptoms for COVID-19 and she subsequently tested positive, but fully recovered. She also announced donations of $500,000 each to the Temple University Hospital Fund in Philadelphia, where her mother worked for nearly two decades, and the City of Los Angeles Mayor&#x27;s Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund. She has had asthma her whole life, and the initial days of fighting the virus exacerbated her condition.

In 2019, Pink revealed to Carson Daly that she struggles with anxiety and depression. The singer had a miscarriage when she was 17.

==Awards and achievements==

Pink has won over 100 awards, including three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards (including Outstanding Contribution to Music), a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award). Billboard named her Woman of the Year in 2013. Pink received the BMI President&#x27;s Award for &quot;her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry.&quot; In 2019, the singer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was also named as Pollstar&#x27;s 2019 Artist of the Year. Following the success of The Beautiful Trauma Tour, Pink accepted the Legend of Live Award at the Billboard Live Music Summit. Three years later, Pink received the Icon Award at the Billboard Music Awards. In 2023, iHeartRadio Music Awards awarded the singer with the Icon Award to recognize her &quot;impact on pop culture, longevity and continued relevance as a touring and radio force with a loyal fan base worldwide.&quot; She was also honored by the Songwriters of North America for her achievement in the industry and her activism efforts.

According to Nielsen SoundScan, Pink&#x27;s record sales stand at 16 million copies in the United States. Pink has sold over 60 million albums and 75 million singles worldwide, making her one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists.

<text>Pink is a pale tint of red, the color of the pink flower. It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century. According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance. A combination of pink and white is associated with innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction. In the 21st century, pink is seen as a symbol of femininity, though it has not always been seen this way. In the 1920s, light red, which is similar to pink, was seen as a color that reflected masculinity.

== In nature and culture ==

== Etymology and definitions ==
The color pink is named after the flowers, pinks, flowering plants in the genus &quot;Dianthus,&quot; and derives from the frilled edge of the flowers. The verb &quot;to pink&quot; dates from the 14th century and means &quot;to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern&quot; (possibly from German &quot;picken&quot;, &quot;to peck&quot;). It has survived to the current day in &quot;pinking shears&quot;, hand-held scissors that cut a zig-zagged line to prevent fraying.

== History, art and fashion ==
The color pink has been described in literature since ancient times. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, written in approximately 800 BCE, Homer wrote &quot;Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared...&quot; Roman poets also described the color. &quot;&quot; is the Latin word meaning &quot;rosy&quot; or &quot;pink.&quot; Lucretius used the word to describe the dawn in his epic poem &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; (&quot;De rerum natura&quot;).

Pink was not a common color in the fashion of the Middle Ages; nobles usually preferred brighter reds, such as crimson. However, it did appear in women&#x27;s fashion and religious art. In the 13th and 14th centuries, in works by Cimabue and Duccio, the Christ child was sometimes portrayed dressed in pink, the color associated with the body of Christ.

In the high Renaissance painting the &quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot; by Raphael, the Christ child is presenting a pink flower to the Virgin Mary. The pink was a symbol of marriage, showing a spiritual marriage between the mother and child.

During the Renaissance, pink was mainly used for the flesh color of white faces and hands. The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese; it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called sinopia, or Venetian red, and a white pigment called &quot;Bianco San Genovese&quot;, or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, &quot;Il Libro Dell&#x27;Arte&quot;, Cennino Cennini described it this way: &quot;This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John&#x27;s white, as it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime. And when these two pigments have been thoroughly mulled together (that is, two parts cinabrese and the third white), make little loaves of them like half walnuts and leave them to dry. When you need some, take however much of it seems appropriate. And this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands, and nudes on walls...&quot;
===18th century===

Pink was particularly championed by Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), the mistress of King Louis XV of France, who wore combinations of pale blue and pink, and had a particular tint of pink made for her by the Sevres porcelain factory, created by adding nuances of blue, black and yellow.

While pink was quite evidently the color of seduction in the portraits made by George Romney of Emma, Lady Hamilton, the future mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson, in the late 18th century, it had the completely opposite meaning in the portrait of Sarah Barrett Moulton painted by Thomas Lawrence in 1794. In this painting, it symbolized childhood, innocence and tenderness. Sarah Moulton was just eleven years of age when the picture was painted, and died the following year.
===19th century===

In 19th century England, pink ribbons or decorations were often worn by young boys; boys were simply considered small men, and while men in England wore red uniforms, boys wore pink. In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes, clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water. Queen Victoria was painted in 1850 with her seventh child and third son, Prince Arthur, who wore white and pink. In late nineteenth-century France, Impressionist painters working in a pastel color palette sometimes depicted women wearing the color pink, such as Edgar Degas&#x27; image of ballet dancers or Mary Cassatt&#x27;s images of women and children. 
=== 20th century - present ===
A dress parade, held in 1949, at the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, caused a stir among attendees due to the vibrant pink tones in the dresses and garments. The journalists and critics of the time, seeking to know Mexican designer Ramón Valdiosera&#x27;s inspiration, asked him about the origin of the color. The artist simply replied that that pink was already part of Mexican culture, which the New York fashion critic Perle Mesta then described as Mexican Pink.

The First inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953), when Eisenhower&#x27;s wife Mamie Eisenhower wore a pink dress as her inaugural gown, is thought to have been a key turning point in the association of pink as a color associated with girls. Mamie&#x27;s strong liking of pink led to the public association with pink being a color that &quot;ladylike women wear.&quot; The 1957 American musical &quot;Funny Face&quot; also played a role in cementing the color&#x27;s association with women.

In the 20th century, pinks became bolder, brighter, and more assertive, partly because of the invention of chemical dyes that did not fade. The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli (1890–1973), who was aligned with the artists of the surrealist movement, including Jean Cocteau. In 1931 she created a new variety of the color, called shocking pink, made by mixing magenta with a small amount of white. She launched a perfume called Shocking, sold in a bottle in the shape of a woman&#x27;s torso, said to be modelled on that of Mae West. Her fashions, co-designed with artists like Cocteau, featured the new pinks.

In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, inmates of Nazi concentration camps who were accused of homosexuality were forced to wear a pink triangle. Because of this, the pink triangle has become a symbol of the modern gay rights movement.

The transition to pink as a sexually differentiating color for girls occurred gradually, through the selective process of the marketplace, in the 1930s and 40s. In the 1920s, some groups had described pink as a masculine color, an equivalent to red, which was considered for men but lighter for boys. But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls, and blue for boys, until this became an accepted norm in the 1940s.

== Science and nature ==
=== Optics ===
In optics, the word &quot;pink&quot; can refer to any of the pale shades of colors between bluish red to red in hue, of medium to high lightness, and of low to moderate saturation. Although pink is generally considered a tint of red, the colors of most tints of pink are slightly bluish, and lie between red and magenta. A few variations of pink, such as salmon color, lean toward orange.

===Sunrises and sunsets===
As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles. This is called Rayleigh scattering. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange, red and pink light. The remaining pinkish sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon a pink or reddish glow.
===Geology===
===Biology===
===Pink coloration of meat and seafood===
Raw beef is red, because the muscles of vertebrate animals, such as cows and pigs, contain a protein called myoglobin, which binds oxygen and iron atoms. When beef is cooked, the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation, and gradually turn from red to pink to brown; that is, from rare to medium to well-done. Pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red; when heated, it changes from pinkish-red to less pink to tan or white.

Ham, though it contains myoglobins like beef, undergoes a different transformation. Traditional hams, such as prosciutto, are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig, covering it with sea salt, which removes the moisture content, and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years. The salt (sodium nitrate) permits the ham to retain its original pink color, even when dried out. Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process; they are brined, or infused with a salt-water solution, containing sodium nitrite, which transfers nitric oxide, which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color.

The shells and flesh of crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp contain a pink carotenoid pigment called astaxanthin. Their shells, naturally blue-green, turn pink or red when cooked. The flesh of the salmon also contains astaxanthin, which makes it pink. Farm-bred salmon are sometimes fed these pigments to improve their pinkness, and it is sometimes also used to enhance the color of egg yolks. 
===Plants and flowers===
Pink is one of the most common colors of flowers; it serves to attract the insects and birds necessary for pollination and perhaps also to deter predators. The color comes from natural pigments called anthocyanins, which also provide the pink in raspberries.
=== Pigments - Pinke ===

In the 17th century, the word &quot;pink&quot; or &quot;pinke&quot; was also used to describe a yellowish pigment, which was mixed with blue colors to yield greenish colors. Thomas Jenner&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing&quot; (1652) categorises &quot;Pink &amp; blew bice&quot; amongst the greens (p.  38), and specifies several admixtures of greenish colors made with pink—e.g. &quot;Grasse-green is made of Pink and Bice, it is shadowed with Indigo and Pink … French-green of Pink and Indico [shadowed with] Indico&quot; (pp. 38–40). In William Salmon&#x27;s &quot;Polygraphice&quot; (1673), &quot;Pink yellow&quot; is mentioned amongst the chief yellow pigments (p. 96), and the reader is instructed to mix it with either Saffron or Ceruse for &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;light&quot; shades thereof, respectively.

=== Sonics ===
* Pink noise (), also known as 1/f noise, in audio engineering is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency.

=== Lighting ===
*Grow lights often use a combination of red and blue wavelengths, which generally appear pink to the human eye.
*Pink neon signs are generally produced using one of two different methods. One method is to use neon gas and a blue or purple phosphor, which generally produces a warmer (more reddish) or more intense shade of pink. Another method is to use an argon/mercury blend and a red phosphor, which generally produces a cooler (more purplish) or softer shade of pink.
*Pink LEDs can be produced using two methods, either with a blue LED using two phosphors (yellow for the first phosphor, and red, orange, or pink for the second), or by placing a pink dye on top of a white LED. Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs, where the red, orange, or pink phosphors or dyes faded over time, causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue. These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more fade-resistant phosphors.

=== Engineering ===
*Insulation manufactured by Owens Corning is dyed pink, with the Pink Panther as its corporate mascot. The company holds a trademark on the color pink for insulation products in order to prevent competitors from using it, and is the first company in the United States to trademark a color.
*The United States Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices specifies fluorescent pink as an optional color for traffic signs used for incident management as an alternative to the traditional orange in order to distinguish them from construction zone signs.

===Common associations and popularity===
According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, softness, childhood, the feminine, and the romantic. Although it did not have any strong negative associations in these surveys, few respondents chose pink as their favorite color. Pink was the favorite color of only two percent of respondents. There was a notable difference between men and women in regards to a preference for pink; three percent of women chose pink as their favorite color, compared with less than one percent of men. Many of the men surveyed were unable to even identify pink correctly, confusing it with mauve. Pink was also more popular with older people than younger.

In Japan, pink is the color most commonly associated with springtime due to the blooming cherry blossoms. This is different from surveys in the United States and Europe where green is the color most associated with springtime.

===Pink in other languages===
In many languages, the word for the color pink is based on the name of the rose flower; like &quot;rose&quot; in French; &quot;roze&quot; in Dutch; &quot;rosa&quot; in German, Latin, Portuguese, Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Swedish and Norwegian (Nynorsk and Bokmål); &quot;rozovyy/розовый&quot; in Russian; &quot;różowy&quot; in Polish; ורוד (&quot;varód&quot;) in Hebrew; গোলাপি (&quot;golapi&quot;) in Bangla; and गुलाबी (&quot;gulābee&quot;) in Hindi. In English &quot;rose&quot;, too, often refers to both the flower and the color.

In Danish, Faroese and Finnish, the color pink is described as a lighter shade of red: &quot;lyserød&quot; in Danish, &quot;ljósareyður&quot; in Faroese and &quot;vaaleanpunainen&quot; in Finnish, all meaning &quot;light red&quot;. Similarly, some Celtic languages use a term meaning &quot;whitish red&quot;: &quot;gwynnrudh&quot; in Cornish, &quot;bándearg&quot; in Irish, &quot;bane-yiarg&quot; in Manx, &quot;bàn-dhearg&quot; in Scottish Gaelic (which also uses &quot;liath-dhearg&quot; &quot;greyish/pale red&quot; and &quot;pinc&quot; from English). In Icelandic, the color is called &quot;bleikur&quot;, originally meaning &quot;pale&quot;.

In the Japanese language, the traditional word for pink, , takes its name from the peach blossom. There is a separate word for the color of the cherry blossom: &quot;sakura-iro&quot;. In recent times a word based on the English version, , has begun to be used.

In Chinese, the color pink is named with a compound noun 粉紅色, meaning &quot;powder red&quot; where the powder refers to substances used for women&#x27;s make-up.

The Thai word for the color, ชมพู (&quot;chom-puu&quot;), derives ultimately from Sanskrit जम्बू (&quot;jambū&quot;) &quot;rose apple&quot;.

===Idioms and expressions===
* In the pink. To be in top form, in good health, in good condition. In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio says; &quot;I am the very pink of courtesy.&quot; Romeo: Pink for flower? Mercutio: Right. Romeo: Then my pump is well flowered.&quot;
* To see pink elephants means to hallucinate from alcoholism. The expression was used by American novelist Jack London in his book &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; in 1913.
* Pink slip. To be given a pink slip means to be fired or dismissed from a job. It was first recorded in 1915 in the United States.
* The phrase &quot;pink-collar worker&quot; refers to persons working in jobs conventionally regarded as &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;.
* Pink money, &quot;the pink pound&quot; or &quot;pink dollar&quot; is an economic term which refers to the spending power of the LGBT community. Advertising agencies sometimes call the gay market the &quot;pink economy&quot;.
* Tickled pink means extremely pleased.
* The Pink Tax refers to the invisible price women must pay for goods that are created and advertised specifically for them. It is the tendency for products targeted specifically toward women to be more expensive than those targeted toward men.

===Architecture===
Early pink buildings were usually built of brick or sandstone, which takes its pale red color from hematite, or iron ore. In the 18th century - the golden age of pink and other pastel colors - pink mansions and churches were built all across Europe. More modern pink buildings usually use the color pink to appear exotic or to attract attention.
=== Food and beverages ===
According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most associated with sweet foods and beverages. Pink is also one of the few colors to be strongly associated with a particular aroma, that of roses. Many strawberry and raspberry-flavored foods are colored pink and light red as well, sometimes to distinguish them from cherry-flavored foods that are more commonly colored dark red (although raspberry-flavored foods, particularly in the United States, are often colored blue as well). The drink Tab was packaged in pink cans, presumably to subconsciously convey a sweet taste.

The pink color in most packaged and processed foods, ice creams, candies and pastries is made with artificial food coloring. The most common pink food coloring is erythrosine, also known as Red No. 3, an organoiodine compound, a derivative of fluorone, which is a cherry-pink synthetic. It is usually listed on package labels as E-127. Another common red or pink (particularly in the United States where erythrosine is less frequently used) is Allura Red AC (E-129), also known as Red No. 40. Some products use a natural red or pink food coloring, Cochineal, also called carmine, made with crushed insects of the family Dactylopius coccus.
=== Gender ===
In Europe and the United States, pink is often associated with girls, while blue is associated with boys. These colors were first used as gender markers just prior to World War I (for either girls or boys), and pink was first established as a female gender indicators in the 1940s. In the 20th century, the practice in Europe varied from country to country, with some assigning colors based on the baby&#x27;s complexion, and others assigning pink sometimes to boys and sometimes to girls.

Many have noted the contrary association of pink with boys in 20th-century America. An article in the trade publication &quot;Earnshaw&#x27;s Infants&#x27; Department&quot; in June 1918 said:

One reason for the increased use of pink for girls and blue for boys was the invention of new chemical dyes, which meant that children&#x27;s clothing could be mass-produced and washed in hot water without fading. Prior to this time, most small children of both sexes wore white, which could be frequently washed. Another factor was the popularity of blue and white sailor suits for young boys, a fashion that started in the late 19th century. Blue was also the usual color of school uniforms, for boys and girls. Blue was associated with seriousness and study, while pink was associated with childhood and softness.

By the 1950s, pink was strongly associated with femininity, but to an extent that was &quot;neither rigid nor universal&quot; as it later became.

One study by two neuroscientists in &quot;Current Biology&quot; examined color preferences across British and Chinese cultures and found significant differences between male and female responses. Both groups favored blues over other hues, but women had more favorable responses to the reddish-purple range of the spectrum and men had more favorable responses to the greenish-yellow middle of the spectrum. Despite the fact that the study used adults in mainstream cultures, and both groups preferred blues, and responses to the color &quot;pink&quot; were never even tested, the popular press represented the research as an indication of an innate preference by girls for pink. The misreading has been often repeated in market research, reinforcing American culture&#x27;s association of pink with girls on the basis of imagined innate characteristics.

As of 2008 various feminist groups and the Breast Cancer Awareness Month use the color pink to convey empowerment of women. Breast cancer charities around the world have used the color to symbolize support for people with breast cancer and promote awareness of the disease. A key tactic of these charities is encouraging women and men to wear pink to show their support for breast cancer awareness and research.

Pink has symbolized a &quot;welcome embrace&quot; in India and masculinity in Japan.

=== Toys ===

Toys aimed at girls often display pink prominently on packaging and the toy themselves. This is a relatively recent trend, with toys from the 1920s to the 1960s not being gendered by color (though they were gendered by a focus on domesticity and nurturing). The current color-based gendering of toys can be traced back to the deregulation of children&#x27;s television programs. This allowed toy companies to produce shows that were designed specifically to sell their products, and gender was an important differentiator of these shows and the toys they were advertising.

In its 1957 catalog, Lionel Trains offered for sale a pink model freight train for girls. The steam locomotive and coal car were pink and the freight cars of the freight train were various pastel colors. The caboose was baby blue. It was a marketing failure because any girl who might want a model train would want a realistically colored train, while boys in the 1950s did not want to be seen playing with a pink train. However, today it is a valuable collector&#x27;s item.

===Sexuality===
As noted above, pink combined with black or violet is commonly associated with eroticism and seduction.
* In street slang, &quot;the pink&quot; sometimes refers to the vagina.
* In Russian, pink (&quot;розовый&quot;, &quot;rozovyj&quot;) is used to refer to lesbians, and light blue (&quot;голубой&quot;, &quot;goluboj&quot;) refers to gay men.

=== Heraldry ===
The word pink is not used for any tincture (color) in heraldry, but there are two fairly uncommon tinctures which are both close to pink:
* The heraldic color of rose is a modern innovation, mostly used in Canadian heraldry, depicting a reddish pink color like the shade usually called rose.
* In French heraldry, the color carnation is sometimes used, corresponding to the skin color of a light skinned Caucasian human. This can also be seen as a pink shade but is usually depicted slightly more brownish beige than the rose tincture.

=== Calendars ===
* In Thailand, pink is associated with Tuesday on the Thai solar calendar. Anyone may wear pink on Tuesdays, and anyone born on a Tuesday may adopt pink as their color.

=== The press ===

Pink is used for the newsprint paper of several important newspapers devoted to business and sports, and the color is also connected with the press aimed at the LGBTQIA community.

Since 1893 the London &quot;Financial Times&quot; newspaper has used a distinctive salmon pink color for its newsprint, originally because pink dyed paper was less expensive than bleached white paper. Today the color is used to distinguish the newspaper from competitors on a press kiosk or news stand. In some countries, the &quot;salmon press&quot; identifies economic newspapers or economics sections in &quot;white&quot; newspapers. Some sports newspapers, such as &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; in Italy, also use pink paper to stand out from other newspapers. It awards a pink jersey to the winner of Italy&#x27;s most important bicycle race, the Giro d&#x27;Italia. (See #Sports).

<doc id="215568" wikidata="Q6569873" url="?curid=215568" title="Derocheilocarididae">
<text>Derocheilocarididae is a family of marine crustaceans that form part of the meiobenthos. It is the only family in the monotypic order Mystacocaridida, and the monotypic subclass Mystacocarida. These mystacocarids are less than long, and live interstitially in the intertidal zones of sandy beaches.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the mystacocarids is extremely conservative, since all mystacocarids look superficially alike. , the 13 described species are divided between two genera, &quot;Derocheilocaris&quot; (eight species) and &quot;Ctenocheilocaris&quot; (five species). The first mystacocarids to be found were discovered on a beach in southern New England in 1939.

==Distribution==
Mystacocarids occur along the coasts of South and North America, southern Africa, and the western Mediterranean. The lack of records from other parts of the world is &quot;almost certainly&quot; due to a lack of appropriate sampling, rather than a true absence.

==Description==
Mystacocarids are tiny pigmentless crustaceans, less than long, that live in the spaces between sand grains on intertidal beaches. They have a cylindrical body, with five thoracic and five abdominal segments.

The appendages of the head—two pairs of long antennae, a pair of limb-like mandibles and two pairs of maxillae—are much longer than those on the thorax and have a number of fine hairs that the animal uses to strain detritus from the water to feed on. Also a labrum is present. The head is relatively large and divided into two by a stricture, so that the larger posterior part gives the appearance of being the thorax. The actual thorax has five pairs of thoracic limbs. The pair on the first segment has been modified into maxillipeds, which collaborates with the maxillae in the feeding process, but is not fused with the head. These three pairs of limbs looks similar, but the maxillipeds can be distinguished from the maxillae in the form of a vestigial exopod. The remaining four thoracic pairs of limbs has been reduced to small, unsegmented lobes, but the last pair is slightly modified in males. Their limbless abdomen ends in a supra-anal plate, a telson and a pair of large, pincer-like furca which on the ventral surface bears two sets of combs with setae. Because of their small size, there is no circulatory or respiratory system. A nauplius eye is completely absent. After mating, mystacocarids lay tiny eggs which hatch into a nauplius or metanauplius larva. Like the adults, the larvae are benthic.

<doc id="215575" wikidata="Q2529157" url="?curid=215575" title="Ja'far al-Askari">
<text>Ja&#x27;far Pasha al-Askari (, ; 15 September 1885 – 29 October 1936) was an Iraqi politician who served twice as Prime Minister of Iraq in 1923–1924 and again in 1926–1927.

Al-Askari served in the Ottoman Army during World War I until he was captured by British forces. After his release, he was converted to the cause of Arab nationalism and joined forces with Faisal I and Lawrence of Arabia with his brother-in-law, Nuri al-Said, who also served as Prime Minister of Iraq. Al-Askari took part in the capture of Damascus in 1918 and supported Faisal&#x27;s bid for the Syrian throne. When Faisal was deposed by the French in 1920, al-Askari supported his bid for the Iraqi throne.

As a reward for his loyalty, Faisal granted al-Askari several important cabinet positions, including Minister of Defense in the first Iraqi government, as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Al-Askari served as prime minister twice. Al-Askari was assassinated during the events of the 1936 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, in which Chief of Staff Bakr Sidqi overthrew the government. At the time, he was serving as Minister of Defense in Yasin al-Hashimi&#x27;s government.

==Early life and Ottoman Army career==
Ja&#x27;far Pasha al-Askari was born on 15 September 1885 in Kirkuk, when it was still part of the Ottoman Empire. The fourth of five brothers and one sister, al-Askari&#x27;s family was of Kurdish origin. His father, Mustafa Abdul Rahman al-Mudarris, was a colonel in the Ottoman Army. Al-Askari attended the Military College in Baghdad before transferring to the Ottoman Military College in the Constantinople, where he graduated in 1904 as a Second Lieutenant. He was then sent to the Sixth Army, stationed in Baghdad. Al-Askari was then sent to Berlin from 1910 to 1912 to train and study as part of an Ottoman initiative to reform the army through the selection of officers via competition. Al-Askari stayed in this program until ordered back to the Ottoman Empire to fight in the Balkan Wars.

After the end of the Balkan Wars in 1913, al-Askari was made an instructor at the Officer Training College in Aleppo, but eight months later passed the qualifications for the Staff Officers&#x27; College in Constantinople.

==World War I and the Arab Rebellion==
When World War I broke out, al-Askari first fought on the side of the Ottomans and the Triple Alliance in Libya. His campaign started in the Dardanelles, after which he received the German Iron Cross and was promoted to General. After his promotion, he was sent to command the Senoussi Army in Libya. At the Battle of Agagia, al-Askari was captured by the British-led forces and imprisoned in a citadel in Cairo with his friend, and later brother-in-law, Nuri al-Said. Al-Askari made one escape attempt by fashioning a rope out of blankets to scale the citadel walls. During this attempt, the blanket tore and al-Askari fell, breaking his ankle and leading to his capture by the guards. According to his obituary, al-Askari offered to pay for the blanket, as he was on friendly terms with his captors.

Sometime after his escape attempt, al-Askari learned about the nationalist Arab Revolt against the Ottomans led by the Hashemite leader of the Hijaz, Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. This revolt had been sponsored by the British and the Triple Entente to weaken the Ottoman Empire. In exchange, the British had promised, during the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, to create an Arab country led by Hussein. Upon learning about the Arab Revolt, and due to an increasingly hostile Ottoman approach to Arab affairs as embodied by the execution of a number of prominent Arabs for nationalist activities by Jamal Pasha, al-Askari decided that this was precisely in line with beliefs he had and decided to join the Hashemite Revolt along with Nuri al-Said. At first, Sharif Hussein was hesitant to let al-Askari, a former general in the Ottoman army, join his forces, but eventually relented, and al-Askari was invited by Hussein&#x27;s son, Prince Faisal, to join in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. Al-Askari fought under Prince Faisal throughout this period up until the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and participated in Faisal&#x27;s assault on Damascus in 1918.

==Governor of Aleppo and Iraqi nationalism==
After World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, another of Hussein&#x27;s sons, Prince Zeid, asked al-Askari on behalf of Prince Faisal to be the Inspector General of the Army of the newly established Kingdom of Syria, which he accepted. Shortly thereafter, al-Askari was appointed the Military Governor of the Aleppo Vilayet in Syria. During his time as governor in Syria, al-Askari heard from Iraqis about the status of their country during British rule. Al-Askari advocated the idea that Iraqis could take charge of their own country and could govern it better than the British. Al-Askari was in favor of a Hashemite ruler for Iraq with ties to Britain; he joined his friend Nuri al-Sa’id in the al-‘Ahd group that was in favor of ties to Britain.

==Establishment of Iraq and political career==
In 1921, the British set up an Arab government in Iraq and chose Prince Faisal, the son of Sharif Hussein, to be King. Faisal had never even been to Iraq, and so chose certain commanders familiar with the area to fill various posts, including al-Askari, who was appointed Minister of Defense. During this period, al-Askari arranged the return of 600 Iraqi Ottoman soldiers to form the Officer Corps of the new Iraqi army.
In November 1923, King Faisal appointed al-Askari as Prime Minister of Iraq. Faisal wanted a strong supporter of the King to be prime minister during this key time when the Constituent Assembly opened in March 1924. The dominant issue during this assembly was the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, put forward by the British to legitimize the Mandate for Mesopotamia. Many Iraqis were opposed to the treaty, and it appeared the treaty would not be signed. However, after threats by High Commissioner Percy Cox, the treaty passed in the Constituent Assembly. Al-Askari subsequently resigned as prime minister due to his personal dissatisfaction.

In November 1926, Faisal again appointed al-Askari (who at the time was acting as a diplomatic minister in London) Prime Minister of Iraq. Two main issues dominated his term in office: conscription and Shi&#x27;a discontent. Conscription was a controversial issue, with some believing it was needed to encourage a strong Iraq by creating a strong army.Sharifians—former Ottoman soldiers who had fought in the Arab revolt—saw conscription as a holy duty, and those in power also saw it as a way to create national unity and an Iraqi identity. On the other side, Iraqi Shi&#x27;a found it repugnant, and the various tribes who wished to be autonomous found it threatening. The British were not in favor of conscription, as they thought it could lead to issues in Iraq that would require their intervention, and they also wanted to keep the country weak to enable them to have tighter control of the country. Further complicating al-Askari&#x27;s term was the growing Shi&#x27;a discontent in Iraq with massive protests occurring across the country in response to a book written by a Sunni official criticizing the Shi&#x27;a majority, as well as the promotion of the commanding officer of an army unit that opened fire on Shi&#x27;a demonstrators during a rally. Also at this time, the British wanted a new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty signed. Among the numerous powers the British retained in the new Treaty, the British would support Iraq&#x27;s entry into the League of Nations in 1932—not in 1928 as previously promised—as long as it kept itself progressing in a manner consistent with British supervision. Al-Askari resigned as prime minister in December 1927 as a result of the lukewarm reception the Draft Treaty received among the Iraqi people and the growing discontent among the Shi&#x27;a majority.

In addition to his two terms as prime minister, al-Askari also served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Diplomatic Minister in London, and as Minister of Defense on four separate occasions. He was elected as the president of the Chamber of Deputies in November 1930 and in November 1931.

==Assassination and aftermath==
During the 1936 military coup led by Bakr Sidqi against the government of Yasin al-Hashimi, al-Askari, who was serving as Minister of Defense, was sent to negotiate with Bakr Sidqi in an attempt to stop the violence, and to inform him of the new change in government, since Hashimi resigned and was replaced with Sidqi&#x27;s ally Hikmat Sulayman. Sidqi was suspicious and ordered his men to intercept and kill al-Askari. His body was hastily buried along the roadside as Sidqi&#x27;s supporters triumphantly took over Baghdad. It is mentioned in some sources that Sidqi claimed to be a distant cousin of al-Askari.

Al-Askari&#x27;s assassination proved to be detrimental to Sidqi. Many of Sidqi&#x27;s supporters in the army no longer supported the coup, as al-Askari was popular among the rank-and-file—many of whom had been recruited and trained under him. His death helped to undermine the legitimacy of Sidqi&#x27;s government. The British, the Iraqis, and many of Sidqi&#x27;s supporters were horrified by the act. The new government only lasted 10 months before Sidqi was assassinated in a plot by the Officers&#x27; Corps of the Iraqi army. After his assassination, his government was dissolved and Sulayman stepped down as prime minister. Al-Asakari&#x27;s brother-in-law was not content with Sidqi&#x27;s death, and sought revenge against those he found responsible for al-Askari&#x27;s death. He claimed Sulayman and others were plotting to assassinate King Ghazi. The evidence was speculative and, in all likelihood, false, and yet they were found guilty and sentenced to death, later commuted to life in prison.

<text>P.O.D. (an initialism for Payable on Death) is an American Christian metal band formed in 1992 and based in San Diego, California. The band&#x27;s line-up consists of vocalist Paul Joshua &quot;Sonny&quot; Sandoval, bassist Mark &quot;Traa&quot; Daniels, lead guitarist Marcos Curiel, and drummer Noah &quot;Wuv&quot; Bernardo. They have sold over 12 million records worldwide.

Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. With their third studio album, &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, they achieved their initial mainstream success; the album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2000. Their following studio album, &quot;Satellite&quot;, continued the band&#x27;s success with the singles, &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;, pushing it to go triple platinum.

== History ==
=== Early years (1991–1993) ===
In 1991, friends Wuv Bernardo and Marcos Curiel engaged in jam sessions, with Bernardo playing the drums and Curiel covering guitar with no vocalist. Calling themselves &quot;Eschatos&quot;, they started playing at keg parties doing Metallica and Slayer cover songs.

After his mother&#x27;s fatal illness, Sonny Sandoval converted to Christianity and was asked by Bernardo, his cousin, to join the band as a way to keep his mind straight as mentioned on their DVD, &quot;Still Payin&#x27; Dues&quot;. They then recruited bassist Gabe Portillo and eventually changed their name to P.O.D.

=== &quot;Snuff the Punk&quot; and &quot;Brown&quot; (1994–1998) ===

After recording a demo tape, Traa Daniels joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Portillo. P.O.D. signed with Rescue Records, a label created by Bernardo&#x27;s father, Noah Bernardo Sr., who was also the band&#x27;s first manager. Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, &quot;Snuff the Punk&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot; and &quot;Payable on Death Live&quot;. Longtime manager Tim Cook was first introduced to the band when he booked them to play his club The Where-House in Bartlesville, Oklahoma following strong local word of mouth support. He later described their performance by saying: &quot;I stood at the back of the venue with tears in my eyes – it was the greatest thing I had ever seen.&quot; By that point, Bernardo Sr. was looking for someone else to take P.O.D.&#x27;s career further and so Cook took over as manager.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Payable on Death Live&quot;, Essential Records offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but on behalf of the band Sandoval told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, &quot;God has a bigger plan for P.O.D.&quot; When, in 1998, Atlantic Records A&amp;R John Rubeli first came across P.O.D.&#x27;s demo he &quot;didn&#x27;t quite get it&quot;, as he later told HitQuarters. It was only when he saw them play live at The Roxy on the Sunset Strip. The band was quickly signed to a major-label deal. P.O.D. soon released &quot;The Warriors EP&quot;, a tribute EP to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.

=== &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; and &quot;Satellite&quot; (1999–2002) ===

P.O.D.&#x27;s third studio album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, spawned the hits &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot;, which was their first video to reach No. 1 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The song &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Little Nicky&quot; while both &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party&quot; appeared in the movie. All three music videos enjoyed heavy play on MTV2 and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become RIAA certified platinum.

On September 11, 2001 P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, &quot;Satellite&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Alive&quot;, went on to become one of MTV&#x27;s and MTV2&#x27;s top played videos of the year. The video&#x27;s popularity, as well as the song&#x27;s positive message, helped the song become a huge modern rock radio hit and it was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2002. Also in 2002, the band contributed the song &quot;America&quot; to Santana&#x27;s album &quot;Shaman&quot;.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;, was influenced in part by the school shootings at Santana High School, Columbine High School, and Granite Hills High School. It was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2003. The 2002 singles, &quot;Boom&quot; and &quot;Satellite&quot;, also became quite popular. In addition, the concluding track of the album, &quot;Portrait,&quot; was Grammy nominated for Best Metal Performance in 2003. “Boom” was used in, and part of its lyrics the title of, the comedy film &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot;, starring Kevin James.

&quot;Satellite&quot; went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum. The author of &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music&quot; has described P.O.D. as &quot;One of the biggest success stories in recent Christian music.&quot;

=== &quot;Payable on Death&quot; and &quot;Testify&quot; (2003–2006) ===
On February 19, 2003, guitarist Curiel left the band due to his side project, &quot;The Accident Experiment&quot;, and &quot;spiritual differences.&quot; However, Curiel claimed that he was actually kicked out of the band. Curiel was replaced by Jason Truby, former member of Christian metal band Living Sacrifice, and assisted with the recording of &quot;Sleeping Awake&quot;, from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; soundtrack. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Sandoval stated that Truby is the reason why the group is still together. On November 4, 2003, P.O.D. released their fifth studio album, &quot;Payable on Death&quot;, which saw the group shift from their well-known rapcore sound to a darker, more melodic metal sound. The album was hit with controversy due to its &quot;occult&quot; cover, which led as many as 85% of Christian bookstores across the United States to ban the album. With the help of the album&#x27;s hit single &quot;Will You&quot; and &quot;Change the World&quot;, it went on to sell over 520,000 copies and was certified Gold. 

P.O.D.&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Testify&quot; was slated for a December 2005 release, but was pushed back to January 24, 2006. On November 15, 2005, P.O.D. released &quot;The Warriors EP, Volume 2&quot;, which featured demos from the upcoming album, to help build up the fans&#x27; anticipation for the pending January release. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Goodbye for Now&quot; (with a vocal tag by a then-unknown Katy Perry) went on to become a No. 1 video on MTV&#x27;s TRL, along with having a solid radio presence, it also became the band&#x27;s unprecedented 4th number one video on Total Request Live. The second single off the album, &quot;Lights Out&quot; was a minor hit, but was featured as the official theme song to WWE&#x27;s Survivor Series 2005. In another contribution to WWE, they performed fellow San Diego native Rey Mysterio&#x27;s theme song &quot;Booyaka 619&quot; at &quot;WrestleMania 22&quot;. To promote their latest album, P.O.D. went on a nationwide tour called the &quot;Warriors Tour 2: Guilty by Association&quot;, which began in April, and included the bands Pillar, The Chariot and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster.

On August 11, 2006, P.O.D. announced in their online newsletter that they had left Atlantic Records.
On September 16, 2006, P.O.D. announced that they had teamed up with Rhino Records to release a greatest hits record simply titled, &quot;Greatest Hits: The Atlantic Years&quot;, which was released on November 21, 2006. They shot a music video for their single &quot;Going In Blind&quot;, one of the two new songs they included in the tenth album, and they had meetings with various record labels to begin working on new material for an album they hoped to release in mid-2007.

=== &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot; (2007–2009) ===

In a statement made by the band&#x27;s manager on their MySpace page, it was officially announced, on December 30, 2006, that Jason Truby had left the band. They had said &quot;God worked it out because Truby decided to leave the band the same day Curiel asked to rejoin.&quot; Curiel performed with the band for the first time since his departure on the 2006 New Year&#x27;s Eve episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!.

On February 2, 2007, the band made a new record deal with INO Records.

On June 1, 2007, at the Rockbox in San Diego, the band performed and revealed a new song entitled &quot;Condescending&quot;, along with another new song performed on June 16, 2007, at the Journeys Backyard BBQ tour entitled &quot;Addicted&quot;. They also revealed the title of their new album to be &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot;. On August 4, 2007, the band played at Angel Stadium of Anaheim&#x27;s annual Harvest Crusade for a crowd of 42,000, where they revealed a new song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Ready&quot;, originally thought to be titled &quot;When Babylon Come for I&quot;.

The album cover was officially revealed on December 10, 2007. The title track was released for free download on their site in January 2008. The first single &quot;Addicted&quot; was released on February 19 and peaked at No. 30 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album was released on April 8, 2008, entitled &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot;. On July 28, 2008, the group played a free public performance at the Orange County Choppers headquarters in Newburgh, NY, with OCC The Band opening. The band also played on August 16, 2008, at the Angel Stadium of Anaheim&#x27;s annual Harvest Crusade. During September 2008 P.O.D played alongside Redline, Behind Crimson Eyes, Alter Bridge, and Disturbed as part of the Music As a Weapon tour 2008 in Australia.

=== &quot;Murdered Love&quot; (2010–2013) ===

The band headlined the first annual Spring Jam Fest in May 2011. They appeared on the Rock of Allegiance tour later that summer. On July 25, 2011, the band released a demo of the song &quot;On Fire&quot; as a free download on their official website.

In October 2011, P.O.D. announced a multi-album artist deal with Razor &amp; Tie. On April 5, 2012, the song &quot;Eyez&quot; became a free download on the band&#x27;s website for a limited time. Shortly after, an article on their website stated that &quot;Lost in Forever&quot; would be the first single from the new album, entitled &quot;Murdered Love&quot;.

&quot;Murdered Love&quot; was originally going to be released in June 2012, but was instead pushed back to July 10. The album was produced by Howard Benson, who also produced &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;. It was described by Curiel as &quot;Back to our roots. A little bit of hip hop, a little bit of punk rock, or reggae&quot;. The album caused controversy concerning its eleventh track, &quot;I Am&quot;, which uses the word &quot;fuck&quot; (albeit backmasked). Sandoval, explaining the purpose of the song, said:
The band went on tour with Shinedown and Three Days Grace as an opening act.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Broken Records Magazine&quot;, Sandoval said that the band had to get their lives back in order and take care of personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely happy about the response the band was getting from fans.

On October 22, 2013, P.O.D. released a deluxe edition of &quot;Murdered Love&quot;. The album contains the original songs, slightly remixed, along with bonus tracks &quot;Find a Way&quot;, &quot;Burn It Down&quot;, acoustic versions of &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;West Coast Rock Steady&quot;, a remixed version of &quot;On Fire&quot;, and music videos for &quot;Murdered Love&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Higher&quot;, and &quot;Lost In Forever&quot;. Multiple behind the scenes videos were also on the track list.

=== &quot;SoCal Sessions&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, Wuv Bernardo&#x27;s hiatus and &quot;Veritas&quot; (2014–present) ===
In mid-2014, P.O.D. announced an acoustic album to be released toward the end of the year. The album was crowd-funded on the website PledgeMusic. On October 20, 2014, P.O.D. announced a new record deal with T-Boy Records along with a new acoustic album. &quot;SoCal Sessions&quot; was released on November 17, 2014, and contained songs such as &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;.

The band followed that release with another studio album, &quot;The Awakening&quot;, released on August 21, 2015, which was produced by Howard Benson, with guest vocalists such as Maria Brink of In This Moment and Lou Koller of Sick of It All.

On May 17, 2016, the band announced that they would be taking part in the Make America Rock Again super tour throughout the summer and fall 2016. The tour featured a number of artists who had success throughout the 2000s.

On August 18, 2017, the band released a new song, &quot;Soundboy Killa&quot;, and embarked on a fall tour promoting the song.

In January 2018, it was announced that the band had signed a new record deal with Mascot Records. They toured alongside Alien Ant Farm, Lit, and Buckcherry on the &quot;Gen-X Tour&quot; in 2018. Their tenth studio album, &quot;Circles&quot;, was released on November 16, 2018.

In 2021, the band embarked on a major tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Satellite&quot; with From Ashes to New and All Good Things, starting in Sturgis, South Dakota at Buffalo Chip on August 14, 2021, and ending on October 7, 2021, at the House of Blues in San Diego, California. During the European leg of the tour, drummer Wuv Bernardo dropped out to &quot;take care of business at home&quot;, and ceased touring and appearing in public with the band. To fill his absence, the band recruited former Suicide Silence drummer Alex Lopez as touring member for subsequent tours. 

In August 2022 the band performed two sets on the same day at Seaworld. On October 14, 2022, the band reissued &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot;, having the album remixed and remastered as well as featuring three bonus songs, one of which, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fake It&quot;, had appeared previously as an iTunes exclusive in 2008. 

P.O.D. released &quot;Veritas&quot;, their first studio album in six years and the first album without Bernardo, on May 3, 2024. In an interview with &quot;United Rock Nations&quot;, Sandoval stated that Bernardo is “not out of the band”, but rather is taking personal space due to tension in the band and “will always be the drummer of P.O.D.”; Bernardo confirmed in an interview that he has taken a hiatus, stating that &quot;Nothing is on bad terms, it&#x27;s more we&#x27;re having space right now. Being on tour for thirty years starts to take a toll on anybody in different ways...For me it was obvious that it was that time for me to take a break from the traveling and doing the whole circus over and over again. I don&#x27;t think I was built to do it any longer at the time...Love the guys, always gonna love the band. I started the band in my garage. It&#x27;s a part of my life, it&#x27;s a part of my family, it&#x27;s a part of all the love that I got. I&#x27;m always gonna be center, right there with the guys, knowing what&#x27;s going on and everything like that. Whenever God wants me to come back, then that&#x27;s what&#x27;s up for me. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at right now.&quot;

In February 2024, the band announced the I Got That Tour supporting &quot;Veritas&quot;″s release, which ran from April 26 to June 2 and was headlined by Bad Wolves, Norma Jean and Blind Channel.

== Musical style and influences ==
The band&#x27;s name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the banking term &quot;Payable on Death&quot;. The band chose this name to be a direct tie in with the Christian theology that explains that since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians&#x27; debts to God have been paid; in other words all believers, in their acceptance that Jesus was sacrificed for them on God&#x27;s behalf, have inherited eternal life. P.O.D.&#x27;s style has evolved over the years, from the rap metal sound on their early albums to the nu metal and reggae-infused alternative metal styles for which they&#x27;re most well known. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot;, is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.&#x27;s influences include Boogie Down Productions, Run-DMC, U2, the Police, Bad Brains, Santana, Metallica, AC/DC, Suicidal Tendencies, Bob Marley, Primus, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, 24-7 Spyz, and Steel Pulse.

<text>Guayaquil (), officially Santiago de Guayaquil, is the largest city in Ecuador and also the nation&#x27;s economic capital and main port. The city is the capital of Guayas Province and the seat of Guayaquil Canton. The city is located on the west bank of the Guayas River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Guayaquil.

== Nomenclature ==
The origin of the name &quot;Santiago de Guayaquil&quot; has been much discussed, although that &#x27;Guayaquil&#x27; is pre-Hispanic. Since the founding of the city by the Spanish in 1534, it has been linked to the name of &quot;Santiago&quot; in memory of its patron saint, Santiago, apostle of Christ. He is also designated as patron saint of several other Spanish American colonial cities, such as Santiago de Chile, as he is of Spain.

A theory based on a romantic legend, transmitted orally, attributes the name Guayaquil to the joining of the name of a leader named Guayas and of his wife Quil. They are symbols of the local resistance that—according to local tradition—chose to fight to the death (and as a final act, set fire to the town), rather than surrender to the Spanish conquerors.

A town with a name similar to Guayaquil is located near the city of Durán (Autopista Durán-Boliche km. 23). Investigations by archeologists and historians has led them to conclude that when the town was conquered by the Spanish, it was ruled by a man named Guayaquile. 

They have not determined if the man or the town was first to receive that name. But researcher Ángel Véliz Mendoza, in his book on the man Guayaquile, says that there at least seven references to the toponym in pre-1543 documents. It is believed that the name Guayaquil is taken from the population&#x27;s final home, in lands of the chief Guayaquile. This region was occupied by the &quot;chonos&quot;, people whose archeological name (in Spanish) is Cultura Milagro-Quevedo.

After several location changes and fires, the city was founded in 1547, and named the &quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil&quot; (&quot;Very noble and very loyal city of Santiago de Guayaquil&quot;). After the city&#x27;s independence in 1820, the words &quot;very noble and very loyal&quot; disappeared from use, as the city was no longer part of the Spanish Empire. Today, the official name of &quot;Santiago de Guayaquil&quot; is seldom used outside of official contexts.

==History==
Guayaquil was founded on 25 July 1538 by Spanish conqueror Francisco de Orellana in the location of a native village. He named it as (&quot;Most Noble and Most Loyal City of Santiago de Guayaquil&quot;).

On 20 April 1687, Guayaquil was attacked and looted by English and French pirates under the command of George d&#x27;Hout (English), and Picard and Groniet (French). Of more than 260 pirates, 35 were killed and 46 were wounded; 75 defenders of the city died and more than 100 were wounded.

In 1709, English captains including Woodes Rogers 
and William Dampier, along with a crew of 110, looted Guayaquil and demanded ransom. But they departed suddenly and without collecting the ransom after an epidemic of yellow fever broke out.

In colonial times Guayaquil was the chief Spanish shipyard in the Pacific, although some navigators considered that Valdivia (now in Chile) had better conditions.

Guayaquil was a stopover point in the commerce between Asia and Latin America conducted via Philippines-based Manila galleons. The trade route had links to Acapulco in present-day Mexico and terminated with a node in Callao, Peru.

In the late eighteenth century, the majority of slaves in the region were located in Guayaquil. Their lives and work were conditioned by a practice called . The owners held them legally but the slaves had &quot;considerable independence&quot; in exchange for paying their owners a fee (the ) every day. Such enslaved Native Americans, such as María Chiquinquirá, would work inside urban homes. (She was a local hero because she successfully went to court in 1794 to argue for her freedom.) Other jornalado enslaved men worked alongside free workers in the shipyards. 

By the turn of the nineteenth century, slaves had fought for their freedom in increasing numbers. Together they formed a social group known as the .

On 9 October 1820, almost without bloodshed, a group of civilians, supported by soldiers from the &quot;Granaderos de Reserva&quot; battalion quartered in Guayaquil, led by the Peruvian Colonel Gregorio Escobedo, overwhelmed the resistance of the Royalist guards and arrested the Spanish authorities. Guayaquil declared independence from Spain, becoming the &quot;Provincia Libre de Guayaquil&quot;. José Joaquín de Olmedo was named of Guayaquil.

Departing from Guayaquil, General Antonio José de Sucre, sent by Simón Bolivar and supported by a division promised by José de San Martín, led the allied independence army in the Battle of Pichincha. His victory confirmed the independence of the Gran Colombia and also what would become the future Republic of Ecuador.

On 26 July 1822, generals José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar held a meeting in Guayaquil to plan how to complete achieving the independence of Perú and, with it, all of Spanish South America. In 1829, the city was invaded by the Peruvian Army, which occupied it for seven months.

In 1860, the city was the site of the Battle of Guayaquil, the last of a series of military conflicts between the forces of the Provisional Government, led by Gabriel García Moreno and General Juan José Flores, and the forces of the Supreme Chief of Guayas, General Guillermo Franco, whose government was recognized as possessing sovereignty over the Ecuadorian territory by Peruvian president Ramón Castilla. Moreno&#x27;s forces were victorious, countering Peruvian influence over Ecuador.

In 1896, large portions of the city were destroyed by a fire.

On 8 July 1898, the Guayaquil City Hall officially recognized the anthem written by José Joaquín de Olmedo in 1821, with the music composed by Ana Villamil Ycaza in 1895, as the or , most widely known now as the (&quot;Guayaquil Anthem&quot;).

In 1922, workers in the city went on a general strike lasting three days, ending after at least 300 people were killed by military and police.

In 2020, the city was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its medical and mortuary services were overwhelmed to the point where bodies lay in the streets. Almost 6,000 more deaths were recorded in the first two weeks of April than the average for the same period in other years.

==Economy==

&quot;Guayaquileños&quot;&#x27; main sources of income are formal and informal trade, business, agriculture and aquaculture. Most commerce consists of small and medium businesses, adding an important informal economy occupation that gives thousands of guayaquileños employment.

The Port of Guayaquil is Ecuador&#x27;s most important commercial port; most international import and export merchandise passes through the Gulf of Guayaquil. As the largest city in the country, most industries are located either in the city or its peripheral areas.

=== Tourism ===
Guayaquil plays an important role in Ecuador&#x27;s economy as the commercial heart of the country, and is also a vibrant, sprawling city, urban, cultural and touristic.

, Guayaquil&#x27;s mayor was Cynthia Viteri. Viteri is the second elected female mayor in the city&#x27;s history; the first was Elsa Bucaram in 1988. The previous mayor, Jaime Nebot, endorsed her. A campaign of construction projects for the city began in the early 2000s to attract tourism. The &quot;urban regeneration&quot; plan reconstructed the city&#x27;s main tourist streets&#x27; sidewalks and upgraded the city&#x27;s chaotic transit system with multiple infrastructure projects (speedways, bridges, overhead passages, tunnels, etc.).

In August 2006, the city&#x27;s first rapid transit bus system, Metrovía, opened to provide a quicker, high-capacity service. One of the main projects was called &quot;Malecón 2000&quot; , the renovation of the waterfront promenade (&quot;malecón&quot;) along the Guayas River. Another project was the creation of the&quot; Nuevo Parque Histórico&quot;, a park in a housing development area that is called &quot;Entre Ríos&quot; because it lies between the Daule and Babahoyo rivers (which merge to form the Guayas River) in a mangrove wetland area. The park cost the city about US$7 million.

In 2013, the national government led by Rafael Correa built two pedestrian bridges connecting downtown Guayaquil, Santay Island, and the town of Durán, to allow people to make ecotourism trips and return the same day.

==Geography==
Guayaquil is the nation&#x27;s largest city and the capital of Guayas Province. It is on the Guayas River about north of the Gulf of Guayaquil, near the Equator.

Guayaquil faces major earthquake threats due to its soil stratigraphy and location on the ring of fire and the south of the North-Andean subduction zone.

The city can be easily damaged by earthquakes as its weak and compressible soil is composed of deep soft sediments over hard rocks and deposits in a brackish environment. Also, the city itself is strongly affected by the subduction of the active Ecuadorian margin, an intraplate region where active faults locate; and the Guayaquil-Babahoyo strike-slip fault system, formed as the North Andean Block drifts northward.

The tsunami threat is caused by the nearby Gulf of Guayaquil which also is one of the major locations on the Earth where earthquakes tend to happen all the time. It has complex tectonic features such as the Posorja and the Jambeli – two major east–west trending detachment systems; the Puna-Santa Clara northeast-southwest trending fault system; and the Domito north-south trending fault system; that have developed since the Pleistocene times. Tsunami threats are only predicted for coastal farming zones, not the main populated areas.

Guayaquil, along with most of the coastal region, was impacted by the 16 April 2016 earthquake of 7.8 magnitude. A bridge that was above a major artery, Avenida de las Americas, collapsed in the early evening on that day, killing two people.

===Climate===
Guayaquil features a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;). Between January and April, the climate is hot and humid with heavy rainfall, especially during El Niño years when it increases dramatically and flooding usually occurs. The rest of the year (from May through December), however, rainfall is minimal due to the cooling influence of the Humboldt Current, with usually cloudy mornings and afternoons, and evening breezes.

==Food==
Typical Guayaquil cuisine includes mostly seafood dishes such as encebollado, ceviche, cazuela, and encocado (shrimp or tuna with a coconut sauce and rice).

During breakfast, patacones and bolon (fried plantain with cheese mashed and given a rounded shape) play a big role. These plantain dishes are often accompanied with bistec de carne or encebollado de pescado.

Another prominent breakfast dish are empanadas &quot;de viento&quot; made with wheat flour and stretchy cheese or empanadas &quot;de verde&quot; plantain based with mozzarella cheese.

Pan de yuca similar to pão de queijo usually served with &quot;yogur persa&quot; is a typical snack in Guayaquil. With the rise in middle eastern migration, shawarma shops dot the city.

Chifa or Chinese-Ecuadorian dishes like arroz chaufa, tallarin saltado, and sopa Fui Chi Fu are common fast food options.

Some other original dishes of Guayaquil are the plantain ball soup (based on peanuts and green plantains creating a green plantain ball filled with meat and other ingredients). Bollo, analogous to hallaca, is another typical dish of this city that also the main ingredient is the green plantain and seafood. Just to mention others are the biche, sango de mariscos, and arroz con pescado frito (rice with fried fish)

Arroz con menestra y carne asada (rice with stew and roast meat), churrasco, Guatita, Caldo de mondongo, Humitas, Maduro lampriado, Maduro con queso, Tripita, are some more dishes included in the great and diverse gastronomy of the city.

Guayaquil is located along national Highway 40 and is near Highway 25.

Among Guayaquil&#x27;s major trading points are the seaport, the largest in Ecuador and one of the biggest handlers of shipping on the shores of the Pacific; and José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport.

José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport, though using the same runways, had its passenger terminal completely rebuilt in 2006 and was renamed. The old passenger terminal is now a convention centre.

Guayaquil is served by a bus rapid transit system, Metrovia, which opened in 2006. The system has three lines and is supplemented by 35 feeder routes, carrying a total of 400,000 daily passengers.

The Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos offers tourist rail service to Quito from the neighboring city of Durán, Ecuador, located across the Guayas River from Guayaquil.

=== Port of Guayaquil ===
The Port of Guayaquil is the most important one in Ecuador and one of the major ports in Latin America. The port provides capacities for handling cargo, but is also a hub for transshipment for other countries in the pacific region.

Since the decrease of the Colombian FARC drug gang business and the raise of Ecuadorian cartels, the harbor of Guayaquil is one of the most important spots of drug trafficking to Colombia, Mexico and the US.

Responsible for port operation is the state Guayaquil Port Authority.

<text>iiO (pronounced &quot;eye-oh&quot;) was a New York City-based dance music act composed of singer and songwriter Nadia Ali and record producer Markus Moser. The group gained prominence for its 2001 single, &quot;Rapture&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in the United Kingdom. Following the success of &quot;Rapture&quot;, iiO released several singles and the studio album &quot;Poetica&quot; in 2005. The album reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart.

The same year, Ali left iiO to pursue a solo career. Meanwhile, Moser continued to release material, featuring her on vocals, which included the 2006 single &quot;Is It Love?&quot; that reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2011, he released the studio album &quot;Exit 110&quot;, which again, featured Ali on vocals and was announced as the final project of the act.

==History==
Nadia Ali was working in the New York offices of Versace, when a co-worker introduced her to record producer Markus Moser, who was looking for a female singer to collaborate on some of his productions for a girl group. The two teamed up and started a group that was originally named &quot;Vaiio&quot;, named after the Sony Vaio laptop Ali used to write lyrics on. They later dropped the &quot;va&quot;, on the advice of their label, to avoid causing problems in the future with Sony. Working with Moser, she wrote the lyrics and the vocals for the songs. Their first release was the 2001 single, &quot;Rapture&quot;, a song Ali wrote in 30 minutes based on a relationship with an Australian man she met in a nightclub. &quot;Rapture&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. Outside of the United States, &quot;Rapture&quot; was a hit across Europe, most notably in the United Kingdom, where the song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in November 2001. The song was remixed by prominent DJs and record producers including Avicii, Paul van Dyk, John Creamer &amp; Stephane K, Armin van Buuren and Deep Dish.

&quot;Rapture&quot; was followed by &quot;At the End&quot; in 2002. The duo subsequently released &quot;Smooth&quot; in 2003, &quot;Runaway&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Kiss You&quot; in 2005. Their first studio album, &quot;Poetica&quot;, was released in 2005 by Made Records. The release of the album was timed with the dissolution of iiO with Ali leaving to pursue a solo career. Meanwhile, Moser continued to release material, featuring her on the vocals. These included the 2006 number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play single, &quot;Is It Love?&quot;, the 2007 remix album, &quot;Reconstruction Time: The Best of iiO Remixed&quot;, and the 2008 compilation album, &quot;Rapture Reconstruction: Platinum Edition&quot;.

In 2010, iiO re-emerged from hiatus when Moser released new remixes of &quot;At the End&quot;. In April 2011, iiO&#x27;s second studio album and final project, &quot;Exit 110&quot;, was released, featuring Ali on vocals. Speaking of the album, Ali explained that she had no involvement in it except her vocals and lyrics from nearly ten years ago being used for the project. She described it as &quot;interesting&quot; that there was new work featuring her being released by iiO when she had neither worked with or been in contact with Moser since she left iiO and was completely focused on her solo career. When asked further if the dissolution of the duo was amicable, she refused to comment further. Moser, on the other hand, said he decided to use material Ali had recorded before she left iiO to release a new album due to a demand by fans.

<text>Guayas () is a coastal province in Ecuador. It is bordered to the west by Manabí, Santa Elena, and the Pacific Ocean (as the Gulf of Guayaquil); to the east by Los Ríos, Bolívar, Chimborazo, Cañar, and Azuay; to the north by Los Ríos and Bolívar; and to the south by El Oro and the Pacific Ocean.

With a population of over 4 million people, it is the most populous province in Ecuador. In terms of area it is the seventh largest province in the country. The main port of Ecuador, Guayaquil, is located within the province.

==Geography==
Guayas&#x27; natural terrain is very diverse. The province has no elevations, except for the Coastal Range, which starts in Guayaquil and goes to Manabí. The areas west of the Coastal Range are desertic, with an average temperature of 23 °C. The areas east of the range belong to the Guayas Watershed. They are quite humid and fertile, especially in the north of the province, with an average temperature of 30 °C in the humid season (December–May) and 25 °C in the dry season (June–November).

===Hydrography===
The most important river in the province is the Daule River, which flows from the north to join the Babahoyo River to form the Guayas river. The province is part of the largest river basin in South America west of the Andes Mountains.

===Roads===
Guayas has its own system for numbering roads. However, this system is unknown to most residents, so it is not regularly used.

The inter-provincial roads are also numbered with the national system. Even routes travel north–south; odd routes travel east–west. The inter-provincial roads that cross the province are the following:
*Ecuador Highway 15 (Vía del Pacífico; Pacific Way)
*Ecuador Highway 25 (Troncal de la Costa; Coastal Main Way)
*Ecuador Highway 40 (Transversal Austral; Austral Crossing Way)

== History ==

===Pre-Hispanic cultures===
The native culture living in Guayas is the Huancavilca culture. Exactly before the European discovery of America, the Huancavilca Culture was living in the province. Their descendants make up a large part of the population of the province.

===Spanish conquest and independence===
Guayaquil was founded on August 14, 1534 (its is celebrated on July 25). During the Spanish conquest, Guayaquil became one of the most important ports in South America. The city became free on October 9, 1820, and the Guayaquil Department (one of the original subdivisions of Ecuador) was founded soon afterwards. It consisted of the Manabí Province, and the Guayaquil Province, which was later renamed Guayas. The Guayaquil Province included territory of what now is Peruvian Tumbes, and today&#x27;s Los Ríos and El Oro. The provinces were separated from Guayas in 1860 and 1884, respectively.

===Urbanization===
Guayas is the most populous province in the country. In recent decades, there has been a massive exit from rural areas to the main cities (especially Guayaquil). This has created a problem in Guayaquil, as most of the migrants move to municipal areas, creating shantytowns, with no services like water or electricity.

== Demographics ==
Guayas is the most populous province in the country. The estimated population of the province in 2003 was about 3,360,000 people. A large percentage of the population are &quot;mestizos&quot;, i.e. descendants of both Spanish and indigenous peoples, there are also big communities of people that descend from Italians, Lebanese and German people.

Ethnic groups as of the Ecuadorian census of 2010:
*Mestizo 67.5%
*Montubio 11.3%
*White 9.8%
*Afro-Ecuadorian 9.7%
*Indigenous 1.3%
*Other 0.5%

== Political divisions==
The province is divided into 25 cantons. The following table lists each with its population at the time of the 2010 census, its area in square kilometres (km2), and the name of the canton seat or capital.

<text>William Burnet (December 13, 1730 – October 7, 1791) was an American political leader and physician from New Jersey. He served in the Continental Army and the Continental Congress.

==Biography==
He was born on December 13, 1730, in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Burnet graduated from Princeton University in 1749, studied medicine under Dr. Staats in White Plains, New York, and started his practice in Newark, New Jersey. He was a member of Newark&#x27;s Committee of Safety in 1775 before he joined the Continental Army as a surgeon. He opened a hospital in Newark for wounded soldiers, and ran it throughout the Revolution. He was appointed Surgeon General for the Eastern Region in 1776, and also held that position until the war ended in 1783.

Burnet was elected to the Continental Congress in 1780 and served from December 11, 1780, until his resignation on April 1, 1781, when he was forced to leave this service by the press of other duties and his wife&#x27;s illness. Later that year he began serving as a judge in Essex County. He also led the New Jersey Medical Society in 1787. He was a member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of New Jersey, taking the seat of his brother Ichabod upon his death. He died in Newark, New Jersey, on October 7, 1791, aged 60, and was interred in that city&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church Cemetery.

==Family==
He married Mary Camp (1731–1781) and raised a large and successful family. Among his sons by his first wife Jacob Burnet was later a United States Senator from Ohio, while Ichabod and William, Jr. followed their father as doctors. With his second wife, Gertrude Gouverneur Rutgers, the widow of Anthony A. Rutgers (a brother of Henry Rutgers who founded Rutgers University), Burnet had three more sons. Isaac G. Burnet served as mayor of Cincinnati, and his youngest son, David Gouverneur Burnet, played a prominent role in Texas&#x27;s struggle for independence.

<doc id="215609" wikidata="Q483672" url="?curid=215609" title="Ali Abdullah Saleh">
<text>Ali Abdullah Saleh Affash (21 March 19474 December 2017) was a Yemeni military officer and politician who served as the first president of the Republic of Yemen from the Yemeni unification in 1990 until his resignation in 2012, following the Yemeni revolution. Previously, he had served as the fourth and last President of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen), from July 1978 to 22 May 1990, after the assassination of President Ahmad al-Ghashmi. al-Ghashmi had earlier appointed Saleh as military governor in Taiz.

Saleh developed deeper ties with Western powers, especially the United States, during the War on Terror. Islamic terrorism may have been used and encouraged by Ali Abdullah Saleh in order to win Western support and for disruptive politically motivated attacks. In 2011, in the wake of the Arab Spring, which spread across North Africa and the Middle East (including Yemen), Saleh&#x27;s time in office became increasingly precarious, until he was eventually ousted as President in 2012. He was succeeded by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who had been serving as vice president since 1994, and acting president since 2011.

In May 2015, Saleh openly allied with the Houthis (Ansar Allah) during the Yemeni civil war,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.aljazeera.com2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in which a protest movement and subsequent insurgency succeeded in capturing Yemen&#x27;s capital, Sanaa, causing President Hadi to resign and flee the country. In December 2017, he declared his withdrawal from his coalition with the Houthis and instead sided with his former enemies – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and President al-Hadi.

On 4 December 2017, during a battle between Houthi and Saleh supporters in Sanaa, the Houthis accused Saleh of treason, and he was killed by a Houthi sniper. Reports were that Saleh was killed while trying to flee his compound in a car; however, this was denied by his party officials, who said he was executed at his house.

==Early life==

Ali Abdullah Saleh Affash was born on 21 March 1947 to a poor family in Beit al-Ahmar village (Red House village) from the Sanhan () clan (Sanhan District), whose territories lie some 20 kilometers southeast of Sanaa, then capital of the northern Kingdom of Yemen. Saleh&#x27;s father, Abdallah Saleh died after he divorced Ali Abdullah&#x27;s mother when Saleh was still young. His mother later remarried her deceased former husband&#x27;s brother, Muhammad Saleh, who soon became Saleh&#x27;s mentor and stepfather. Saleh&#x27;s brother Mohammed was a major general and had three children: Yahya, Tareq, and Ammar, who all served under Saleh during his rule.
Saleh&#x27;s cousin, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar from the Al Ahmar family, which is also part of the Sanhan clan is often confused with the same-named leading family of the Hashid tribe, with which the Sanhan clan was an ally. The Hashid tribe, in turn, belongs to the larger Yemeni parent group, the Kahlan tribe. The clans Sanhan and Khawlan are said to be related.

Ali Abdallah Saleh married Asama Saleh in 1964.

== Military career and rise to the presidency ==
Saleh received his primary education at Ma&#x27;alama village before leaving to join the Royal (North Yemeni) Armed Forces in 1958 as an infantry soldier and was admitted to the Royal Military Academy in 1960. Three years later, in 1963, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in armoured corps. He participated in the Nasserist-inspired military coup of 1962, which was instrumental in the removal of King Muhammad al-Badr and the establishment of the Yemen Arab Republic, beside that he wasn&#x27;t an Nasserist. During the North Yemen Civil War, he attained the rank of major by 1969. He received further training as a staff officer in the Higher Command and staff C Course in Iraq, between 1970 and 1971, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He became a full colonel in 1976 and was given command of a mechanised brigade. In 1977, the President of North Yemen, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, appointed him as military governor of Taiz.

After al-Ghashmi was assassinated on 24 June 1978, Colonel Saleh was appointed to be a member of the four-man provisional presidency council and deputy to the general staff commander. On 17 July 1978, Saleh was elected by the Parliament to be the President of the Yemen Arab Republic, while simultaneously holding the positions of chief of staff and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

&quot;Governance in the Middle East and North Africa: A Handbook&quot; describes Saleh as being neither from a &quot;sheikhly family&quot; nor a &quot;large or important tribe&quot; either, but instead rising to power through &quot;his own means&quot;, and creating a patronage system with his family at the top. His seven brothers were placed &quot;in key positions&quot;, and later he relied on &quot;sons, daughters, sons-in-law and nephews&quot;. Beneath the positions occupied by his extended family, Saleh &quot;relied heavily on the loyalty&quot; of two tribes, his own Sanhan tribe and the Hamdan San&#x27;a tribe of his mentor, the late president al-Ghashmi. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Middle Eastern correspondent Robert F. Worth described Saleh as reaching an understanding with powerful feudal &quot;big sheikhs&quot; to become &quot;part of a Mafia-style spoils system that substituted for governance&quot;. Robert Worth accused Saleh of exceeding the aggrandisement of other Middle Eastern strongmen by managing to &quot;rake off tens of billions of dollars in public funds for himself and his family&quot; despite the extreme poverty of his country.

== North Yemen presidency ==
On 10 August 1978, Saleh ordered the execution of 30 officers who were charged with being part of a conspiracy against his rule. Saleh was promoted to major general in 1980, elected as the secretary-general of the General People&#x27;s Congress party on 30 August 1982, and re-elected president of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1983.

The People&#x27;s Constituent Assembly, which had been created somewhat earlier, selected Col. Ali Abdullah Saleh as al-Ghashmī’s successor. Despite early public skepticism and a serious coup attempt in late 1978, Saleh managed to conciliate most factions, improve relations with Yemen&#x27;s neighbours, and resume various programs of economic and political development and institutionalization. More firmly in power in the 1980s, he created the political organization that was to become known as his party, the General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC), and steered Yemen into the age of oil.

In the late 1980s, Saleh was under considerable international pressure to permit his country&#x27;s Jewish citizens to travel freely to places abroad. Passports were eventually issued to them, which facilitated their unrestricted travel.

== Unified Yemen presidency ==

The decline of the Soviet Union severely weakened the status of South Yemen, a communist-originated state, and, in 1990, the North and South agreed to unify after years of negotiations. The South accepted Saleh as President of the unified country, while Ali Salim al-Beidh served as the Vice President and a member of the Presidential Council.

After Iraq lost the Gulf War, Yemeni workers were deported from Kuwait by the restored government.

In the 1993 parliamentary election, the first held after unification, Saleh&#x27;s General People&#x27;s Congress won 122 of 301 seats. South disagreeing with their party&#x27;s third place position, started a brief civil-war until 1994 when Saleh&#x27;s army ended the insurgency.

=== Terrorist links ===

Around 1994, jihadists from Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s Egyptian Islamic Jihad attempted to regroup in Yemen following a harsh crackdown in Egypt. In this, they were tacitly supported by the regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh, as he found them useful in his fight against southern separatists in the civil war of 1994. After using Islamic militants to repress the separatist Yemeni Socialist Party and keep the country under his rule, Saleh turned a blind eye to their activities and allowed their sympathizers to work in his intelligence services.

=== Military promotion ===
On 24 December 1997, Parliament approved Saleh&#x27;s promotion to the rank of field marshal, making him the highest-ranking military officer in Yemen.

He became Yemen&#x27;s first directly elected president in the 1999 presidential election, winning 96.2% of the vote. The only other candidate, Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha&#x27;abi, who was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi, the former president of South Yemen. Though a member of Saleh&#x27;s General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.

=== 1999 election ===

After the 1999 elections, the Parliament passed a law extending presidential terms from five to seven years, extending parliamentary terms from four to six years, and creating a 111-member, presidentially-appointed council of advisors with legislative power. This move prompted Freedom House to downgrade their rating of political freedom in Yemen from 5 to 6.

=== 2006 election ===

In July 2005, during the 27th-anniversary celebrations of his presidency, Saleh announced that he would &quot;not contest the [presidential] elections&quot; in September 2006. He expressed hope that &quot;all political parties – including the opposition and the General People&#x27;s Congress – find young leaders to compete in the elections because we have to train ourselves in the practice of peaceful succession.&quot; However, in June 2006, Saleh changed his mind and accepted his party&#x27;s nomination as the presidential candidate of the GPC, saying that when he initially decided not to contest the elections his aim was &quot;to establish ground for a peaceful transfer of power&quot;, and that he was now, however, bowing to the &quot;popular pressure and appeals of the Yemeni people.&quot; Political analyst Ali Saif Hasan said that he had been &quot;sure [President Saleh] would run as a presidential candidate. His announcement in July 2005 – that he would not run – was exceptional and unusual.&quot; Mohammed al-Rubai, head of the opposition supreme council, said the president&#x27;s decision &quot;show[ed] that the president wasn&#x27;t serious in his earlier decision. I wish he hadn&#x27;t initially announced that he would step down. There was no need for such farce.&quot;In the 2006 presidential election, held on 20 September, Saleh won with 77.2% of the vote. His main rival, Faisal bin Shamlan, received 21.8%. Saleh was sworn in for another term on 27 September 2006.

In December 2005, Saleh stated in a nationally televised broadcast that only his personal intervention had prevented a U.S. occupation of the southern port of Aden after the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, stating &quot;By chance, I happened to be down there. If I hadn&#x27;t been, Aden would have been occupied as there were eight U.S. warships at the entrance to the port.&quot; However, transcripts from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services stated that no other warships were in the vicinity at the time.

=== Colluding with terrorists ===

After 9/11, Saleh sided with America in the War on Terror. Following the mysterious &quot;escape&quot; of Al Qaeda convicts in Yemeni custody during the 2006 Yemen prison escape, Saleh demanded more American money and support in order to catch the fugitives.

In an investigative documentary allegations were made that Saleh&#x27;s government supported and directly helped Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

An informant for the National Security Bureau (NSB) and Political Security Organization (PSO) made these allegations.&quot;Hani Muhammad Mujahid, 38, told Al Jazeera that &quot;many Al-Qaeda leaders were under the complete control of Ali Abdullah Saleh&quot;, &quot;Ali Abdullah Saleh turned Al-Qaeda into an organized criminal gang. He was not only playing with the West. He was playing with the entire world&quot;.&quot;Richard Barrett, who was with Britain&#x27;s MI6 intelligence agency before becoming director of the Al-Qaeda Monitoring Team for the UN, described Mujahid&#x27;s story of his background in Afghanistan, his return to Yemen and his involvement with AQAP as &quot;credible&quot;. The attack on the U.S. Embassy in 2008 was funded by Saleh&#x27;s nephew and Al Qaeda leaders had close relationships with him. The informant also gave critical intelligence on terrorist movements, attacks and leaders but no action was taken.

== Ousted from the presidency ==

===Protests===

In early 2011, following the Tunisian revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, opposition parties attempted to do the same in Yemen. Opposition elements started leading protests and demanding that Saleh end his three-decade-long rule because of the perceived lack of democratic reform, widespread corruption and human rights abuses carried out by him and his allies. His net worth was estimated to be between 32 and 64 billion dollars with his money spread across multiple accounts in Europe and abroad.

On 2 February 2011, facing a major national uprising, Saleh announced that he would not seek re-election in 2013, but would serve out the remainder of his term. In response to government violence against protesters, eleven MPs of Saleh&#x27;s party resigned on 23 February. By 5 March, this number had increased to 13, as well as the addition of two deputy ministers.

On 10 March 2011, Saleh announced a referendum on a new constitution, separating the executive and legislative powers. On 18 March, at least 52 people were killed and over 200 injured by government forces when unarmed demonstrators were fired upon in the university square in Sana&#x27;a. The president claimed that his security forces were not at the location, and blamed local residents for the massacre.

On 7 April 2011, the United States diplomatic cables leak reported the plans of Hamid al-Ahmar, the Islah Party leader, prominent businessman, and de facto leader of Yemen&#x27;s largest tribal confederation claiming that he would organize popular demonstrations throughout Yemen aimed at removing President Saleh from power.

On 23 April 2011, facing massive nationwide protests, Saleh agreed to step down under a 30-day transition plan in which he would receive immunity from criminal prosecution. He stated that he planned to hand power over to his vice president, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi as part of the deal.

On 18 May 2011, he agreed to sign a deal with opposition groups, stipulating that he would resign within a month; On 23 May, Saleh refused to sign the agreement, leading to renewed protests and the withdrawal of the Gulf Cooperation Council from mediation efforts in Yemen.

===Assassination attempt and resignation===
On 3 June 2011, Saleh was injured in a bomb attack on his presidential compound. Multiple C-4 (explosive) charges were planted inside the mosque and one exploded when the president and major members of his government were praying. The explosion killed four bodyguards and former prime minister, Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani (who died later of his wounds), deputy prime ministers, head of the Parliament, governor of Sanaa and many more. Saleh suffered burns and shrapnel injuries, but survived, a result that was confirmed by an audio message he sent to state media in which he condemned the attack, but his voice clearly revealed that he was having difficulty in speaking. Government officials tried to downplay the attack by saying he was lightly wounded. The next day he was taken to a military hospital in Saudi Arabia for treatment. According to U.S. government officials, Saleh suffered a collapsed lung and burns on about 40 per cent of his body. A Saudi official said that Saleh had undergone two operations: one to remove the shrapnel and a neurosurgery on his neck.

On 4 June 2011, Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was appointed as acting president, while Saleh remained the President of Yemen.

On 7 July 2011, Saleh appeared for his first live television appearance since his injury. He appeared badly burned and his arms were both bandaged. In his speech, he welcomed power-sharing but stressed it should be &quot;within the framework of the constitution and in the framework of the law&quot;. On 19 September 2011, he was pictured without bandages, meeting King Abdullah.

On 23 September 2011, Yemeni state television announced that Saleh had returned to the country after three months amid increasing turmoil in a week that saw increased gun battles on the streets of Sana&#x27;a and more than 100 deaths.

Saleh said on 8 October 2011, in comments broadcast on Yemeni state television, that he would step down &quot;in the coming days&quot;. The opposition expressed skepticism, however, and a government minister said Saleh meant that he would leave power under the framework of a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative to transition toward democracy.

On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to Riyadh in neighbouring Saudi Arabia to sign the Gulf Cooperation Council plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The agreement also led to the formation of a government divided by Saleh&#x27;s political party (GPC) and the JMP.

It was reported that Saleh had left Yemen on 22 January 2012 for medical treatment in New York City. He arrived in the United States six days later. After his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi won the 2012 Yemeni presidential election on 21 February 2012 running unopposed, Saleh formally ceded power to him and stepped down as the President of Yemen on 27 February 2012, pledging to support efforts to &quot;rebuild&quot; the country still reeling from months of violence.

==Post-presidency==
In February 2013, Saleh opened a museum documenting his 33 years in power, located in a wing of the Al Saleh Mosque in Sanaa. One of the museum&#x27;s central display cases exhibits a pair of burnt trousers that Saleh was wearing at the time of his assassination attempt in June 2011. Other displays include fragments of shrapnel that were taken out of his body during his hospital treatment in Saudi Arabia, as well as various gifts given to Saleh by kings, presidents and world leaders over the course of his rule.

Later that year, in October, the United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar said that Saleh and his son have the right to run in the next Yemeni presidential election, as the 2011 deal does not cover political incapacitation.

Saleh was a behind-the-scenes leader of the Houthi takeover in Yemen led by Zaydi Houthi forces. Tribesmen and government forces loyal to Saleh joined the Houthis in their march to power. The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Saleh in 2014, accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing Yemen&#x27;s political process, subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze. On 28 July 2016, Saleh and the Houthi rebels announced a &quot;formal alliance&quot; to fight the Saudi-led military coalition, run by a Supreme Political Council of 10 members – made up of five members from Saleh&#x27;s General People&#x27;s Congress, and five from the Houthis. The members were sworn in on 14 August 2016.

==Death==

Houthi spokesperson Mohamed Abdel Salam stated that his group had spotted messages between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saleh three months before his death. He told the Qatari channel Al-Jazeera that there was communications between Saleh, the UAE and a number of other countries such as Russia and Jordan through encrypted messages. The alliance between Saleh and the Houthi broke down in late 2017, with armed clashes occurring between former allies in Sana&#x27;a from 28 November. Saleh declared his split from the Houthi movement in a televised statement delivered on 2 December, calling on his supporters to take back the country and expressed his openness to a dialogue with the Saudi Arabian-led coalition.

On 4 December 2017, Saleh&#x27;s house in Sana&#x27;a was assaulted by fighters of the Houthi movement, according to residents. Saleh was killed on his way to Marib while trying to flee into Saudi-controlled territories after a rocket-propelled grenade struck and disabled his vehicle in an ambush and he was subsequently shot in the head by a Houthi sniper, something his party denied. The Houthis published a video allegedly depicting Saleh&#x27;s body with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was confirmed by a senior aide to Saleh, and also by Saleh&#x27;s nephew. His death has been described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as an embarrassment in a string of Saudi foreign policy failures under Mohammad bin Salman.

Saleh&#x27;s home was captured by Houthis before he fled. Officials of his party General People&#x27;s Congress, while confirming his death, stated that a convoy he and other party officials were travelling in was attacked by Houthis as they fled towards his hometown Sanhan. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi meanwhile celebrated Saleh&#x27;s death and called it &quot;the day of the fall of the treasonous conspiracy&quot;. He also stated that his group had &quot;no problem&quot; with the GPC or its members. Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi offered condolences for Saleh&#x27;s death and called for an uprising against the Houthis. The Houthis accused the UAE of dragging Saleh to &quot;this humiliating fate.&quot;

On 9 December 2017, he was buried in Sana&#x27;a, according to an official. A Houthi commander reported that the burial was held in strict conditions with no more than 20 people attending.

==In popular culture==
The Chinese 2018 movie &quot;Operation Red Sea&quot; is about the conflict in Yewaire, a country loosely based on Yemen, with a coup launched by General Sharaf, who was based on Saleh but never made an appearance.

==Wealth==
The UN Sanctions Panel said that by 2012 Saleh had amassed a fortune worth $32–60 billion hidden in at least twenty countries, making him one of the richest people in the world. Saleh was gaining $2 billion a year from 1978 to 2012, mainly through illegal methods, such as embezzlement, extortion and theft of funds from Yemen&#x27;s fuel subsidy programs.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Asma Saleh in 1964, at the age of seventeen. The couple have seven sons, including the eldest Ahmed Saleh (born 1972), former commander of the Republican Guard, once considered a potential successor to his father, and Khaled.

His half-brother, General Mohamed Saleh al-Ahmar was commander of the Yemeni Air Force.

<doc id="215611" wikidata="Q458169" url="?curid=215611" title="Charlotte Mew">
<text>Charlotte Mary Mew (15 November 1869 – 24 March 1928) was an English poet whose work spanned the eras of Victorian poetry and Modernism.

==Early life and education==

Mew was born in Bloomsbury, London, daughter of the architect Frederick Mew (1833-1898), who designed Hampstead Town Hall, and Anna Maria Marden (1837-1923), daughter of architect H. E. Kendall, for whom Frederick Mew had previously worked as an assistant. Frederick was the son of an innkeeper on the Isle of Wight. The marriage produced seven children. Charlotte, nicknamed Lotti by her family, attended Gower Street School, where she was greatly influenced by the school&#x27;s headmistress, Lucy Harrison, and attended lectures at University College London. The family moved to 9, Gordon Street in 1888, living in &quot;genteel near-poverty&quot;; her father died in 1898 without making adequate provision for his family. Two of her siblings suffered from mental illness and were committed to institutions, and three others died in early childhood, leaving Charlotte, her mother, and her sister Anne. 

Charlotte and Anne made a pact never to marry for fear of passing mental illness on to their children. Mew was likely a lesbian; according to Penelope Fitzgerald&#x27;s account in Mew&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, after Mew&#x27;s first short story was published in the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; journal, &quot;she met and was deeply attracted to its dashing assistant editor, Ella D&#x27;Arcy. In 1902 she went to meet Ella in Paris, but the visit was a bitter disappointment. Ten years later she fell in love with the novelist May Sinclair, and apparently chased her into the bedroom, where she was humiliatingly rejected. Her divided nature made these emotional disasters particularly painful because her ladylike side ... totally disapproved of them.&quot; One scholar believes that Charlotte was &quot;almost certainly chastely lesbian&quot;. However, a more recent biography by the poet Julia Copus questions some of these assumptions about Charlotte Mew. Copus mentions that Mew has &quot;frequently been identified as a lesbian&quot; including by Penelope Fitzgerald. Yet, she adds, there is also a rumour that Mew &quot;conducted an illicit affair with Thomas Hardy&quot;. Copus argues that &quot;such hypotheses occur when there is a vacuum surrounding a writer’s private life; we do not like to accept that no evidence can be found – or indeed that there may have been no active love life at all.&quot; The matter, Copus continues, is further compounded by the fact that Mew was exceptionally private and omitted even to provide biographical notes for anthologies.

Mew had a strong sense of style: her friend and editor Alida Monro remembers her wearing distinctive red worsted stockings in the winter months, and she insisted on buying her black, button-up boots (in a tiny size 2) from Pinet&#x27;s bootmakers in Mayfair; items left to different friends in her will (such as a &quot;small three drop diamond pendant&quot; and a &quot;scarlet Chinese embroidered scarf&quot;) also suggest a keen interest in fashion. In later years, she often dressed in masculine attire, adopting the appearance of a dandy. Another biography by Julia Copus questions this notion of Charlotte Mew as a dandy, suggesting her attire was not quintessentially &quot;masculine&quot; as has been claimed in the past.

==Writing career==
In 1894, Mew succeeded in getting a short story published in &quot;The Yellow Book.&quot; Entitled &quot;Passed,&quot; it was inspired by Mew&#x27;s activities as a volunteer social worker and concerns a distressed woman, suggested to be a prostitute, who leads the narrator to a room where her sister lies dead. The narrator is profoundly shocked by the experience, but flees in the end to her comfortable life. She later sees the woman, accompanied by a man, and this causes the narrator to break down, unable to ignore the social ills around her. Five years followed without any publications, but by the beginning of the 20th century Mew was contributing fiction with some regularity to magazines, including &quot;Temple Bar.&quot; She apparently wrote very little poetry until the 1910s. Her first collection, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Bride&quot;, was published in 1916 in chapbook format by the Poetry Bookshop; in the United States this collection was entitled &quot;Saturday Market&quot; and published in 1921 by Macmillan. It earned her the admiration of Sydney Cockerell and drew respect for her as a poet from writers such as Sara Teasdale, Ezra Pound, and Virginia Woolf.

Her poems are varied: some of them (such as &quot;Madeleine in Church&quot;) are passionate discussions of faith and the possibility of belief in God; others are proto-modernist in form and atmosphere (&quot;In Nunhead Cemetery&quot;). She made experimental use of long, prose-like lines, and varieties of enjambment and indentation, which has been praised for its originality. Many of her poems are in the form of dramatic monologues, and she often wrote from the point of view of a male persona (&quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Bride&quot;). Two concern mental illness – &quot;Ken&quot; and &quot;On the Asylum Road&quot;. Many of Mew&#x27;s poems, including &quot;Ken&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Bride&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Market&quot;, are about outcast figures, expressing Mew&#x27;s feelings of alienation from the community in which she lived. Her poem &quot;The Trees Are Down&quot; is a poignant plea for ecological sensitivity and is singled out particularly in the anthology &quot;The Green Book of Poetry&quot; by Ivo Mosley.

Mew gained the patronage of several literary figures, notably Thomas Hardy, who called her the best woman poet of her day; Virginia Woolf, who said she was &quot;very good and interesting and quite unlike anyone else&quot;; and Siegfried Sassoon. In 1923, she obtained a Civil List pension of £75 per year with the aid of Cockerell, Hardy, John Masefield, and Walter de la Mare. This helped ease her financial difficulties.

==Decline and death==
Despite the critical success of her work, Mew did not earn enough money to support herself as well as her mother and sister. In 1916, the house they lived in was condemned. 

After the death of her sister from cancer in 1927, Mew continued to live at 64, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square. She descended into a deep depression and was admitted to the Beaumont Street Nursing Home in Marylebone, where she committed suicide by drinking Lysol, a disinfectant. After Mew&#x27;s death, her friend Alida Monro (who was married to Harold Monro, publisher of Mew&#x27;s first book), collected and edited her poetry for publication as &quot;The Rambling Sailor&quot;, released in 1929.

Mew is buried in the northern part of Hampstead Cemetery in London.

<doc id="215615" wikidata="Q1142488" url="?curid=215615" title="Colophon (city)">
<text>Colophon (; ) was an ancient city in Ionia. Founded around the end of the 2nd millennium BC, it was likely one of the oldest of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. It was located between Lebedos (120 stadia to the west) and Ephesus (70 stadia to its south). Its ruins are south of the town Değirmendere in the Menderes district of Izmir Province, Turkey.

The city&#x27;s name comes from the word κολοφών, &quot;summit&quot;, (which is also the origin of the bibliographic term &quot;colophon&quot;, in the metaphorical sense of a &#x27;crowning touch&#x27;,) as it was sited along a ridgeline. The term &quot;colophony&quot; for rosin comes from the term &quot;colophonia resina&quot; ( &quot;Kolophōnia rhētinē&quot;), resin from the pine trees of Colophon, which was highly valued for increasing friction of the bow hairs of stringed musical instruments.

== History ==

According to Apollodorus and Proclus, the mythical seer Calchas died at Colophon after the end of the Trojan War. Strabo names Clarus as the place of his death, which would later be a cult center in the territory of Colophon. An oracle had it that he would die when he would meet a better seer than himself. As Calchas and the other heroes on their way home from Troy came upon the seer Mopsus in Colophon, the two competed in their mantic qualities. Calchas couldn&#x27;t equal Mopsus&#x27; skills as a seer, being a son of Apollo and Manto, so he died.

In Greek antiquity Damasichthon and Promethus, two sons of Codrus, King of Athens, established a colony there. (Promethus later killed Damasichthon; he then escaped to Naxos, and died there, but his corpse was brought back to Colophon by Damasichthon&#x27;s sons, and subsequently lay near Colophon). It was the birthplace of the philosopher Xenophanes and the poets Antimachus and Mimnermus.

Colophon was the strongest of the Ionian cities and renowned both for its cavalry and for the inhabitants&#x27; luxurious lifestyle, until Gyges of Lydia conquered it in the 7th century BC. Colophon then went into decline and was eclipsed by neighbouring Ephesus and by the rising naval power of Ionia, Miletus.

After the death of Alexander the Great, Perdiccas expelled the Athenian settlers on Samos to Colophon, including the family of Epicurus, who joined them there after completing his military service.

In the 3rd century BC, it was destroyed by Lysimachus—a Macedonian officer, one of the successors (Diadochi) of Alexander the Great, later a king (306 BC) in Thrace and Asia Minor, during the same era when he nearly destroyed (and did depopulate by forced expulsion) the neighboring Ionian League city of Lebedos.

Notium served as the port, and in the neighbourhood was the village of Clarus, with its famous temple and oracle of Apollo Clarius, where Calchas vied with Mopsus in divinatory science.

In Roman times, after Lysimachus&#x27; conquest, Colophon failed to recover (unlike Lebedos) and lost its importance; actually, the name was transferred to the site of the port village of Notium, and the latter name disappeared between the Peloponnesian War and the time of Cicero (late 5th century BC to 1st century BC).

Additionally, the city, as a major location on the Ionic mainland, was cited as a possible home or birthplace for Homer. In his &quot;True History&quot;, Lucian lists it as a possible birthplace along with the island of Khios and the city of Smyrna, though Lucian&#x27;s Homer claims to be from Babylon.

== Bishopric ==

While tradition gave as the first bishops of the bishopric of Colophon Sosthenes ( and ) and Tychicus (), the only ones historically documented are Eulalius or Euthalius, who was at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, and Alexander who was represented at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, without attending it personally.

Colophon continued to be listed in &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; as late as the 12th or 13th century, as a suffragan of Ephesus, capital of the Roman province of Asia.

No longer a residential bishopric, Colophon is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

The network was originally owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment; a division of Warner Communications, and the original owner of sister channel MTV at the time. It was launched in the channel space of the Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s short-lived Cable Music Channel. 

VH1 was originally conceived to build upon the success of MTV by playing music videos targeting a slightly older demographic focusing on the lighter, softer side of popular music. Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music and into reality television programming; albeit with a focus on music personalities, celebrities, and shows targeting African-American audiences. A few of VH1&#x27;s shows were moved to MTV. VH1 is best known for franchises such as &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, the &quot;I Love...&quot; series, the &quot;Celebreality&quot; block, &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot;, and &quot;Basketball Wives&quot;. As of December 2023, VH1 is available in approximately 67,481,000 American households; down from 90.2 million in January 2016.

== History ==
VH1, an acronym for Video Hits One, launched on January 1, 1985, over the channel space of Turner&#x27;s Cable Music Channel. The channel originally focused on music and programming aimed at older audiences than its sibling channel at the time, MTV. 

On August 27, 1985, parent company Warner Communications sold 31% of VH1 and its siblings (MTV and Nickelodeon; which were already divested by Warner into MTV Networks) to Viacom. Viacom would eventually buy the remaining 69% of MTV Networks from Warner for $326 million on May 20, 1986. By 1989, VH1&#x27;s music programming would cater to Top 40, adult contemporary, classic rock, and 1980s mainstream pop. During the 1990s, VH1 would gain popularity for original music-related programs such as &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot;, &quot;VH1 Video Timeline &quot;and &quot;Behind the Music.&quot;

In the 2000s, VH1 would begin to scale down its music offerings, while shifting its focus to pop-culture and nostalgia-based programming; including reality television shows focused on celebrities, and various documentaries and panel shows. Headlining this programming shift would be VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebreality&quot; block, featuring &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; &amp; its franchise of various spinoffs. One spin off, &quot;Flavor of Love&quot;, proved to be a ratings success, and is cited by observers as the beginning of the network&#x27;s programming leaning towards shows about African-American personalities (such as the &quot;Basketball Wives&quot; and &quot;Black Ink Crew&quot; franchises); similar to BET and its sister networks. In 2011, VH1 debuted the first installment of the &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; franchise; which would go on to become the network&#x27;s longest-running program.

On November 9, 2022, it was announced that oversight of VH1 would move to the BET Media Group under Scott Mills, before being moving back to MTV Entertainment Group three years later in 2025.

== Programming ==

Original programming currently seen on VH1 includes the &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop&quot; and the &quot;Basketball Wives&quot; franchises. Other notable shows and franchisees that have aired on the network include &quot;Black Ink Crew&quot;, &quot;The Impact: New York&quot; (a spinoff of BET+&#x27;s &quot;The Impact: Atlanta&quot;), &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; (which was moved over from Logo, and aired on VH1 from 2017–2022), reruns and new episodes of &quot;Nick Cannon Presents: Wild &#x27;N Out&quot; (which originated on MTV), and &quot;Martha &amp; Snoop&#x27;s Potluck Dinner Party&quot;. 

Since the 2010s, VH1&#x27;s programming had shifted towards Black-focused personalities and programming, and before music was completely de-emphasized from its brand, hip-hop and adult R&amp;B.

== Sister and international networks ==
=== VH1 HD ===
VH1 HD (launched in 2005) is a 1080i high-definition feed, with all major providers carrying the network; as of 2016 this feed is downgraded at a provider&#x27;s headend to provide the network&#x27;s standard definition channel on systems.

=== Sister channels in the U.S. ===

VH1 initially launched four spinoff digital networks as part of &quot;The MTV Suite&quot;, with another being launched at a later date. By August 2016, these channels spinoffs had either been realigned under the MTV, BET, or CMT branding, or were shuttered altogether.
* VH1 Classic: Music videos primarily from the 1970s and 1980s, but also the 1960s and 1990s, concert footage, vintage movies, and original programming focused on adult hits, classic hits and classic rock music. Rebranded as MTV Classic on August 1, 2016, in honor of MTV&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

* VH1 MegaHits: A channel which played mostly top 40 adult contemporary videos from throughout VH1&#x27;s history, from the 1980s to the early 2000s. Due to low viewership, the network was discontinued. The satellite space was utilized by MTV Networks to launch Logo.
* VH1 Soul: Classic and neo-soul music videos from the past and today. Rebranded as BET Soul under BET on December 28, 2015.

=== Internet ===

VH1&#x27;s website launched in the mid-1990s. In 2003, MTV Networks &quot;VSPOT&quot;, a broadband video channel that followed the model of MTV Overdrive, containing the shows aired by VH1 and music videos. Like Overdrive, it was coolly received due to a heavy reliance on broadband and advanced web technologies. VH1 returned to a traditional-style website in late 2007.

=== International networks ===

As with other MTV channels, Paramount Global has broadcast international versions of VH1, besides VH1 India they all closed down however:
* VH1 Adria: By the end of September 2012, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Croatia got their regional version of VH1 called VH1 Adria. However, due to financial issues, the channel closed in January 2015 and was replaced by the feed of VH1 Europe.

* VH1 India: In December 2004, MTV India and Zee-Turner teamed up to bring VH1 to India (later owned by Viacom18). It is the only version of VH1 that currently uses the 2003 branding. It also airs MTV international shows due to MTV India only airing Indian originals.

<text>Limburg-Weilburg is a Kreis (district) in the west of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Lahn-Dill, Hochtaunuskreis, Rheingau-Taunus, Rhein-Lahn, Westerwaldkreis.

==History==
*1867 the &quot;Oberlahnkreis&quot;, capital Weilburg was created
*1886 the district &quot;Limburg an der Lahn&quot;, capital Limburg created.
*1974 both districts were merged due to the district reorganization in Hesse.

==Geography==
The district is located between the two mountain areas Westerwald and Taunus. The main river is the Lahn, a tributary of the Rhine.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms consists of the main symbols of the two precursor districts. The cross from the district Limburg, symbolizing both Saint George the patron of the cathedral in Limburg, as well as the bishops of Trier who acquired the Limburg area in the 14th century. The chequered bar inside the cross derives from the Counts of Limburg of the 15th century. The lion in the inescutcheon, which was one of the symbols in the coat of arms of the Oberlahn district, is the lion of Nassau, as the area belonged to the Duchy of Nassau.

<text>A communist state, also known as a Marxist–Leninist state, is a one-party state in which the totality of the power belongs to a party adhering to some form of Marxism–Leninism, a branch of the communist ideology. Marxism–Leninism was the state ideology of the Soviet Union, the Comintern after its Bolshevisation, and the communist states within the Comecon, the Eastern Bloc, and the Warsaw Pact. After the peak of Marxism–Leninism, when many communist states were established, the Revolutions of 1989 brought down most of the communist states; however, Communism remained the official ideology of the ruling parties of China, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and to a lesser extent, North Korea. During the later part of the 20th century, before the Revolutions of 1989, around one-third of the world&#x27;s population lived in communist states.

Communist states are typically authoritarian and are typically administered through democratic centralism by a single centralised communist party apparatus. These parties are usually Marxist–Leninist or some national variation thereof such as Maoism or Titoism. There have been several instances of communist states with functioning political participation (i.e. Soviet democracy) processes involving several other non-party organisations such as direct democratic participation, factory committees, and trade unions, although the communist party remained the centre of power.

As a term, &quot;communist state&quot; is used by Western historians, political scientists, and media to refer to these countries. However, these states do not describe themselves as communist nor do they claim to have achieved communism — they refer to themselves as socialist states that are in the process of constructing socialism and progressing toward a communist society. Other terms used by communist states include &quot;national-democratic&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s democratic&quot;, &quot;socialist-oriented,&quot; and &quot;workers and peasants&#x27;&quot; states. Academics, political commentators, and other scholars tend to distinguish between communist states and democratic socialist states, with the first representing the Eastern Bloc and the latter representing Western Bloc countries that have been democratically governed by socialist parties such as France, Sweden, and Western social-democracies in general, among others.

== Overview ==
=== Development ===

During the 20th century, the world&#x27;s first constitutionally communist state was Soviet Russia at the end of 1917. In 1922, it joined other former territories of the empire to become the Soviet Union. After World War II, the Soviet Army occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped bring the existing communist parties to power in those countries. Originally, the communist states in Eastern Europe were allied with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia would declare itself non-aligned, and Albania later took a different path. After a war against Japanese occupation and a civil war resulting in a Communist victory, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed after the Iron Curtain broke under public pressure during a wave of mostly non-violent movements as part of the Revolutions of 1989 which led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. China&#x27;s socio-economic structure has been referred to as &quot;nationalistic state capitalism&quot; and the Eastern Bloc (Eastern Europe and the Third World) as &quot;bureaucratic-authoritarian systems.&quot;

Today, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and North Korea (DPRK). These states do not claim to have achieved communism in their countries but to be building and working toward its establishment. The preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam&#x27;s Constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the communist party in 1976 and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the communist party is to &quot;guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism.&quot; The DPRK&#x27;s constitution outlines a socialist economy and the ruling Workers&#x27; Party of Korea remains ideologically committed to communism.

=== Institutions ===
Communist states share similar institutions, which are organised on the premise that the communist party is a vanguard of the proletariat and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of democratic centralism, developed by Vladimir Lenin as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large. According to democratic centralism, the people must elect all leaders, and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached, all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a one-party system. The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy. They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of representative parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a separation of powers and instead have one national legislative body (such as the Supreme Soviet in the Soviet Union), which is bestowed with unitary power and is often defined as the highest organ of state power. Unitary power means that the legislature has the power of the judiciary, legislature and executive but chooses to delegate these powers to other institutions.

In communist states, the unitary legislatures often have a similar structure to the parliaments in liberal republics, with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these unitary legislatures are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against Karl Marx&#x27;s advice, the unitary legislatures of communist states are not in permanent session. Instead, they convene once or several times yearly in sessions that usually last only a few days. When the unitary legislature is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a presidium) which acts as a collective head of state. In some systems, the presidium is composed of crucial communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.

A feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organisations (associations of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, consumer cooperatives, sports clubs, trade unions, youth organisations, and women&#x27;s organisations) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organisations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for the recruitment of new communist party members.

Historically, the political organisation of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in China, Czechoslovakia, or East Germany have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.

== State ==
According to Marxist–Leninist thought, the state is a repressive institution led by a ruling class. This class dominates the state and expresses its will through it. By formulating law, the ruling class uses the state to oppress other classes and form a class dictatorship. However, the goal of the communist state is to abolish that state. The Soviet Russia Constitution of 1918 stated: &quot;The principal object of the Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R., which is adapted to the present transition period, consists in the establishment of a dictatorship of the urban and rural proletariat and the poorest peasantry, in the form of a powerful All-Russian Soviet power; the object of which is to secure complete suppression of the bourgeoisie, the abolition of exploitation of man by man, and the establishment of Socialism, under which there shall be neither class division nor state authority&quot;. The communist state is the dictatorship of the proletariat, where the advanced elements of the proletariat are the ruling class. In Marxist–Leninist thinking, the socialist state is the last repressive state since the next stage of development is that of pure communism, a classless and stateless society. Friedrich Engels commented on the state, writing: &quot;State interference in social relations, becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not &#x27;abolished&#x27;. It dies out.&quot;

In &quot;The Tax in Kind&quot;, Vladimir Lenin argued: &quot;No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of Russia, has denied its transitional character. Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the term Soviet Socialist Republic implies the determination of the Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, and not that the existing economic system is recognised as a socialist order.&quot; The introduction of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent. However, Joseph Stalin warned that the withering away of the state would not occur until after the socialist mode of production had achieved dominance over capitalism. Soviet jurist Andrey Vyshinsky echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary &quot;in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants.&quot;

Ideology permeates these states. According to scholar Peter Tang, &quot;[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology.&quot; Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states is to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism–Leninism. The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism–Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism–Leninism (Maoist China–Albania model). The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use in China.

Marxism–Leninism was mentioned in the Soviet constitution. Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet constitution stated: &quot;The Communist Party, armed with Marxism–Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR.&quot; This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: &quot;In the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism–Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles.&quot; The 1975 Chinese constitution had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that &quot;Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation.&quot; The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as &quot;building socialism and communism&quot;, &quot;on the road to communism&quot;, &quot;to build the material and technical basis of communism&quot; and &quot;to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations&quot; in the preamble.

=== People&#x27;s democratic state ===
The people&#x27;s democratic state was implemented in Eastern Europe after World War II. It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport, and credit eclipse it.

In the words of Eugene Varga, &quot;the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country.&quot; Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: &quot;People&#x27;s democracy in the people&#x27;s republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense, we call it popular.&quot;

=== People&#x27;s republican state ===
The people&#x27;s republican state is a socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with populist movements in the 19th century, such as the German Völkisch movement and the Narodniks in Russia, it is now associated with communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during World War I and its aftermath called themselves people&#x27;s republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former Russian Empire following the October Revolution.

Additional people&#x27;s republics emerged following the Allied victory in World War II, mainly within the Soviet Union&#x27;s Eastern Bloc. In Asia, China became a people&#x27;s republic following the Chinese Communist Revolution and North Korea also became a people&#x27;s republic.

During the 1960s, Romania and Yugoslavia ceased to use the term &quot;people&#x27;s republic&quot; in their official name, replacing it with the term &quot;socialist republic&quot; as a mark of their ongoing political development. Czechoslovakia also added the term &quot;socialist republic&quot; into its name during this period; it had become a people&#x27;s republic in 1948, but the country had not used that term in its official name. Albania used both terms in its official name from 1976 to 1991.

=== National-democratic state ===
The concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the capitalist mode of production. While Vladimir Lenin first articulated the theory of non-capitalist development, the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the national liberation movements in the Third World. The term &quot;national-democratic state&quot; was introduced shortly after the death of Stalin, who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement had few prospects there.

The countries where the national liberation movements took power and instituted an anti-imperialist foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered national-democratic states by Marxist–Leninists. An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser which was committed to constructing Arab socialism. Except Cuba, none of these states developed socialism. According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state &quot;never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system.&quot; However, one feature was clearly defined, namely, that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist–Leninist party.

=== Socialist-oriented state ===
A socialist-oriented state seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development. As a term, it substantially differs from the concept of the national-democratic state. The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages: a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and a people&#x27;s democratic socialist-oriented state. Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states. Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are Algeria, ruled by the National Liberation Front, Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, and Socialist Burma. In contrast, people&#x27;s democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism–Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism–Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as African socialism.

The socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely, they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction, and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people&#x27;s democratic). The political goal of revolutionary democracy is to create the conditions for socialism in countries where the social, political, and economic conditions for socialism do not exist. The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist–Leninist ideology. While introduced in these states, democratic centralism is rarely upheld.

Unlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class, and socialism, where the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence. Since peasants were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role was emphasised—similar to the working class in other socialist states. However, Marxist–Leninists admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the military in Ethiopia. The establishment of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state. The fifth feature is that the socialist-oriented state must take over the media and educational system while establishing mass organisations to mobilize the populace. Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are mixed economies that seek to attract foreign capital and which seeks to maintain and develop the private sector. In the words of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, these states were in the process of taking over the commanding heights of the economy and instituting a state-planned economy. According to Soviet sources, Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.

=== Socialist state ===
A socialist state is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a socialist economy. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist form of government before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people&#x27;s democracies (a developmental stage between capitalism and socialism). Regarding the Marxist–Leninist-ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them socialist states—referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist–Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a communist party that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country. It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist–Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.

== The state system of unitary power ==
=== Legislatures as the highest organ of state power ===

All communist political systems practice unitary state power. This means that the legislature, usually defined as the highest organ of state power, has executive, legislative and judicial power and can interfere in these organs as long as the law does not illegalise it. This is because both Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of bourgeois democracy, but neither sought to abolish the legislature as an institution. Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop proletarian democracy &quot;without representative institutions.&quot; Both of them considered the governing model of the Paris Commune of 1871, in which executive and legislative were combined in one body, to be ideal. More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by &quot;universal suffrage in the various wards and towns.&quot; While the institution of such a legislature might not be important in itself, they &quot;have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored—in the language of the party&#x27;s intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the mass line and learning from the people.&quot; This reasoning gives communist legislatures the right to interfere in every state institution unless the legislature itself has made a law that bars it from it. This also means there are no limits to politicisation, unlike in liberal democracies, where politicians are legally barred from interfering in judicial work. This is a firm rejection of the separation of powers found in liberal democracies since no institution can legally enforce checks and balances on the communist legislature. The legislature passes the constitution, which can only be amended by the legislature. Soviet legal theorists denounced judicial review and extra-parliamentary review as bourgeoisie institutions. They also perceived it as a limitation of the people&#x27;s supreme power. The legislature, together with its , oversaw the constitutional order. Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature&#x27;s acts cannot be unconstitutional. Moreover, this means that judicial independence in communist states does not mean the same as in liberal democracies. In communist states, judicial independence means stopping all interference not granted by law, but interference in itself is not barred.

The Supreme Soviet was the first socialist legislature, and the Soviet legislative system was introduced in all communist states. The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world&#x27;s first frequently-convened legislatures during its existence. The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries and modern-day China. China&#x27;s legislature, the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), is modelled on the Soviet one. As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a Standing Committee (the Soviets had a Presidium), the government (named the State Council in China and the Council of Ministers in the Soviet Union), the Supreme Court (such as the Supreme Court of East Germany), the Supreme Procuratorate (such as the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuracy of Vietnam), the Chairman of the National Defence Council (for example, the Chairman of the Council for National Defense and Security of Vietnam), National Supervisory institutions (such as the Director of China&#x27;s National Supervisory Commission) and other institutions if they exist. Moreover, in all communist states, the ruling party has either had a clear majority, such as China or held every seat as they did in the Soviet Union, in their Supreme Soviet. A majority in the legislature ensures the centralised and unitary leadership of the central committee of the ruling Marxist–Leninist party over the state.

By having legislatures, the Marxist–Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the party&#x27;s leading role. They seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled. These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as ethnicity and language, &quot;yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials.&quot; Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation—they meet too infrequently for this to be the case. This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives the power to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency. Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: &quot;As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the &#x27;realm&#x27; ruled by (to stretch an analogy) &#x27;kings&#x27;. Members of the assemblies &#x27;represent&#x27; the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader &#x27;segment of society&#x27; [...] than the court itself.&quot; Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace—the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.

Ideologically, it has another function, namely, to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class but all social strata. Communist states are committed to establishing a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker, or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society. As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature &quot;must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas.&quot; It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them, it shows that communist states are committed to incorporating minorities and areas of the country by including them in the composition of the legislature. In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials. In this instance, it might mean that it is less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are. The members of such legislatures at central and local levels are usually either government or party officials, leading figures in their community, or national figures outside the communist party. This shows that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party&#x27;s policies and ideological development.

Furthermore, Western researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states. The reason is that there are no significant bodies of political socialisation compared to legislatures in liberal democracies. While political leaders in communist states are often elected as members of legislatures, these posts are not relevant to political advancement. The role of legislatures is different from country to country. In the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet did &quot;little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere&quot; while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.

==== Constitution ====
===== Role of constitutions =====
Marxist–Leninists view the constitution as a fundamental law and as an instrument of force. The constitution is the source of law and legality. Unlike in liberal democracies, the Marxist–Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state. To the contrary, a Marxist–Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state—believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class. Marxist–Leninists believe that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system. In this instance, it means that Marxist–Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies. This contrasts with the liberal conception of constitutionalism that &quot;law, rather than men, is supreme.&quot;

Unlike the relatively constant (and, in some instances, permanently fixed) nature of democratic constitutions, a Marxist–Leninist constitution is ever-changing. Andrey Vyshinsky, a Procurator General of the Soviet Union during the 1930s, notes that the &quot;Soviet constitutions represent the total of the historical path along which the Soviet state has travelled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life.&quot; That is, the constitution sums up what has already been achieved. This belief is also shared by the Chinese Communist Party, which argued that &quot;the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered.&quot; A constitution in a communist state has an end. The preamble of the 1954 Chinese constitution outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, &quot;step by step, to bring about the socialist industrialisation of the country and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and capitalist industry and commerce.&quot;

In communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society. The Marxist–Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society&#x27;s class structure, before enacting changes. Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist–Leninist legal theorists, including &quot;new democracy&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s democracy,&quot; and the &quot;primary stage of socialism&quot;. This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a novel constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.

With Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s repudiation of Stalin&#x27;s practices in the &quot;Secret Speech&quot; and the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s repudiation of certain Maoist policies, Marxist–Leninist legal theories began to emphasise &quot;the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order.&quot; Deng Xiaoping, not long after Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s death, noted that &quot;[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker.&quot; In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that &quot;the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can, or cannot do.&quot; These legal developments were echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law, which runs parallel to, and is distinct from, the liberal term of the same name. In the last years, this emphasis on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society&#x27;s development has been noted by the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who stated in 2013 that &quot;[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law.&quot;

===== Constitutional supervision =====
After Soviet Union general secretary Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision. These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature from circumvention by political leaders. Romania was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965. It was elected by the legislature, and leading jurists sat on the committee, but it was only empowered to advise the legislature. Keith Hand has commented that &quot;[i]t was not an effective institution in practice&quot;, being unable to prevent Nicolae Ceausescu&#x27;s emasculation of Romania&#x27;s Great National Assembly after the inauguration of the July Theses.

Hungary and Poland experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s. Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law, which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists. It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations, and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature. In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee, which &quot;was subordinate only to the USSR constitution.&quot; It was empowered &quot;to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents.&quot; If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee. While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored, and it failed to defend the constitution during the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Chinese leadership has argued against establishing any corresponding constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with the failed communist states of Europe. None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of any kind outside the existing framework until 2018, when the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress was bestowed the right of constitutional review.

=== Government as the highest administrative agency of state power ===
The government of communist states is usually defined as the &quot;executive organ of the highest state organ of power&quot; or as the &quot;highest administrative agency of state power&quot;. It functions as the executive organ of the legislature. This model has been introduced with variations in all communist states. For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the Council of Ministers and identical names were used for the governments of Albania, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its standing committee, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished. The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature, and in between sessions of the legislature, it reported to the legislature&#x27;s standing committee. The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.

In communist states, the government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations, and defense. The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania, with few exceptions. One exception was Czechoslovakia, where it had a president and not a collective head of state. Another exception was in Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.

=== Judicial organs and socialist law ===

In every communist state, the judicial and procuratorial bodies are organs of the legislature. For instance, China&#x27;s Supreme People&#x27;s Court is the &quot;legislative organ of governance that manages the judicial system in the name of the&quot; National People&#x27;s Congress, and through it, the Chinese Communist Party. These bodies are responsible to and report on their work to the legislature. For instance, the Prosecutor-General of Vietnam&#x27;s Supreme People&#x27;s Procuracy delivers an annual Work Report to the legislature, the National Assembly, every year. Moreover, all communist states have been established in countries with a civil law system. The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, German Empire, and Russian Empire—all of whom had a civil law legal system. Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain, while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements, and Vietnam used French law. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether socialist law is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition. Legal scholar Renè David wrote that the socialist legal system &quot;possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of Roman law.&quot; Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is &quot;an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law.&quot; Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system have identified the following features:
# The socialist law is to disappear with the withering away of the state.
# The rule of the Marxist–Leninist party.
# The socialist law is subordinate and reflects changes to the economic order (the absorption of private law by public law).
# The socialist law has a religious character.
# The socialist law is prerogative rather than normative.

Legal officials argue differently for their cases compared to Westerners. For instance, &quot;[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree.&quot; This changed with the introduction of the command economy, and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s. Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szabó acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that &quot;four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist, and socialist societies.&quot; Using the Marxist theory of historical materialism, Szabó argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences. In other words, law is a tool by the ruling class to govern. As Renè David notes, socialist jurists &quot;isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law.&quot; However, some socialist legal theorists, such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, &quot;[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as in certain writings of Western comparatists.&quot; In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different society.

Yugoslav jurist noted that a &quot;great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law&quot;, further stating that it is &quot;necessary and justified&quot; to put them to use if they are &quot;in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question.&quot; Importantly, socialist law had retained civil law institutions, methodology, and organisation. This can be discerned by the fact that East Germany retained the 1896 German civil code until 1976 while Poland used existing Austrian, French, German, and Russian civil codes until adoption of its own civil code in 1964. Scholar John Quigley wrote that &quot;[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes.&quot;

=== Military ===
==== Control ====
Communist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model, but in China, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam, the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, several differences exist between the statist (Soviet) and the party-state models (China). In the Soviet model, the Soviet armed forces was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defence policies. The party leader was &quot;ex officio&quot; the Chairman of the Council of Defense. Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces. The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed. The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the Ministry of Defense, a state organ that functioned &quot;with the authority of a department of the CPSU Central Committee.&quot; The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanisms at the centre to the company level in the field. Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and Komsomol organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retain control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content. The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense. The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.

In the Chinese party-state model, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) is a party institution. In the preamble of the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party, it is stated: &quot;The Communist Party of China (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and other people&#x27;s armed forces.&quot; The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao Zedong described the PLA&#x27;s institutional situation as follows: &quot;Every communist must grasp the truth, &#x27;Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.&#x27; Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party.&quot; The Central Military Commission (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party—it is an organ of the CCP Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People&#x27;s Congress. The CCP General Secretary is &quot;ex officio&quot; party CMC Chairman and the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is by right state CMC Chairman. The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical. The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defence policies. fifteen departments report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA. Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services, and counterespionage work.

==== Representation ====
Unlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance. This is the case in all communist states. The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its CPV Politburo since 1986. In the 1986–2006 period, active military figures sitting in the CPV Central Committee stood at an average of 9,2 per cent. Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the National Assembly) and other representative institutions. In China, the two CMC vice chairmen have had by right office seats in the CCP Politburo since 1987.

=== Ruling party ===
==== Leading role ====
A Marxist–Leninist party has led every communist state. This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by capitalism. It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism. However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general. Its membership comprises members with advanced consciousness above sectional interests. Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and, through them, leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.

In &quot;Foundations of Leninism&quot; (1924), Joseph Stalin wrote that &quot;the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship.&quot; The current Constitution of Vietnam states in Article 4 that &quot;[t]he Communist Party of Vietnam, the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist–Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s thought, is the leading force of the state and society.&quot; In a similar form, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) describes itself as &quot;the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation.&quot; As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are vanguard parties. Vladimir Lenin theorised that vanguard parties were &quot;capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organising their social life without the bourgeoisie.&quot; This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party&#x27;s leading role in leading the state as seen in the CCP&#x27;s self-description and Vietnam&#x27;s constitution.

==== Internal organisation ====
The Marxist–Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of democratic centralism and through it, the state too. It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organisations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.

The highest organ of a Marxist–Leninist governing party is the party congress. The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always. The central committee is the party&#x27;s highest decision-making organ in-between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members and the party&#x27;s leader. When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ. In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee, and the Congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.

== Economic system ==
From reading their works, many followers of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanisms. These ideas later developed into believing that planning was superior to the market mechanism. Upon seizing power, the Bolsheviks began advocating a national state planning system. The 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) resolved to institute &quot;the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan.&quot; The Gosplan, the State Planning Commission, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy, and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the New Economic Policy. On introducing the planning system, it became a common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organisation than capitalism. This led to the system being introduced voluntarily in countries such as China, Cuba, and Vietnam and, in some cases, imposed by the Soviet Union.

In communist states, the state planning system had five main characteristics. Firstly, except for field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top. Secondly, the system was hierarchical—the centre formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below, which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid. Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals outlined in them. Fourthly, the predominance of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production. Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.

According to Michael Ellman, in a centrally-planned economy, &quot;the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model, the enterprises, and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists but plays a subsidiary role and is expected to be temporary.&quot; The private ownership of the means of production still exists, although it plays a somewhat more minor role. Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, state ownership (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considered as a tool to end the class struggle and empower the working class.

== Analysis ==

Countries such as the Soviet Union and China were criticised by various authors and organisations based on the lack of the representative nature of multi-party liberal democracy, in addition to several other areas where socialist society and Western societies differed. Socialist societies were commonly characterised by state ownership or social ownership of the means of production either through administration through communist party organisations, democratically elected councils and communes, and co-operative structures—in opposition to the liberal democratic capitalist free-market paradigm of management, ownership and control by corporations and private individuals. Communist states have also been criticised for the influence and outreach of their respective ruling parties on society, in addition to lack of recognition for some Western legal rights and liberties such as the right to own property and the restriction of the right to free speech. The early economic development policies of communist states have been criticised for focusing primarily on the development of heavy industry.

Communist party rule has been criticized as authoritarian or totalitarian for suppressing and killing political dissidents and social classes (so-called &quot;enemies of the people&quot;), religious persecution, ethnic cleansing, forced collectivization, and use of forced labor in concentration camps. Communist party rule has also been accused of genocidal acts in Cambodia, China, Poland and Ukraine, although there is scholarly dispute regarding the Holodomor&#x27;s classification as genocide. Especially in the West, criticism of communist rule has also been grounded in criticism of socialism, by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who argued that the state ownership and planned economy characteristic of Soviet-style communist rule were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies, providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship. Anti-Stalinist left and other left-wing critics see it as an example of state capitalism and have referred to it as a &quot;red fascism&quot; contrary to left-wing politics. Other leftists, including Marxist–Leninists, criticize it for its repressive state actions while recognizing certain advancements such as egalitarian achievements and modernization under such states. Counter-criticism is diverse, including the view it presents a biased or exaggerated anti-communist narrative. Some academics propose a more nuanced analysis of communist party rule.

Soviet advocates and socialists responded to criticism by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of freedom. McFarland and Ageyev noted that &quot;Marxist–Leninist norms disparaged &quot;laissez-faire&quot; individualism (as when housing is determined by one&#x27;s ability to pay), also [condemning] wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not. Instead, Soviet ideals emphasized equality—free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth.&quot; When asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of communist states enjoy increased freedoms, Heinz Kessler, former East German Minister of National Defence, replied: &quot;Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security.&quot;

In his analysis of states run under Marxist–Leninist ideology, economist Michael Ellman of the University of Amsterdam notes that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy. A 1986 study published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; and a 1992 study published in &quot;International Journal of Health Services&quot; stated, respectively, that &quot;between countries at similar levels of economic development, socialist countries showed more favorable PQL (physical quality of life) outcomes&quot; and that socialism was &quot;for the most part, more successful than capitalism in improving the health conditions of the world&#x27;s populations.&quot; Philipp Ther posits that there was an increase in the standard of living throughout Eastern Bloc countries as the result of modernisation programs under communist governments. Similarly, Amartya Sen&#x27;s own analysis of international comparisons of life expectancy found that several Marxist–Leninist states made significant gains and commented &quot;one thought that is bound to occur is that communism is good for poverty removal.&quot;

Socialist scholar Michael Parenti argues that communist states experienced greater economic development than they would have otherwise, or that their leaders were forced to take harsh measures to defend their countries against the Western Bloc during the Cold War. In addition, Parenti states that communist party rule provided some human rights such as economic, social and cultural rights not found under capitalist states such as that everyone is treated equal regardless of education or financial stability; that any citizen can keep a job; or that there is a more efficient and equal distribution of resources. Professors Paul Greedy and Olivia Ball report that communist parties pressed Western governments to include economic rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Professor David L. Hoffmann argues that many actions of communist party rule were rooted in the response Western governments gave during World War I and that communist party rule institutionalized them. While noting &quot;its brutalities and failures&quot;, Milne argues that &quot;rapid industrialisation, mass education, job security and huge advances in social and gender equality&quot; are not accounted and the dominant account of communist party rule &quot;gives no sense of how communist regimes renewed themselves after 1956 or why western leaders feared they might overtake the capitalist world well into the 1960s.&quot;

===Left-wing criticism===

Left-wing critics argue that states under communist party rule took the form of state capitalism and that they followed anti-imperialism, populism, nationalism and social democracy. Rather than representing a socialist planned economy, the Soviet model has been described in practice as either a form of state capitalism or a non-planned, command economy. The fidelity of those varied socialist revolutionaries, leaders and parties to the work of Karl Marx and that of other socialist thinkers is highly contested and has been rejected by many Marxists and other socialists alike. Some academics, scholars and socialists have criticized the linking of all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of authoritarian socialism.

Many democratic and libertarian socialists, including anarchists, mutualists and syndicalists, refer to communist states as examples of state socialism, and they oppose this system for its support of a workers&#x27; state instead of abolishing the bourgeois state apparatus outright. They contrast state socialism with their own form of socialism which involves either collective ownership (in the form of worker cooperatives) or common ownership of the means of production without central planning by the state. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion, and they regard the state being a remnant of capitalism. They hold that statism is antithetical to true socialism. For instance, libertarian socialist William Morris wrote in a &quot;Commonweal&quot; article: &quot;State Socialism? — I don&#x27;t agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place&quot;.

American Marxist Raya Dunayevskaya dismissed communist states as a type of state capitalism because she believed that state ownership of the means of production represents state capitalism rather than socialism. the dictatorship of the proletariat is a form of democracy and single-party rule is undemocratic; She also argued that Marxism–Leninism is neither Marxism nor Leninism, but rather a composite ideology which socialist leaders such as Joseph Stalin used to expediently determine what is communism and what is not communism among the Eastern Bloc countries.

=== Memory ===
Monuments to the &quot;victims of communist states&quot; exist in almost all capitals of Eastern Europe. There are several museums documenting communist rule such as the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights in Lithuania, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia in Riga, and the House of Terror in Budapest, all three of which also document Nazi rule. In Washington D.C., a bronze statue based upon the 1989 Tiananmen Square &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; sculpture was dedicated as the Victims of Communism Memorial in 2007, having been authorized by the United States Congress in 1993. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation plans to build an International Museum on Communism in Washington. As of 2008, Russia contained 627 memorials and memorial plaques dedicated to victims of the communist states, most of which were created by private citizens and did not have a national monument or a national museum. The Wall of Grief in Moscow, inaugurated in October 2017, is Russia&#x27;s first monument for victims of political persecution by Stalin during the country&#x27;s Soviet era. In 2017, Canada&#x27;s National Capital Commission approved the design for a memorial to the victims of communism to be built at the Garden of the Provinces and Territories in Ottawa. On 23 August 2018, Estonia&#x27;s Victims of Communism 1940–1991 Memorial was inaugurated in Tallinn by President Kersti Kaljulaid. The memorial construction was financed by the state and is managed by the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory. The opening ceremony was chosen to coincide with the official European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.

According to Laure Neumayer, this is used as an anti-communist narrative &quot;based on a series of categories and figures&quot; to &quot;denounce Communist state violence (qualified as &#x27;Communist crimes&#x27;, &#x27;red genocide&#x27; or &#x27;classicide&#x27;) and to honour persecuted individuals (presented alternatively as &#x27;victims of Communism&#x27; and &#x27;heroes of anti totalitarian resistance&#x27;).&quot; According to anthropologist Kristen Ghodsee, efforts to institutionalize the victims of communism narrative, or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the push at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of the excesses of neoliberal capitalism. Ghodsee argues that any discussion of achievements under communist states, including literacy, education, women&#x27;s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin&#x27;s crimes and the double genocide theory.

In the decades following the Revolutions of 1989, nostalgia for the defunct Marxist governments and the communist ideal reemerged among segments of the population in the former Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe. Russian-American author and cultural theorist Svetlana Boym noted that outbreaks of nostalgia often follow periods of political change and revolution. She observed that in former communist states, memory narratives surrounding life under socialism may be polarized. Many residents who lived through this era recalled only economic stagnation, while others valued it for a sense of perceived stability and national strength.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union was followed by a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, infant mortality, domestic violence, and income inequality, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income. The region also experienced a spike in excess deaths.

According to Kristen Ghodsee, a researcher on post-communist Eastern Europe:
Ekaterina Kalinina, a sociologist at the University of Copenhagen, found that positive narratives of life under socialism was often driven by the loss of social benefits and the collapse of the extensive welfare state enjoyed by many residents of former communist states. Kalinina pointed out that nostalgia for the Soviet Union had the greatest appeal to those &quot;who find themselves in more vulnerable economic and social positions&quot; in Russia after 1991. Per Kalinina, these individuals are nostalgic for &quot;economic security and social welfare.&quot;

<text>The Pazzi were a powerful family in the Republic of Florence. Their main trade during the fifteenth century was banking. In the aftermath of the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478, members of the family were banished from Florence and their property was confiscated; the family name and coat-of-arms were permanently suppressed by order of the Signoria.

== History ==

The traditional story is that the family was founded by Pazzo di Ranieri, first man over the walls during the Siege of Jerusalem of 1099, during the First Crusade, who returned to Florence with flints supposedly from the Holy Sepulchre, which were kept at Santi Apostoli and used on Holy Saturday to re-kindle fire in the city. The historical basis of this legend has been in question since the work of in the mid-nineteenth century.

The first apparently historical figure in the family is the who was a captain of the Florentine (Guelph) cavalry at the battle of Montaperti on 4 September 1260, and whose hand was treacherously severed by , causing the standard to fall. His son was a Black Guelph and a follower of Charles de Valois.

Andrea di Guglielmo de&#x27; Pazzi (1372–1445) was a banker and merchant. In 1429 he commissioned construction of the Pazzi Chapel in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence. His son Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi became head of the family in 1464.

Guglielmo di Antonio de&#x27; Pazzi married Bianca de&#x27; Medici, sister of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, in 1460; , the sixth of their sixteen children, became archbishop of Florence in 1508.

Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi was one of the instigators of the Pazzi conspiracy in 1477–78. He, Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi and Jacopo&#x27;s brother Renato de&#x27; Pazzi were executed after the plot failed.

 was a condottiere; he died at the Battle of Ravenna in 1512.

Maria Maddalena de&#x27; Pazzi (1566–1607) was a Carmelite nun and mystic; she was canonised in 1669.

===Pazzi conspiracy===
Early in 1477, Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi, manager in Rome of the Pazzi bank, plotted with Girolamo Riario, nephew and &quot;protégé&quot; of the pope, Sixtus IV, and with Francesco Salviati, whom Sixtus had made archbishop of Pisa, to assassinate Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and his brother Giuliano to oust the Medici family as rulers of Florence. Sixtus gave tacit support to the conspirators. The assassination attempt was made during mass in the Florence Cathedral on 26 April 1478. Giuliano was killed; Lorenzo was wounded, but escaped. Salviati, with mercenaries from Perugia, failed in his attempt to take over the Palazzo della Signoria. Most of the conspirators were soon caught and summarily executed; five, including Francesco de&#x27; Pazzi, were hanged from the windows of the Palazzo della Signoria. Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi, head of the family, escaped from Florence, but was caught and brought back. He was tortured, then hanged from the Palazzo della Signoria next to the decomposing corpse of Salviati. He was buried at Santa Croce, but the body was dug up and thrown into a ditch. It was then dragged through the streets and propped up at the door of Palazzo Pazzi, where the rotting head was mockingly used as a door-knocker. From there it was thrown into the Arno; children fished it out and hung it from a willow tree, flogged it, and then threw it back into the river.

The Pazzi were banished from Florence, and their lands and property confiscated. Guglielmo de&#x27; Pazzi, husband of Lorenzo&#x27;s sister Bianca, was placed under house arrest, and later forbidden to enter the city; he went to live at Torre a Decima, near Pontassieve. The family name and coat-of-arms were perpetually suppressed by decree of the Signoria. The name was erased from public registers, and all buildings and streets carrying it were renamed. Their shield with its dolphins was obliterated. Anyone named Pazzi had to take a new name; any man married to a Pazzi was barred from public office. Customs and traditions of the family were suppressed, among them the Easter Saturday ritual involving the flint from Jerusalem.

After the overthrow of Piero de&#x27; Medici in 1494, members of the Pazzi family were able to return to Florence.

== Buildings ==
The Pazzi Chapel in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence was commissioned by Andrea di Guglielmo de&#x27; Pazzi in 1429. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi. Construction began in 1442 in a cloister of the church, and continued after the death of the patron in 1445 and the architect in 1446; work was interrupted by the Pazzi plot and the chapel was never completed.
Palazzo Pazzi or Palazzo Pazzi-Quaratesi was the main seat of the family in the &quot;Canto dei Pazzi&quot;, at the intersection of and . It was commissioned by Jacopo de&#x27; Pazzi, and built circa 1462–1472 to designs by Giuliano da Maiano. Above its traditionally rusticated ground floor of yellow-ochre sandstone, it had a then-novel stuccoed first and second floor, with delicate designs in the windows influenced by Brunelleschi. The central court is surrounded on three sides by round-headed arcading, with circular bosses in the spandrels.

 (or Palazzo Pazzi dell&#x27;Accademia Colombaria) is a smaller palace in the Borgo degli Albizi, between Palazzo Ramirez de Montalvo and the Palazzo Nonfinito. It houses a section of the Museum of Natural History of Florence, and hosts temporary exhibitions. The façade is attributed to Bartolomeo Ammannati.

<doc id="215626" wikidata="Q2250014" url="?curid=215626" title="Gilbert Burnet">
<text>Gilbert Burnet (18 September 1643 – 17 March 1715) was a Scottish philosopher and historian, and Bishop of Salisbury. He was fluent in Dutch, French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Burnet was highly respected as a cleric, a preacher, an academic, a writer and a historian. He was always closely associated with the Whig party, and was one of the few close friends in whom King William III confided.

==Early life: 1643–1674==

Burnet was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1643, the son of Robert Burnet, Lord Crimond, a Royalist and Episcopalian lawyer, who became a judge of the Court of Session, and of his second wife Rachel Johnston, daughter of James Johnston, and sister of Archibald Johnston of Warristoun, a leader of the Covenanters. His father was his first tutor until he began his studies at the University of Aberdeen, where he earned a Master of Arts in Philosophy at the age of thirteen. He studied law briefly before changing to theology. He did not enter into the ministry at that time, but travelled for several years. He visited Oxford, Cambridge, London, the United Provinces and France. He studied Hebrew under a Rabbi in Amsterdam. By 1665 he returned to Scotland and was ordained in the Church of Scotland (then episcopal) by the bishop of Edinburgh. In 1664 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He began his ministry in the rural church at East Saltoun, East Lothian, and served this community devoutly for four years. In 1669, without his being asked, he was named to the vacant chair of Divinity at the University of Glasgow. At first he declined, since his congregation unanimously asked him to remain at East Saltoun; but, when the Bishop of Edinburgh, Leighton, urged him, he accepted the post. He was later offered, but declined, a Scottish bishopric.

In 1672 or 1673 he privately married Lady Margaret Kennedy, daughter of the Earl of Cassilis, who was many years his senior. The great differences between the couple in age, rank and fortune caused them to keep the marriage secret for a considerable time. Burnet&#x27;s motives for marriage were certainly not mercenary, as he entered into what has been described as an early form of &quot;pre-nuptial agreement&quot; by which he renounced any claim to his wife&#x27;s money. Burnet himself recalled that they had been good friends for several years, but that in his view such a close friendship between a single man and a single woman could not continue indefinitely unless they married. The marriage seems to have been happy, despite their lack of children, which Burnet regretted. He was to have numerous children by later marriages.

==London: 1674–1685==
In view of the unsettled political times, he left the university in 1674 and moved to London. In London, his political and religious sentiments prompted him to support the Whigs. His energetic and bustling character led him to take an active part in the controversies of the time, and he endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation between Episcopacy and Presbytery.

At Court, where his brother Thomas was a royal physician, he gained the favour of Charles II, from whom he received various preferments. He described Charles shrewdly as a man who, despite his affable manner and famed courtesy, was at heart the archetypal cynic: &quot;he has a very ill opinion of men and women, and so is infinitely distrustful... he thinks the world is governed wholly by (self) interest&quot;. Burnet noted fairly that this attitude was quite understandable, given the King&#x27;s experiences in the English Civil War and the Interregnum, which had shown him when he was still very young the &quot;baseness of human nature&quot;. Like many other observers he noted Charles&#x27;s remarkable self-control: &quot;he has a strange command of himself: he can pass from business to pleasure, and from pleasure to business, in so easy a manner that all things seem alike to him.&quot; He also recorded some of the King&#x27;s most memorable sayings, such as &quot;Appetites are free, and Almighty God will never damn a man for allowing himself a little pleasure&quot;.

===The Popish Plot===

During the Popish Plot, when Queen Catherine was accused of treason, (it was alleged that she had conspired to murder her husband), the King confided to Burnet his feelings of guilt about his ill-treatment of the Queen, &quot;who is incapable of doing a wicked thing&quot;, his resolve not to abandon her (&quot;it would be a horrible thing, considering my faultiness to her&quot;), and his wish to live a more moral life in future. Burnet, for his part, told the King frankly that he was wrong to believe that the Earl of Shaftesbury had any part in the charges of treason made against the Queen: Shaftesbury, who was well aware of the Queen&#x27;s great popularity with the English ruling class, was simply too shrewd a statesman to make such a serious political misjudgment.

As regards the reality of the Plot itself, while the King quickly became a total sceptic on the subject, Burnet probably captures Charles&#x27;s first reaction to the accusations neatly enough: &quot;among so many particulars I do not know but there may be some truth.&quot; Burnet himself was neither a sceptic, nor a convinced believer in the Plot. Like most sensible Protestants he believed that there had probably been a Catholic conspiracy of some sort, but he had grave doubts about the veracity of the informers, especially Titus Oates, while he regarded Israel Tonge, the co-author of the Plot, as insane. He recognised the danger that innocent people might be falsely accused, and it is notable that he praised the Catholic martyr Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh, who is nowadays probably the best-known victim of the Plot, as a good and innocent man who was destroyed by the malice of his personal enemies. He also argued strongly that the first victim of the Plot, the young Catholic banker William Staley, was innocent, although his narrative of Staley&#x27;s trial was undoubtedly coloured by his detestation of William Carstares, the Crown&#x27;s chief witness at Staley&#x27;s trial. Whether the Catholic nobleman William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, executed for treason in 1680, was innocent or guilty he regarded as a mystery whose solution must await &quot;the great revelation of all secrets&quot;.

==&quot;History of the Reformation&quot;==

In the mid-1670s, a French translation of Nicholas Sanders&#x27; (1585) appeared. Sanders attacked the English Reformation as a political act carried on by a corrupt king. Several of Burnet&#x27;s friends wished him to publish a rebuttal of the work, so in 1679 his first volume of &quot;The History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot; was published. This covered the reign of Henry VIII; the second volume (1681) covered the reign of Elizabeth and the Elizabethan Religious Settlement; the third volume (1715) consisted of corrections and additional material. His literary reputation was greatly enhanced by this publication. The Parliament of England voted thanks for Burnet after the publication of the first volume, and in 1680 the University of Oxford awarded Burnet the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the advice of William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury. For over a century this was the standard reference work in the field, although Catholics disputed some of its content.

;Initial publication of the three volumes of the &quot;History of the Reformation&quot;

These early editions of Gilbert Burnet&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot; were all published in London:

* 1679 : first edition of Volume 1, that is, &quot;The First Part, of the Progress made in it during the Reign of K. Henry the VIII&quot;. London: Richard Chiswell. 
* 1681 : second edition of Volume 1. London: Richard Chiswell. 
* 1681 : first edition of Volume 2, that is, &quot;The Second Part, of the Progress made in it till the Settlement of it in the beginning of Q. Elizabeths Reign&quot;. London: Richard Chiswell. 
* 1683 : second edition of Volume 2. London: Richard Chiswell.
* 1714 : &quot;An Introduction to the Third Volume of The History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot;. London: John Churchill. 72 pages. The text of this &quot;Introduction&quot; was reprinted the following year in Volume 3.
* 1715 : first edition of Volume 3, that is, &quot;The Third Part. Being Supplement to the Two Volumes formerly publish&#x27;d&quot;. London: John Churchill. 
* 1715 : fourth edition of Volume 1. London: Daniel Midwinter; and Benjamin Cowse.
* 1715 : fourth edition of Volume 2. London: Daniel Midwinter; and Benjamin Cowse.

Although a &quot;fourth&quot; edition was published in 1715 by Midwinter and by Cowse, a third edition of these volumes was neither prepared nor published by Burnet.

==Exile: 1685–1688==
Upon the succession of the Roman Catholic King James II in 1685, Burnet requested permission to go abroad, to which request James heartily consented. Burnet left on 11 May and reached Paris at the end of that month. He then travelled through Switzerland to Italy, where Pope Innocent XI offered him an audience, which Burnet declined on account of his poor knowledge of the Italian language. We cannot know whether a personal meeting with the Pope would have altered Burnet&#x27;s low opinion of him (in his &quot;History&quot; he describes Innocent as &quot;jealous, fearful and extremely ignorant,&quot; a view not shared by most later historians). After more months of travelling across France, Switzerland and Germany he arrived at Utrecht, Netherlands, in May 1686. He was sent letters from the court of William, Prince of Orange, and his wife Princess Mary inviting him to take up residence at The Hague. This courting of Burnet infuriated James and under his pressure he was formally dismissed from court, but still kept in contact with William and Mary. It was Burnet who pointed out that William&#x27;s marriage to Mary did not in itself entitle him to reign jointly with her if she became Queen, and that further steps would be necessary to ensure his right to the throne.

In 1687, in light of James&#x27;s policy of wanting to receive William and Mary&#x27;s support for the repeal of the Test Act, Burnet wrote a pamphlet against repeal. William and Mary declined to support repeal, apparently on Burnet&#x27;s advice. Burnet also upset James by becoming engaged to the wealthy heiress Mary (Maria) Scott (his first wife Lady Margaret had died in 1685). James prosecuted Burnet for high treason in Scotland, accusing him of corresponding with Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, and others convicted of high treason. To safeguard Burnet, the States General of the Netherlands naturalised him without opposition, and James&#x27;s request for Burnet&#x27;s extradition was declined. Burnet and Mary Scott were married and the marriage proved to be a happy one. Burnet, who had long been resigned to being childless since as his first wife Lady Margaret Kennedy had been nearly twenty years his senior, quickly found himself the father of a growing family.

He translated an open letter written by Gaspar Fagel, William&#x27;s grand pensionary, setting out a policy of lifting disabilities on non-conformists while retaining them on Catholics, which provided an alternative to the dissenters of an alliance with James&#x27;s court.

Burnet was not privy to William&#x27;s decision-making process because he was apparently unable to keep a secret; he was not, for example, informed of William&#x27;s planned invasion of England until July 1688. However, his help was needed to translate William&#x27;s &quot;Declaration&quot; which was to be distributed in England after his landing. When William&#x27;s fleet set sail for England in October 1688, Burnet was made William&#x27;s chaplain.

==Glorious Revolution==
William landed at Torbay on 5 November.
When Burnet came ashore he hastened to William and eagerly inquired of him what William now intended to do. William regarded the interference in military matters by non-military personnel with disgust, but he was in good humour at this moment, and responded with a delicate reproof: &quot;Well, Doctor, what do you think of predestination now?&quot;

Burnet was appointed to preach the coronation sermon, on 11 April 1689.

He was appointed tutor to the future Queen Anne&#x27;s only surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, in 1698. He attempted to refuse the appointment, knowing that Anne, who instinctively disliked anyone whom William favored, was strongly opposed to it, but the King was adamant, despite Burnet&#x27;s plea that he was still in mourning for his second wife Mary Scott, who had recently died of smallpox while on a visit to Rotterdam. The appointment was unwelcome to most of Anne&#x27;s household as well as to the Princess herself, but as Burnet recalled cheerfully, &quot;I lived with them well enough.&quot; He was well known for having no feelings to be hurt. After Mary&#x27;s death, Burnet, in 1700, married, as his third wife, Elizabeth Berkeley (née Blake): his choice of her met with general approval, as Elizabeth had been Mary&#x27;s best friend, and Mary herself had told her husband that should he outlive her, she would wish him to marry Elizabeth.

==Bishop of Salisbury==
At Easter 1689, Burnet was consecrated Bishop of Salisbury and three days later was sworn as Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. His tenure as bishop is noted for his liberal views and zealous discharge of duty. 

==Under Queen Anne==
He was present at King William&#x27;s deathbed, and with that knack for appearing absurd which sometimes detracted from his genuine gifts, he rushed in haste to be the first to break the news to the new Queen, and went on his knees in front of her, only to find himself &quot;generally laughed at&quot;. He was out of royal favour in the reign of Queen Anne: apart from Anne&#x27;s reflexive hostility to anyone whom King William had favoured, she apparently thought Burnet to be something of a buffoon, although he could sometimes be an entertaining one. Nonetheless, like her four royal predecessors, she occasionally confided in him. In 1713 he warned her of an impending Jacobite invasion: the Queen, unimpressed, noted drily that while Burnet apparently considered himself to be all-knowing, she could not help recalling that he had made a similar prophecy the previous year, which had proved to be entirely groundless.

He was nominated by John Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury, to write answers to the works sponsored by Tillotson&#x27;s friend, the Socinian businessman and philanthropist Thomas Firmin, who was funding the printing of Socinian tracts by Stephen Nye. Yet neither Burnet nor Tillotson was entirely unsympathetic to non-conformism. Of the Athanasian Creed, the new Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to the new Bishop of Salisbury, &quot;I wish we were well rid of it&quot;.

==Last years and death==

In 1714, as Queen Anne approached death, Burnet became briefly, and in the opinion of his critics, somewhat hysterically concerned about the dire consequences for Protestants if her Catholic half-brother, the Old Pretender, succeeded to the throne. His predictions of doom were received with general scepticism: &quot;Be easy my Lord, and disturb not the peace of your old age with vain imaginings of a second Revolution and a flight to Holland... I am sure you need not die a martyr for your faith&quot;, wrote one correspondent acidly. In the event, the throne passed peacefully to the Protestant House of Hanover in August 1714, seven months before Burnet&#x27;s own death.

Burnet died of a fever on 17 March 1715, having been ill for only three days. His mood in his final days was described as being calm, cheerful and absolutely resigned to death. His will has been called one of those rare dispositions of one&#x27;s property which please everyone: one-third of his estate was left to his eldest son and the rest was divided among the other four children. What happened to his daughter Elizabeth&#x27;s share of the money is something of a puzzle, as she is known to have spent her last years in poverty.

==&quot;History of His Own Time&quot;==
Burnet began &quot;Bishop Burnet&#x27;s History of His Own Time&quot; in 1683, covering the English Civil War and the Commonwealth of England to the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. The first volume was published in 1724, ending before the Glorious Revolution. In 1734 the second volume was published, taking the &quot;History&quot; to the Treaty of Utrecht. A critical edition in six volumes with numerous footnotes was edited by Martin Routh and published by Oxford University Press in 1823 (updated 1833). The work gives a sketch of the history of the Civil Wars and Commonwealth, and a detailed account of the immediately succeeding period down to 1713. While not free from egotism and some party feeling, it is written with a sincere desire for accuracy and fairness, and it has largely the authority of an eyewitness. The style, if somewhat lacking in dignity, is lively and picturesque.

A supplemental biography of Burnet, titled &quot;A Supplement to Burnet&#x27;s History of my Own Time&quot; and edited by H. C. Foxcroft and T. E. S. Clarke, was published in 1902.

==Theology==
After 1664, Burnet developed relations with the Dutch Arminians, with among them Jean Le Clerc, and Philipp van Limborch. He then rejected his Calvinist soteriology for an Arminian one. Besides, Gilbert is counted among the Latitudinarian divines with distinctive theological characteristics of thought. In particular he was attacked for his latitude in the interpretation of the Thirty-Nine Articles which could encompass an Arminian reading.

Among his works is &quot;Lives, characters, and an address to posterity&quot;.

==Family==
He married three times, firstly, to Lady Margaret Kennedy, daughter of John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis and his wife Lady Jean Hamilton. Margaret was a lady famous for her beauty and strength of character, and was many years older than her husband. The marriage was kept secret for some time, and Gilbert renounced any claim to his wife&#x27;s fortune. She is said to have lost her memory completely some time before she died in 1685.

He was married, secondly, in 1687 to Mary Scott (Maria Schotte) (1660–1698), a Dutch heiress of Scots descent: she was a granddaughter of the prominent statesman and jurist Apollonius Schotte. Although Mary brought him a fortune, it was generally regarded as a love match on both sides: Mary, whose wealth gave her an unusual degree of freedom for a woman of her time, had always maintained that she would only marry a man she really cared for. She died of smallpox while visiting Rotterdam on business in 1698.

He married, thirdly, in 1700 Elizabeth Berkeley (née Blake), widow of Robert Berkeley, and daughter of Sir Richard Blake of Clerkenwell; she was a religious writer of some note. She died in 1709. This marriage was largely the work of Burnet&#x27;s second wife Mary, who, apprehensive that she might die on her last visit to Rotterdam, where the smallpox was raging, advised Burnet in the event of her death to marry Elizabeth, who was a close friend of hers.

All his surviving children were by Mary Scott; Elizabeth bore two daughters who died young.

By Mary he had five sons of whom two died young. The three surviving sons were:

*William Burnet, the Royal governor of New Jersey (1720–1728), and later of Massachusetts and New Hampshire;
* Gilbert Burnet, the pamphleteer;
*Thomas Burnet, judge of the Court of Common Pleas

He and Mary also had twin daughters :

* Mary, who married David Mitchell, nephew and heir of Admiral Sir David Mitchell.
* Elizabeth, who married Richard West, a distinguished lawyer who became Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by whom she was the mother of Richard West the younger, the poet and friend of Thomas Gray.

Burnet was a devoted parent and all his children were deeply attached to him. Even Thomas, whose youthful reputation for debauchery caused his father much distress, sincerely mourned &quot;the best of fathers&quot;.

Influential close relatives include Burnet&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother Archibald Johnston and his son James Johnston.

==Personality==
Thomas Babington Macaulay describes Burnet in relation to the king he served, William of Orange:
When the doctor took liberties, which was not seldom the case, his patron became more than usually cold and sullen, and sometimes uttered a short dry sarcasm which would have struck dumb any person of ordinary assurance. In spite of such occurrences, however, the amity between this singular pair continued, with some temporary interruptions, till it was dissolved by death. Indeed it was not easy to wound Burnet&#x27;s feelings. His self-complacency, his animal spirits, and his want of tact, were such that, though he frequently gave offence, he never took it. —&quot;History of England&quot;, Vol. 2, Ch 7.

In J.P. Kenyon&#x27;s view Burnet&#x27;s great gifts never quite received the recognition they deserved, perhaps because there was always &quot;something of the buffoon&quot; about him.

<text>Terence Henry Stamp (born 22 July 1938) is an English actor. Known for his sophisticated villain roles, he was named by &quot;Empire&quot; as one of the 100 Sexiest Film Stars of All Time in 1995. He has received various accolades including a Golden Globe Award, a Cannes Film Festival Award, and a Silver Bear as well as nominations for an Academy Award and two BAFTA Awards.

After training at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London, Stamp started his acting career in 1960 in the Wolf Mankowitz production of &quot;This Year Next Year&quot; at the West End&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre. He was called the &quot;master of the brooding silence&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. His performance in the title role of &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, his film debut, earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA nomination for Best Newcomer. Associated with the Swinging London scene of the 1960s – during which time he was in high-profile relationships with actress Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton – Stamp was among the subjects photographed by David Bailey for a set titled &quot;Box of Pin-Ups&quot;. He starred opposite Christie in &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967), and also had a leading role in Ken Loach&#x27;s drama &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967).

Stamp gained wider fame for his role as archvillain General Zod in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980). For his leading role in &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994) he earned BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. He then starred in &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999) earning an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Other films include &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; (2003), &quot;Elektra&quot; (2005), &quot;Wanted&quot; (2008), &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008), &quot;Yes Man&quot; (2008), &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008), &quot;Big Eyes&quot; (2014) and &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Stamp, the eldest of five children, was born on 22 July 1938 in Stepney, London, England, the son of Ethel Esther (née Perrott; 1914–1985) and Thomas Stamp (1913–1982), who was a tugboat stoker. His early years were spent in Canal Road, Bow, in the East End, but later in his childhood the family moved to Plaistow, West Ham, Essex (now in Greater London), where he attended Plaistow County Grammar School. His father was away for long periods with the Merchant Navy and the young Stamp was mostly brought up by his mother, grandmother, and aunts. He grew up idolising actor Gary Cooper after his mother took him to see &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939) when he was three years old. He was also inspired by the 1950s method-trained actor James Dean.

Growing up in London during World War II, Stamp endured the Blitz as a child (he would later aid &quot;Valkyrie&quot; director Bryan Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from the Allied bombings). After leaving school, Stamp worked in a variety of advertising agencies in London, working his way up to earning a reasonable salary. In the mid‑1950s, he also worked as an assistant to professional golfer Reg Knight at Wanstead Golf Club in east London. He describes this period of his life positively in his autobiography &quot;Stamp Album&quot;.

==Career==

=== Early career and rise to fame ===
Stamp won a scholarship to train at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, then performed in various provincial repertory theatres, most notably in a national tour of Willis Hall&#x27;s play &quot;The Long the Short and the Tall&quot; alongside another young cockney actor Michael Caine. Caine moved in with Stamp, and they began spending time with Peter O&#x27;Toole in the London party scene. Stamp made his film debut in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s film adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1962). His portrayal of the title character brought him not only an Academy Award nomination but also international attention. He then appeared opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;Term of Trial&quot; (1962).
Stamp collaborated with some of the most revered filmmakers. He starred in &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965), William Wyler&#x27;s adaptation of John Fowles&#x27; novel of the same name, opposite Samantha Eggar, and in &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966), for director Joseph Losey and producer Joe Janni. Stamp reunited with producer Janni for two more projects: John Schlesinger&#x27;s adaptation of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967) starring Julie Christie, and Ken Loach&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967).

Stamp was approached to play the role of James Bond when Sean Connery retired from the role, but did not receive a second call from producer Harry Saltzman because, in Stamp&#x27;s opinion, &quot;my ideas about [how the role should be portrayed] put the frighteners on Harry. I didn&#x27;t get a second call from him.&quot;

Stamp then travelled to Italy to star in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Toby Dammit&quot;, a 50-minute portion of the Edgar Allan Poe film adaptation &quot;Histoires extraordinaires&quot; (1968, aka &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot;). Stamp lived in Italy for several years, during which time his film work included Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Teorema&quot; (1968) opposite Silvana Mangano, and &quot;A Season in Hell&quot; (1971). Stamp was considered for the title role of &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), but turned it down in favour of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966).
Stamp&#x27;s subsequent film credits included &quot;The Mind of Mr. Soames&quot; (1970) where he played an infantile patient, &quot;A Season in Hell&quot; (1971), &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Hit&quot; (1984), which won a Mystfest Award for Best Actor, shared with John Hurt and Tim Roth. Also in 1984, he had the opportunity to play the Devil in a cameo in &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Link&quot; (1986), &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986), &quot;The Sicilian&quot; (1987), and a cameo as Sir Larry Wildman in &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987). He played the ranch owner, John Tunstall, in &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988). His film &quot;Beltenebros&quot; (1992) (aka &quot;Prince of Shadows&quot;), was awarded the Silver Bear at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. Stamp began his fourth decade as an actor wearing some of the choicest of Tim Chappel&#x27;s Academy Award-winning costumes for the comedy &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994) which co-starred Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving.

In 1999, Stamp played a lead role in &quot;The Limey&quot; to widespread critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival. For his performance, Stamp received nominations for Best Male Lead at the 2000 Independent Spirit Awards and for Best British Actor at the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle (ALFS) Awards. Also in 1999, Stamp appeared in the blockbuster &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; as Chancellor Finis Valorum (an experience he later described as &#x27;boring&#x27;), followed by &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999) and &quot;Red Planet&quot; (2000). He also appeared in Damian Pettigrew&#x27;s award-winning documentary, &quot;&quot; (2002), offering ideas into the mind and working methods of Italian director Federico Fellini with whom Stamp had worked in the 1960s.

===&quot;Superman&quot; roles===

Stamp portrayed the Kryptonian supervillain General Zod in Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), in which he appeared in a scene with Marlon Brando. The film and its first sequel were originally conceived as one film, with Zod and his evil conspirators returning later in the film to challenge Superman, but the screenplay was so long that the producers elected to split it into two parts. Both parts began shooting simultaneously, but production on the sequel was halted partway through due to budget and time constraints. Stamp reappeared as General Zod in the second part, &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), as the film&#x27;s primary villain. Donner was replaced as director on the sequel with Richard Lester, who completed the film using portions of Donner&#x27;s original footage combined with newly filmed scenes. &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked Stamp&#x27;s portrayal of General Zod #32 on their &quot;Top 50 Greatest Villains of All Time&quot; list in 2007.

On the occasion of Superman&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 1988, Stamp introduced the BBC Radio special &quot;Superman On Trial&quot;, which was produced by Dirk Maggs and starred Stuart Milligan as Superman. In 2003, Stamp returned to the &quot;Superman&quot; franchise in a new role, by portraying the voice of Clark Kent&#x27;s biological father Jor-El in the WB/CW television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. He also provided the scream of Zod (being exorcised from the body of Lex Luthor) in the sixth-season premiere episode &quot;Zod&quot;. In 2006, he appeared as Zod once again in &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot; (a retooled version of the 1980 film which features footage shot by Donner, the film&#x27;s original director).

===Subsequent years===
In recent years, Stamp has appeared in the films &quot;Ma femme est une actrice&quot; (&quot;My Wife Is An Actress&quot;, 2001), &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003), Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; (2003), and the superhero fantasy &quot;Elektra&quot; (2005). He filmed a cameo appearance for &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, but his performance was cut from the movie. In 2008, he appeared in the film remake of the spy comedy &quot;Get Smart&quot;; another comedy about the man who says yes to everything &quot;Yes Man&quot;, opposite Jim Carrey; with Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in &quot;Wanted&quot;; and with Tom Cruise in &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg&#x27;s failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Entering in the 2010s, Stamp appeared in &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011), an American romantic science fiction thriller film loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story, &quot;Adjustment Team&quot;, opposite Matt Damon. In 2012, Stamp appeared in the Peter Serafinowicz-directed music video for the Hot Chip song &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot;, portrayed a grumpy husband called Arthur in Paul Andrew Williams&#x27; &quot;Song for Marion&quot; (2012), opposite Gemma Arterton and a heist comedy &quot;The Art of the Steal&quot; (2013), with Kurt Russell, Matt Dillon and Jay Baruchel.

In 2014, Stamp appeared in Tim Burton&#x27;s drama film &quot;Big Eyes&quot;, with Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. In 2016, Stamp appeared in another Tim Burton film, &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;, where he played Abe, the grandfather of the film&#x27;s protagonist Jake.

Stamp&#x27;s next project was &quot;Crooked House&quot; (2017), directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner and starring Christina Hendricks, Gillian Anderson and Glenn Close. He also appears in George Mendeluk&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Harvest&quot;, opposite Max Irons, Samantha Barks, Barry Pepper, and Aneurin Barnard.

=== Books, music videos and voice acting ===
In addition to his acting career, Stamp is an accomplished writer and author. He has published three volumes of his memoirs including &quot;Stamp Album&quot; (written in tribute to his late mother), a novel entitled &quot;The Night&quot;, and a cookbook co-written with Elizabeth Buxton to provide alternative recipes for those who are wheat- and lactose-intolerant. Stamp&#x27;s recent projects include the video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, where he voiced the villainous cult leader Mankar Camoran; and the films &quot;Zombie Island&quot; and &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. Stamp voiced the Prophet of Truth in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, replacing Michael Wincott. In 2005, Stamp also narrated the BBC Four documentary &quot;Jazz Britannia&quot;, which chronicles the evolution of British jazz music.

Stamp read the book &quot;Perfect Brilliant Stillness&quot; by David Carse for SilkSoundBooks. In his introductory reading, Stamp describes his love for this book by saying, &quot;Greater love hath no man&quot;. Stamp appeared in the music video for &quot;At the Bottom of Everything&quot; by Bright Eyes. Stamp appeared as the featured &#x27;castaway&#x27; on BBC Radio&#x27;s long-running &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in June 1987, and made a second appearance in March 2006 with a different selection of music.

In 2002 Stamp provided the narration for &quot;History of Football: The Beautiful Game&quot;, a series on all aspects of the world&#x27;s most popular sport. Stamp attended every England game (including the final) at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and in July 2016 he narrated &quot;1966 – A Nation Remembers&quot; shown on ITV, marking the 50th anniversary of England&#x27;s World Cup victory.

On 7 July 2007, Stamp gave a speech on climate change at the British leg of Live Earth in Wembley Stadium before introducing Madonna. His memoir, &quot;The Ocean Fell into the Drop&quot;, was published by Repeater Books in 2017. Stamp also narrated the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Only Fools and Horses&quot; in 2017.

==Personal life==

In the 1960s, Stamp shared a house with actor Michael Caine in Wimpole Street, London, before and during their rise to fame. In his autobiography, &quot;What&#x27;s it All About&quot;, Caine stated &quot;I still wake up sweating in the night as I see Terence agreeing to accept my advice to take the role in &quot;Alfie&quot;&quot;.

Stamp received extensive media coverage of his romances in the 1960s with film star Julie Christie and supermodel Jean Shrimpton. He and Shrimpton were one of the most-photographed couples of Mod London. After Shrimpton ended her relationship with Stamp, he moved to India and spent time at the ashram of Krishnamurti.

Stamp&#x27;s brother Chris became a rock music impresario credited with helping to bring The Who to prominence during the 1960s and co-founding Track Records.

In 1984, the band the Smiths released their third single, &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; The single cover was a photograph taken on the set of the film &quot;The Collector&quot; (but not depicted in the film). Originally, Stamp refused permission for the still to be used, and some pressings featured lead singer Morrissey in a re-enacted scene. In the re-enactment Morrissey is holding a glass of milk, as opposed to the chloroform pad of the original. Eventually, Stamp changed his mind, and the original cover was reinstated.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002, Stamp married for the first time at the age of 64. His 29-year-old bride was Elizabeth O&#x27;Rourke, whom Stamp first met in the mid-1990s at a chemist&#x27;s shop in Bondi, New South Wales. Of Australian and Indian-Singaporean parentage, O&#x27;Rourke was brought up in Singapore before moving to Australia in her early twenties to study pharmacology. The couple divorced on the grounds of his &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot; in April 2008.

<text>4 Non Blondes was an American rock band from San Francisco, active from 1989 to 1994. Their only album, &quot;Bigger, Better, Faster, More!&quot;, spent 59 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 1.5 million copies between 1992 and 1994. They hit the charts in 1993 with the release of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot;

Originally, the band was all-female, with vocalist Linda Perry, bassist Christa Hillhouse, guitarist Shaunna Hall, and drummer Wanda Day. However, before their album was released, Dawn Richardson replaced Day on drums, and Roger Rocha replaced Hall on guitar.

Perry left the band in 1994, and the remaining members disbanded shortly afterward.

==Career==
===Formation===
Bassist Christa Hillhouse and guitarist Shaunna Hall had been roommates and met drummer Wanda Day when they joined a band she was playing in. When the three left that band, they started playing as a trio, but after seeing Perry sing at a solo performance, Hillhouse and Hall asked her to join as vocalist.

According to Perry, she and Hall were at Nightbreak, a San Francisco club, and when it was mentioned the trio was looking for a vocalist, Perry announced she was a singer, to which Hall replied, &quot;I know&quot;. Their first rehearsal was supposed to be at 6:10 pm on October 17, 1989, but shortly after 5:00 pm the Loma Prieta earthquake hit the San Francisco area.

The name of the band came from an experience the group had in the Bay Area with a blonde family. According to Christa Hillhouse, &quot;Right next to us, there&#x27;s a trash receptacle with a piece of pizza on top and the kid wanted to pick it up. The mom said, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s probably dirty, what with the pigeons and people.&#x27; And she stared right at us. We were Non Blondes.&quot; They said the experience became a symbol that they did not fit the California stereotype.

===Bigger, Better, Faster, More!===
They got their start in the San Francisco bar scene, especially lesbian bars, gaining a significant lesbian following. In July 1991, the band was signed to Interscope following a performance at the Gavin Convention, where they opened for Primus on Valentine&#x27;s Day of the same year. As they began pre-production for their debut album, Day was fired and replaced by Dawn Richardson. In 1992, while recording &quot;Bigger, Better, Faster, More!&quot; the album&#x27;s producer, David Tickle, felt that Hall&#x27;s guitar playing was &quot;not happening&quot; so she was let go from the band as well. Guitarist Louis Metoyer finished the record.

The album and its song &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single in 1993. It was successful in the United States and in several European countries, peaking at number one in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Roger Rocha joined after completion of the album and stayed with the band until 1994.

Openly lesbian lead singer Perry often performed with a prominent &quot;dyke&quot; sticker affixed to her guitar, including at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards in 1993 and on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

4 Non Blondes contributed the song &quot;Mary&#x27;s House&quot; to the film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; in 1993. They also covered Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; on the soundtrack for &quot;Airheads&quot;. They contributed &quot;Bless the Beasts and Children&quot; to a 1994 The Carpenters tribute album &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;, and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; to the 1995 &quot;Encomium&quot; tribute album to Led Zeppelin.

===Split and aftermath===
The group disbanded in late 1994 during the recording of their second album. Perry has said that she had been unhappy with &quot;Bigger, Better, Faster, More!&quot; She has also explained that her sexuality had a part to play in her tensions with the group. Perry was an out lesbian, but band members Hillhouse and Richardson were less comfortable being as open about their sexuality in the early 1990s.

Perry went solo in 1995. She has released solo work, and produced and written songs on albums by Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Courtney Love, and Kelly Osbourne.

Hall has recorded, produced, composed for, and performed with various artists, including vocalist Storm Large (1999–2001), guitarist Eric McFadden (1995–2001), and funk pioneer George Clinton &amp; Parliament Funkadelic and released &quot;Electrofunkadelica: e3+FUNKnth = music for the body, mind &amp; soul&quot;, a self-produced project in 2006 on Make Music, Not War! Records.

After leaving the Non Blondes in 1991, Day continued drumming with Malibu Barbi, and then Bad Dog Play Dead. In late 1992, an accident crushed her legs and broke her back, which made drumming very painful. She moved out of San Francisco in 1995, spent some time in Arizona and eventually went back to Salt Lake City. Day died on July 10, 1997, and is buried in Tropic, Utah.

Hillhouse maintains the official website for 4 Non Blondes.

Perry and Hillhouse reunited in 1999 in support of Perry&#x27;s solo tour.

===Reunion===
On May 11, 2014, the group reunited to perform a concert at a fundraiser entitled &quot;An Evening For Women: Celebrating Arts, Music and Equality&quot; which was held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Perry produces the annual event for the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center to raise money for the center. According to Perry, &quot;the majority of the money goes to the youth center program, which is basically kids that get thrown out on the street by their own parents for being gay.&quot; The six songs on the track list were &quot;Train&quot;, &quot;Spaceman&quot;, &quot;The Ladder&quot;, &quot;Mighty Lady&quot;, &quot;Superfly&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot;, and the fundraiser was organized by the Los Angeles LGBT Center.

Dolly Parton and Linda Perry did a cover of the band&#x27;s song &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot; in 2023.

In January 2025, a reunion at BottleRock Napa Valley was announced.

<text>Maria Coventry, Countess of Coventry (&quot;née&quot; Gunning; 15 August 1732 – 30 September 1760) was an Irish beauty and London society hostess during the reign of King George II. She died at a young age due to lead poisoning from toxins in her beauty regimen.

== Biography ==

Maria was born in Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire, England and was the eldest child of John Gunning of Castle Coote in County Roscommon, Ireland, and his wife Hon. Bridget Bourke, daughter of Theobald Bourke, 6th Viscount Mayo (1681–1741). Maria&#x27;s younger siblings were Elizabeth, Catherine (married Robert Travis, died 1773), Sophia, Lizzie and John (a general in the army).

In late 1740 or early 1741, the Gunning family returned to John Gunning&#x27;s ancestral home in Ireland, where they divided their time between their home in Roscommon and a rented house in Dublin. According to some sources, when Maria and her sister Elizabeth came of age, their mother urged them to take up acting in order to earn a living, owing to the family&#x27;s relative poverty. The sources further state that the Gunning sisters worked for some time in the Dublin theatres, befriending actors like Peg Woffington, even though acting was not considered a respectable profession, as many actresses doubled as courtesans to wealthy benefactors. However, other sources deny this and point out that Margaret Woffington did not arrive in Dublin until May 1751, by which time Maria and her sister Elizabeth were in England.
In October 1748, a ball was held at Dublin Castle by the Viscountess Petersham. The two sisters did not have suitable attire to attend such an occasion until Thomas Sheridan, the manager of one of the local theatres, supplied them with two costumes from the green room—those of Lady Macbeth and Juliet. Wearing the costumes, they were presented to the Earl of Harrington, the then-Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Harrington must have been pleased by the meeting as, by 1750, Bridget Gunning had persuaded him to grant her a pension, which she then used to transport herself, Maria and Elizabeth back to their original home in Huntingdon, England. With their attendance at local balls and parties, the beauty of the two girls was much remarked upon. They became well-known celebrities, their fame reaching all the way to London. On 2 December 1750, they were presented at the court of St James, at which time they were sufficiently famous that the presentation was noted in the London newspapers. Maria, who was notoriously tactless, was reported to have made a notable gaffe by telling the elderly George II that the spectacle she would most like to see was a royal funeral. Fortunately, the king was highly amused.

Within a year, Elizabeth had married the Duke of Hamilton. In March 1752, Maria married the 6th Earl of Coventry and became the Countess of Coventry. Her husband became involved with the then-famous courtesan Kitty Fisher, which caused his wife much distress.

She was rumoured to have been involved romantically with the 3rd Duke of Grafton, but this was never confirmed beyond doubt.

== Death ==
Maria&#x27;s early death (at the age of 27) on 30 September 1760 was caused by lead poisoning from the makeup she used, which was very stylish at the time. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, it was fashionable for women to whiten their skin with a lead-based make up, Venetian ceruse, and paint on red rouged cheeks. The noxious effects of lead caused skin eruptions, which then encouraged women to apply more ceruse to cover the blemishes, eventually causing poisoning.

Originally known simply as a beautiful but vain woman, Maria eventually became known in society circles as a &quot;victim of cosmetics&quot;.

<doc id="215633" wikidata="Q262212" url="?curid=215633" title="Piero the Unfortunate">
<text>Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (15 February 1472 – 28 December 1503), called Piero the Fatuous or Piero the Unfortunate, was the lord of Florence from 1492 until his exile in 1494.

==Early life==
Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici was the eldest son of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent) and Clarice Orsini. He was raised alongside his younger brother Giovanni, who would go on to become Pope Leo X, and his cousin Giulio, who would later become Pope Clement VII.

Piero was educated to succeed his father as head of the Medici family and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Florentine state, under figures such as Angelo Poliziano or Marsilio Ficino. However, his feeble, arrogant, and undisciplined character was to prove unsuited to such a role. Poliziano later died of poisoning, very possibly by Piero, on 24 September 1494. Piero was also constantly at odds with his cousins, Lorenzo and Giovanni, the two sons of Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, who were both older and richer than Piero.

== Marriage and children ==
In 1486, Piero&#x27;s uncle Bernardo Rucellai negotiated for him to marry the Tuscan noblewoman Alfonsina Orsini and stood in for him in a marriage by proxy. Piero and Alfonsina met in 1488. She was a daughter of Roberto Orsini, Count of Tagliacozzo, and Caterina Sanseverino. They had three children: Clarice (September 1489–1528), who later married Filippo Strozzi the Younger; * Lorenzo (September 1492–1519), later Duke of Urbino; and Luisa, born February 1494. From baptismal records it appears that in February 1492 he also had another daughter, Maria, who was illegitimate.

== Rule of Florence ==

Piero took over as leader of Florence in 1492, upon Lorenzo&#x27;s death. After a brief period of relative calm, the fragile peaceful equilibrium between the Italian states, laboriously constructed by Piero&#x27;s father, collapsed in 1494 with the decision of King Charles VIII of France to cross the Alps with an army in order to assert hereditary claims to the Kingdom of Naples. Charles had been lured to Italy by Ludovico Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), ex-regent of Milan, as a way to eject Ludovico&#x27;s nephew Gian Galeazzo Sforza and replace him as duke.

After settling matters in Milan, Charles moved towards Naples. He needed to pass through Tuscany, as well as leave troops there to secure his lines of communication with Milan. As Charles&#x27;s army approached Tuscany, he sent envoys to Florence to ask Piero to support his claim to Naples and allow his army to pass through Tuscany. Piero waited five days before responding that Florence would remain neutral. This was unacceptable to Charles, who intended to invade Tuscany, starting with the fortress of Fivizzano, which he sacked and brutally massacred.

Piero attempted to mount a resistance, but received little support from members of the Florentine elite who had fallen under the influence of the fanatical Dominican priest Girolamo Savonarola. Even his cousins, Lorenzo and Giovanni, allied themselves with Charles, sending him messages to pledge their support and funds.

By the end of October, Piero had not succeeded in gaining any support for Florence, and, without consulting the governing Signoria, decided to visit Charles at his camp and try to win his friendship. During their meeting, Piero acceded to all of Charles&#x27;s demands, including surrendering the fortresses of Sarzana, Pietrasanta, Sarzanello, and Librafratta, as well as the towns of Pisa and Livorno.

When Piero returned to Florence to report back to the Signoria, he was greeted with public outrage, and he and his family fled the city for Venice. The family &quot;palazzo&quot; was looted, and the substance as well as the form of the Republic of Florence was re-established with the Medici formally exiled. A member of the Medici family was not to rule Florence again until 1512, when the city was forced to surrender by Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, who in 1513 was elected Pope Leo X, solidifying the family&#x27;s power.

== Exile ==
Piero and his family fled at first to Venice with the aid of the French diplomat Philippe de Commines, a retainer of Charles VIII. They supported themselves by selling Medici jewels that had been collected by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Piero also tried to reinstate himself in Florence multiple times, once appearing at the Porta Romana in Florence with a band of men, who left for Siena after it appeared that Florentines would not welcome the Medici back as leaders.

In 1503, as the French and Spanish continued their struggle in Italy over the Kingdom of Naples, Piero was drowned in the Garigliano River while attempting to flee the aftermath of the Battle of Garigliano, which the French (with whom he was allied) had lost. He was buried in the Abbey of Monte Cassino; his tomb was designed by Antonio and Battista da Sangallo.

<text>Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, 1st Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon ( December 1733 – 20 December 1790), earlier Elizabeth Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton, Gunning, was a celebrated Anglo-Irish beauty, lady-in-waiting to Queen Charlotte, and society hostess.

== Early life ==
Born in Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire, Elizabeth Gunning was one of the daughters of John Gunning of Castle Coote, County Roscommon, and his wife, Bridget Bourke, a daughter of Theobald Bourke, 6th Viscount Mayo (1681–1741). Elizabeth&#x27;s elder sister was Maria Gunning, later Countess of Coventry.

In late 1740 or early 1741, the Gunning family returned from England to John Gunning&#x27;s ancestral home in Ireland, where they divided their time between their country house in Roscommon and a rented town house in Dublin. According to some sources, when Maria and her sister Elizabeth came of age, their mother urged them to take up acting, in order to earn a living, owing to the family&#x27;s relative poverty, even though acting was not considered a respectable profession, as many actresses of that time doubled as courtesans; and that the Gunning sisters worked for some time in the Dublin theatres, befriending actors who included Margaret Woffington. However, Woffington did not arrive in Dublin until May 1751, by which time Maria and her sister Elizabeth were in England.

In October 1748, a ball was held at Dublin Castle by Viscountess Petersham. The two sisters did not have any dresses for the gathering until Thomas Sheridan, manager of one of the local theatres, supplied them with two costumes from the green room, those of Lady Macbeth and Juliet. Wearing the costumes, they were presented to the Earl of Harrington, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Harrington must have been pleased by the meeting as, by 1750, Bridget Gunning had persuaded him to grant her a pension, which she then used to transport herself, Maria, and Elizabeth, back to their original home in Huntingdon, England. With their attendance at local balls and parties, the beauty of the two girls was much remarked upon. They became well-known celebrities, their fame reaching all the way to London, with themselves following soon afterwards. On 2 December 1750, they were presented at the Court of St James&#x27;s. By this time, they were sufficiently famous that the presentation was noted in the London newspapers.

Elizabeth was immortalized in portraits by, among others, artists Joshua Reynolds and Gavin Hamilton.

==Marriages==


In January or February 1752, Elizabeth met the young James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton (1724–1758). According to Horace Walpole, it was on 14 February (Valentine&#x27;s Day) at a party at Bedford House, and the duke declared his wish to marry Elizabeth that night and called for a local clergyman to perform the ceremony. However, without a licence, calling of banns, or a ring, the clergyman refused. They were eventually married that night in May Fair Chapel, which did not require a licence, with a ring from a bed-curtain, whereupon Elizabeth became the Duchess of Hamilton.

Walpole said of the couple: &quot;Duke Hamilton is the abstract of Scotch pride: he and the Duchess at their own house walk in to dinner before their company, sit together at the upper end of their own table, eat off the same plate, and drink to nobody beneath the rank of Earl—would not one wonder how they could get any body either above or below that rank to dine with them at all?&quot;.

Soon after the duke died on 17 January 1758, aged only 33, Elizabeth became engaged to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, but the engagement was cancelled that year for reasons unknown. On 3 February the following year she married John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, son and heir of the Duke of Argyll.

From 1761 to 1784, she was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Charlotte. Her husband succeeded to his father&#x27;s title of Duke of Argyll in 1770, and Elizabeth became known as the Duchess of Argyll. On 20 May 1776, King George III, a long time admirer of hers, created her Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon in her own right.

===Children===
Elizabeth had three children from her first marriage to the Duke of Hamilton:
*Lady Elizabeth Hamilton (26 January 1753 – 14 March 1797), married Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby
*James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton (18 February 1755 – 7 July 1769)
*Douglas Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton (24 July 1756 – 2 August 1799)

Elizabeth had five children from her second marriage, with the Duke of Argyll:
*Lady Augusta Campbell
*George John Campbell, Earl of Campbell (1763–1764)
*George Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll (1768–1839)
*Lady Charlotte Campbell (1775–1861), married firstly Colonel John Campbell and secondly Rev. Edward John Bury
*John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll (1777–1847)

==Later life==
Elizabeth died on 20 December 1790 at her home of Argyll House in London and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church in Kilmun, Argyllshire.

==Honours==
* Lady of the Bedchamber, &quot;1761–1784&quot;

As Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon, Elizabeth received a grant of arms, blazoned: &quot;Gules, on a fess ermine, between three doves argent ducally crowned or, as many crosses pattée, of the first&quot;, which incorporate elements of the arms of her own Gunning family.
