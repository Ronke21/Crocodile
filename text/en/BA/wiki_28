<text>A supersonic transport (SST) or a supersonic airliner is a civilian supersonic aircraft designed to transport passengers at speeds greater than the speed of sound in terms of air speed. To date, the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144. The last passenger flight of the Tu-144 was in June 1978 and it was last flown in 1999 by NASA. Concorde&#x27;s last commercial flight was in October 2003, with a November 26, 2003 ferry flight being its last flight. 

Following the termination of flying by Concorde, there have been no SSTs in commercial service. However, several companies have proposed supersonic business jet designs. Small SSTs have less environmental impact and design capability improves with continuing research which is aimed at producing an acceptable aircraft.

Supersonic airliners have been the objects of numerous ongoing design studies such as those of Boom Technology. Drawbacks and design challenges are excessive noise generation (at takeoff and due to sonic booms during flight), high development costs, expensive construction materials, high fuel consumption, extremely high emissions, and an increased cost per seat over subsonic airliners. However, despite these challenges, Concorde was claimed to have operated profitably.

== History ==

=== Planning ===

Throughout the 1950s an SST looked possible from a technical standpoint, but it was not clear if it could be made economically viable. Because of differences in lift generation, aircraft operating at supersonic speeds have approximately one-half the lift-to-drag ratio of subsonic aircraft. This implies that for any given required amount of lift, the aircraft will have to supply about twice the thrust, leading to considerably greater fuel use. This effect is pronounced at speeds close to the speed of sound, as the aircraft is using twice the thrust to travel at about the same speed. The &quot;relative&quot; effect is reduced as the aircraft accelerates to higher speeds. Offsetting this increase in fuel use was the potential to greatly increase sortie rates of the aircraft, at least on medium and long-range flights where the aircraft spends a considerable amount of time in cruise. SST designs flying at least three times as fast as existing subsonic transports were possible, and would thus be able to replace as many as three planes in service, and thereby lower costs in terms of manpower and maintenance.

Serious work on SST designs started in the mid-1950s, when the first generation of supersonic fighter aircraft were entering service. In Britain and France, government-subsidized SST programs quickly settled on the delta wing in most studies, including the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle and Bristol Type 223, although Armstrong-Whitworth proposed a more radical design, the Mach 1.2 M-Wing. Avro Canada proposed several designs to TWA that included Mach 1.6 double-ogee wing and Mach 1.2 delta-wing with separate tail and four under-wing engine configurations. Avro&#x27;s team moved to the UK where its design formed the basis of Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s designs. By the early 1960s, the designs had progressed to the point where the go-ahead for production was given, but costs were so high that the Bristol Aeroplane Company and Sud Aviation eventually merged their efforts in 1962 to produce Concorde.

In the early 1960s, various executives of US aerospace companies were telling the US public and Congress that there were no technical reasons an SST could not be produced. In April 1960, Burt C Monesmith, a vice president with Lockheed, stated to various magazines that an SST constructed of steel weighing could be developed for $160 million and in production lots of 200 or more sold for around $9 million. But it was the Anglo-French development of the Concorde that set off panic in the US industry, where it was thought that Concorde would soon replace all other long range designs, especially after Pan Am took out purchase options on the Concorde. Congress was soon funding an SST design effort, selecting the existing Lockheed L-2000 and Boeing 2707 designs, to produce an even more advanced, larger, faster and longer ranged design. The Boeing 2707 design was eventually selected for continued work, with design goals of ferrying around 300 passengers and having a cruising speed near to Mach 3. The Soviet Union set out to produce its own design, the Tu-144, which the western press nicknamed the &quot;Concordski&quot;.

=== Environmental concerns ===

The SST was seen as particularly offensive due to its sonic boom and the potential for its engine exhaust to damage the ozone layer. Both problems impacted the thinking of lawmakers, and eventually Congress dropped funding for the US SST program in and all overland commercial supersonic flight was banned over the US. Presidential advisor Russell Train warned that a fleet of 500 SSTs flying at for a period of years could raise stratospheric water content by as much as 50% to 100%. According to Train, this could lead to greater ground-level heat and hamper the formation of ozone.

Later, an additional threat to the ozone was hypothesized as a result of the exhaust&#x27;s nitrogen oxides, a threat that was, in 1974, seemingly validated by an MIT team commissioned by the United States Department of Transportation. However, while many purely theoretical models were indicating the potential for large ozone losses from SST nitrogen oxides (NOx), other scientists in the paper &quot;Nitrogen Oxides, Nuclear Weapon Testing, Concorde and Stratospheric Ozone&quot; turned to historical ozone monitoring and atmospheric nuclear testing to serve as a guide and means of comparison, observing that no detectable ozone loss was evident from approximately 213 megatons of explosive energy being released in 1962, so therefore the equivalent amount of NOx from &quot;1047&quot; Concordes flying &quot;10 hours a day&quot;, would likewise, not be unprecedented. In 1981 models and observations were still irreconcilable. More recent computer models in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and others, suggest that the drop in ozone would be at most, &quot;no more&quot; than 1 to 2% if a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft [were] operated. Fahey expressed that this would not be a fatal obstacle for an advanced SST development – while &quot;a big caution flag...[it] should not be a showstopper for advanced SST development&quot; because &quot;removing the sulfur in the fuel of the [Concorde]&quot; would essentially eliminate the hypothesized 1%–2% ozone-destruction-reaction-pathway.

=== Concorde ===

Despite the model-observation discrepancy surrounding the ozone concern, in the mid-1970s, six years after its first supersonic test flight, Concorde was now ready for service. The US political outcry was so high that New York banned the plane. This threatened the aircraft&#x27;s economic prospects — it had been built with the London–New York route in mind. The plane was allowed into Washington, D.C. (at Dulles in Virginia), and the service was so popular that New Yorkers were soon complaining because they did not have it. It was not long before Concorde was flying into JFK.

Along with shifting political considerations, the flying public continued to show interest in high-speed ocean crossings. This started additional design studies in the US, under the name &quot;AST&quot; (Advanced Supersonic Transport). Lockheed&#x27;s SCV was a new design for this category, while Boeing continued studies with the 2707 as a baseline.

By this time, the economics of past SST concepts were no longer reasonable. When first designed, the SSTs were envisioned to compete with long-range aircraft seating 80 to 100 passengers such as the Boeing 707, but with newer aircraft such as the Boeing 747 carrying four times that, the speed and fuel advantages of the SST concept were taken away by sheer size.

Another problem was that the wide range of speeds over which an SST operates makes it difficult to improve engines. While subsonic engines had made great strides in increased efficiency through the 1960s with the introduction of the turbofan engine with ever-increasing bypass ratios, the fan concept is difficult to use at supersonic speeds where the &quot;proper&quot; bypass is about 0.45, as opposed to 2.0 or higher for subsonic designs. For both of these reasons the SST designs were doomed by higher operational costs, and the AST programs vanished by the early 1980s.

=== Profitability ===

Concorde only sold to British Airways and Air France, with subsidized purchases that were to return 80% of the profits to the government. In practice for almost all of the length of the arrangement, there was no profit to be shared. After Concorde was privatized, cost reduction measures (notably the closing of the metallurgical wing testing site which had done enough temperature cycles to validate the aircraft through to 2010) and ticket price raises led to substantial profits.

Since Concorde stopped flying, it has been revealed that over the life of Concorde, the plane did prove profitable, at least to British Airways. Concorde operating costs over nearly 28 years of operation were approximately £1 billion, with revenues of £1.75 billion.

=== Final flights ===

On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590 crashed shortly after take-off with all 109 occupants and four on ground killed; the only fatal incident involving Concorde. Commercial service was suspended until November 2001, and Concorde aircraft were retired in 2003 after 27 years of commercial operations.

The last regular passenger flights landed at London Heathrow on October 24, 2003, from New York, a second flight from Edinburgh, and a third which had taken off from Heathrow on a loop flight over the Bay of Biscay.

By the end of the 20th century, projects like the Tupolev Tu-244, Tupolev Tu-344, SAI Quiet Supersonic Transport, Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21, High Speed Civil Transport, etc. had not been realized.

== Design ==

=== Aerodynamics ===

For all vehicles traveling through air, the force of drag is proportional to the coefficient of drag (&quot;Cd&quot;), to the square of the airspeed and to the air density. Since drag rises rapidly with speed, a key priority of supersonic aircraft design is to minimize this force by lowering the coefficient of drag. This gives rise to the highly streamlined shapes of SSTs. To some extent, supersonic aircraft also manage drag by flying at higher altitudes than subsonic aircraft, where the air density is lower.

As speeds approach the speed of sound, the additional phenomenon of wave drag appears. This is a powerful form of drag that begins at transonic speeds (around Mach 0.88). Around Mach 1, the peak coefficient of drag is four times that of subsonic drag. Above the transonic range, the coefficient drops drastically again, although remains 20% higher by Mach 2.5 than at subsonic speeds. Supersonic aircraft must have considerably more power than subsonic aircraft require to overcome this wave drag, and although cruising performance above transonic speed is more efficient, it is still less efficient than flying subsonically.

Another issue in supersonic flight is the lift to drag ratio (L/D ratio) of the wings. At supersonic speeds, airfoils generate lift in an entirely different manner than at subsonic speeds, and are invariably less efficient. For this reason, considerable research has been put into designing wing planforms for sustained supersonic cruise. At about Mach 2, a typical wing design will cut its L/D ratio in half (e.g., Concorde managed a ratio of 7.14, whereas the subsonic Boeing 747 has an L/D ratio of 17). Because an aircraft&#x27;s design must provide enough lift to overcome its own weight, a reduction of its L/D ratio at supersonic speeds requires additional thrust to maintain its airspeed and altitude.

=== Engines ===

Jet engine design shifts significantly between supersonic and subsonic aircraft. Jet engines, as a class, can supply increased fuel efficiency at supersonic speeds, even though their specific fuel consumption is greater at higher speeds. Because their speed over the ground is greater, this decrease in efficiency is less than proportional to speed until well above Mach 2, and the consumption per unit distance is lower.

When Concorde was being designed by Aérospatiale–BAC, high bypass jet engines (&quot;turbofan&quot; engines) had not yet been deployed on subsonic aircraft. Had Concorde entered service against earlier designs like the Boeing 707 or de Havilland Comet, it would have been much more competitive, though the 707 and DC-8 still carried more passengers. When these high bypass jet engines reached commercial service in the 1960s, subsonic jet engines immediately became much more efficient, closer to the efficiency of turbojets at supersonic speeds. One major advantage of the SST disappeared.

Turbofan engines improve efficiency by increasing the amount of cold low-pressure air they accelerate, using some of the energy normally used to accelerate hot air in the classic non-bypass turbojet. The ultimate expression of this design is the turboprop, where almost all of the jet thrust is used to power a very large fan – the propeller. The efficiency curve of the fan design means that the amount of bypass that maximizes overall engine efficiency is a function of forward speed, which decreases from propellers, to fans, to no bypass at all as speed increases. Additionally, the large frontal area taken up by the low-pressure fan at the front of the engine increases drag, especially at supersonic speeds, and means the bypass ratios are much more limited than on subsonic aircraft.

For example, the early Tu-144S was fitted with a low bypass turbofan engine which was much less efficient than Concorde&#x27;s turbojets in supersonic flight. The later TU-144D featured turbojet engines with comparable efficiency. These limitations meant that SST designs were not able to take advantage of the dramatic improvements in fuel economy that high bypass engines brought to the subsonic market, but they were already more efficient than their subsonic turbofan counterparts.

=== Structure ===

Supersonic vehicle speeds demand narrower wing and fuselage designs, and are subject to greater stresses and temperatures. This leads to aeroelasticity problems, which require heavier structures to minimize unwanted flexing. SSTs also require a much stronger (and therefore heavier) structure because their fuselage must be pressurized to a greater differential than subsonic aircraft, which do not operate at the high altitudes necessary for supersonic flight. These factors together meant that the empty weight per seat of Concorde is more than three times that of a Boeing 747.

Concorde and the Tu-144 were both constructed of conventional aluminum: Concorde of Hiduminium and Tu-144 of duralumin. Modern, advanced materials were not to come out of development for a few decades. These materials, such as carbon fibre and Kevlar are much stronger for their weight (important to deal with stresses) as well as being more rigid. As per-seat weight of the structure is much higher in an SST design, structural improvements would have led to a greater proportional improvement than the same changes in a subsonic aircraft.

=== Cost ===

Higher fuel costs and lower passenger capacities due to the aerodynamic requirement for a narrow fuselage make SSTs an expensive form of commercial civil transportation compared with subsonic aircraft. For example, the Boeing 747 can carry more than three times as many passengers as Concorde while using approximately the same amount of fuel.

Nevertheless, fuel costs are not the bulk of the price for most subsonic aircraft passenger tickets. For the transatlantic business market that SST aircraft were utilized for, Concorde was actually very successful, and was able to sustain a higher ticket price. Now that commercial SST aircraft have stopped flying, it has become clearer that Concorde made substantial profit for British Airways.

=== Noise pollution ===

Extreme jet velocities used during take-off caused Concorde and Tu-144s to produce significant take-off noise. Communities near the airport were affected by high engine noise levels, which prompted some regulators to disfavor the practice. SST engines need a fairly high specific thrust (net thrust/airflow) during supersonic cruise, to minimize engine cross-sectional area and, thereby, nacelle drag. Unfortunately this implies a high jet velocity, which makes the engines noisy, particularly at low speeds/altitudes and at take-off.

Therefore, a future SST might well benefit from a variable cycle engine, where the specific thrust (and therefore jet velocity and noise) is low at take-off, but is forced high during supersonic cruise. Transition between the two modes would occur at some point during the climb and back again during the descent (to minimize jet noise upon approach). The difficulty is devising a variable cycle engine configuration that meets the requirement for a low cross-sectional area during supersonic cruise.

The sonic boom was not thought to be a serious issue due to the high altitudes at which the planes flew, but experiments in the mid-1960s such as the controversial Oklahoma City sonic boom tests and studies of the USAF&#x27;s North American XB-70 Valkyrie proved otherwise (see Sonic boom § Abatement). By 1964, whether civilian supersonic aircraft would be licensed was unclear, because of the problem.

The annoyance of a sonic boom can be avoided by waiting until the aircraft is at high altitude over water before reaching supersonic speeds; this was the technique used by Concorde. However, it precludes supersonic flight over populated areas. Supersonic aircraft have poor lift/drag ratios at subsonic speeds as compared to subsonic aircraft (unless technologies such as variable-sweep wings are employed), and hence burn more fuel, which results in their use being economically disadvantageous on such flight paths.

Concorde had an overpressure of (133 dBA SPL). Overpressures over (131 dBA SPL) often cause complaints.

If the intensity of the boom can be reduced, then this may make even very large designs of supersonic aircraft acceptable for overland flight. Research suggests that changes to the nose cone and tail can reduce the intensity of the sonic boom below that needed to cause complaints. During the original SST efforts in the 1960s, it was suggested that careful shaping of the fuselage of the aircraft could reduce the intensity of the sonic boom&#x27;s shock waves that reach the ground. One design caused the shock waves to interfere with each other, greatly reducing the sonic boom. This was difficult to test at the time, but the increasing power of computer-aided design has since made this considerably easier. In 2003, a Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration aircraft was flown which proved the soundness of the design and demonstrated the capability of reducing the boom by about half. Even lengthening the vehicle (without significantly increasing the weight) would seem to reduce the boom intensity (see Sonic boom § Abatement).

When it comes to public policy, for example, the FAA prohibits commercial airplanes from flying at supersonic speeds above sovereign land governed by the United States because of the negative impact the sonic boom brings to humans and animal populations below.

===Large speed range===

The aerodynamic design of a supersonic aircraft needs to change with its speed for optimal performance. Thus, an SST would ideally change shape during flight to maintain optimal performance at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. Such a design would introduce complexity which increases maintenance needs, operations costs, and safety concerns.

In practice all supersonic transports have used essentially the same shape for subsonic and supersonic flight, and a compromise in performance is chosen, often to the detriment of low speed flight. For example, Concorde had very high drag (a lift to drag ratio of about 4) at slow speed, but it travelled at high speed for most of the flight. Designers of Concorde spent 5000 hours optimizing the vehicle shape in wind tunnel tests to maximize the overall performance over the entire flightplan.

The Boeing 2707 featured swing wings to give higher efficiency at low speeds, but the increased space required for such a feature produced capacity problems that proved ultimately insurmountable.

North American Aviation had an unusual approach to this problem with the XB-70 Valkyrie. By lowering the outer panels of the wings at high Mach numbers, they were able to take advantage of compression lift on the underside of the aircraft. This improved the L/D ratio by about 30%.

=== Skin temperature ===

Aircraft are surrounded by an air layer the temperature of which increases with aircraft speed. As a result the skin of the aircraft gets hotter with increasing supersonic speeds (kinetic heating from the high speed boundary layer). Heat from the sun also raises the skin temperature. Heat transfers into the aircraft structure which also gets hotter. By the early 1960s many investigations in the United States, Britain and France had shown equilibrium skin temperatures varying from 130 degC at Mach 2.2 to 330 degC at Mach 3.

Subsonic aircraft are usually made of aluminium. However aluminium, while being light and strong, is not able to withstand temperatures much over 127 °C; above 127 °C the aluminium gradually loses its properties that were brought about by age hardening. For aircraft that have flown at Mach 3, materials such as stainless steel (XB-70 Valkyrie, MiG-25) or titanium (SR-71, Sukhoi T-4) have been used.

=== Range ===

The range of an aircraft depends on three efficiencies which appear in the Breguet range equation. They are the aerodynamic efficiency, which says how much wanted lift can be produced without too much unwanted drag, powerplant efficiency, which says how much fuel is converted into moving the aircraft against its drag resistance, and structural efficiency, which says how heavy the structure is compared to the fuel and passengers it can carry.

=== Commercial practicality ===

Airlines potentially value very fast aircraft, because it enables the aircraft to make more flights per day, providing a higher return on investment. Also, passengers generally prefer faster, shorter-duration trips to slower, longer-duration trips, so operating faster aircraft can give an airline a competitive advantage, even to the extent that many customers will willingly pay higher fares for the benefit of saving time and/or arriving sooner. However, Concorde&#x27;s high noise levels around airports, time zone issues, and insufficient speed meant that only a single return trip could be made per day, so the extra speed was not an advantage to the airline other than as a selling feature to its customers. The proposed American SSTs were intended to fly at Mach 3, partly for this reason. However, allowing for acceleration and deceleration time, a trans-Atlantic trip on a Mach 3 SST would be less than three times as fast as a Mach 1 trip.

Since SSTs produce sonic booms at supersonic speeds they are rarely permitted to fly supersonic over land, and must fly supersonic over sea instead. Since they are inefficient at subsonic speeds compared to subsonic aircraft, range is deteriorated and the number of routes that the aircraft can fly non-stop is reduced. This also reduces the desirability of such aircraft for most airlines.

Supersonic aircraft have higher per-passenger fuel consumption than subsonic aircraft; this makes the ticket price necessarily higher, all other factors being equal, as well as making that price more sensitive to the price of oil. (It also makes supersonic flights less friendly to the environment and sustainability, two growing concerns of the general public, including air travelers.)

Investing in research and development work to design a new SST can be considered as an effort to push the speed limit of air transport. Generally, other than an urge for new technological achievement, the major driving force for such an effort is competitive pressure from other modes of transport. Competition between different service providers within a mode of transport does not typically lead to such technological investments to increase the speed. Instead, the service providers prefer to compete in service quality and cost. An example of this phenomenon is high-speed rail. The speed limit of rail transport had been pushed so hard to enable it to effectively compete with road and air transport. But this achievement was not done for different rail operating companies to compete among themselves. This phenomenon also reduces the airline desirability of SSTs, because, for very long-distance transportation (a couple of thousand kilometers), competition between different modes of transport is rather like a single-horse race: air transport does not have a significant competitor. The only competition is between the airline companies, and they would rather pay moderately to reduce cost and increase service quality than pay much more for a speed increase. Also, for-profit companies generally prefer low risk business plans with high probabilities of appreciable profit, but an expensive leading-edge technological research and development program is a high-risk enterprise, as it is possible that the program will fail for unforeseeable technical reasons or will meet cost overruns so great as to force the company, due to financial resource limits, to abandon the effort before it yields any marketable SST technology, causing potentially all investment to be lost.

=== Environmental impact ===

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates a SST would burn 5 to 7 times as much fuel per passenger. The ICCT shows that a New York to London supersonic flight would consume more than twice as much fuel per passenger than in subsonic business-class, six times as much as for economy class, and three times as much as subsonic business for Los Angeles to Sydney. Designers can either meet existing environmental standards with advanced technology or lobby policymakers to establish new standards for SSTs.

If there were 2,000 SSTs in 2035, there would be 5,000 flights per day at 160 airports and the SST fleet would emit ~96 million metric tons of CO₂ per year (like American, Delta and Southwest combined in 2017), 1.6 to 2.4 gigatonnes of CO₂ over their 25-year lifetime: one-fifth of the international aviation carbon budget if aviation maintains its emissions share to stay under a 1.5 °C climate trajectory. Noise exposed area around airports could double compared to existing subsonic aircraft of the same size, with more than 300 operations per day at Dubai and London Heathrow, and over 100 in Los Angeles, Singapore, San Francisco, New York-JFK, Frankfurt, and Bangkok. Frequent sonic booms would be heard in Canada, Germany, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Romania, Turkey, and parts of the United States, up to 150–200 per day or one every five minutes.

== Completed projects ==

On August 21, 1961, a Douglas DC-8-43 (registration N9604Z) exceeded Mach 1 in a controlled dive during a test flight at Edwards Air Force Base. The crew were William Magruder (pilot), Paul Patten (copilot), Joseph Tomich (flight engineer), and Richard H. Edwards (flight test engineer). This is the first supersonic flight by a civilian airliner.

In total, 20 Concordes were built: two prototypes, two development aircraft and 16 production aircraft. Of the sixteen production aircraft, two did not enter commercial service and eight remained in service as of April 2003. All but two of these aircraft are preserved; the two that are not are F-BVFD (cn 211), parked as a spare-parts source in 1982 and scrapped in 1994, and F-BTSC (cn 203), which crashed outside Paris on July 25, 2000, killing 100 passengers, 9 crew members, and 4 people on the ground.

A total of sixteen airworthy Tupolev Tu-144s were built; a seventeenth Tu-144 (reg. 77116) was never completed. There was also at least one ground test airframe for static testing in parallel with the prototype 68001 development.

== Future development ==


The desire for a second-generation supersonic aircraft has remained within some elements of the aviation industry, and several concepts have emerged since the retirement of Concorde.

According to &quot;Aviation Week&quot;, the market for supersonic airliners costing $200 million could be 1,300 over a 10-year period, worth $260 billion. Development and certification is probably a $4 billion operation.

=== Previous concepts ===
In November 2003, EADS—the parent company of Airbus—announced that it was considering working with Japanese companies to develop a larger, faster replacement for Concorde. In October 2005, JAXA, the Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency, undertook aerodynamic testing of a scale model of an airliner designed to carry 300 passengers at Mach 2 (Next Generation Supersonic Transport, &quot;NEXST&quot;, then Zero Emission Hyper Sonic Transport). If pursued to commercial deployment, it would be expected to be in service around 2020–25.

In May 2008, it was reported that Aerion Corporation had $3 billion of pre-order sales on its Aerion SBJ supersonic business jet. In late 2010, the project continued with a testbed flight of a section of the wing. The Aerion AS2 was proposed as a 12-seat trijet, with a range of at Mach 1.4 over water or at Mach 0.95 over land, although &quot;boomless&quot; Mach 1.1 flight was claimed to be possible. Backed by Airbus and with 20 launch orders from Flexjet, first deliveries were pushed back from 2023 by two years when GE Aviation was selected in May 2017 for a joint engine study. In May 2021 the company announced that they would be ceasing operations due to inability to raise capital.

The SAI Quiet Supersonic Transport is a 12-passenger design from Lockheed Martin that is to cruise at Mach 1.6, and is to create a sonic boom only 1% as strong as that generated by Concorde.

The supersonic Tupolev Tu-444 or Gulfstream X-54 have also been proposed.

=== 2016–present ===

In March 2016, Boom Technology revealed that it is in the development phases of building a 40-passenger supersonic jet capable of flying Mach 1.7, claiming that the design simulation shows that it will be quieter and 30% more efficient than the Concorde and will be able to fly Los Angeles to Sydney in 6 hours. It is planned to go into service in 2029.

For its economic viability, NASA research since 2006 has focused on reducing the sonic boom to allow supersonic flight over land. In 2016, NASA announced it had signed a contract for the design of a modern low-noise SST prototype. The designing team is led by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics.
NASA should fly a low-boom demonstrator in 2019, reduced from double bangs to soft thumps by airframe shaping, to inquire community response, in support of a prospective FAA and ICAO ban lift in the early 2020s. The Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST X-plane will mimic the shockwave signature of a Mach 1.6 to 1.8, 80- to 100-seat airliner for 75 PNLdB compared with 105 PNLdB for Concorde.

The TsAGI exhibited at the 2017 MAKS Air Show in Moscow a scale model of its Supersonic Business Jet / Commercial Jet which should produce a low sonic boom permitting supersonic flight over land, optimised for cruise and range. The scientific research aims to optimise for both Mach 0.8–0.9 transonic and Mach 1.5–2.0 supersonic speeds, a similar design is tested in a wind tunnel while the engines are conceptualised at the Central Institute for Aviation Motors and designs are studied by Aviadvigatel and NPO Saturn.

At the October 2017 NBAA convention in Las Vegas, with NASA supporting only research, various companies faced engineering challenges to propose aircraft with no engine available, variable top speeds and operating models:

* The Boom XB-1 Baby Boom third-scale testbed, first test flown on on March 22, 2024, the aircraft is powered by three General Electric J-85-15 turbojets. On January 28, 2025, the aircraft reached speeds of Mach 1.122, making it the first human-piloted civil supersonic flight in an aircraft using an air-breathing engine since Concorde’s retirement.
* The Spike S-512 is a self-funded twinjet design aiming to cruise at Mach 1.6 over water for with 22 passengers in a windowless cabin, with unspecified engines. An SX-1.2-scale model was expected to have made its maiden flight in September 2017 before a manned testbed in 2019 and the prototype in 2021, with market availability for 2023 but so far, the airframe is still under development and the company have still not released any further information regarding what powerplant they plan to use.

Of the four billion air passengers in 2017, over 650 million flew long-haul between , including 72 million in business and first class, reaching 128 million by 2025; Spike projects 13 million would be interested in supersonic transport then.

In October 2018, the reauthorization of the FAA planned noise standards for supersonic transports, giving developers a regulatory certainty for their designs, mostly their engine choice.
Rules for supersonic flight-testing authorization in the U.S. and noise certification will be proposed by the FAA by early 2019. The FAA should make a proposition for landing-and-takeoff noise before March 31, 2020, for a rule after 2022; and for overland sonic boom from the end of 2020, while NASA plans to fly the Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST low-boom flight demonstrator from 2021 for ICAO standards in 2025.

In June 2019, inspired by the NASA quiet supersonic initiative and X-59 QueSST, Lockheed Martin unveiled the &quot;Quiet Supersonic Technology Airliner&quot;, a Mach 1.8, transpacific airliner concept for 40 passenger. Lower airport noise and sonic boom are allowed by shaped-boom design; integrated low-noise propulsion; swept-wing supersonic natural laminar flow; and the cockpit external vision system (XVS). The long design is significantly longer than the Concorde, featuring an almost long nose and a cabin. The sharply swept delta wing has a span, slightly narrower than the Concorde.

Design goals are a range and a takeoff field length, a 75-80 PLdB sonic boom and a cruise of Mach 1.6–1.7 over land and Mach 1.7-1.8 over water.
Twin tail-mounted nonafterburning engines are located between V-tails. Integrated low-noise propulsion include advanced plug nozzle designs, noise shielding concepts and distortion-tolerant fan blades.

In 2019, Exosonic, Inc was founded with the goal of developing a 70-passenger supersonic jet capable of flying Mach 1.8 and with a range of . The company was aiming to introduce the jet commercially in the 2030s. In April 2021, Exosonic was awarded a contract to develop a supersonic jet which could have been used for Air Force One.

In August 2020, Virgin Galactic with Rolls-Royce unveiled the concept of a Mach 3 capable twinjet delta wing aircraft that can carry up to 19 passengers.

NASA is working with 2 teams led by Boeing and Northrop Grumman on developing concepts for a Mach 4 airliner.

In April 2024, Boom received FAA licensure for Mach 1 and beyond tests of its XB-1 to be conducted at the Black Mountain Supersonic Corridor, in Mojave, California.

=== Hypersonic transport ===
While conventional turbo and ramjet engines are able to remain reasonably efficient up to Mach 5.5, some ideas for very high-speed flight above Mach 6 are also sometimes discussed, with the aim of reducing travel times down to one or two hours anywhere in the world. These vehicle proposals very typically either use rocket or scramjet engines; pulse detonation engines have also been proposed. There are many difficulties with such flight, both technical and economic.

Rocket-engined vehicles, while technically practical (either as ballistic transports or as semiballistic transports using wings), would use a very large amount of propellant and operate best at speeds between about Mach 8 and orbital speeds. Rockets compete best with air-breathing jet engines on cost at very long range; however, even for antipodal travel, costs would be only somewhat lower than orbital launch costs.

At the June 2011 Paris Air Show, EADS unveiled its ZEHST concept, cruising at at and attracting Japanese interest. The German SpaceLiner is a suborbital hypersonic winged passenger spaceplane project under preliminary development.

Precooled jet engines are jet engines with a heat exchanger at the inlet that cools the air at very high speeds. These engines may be practical and efficient at up to about Mach 5.5, and this is an area of research in Europe and Japan. The British company Reaction Engines Limited, with 50% EU money, has been engaged in a research programme called &quot;LAPCAT&quot;, which examined a design for a hydrogen-fueled plane carrying 300 passengers called the &quot;A2&quot;, potentially capable of flying at Mach 5+ nonstop from Brussels to Sydney in 4.6 hours. The follow-on research effort, &quot;LAPCAT II&quot; began in 2008 and was to last four years.

STRATOFLY MR3 is an EU research program (German Aerospace Center, ONERA and universities) with the goal of developing a cryogenic fuel 300-passenger airliner capable to fly at about 10,000 km/h (Mach 8) above 30 km of altitude.

Destinus, Hermeus, and Venus Aerospace are developing hypersonic passenger aircraft.

Boeing unveiled at the AIAA 2018 conference a passenger airliner. Crossing the Atlantic in 2 hours or the Pacific in 3 at would enable same-day return flights, increasing airlines&#x27; asset utilization. Using a titanium airframe, its capacity would be smaller than a Boeing 737 but larger than a long-range business jet. A reusable demonstrator could be flown as early as 2023 or 2024 for a potential entry into service from the late 2030s. Aerodynamics would benefit from the Boeing X-51 Waverider experience, riding the leading edge shockwave for lower induced drag. Flow control would enhance lift at slower speeds, and avoiding afterburners on takeoff would reduce noise. The Boeing hypersonic airliner would be powered by a turboramjet, a turbofan that transitions to a ramjet at Mach 6 would avoid the need for a scramjet, similar to the SR-71 Blackbird&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney J58, but shutting off the turbine at higher speeds. It would be integrated in an axisymmetric annular layout with a single intake and nozzle, and a bypass duct around the turbine engine to a combination afterburner/ramjet at the rear. It would need advanced cooling technology like the heat exchanger developed by Reaction Engines, maybe using liquid methane and/or jet fuel. Cruising at makes depressurization a higher risk. Mach 6 was chosen as the limit achievable with available technology. It would have a high capacity utilization, being able to cross the Atlantic four or five times a day, up from a possible twice a day with the Concorde.

<doc id="215931" wikidata="Q515556" url="?curid=215931" title="Bristlecone pine">
<text>The term bristlecone pine covers three species of pine tree (family Pinaceae, genus &quot;Pinus&quot;, subsection &quot;Balfourianae&quot;). All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh weather and bad soils. One of the three species, &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;, is among the longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest of this species is more than 4,800 years old, making it the oldest known individual of any species. Many scientists are curious as to why this tree is able to live so long. In one study, they discovered that &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; has higher levels of telomerase activity, which further slows or prevents the attrition rate of telomeres. This potentially contributes to the extended life of the bristlecone pine.

Despite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines, particularly &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;, are usually a first-succession species, tending to occupy new open ground. They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard to cultivate. In gardens, they succumb quickly to root rot. They do very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky dolomitic soils in areas with virtually no rainfall.

Bristlecone pines grow in scattered subalpine groves at high altitude in arid regions of the Western United States. Bristlecones, along with all related species in class Pinopsida, are cone-bearing seed plants commonly known as conifers; the name comes from the prickles on the female cones.

== Species and range ==

There are three closely related species of bristlecone pines:
* Great Basin bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;) in Utah, Nevada and eastern California. The famous longest-lived species; often the term &quot;bristlecone pine&quot; refers to this tree in particular.
* Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus aristata&quot;) in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. The most populous species; capable of forming closed canopies and, unlike the other two, is commonly cultivated.
* Foxtail pine (&quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot;) with two disjunct populations found in the Klamath Mountains (subspecies &quot;balfouriana&quot;) and the southern Sierra Nevada (subspecies &quot;austrina&quot;). A small outlying population was reported in southern Oregon, but was proven to have been misidentified. Forms the thickest groves of the three.

At least some of the three species can hybridize in cultivation, but the ranges of wild populations do not overlap. The Colorado River and Green River produce a gap between the ranges of &quot;P. longaeva&quot; and &quot;P. aristata&quot; and the northern Owens Valley provides a gap between the ranges of &quot;P. longaeva&quot; and &quot;P. balfouriana&quot;.

== Description ==
Bristlecone pines grow in isolated groves just below the tree line, between elevation on dolomitic soils. The trees grow in soils that are shallow lithosols, usually derived from dolomite and sometimes limestone, and occasionally sandstone or quartzite soils. Dolomitic soils are alkaline, high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. Those factors tend to exclude other plant species, allowing bristlecones to thrive. Because of cold temperatures, dry soils, high winds, and short growing seasons, the trees grow very slowly. Even the tree&#x27;s needles, which grow in bunches of five, can remain on the tree for forty years, which gives the tree&#x27;s terminal branches the unique appearance of a long bottle brush.

The bristlecone pine&#x27;s root system is mostly composed of highly branched, shallow roots, while a few large, branching roots provide structural support.
The bristlecone pine is extremely drought tolerant due to its branched shallow root system, its waxy needles, and thick needle cuticles that aid in water retention.
The wood is very dense and resinous, and thus resistant to invasion by insects, fungi, and other potential pests. The tree&#x27;s longevity is due in part to the wood&#x27;s extreme durability. While other species of trees that grow nearby suffer rot, bare bristlecone pines can endure, even after death, often still standing on their roots, for many centuries. Exposed wood on living and dead trees does not rot, but rather erodes like stone due to wind, rain, and freezing, which creates unusual forms and shapes.

The bristlecone pine has an intrinsically low rate of reproduction and regeneration, and it is thought that under present climatic and environmental conditions the rate of regeneration may be insufficient to sustain its population. The species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. The species are labeled under Least Concern (LC), the justification for this being that no subpopulations for Great Basin bristlecone pines are decreasing. Subpopulations seem to be increasing or remaining stable. Many bristlecone pine habitats have been protected, including the Inyo National Forest&#x27;s Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of California and the Great Basin National Park in Nevada, where cutting or gathering wood is prohibited.
The green pine needles give the twisted branches a bottle-brush appearance. The needles of the tree surround the branch to an extent of about one foot near the tip of the limb. The name bristlecone pine refers to the dark purple female cones that bear incurved prickles on their surface. The dark color of these cones helps to absorb heat. After maturity, which takes about two years, the cones will become brown in color. These ancient trees have a gnarled and stunted appearance, especially those found at high altitudes, and have reddish-brown bark with deep fissures. As the tree ages, much of its vascular cambium layer may die. In very old specimens, often only a narrow strip of living tissue connects the roots to a handful of live branches. Even though the trees&#x27; needles may age, they still remain functional in regulating water and by their ability to photosynthesize.
== Oldest living organisms ==

Bristlecone pines are known for attaining great ages. The oldest bristlecone pine in the White Mountains is Methuselah, which has a verified age of years. It is located in the White Mountains of Inyo County in Eastern California. However, the specific location of Methuselah is a closely guarded secret.

The other two species, &quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot; and &quot;Pinus aristata&quot;, are also long-lived, though not to the extreme extent of &quot;P. longaeva&quot;; specimens of both have been measured or estimated to be up to 3,000 years old. The longevity of the trees is believed to be related to the proportion of dead wood to live wood. This high ratio reduces respiration and water loss, thereby extending the life of the tree.

Trees that reproduce by cloning can be considered to be much older than bristlecone pines. A colony of 47,000 quaking aspen trees (nicknamed &quot;Pando&quot;), covering in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah, United States, has been estimated to be 80,000 years old, although tree ring samples date individual, above-ground trees at an average of about 130 years.

Bristlecone pines are invaluable to dendroclimatologists, because they provide the longest continual climatically sensitive tree-ring chronologies on Earth. By cross-dating millennia-old bristlecone pine debris, some chronologies reach beyond 9,000 years before present. In addition, ratios of stable carbon isotopes from bristlecone pine tree rings are sensitive to past variations in moisture availability. This information can be used to reconstruct precipitation changes in the past.

The Rocky Mountain population is severely threatened by an introduced fungal disease known as white pine blister rust, and by mountain pine beetles. Climate change may also affect the species as temperatures increased over a 30-year period throughout the southern Rocky Mountain range. These changes in climate would mostly affect trees in higher elevations. With these problems, the genetic diversity within the species has become a concern; old specimens of bristlecone pine, however, have survived previous warmer periods.

<doc id="215933" wikidata="Q29529184" url="?curid=215933" title="List of governors of Mississippi">
<text>The governor of Mississippi is the head of government of Mississippi and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Mississippi Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, and, except in cases of treason or impeachment, to grant pardons and reprieves.

To be elected governor, a person must be at least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of the United States for twenty years and a resident of Mississippi for at least five years at the time of inauguration. The Constitution of Mississippi, ratified in 1890, calls for a four-year term for the governor, elected via the two-round system since a 2020 referendum. Prior to this, the governor was elected by an electoral college composed of the districts represented in the Mississippi House of Representatives, with a contingent election held in the House in the event no candidate received a majority of district electors. The term length was originally two years, with no limit on how many terms they could serve. The 1832 constitution limited governors to serving no more than four out of every six years. When terms were lengthened to four years in 1868, this limit was removed. The 1890 constitution forbid governors from succeeding themselves, but a 1986 amendment allows them to succeed themselves once. The office of the lieutenant governor was created in the 1817 constitution, abolished in 1832, and recreated in 1868. When the office of governor becomes vacant for any reason, the lieutenant governor exercises the powers of governor for the remainder of the term. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

The current governor is Republican Tate Reeves, who took office January 14, 2020.

== List of governors ==
=== Mississippi Territory ===
Mississippi Territory was organized on April 7, 1798, from land ceded to the federal government by Georgia. It had four governors appointed by the president of the United States during its 19-year history, including one, David Holmes, who would later serve as state governor.

=== State of Mississippi ===
Mississippi was admitted to the Union on December 10, 1817. It seceded from the Union on January 9, 1861, and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. During the Reconstruction era following the end of the American Civil War, Mississippi was part of the Fourth Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Mississippi was readmitted to the Union on February 23, 1870.

<text>Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual consent. Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its everyday meaning. For example, a person with a mental disorder, a low mental age, or under the legal age of sexual consent may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law.

United Nations agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a comprehensive sexuality education is beneficial. Types of consent include implied consent, express consent, informed consent and unanimous consent.

==Types==
* An expression of consent is one that is unmistakably stated, rather than implied. It may be given in writing, e.g. contract, by speech (orally), or non-verbally, e.g. by a clear gesture such as a nod. Non-written express consent not evidenced by witnesses or an audio or video recording may be disputed if a party denies that it was given.
* Implied consent is consent inferred from a person&#x27;s actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person&#x27;s silence or inaction). Examples include unambiguously soliciting or initiating sexual activity or the implied consent to physical contact by participants in a hockey game or being assaulted in a boxing match. 
* Informed consent in medicine is consent given by a person who has a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and future consequences of an action. The term is also used in other contexts, such as in social scientific research, when participants are asked to affirm that they understand the research procedure and consent to it, or in sex, where informed consent means each person engaging in sexual activity is aware of any positive statuses (for sexually transmitted infections and/or diseases) they might expose themselves to.
* Unanimous consent, or general consent, by a group of several parties (e.g., an association) is consent given by all parties.
* Substituted consent, or the substituted judgment doctrine, allows a decision maker to attempt to establish the decision an incompetent person would have made if they were competent.
* Advance consent, where consent is given in advance, is generally considered not valid with certain exceptions depending on jurisdiction for advance healthcare directives, commercial contracts, and other.
* Consent can be defined according to substantive equality. 
* In international law, consent involves states, not individuals. Consent is a crucial principle of international law that necessitates the agreement of all relevant parties for any changes in rules to be legally binding. However, some legal scholars propose that a consensus among states, rather than the explicit consent of each state, may be the standard by which a rule is considered obligatory and enforceable.

== Internet and digital services ==
The concept of end-user given consent plays an important role in digital regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR (Article 6) defines a set of different legal bases for lawful processing of personal data. End-users&#x27; consent is only one of these possible bases. However, as a result of the GDPR enforcement (in 2018) and other legal obligations, data controllers (online service providers) have widely developed consent-obtaining mechanisms in recent years. According to the GDPR, end-users&#x27; consent should be &quot;valid&quot;, &quot;freely given&quot;, &quot;specific&quot;, &quot;informed&quot; and &quot;active&quot;.&quot;&quot; But the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge in the digital world. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the Big Tech, i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM), use dark patterns in their consent obtaining mechanisms, which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the obtained consent.

==Tort==

Consent can be either expressed or implied. For example, participation in a contact sport usually implies consent to a degree of contact with other participants, implicitly agreed and often defined by the rules of the sport. Another specific example is where a boxer cannot complain of being punched on the nose by an opponent; implied consent will be valid where the violence is ordinarily and reasonably to be contemplated as incidental to the sport in question. Express consent exists when there is oral or written agreement, particularly in a contract. For example, businesses may require that persons sign a waiver (called a liability waiver) acknowledging and accepting the hazards of an activity. This proves express consent, and prevents the person from filing a tort lawsuit for unauthorised actions.

In English law, the principle of &quot;volenti non fit injuria&quot; (Latin: &quot;to a willing person, injury is not done&quot;) applies not only to participants in sport, but also to spectators and to any others who willingly engage in activities where there is a risk of injury. Consent has also been used as a defense in cases involving accidental deaths during sex, which occur during sexual bondage. &quot;Time&quot; (May 23, 1988) referred to this latter example, as the &quot;rough-sex defense&quot;. It is not effective in English law in cases of serious injury or death.

As a term of jurisprudence prior provision of consent signifies a possible defence (an excuse or justification) against civil or criminal liability. Defendants who use this defense are arguing that they should not be held liable for a tort or a crime, since the actions in question took place with the plaintiff or &quot;victim&#x27;s&quot; prior consent and permission.

==Medicine==

In medical law, consent is important to protect a medical practitioner from liability for harm to a patient arising from a procedure. There are exemptions, such as when the patient is unable to give consent.

Also, a medical practitioner must explain the significant risks of a procedure or medication (those that might change the patient&#x27;s mind about whether or not to proceed with the treatment) before the patient can give a binding consent. This was explored in Australia in &quot;Rogers v Whitaker&quot;. If a practitioner does not explain a material risk that subsequently eventuates, then that is considered negligent. These material risks include the loss of chance of a better result if a more experienced surgeon had performed the procedure.
In the UK, a Supreme Court judgment modernized the law on consent and introduced a patient-focused test to UK law: allowing the patient rather than the medical professionals to decide upon the level of risk they wish to take in terms of a particular course of action, given all the information available. This change reflects the Guidance of the General Medical Council on the requirement to consent patients, and removes the rule of medical paternalism.

== Social science research ==
Social scientists are generally required to obtain informed consent from research participants before asking interview questions or conducting an experiment. Federal law governs social science research that involves human subjects, and tasks institutional review boards (IRBs) at universities, federal or state agencies, and tribal organizations to oversee social science research that involves human subjects and to make decisions about whether or not informed consent is necessary for a social scientific study to go forward. Informed consent in this context generally means explaining the study&#x27;s purpose to research participants and obtaining a signed or verbal affirmation that the study participants understand the procedures to be used and to consent to participate in the study.

Some types of social scientific research, such as psychological experiments, may use deception as part of the study; in these cases, researchers may not fully describe the procedures to participants, and thus participants are not fully informed. However, researchers are required to debrief participants immediately after the experiment is concluded. Certain populations are considered to be vulnerable, and in addition to informed consent, special protections must be made available to them. These include persons who are incarcerated, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and persons who have a mental disability. Children are considered unable to provide informed consent.

==Planning law==

Some countries, such as New Zealand with its Resource Management Act and its Building Act, use the term &quot;consent&quot; for the legal process that provide planning permission for developments like subdivisions, bridges or buildings. Achieving permission results in getting &quot;Resource consent&quot; or &quot;Building consent&quot;.

==Sexual activity==

In Canada, &quot;consent means [...] the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity&quot; without abuse or exploitation of &quot;trust, power or authority&quot;, coercion or threats. Consent can also be revoked at any moment. The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that badgering alone, followed by an agreement, does not meet the threshold of coercion to vitiate consent.

Sexual consent plays an important role in defining what sexual assault is, since sexual activity without consent by all parties is rape. In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that we must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than &quot;no means no&quot; or &quot;yes means yes&quot;. Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.

Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of &quot;yes means yes&quot; and affirmative models, such as Hall&#x27;s definition: &quot;the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment.&quot; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be &quot;free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness&#x27; to engage in sexual activity.&quot; Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the &quot;yes means yes&quot;, or in the &quot;no means no&quot;, model.

Some individuals are unable to give consent. Minors below a certain age, the age of sexual consent in that jurisdiction, are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. Likewise, persons with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or similar disabilities may be unable to give legal consent to sexual relations even with their spouse.

Within literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus. Roffee argued that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrated how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime. Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting. Similarly, some children under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However the law does not view this as legitimate. Whilst there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.

Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula. In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on &quot;consensual sexual relationships,&quot; &quot;the meaning and importance of consent&quot; as well as &quot;rape myths&quot;. In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school&#x27;s policies. In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication.

===Affirmative consent===
Affirmative consent (enthusiastic yes) is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures. It involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S., which describe consent as an &quot;affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.&quot; According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., &quot;Instead of saying &#x27;no means no,&#x27; &#x27;yes means yes&#x27; looks at sex as a positive thing.&quot; Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties&#x27; relationship, prior sexual history or current activity (&quot;Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity,&quot; a university policy reads). By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.

There are 3 pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or &quot;the way we let others know what we&#x27;re up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex.&quot;

They are:

# Knowing exactly what and how much I&#x27;m agreeing to
# Expressing my intent to participate
# Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate

To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say &quot;no&quot;, one gives and seeks an explicit &quot;yes&quot;. This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it is unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. &quot;There&#x27;s varying language, but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior,&quot; said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. &quot;It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault. It&#x27;s requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior.&quot;

=== Critiques of affirmative consent ===

The above concept of affirmative consent has become more mainstream and promoted in public discourse, institutions and the workplace, especially following the #MeToo scandals. However, feminists from varying political backgrounds have voiced concerns and critiques of affirmative consent as a solution to both sexual assault and creating sexual equality and autonomy between all genders. If women, queer people and other marginalized groups are not free to say no, why would they be free to say yes? Feminists have been seeking for more transformative alternatives that go beyond a (verbal) agreement between sexual partners, examining the issue as a political question related to power structures, the influence of neoliberal perceptions of the self and the complexity of human desire.

==== Neoliberal contractualism and rationalism ====

The common form of affirmative consent assumes that humans act as rational and independent beings who, at any point in any interaction, are fully aware of what they are (not) consenting to, whether they want to and are able to make a conscious, valid decision. Consent, as it is practiced now, thus requires us to rationalize desires and prioritizes thinking over feeling, and reason over emotions. The resulting consent is shaped in a neoliberal form of contractualism which makes a withdrawal of consent or a change in the conditions of the activity at stake rather challenging. This form of consent as a contract is assuming consent to happen between two (or more) individual and rational actors and it does not give room to forms of discomfort, vulnerability or discussion within the practice consented to. Additionally, this contractualism mostly relies on verbal, affirmative consent and overlooks non-verbal or alternative ways of consenting. The latter is rather essentializing signs of affirmation and, due to its reliance on verbal consent in form of understandable words, can be ableist by invalidating non-verbal consent. Furthermore, contractualism assumes consent to be rational by nature and implies that we always know rationally whether or not we want to consent to something. However, especially in the sphere of interpersonal sexual and non-sexual activities, our own needs or desires are not always rational but can rather be ambiguous, contradicting or unclear. Consent in the form of neoliberal contractualism is unable to include and reflect this ambiguity and the lack of rationality.

==== Socio-cultural vs legal debate ====
Arguably, there is a distinction that is rarely made in the debate around consent: the socio-cultural and the legal. While talking about consent, arguments are often informed and talked about in a legal framework: What do we need to be protected in the current legal framework? Which formulations give the best protection to victims of sexual violence? However, when talking about this particular protection there is also a need for protection through prevention, a protection by society rather than the law.

While it is not necessarily a given that affirmative consent provides the best legal protection for victims without taking away their agency, there is another danger in linking the legal debate and our overall understanding of consent. Relying on the legal framework and presenting these as the question of consent takes away the need for change and discussion on the socio-cultural level that has the potential to offer even more complexity, flexibility and room to rethink our sexual and overall encounters beyond the protection against violence. A socio-cultural debate would be one around our needs, attitudes and behaviors and the changes needed, which arguably is a more complex debate to hold and handle. With a certain level of protection this complexity is needed though to rethink our encounters beyond the mantras of &#x27;no means no&#x27; and &#x27;only yes means yes&#x27;, something that is not reductionist to be applied in a legal setting and that gives the possibility to imagine interactions beyond the current status quo.

<doc id="215936" wikidata="Q6080011" url="?curid=215936" title="Ishaq Shahryar">
<text>Ishaq M. Shahryar (January 10, 1936 – April 12, 2009) was the inventor of the low-cost photovoltaic cell and the first Afghan ambassador to the United States since the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. &quot;New Scientist&quot; named Shahryar &quot;the Sun King,&quot; recognizing his virtual invention of solar power as a serious energy source and honoring his dedication to reinventing Afghan villages through solar power and increased business opportunities.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, Shahryar received a government scholarship in 1956 to study at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara, where he earned his Bachelor&#x27;s in Physical Chemistry and his Master&#x27;s in International Relations. 

== Technical career ==
On graduation, Shahryar worked as an engineer and became an integral part of NASA&#x27;s Jupiter Project. In the early 1970s, Shahryar took a job at Spectrolab, a division of Textron. There, with support from Bill Yerkes, he invented the first terrestrial solar cell in 1972 and developed the process of screen-printing cells on solar panels, which is still used in the market today. The company was purchased by Hughes Aircraft in 1975, and the terrestrial division was closed. Shahryar founded his own company, Solec International, followed by Solar Utility Company and Sun King Solar in Los Angeles.

Shahryar&#x27;s patents continued to lower the cost of solar energy in order to utilize the energy source more broadly. In 1987, Solec provided the solar cells for an electric racecar being built by the hair care entrepreneur and billionaire John Paul DeJoria, who later became his business partner. The Ferris wheel at the Santa Monica Pier operates on a photovoltaic system designed by Solar Utility Inc. The same system provides power for the parking structure at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Solar-powered emergency call boxes dotting local freeways were designed by Shahryar. So were solar-powered lighting systems used in some bus shelters and billboards. His latest endeavor, Global Energy, aimed to reduce the cost of electricity to 6 or 7 cents a kilowatt in order to develop largely solar-powered model villages in underdeveloped nations.

== Political career ==
While working in solar energy, in 1994, Shahryar was named to the U.S. Presidential Mission on Sustainable Energy and Trade to India and has acted as an adviser to numerous trade and environmental groups in the United States and abroad.

Alongside his achievements in the solar industry, Shahryar remained involved in mitigating the plight of Afghan immigrants and in the politics of Afghanistan. Shahryar brought over 60 members of his family to the United States after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and was a patron to the entire Afghan community throughout his life. Shahryar also served as an advisor to the exiled Afghan King Zahir Shah, and was a delegate at the Bonn Conference of 2001 that established Afghanistan&#x27;s post-invasion roadmap.

In 2002, Shahryar was appointed as the Afghan ambassador to the United States. He renounced U.S. citizenship and closed his companies in order to take up the position. It is widely accepted that he served as ambassador for free and used much of his personal fortune to not only work on the embassy, but also on many social and developmental projects inside Afghanistan. Shahryar hosted President Bush&#x27;s first visit to an embassy in September 2002. Shahryar created important light and warmth in the renewed U.S.-Afghan relationship and acted as a figure of liberalism, modernization, and women&#x27;s rights in Afghanistan. He was named Ambassador of the Year by the World Affairs Council in 2002. In 2003, Shahryar resigned due to corruption and major roadblocks in the Afghan government, saying that &quot; Karzai &quot;has no vision–absolutely no vision, no quality for leadership.&quot;

==Death==
Shahryar died on April 12, 2009, in Pacific Palisades, California. He left behind a wife, Hafizah, a son named Alexander Shahryar and a daughter named Jahan Shahryar. His memorial was held at the Hall of Liberty in Hollywood Hills.

<doc id="215940" wikidata="Q444194" url="?curid=215940" title="Ronnie Musgrove">
<text>David Ronald Musgrove (born July 29, 1956) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 62nd governor of Mississippi from 2000 to 2004. A Democrat, he previously served as the 29th lieutenant governor of Mississippi from 1996 to 2000. He was the Democratic nominee in the 2008 special election for one of Mississippi&#x27;s seats in the United States Senate, losing to incumbent Senator Roger Wicker. Musgrove is a principal at a public affairs consulting firm, Politics. In 2014, he became founding partner of a new law firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Musgrove/Smith Law. As of 2024, he is the most recent Democrat to hold the office of Governor of Mississippi.

==Early life==
David Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Musgrove was born on July 29, 1956, in Sardis, Mississippi. He was raised in Tocowa and the city of Batesville. He had four siblings. His mother was a textile factory worker and his father was a road crew worker for the Mississippi Highway Department. When Musgrove was seven years old, his father caught pneumonia while laboring during a snowstorm and died. He attended Northwest Mississippi Junior College, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Mississippi School of Law.

== State Senate ==
In 1987, Musgrove ran for the District 10 seat of the Mississippi State Senate, representing Panola and Tate counties, which was being vacated by its incumbent. He defeated Price Darby in an August Democratic primary runoff and won the November general election. After being seated in January 1988, Musgrove was appointed vice chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Universities and Colleges Committee and made a member of the Education Committee.

Despite rumors that he would seek the office of Attorney General of Mississippi in 1991, Musgrove chose to seek reelection to the Senate. He ran unopposed and was reelected. At the onset of his second term in January 1992, he was named chairman of the Education Committee.

== Lieutenant governor ==
In 1995 Musgrove ran as the Democratic candidate for the office of lieutenant governor of Mississippi, facing one-term Republican incumbent Eddie Briggs. Briggs refused to debate his opponent, and Musgrove accused him of hypocrisy for not releasing his tax returns when he had demanded the same of Brad Dye, whom he had defeated four years prior. Briggs also distanced himself from Republican Kirk Fordice&#x27;s gubernatorial reelection campaign due to personal differences between the two.

On November 7, the election was held and Musgrove won, taking 52 percent of the vote. He was sworn-in as lieutenant governor on January 4, 1996. In an attempt to contrast himself from his predecessor, he began his tenure by indicating he was open to cooperation with Governor Fordice. As lieutenant governor, Musgrove was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, chairing it in 1999. His service on the board allowed him to garner significant experience in budgeting.

Shortly after being elected lieutenant governor, Musgrove was seriously injured in a car accident while traveling on official state business. After Fordice was gravely injured in a car accident, Musgrove served as acting governor from November 7 to December 17, 1996. While serving in an acting capacity in Fordice&#x27;s absence, Musgrove limited his activities to signing proclamations, processing extraditions, declaring weather-related emergencies and making appointments recommended by Fordice&#x27;s staff. At the time, Musgrove was quoted as saying, &quot;When we&#x27;re confronted by these types of matters, politics has to be put on the back burner and we have to do the right thing.&quot;

After taking office, Musgrove named Black senators to chair several Senate committees, including those concerning the judiciary, constitution, elections, and universities and colleges.

Differences later emerged between Fordice and Musgrove over the latter&#x27;s support of public education. After the governor vetoed the Mississippi Adequate Education Act in 1987, Musgrove lobbied for the legislature to override Fordice&#x27;s decision.

In 1998 Musgrove chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors. After the 1999 elections but before the official end of his tenure, Musgrove turned over the lieutenant governor&#x27;s offices to Lieutenant Governor-elect Amy Tuck so as to ease her assumption of the position.

== Governor of Mississippi ==
=== 1999 election ===

Musgrove ran for the office of governor in 1999, having hired a full-time fundraiser and a political consultant to mount such a campaign two years prior. He won the August 3 Democratic primary, taking 57 percent of the vote and defeating former state Supreme Court justice Jim Roberts, though Roberts had damaged his credibility by questioning his use of state vehicles for campaign activities. In the general election he faced Republican former U.S. Representative Mike Parker.

Musgrove focused on education advancements, running a series of television ads showcasing his accomplishments as lieutenant governor in supporting elementary and secondary school improvements. He also ran a significant amount of campaign ads on Christian radio stations and espoused socially conservative positions such as opposition to abortion. Parker largely campaigned on his personality, focusing on his background in Mississippi and his experience in government. As a result, Musgrove criticized him for being &quot;issueless&quot;, to which Parker responded that he was not &quot;going to play this gotcha politics.&quot;

Musgrove also spent a significant amount of time traveling and hosting events while his campaign staff innovated with using traffic density maps to strategically place campaign signs and deployed get out the vote efforts in every county. In contrast, Parker relied largely on his radio and television ads to promote his campaign. During the last week of the campaign, Musgrove continued attending events while his campaign printed newspaper ads which attacked Parker for depriving rural hospitals of funding by voting in favor of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, generating a significant amount of public interest. The congressman in turn played at a charity golf tournament during the last day before the election.

The 1999 gubernatorial election was the closest in Mississippi history; Musgrove earned an advantage in the popular vote, taking 379,033 votes to Parker&#x27;s 370,691. As there were two minor independent candidates, Musgrove fell 0.38 percent short of receiving a majority as required by the Constitution of Mississippi. Since neither candidate received a majority of the popular vote, had each won 61 of the state&#x27;s 122 electoral districts (state house districts), and Parker refused to concede, the Mississippi House of Representatives was required to hold a contingent election to select the winner. On January 4, 2000, the House convened and voted in favor of seating Musgrove, 86 to 36, in a mostly partisan vote. It was the only time the election of a Mississippi governor was decided by the Mississippi House, as a 2020 referendum abolished the electoral vote requirement and replaced a contingent election with a runoff election between the top two candidates.

=== Tenure ===
Due to the short time frame between his election as governor and the date of his inauguration on January 11, 2000, Musgrove entered gubernatorial office with an incomplete staff. He entered office with the intent to reform government institutions, specifically public education.

As Governor, Musgrove served as chair or vice chair of a number of boards and associations, including the National Governors Association (vice chair), the Southern Regional Education Board (chair), the Southern States Energy Board (chair elect), the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (chair elect) and the Executive Committee for the Democratic Governors Association (vice chair of policy).

As governor, Musgrove presided over what is still considered the largest economic development project in Mississippi history. In August 2000, he launched the Advantage Mississippi Initiative (AMI) to create new jobs for the state, which brought in a new Nissan Motor Company production plant. Nissan&#x27;s arrival gave legitimacy to the notion that the Southeastern United States could become an automotive manufacturing leader. Musgrove&#x27;s AMI economic development package also helped set in motion the mechanics needed to recruit Toyota to Blue Springs.

In 2000, Musgrove signed a bill into law banning same-sex couples from adopting children, making Mississippi only the third state to have done so. The law also says that Mississippi will not recognize adoptions from other states by same-sex couples.

Beginning in the 1980s, Mississippi lawyers won a series of large damage suits against corporations, resulting in large payouts to the plaintiffs they represented and significant profits for the attorneys. As a result, damage suit attorneys&#x27; political influence increased and by the early 2000s were one of the largest sources of campaign contributions for Democratic candidates in the state. In response, the business community began increasingly funding pro-tort reform candidates who would support new limits on the lawsuits. In late 2001, the press began to publish exposes on the damage suit attorneys, which, combined with a series of lawsuits against hospitals and medical practices, led to increased public support for reform. On August 23, 2002, Musgrove announced to a group of campaign contributors—all of them trial lawyers—his intention to call the legislature into special session to consider tort reform proposals. When asked for his reasons, Musgrove told them that he was under intense political pressure to act.

The tort reform special session opened on September 5. By the time it closed on November 26, it was the longest-lasting special session in Mississippi history. The legislature adopted several new laws restricting damage suits, including caps on punitive damages in cases involving businesses and instances of medical malpractice. Despite the success of the session he had called, Musgrove garnered no obvious political advantage from the enactment of the reforms, and Democrats&#x27; fundraising efforts in the state were left compromised.

=== 2003 election ===

In 2003 Musgrove ran for re-election, facing Republican challenger Haley Barbour. Musgrove targeted his critiques of his opponent on the latter&#x27;s career as a lobbyist. Barbour defeated Musgrove in the general election.

== Later political activities ==

After losing his re-election bid Musgrove returned to private practice with the law firm of Copeland, Cook, Taylor &amp; Bush, P.A. in Ridgeland, Mississippi. On January 4, 2008, Musgrove confirmed that he would be a candidate in the 2008 United States Senate special election in Mississippi against Republican incumbent Roger Wicker. Wicker, a former congressman, was appointed to the Senate seat by Governor Barbour after Trent Lott resigned.

Musgrove initially led in statewide polling conducted in April due to his greater name recognition. Wicker eroded this lead by associating himself with conservative causes and attacking Musgrove as a liberal who had provoked budget issues during his gubernatorial administration and attempted to alter the state flag. Musgrove in turn attacked Wicker for voting to raise congressional salaries. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, optimistic about a high black Democratic-leaning turnout during the election due to Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential candidacy, intervened to launch television attack ads against Wicker, though Wicker also benefitted from outside Republican financial support. 
Late in the race, polls indicated Wicker had a sizeable lead, though &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; endorsed Musgrove, citing his support of education and child healthcare. Wicker won with 55 percent of the vote.

Musgrove has remained active in public service since leaving office, continuing to serve on a number of boards and commissions that advocate for quality education and better access to health care for rural and low income families. In February 2013, Musgrove joined a former aide in launching a government relations consulting firm, Company.Politics.

==Political views==
As governor, Musgrove had conservative social views, enacting laws restricting homosexual couples from adopting children and requiring that the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; appear in all classrooms in Mississippi. He also had an anti-abortion record as governor.

===Education===
During his tenure, Musgrove was known as the education governor. In July 2001, Governor Musgrove signed a bill that implemented the largest teacher pay increase in state history—raising teacher&#x27;s pay in Mississippi to the Southeastern average. Under Governor Musgrove, the Princeton Review reported that school accountability standards in Mississippi went from 50th nationally to the top 20. In 2002, Mississippi was the first state in the nation to have a computer with internet access in every classroom.

===Healthcare===
When Governor Musgrove took office in January 2000, fewer than 525 Mississippi children were enrolled in Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). At the time, Mississippi had more than 85,000 children that were eligible to receive health insurance benefits through the Mississippi Health Benefits Program, which provides health insurance to Mississippi&#x27;s children whose parents are caught in the gap between making too much money to be eligible for Medicaid, but not enough to afford health insurance. Governor Musgrove joined with the Department of Human Services, the Division of Medicaid and the Department of Finance and Administration to develop a new action plan and marketing plan for CHIP. By the time he left office, the number of children covered under CHIP had increased to over 60,000. Governor Musgrove is currently chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, and co-chairman of the Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee.

===Religion===
In August 2003, Musgrove wrote Alabama Supreme Court judge Roy Moore on state letterhead to praise the judge&#x27;s Ten Commandments monument, inviting the judge to display the monument in the Mississippi State Capitol for a week the following month and announcing his intention to encourage other governors to follow suit. Musgrove further wrote, &quot;It would be my honor to host this monument as a symbol of every Mississippian&#x27;s dedication to the fundamental principles of the Ten Commandments.&quot;

In 2001, Musgrove signed legislation requiring the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to be displayed in every public school classroom, as well as the school auditoriums and cafeterias, throughout the state.

===Mississippi state flag===
Mississippi&#x27;s state flag featured the Confederate Battle Flag prominently. In 2000, the Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled that the Mississippi flag, a source of division among white and black Mississippians, was not official. A court ruled the flag was officially adopted in 1894, but the law designating the state flag was not among those carried forward in a 1906 update of the state code. The judges left the decision on whether to adopt the flag to the legislative and executive branches.

In response to the ruling, Musgrove held a press conference to announce that he had issued an executive order creating a 17-member commission to study the flag. In the executive order, Musgrove also called for continuing the use of the flag until the legislature had received and reviewed the committee&#x27;s report. During the press conference, flanked by a U.S. flag and the controversial state flag, Musgrove offered no indication of his opinion on the current flag or any possible future design.

The commission eventually came up with a new design that replaced the battle flag in the canton with a circular array of twenty stars (Mississippi is the 20th state) on a blue background. As campaigning for the flags began leading up to a referendum, Musgrove did endorse the new flag. A referendum was held in April 2001 to determine whether the new flag would be adopted. The 1894 flag won by a vote of 65% to 35%.

==Personal life==
In 1977 Musgrove married Melanie Ballard. In 2001, while Musgrove was governor, the couple divorced after 24 years of marriage. The couple had two children. The results and settlement of the divorce were sealed by the judge at the request of the Musgroves. Musgrove married Dr. Melody Bruce Bounds on August 4, 2007. Melody Musgrove died of leukemia at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota on September 27, 2021. He also teaches classes at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, as well as at Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson, Mississippi.

<doc id="215943" wikidata="Q1453819" url="?curid=215943" title="George Weinberg (psychologist)">
<text>George Weinberg (May 17, 1929 – March 20, 2017) was a Jewish-American psychologist. He was the author of several books. He coined the term &quot;homophobia&quot; in the 1960s, it first appearing in the press in 1969.

==Early life==
George Weinberg was born on May 17, 1929, to a Jewish family. His father, Frederick Weinberg, was a lawyer while his mother, Lillian Hyman, was a secretary for a law firm. He grew up without his father in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.

Weinberg graduated from City College of New York, and went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in English from New York University in 1951, where he also studied statistics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He subsequently earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from Columbia University. Weinberg&#x27;s extensive background in mathematics was reflected in his doctoral thesis, &quot;Clinical versus Statistical Prediction in Psychology&quot;, and he later wrote the textbook, &quot;Statistics, An Intuitive Approach&quot;.

==Career==
Weinberg coined the term &quot;homophobia&quot;. He began contemplating it after remembering having witnessed abhorrence towards a lesbian friend while preparing to deliver a speech in 1965. The word was first printed in &quot;Screw&quot; on May 5, 1969, followed by &quot;Time&quot; a few months later. &quot;Gay Times&quot; stated after his death in 2017 that he invented it in 1965. By 1972, Weinberg explained the use of term in &quot;Society and the Healthy Homosexual&quot;. He suggested that those who harbor prejudice against homosexuals, and not homosexuals themselves, are suffering from a psychological malady, an irrational state of mind. Weinberg, though heterosexual himself, became a leader in the (successful) campaign to have homosexuality removed as a diagnostic category from the DSM, the professional therapeutic handbook. He was instrumental in shifting public perception of homosexuality.

Weinberg&#x27;s widely read, seminal 1984 book, &quot;The Heart of Psychotherapy&quot;, described innovative therapeutic methods that de-emphasize traditional therapy&#x27;s approach. He instead presented immediately practical tools that patients can use to help themselves.

==Personal life and death==
Weinberg was married to Dianne Rowe, with whom he collaborated. He died of cancer on March 20, 2017.

<text>The governor of Tennessee is the head of government of the U.S. state of Tennessee.

Tennessee has had 50 governors, including the incumbent, Bill Lee. Seven governors (John Sevier, William Carroll, Andrew Johnson, Robert Love Taylor, Gordon Browning, Frank G. Clement, and Buford Ellington) have served non-consecutive terms. This tally does not include William Blount (the territorial governor) or Robert L. Caruthers (who never took office), though the &quot;Blue Book&quot; includes them in its list of governors. All governors are counted only once, regardless of number of terms served (e.g., John Sevier is considered the 1st governor, rather than the 1st and 3rd governor). The &quot;Blue Book&quot; does not include Edward H. East in its list of governors.

==List of governors==

===Southwest Territory===
The Territory South of the Ohio River, commonly known as the Southwest Territory, was organized on May 26, 1790.

Throughout its 6-year history, Southwest Territory had only one governor appointed by the federal government, William Blount.

===State of Tennessee===
Southwest Territory was admitted to the Union as Tennessee on June 1, 1796.

The first constitution of Tennessee, enacted in 1796, set a term of two years for the governor and provided that no person could serve as governor for more than 6 years in any 8-year period. The term of office was lengthened to four years, without the possibility of consecutive terms, by constitutional amendments adopted in 1953. Under the current provisions of the state constitution, as amended in 1978, the governor is elected to a four-year term and may serve no more than two terms consecutively.

<doc id="215946" wikidata="Q1967005" url="?curid=215946" title="National Coalition for Sexual Freedom">
<text>The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) is an American sex-positive advocacy and educational organization founded in 1997. NCSF has over one hundred coalition partners (consisting of businesses including law firms, mental health professionals, and clubs), and over sixty supporting members (composed of individuals and businesses). NCSF advocates on behalf of adults involved in alternative lifestyles with respect to sexuality and relationship composition, specifically for tolerance and non-discrimination of those so identified, as well as education for adults involved in such lifestyles. The organization&#x27;s main office is in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Founding==
In 1997 the NCSF was founded by Susan Wright, under the auspices of the New York SM Activists. Black Rose, The Eulenspiegel Society, Gay Male S/M Activists, National Leather Association International, and the Society of Janus were its founding coalition partners.

==Mission==
The NCSF&#x27;s mission as described on its web page is:
The NCSF&#x27;s mission has changed since its founding. In 2002 the rights of swingers, polyamorous people, and some other alternative sexuality groups were added to its mission.

On May 14, 2020, the NCSF Board approved its Diversity and Inclusion Vision:NCSF&#x27;s goal is to better fulfill our mission through a better understanding of a diverse range of voices and experiences in our communities. We recognize the similarities and differences between people that make us all unique. We aim to be inclusive by creating opportunities for more people of various backgrounds to be represented and heard by NCSF.

==Programs==
NCSF&#x27;s Education Outreach Program provides education for professionals about the BDSM-Leather-Fetish, Swing and Polyamory communities, information for members of the BDSM-Leather-Fetish, Swing and Polyamory communities concerning consent and legal issues that may affect them, and support in the outreach and education efforts of those communities’ groups, clubs and events to local law enforcement, service agencies and authorities.

The Kink And Poly Aware Professionals Directory, formerly known as the Kink Aware Professionals list (KAP list), has been maintained by the NCSF since January 2006. It is a directory of professionals who have “volunteered to be available to be contacted by people involved in ‘kinky’ sexuality (leather, BDSM, fetish, polyamory, the Lifestyle, etc.)”

NCSF&#x27;s Media Outreach Program provides sound bites and tactics for its advocates and allies in dealing with the media. It also regularly provides media training and conducts interviews.

Consent Counts: In 2006, NCSF was part of a leather leadership roundtable at the Creating Change conference that discussed the goals of the BDSM-leather-fetish communities, particularly the decriminalization of BDSM. A subsequent town hall meeting at the Leather Leadership Conference was held to further discuss this goal and to establish an outline for a working plan. In 2007, NCSF took a leadership role in the Consent Counts project.

NCSF&#x27;s Incident Reporting and Response (IRR) program provides educational resources and referrals to professionals, and tracks the types of requests that are received.

== Research ==
From 2005–2013, NCSF&#x27;s Incident Reporting &amp; Response program collected reports from constituents that the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR paraphilias section was being used in criminal and civil proceedings to informally “diagnose” kink-identified individuals as unable to control their behavior and therefore unfit to retain custody of their children. As a first step in de-pathologizing consensual BDSM, NCSF urged that the APA separate sexual behaviors (paraphilias) from the mental disorders (Paraphilic Disorders). The APA&#x27;s Paraphilias Subworkgroup posted its proposed revisions to the DSM-5 in February 2010, that differentiated consensual paraphilias from paraphilic disorders, and this was largely successful in changing the way BDSM behavior by a parent is considered by family courts during a child custody hearing, typically removing BDSM behavior as a detrimental factor in those cases. As word spread with the publication of the DSM-5 in May 2013, the number of cases reported to NCSF&#x27;s IRR dropped significantly, from 124 parents reporting issues with child custody in 2008 down to 15 parents in 2017.

NCSF&#x27;s 1998 Violence &amp; Discrimination Survey documented incidents of discrimination, harassment, and physical attacks against BDSM-identified individuals and BDSM groups: 36% of the respondents reported suffering some kind of violence or harassment because of their BDSM practices, while 30% reported job discrimination.

NCSF&#x27;s 2015 Psychological Functioning and Violence Victimization and Perpetration survey found that only 9.8% of the 816 respondents stated they are completely open about their involvement in BDSM, while the rest were closeted to varying degrees due to the stigma that is still associated with kink behavior. The majority of participants reported having been victims of violence (26% reported being assaulted while 42% reported being sexually assaulted) but participants themselves were not prone to perpetrating violence, with low rates of aggression proneness, sexual aggression, and endorsement of rape myths. Defined as being a victim of a crime based on actual or perceived BDSM practitioner/kinky status, 7.7% of participants also reported they had been victims of a BDSM-based hate crime.

== Legal ==
&quot;Nitke v. Gonzales:&quot; On December 11, 2001, the NCSF filed a lawsuit in New York City&#x27;s federal court with Barbara Nitke, a New York City artist who has been exploring issues of sexual relationship and desire through photography since 1982. This historic lawsuit against The United States of America challenged the constitutionality of the CDA&#x27;s obscenity statutes on the grounds that they violate the free speech of Internet content providers and inhibit the discussion of sexual issues on the Internet among consenting adults. The attorney for the case is John Wirenius, author of &quot;First Amendment, First Principles: Verbal Acts and Freedom of Speech&quot; (Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc., 2000).

&quot;United States, Appellee v. Miles:&quot; On December 4, 2014, NCSF successfully motioned for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of appellant&#x27;s petition for grant of review in a military case involving a marine who engaged in a consensual threesome and because of that was convicted of adultery, attempted consensual sodomy and indecent conduct, a “crime” based solely on undefined sexual conduct inconsistent with “common propriety.” NCSF argued in its amicus curiae that the conviction of LCpl Miles for attempted consensual sodomy under Article 134, UMCJ, violated his constitutional liberty as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, and that the UMCJ provisions concerning consensual, non-injurious sexual conduct are inconsistent with current sexual mores in American society.

&quot;Woodhull Freedom Foundation et al v. United States:&quot; On February 20, 2019, NCSF joined with allies in filing a Brief in Support of Appellants challenging FOSTA, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017.

==Awards==
In 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2010, NCSF received the Large Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

<text>The sea ducks (Mergini) are a tribe of the duck subfamily of birds, the Anatinae. The taxonomy of this group is incomplete. Some authorities separate the group as a subfamily, while others remove some genera. Most species within the group spend their winters near coastal waters. Many species have developed specialized salt glands to allow them to tolerate salt water, but these are poorly developed in juveniles. Some of the species prefer riverine habitats. All but two of the 22 species in this group live in far northern latitudes.

The fish-eating members of this group, such as the mergansers and smew, have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey and are often known as &quot;sawbills&quot;. Other sea ducks forage by diving underwater, taking molluscs or crustaceans from the sea floor. The Mergini take on the eclipse plumage during the late summer and molt into their breeding plumage during the winter.

==Species==
There are twenty-two species in ten genera:

Below is a phylogeny based on a mitogenomic study of the placement of the Labrador duck and the diving &quot;goose&quot; &quot;Chendytes lawi&quot;.

<text>Daniel Kirkwood &quot;Kirk&quot; Fordice Jr. (; February 10, 1934 – September 7, 2004) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 61st governor of Mississippi from 1992 to 2000. He was the first Republican governor of the state since Reconstruction, and the state&#x27;s first governor elected to two consecutive four-year terms (following a 1987 amendment to the state constitution).

Fordice was a staunch conservative, running on a pro-business, anti-crime, low-tax, &quot;family values&quot; platform. He first ran for governor in 1991, championing various conservative causes, and received 51 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic incumbent Ray Mabus. He was reelected in 1995, and served until his term expired in 2000.

== Early life ==
Daniel Kirkwood Fordice Jr. was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on February 10, 1934. He studied civil engineering at Purdue University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s in 1956 and 1957, respectively. After graduation he served with the United States Army for two years. He remained in the Army Reserve until 1977, retiring with the rank of colonel.

Fordice eventually took control of his father&#x27;s firm, Fordice Construction Company. In the 1960s he created a building division for the company, focusing on industrial structures, and in the 1980 he created a bridge division. Fordice&#x27;s reliance on federal government contracts led him to involve himself in several construction trade groups. In 1974 he joined the executive committee of the Associated General Contractors of America. Holding various leadership positions in the group form 1988 to 1991 (serving the last two years as its president), he acted as a strong proponent of the construction industry and testified several times before U.S. congressional committees. He led the organization through several involved lawsuits aimed at ending minority and small business set-aside requirements for contracting, including &quot;City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.&quot;. His activity in the trade groups increased his interest in politics.

== Political career ==

Fordice joined the Republican Party during Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. He chaired the Warren County organizations for Gil Carmichael&#x27;s gubernatorial campaigns in the 1970s. In 1982 he was elected secretary of the Mississippi Republican Party and convinced the Associated General Contractors to publicly support Republican Haley Barbour in that year&#x27;s United States Senate election in Mississippi.

In 1991 State Auditor Pete Johnson, a former Democrat, entered the 1991 Republican gubernatorial primary. He was challenged by Fordice and another candidate. While Johnson was treated as the frontrunner for much of the campaign, Fordice gradually built a skilled political organization. He characterized Johnson as a &quot;professional politician&quot;. Fordice led in the first primary and defeated Johnson in an October runoff, taking 31,753 votes to Johnson&#x27;s 20,622 votes. While he approached Republican leaders who had embraced Johnson early on with some suspicion, the party rallied around him for the general election.

In the general election Fordice faced Democratic incumbent Ray Mabus. Fordice declared his support for legislative term limits and welfare reform. He labeled Mabus a &quot;Kennedyesque liberal&quot; who focused too much on education and criticized his deficit spending. Republican-hosted focus groups found the governor to be &quot;aloof&quot; and unconcerned with the necessities of &quot;average&quot; Mississippians. Mabus continued to advocate support for public education and attack Fordice as a lobbyist and outside who did not appreciate the needs of the state. Later in the campaign, race became an issue, as Fordice declared his support for workfare and ending racial quotas. Mabus aired a series of television ads which accused Fordice of planning to shut down the state&#x27;s historically black schools.

The governor spent twice as much as his opponent and held an edge in polls up to the election, but many potential voters identified themselves as undecided. On November 5, Fordice won with 50.8 percent to Mabus&#x27; 47.6 percent, the first Republican victory in a Mississippi gubernatorial race since 1874. Having received six percent less of the total vote share than in 1987, several observers blamed Mabus&#x27; loss on perception that he was an arrogant leader. Turnout among black voters was also lower in 1991, and some national Democrats accused Fordice of using race-baiting tactics. He was inaugurated as governor on January 14, 1992.

He vetoed the Education Enhancement Act of 1992, arguing that it was tantamount to a tax increase, but the legislature overrode his veto.

Fordice was re-elected in 1995 against Democratic Mississippi Secretary of State Dick Molpus. His second inauguration was on January 16, 1996. An outspoken conservative, Fordice advocated tax cuts, the abolishment of affirmative action, reductions in the welfare system, expanded capital punishment, tougher prison conditions and the building of more prisons. He was injured in a car wreck on November 5, and Lieutenant Governor Ronnie Musgrove served as acting governor from November 7 to December 17 while Fordice recovered in a hospital.

Fordice offended Jewish groups such as B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith by referring to America as &quot;a Christian Nation&quot; during a Republican governors conference. South Carolina governor Carroll Campbell quickly offered a correction, adding &quot;Judeo-&quot; as a prefix to Christian, but Fordice snapped back that he meant what he said. He later apologized for any offense. Fordice refused to discuss any increase in public school pay rates across the state, even though Mississippi ranked 49th in the nation. When teachers discussed striking he ordered that any teacher who went on strike be immediately fired.

In August 1996, Fordice signed an executive order banning recognition of same-sex marriages in Mississippi. Lawmakers said then that they would back up the executive order with a law. In 2004, Mississippi voters passed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman and further banning recognition of same-sex marriages from other states and countries. Both acts were declared unconstitutional by the 2015 &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; decision from the Supreme Court of the United States.

Fordice said he would have quit his position of Governor while still in office, except that he did not want to give the Democratic candidate, Musgrove, any spot-light time of running the state before the actual election. He left office on January 11, 2000.

==Personal life==

===Extramarital affair===
Fordice&#x27;s tenure was roiled by an extramarital affair with his high school sweetheart Ann G. Creson, which led to his divorce from his wife of forty-four years, Pat Fordice. After leaving office, Fordice married Ann, but they later divorced.

Fordice received much scorn when he suddenly announced that he had &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; with his wife in 1993; she claimed that she had no intention of getting a divorce, and they remained together. Additionally, in 1996, he was photographed eating lunch with a middle-aged woman. These two scandals were soon overshadowed by Fordice&#x27;s other actions, and he came to national attention for supporting the impeachment of then-president Bill Clinton on moral grounds. In June 1999, the media reported Fordice&#x27;s long-running extramarital affair with his high school sweetheart, Ann Creson, who had recently been widowed; they were photographed returning from a vacation together, and journalists reported that Fordice and Creson kissed and massaged each other&#x27;s shoulders. Outside the governor&#x27;s private home in Madison, Fordice responded to WLBT reporter Bert Case asking questions in his news car by threatening to &quot;whip your ass&quot;.

Later that year, he announced that he was divorcing his wife of 44 years and the mother of his four children. In the divorce petition, Fordice claimed that he and his wife had been estranged for three years, even though they both lived in the Governor&#x27;s mansion, and that he planned to marry Creson as soon as the divorce was finalized. Pat Fordice condemned her husband&#x27;s actions, issuing a formal statement reading &quot;it is not fair for Governor Fordice to call upon her to calm the storms by making or adopting public announcements which run contrary to her true feelings ... [Pat Fordice] apologizes to the people of this state for being a partner in a marriage that has become a source of embarrassment for Mississippi.&quot;

Just days after the divorce was finalized in early 2000, Fordice married Creson; they divorced in 2003. Fordice died in 2004, surrounded by his children and former wife; the two are interred beside each other with their own individual grave markers.

===Retirement years and death===
After retiring, Fordice settled in Madison, Mississippi. He died from leukemia in Jackson on September 7, 2004, at age 70. Kirk and Pat Fordice, who reconciled shortly before his death, are interred with a double marker at Parkway Memorial Cemetery in Ridgeland.

<doc id="215956" wikidata="Q723896" url="?curid=215956" title="Thad Cochran">
<text>William Thad Cochran ( ; December 7, 1937 – May 30, 2019) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator for Mississippi from 1978 to 2018. A Republican, he previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973 to 1978.

Born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, Cochran graduated from the University of Mississippi. He served in the United States Navy as an ensign (1959–1961) before graduating from the University of Mississippi School of Law. After practicing law for several years in Jackson, Mississippi, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. He served three terms in the House representing Jackson and portions of southwest Mississippi.

Cochran won a three-way race for U.S. Senate in 1978, becoming the first Republican to win a United States Senate election in Mississippi since Blanche Bruce was elected during Reconstruction. He was re-elected to six terms by wide margins. He was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2015 to 2018. He also chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2003 to 2005. With over 45 years of combined House and Senate service, Cochran is the second longest-serving member of Congress ever from Mississippi, only after former Democratic U.S. Representative Jamie L. Whitten.

Cochran resigned from the Senate due to health issues in April 2018. Cochran died on May 30, 2019 in Oxford, Mississippi.

==Early life==
William Thad Cochran was born on December 7, 1937, in Pontotoc, Mississippi, the son of Emma Grace (née Berry) and William Holmes Cochran, a teacher and school principal, respectively. His family settled in Hinds County, Mississippi, home of the state capital, Jackson, in 1946 after a few moves around the northern part of the state. He graduated valedictorian from Byram High School near Jackson.

Cochran then received a B.A. degree from the University of Mississippi with a major in psychology and a minor in political science in 1959. There he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and was on the cheerleading squad (fellow senator Trent Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader). He was elected to the Phi Kappa Phi honor society, and worked as a lifeguard at Livingston Lake in Jackson during the summers.

After a time in the United States Navy (1959–1961), where he was commissioned an ensign aboard the , Cochran received a J.D. degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1965. While in law school, he won the Frederick Hamel Memorial Award for having the highest scholastic average in the first year class and served on the editorial board of the &quot;Mississippi Law Journal&quot;. Following graduation, Cochran practiced law at the firm of Watkins &amp; Eager in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was promoted to partner.

In 1968, Lamar Alexander recruited Cochran to serve as chairman of Citizens for Nixon-Agnew in Mississippi.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1972, Jackson lawyer Mike Allred and oilman Billy Mounger, both Republicans, recruited Cochran to run for Congress as a Republican. That year, Democratic Congressman Charles H. Griffin of decided not to run for a third full term. Cochran won the Republican nomination for the Jackson-based district, which was renumbered as the 4th District after redistricting. He defeated Democratic state senator Ellis B. Bodron by 47.9% to 44%. One factor in Cochran&#x27;s victory was Richard Nixon&#x27;s strong showing in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Mississippi was Nixon&#x27;s best state in 1972, taking 78.2 percent of the statewide popular vote. Another Republican candidate that year, Gil Carmichael, who ran for U.S. Senate against James Eastland, only finished with 38 percent of the vote, largely because of Nixon steadfastly backing Eastland. Another factor for Cochran&#x27;s win was black turnout. Eddie McBride, a black independent candidate pulled enough black voters from Bodron to help sway the election. McBride has been recruited by Fayette Mayor Charles Evers to retaliate against Bodron who had blocked Evers&#x27; initiative to build a nursing home in Fayette. Cochran, alongside Trent Lott, became the second and third Republicans to be elected to represent Mississippi in the House of Representatives since Reconstruction.

In the 1974 elections, Cochran won in a landslide victory with 70.2 percent of the vote, winning every county besides black-majority Claiborne and Jefferson. He called his victory an endorsement of &quot;my views on cutting down inflation and unnecessary spending.&quot; Cochran ran for reelection in the 1976 elections and was predicted to easily win. Cochran easily won reelection with 76% of the vote.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

In 1978, six-term Democratic Senator James Eastland decided to retire. Cochran ran for the seat and won the Republican primary, defeating state senator and former Jones County prosecutor Charles W. Pickering, 69%–31% percent. In the general election, he faced Democrat Maurice Dantin, a former district attorney who had triumphed in a four-way primary with the backing of Eastland, and Independent candidate Charles Evers, the mayor of Fayette. Evers, the first African American to be elected mayor of a Mississippi town since Reconstruction, split the Democratic vote and Cochran won with a plurality, taking 45.3% to Dantin&#x27;s 31.8% and Evers&#x27; 22.6%. This made Cochran the first Republican to win a statewide election in Mississippi in a century and thus became Mississippi&#x27;s first new U.S. senator since John C. Stennis in 1947. Eastland resigned on 27 December to give Cochran a seniority advantage over other new incoming U.S. senators. Governor Cliff Finch appointed Cochran to serve the remaining week of Eastland&#x27;s term.

Cochran faced an expected strong challenge for re-election from incumbent Democratic governor William Winter in 1984, but he was re-elected easily, 60.9 to 39.1 percent. He was likely helped by the presence of Ronald Reagan atop the ticket for president; Reagan carried Mississippi by an almost identical margin, 61.8 percent to Walter Mondale&#x27;s 37.4 percent.

He was completely unopposed in 1990 and took 71 percent of the vote in 1996; the Democratic nominee, retired factory worker Bootie Hunt, received 27.4 percent. No Democrat ran against Cochran in 2002; he faced only Reform Party candidate Shawn O&#x27;Hara, beating him by 84.6 to 15.4 percent. Cochran faced his strongest challenger in twenty-four years in 2008 when the Democrats nominated State Representative Erik R. Fleming. In a year that saw widespread Democratic gains, Cochran was still re-elected, 61.4–37.6 percent.

====2014 election====

In 2014, Cochran faced a primary challenge from Tea Party-supported candidate Chris McDaniel. Although the primary was initially considered uncompetitive, McDaniel proved a serious challenger. Polling showed the lead swinging between the two and it eventually became a &quot;50%-50% race&quot;.

The primary was considered a marquee establishment-versus-Tea Party fight. Cochran&#x27;s seniority and appropriating skills contrasted with the junior status of the rest of the state&#x27;s congressional delegation. The primary was described as &quot;nasty&quot; and full of &quot;bizarre&quot; twists.

In May 2014, a scandal emerged when a McDaniel supporter allegedly entered a nursing home where Cochran&#x27;s bedridden wife was living and took pictures of her. The images were posted to a blog, intending to advance the rumor that Cochran was having affairs while his wife was receiving care. Four people were arrested in connection with the incident. The connection to the McDaniel campaign was disputed. One of the arrested included McDaniel ally Mark Mayfield, who was vice chairman of the state&#x27;s Tea Party. In response, McDaniel said, &quot;the violation of the privacy of Mrs. Cochran [was] out of bounds for politics and reprehensible.&quot;

Neither candidate won a majority in the primary election; McDaniel won 49.46% of the vote, while Cochran received 49.02%. A runoff election between McDaniel and Cochran was held on June 24. Despite trailing in most of the polls, Cochran won with 51.01% of the vote to McDaniel&#x27;s 48.99%. The Cochran campaign denied allegations of vote-buying made by a blogger regarding his run-off victory. In the aftermath of the runoff, the McDaniel campaign claimed there were indications of voter fraud. McDaniel&#x27;s legal challenge to the election results failed.

On Election Day, Cochran defeated Democratic former U.S. Rep. Travis Childers, 59.90%-37.89%.

===Tenure===

Generally, Cochran kept a lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest for someone who spent almost half a century in Washington, including seven terms in the Senate. However, he had considerable influence behind the scenes, especially in Mississippi.

In March 1981, after the Senate Agriculture Committee overwhelmingly approved a proposal to enact a temporary freeze on the level of dairy price supports and thereby gave President Ronald Reagan his first congressional victory for his federal spending reductions, Cochran stated that the vote was &quot;a great victory for&quot; Reagan and &quot;a very important first step in having his program adopted by Congress.&quot;

In April 1981, along with Bob Packwood, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John Heinz, David Pryor, Spark M. Matsunaga, Donald W. Riegle Jr., and Bill Bradley, Cochran was one of eight senators to cosponsor a bipartisan six-year experiment in care at home for the elderly and disabled for the purpose of presenting an alternative to expensive hospitals and nursing facilities.

Cochran served as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1985 to 1991 and as Chairman from 1991 to 1996. He chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2003 to 2005. In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, making him the first Republican from a former Confederate state to chair the committee. While Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Cochran worked to expedite the process of approving spending bills to minimize partisan skirmishing.

In June 1991, Cochran introduced legislation to establish a commission of three members appointed by the president to oversee recognition of Indian tribes and speed the tribal recognition process. Cochran said he was &quot;supportive of trying to establish a procedure that would permit these matters to be resolved by a commission&quot; and that it was a better alternative to seeking to &quot;call on Congress to make decisions we&#x27;re really not qualified to make.&quot;

In June 1996, Cochran ran for the post of Senate Majority Leader to succeed Republican Bob Dole, who had resigned from the Senate to concentrate on his presidential campaign. Cochran faced his Mississippi colleague Trent Lott, the then-Senate Majority Whip. Cochran cast himself as an &quot;institutionalist&quot; and who would held to rebuild public trust in Congress through compromise over conflict. Lott promised a &quot;more aggressive&quot; style of leadership and courted the younger Senate conservatives. Cochran lost by 44 votes to 8.
On June 13, 2005, the U.S. Senate formally apologized for its failure to enact a federal anti-lynching law in the early 20th century, &quot;when it was most needed&quot;. The resolution was passed on a voice vote with 80 senators cosponsoring. Cochran and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott were among the 20 senators who did not join as cosponsors. Cochran said, &quot;I&#x27;m not in the business of apologizing for what someone else did or didn&#x27;t do. I deplore and regret that lynching occurred and that those committing them weren&#x27;t punished, but I&#x27;m not culpable&quot;.

In April 2006, Cochran was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;. He was dubbed &quot;The Quiet Persuader&quot; for his role in winning money for the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. &quot;Time&quot; reported that Cochran managed to wring &quot;$29 billion out of his colleagues, almost double the money [President George W.] Bush and congressional leaders had initially pledged&quot;. Earlier, Cochran threatened to derail a defense appropriations bill unless it included funding for installations on the Gulf Coast. The article also noted that Cochran has &quot;gained the trust of the [Bush] Administration and Capitol Hill for his quiet, courtly manner... using his experience and mastery of the issues to persuade his colleagues privately rather than making demands on them in public&quot;. The magazine quoted an unnamed &quot;senior GOP Senator&quot; who said &quot;He doesn&#x27;t get a whole lot of play in terms of coverage, but he is effectively stubborn doing what needs to be done.&quot;

In late 2017, questions began to arise over Cochran&#x27;s apparently deteriorating health. He missed two weeks of the Senate session due to a urological procedure. Upon his return to Washington, Cochran needed assistance locating the Senate chamber and was described by &quot;Politico&quot; as &quot;frail&quot; and &quot;disoriented&quot;. On one occasion, he repeatedly voted &quot;yes&quot; despite being told by aides to vote &quot;no&quot;; he later realized his mistake and changed his vote. However, Cochran sought to defuse rumors that his retirement was imminent, saying, &quot;Don’t believe everything you hear&quot;.

On March 5, 2018, Cochran announced that he would retire from the Senate due to ongoing health challenges. Cochran left office on April 1, 2018. He was one of the longest-serving members of Congress in history.

===Positions===

Cochran was considered to be more moderate than his Republican colleagues. In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; arranged Republican senators based on ideology and reported that Cochran was the fourth most moderate Republican in their findings. According to GovTrack, Cochran was more moderate than most of his Republican colleagues being to the left of most but to the right of several others. The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Senator Cochran a composite ideology score of 68% conservative and 33% liberal.

In 2005, he was one of nine senators who voted against the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which prohibited &quot;inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay&quot;. The others, all Republicans, were Wayne Allard, Kit Bond, Tom Coburn, Jeff Sessions, Jim Inhofe, Pat Roberts, John Cornyn and Ted Stevens.

On July 18, 2006, Cochran voted, along with 19 Republican senators, for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to lift restrictions on federal funding for the research.

In April 2010, it was reported that Cochran finished at the top of the Citizens Against Government Waste&#x27;s list of congressional earmarks, having requested a total of $490 million in earmarks.

In 2012, Cochran encouraged Mississippians to prepare for the effects of Tropical Storm Isaac, saying &quot;Taking steps now to protect people and property should help lessen the losses that might be associated with Isaac. It is important that everyone stay informed and follow emergency orders. I am confident that Mississippians have learned valuable lessons from previous storms and will work together to prepare for this newest threat, I believe Governor Bryant and others are handling emergency preparedness actions very well.&quot;

==== Environment ====
In 2017, Cochran was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Cochran had received more than $290,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.

==== Gun law ====

Cochran had an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) due to his consistent voting and support of pro-gun legislation. The NRA endorsed Cochran in the 2014 election.

In April 2013, Cochran was one of forty-six senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for gun buyers. Cochran voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.

Cochran voted to repeal a regulation that made it illegal for certain individuals with specific mental health diagnosis to purchase guns. The original law authorizing such regulation was passed with a unanimous vote in 2007 after the Virginia Tech shooting. Cochran claims the law infringed upon the Second Amendment rights of disabled people.

==== Healthcare ====
Cochran opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

==== Jefferson Davis ====
As senior senator of the state of Mississippi, Cochran was given the opportunity to use the desk of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, which Cochran accepted. Cochran said that he was &quot;very proud&quot; to have Davis&#x27;s desk. Cochran opposed attempts to remove a statue of Davis from the U.S. Capitol.

==== Martin Luther King Jr. Day ====
In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed into law: H.R. 3706 (98th) – A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to make the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., a legal public holiday. Cochran, a Republican, voted for the act. His colleague in the Senate from Mississippi, Democrat John C. Stennis, voted against the act.

==== Trade ====
In January 2018, Cochran was one of thirty-six Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement by modernizing it for the economy of the 21st century.

===Staff===

*Mississippi State University president Mark Keenum served as Cochran&#x27;s chief-of-staff.
*Delta State University president William LaForge served as Cochran&#x27;s chief-of-staff.
* In 1973, Cochran hired Nehemiah Flowers Jr. from WLBT, where he was Mississippi&#x27;s first black television executive. Flowers was the first African-American congressional staffer in Mississippi since Reconstruction. Flowers remained on Cochran&#x27;s staff until 2002, when Cochran recommended him and President George W. Bush nominated him to become U.S. Marshal for Mississippi&#x27;s Southern District. He remained in that position until 2010.
*AT&amp;T Mississippi president R. Mayo Flint III formerly served on Cochran&#x27;s staff.

===Sponsored legislation===
*The Natchez Trace Parkway Land Conveyance Act of 2013 (S. 304; 113th Congress) () is a bill that was sponsored and actively lobbied for by Thad Cochran during the 113th United States Congress. The bill would require the National Park Service (NPS) to convey about 67 acres of property in the Natchez Trace Parkway to the state of Mississippi. The legislation also would adjust the boundaries of the parkway to include 10 additional acres. The two pieces of land in question originally belonged to Mississippi, and were donated to the National Park Service when the NPS was trying to determine where to end the Natchez Trace Parkway. Since the NPS did not choose to use either of the pieces of land, the state would like the land back.
*The Bipartisan Sportsmen&#x27;s Act of 2014 (S. 2363; 113th Congress), a bill related to hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation in the United States, aimed at improving &quot;the public&#x27;s ability to enjoy the outdoors.&quot; Cochran supported the bill, arguing that the bill &quot;deserves broad support for its policies and reforms that will protect and enhance opportunities to hunt, fish and enjoy the outdoors.&quot; 
*Cochran was the lead sponsor of &quot;The Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense Act of 1999.&quot; The policy sought to counter emerging missile threats from China, North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. The policy was enacted into law on July 22, 1999, as incorporated into a House version of the bill. The act stated: It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate) with funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for National Missile Defense.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which was signed into law on March 23, 2018, named the federal courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi after Cochran. The courthouse-naming provision of the act was included by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who served as the ranking Democrat on the committee and considered Cochran his closest friend in the Senate. On August 9, 2018, a ceremony was held to recognize the naming of the Thad Cochran United States Courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi.

<text>The smew (Mergellus albellus) is a species of duck and is the only living member of the genus Mergellus. &quot;Mergellus&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;Mergus&quot; and &quot;albellus&quot; is from Latin &quot;albus&quot; &quot;white&quot;. This genus is closely related to &quot;Mergus&quot; and is sometimes included in it, though it might be closer to the goldeneyes (&quot;Bucephala&quot;). The smew has hybridized with the common goldeneye (&quot;B. clangula&quot;).

A seaduck fossil from the Middle Miocene shows that birds similar to smew existed up to 13 million years ago. The extant species dates back to the Late Pleistocene.

==Etymology==
The smew was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Mergus albellus&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the description published in 1757 by another Swedish naturalist, Fredrik Hasselqvist. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this was restricted to the Mediterranean near İzmir in Turkey. The smew is now the only living species placed in the genus &quot;Mergellus&quot; that was introduced in 1840 by the English naturalist Prideaux Selby. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is the Latin word for an unknown seabird, perhaps a cormorant. The specific epithet &quot;albellus&quot; is a Latin diminutive of &quot;albus&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot;.

The term &quot;smew&quot; has been used since the 17th century and is of uncertain origin. It is believed to be related to the Dutch &quot;smient&quot; (&quot;wigeon&quot;) and the German &quot;Schmeiente&quot; or &quot; Schmünte&quot;, &quot;wild duck.&quot; It is probably derived from &quot;smee&quot;, a dialectal term for a wild duck.

==Description==

The drake smew, with its &#x27;cracked ice&#x27; or &#x27;panda&#x27; appearance, is unmistakable, and looks very black-and-white in flight. The females and immature males are grey birds with chestnut foreheads and crowns, and can be confused at a distance with the ruddy duck; they are often known as &quot;redhead&quot; smew. It has oval white wing-patches in flight. The smew&#x27;s bill has a hooked tip and serrated edges, which help it catch fish when it dives for them.

The smew is long, with a wingspan of 56–69 cm, and a weight 450–650 g.

==Distribution and ecology==

This species breeds in the northern taiga of Europe and the Palearctic. It needs trees for breeding. The smew lives on fish-rich lakes and slow rivers. As a migrant, it leaves its breeding areas and winters on sheltered coasts or inland lakes of the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, northern Germany and the Low Countries, with a small number reaching Great Britain (for example, at Dungeness), mostly at regular sites. Vagrants have been recorded in North America. On lakes it prefers areas around the edges, often under small trees. The smew breeds in May and lays 7–11 cream-colored eggs, incubated by the female for 26–28 days. Ducklings leave the nest soon after hatching and learn to fly within about 10 weeks.

It nests in tree holes, such as old woodpecker nests. It is a shy bird and flushes easily when disturbed.

The smew is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. It is not considered threatened on the IUCN Red List, though its population is decreasing.

==Fossil history==
An unnamed fossil seaduck, known from a humerus found in the Middle Miocene Sajóvölgyi Formation (Late Badenian, 13–12 million years ago) of Mátraszõlõs, Hungary, was assigned to &quot;Mergus&quot;. However, the authors included the smew therein, and consequently, the bone is more properly assigned to &quot;Mergellus&quot;—especially as it was more similar to a smew&#x27;s than to the &quot;Bucephala&quot; remains also found at the site. It is sometimes argued that the Mátraszõlõs fossil is too old to represent any of the modern seaduck genera, but apparently these were all well-distinct even back then.

Subfossils from this species was also found in England indicate that the living species&#x27; range extended there a few thousand years ago.

<text>Amar&#x27;e Carsares Jehoshaphat Stoudemire (born November 16, 1982) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who most recently served as a player development assistant for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 2003 with the Phoenix Suns, who selected him with the ninth overall pick of the 2002 NBA draft. He made six appearances in the NBA All-Star Game and was named to the All-NBA Team five times, including one first-team selection in 2007. Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire was inducted into Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor on March 2, 2024.

Stoudemire played high school basketball for three schools, ultimately graduating from Cypress Creek High School in Orlando, Florida, and declaring for the NBA draft as a prep-to-pro player. He won several prep honors, including being selected as Florida&#x27;s Mr. Basketball. Stoudemire had chronic knee problems during his career and underwent microfracture surgery on both knees. He played for the Suns, the New York Knicks, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Miami Heat before retiring from the NBA in 2016.

Stoudemire won a bronze medal with the United States national team at the 2004 Olympic Games. His off-court ventures include a record label, a clothing line, acting and a series of children&#x27;s books for Scholastic Press. In addition, Stoudemire owns a significant share of Hapoel Jerusalem, the team he won a championship with in 2017. He won the championship with Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2020 and was named the Israeli Basketball Premier League Finals MVP.

==Early life==
Stoudemire was born in Lake Wales, Florida, a small city, an hour away from Orlando, Florida. Stoudemire&#x27;s parents, Hazell and Carrie (née Palmorn), divorced when he was young. Together they had two sons and a daughter : Hazell Jr., Ladesha, and Amar&#x27;e. Stoudemire&#x27;s mother did agricultural work, picking oranges in Florida and migrating north to upstate New York to pick apples during the fall. Upon divorcing Hazell, she met Artis Wilmore, with whom she had a son, Marwan, Stoudemire&#x27;s half-brother. His father died of a heart attack when Stoudemire was 12, and his mother was in and out of prison for crimes such as petty theft and forgery during that time. Stoudemire lived in Newburgh, New York &quot;for about five months&quot; in 1994 before relocating to Port Jervis, New York where he lived until 1998. In his parents&#x27; absence, Stoudemire had other outside influences to help guide him, including a policeman, Burney Hayes, he occasionally stayed with; he also lived with his Fastbreak USA, AAU squad&#x27;s coach, Travis King, as well as a minister, Rev. Bill Williams.

==High school career==
Stoudemire did not start playing organized basketball until he was 14. As a result of moving in-and-out with his mother and her problems with the law, Stoudemire transferred between five high schools in two states six different times. He first attended Lake Wales High School in Lake Wales, Florida, where his freshman season was cut short due to academic ineligibility. He transferred to Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, to play for coach Joel Hopkins. Midway through the year, Hopkins founded Emmanuel Christian Academy in a Durham office building basement and took the Mount Zion basketball team to serve as his student body; the school folded before they played a game. Stoudemire returned to Florida where he attended summer school at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando. He briefly reenrolled at Mount Zion Academy and then sat out a year at West Orange High School in Winter Garden, Florida, due to academic ineligibility that stemmed from his transcripts from Mount Zion. His final move was to Cypress Creek High School in Orlando, Florida, where he graduated in 2002. Due to all the transfers, he missed his entire junior year of basketball and only played two full seasons.

Apart from basketball, Stoudemire excelled in football. He was coached by his father in Pop Warner football and imagined himself a star receiver for the University of Miami, University of Florida or Florida State University. Growing up he rooted for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, center for the hometown Orlando Magic of the NBA.

In his senior year, Stoudemire averaged 29.1 points, 15 rebounds, 6.1 blocked shots, and 2.1 steals per game. Among Stoudemire&#x27;s high school honors was being selected to play in the 2002 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where he played with two future New York Knicks teammates, Carmelo Anthony and Raymond Felton. He was also named Florida&#x27;s Mr. Basketball, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; Florida High School Player of the Year, and to &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA Basketball First Team.

Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Stoudemire was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2002. With his biggest goal in high school being making it to the NBA, Stoudemire committed to the University of Memphis. However, he later de-committed and declared for the NBA draft, being taken with the ninth pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. He was the only high school player taken that year in the first round.

==Professional career==

===Phoenix Suns (2002–2010)===

====2002–03: Rookie of the Year====
In his rookie season, Stoudemire averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, with a season high of 38 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 30, 2002, the highest score by a prep-to-pro player until broken a year later by LeBron James. Stoudemire was selected to the Rookie squad in the Rookie Challenge. In the game, Stoudemire recorded 18 points, 7 rebounds and 4 steals. Stoudemire won the NBA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award, beating out Yao Ming and Caron Butler and becoming the first player drafted out of high school to win the award. Stoudemire also was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. The Suns, led by Stoudemire, Stephon Marbury, Shawn Marion, Penny Hardaway and Joe Johnson, made it to the playoffs but were defeated in six games by the eventual champions, the San Antonio Spurs.

====2003–04: Improving as a sophomore====
During the following season, Stoudemire improved statistically, but his team stumbled to a 29–53 record, and point guard Marbury was traded to the New York Knicks. During the season Stoudemire had a 10-block game against the Utah Jazz; he recorded six blocks in the first quarter alone (both team records as of 2012). During the summer of 2004, Stoudemire was selected to play for the eventual bronze medal-winning 2004 U.S. national team in the Summer Olympics. However, head coach Larry Brown declined to give him significant playing time (6.9 minutes per game).

====2004–05: First All-Star and All-NBA appearances====
During the 2004–05 season, Stoudemire teamed up with point guard Steve Nash whom the Suns signed as a free agent, to lead the Suns to a 62–20 record. Averaging 26 points per game that year and achieving a new career high of 50 points against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 2, 2005, he was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a reserve forward. Stoudemire and Nash ran a pick-and-roll some have compared to Hall of Famers John Stockton and Karl Malone. In the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, Stoudemire averaged 37 points per game, but the Suns still lost in five games.

====2005–06: Knee problems====
During the 2005–06 NBA preseason, knee cartilage damage was discovered and Stoudemire underwent microfracture surgery on October 18, 2005. Initially, the Suns thought he would return by mid-February, but his rehab took longer than expected. Stoudemire, however, scored 20 points in his return against the Portland Trail Blazers, but went scoreless his third game against the New Jersey Nets on March 27, 2006. On March 28 it was announced that he would likely miss the rest of the regular season due to ongoing stiffness in both knees. His manager stated that the comeback came a little too soon, and Stoudemire needed to do more rehab. Stoudemire&#x27;s rehabilitation, which was led by Suns trainer Aaron Nelson and Dr. Micheal Clark, the president and CEO of the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), went well as he stated during the rehab that he was explosive and he gradually gained his strength back.

Stoudemire attended the 2006 USA Basketball camp in Las Vegas, although he ultimately did not play in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.

====2006–07: Comeback and All-NBA First Team selection====
Before the 2006–07 season, Stoudemire changed his jersey number from 32 to 1. Dijon Thompson had worn no. 1 the previous season.

On February 18, 2007, Stoudemire appeared in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his second All-Star Game appearance. He scored 29 points and grabbed 9 rebounds, and came in second in MVP voting to Kobe Bryant. He had previously announced that he would make the all-star game in his first season back after his knee recovered.

During the 2007 playoffs, in a series against the San Antonio Spurs, Stoudemire accused Manu Ginóbili and Bruce Bowen of being &quot;dirty&quot; players. Stoudemire, along with teammate Boris Diaw, was suspended for Game 5 for leaving the bench area after an altercation between teammate Steve Nash and Spurs forward Robert Horry. The Suns lost to the Spurs in six games despite Stoudemire averaging 25 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks throughout the series. He finished the 2006–07 regular season averaging 20.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team.

====2007–10: Eye surgery and playoff defeats====
Stoudemire played in the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, but withdrew from the national team for the 2008 Olympics. Jerry Colangelo, managing director for the national team, said, &quot;Amar&#x27;e has pulled himself out of consideration for the roster and that&#x27;s predicated on, despite the fact that he&#x27;s had an injury-free year coming back, he&#x27;s a little hesitant on pushing the envelope too hard.&quot; Stoudemire had said in April 2008, &quot;It&#x27;s more than a year-round grind. It&#x27;s last year and the year before that and the year before that. It&#x27;s really been like a three-year-round basketball circuit.&quot;

Stoudemire led the Suns in scoring (25.2 per game) and rebounds (9.1 per game) in the 2007–08 season. He made the All-Star team and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. Stoudemire also adjusted well to playing with veteran center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who the Suns had acquired in February. The Suns, however, faltered in the playoffs, again losing to their rivals the San Antonio Spurs. The Suns blew a big lead in game one of the series, and seemed to never recover, losing the series 4–1 to the Spurs. Stoudemire averaged 23 points in the series. After the season, Suns head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni left the team to coach the New York Knicks.

Under new coach Terry Porter, the Suns struggled early in 2008–09 with his system and lost five games in a row heading into the 2009 All-Star break. Stoudemire was voted a starter for the Western Conference. On February 19, in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, Stoudemire suffered a detached retina, although he may have injured it earlier as he had been bothered by the same eye even before this game. He had injured the same eye in preseason, although this injury involved a partially torn iris, with no damage to his retina. He said then that he would have to wear protective goggles for the rest of his career, but stopped wearing them after seven games. Stoudemire underwent eye surgery to repair the retina. The recovery took eight weeks, which forced him to miss the remainder of the regular season. He announced that he would wear protective goggles when he returned to play the following season.

In the 2009–10 season, Stoudemire was once again named to the All-Star team. During the season, Paul Coro of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; reported that the Suns and Cleveland Cavaliers discussed a trade that would have sent Stoudemire to Cleveland to pair up with LeBron James; the deal, however, never went through. Another proposed deal during the 2009 NBA draft would have sent Stoudemire to the Golden State Warriors for a package centered around the #7 overall pick, but the Warriors backed out of the deal at the last minute and selected Stephen Curry with the pick. Stoudemire would eventually lead the Suns to a 54–28 record, clinching the third seed in the Western Conference. Stoudemire finished the season averaging 23 points and 9 rebounds on 56% shooting. The Suns would defeat the Portland Trail Blazers 4–2 during the first round of the playoffs and beat the San Antonio Spurs 4–0 in the Conference Semifinals, to meet the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals. After dropping the first two games, Stoudemire would score 42 points in game 3 and 21 in game 4, to help the Suns tie the series 2–2. The Suns failed to win any additional games in the series, dropping it 4–2.

Stoudemire finished his tenure with the Suns fourth in franchise history in scoring average (21.4 points per game), third in rebounds, free throws made and attempted, fifth in blocked shots, and single-game records of consecutive free throws in one game (20) and blocked shots (10).

===New York Knicks (2010–2015)===

====2010–11: First season in New York====
On June 30, 2010, Stoudemire opted out of his contract with the Phoenix Suns, which made him an unrestricted free agent. On July 5, 2010, Stoudemire and the New York Knicks agreed in principle to a contract estimated to be worth around $99.7 million over five years. On the first day that free agents were allowed to officially sign, the Knicks formally introduced Stoudemire at Madison Square Garden. There Stoudemire proclaimed &quot;the Knicks are back!&quot; referring to the team&#x27;s lack of success the past few years. With the Knicks, Stoudemire was reunited with head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni, who had coached him with the Suns. On December 15, 2010, in a loss against the Boston Celtics, Stoudemire set a franchise record with his ninth straight 30-point game. On December 17, 2010, Stoudemire set a franchise record with his ninth straight game shooting 50 percent or better from the field. On January 27, 2011, Stoudemire was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team alongside LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, and Dwight Howard. He became the first Knicks player to start in the game since Patrick Ewing. In the game Stoudemire scored 29 points, which tied him with LeBron James for most on the Eastern Conference team. On February 22, 2011, the Knicks made a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves that sent Nuggets superstar Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks along with the Nuggets&#x27; starting point guard Chauncey Billups. In 2011, the Knicks made the playoffs for the first time since 2004. Stoudemire was injured during the playoffs. In game 3, Stoudemire attempted a Willis Reed-like comeback by playing in the game despite a bad back. In the first round of the playoffs, the Knicks were swept by the Boston Celtics. Stoudemire ended up having one of the best seasons in his career, averaging 25.3 points, 9.1 rebounds, a career-high 2.6 assists and 2 blocks per game. Stoudemire developed a mid-range game and shot a career-high 43% from three-point range. Stoudemire was named to the All-NBA Second Team.

====2011–12: Struggles====
During the 2011 NBA lockout, Stoudemire served as a player representative for the Knicks. Stoudemire represented the Knicks along with teammates Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Toney Douglas, and Roger Mason Jr., who was Vice President of the Players Union. Stoudemire considered playing overseas for Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. due to his possible Hebrew heritage, but instead opted to stay with the players union. In October 2011, Stoudemire appeared on ESPN &quot;First Take&quot;, where he promoted his new sneaker line, the Nike Air Max Sweep Thru. During the lockout, Stoudemire trained and took history seminars at Florida International University. He also dabbled in acting, appearing in the second-last episode (&quot;Second to Last&quot;) of &quot;Entourage&quot;.

Before the 2011–12 season, the Knicks acquired Tyson Chandler, but released point guard Chauncey Billups via the amnesty clause. Early on in the season, Stoudemire struggled without a point guard to distribute the basketball. In February 2012, Stoudemire missed four games mourning the death of his older brother, Hazell, who had died in a car accident. Later that month, the Eastern Conference All-Stars were announced; Stoudemire was not voted in, nor selected by the coaches to play in the All-Star Game. It was the first year since 2006 that he was not selected to the All-Star Game. Stoudemire was struggling with efficiency and explosiveness and blamed it on the weight he gained during the NBA lockout and so engaged in a weight loss program, losing 10 pounds in 10 days with a goal to reach 245 pounds. The weight loss proved to be beneficial for Stoudemire, as he averaged 18 points per game on 56% shooting March. After a good March, however, Stoudemire suffered a bulging disk in his back. Stoudemire returned with a few games remaining in the regular season. The seventh-seeded Knicks were paired with the defending Eastern Conference champions in the Miami Heat heading into the Eastern Conference First Round. After a loss in Game 2, Stoudemire suffered from a self-inflicted cut to his left hand after punching a fire extinguisher box in the visitors&#x27; locker room. The wound required stitches to mend. Stoudemire returned for game four and recorded 20 points and 10 rebounds, in a Knicks victory. The victory snapped a record 13 game playoff losing streak for the Knicks. The Knicks would, however, not win another game as they lost the series 4–1 to the Heat. In the Heat&#x27;s series clinching win in game 5, Stoudemire fouled out after the Heat&#x27;s Shane Battier drew an offensive foul; this led to the Heat&#x27;s PA announcer announcing Stoudemire had been extinguished, referring to Stoudemire&#x27;s hand injury. The Heat later issued an apology to Stoudemire. The 2011–2012 season was a disappointment as Stoudemire&#x27;s production dropped off in every statistical category from the prior year. Stoudemire averaged 17.5 points, which was down almost 8 points from the prior year, 7.8 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.0 blocks.

====2012–14: Injury-plagued seasons====
Stoudemire missed the first 30 games of the 2012–13 season with a knee injury. On December 18, 2012, he was assigned to the Erie BayHawks of the NBA D-League so that he could practice with that team as he continued his rehab. He was recalled by the Knicks on December 21. Stoudemire made his season debut on January 1, 2013, at home against Portland, playing 17 minutes off the bench, scoring six points and grabbing one rebound. After returning Stoudemire was restricted to playing a maximum of 30 minutes a game.

It was announced on March 9, 2013, that Stoudemire would have a right knee debridement. He missed the rest of the regular season because of that. For the first time in his career, he was not a starter, but a sixth man for the New York Knicks. He only played 29 games during the season, averaging 14.2 points per game and 5 rebounds per game in 23.5 minutes per game. Even without him for most of the time, the Knicks finished 54–28 (second-best in the Eastern Conference), made the playoffs for the third time in a row, and won their first Atlantic Division title since the 1993–94 season. Stoudemire was still out when the New York Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in six games which would be the Knicks&#x27; first playoff victory since 2000. He returned to action on May 11, 2013, in Game 3 during the Knicks&#x27; Eastern Conference Semifinals series against the Indiana Pacers. The Knicks ended up losing to the Pacers in 6 games.

After injuries limited him to 47 and 29 games played in the previous two seasons, respectively, Stoudemire bounced back for the Knicks in the 2013–14 season. Not only did he manage to play in 65 games, but he grew stronger as the year progressed. He maintained his offensive efficiency as his workload increased, ultimately forcing his way into the starting five for good on March 3 in Detroit. Once there, he led New York to seven straight wins in games in which he played. In 14 games in March, he averaged 16.9 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, while averaging 28.3 minutes as he proved capable of playing power forward alongside Tyson Chandler or center in small lineups.

With the Knicks&#x27; playoff hopes hanging on by a thread with a week to go in the regular season, Stoudemire put together arguably his best performance of the season, lighting up the division-leading Toronto Raptors for 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting and 11 rebounds. However, despite Stoudemire&#x27;s efforts, the Knicks failed to qualify for the 2014 playoffs, finishing just shy with a 35–47 record and a ninth-place finish in the East.

====2014–15: Final year with Knicks====
Having played predominantly in a bench role for the Knicks in 2013–14, Stoudemire&#x27;s role in 2014–15 began much the same, and with it came solid production as he missed just one game over the first 28. He proved to be a solid leader off the bench for a fledgling Knicks team that had won just five games by mid-December, as he averaged 13.4 points and 7.4 rebounds per game up to and including the December 18 loss to Chicago. He went on to miss the next 12 out of 13 games with another knee injury, returning to action on January 15 in London to face Milwaukee, as he went scoreless in eight first-half minutes and did not play after half time.

On February 16, 2015, Stoudemire was waived by the Knicks after an agreement was reached to buy out his contract.

===Dallas Mavericks (2015)===
On February 18, 2015, Stoudemire signed with the Dallas Mavericks. Four days later, he made his debut for the Mavericks against the Charlotte Hornets and recorded 14 points in just 11 minutes off the bench. Stoudemire went on to play in 23 games for the Mavericks and averaged 10.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.

===Miami Heat (2015–2016)===
On July 10, 2015, Stoudemire signed with the Miami Heat. He played in just one of the Heat&#x27;s first 10 games of the 2015–16 season, largely due to knee soreness. He played eight minutes of first half action against the Sacramento Kings on November 19, scoring 10 points off the bench to spark the Heat early, as the team went on to win the game 116–109. On January 31, 2016, he recorded season highs of 13 points and 12 rebounds against the Atlanta Hawks, starting in place of the injured Hassan Whiteside. Two days later, he set a new season high with 14 points in a loss to the Houston Rockets, starting at center for the Heat in his sixth straight game. Stoudemire&#x27;s final NBA game was played in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Toronto Raptors on May 11, 2016. The Heat lost the game 99–91, with Stoudemire only playing 3 minutes as the Heat&#x27;s starting center, recording one rebound and one steal. The Heat would go on to lose the series in seven games.

On July 26, 2016, Stoudemire signed a contract with the New York Knicks to retire as a Knick, as he announced his retirement from the NBA later that day after 14 seasons in the league.

===Hapoel Jerusalem (2016–2019)===
Though he retired from the NBA, Stoudemire did not retire from playing basketball, and on August 1, 2016, he signed a two-year deal with Hapoel Jerusalem, a team he co-owns in the Israeli Basketball Premier League. On October 1, 2016, he helped Hapoel Jerusalem win the Israeli Basketball League Cup. He went on to earn All-EuroCup Second Team honors for the 2016–17 season, as well as Israeli Basketball Premier League All-Star honors. In June 2017, he helped Hapoel Jerusalem win the 2016–17 Israeli Basketball Super League.

On September 1, 2017, Stoudemire announced his retirement from basketball.

In February 2018, Stoudemire joined BIG3 team Tri State as co-captain. Three months later, Stoudemire announced that he was contemplating a return to playing professional basketball in the NBA.

On September 24, Stoudemire came out of retirement to sign with Hapoel Jerusalem for the 2018–19 season. On October 31, Stoudemire recorded a season-high 24 points, shooting 10-of-16 from the field, along with seven rebounds in a 105–75 win over Montakit Fuenlabrada, and was named to the Champions League&#x27;s Team of the Week. On May 2, 2019, Stoudemire was named Israeli Premier League Player of the Month after averaging 16.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game in four games played in April.

===Fujian Sturgeons (2019)===
On October 30, 2019, Stoudemire signed with the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association. He appeared in 11 games for the Sturgeons, averaging 19.3 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. In mid-December 2019, Stoudemire had left the team to return to the United States.

===Maccabi Tel Aviv (2020)===
On January 22, 2020, Stoudemire returned to Israel for a third stint, signing with Maccabi Tel Aviv for the rest of the season. In July 2020, he helped Maccabi Tel Aviv win the championship while earning Israeli Basketball Premier League Finals MVP honors.

==Coaching career==
On October 30, 2020, Stoudemire was hired by the Brooklyn Nets as a player development assistant. On May 12, 2022, he announced he would not be returning to the Nets for the 2022–23 season.

==Personal life==
Stoudemire has four children with his ex-wife, Alexis Welch. Having dated since 2002, the two were engaged in May 2012 and later married on December 12, 2012, atop their Greenwich Village apartment rooftop. Stoudemire filed for divorce from his wife in October 2018 but the case was dismissed in July 2019 after he failed to submit the required documents to follow through. Two years later Alexis filed for divorce, which was finalized in 2021.

Stoudemire&#x27;s first name had previously been listed in the Phoenix Suns media guide as &quot;Amaré&quot; or &quot;Amare&quot;, but it was changed to &quot;Amar&#x27;e&quot; in October 2008. Stoudemire told NBA.com that his name had always been spelled &quot;Amar&#x27;e&quot;, but the media had been spelling it incorrectly since he joined the NBA.

Stoudemire was raised Baptist. Through his mother, he associated with the Black Hebrew Israelites. In a 2010 interview, he said, &quot;I have been aware since my youth that I am a Hebrew through my mother, and that is something that has played a subtle but important role in my development.&quot; Asked if there was a chance he was Jewish, he said &quot;I think through history, I think we all are.&quot; He visited Israel that year, saying he intended &quot;to get a better understanding of [his] heritage.&quot; He returned for the 2013 Maccabiah Games as assistant coach of the Canadian basketball team; while there he met with Israeli president Shimon Peres, who urged him to join the Israel national basketball team. In April 2018, he reportedly began converting to Judaism. In January 2019, he was granted residency in Israel. In March 2019, he received Israeli citizenship, and adopted the name Yahoshafat Ben Avraham. He formally converted to Judaism with a Rabbinical court on August 26, 2020.

In the early morning hours of February 6, 2012, Stoudemire&#x27;s older brother, Hazell, was killed in a car accident in Polk County, Florida. He was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash.

In December 2014, Stoudemire purchased a farm in Hyde Park, New York, which includes a log home. Stoudemire said that he intended to use the property as a place where his family can get together on weekends and in the off-season.

==Off the court==

===Philanthropy===
Stoudemire started the Each One, Teach One foundation in 2003. Stoudemire also funded his very own AAU team, named Team STAT. Stoudemire played &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; during its NBA week and donated all his winnings to the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Greater Phoenix area. In November 2008, Stoudemire received the NBA&#x27;s Community Assist Award, for his work with his Each 1, Teach 1 Foundation, and its efforts to provide safe drinking water in Sierra Leone by funding the building of water wells in impoverished villages. Stoudemire visited the country in summer 2008, making visits to water well sites and meeting with President Ernest Bai Koroma and the rest of the cabinet. In 2010 Stoudemire hosted the first Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire Basketball Academy in Mali. That same year, he posed shirtless on behalf of PETA&#x27;s Ink Not Mink campaign, protesting the wearing of animal fur.

===Film and television===
After guest appearances on &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 2011, Amar&#x27;e appeared on TV Land&#x27;s &quot;The Exes&quot; opposite Kristen Johnston in a January episode. Stoudemire also appeared on Fox&#x27;s comedy series, &quot;The Mindy Project&quot;, where Mindy Kaling&#x27;s character went on an outing with her co-workers to a nightclub, and wound up hanging in the VIP section with the New York big man. Stoudemire&#x27;s acting roles have not been limited to television. He had a role in the film &quot;MacGruber&quot; and appeared in the blockbuster romance &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;. He also appeared as himself in the comedy film &quot;Trainwreck&quot;, as one of the patients of sports surgeon Dr. Aaron Conners (played by Bill Hader).

===Other ventures===
In 2011, Stoudemire started his own clothing line, which launched at Macy&#x27;s in late 2011. It was designed with the help of Rachel Roy. Stoudemire described the line as &quot;courtside apparel for the fashion-forward female&quot;. Stoudemire has his own record label named Hypocalypto and has signed rappers from Phoenix to Atlanta.

In August 2011, Stoudemire signed a deal with Scholastic Press to write a series of middle-grade chapter books called &quot;&quot;. The first book in the series, &quot;STAT: Home Court&quot;, which Stoudemire described as biographical, was published in August 2012.

In the summer of 2013, Stoudemire became a major shareholder of Hapoel Jerusalem B.C. together with sports agent Arn Tellem and Ori Allon. Later that year, he also became an assistant coach for the Canadian men&#x27;s national basketball team for the 2013 Maccabiah Games.

<doc id="215968" wikidata="Q326956" url="?curid=215968" title="Uji">
<text>is a city on the southern outskirts of the city of Kyoto, in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.

Founded on March 1, 1951, Uji is between the two ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto. The city sits on the Uji River, which has its source in Lake Biwa.

 Uji has a population of 179,630 and is the second largest city in Kyoto Prefecture. It has an area of 67.54 km2, giving it a population density of 2,660 persons per km2.

==History==

In the 4th century the son of Emperor Ōjin established a palace in Uji. The 11th-century author, Murasaki Shikibu, set much of the final chapters of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; at Uji.

The first battle of Uji in 1180 was the first clash of the Genpei War. Taira forces caught up with Minamoto forces that were attempting to make their way to Nara and defeated them. Later in the war, two factions of Genji clashed at the second battle of Uji in 1184. In 1221, the Jōkyū War was decided at the third battle of Uji, in which forces of the Kamakura shogunate defeated the retired emperor Go-Toba, consolidating the shogunate&#x27;s control over Japan and the Hōjō clan&#x27;s control over the shogunate. 

&quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408) promoted cultivation of Uji tea in the area. Since then Uji has been an important production and distribution center of superior quality green tea. Tsuen tea has been served since 1160 and is still sold in the oldest tea shop in Japan and possibly the world—the Tsuen tea shop. In the 15th century, &quot;shimamono&quot; tea jars destined to be used in the Japanese tea ceremony were brought by the &quot;shōgun&quot; from Luzon to Uji.

Uji contains the ethnic Korean enclave Utoro district, which was formed from forced laborers who were made to build an airstrip in Kyoto beginning in 1941.

==Geography==
* Lake Ogura
* Uji River

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Uji has recently plateaued after decades of strong growth.
==Sightseeing and events==


Most visitors are attracted to Uji for its centuries-old historic sites, which include many Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples and Hindu Shrines. Among the most famous are the Ujigami Shrine (built in 1060) and the Byōdō-in that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto&quot;. The Byōdō-in, with its Amida (Phoenix) Hall built in 1053, is featured on the obverse side of the 10 yen coin. It was also featured on several Japanese postage stamps, a. o. of 1950, 1957 and 1959.

Other religious sites include the Manpuku-ji, the head temple of the Ōbaku Zen sect, built in Chinese Ming style in 1661 and the Zen temple Kōshō-ji, with its Kotozaka entrance (framed with dense thickets of cherry, kerria, azalea, and maple trees, each of which dramatically changes color with the seasons) constructed in 1648. Noteworthy is the Mimuroto-ji, which is famous for its purple hydrangeas. The city features numerous other small Shinto shrines. With a few exceptions, most of the important historical sites are in walking distance of one another and all are easily accessed by rail.

The last ten chapters of the Japanese classic novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; take place in Uji, and so there is The Tale of Genji Museum.

Uji has many natural attractions, including its scenic riverside, large parks, and a botanical garden. Slightly upriver from Uji bridge, the Amagase Dam spans the river and day trippers can walk to its base in about an hour. The route, which begins directly across from Keihan Uji Station, is along the river on a paved road and offers access to several grassy open spaces where people can rest and picnic.

The city hosts two major festivals each year. The Agata Festival, held on June 5, begins in the early morning and runs until late at night. Like many cities in Japan, Uji hosts an hours-long fireworks festival on August 10. Both events draw huge crowds and require that the town&#x27;s main thoroughfare to be shut down.

There is cormorant fishing in summer during the evening, from mid-June to late September.

Every August, Seicho-no-Ie holds a (annual ancestor ceremony) at , a special Seicho-no-Ie head temple located next to in Uji.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Uji is served by three rail companies: JR West, Keihan, and Kintetsu. The Keihan line which runs primarily between Kyoto and downtown Osaka serves the city via the branch Uji Line running from Chushojima station and ending along the river at Keihan Uji Station beside the Uji Bridge. The station is close to Uji&#x27;s Tale of Genji Town, Uji Bridge, and the Byodoin. All trains on this line stop at every station.

The JR Nara Line runs between Kyoto and Nara. JR Uji station was, until a few years ago, fairly rural but was recently rebuilt to better serve the city. Architecturally it mimics the Byodo-in and is on the opposite side of the Uji river, about 10 minutes&#x27; walk from Keihan Uji Station. The clock in front of the station is of special interest and, every hour on the hour, opens to reveal an automated show that celebrates the town&#x27;s heritage as a center of tea production. Like Keihan Uji Station, JR Uji has easy access to the same sites. The station is served by local and express trains.

Kintetsu serves West Uji with a line between Kyoto and Nara and does not have a station named for the town. The line is primarily used by commuters and includes , , and . No stations are close to the main tourist sites.

===Bus===
Local buses have routes in the city and public transportation is good. Charter buses to and from the Kansai International (KIX) and Itami airports can be caught at most of the train stations.

===Roads===

Uji is south of the main Meishin Expressway and is served directly by the Keiji Bypass, a toll road that was completed a few years ago. The Keiji Bypass circumvents Kyoto and Ōtsu which can be subject to traffic jams. The road is notable for its high trestles and series of long tunnels — including one that is approximately six miles long. The Keiji Bypass links to Dai Ni Keihan Road (Number Two Kyoto Osaka Road) which is under construction and usable for at least part of its length.

Non-toll roads include Route 1 which runs between Kyoto and Osaka and Route 24 which runs between Kyoto and Nara. These roads are usually filled with traffic and have many stoplights. Close by is Route 307, which runs east/west along the southern edge of the city between Osaka and Shiga prefecture. This is a fairly rural road that leads through the mountains and, once away from the urban centers, makes a nice day trip.

Of special interest to motorsports enthusiasts is the Ujigawa Line (Uji River Line). This twisty road parallels the Uji River between Uji and Otsu and is a favorite for racers. The road is dangerous and often claims lives. Due to numerous accidents, the route is closed to motorcycles for most of August, when Japanese schools are typically out of session.

==Friendship cities==
Uji has friendship agreements with three other cities:
* Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada
* Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka
* Xianyang, Shaanxi, People&#x27;s Republic of China

<doc id="215971" wikidata="Q1190495" url="?curid=215971" title="Division of property">
<text>Division of property, also known as equitable distribution, is a division of property and debt between spouses when the marital relationship is ending. It may be done by agreement, through a property settlement, or by judicial decree.

Distribution of property is the division, due to a death or the dissolution of a marriage, of property which was owned by the deceased, or acquired during the course of the marriage.

==United Kingdom law==
In England &amp; Wales, partners in or out of marriage can agree how the joint and severally hold assets will be divided without the intervention of the courts. Where agreement cannot be reached, the courts may be asked to determine a fair and equitable division. The case of Miller v Miller gave the wife a considerable proportion of the husband&#x27;s recent gains resulting from dealings in the City even though the marriage was short lived.

==United States law==
In &quot;Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So.2d 921 (Miss. 1994)&quot;, the court described equitable distribution of marital property at divorce as more fair, or equitable, than the separate property system. The court may consider such factors as &quot;substantial contribution to the accumulation of the property, the market and emotional value of the assets, tax and other economic consequences of the distribution, the parties&#x27; needs, and any other factor relevant to an equitable outcome.&quot; Fairness is the prevailing guideline the court will use. Alimony payments, child support obligations and all other property will be considered. Even non-tangible contributions such as a spouse&#x27;s domestic contributions to the household will be taken into account, whether that spouse has anything titled in their name or not. A spouse who has made non-tangible contributions may claim an equitable interest in the marital property at divorce.

The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act §307 (UMDA §307) also allows for the equitable distribution of property and lists factors the court should consider, e.g. &quot;the duration of the marriage, and prior marriage of either party, antenuptial agreement of the parties [which is the same as a prenuptial agreement or premarital agreement], the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties, custodials provisions...&quot; etc. Marital misconduct is not a factor in the decision-making process.

Another form of property distribution at divorce is called &quot;community property distribution&quot;.

Equitable distribution is not the same as equal distribution. For example, upon dissolution of a marriage in which the wife served as a stay-at-home mother for a substantial portion of the marriage, a court may award the wife a more-than-50% share of distributed property as advance compensation for her projected need to return to the work force at a lower wage than she would have been able to command had she spent her time developing outside-the-home work experience rather than laboring inside the home.

<text>Currency substitution is the use of a foreign currency in parallel to or instead of a domestic currency.

Currency substitution can be full or partial. Full currency substitution can occur after a major economic crisis, such as in Ecuador, El Salvador, and Zimbabwe. Some small economies, for whom it is impractical to maintain an independent currency, use the currencies of their larger neighbours; for example, Liechtenstein uses the Swiss franc.

Partial currency substitution occurs when residents of a country choose to hold a significant share of their financial assets denominated in a foreign currency. It can also occur as a gradual conversion to full currency substitution; for example, Argentina and Peru were both in the process of converting to the U.S. dollar during the 1990s.

==Name==
&quot;Dollarization&quot;, when referring to currency substitution, does not necessarily involve use of the United States dollar. The major currencies used as substitutes are the US dollar and the euro.

==Origins==


After the gold standard was abandoned at the outbreak of World War I and the Bretton Woods Conference following World War II, some countries sought exchange rate regimes to promote global economic stability, and hence their own prosperity. Countries usually peg their currency to a major convertible currency. &quot;Hard pegs&quot; are exchange rate regimes that demonstrate a stronger commitment to a fixed parity (i.e. currency boards) or relinquish control over their own currency (such as currency unions) while &quot;soft pegs&quot; are more flexible and floating exchange rate regimes. The collapse of &quot;soft&quot; pegs in Southeast Asia and Latin America in the late 1990s led to currency substitution becoming a serious policy issue.

A few cases of full currency substitution prior to 1999 had been the consequence of political and historical factors. In all long-standing currency substitution cases, historical and political reasons have been more influential than an evaluation of the economic effects of currency substitution. Panama adopted the US dollar as legal tender after independence as the result of a constitutional ruling. Ecuador and El Salvador became fully dollarized economies in 2000 and 2001 respectively, for different reasons. Ecuador underwent currency substitution to deal with a widespread political and financial crisis resulting from massive loss of confidence in its political and monetary institutions. By contrast, El Salvador&#x27;s official currency substitution was a result of internal debates and in a context of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and long-standing unofficial currency substitution. The eurozone adopted the euro (€) as its common currency and sole legal tender in 1999, which might be considered a variety of full-commitment regime similar to full currency substitution despite some evident differences from other currency substitutions.

==Measures==
There are two common indicators of currency substitution. The first measure is the share of foreign currency deposits (FCD) in the domestic banking system in the broad money including FCD. The second is the share of all foreign currency deposits held by domestic residents at home and abroad in their total monetary assets.

==Types==
Unofficial currency substitution or de facto currency substitution is the most common type of currency substitution. Unofficial currency substitution occurs when residents of a country choose to hold a significant share of their financial assets in foreign currency, even though the foreign currency is not legal tender there. They hold deposits in the foreign currency because of a bad track record of the local currency, or as a hedge against inflation of the domestic currency.

Official currency substitution or full currency substitution happens when a country adopts a foreign currency as its sole legal tender, and ceases to issue the domestic currency. Another effect of a country adopting a foreign currency as its own is that the country gives up all power to vary its exchange rate. There are a small number of countries adopting a foreign currency as legal tender.

Full currency substitution has mostly occurred in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific, as many countries in those regions see the United States Dollar as a stable currency compared to the national one. For example, Panama underwent full currency substitution by adopting the US dollar as legal tender in 1904. This type of currency substitution is also known as de jure currency substitution.

Currency substitution can be used semiofficially (or officially, in bimonetary systems), where the foreign currency is legal tender alongside the domestic currency.

In literature, there is a set of related definitions of currency substitution such as external liability currency substitution, domestic liability currency substitution, banking sector&#x27;s liability currency substitution or deposit currency substitution, and credit dollarization. External liability currency substitution measures total external debt (private and public) denominated in foreign currencies of the economy. Deposit currency substitution can be measured as the share of foreign currency deposits in the total deposits of the banking system, and credit currency substitution can be measured as the share of dollar credit in the total credit of the banking system.

==Effects==

===On trade and investment===
One of the main advantages of adopting a strong foreign currency as sole legal tender is to reduce the transaction costs of trade among countries using the same currency. There are at least two ways to infer this impact from data. The first is the significantly negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade in most cases, and the second is an association between transaction costs and the need to operate with multiple currencies. Economic integration with the rest of the world becomes easier as a result of lowered transaction costs and stabler prices. Rose (2000) applied the gravity model of trade and provided empirical evidence that countries sharing a common currency engage in significantly increased trade among them, and that the benefits of currency substitution for trade may be large.

Countries with full currency substitution can invoke greater confidence among international investors, inducing increased investments and growth. The elimination of the currency crisis risk due to full currency substitution leads to a reduction of country risk premiums and then to lower interest rates. These effects result in a higher level of investment. However, there is a positive association between currency substitution and interest rates in a dual-currency economy.

===On monetary and exchange rate policies===
Official currency substitution helps to promote fiscal and monetary discipline and thus greater macroeconomic stability and lower inflation rates, to lower real exchange rate volatility, and possibly to deepen the financial system. Firstly, currency substitution helps developing countries, providing a firm commitment to stable monetary and exchange rate policies by forcing a passive monetary policy. Adopting a strong foreign currency as legal tender will help to &quot;eliminate the inflation-bias problem of discretionary monetary policy&quot;. Secondly, official currency substitution imposes stronger financial constraint on the government by eliminating deficit financing by issuing money. An empirical finding suggests that inflation has been significantly lower in economies with full currency substitution than nations with domestic currencies. The expected benefit of currency substitution is the elimination of the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and a possible reduction in the country&#x27;s international exposure. Currency substitution cannot eliminate the risk of an external crisis but provides steadier markets as a result of eliminating fluctuations in exchange rates.

On the other hand, currency substitution leads to the loss of seigniorage revenue, the loss of monetary policy autonomy, and the loss of the exchange rate instruments. Seigniorage revenues are the profits generated when monetary authorities issue currency. When adopting a foreign currency as legal tender, a monetary authority needs to withdraw the domestic currency and give up future seigniorage revenue. The country loses the rights to its autonomous monetary and exchange rate policies, even in times of financial emergency. For example, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan has stated that the central bank considers the effects of its decisions only on the US economy. In a full currency substituted economy, exchange rates are indeterminate and monetary authorities cannot devalue the currency. In an economy with high currency substitution, devaluation policy is less effective in changing the real exchange rate because of significant pass-through effects to domestic prices. However, the cost of losing an independent monetary policy exists when domestic monetary authorities can commit an effective counter-cyclical monetary policy, stabilizing the business cycle. This cost depends adversely on the correlation between the business cycle of the client country (the economy with currency substitution) and the business cycle of the anchor country. In addition, monetary authorities in economies with currency substitution diminish the liquidity assurance to their banking system.

===On banking systems===
In an economy with full currency substitution, monetary authorities cannot act as lender of last resort to commercial banks by printing money. The alternatives to lending to the bank system may include taxation and issuing government debt. The loss of the lender of last resort is considered a cost of full currency substitution. This cost depends on the initial level of unofficial currency substitution before moving to a full currency substituted economy. This relation is negative because in a heavily currency substituted economy, the central bank already fears difficulties in providing liquidity assurance to the banking system. However, literature points out the existence of alternative mechanisms to provide liquidity insurance to banks, such as a scheme by which the international financial community charges an insurance fee in exchange for a commitment to lend to a domestic bank.

Commercial banks in countries where saving accounts and loans in foreign currency are allowed may face two types of risks:
#Currency mismatch risk: Assets and liabilities on the balance sheets may be in different denominations. This may arise if the bank converts foreign currency deposits into local currency and lends in local currency or vice versa.
#Default risk: Arises if the bank uses the foreign currency deposits to lend in foreign currency.
However, currency substitution eliminates the probability of a currency crisis that negatively affects the banking system through the balance sheet channel. Currency substitution may reduce the possibility of systematic liquidity shortages and the optimal reserves in the banking system. Research has shown that official currency substitution has played a significant role in improving bank liquidity and asset quality in Ecuador and El Salvador.

==Determinants of the process==

===The dynamics of the flight from domestic money===
High and unanticipated inflation rates decrease the demand for domestic money and raise the demand for alternative assets, including foreign currency and assets dominated by foreign currency. This phenomenon is called the &quot;flight from domestic money&quot;. It results in a rapid and sizable process of currency substitution. In countries with high inflation rates, the domestic currency tends to be gradually displaced by a stable currency. At the beginning of this process, the store-of-value function of the domestic currency is replaced by the foreign currency. Then, the unit-of-account function of the domestic currency is displaced when many prices are quoted in a foreign currency. A prolonged period of high inflation will induce the domestic currency to lose its function as medium of exchange when the public carries out many transactions in foreign currency.

Ize and Levy-Yeyati (1998) examine the determinants of deposit and credit currency substitution, concluding that currency substitution is driven by the volatility of inflation and the real exchange rate. Currency substitution increases with inflation volatility and decreases with the volatility of the real exchange rate.

===Institutional factors===
The flight from domestic money depends on a country&#x27;s institutional factors. The first factor is the level of development of the domestic financial market. An economy with a well-developed financial market can offer a set of alternative financial instruments denominated in domestic currency, reducing the role of foreign currency as an inflation hedge. The pattern of the currency substitution process also varies across countries with different foreign exchange and capital controls. In a country with strict foreign exchange regulations, the demand for foreign currency will be satisfied in the holding of foreign currency assets abroad and outside the domestic banking system. This demand often puts pressure on the parallel market of foreign currency and on the country&#x27;s international reserves. Evidence for this pattern is given in the absence of currency substitution during the pre-reform period in most transition economies, because of constricted controls on foreign exchange and the banking system. In contrast, by increasing foreign currency reserves, a country might mitigate the shift of assets abroad and strengthen its external reserves in exchange for a currency substitution process. However, the effect of this regulation on the pattern of currency substitution depends on the public&#x27;s expectations of macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of the foreign exchange regime.

<text>Kogaionidae is a family of fossil mammals within the extinct order Multituberculata. Representatives are known from the Upper Cretaceous and the Paleocene of Europe. Having started as island endemics on Hateg Island during the Upper Cretaceous, where they were in fact the dominant mammal group and diverged into rather unique ecological niches, they expanded across Europe in the Paleocene, where they briefly became a major component of its mammal fauna before their extinction. They are considered to be basal members of Cimolodonta.

==Classification==
This family is part of the suborder Cimolodonta, generally accepted as closely related to Taeniolabidoidea.

These small multituberculates were named by Rădulescu R. and Samson P. in 1996, who stated they 
:&quot;Share with Taeniolabidoidea the general shape of the skull, with anterior part of zygomatic arches directed roughly transversely and very short basicranial region, which gives the skull a square-like appearance, but differ from them in having a strongly elongated snout and different dentition,&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum 2001, p.418).

Recent studies have favoured a position close to Taeniolabidoidea. A 2021 study found them to be the amongst the most basal members of Cimolodonta, more derived only than &quot;Bryceomys&quot;, and they probably originated from an eobaatarid-like ancestor.

==Biology==
Like some modern rodents and shrews, at least some kogaionids had red, iron-pigmented enamel. In &quot;Barbatodon&quot; this distribution is more similar to that seen in shrews as opposed to the condition seen in rodents, and suggests insectivore habits. This is a unique evolutionary route taken in the isolation of their island environment, almost entirely deprived of competing mammals, and inadvertently resulted in their survival across the KT event.

In &quot;Litovoi tholocephalos&quot;, there was an extreme brain size reduction, displaying one of the smallest brains in proportion to body size of any derived mammal. Additionally, it bore a small dome in its head, like a pachycephalosaur.

==Range==
Kogaionids first appear as island endemics on Maastrichtian Romania, then isolated from the rest of Europe. They are in fact the only European multituberculates from the Late Cretaceous, in contrast to the Early Cretaceous&#x27; massive multituberculate diversity in Britain and the Iberian Peninsula. A supposed kogaionid is also known from the Campanian of Appalachia, but its identity as a kogaionid is ambiguous and rather unlikely considering the otherwise Hateg Island-restricted range.

Perhaps due to their insectivorous habits, kogaionids managed to survive the KT event. During the Paleocene Hateg Island connected to the rest of Europe, and so these multituberculates dispersed; fossils are known in France, Spain and Belgium, beside Romania&#x27;s Paleocene deposits at Jisou. For a brief period of time these were among the most common mammals in Europe, but by the Late Paleocene the arrival of other multituberculate groups from North America brought a quick decline, culminating in its extinction at the PETM.

<doc id="215975" wikidata="Q4540608" url="?curid=215975" title="Paternity law">
<text>Paternity law refers to body of law underlying legal relationship between a father and his biological or adopted children and deals with the rights and obligations of both the father and the child to each other as well as to others. A child&#x27;s paternity may be relevant in relation to issues of legitimacy, inheritance and rights to a putative father&#x27;s title or surname, as well as the biological father&#x27;s rights to child custody in the case of separation or divorce and obligations for child support.

Under common law, a child born to a married woman is presumed to be the child of her husband by virtue of a &quot;presumption of paternity&quot; or presumption of legitimacy. In consideration of a possible non-paternity event (which may or may not include paternity fraud) these presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, for example, in disputed child custody and child support cases during divorce, annulment or legal separation.

In the case of a father not married to a child&#x27;s mother, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction:
* a man may accept the paternity of the child in what is called an acknowledgment of paternity, voluntary acknowledgement of paternity or affidavit of parentage,
* the mother or legal authorities can file a petition for a determination of paternity against a putative father, or
* paternity can be determined by the courts through estoppel over time.

Today, when paternity is in dispute or doubt, paternity testing may be used to conclusively resolve the issue.

==Overview==
The legal process of determining paternity normally results in the naming of a man to a child&#x27;s birth certificate as the child&#x27;s legal father. A paternity finding resolves issues of legitimacy, and may be followed by court rulings that relate to child support and maintenance, custody and guardianship.

==Unmarried fathers==
Generally, under common law, a biological father has a legal obligation for the maintenance or support of his biological offspring, whether or not he is legally competent to marry the child&#x27;s mother.

In jurisdictions where there is no presumption of paternity there is a process for fathers to recognise their children and become the legal father of the child.

==Married fathers==
In the United States, where a child is conceived or born during wedlock, the husband is legally presumed to be the father of the child. Some states have a legal process for a husband to disavow paternity, such that a biological father can be named as the parent of a child conceived or born during a marriage. In most states, any claim of non-paternity by a husband must be heard by a court.

If parents litigate a divorce case without raising the issue of paternity, in most states they will be barred from disputing the husband&#x27;s paternity in a later court proceeding. Depending upon state law, it may nonetheless be possible for a man claiming to be the child&#x27;s biological father to commence a paternity case following the divorce.

==Legal proceedings==
Where paternity of the child is in question, a party may ask the court to determine paternity of one or more possible fathers (called putative fathers), typically based initially upon sworn statements and then upon testimony or other evidence.

Once paternity has been legally established, if the court finds that to do so would be contrary to the best interest of the child, in most U.S. states a court may deny DNA testing or decline to remove a husband from a child&#x27;s birth certificate based upon DNA testing.

A successful application to the court results in an order assigning paternity to a specific man, possibly including support responsibility and/or visitation rights, or declaring that one or more men (possibly including the husband of the mother) are not the father of the child. A disavowal action is a legal proceeding where a putative father attempts to prove to the court that he is not the father; if successful, it relieves the former putative father of legal responsibility for the child.

On the other hand, it could be the case where several putative fathers are fighting to establish custody. In the United States, a state may legally bar a third party from disputing the paternity of a child born within an intact marriage.

Some paternity laws assign full parental responsibility to fathers even in cases of women lying about contraception, using deceit (such as oral sex followed by self-artificial insemination) or statutory rape by a woman (&quot;Hermesmann v. Seyer&quot;).

==Paternity and inheritance rights==
If the context of inheritance rights, it will be the heirs of the deceased person who are attempting to dispute or establish paternity. In some states, DNA testing will be dispositive to establish paternity. In many jurisdictions, however, there are a variety of rules and time restrictions that can deny inheritance rights to biological children of a deceased father.

<text>Barbatodon is a mammal genus from the Upper Cretaceous period. It lived in Transylvania at the same time as some of the last dinosaurs and was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. It is within the suborder of Cimolodonta, and the family Kogaionidae. The genus &quot;Barbatodon&quot; was named by Constantin Rădulescu and Petre Mihai Samson in 1986.

The primary species, &quot;Barbatodon transylvanicum&quot;, was also named by Rãdulescu and Samson. It was found in strata dating to the Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) of the Sânpetru Formation in Romania.

&quot;Based on comparisons with the m1s from Vălioara, the holotype of &quot;Barbatodon&quot; is regarded as a kogaionid m1,&quot; Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001) had it placed tentatively in the informal &quot;&#x27;Paracimexomys&quot; group&#x27;.

A new species, &quot;B. oardaensis&quot;, has been announced in 2014. The species has been discovered in Oarda de Jos, Hațeg Basin, Transylvania. It is characterized by M1 cusp formula 3:4:2 and is much smaller than the two other known species.

Most of Europe was covered by shallow seas during the Upper Cretaceous, which makes remains of terrestrial animals extremely rare. This location is one of the exceptions and the diversity of material is impressive.

==Biology==
Like modern rodents and shrews, as well as the related taeniolabidoid multituberculates, &quot;Barbatodon&quot; displays red iron-pigmentation in its teeth. This distribution is more similar to that seen in shrews than in rodents or taeniolabidoids, suggesting insectivorous habits. In the absence of competing mammals, &quot;Barbatodon&quot; and similar kogaionids display a clear example of island speciation.

<text>Civil-law notaries, or Latin notaries, are lawyers of noncontentious private civil law who draft, take, and record legal instruments for private parties, provide legal advice and give attendance in person, and are vested as public officers with the authentication power of the State. As opposed to most notaries public, their common-law counterparts, civil-law notaries are highly trained, licensed practitioners providing a full range of regulated legal services, and whereas they hold a public office, they nonetheless operate usually—but not always—in private practice and are paid on a fee-for-service basis. They often receive generally the same education as attorneys at civil law with further specialized education but without qualifications in advocacy, procedural law, or the law of evidence, somewhat comparable to solicitor training in certain common-law countries.

Civil-law notaries are limited to areas of private law, that is, domestic law which regulates the relationships between individuals and in which the State is not directly concerned. The most common areas of practice for civil-law notaries are in residential and commercial conveyancing and registration, contract drafting, company formation, successions and estate planning, and powers of attorney. Ordinarily, they have no authority to appear in court on their client&#x27;s behalf; their role is limited to drafting, authenticating, and registering certain types of transactional or legal instruments. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, or Québec (Canada) among others, they also retain and keep a minute copy of their instruments—in the form of memoranda—in notarial protocols, or archives.

Notaries generally hold undergraduate degrees in civil law and graduate degrees in notarial law. Notarial law involves expertise in a broad spectrum of private law including family law, estate and testamentary law, conveyancing and property law, the law of agency, and contract and company law. Student notaries must complete a long apprenticeship or articled clerkship as a trainee notary and usually spend some years as a junior associate in a notarial firm before working as a partner or opening a private practice. Any such practice is usually tightly regulated, and most countries parcel out areas into notarial districts with a set number of notary positions. This has the effect of making notarial appointments very limited.

==Notarial instruments==
As a lawyer, a civil-law notary draws up and executes legal instruments called notarial instruments (Fr &quot;acte notarié&quot;, Sp &quot;instrumento notarial&quot;, It &quot;atto notarile&quot;, Du &quot;notariële akte&quot;, Ger &quot;notarielle Urkunde&quot;, &quot;Notariatsurkunde&quot;). To be valid, a notarial instrument must be signed contemporaneously (&quot;uno contextu&quot;) by the (parties to the instrument), sometimes in the presence of attesting witnesses, before the notary who also signs and officiates the signing ceremony.

===Status at law===
Notarial instruments, if &quot;prima facie&quot; duly executed, are:
* presumed valid and regular;
* self-authenticating;
* probative (i.e., proof of their contents);
* public;
* self-executing; and
* have a &quot;data certa&quot;, i.e., a fixed, unalterable effective date.
Traditionally, notarial instruments trigger a entailing two consequences—regularity and probativity. First, being an official act, a presumption of regularity attaches to the instrument, meaning all prescribed formalities have been carried out, including the reading over of the instrument. Second, a notarial instrument is self-authenticating and probative, i.e., it constitutes full proof of the agreement it contains, as against the parties, their heirs, and successors. It also means the notary&#x27;s firsthand (&quot;de visu et auditu suis sensibus&quot;) narrations of fact are conclusively presumed true and correct, whereas secondhand narrations (appearers&#x27; representations) are merely &quot;assertio notarii&quot; which are rebuttably presumed valid. While all notarial instruments are official documents, they are not all necessarily public; most instruments are in public form, meaning an original is retained &quot;in publica custodia&quot; by the notary in his or her protocol or recorded with a public registry, but some are in private form, that is, a single original is issued directly to the . In either case, the appearer always walks away with an instrument that is self-executing, that is, it requires no further implementing action to be effective and enforceable, just like a court order. Finally, notarial instruments have a fixed effective or signature date (&quot;data certa&quot;) that cannot be ante- or postdated, or left blank and filled in after signing.

====Secondary effects====
Notarial instruments cannot be altered or overridden by prior or subsequent instruments under hand (e.g., simple contracts). In other words, for example, a notarial will could not be amended or superseded by a non-notarial codicil or will. They also estop (preclude) an appearer as contract denier from raising most affirmative defenses as to enforceability, including: (1) &quot;non est factum&quot;, (2) the contents do not correctly express the appearers&#x27; intentions, and (3) defenses against formation (e.g., &quot;ultra vires&quot;, lack of capacity, improper execution, etc.).

One thing that distinguishes a civil-law notary&#x27;s instruments from those of a common lawyer is the fact that, under common law legal systems, drafts and non-identical copies are considered separate documents, while under civil law public documents may be proved by secondary evidence. An unexecuted minute is deemed firsthand proof of an instrument and considered the original, whereas the engrossment is not. The minute is, therefore, the &quot;authenticum&quot;, or original instrument of writing, as distinguished from the self-executing copy, or &quot;instrumentum&quot;.

====Rebuttal====
A notarial instrument&#x27;s “valid” portions are open to direct rebuttal, but the “conclusive” portions can, in some jurisdictions, only be rebutted by an action of improbation (Fr &quot;inscription de faux&quot;, It &quot;querela di falso&quot;, Germ &quot;Fälschungsklage&quot;) in which a challenger must bring a collateral attack against the instrument, proving a willful material error by strong, clear, and positively convincing proof, rather than the ordinary preponderance of evidence standard in civil actions. Legally, a successful challenge must overcome the &quot;praesumptio iustae causa&quot; which attaches to a notarial instrument, the result of which is that said instrument is presumed to have been made or formed with a &quot;iusta causa&quot;, that is, sufficient legal consideration (&quot;causa&quot;). This presumption stems from the fact that a notary is expected to verify the facts, assertions, or events mentioned in his act, thereby assuming liability for and giving warrant to its contents. A successfully improbated instrument is null and set aside.

===Forms===
Nowadays, a public-form instrument is prepared first as an unexecuted original called a minute (Fr , It , Sp , Du , Ger ). The minute is archived in the draftsman notary&#x27;s protocol (Fr &quot;protocole&quot;, It &quot;protocollo&quot;, Sp &quot;protocolo&quot;, Ger &quot;Urkundenrolle&quot;). The instrument&#x27;s particulars—appearer, fees, subject matter, witnesses, date, and so forth—are noted or minuted in a register or logbook. From the minute the notary extends a fully engrossed execution copy, known as an engrossment (Fr/Du &quot;grosse&quot;, It &quot;rogito&quot;, Sp &quot;testimonio&quot;, &quot;copia autorizada&quot;, Ger &quot;Ausfertigung&quot;), which is self-executing since it contains not only the material terms but also solemn and statutory notarial wording and, in some jurisdictions, enacting clauses like those found on court orders. It is also the only copy that has fresh signatures and seals on it. The engrossed copy is issued directly to the . However, appearers are generally only entitled to one engrossment, so any other copy issued thereafter is a notarial exemplified copy which does not contain the appearers&#x27; fresh signatures and lacks the formalities of the engrossment; exemplified copies (Fr , It , Sp , , Du , , Ger ) are therefore only for reference purposes.

Certain types of instruments are passed &quot;in private form&quot;, that is, only one copy—the original—is made and issued to the appearer while the draftsman notary does not retain a copy. Private-form instruments are usually unilateral, have short-term legal effect, and do not benefit third parties, such as certificates of good standing, powers of attorney, certificates of dishonor, statutory declarations, verifications of fact, rent and pay receipts, and pension and annuity arrears documents.

Additionally, some jurisdictions, especially those influenced by the Austrian Civil Code, divide notarial instruments into three types:
* operative (Aust &quot;Notariatsakt&quot;, Du , Sp ): memorializes and effects irrevocable legal business; includes all transactional and governing instruments;
* declaratory (Aust &quot;Notariatsprotokoll&quot;, Du , Sp ): records or notifies legal actions, facts, or rights; includes statutory declarations, company minutes, and registry memorials;
* certificatory (Germ , Du , Sp ): attests personal status details; includes life certificates, certificates of good standing, copy certifications, signature attestations.

==France==

A French civil-law notary, or , is a highly specialized lawyer in private practice appointed as a public officer by the justice minister. The profession began admitting women in 1948, and by the start of 2008 women numbered 2,104 and accounted for 24.2% of all notaries. A notarial office () usually includes ancillary staff like notaries&#x27; clerks () of different kinds, e.g., junior (), specialist (), and supervisory clerks (). Each level is divided into at least three pay grades, as well as legal secretaries, trainee notaries (), and accountants. In smaller offices, succession clerks are kept separate since their work differs significantly from other practice areas; in larger firms, clerks are separated into divisions by specialization. While most clerks are caseworkers, some work as costing specialists or formalities clerks. Secretaries oftentimes go on to pursue clerking.

===Education===
Notaries and notaries&#x27; clerks—a form of paralegal—earn undergraduate law degrees () from an accredited notarial law school (). Managing clerks () must obtain a special graduate clerking degree ().

Law graduates must then earn a 1-year master&#x27;s degree in law (MCL) () and either continue in a university law school or enroll at a notary institute () to earn a second graduate degree in notarial law for which specializations exist, including: conflict of laws, advanced tax law, overseas territories, EU law, struggling businesses, company law, intellectual property, farm tenancy and agri-business, city planning and environmental law, and estate planning.

There are 2 postgraduate options: a university track () and a vocational track ().

* University track: 1 year of university coursework for a Master&#x27;s in notarial law (), followed by a 2-year, in-office traineeship (), supplemented with 4 semester-long practice courses and capped by a Master&#x27;s thesis. At the end the graduate receives a .
* Vocational track: begins with a competitive entrance exam in applied legal studies and is followed by 1 year of institute coursework for a Postgraduate Diploma in Notarial Practice (). Students must also complete a 2-year traineeship supplemented with 6 week-long practice seminars.

Formerly, there was a non-degree option involving a lengthy apprenticeship. In addition, notaries&#x27; clerks with a minimum of 9 years of in-office experience, with 6 of those spent as a junior clerk, as well as judges and attorneys/solicitors of 6 years standing, may become a notary by passing a professional exam. Notaries are also required to attend regular continuing education courses and seminars.

===Practice===
In France, notarial instruments, whether in public () or private form (), have a high degree of authority and are considered probative instruments (), received as firsthand and primary evidence in court, and thereby accorded high evidentiary value and executory force, and deemed to be proof of their contents. A notarial instrument also fixes the date at which its parties are bound without prior delivery and acceptance (as opposed to a deed or contract under common law) and the () of the act&#x27;s execution so as to safeguard against third party claims. To be rebutted or challenged, a notarial act must be subjected to a rescissory action called an improbation action () to prove the act contains errors or has been maliciously altered, interlineated, edited, or falsified.

Notaries engage in a wide variety of legal activities ranging from contract drafting and legal advising—primarily in company, family, and property law. Roughly 50% of French notarial business involves real estate conveyancing, leasing, and construction. Domestic affairs, e.g., adoptions, marital agreements, divorces, and the like, as well as estate planning account for another 26%. Preparing notarial acts for private parties, informing parties as to the scope of their contractual obligations, ensuring that the instrument or contract is fair and unbiased, and acting as a non-contentious and impartial advocate for the business transaction as a whole, notaries prevent and resolve many potential conflicts beforehand.

Notaries have a monopoly on marital agreements, marital property systems, estate administration, and conveyancing (realty sales, mortgages, etc.). They are also experts in the law of property with exclusive access to France&#x27;s M.I.N. database which contains all property transfer and conveyance information. This gives notaries a singular advantage in gauging the property market, thus allowing them to appraise property, conduct transactions, and handle taxes and financing.

In France, when a notarial act is passed before one notary subscribing, it is said to be , or in simple form, and when before two notaries with the second attesting, then it is , or in solemn form. Acts may be drawn up in public or private form, said and respectively. When drawn in private form, the single executed original is issued to the client, and its particulars are logged in the notary&#x27;s register. When in public form, one un-executed minute copy () is retained of record in the notary&#x27;s protocol, thereby constituting a public instrument, and a fully engrossed execution copy (called a and now termed ) is issued to the client and is headed and footed with the same or &quot;enactment clause&quot; used on court orders and writs. Minutes and engrossments are only drawn up once, and, should a past client lose their copy or need further copies, by law, said person may only receive exemplifications (, now termed ) of the act. Notaries also issue detailed or summary abstracts of acts () and make notarial certified copies () of documents not in their custody.

===Professional organizations===
All French notaries are jointly and severally liable for professional errors in the performance of their duties. When liable, damages are paid from a nationwide consolidated indemnity fund. Group liability of this kind is otherwise unprecedented. Notaries are therefore required to take out professional indemnity insurance for the due protection of their clients. French notaries are part of and regulated by a local or county notaries society, or , on whose advice notaries are appointed and who conduct annual accounting audits of notarial offices, establish and regulate professional and ethical standards, and can censure or temporarily suspend notaries. Notaries are also members of a regional notaries council () which acts very much like a common-law college of notaries by providing continuing education and other support services to notaries; they also take disciplinary action against notary misconduct including dismissal, removal from office, and revoking a notary&#x27;s license to practice. The regional councils are governed and headed by the National Council of Notaries () which conducts surprise inspections, provides research, outlook, and public relations services, and acts as the profession&#x27;s administrative head.

==Germany==
In Germany, the main function of a &quot;Notar&quot; (pl. &quot;Notare&quot;, fem. &quot;Notarin&quot;) is to draw up, execute, and retain legal instruments transacting or governing noncontentious matters in reserved areas of law:
* real property (conveyancing, servitudes, real securities)
* successions (wills and , estate planning, executorships)
* family law (marital agreements, healthcare proxies, alimony &amp; child support agreements)
* company law (formation, restructuring, registration, corporate minutes)

Prospective notaries must have the same basic legal education as attorneys/solicitors: first, they must be law graduates who have passed the first legal practice exam (&quot;erste juristische Staatsprüfung&quot;); then, they must article as a judicial clerk for 2 years and pass the second legal practice exam (&quot;zweite juristische Staatsprüfung&quot;). In addition, dual-practice notaries (&quot;Anwaltsnotar&quot;) must have 5 years standing as a practicing attorney/solicitor and pass a competitive notarial practice exam (&quot;notarielle Fachprüfung&quot;) before being admitted as notaries. Single-practice notaries (&quot;Nur-Notar&quot;), on the other hand, must article for 3 years as a trainee notary (&quot;Notarassessor&quot;). German notaries are appointed by authority of their state justice minister, draft notarial instruments (&quot;notarielle Urkunde&quot;) and retain them of record in their protocol (&quot;Urkundenrolle&quot;), and provide independent and impartial advice to all interested parties (&quot;Beteiligte&quot;). A notary&#x27;s instruments are valid nationwide.

The mode of practice depends on the state, but in all, 1,700 German notaries practice exclusively as a notary versus 4,800 practicing dually as an attorney-notary. Notaries maintain independent private practices. Single-practice notaries practice as a notary sole (&quot;Einzelnotar&quot;) or in a 2-person partnership (&quot;Zweier-Sozietät&quot;), whereas attorney-notaries structure themselves into law firms of varying size.

German notaries prepare instruments according to federal statutory guidelines and advise appearers on their legal obligations and consequences. A notary&#x27;s statutory duties are:
* to satisfy himself of the identity of the appearers (&quot;Erschienenen&quot; or &quot;Urkundsparteien&quot;);
* to verify the parties to contracts are competent to enter into them;
* &quot;Belehrungspflicht&quot;: to rigorously explain to appearers the contents and legal implications of the instrument; and
* to have the appearers sign before and with the notary and sometimes in the presence of witnesses.
The notary affixes his official seal (&quot;Dienstsiegel&quot;) to the instrument and binds it with thin cords (&quot;Verbindung&quot;, &quot;Heftung&quot;). If the instrument is &quot;prima facie&quot; duly executed, courts will enforce it, presume it valid and regular, and admit it as evidence to prove the truth of its contents.

In Germany, notaries are very important in day-to-day business. For example, any real estate sales contract (§ 311(b), German Civil Code), articles of association, alimony or child support agreement, or contract concerning succession () must be in notarial form. Likewise, any share purchase or asset transfer agreement of a private limited company (&quot;GmbH&quot;) must be notarially executed pursuant to s. 15(3) of the &quot;Private Limited Companies Act (GmbHG)&quot;. Contracts requiring notarial execution can be drafted by the executing notary, the parties, or by an attorney/solicitor.

== Indonesia ==
Every Indonesian notary (, a professional directly copied from Dutch practice, is a member of the Indonesian Society of Notaries (, INI) and are very similar to his or her Dutch counterpart. However, agrarian reforms starting with the passing of the 1960 Land Act (itself replacing the Dutch East Indian &quot;Agrarische Wet&quot; of 1870, commonly referred to the act that started the Dutch East Indian liberal period) &quot;de jure&quot; removed real estate transactions from the notary&#x27;s practice areas. All real estate transactions are now &quot;de jure&quot; executed by conveyancers (, , abbreviated as PPAT) appointed by the (in comparison, civil law notaries are appointed by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights), however most notaries often have dual-status as conveyancers.

==Italy==
Notaries in Italy are professionals working in private-practice and paid on a fee-for-service basis, or, should they not earn enough money, by the national Notarial Trust (), a public body funded by the notaries themselves, which also manages their pensions upon retirement.

In order to be admitted as a notary in Italy a candidate must pass a public exam open to all Italian citizens who:
* possess full citizenship rights and have not been convicted of any crimes;
* have successfully completed a university degree in law ();
* have successfully completed an 18-month traineeship (articling) under a qualified notary (a notary who has served as such for more than 5 years);
* are less than 50 years of age;
* did not fail 5 previous attempts at the notary exam.

The public exam is composed of two parts, a written and an oral portion. The written portion consists of drafting three full notarial instruments (), justifying the choices made in those instruments (), and a theoretical part about the topics covered in the exam ().
The three tests are about the three most important areas of expertise of a notary: law of succession (), contract law () and company law (). If a candidate achieves a sufficient score on the written test, he or she is admitted to the oral exam during which other subjects such as tax law are evaluated.

A national score report is published afterwards, and notaries admitted to practice are appointed to a certain practice area (city, rural area) based on their choices and their performance on the exam. After receiving their seal of office, which is the symbol of the profession and legitimizes the instruments they sign, a notary has to complete a final 6 months of training under a qualified notary.

Given the difficulty of the national exam, almost all candidates attend notary training institutes. Those schools are fully private institutions and are by no means mandatory, but virtually all successful candidates have at some point attended one or more.

An average person requires about 12 years (5 years of university, 18 months in a traineeship, an average of 5 years to pass the national exam and 6 further months of training) of continuous studies in order to become a notary. As such, notaries are among the most highly trained professionals in Italy and are held in high regard both professionally and socially.

After the training is done a notary usually opens a law office () in the practice area designated by the State. After one year they are allowed to open a second office in the same area. The law mandates a minimum of three half days to be allocated at the primary office but makes no references to a minimum or maximum fee that can be applied.

Given the relatively small number of notaries (about 5,000) and the high volume of work they are required to do, notaries are usually very expensive professionals, and consistently rank first among the best paid professional category in Italy.

Notaries are required by law whenever real estate () is donated, whenever a company changes its bylaws, or whenever relevant property (such as automobiles) is donated. Notarial instruments are legally binding, publicly available, and accorded full faith and credit for any claim until improbated (). The conclusive presumption of validity and regularity and public availability are the two main aspects of the notarial instrument as opposed to legal instruments drafted by attorneys or instruments drafted and signed by non-lawyers.

==Netherlands==

Every Dutch civil law notary () is part of the Royal Society of Notaries ( (KNB, , formerly the Royal Fraternity of Notaries () until 1 October 1997) and occupy a special position relative to other legal practitioners such as attorneys, court bailiffs, and tax advisors. This is apparent first and foremost from the fact that notaries are public officers appointed for life by the Crown and provide regulated legal services. As a qualified lawyer, a notary takes on clients, is paid on a fee-for-service basis. Life appointment is designed to safeguard the independence needed by notaries to discharge their functions.

Notaries are independent and disinterested. Unlike attorneys or legal advisors, a notary does not represent or act in the interest of any one party. Instead, under the Dutch legal system, notaries are required to act impartially on behalf of all parties to a contract or transaction. For example, when real property is conveyed, notaries act for both the seller and buyer, also as an escrow agent. They are subject to legal professional privilege and are therefore duty-bound not to betray client confidentiality, thereby giving them the right to withhold information in court as would an attorney or doctor. In cases where a notary acts as legal advisor to a particular interested party, the advising notary must counsel all parties including third-party beneficiaries.

All notaries are law graduates. Not only are they experts in family, estate, company, and property laws, but they must also stay up-to-date about pertinent cases and certain aspects of tax legislation. If necessary, a Dutch notary will instruct and call on the services of other legal practitioners. However, under no circumstances may a notary represent clients in court.

Apart from advising, a notary also draws, executes, and retains instruments either by statute or at the parties&#x27; request. Under Dutch law, a notarially executed instrument is probative as of the &quot;data certa&quot; (&quot;vaste datum&quot;) and subscription of the parties. Notaries archive the minute (protocol copy, Dutch &quot;minuut&quot;) and issue exemplifications (&quot;authentiek afschrift&quot;) to the parties. The only fully executed copy, known as the engrossment (&quot;grosse&quot;), is &quot;prima facie&quot; demonstrative evidence of its contents, similar to a court order. There is, therefore, no need for the party to or custodian of a notarial instrument to provide extraneous evidence to verify the instrument&#x27;s probativity. And under Dutch law, for instruments to be self-executing they must be drawn up as public instruments, which is why any instrument drafted by a common-law lawyer, which is never public, is not self-executing in the Netherlands.

The new &quot;Notaries Act&quot; (&quot;Wet op het Notarisambt&quot;), commenced in October 1999 (156 years after the original act), reinforces the official position of notaries, but also expands on and adds to their traditional services. The consolidation of the notary&#x27;s official position is, for example, reflected in the way the requirements of impartiality and independence have been enshrined in law, the many regulations a notary and notary&#x27;s clerk are required to adhere to, and the fact that a notary is prohibited from acting as an attorney. Market forces have widened the possibility for notary&#x27;s clerks to become notaries and for competition. However, the 1999 Act did not make substantial changes to the profession. While Dutch notaries are public officers and their instruments are public instruments, they are not government employees and instead act as independent private practitioners.

The new law makes it easier for notaries’ clerks to set up a practice and gives notaries more freedom in determining their fees for services. The Act has provided for the establishment of an external committee of experts; if notary&#x27;s clerks submit a sound business plan to the committee, they have a greater chance to be approved to set up their own practice. Greater freedom in the fees a notary can charge implies that the Royal Society of Notaries no longer fixes fees or prescribes rates. Since July 2003 notaries have been free to establish their own fees. Maximum rate caps fixed by authorities now apply only to family law services in certain circumstances.

== Quebec (Canada) ==
A Quebec notary, or &quot;notaire&quot;, is a highly specialized lawyer in private practice appointed as a public officer that takes part in the administration of justice. A notary is also a legal adviser.

The mission of notaries, in their capacity as a public officer, is to execute acts which the parties wish or are required to endow with the authenticity attaching to acts of public authority, to provide such acts with a fixed date, and to keep all acts executed &quot;en minute&quot; in their notarial records and issue copies of or extracts from them.

In their role as a public officer, notaries are duty-bound to act impartially and to advise all parties to an act which the parties wish or are required to endow with authenticity.

Notaries have a monopoly on marital property systems, estate administration, and conveyancing (realty sales, mortgages, etc.) and give legal advices regarding noncontentious matters.

Studies

* Notaries earn undergraduate law degrees (&quot;Baccalauréat en droit (LL.B.)&quot; or &quot;Licence en droit (LL.L.&quot;)) from an accredited Canadian Civil Law school.
* Law graduates must then earn a master&#x27;s degree in notarial law (LL.M.) (&quot;Maîtrise en droit notarial&quot;) which specialized in contract laws, advanced tax law, business law, conflict of laws, real estate law, city planning and environmental law, dispute prevention and resolution, and estate planning. To graduate, students must complete 54 postgraduate credits, which include an 80-day internship and practice seminars.
* LL.M. graduates must then enroll at the notary institute (&quot;Chambre des notaires du Québec)&quot; and pass professional exams. Notaries are also required to attend regular continuing education courses and seminars.

==Spain==
In Spain, a &quot;notario&quot; is both a civil servant and a private and highly specialised lawyer. Thus, although they hold a private practice, depending on the role they professionally exercise they may be acting as public officers (for instance, when working with governmental agencies and departments, or when certifying notarial instruments in a court of law) or as private practitioners (for instance, when paying their own staff&#x27;s taxes and salaries, or assuming the running costs of their own notarial practice). Spanish notaries are charged with writing and authorising notarial instruments that gather either perceptible facts from which some legal right might be derived (for instance, holding witness, or validating a document), or juridical business of any sort both in private and commercial law that in one way or another require collecting the will of all parties involved, as would be for instance mortgage contracts or powers of attorney (&quot;poder notarial&quot;).

Notaries are regulated by the &quot;Ley de 28 de mayo de 1862 del Notariado de España&quot; (Spanish Notaries Act 1862). Access to the profession is restricted to Spanish and EU citizens over the age of 23, and who hold a law graduate degrees (or, rarely, a doctorate in law). In order to become a notary, the candidate has to sit a highly competitive public examination consisting of 4 parts covering all legal and practical aspects of Spanish private law. This &quot;oposición pública&quot; is usually called once a year to cover arising vacancies in the notarial jurisdictions. Because very few openings take place, the success rate for this exam is extremely low (under 1% earn a position), and preparing for the examination typically takes potential candidates 2 to 5 years.

Spanish notaries exercise their notarial instruments (known in general as &quot;fe pública notarial&quot;) in a dual manner: 
# When discussing matters of fact, what a Spanish notary sees, hears, or perceives is held to have full evidentiary value and executory force, and is, therefore, proof of the fact. 
# When discussing matters of the Law, notarial instruments hold the authenticity and probative force of the wills declared by the parties appearing in it.
As private practitioners, Spanish notaries are also obliged by law to offer legal counsel to all those that may require or demand it, and advise them on the most appropriate legal means they may need to reach their goals, so long as the latter are licit.

Unlike in common law jurisdictions, Spanish notaries are actively involved in drafting the notarial instruments and contracts, usually (if so needed) as advised by the signing parties. In that manner, they act as private practitioners. However, inasmuch as public officers, notaries are obliged to ensure that the notarial instruments and contracts are law abiding, and upon notarising the instrument (&quot;calificación notarial&quot;), the instrument has the full power of the law. Because of this, the validity and truthfulness of notarial instruments are a priori held to be true, and therefore had probative value in the Courts, were disputes to arise.

The three main notarial instruments a Spanish notary holds are:
# &quot;Escrituras públicas&quot; (public-form instruments), which refer to all contracts and declarations that involve the assent of two or more parties. This includes house deeds, 
# &quot;Actas notariales&quot; (private-form instruments). These are notarial statements, whereby the notary bears witness to something he or she has physically been part of. They may be employed by lawyers requiring an independent third party (the notary) to witness something (the presence of some individual somewhere, or the drawing of a specific prize by lot, the validity of a translation...).
# &quot;Pólizas intervenidas&quot; (intervened policies). These are typically commercial contracts such as mortgage and insurance policies, where one of the parties grants some right (say, a loan) to another.
Finally, Spanish notaries offer engrossments and certifications, e.g. copy certifications. Notaries execute and stamp ‘dar fe’ (giving faith) on each page of the notarial instrument, which are bound together with their archival number and page, and held in a protocol (&quot;practice&quot;). The notarial instrument is always written on certified paper (&quot;papel timbrado&quot;), special paper issued and numbered by the Royal Mint, and bound alongside all other notarial instruments yearly to be archived by the notary&#x27;s protocol. The minute copy (&quot;matriz&quot;) must be physically held by the notary. The notary may issue exemplified copies of the minute having the same validity as the latter.

Notarial practices are limited by law to a specific practice location where the notary typically has his or her law office (&quot;notaría&quot;). Each notary&#x27;s office is held by a notary sole, and tends to employ a number of clerks (&quot;pasantes&quot;) and administrators. These offices are private practices, and are self-funded with the fees that the notary is allowed to charge. Notaries&#x27; fees are regulated by law. Each notarial instrument has a moderate cost on its own, added to which the notary charges per page drafted, per copy emitted, etc., a legally set amount. The notary is also obliged to collect whichever taxes may be involved in the transactions they notarise (for instance, the stamp duty or VAT costs).

===Latin America===
Although regulated in a different manner in each country, notaries in the Spanish Americas operate in a very similar manner to Spanish notaries.

==Other countries==
As a general rule, countries who formerly were colonies or viceroyalties of Spain, France or Portugal, have retained a civil law tradition and, accordingly, a civil-law notarial profession. This is the case with most Latin American and French-speaking African countries, but not so of Asian countries.

===The International Union of Notaries===
Most of the countries which have civil-law notaries are members of the International Union of Notaries (UINL). Members include:
; Europe (35)
: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the United Kingdom (only the City of London), Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Macedonia, The Vatican, Turkey and Ukraine.
; Americas (24)
: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico (United States), Louisiana (United States), Quebec (Canada), Uruguay, and Venezuela.

; Asia (3)
: Bangladesh, China (People&#x27;s Republic), Indonesia, Japan.

The members of the union are represented by their respective national councils or by similar national organisations and by notarial districts and regional or provincial societies of notaries.

The UINL has preferential relations with professional legal officers who fulfil notarial duties in various countries (or federated states within a federation) or with the bodies that represent them.

The countries that have asked to join the union are: Georgia, Mauritius, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Serbia, the Seychelles, South Korea, Tunisia, and Vietnam.

The federated states that have asked to join the union are: Alabama, British Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas.

==History==

===Origins===
Scribes have existed since recorded history, but the notary&#x27;s authentication tools were first invented in the Fertile Crescent where in Babylon the use of signatures and distinct signs in clay tablets was required. Egypt innovated the use of papyrus and the calame, added legalistic formalism to document preparation, and had specialized notary-scribes, called &quot;sesh n pero&quot;&#x27; &quot;pharaoh&#x27;s scribe&quot; or &quot;sesh n po&quot; &quot;scribe of the nome&quot;—&quot;agoranomos&quot; in Ptolemaic times—who gave authenticity to instruments without the need for witnesses. In Ancient Israel there existed a similar institution of the notary-scribe known as the &quot;sofér&quot;. Greek city-states lacked uniformity, but, universally, public instruments, usually deeds and conveyances, were kept in official registers and drafted by scribal (or &quot;king&#x27;s scribes&quot;) who were tied to a certain district and whose written acts trumped oral testimony. These innovations would be combined and adopted under the Roman Empire.

===Roman Empire===
In Rome, scribes (&quot;scribae&quot;) acted as court recorders and copyists of instruments, whereas the &quot;notarius&quot; took dictation and raw minutes or memoranda (&quot;notae&quot;) of proceedings in shorthand. Different kinds of &quot;notarius&quot; existed: some recorded proceedings, others transcribed state papers, some supplied magistrates with legal forms, and others registered judgements and decrees. A number were involved with the noncontentious jurisdiction of the courts by drawing up deeds, wills, and conveyances which could then be sealed before the presiding magistrate and affixed with the official seal of the court, thereby rendering them public and probative acts. Otherwise, most instruments were in private form. One type of &quot;notarius&quot; was the &quot;exceptor&quot; who emerged as the official clerk attached to all bureaus and courts and required at all municipal meetings of &quot;curiae&quot;.

Yet, drawing up private documents was more the preserve of the &quot;tabellio&quot;, a professional scrivener who held no public office. The &quot;tabellio&quot; used clerks to take shorthand notes and wrote them out in minute form. This was then engrossed into an extended act, duly attested by witnesses and endorsed with a &quot;completio&quot;, or eschatocol (docquet). Early on and like the &quot;notarius&quot;, a &quot;tabellio&quot;&#x27;s instrument lacked probativity. Only by attaching copies of the judicial proceedings wherein one party petitions the second party to either contest or accept the act in open court could the instrument be made probative, i.e., imbued with &quot;fides publica&quot;, &quot;public faith and credit&quot;. In later years, it became possible to register and deposit the acts of a &quot;tabellio&quot; in public archives to make them probative. Both &quot;exceptores&quot; and &quot;tabelliones&quot; were organized into civil guilds (&quot;collegia, scholae&quot;) to ensure the official recording of both public and private acts. Though &quot;tabelliones&quot; were of lower social status, the position had high mobility, and official posts often drew young nobles.

By the Late Roman period, &quot;notarius&quot; came to denote registrars attached to the courts of provincial governors, secretaries of emperors, and the highest class of officials in the privy council and the imperial chancery. In the Church, they were administrative secretaries for bishops and monasteries and were important as correspondents in the doctrinal battles of the 3rd and 4th centuries. Constantine himself created guilds of &quot;notarii&quot; for bishops and their courts. &quot;Tabelliones&quot; were nicknamed &quot;runners&quot; &quot;(cursores)&quot; because of their quick drafting speed and their &quot;cursive&quot; minute hand. They were also sometimes known as &quot;forenses&quot; and &quot;publici&quot;—from their presence in public places—before being subsumed under the functions of the , or notary-clerk. Lawyers—or or —also often acted as scriveners.

===Early Middle Ages===
With the degeneration of public administration and its assumption by the Church in the West, as well as the replacement of Roman legal writing culture with a Germanic oral legal system based on witness testimony and open court proceedings, secular scribes and scriveners became obsolete. In a select group of urban areas, such as in northern Italy and southern France, Roman law tended to be preserved, at least for civil matters, and there the secular &quot;notarius&quot; or &quot;tabellio&quot; lived on mostly as a scrivener. Ecclesiastical notaries () in the main perfected a number of common notarial devices, namely the use of ribbons, seals, manual signs (&quot;signum&quot;), and the form of the eschatocol during this time. They also came to be called &quot;scrinarius&quot;. Pope Gregory the Great (r. 590–604) organized papal &quot;notarii&quot; or &quot;scrinarii&quot; into a &quot;schola&quot;; Gregory&#x27;s registers show that they were responsible for recording correspondence, ordinations, privileges, donations, synodal acts, and matters related to the Patrimony of Saint Peter, as well as serving as papal advisors, diplomats, and envoys. Similarly, the papal chancery, archive, and library were organized around their efforts.

In northern Italy during the Ostrogothic and Lombard periods, the offices of &quot;exceptor&quot; and &quot;tabellio&quot; were carried out by scriptores and notaries. The &quot;notarius civitatis&quot;, or ‘urban notary’, served Lombard kings and nobles in their courts; continued to aid bishops, abbots, and some of the public. These two kinds of notaries attended the same episcopal schools, and the existence of ecclesiastical notaries led to the demand for secular ones. Unorganized and unregulated &quot;publici notarii&quot;, or ‘lay notaries’, handled private matters, since the Lombards did not practice &quot;insinuation&quot;. From the late 7th century on, important notaries’ societies (and probably notarial education) existed in Pavia, Cremona, Milan, Lucca, Rome, and Ravenna.

In Merovingian France, ecclesiastical notaries, continuing Late Imperial practice, were attached to county courts as clerks of court who recorded proceedings and prepared and engrossed instruments and process which were later sealed before the count with the court&#x27;s official seal to render them public and authentic. Otherwise, it was not until the 9th century, when Charlemagne, in an effort to reform the county court system, began to appoint notaries to accompany itinerant royal commissioners during their assize circuit, which notaries were called royal notaries. By the 10th century, they had become permanent clerks of court and came to greatly outnumber and then absorb the comital notaries into their corps. This system was preserved by the Holy Roman Empire.

Charlemagne also raised ecclesiastical notaries to the status of deacon or priest. As a result, the Office of notary became a stepping-stone to higher church office. They continued to serve the public as well before being made obsolete by the full emergence of a lay notarial profession in the 12th century. Charlemagne ordered that every bishop, abbot, and count employ a notary, appointed by himself if necessary. He therefore accepted and altered Lombard practice, formalized it, and spread it to the rest of the empire. His own notarial secretaries were the &quot;cancellarii&quot;. One notary in particular, Paul the Deacon, played a pivotal role in the Carolingian Renaissance. Paul was trained at Pavia, was chancellor to the Lombard king Desierius, taught at the Frankish palace school (782–787), and may have been responsible for reforming the notarial system. The famous &quot;missi dominici&quot; oversaw the work of comital (counts&#x27;) and episcopal notaries, who, under Louis the Pious, were drawn specifically from the noble class. Under Lothair I, imperial law regulated notarial practice of both episcopal and comital &quot;cancellarii&quot; and private notaries and limited a notary&#x27;s geographic jurisdiction.

===Byzantine Europe===
In the East, however, the tabularius, called &quot;symbolaiographos&quot; and the juris, the &quot;nomikos&quot;, continued to thrive. To stem fraud, Justinian reforms codified (cf. 44th and 77th novellae) new precautionary measures for giving a document probativity such as:
* the actual presence of the attesting tabellio and the recording of other witnesses&#x27; names,
* the obligatory presence and signatures of witnesses to an act&#x27;s signing
* dating by regnal and consular year and indiction
* inclusion of an eschatocol in which the tabellio claimed responsibility for the document
* recitation before a judge before recordation, a process known as &quot;insinuatio&quot;.
Some measures proved untenable and, with the short supply of administrators and half loss of the Empire (early 7th century), notaries became a primarily urban phenomenon with somewhat relaxed standards of practice. Still, they remained the highest-ranking lawyer and instrumental to the legal and court process as Germanic-type oral proceedings were unknown and Roman legalistic traditions survived intact. From the mid-6th century, a large body of centuries-old legal texts was given force of law and became widely circulated. Similarly, the importance of law court officials declined as did lawsuits in regular civil courts and this, in turn, allowed private settlements mediated by notaries at lower cost to flourish.

In time, all notarial functions (clerical and law officer) were concentrated into the law-trained &quot;nomikos&quot;, though the Church would provide notarial services in town and rural settings. The Church also retained the old separation between &quot;symbolaiographos&quot;, or notary-draftsman, &quot;notarios&quot;, or notary-scribe, and the clerical &quot;nomikos&quot;, or notary lawyer. By the 10th century, secular nomikoi had been organized into a regulatory guild, were attached to the State, appointed by the Emperor, and ranked among the highest of legal officers. The introductory portions of their acts also tended to invoke God, and crosses and Christian insignia were often applied to the face of an act. Notarial practice would be slightly westernized under Venetian occupation, but remained substantially unchanged until the end of the Empire.

===Late Middle Ages===

Imperial Ravenna retained separate scholae of imperial notaries, ecclesiastical notaries, and tabelliones. However, with the fall of the Exarchate, imperial notaries disappeared with unauthorized tabelliones absorbing most of their legal jurisdiction and function. During the 11th century and the early 12th century, attempts to bring the tabellionate under imperial purview were resisted and failed at Ravenna, though by the 13th century many professionals styled themselves &quot;notarius et tabellio&quot;, combining both functions in their practice. By the 13th century, even the Ravennati adopted the title &quot;notary by imperial authority,&quot; and the retrograde tabellionate slowly dissolved. The ecclesiastical notariate in Ravenna retained its position until the 12th century, but did not interfere in the sphere of the secular notariate. During the 12th century, the lay tabellionate absorbed most of the functions of the church notary, even running Ravenna&#x27;s episcopal chancery by 1127. Elsewhere in Italy, where it had survived, the independent ecclesiastical notariate likewise slowly disappeared: in Lucca, the comital notariate replaced it during the Carolingian period; and in Bologna, home of the revived imperial legal tradition, the bishop&#x27;s last clerical notary died in 1133. Even in Rome, lay notaries gained in importance, and in 1211 Pope Innocent III declared that no notary in a church court could hold major orders.

In southern Italy, when Sicily fell to the Arabs it lost the notarial tradition, while other areas, such as Apulia, Calabria, and Lucania, held on to Greco-Byzantine practices. Areas retaining the Latin-Lombard traditions used the &quot;notarius&quot;, but he may have been attached to and authorized through a palace, church, monastery, or even city; or sometimes he was itinerant and without official authority. During the 10th century, Naples maintained a clear organization of notaries (&quot;curiali&quot;) in a &quot;collegio&quot; under a &quot;primarius&quot; aided by a &quot;tabularius&quot;. Documents were often drawn up by &quot;discipuli&quot; (&quot;apprentices&quot;), but only the notary could apply the eschatocol. Amalfi followed a looser organization: &quot;scribae civitatis&quot; (&quot;scriveners&quot;) were called &quot;curiali&quot; by c. 1000, many may have worked only part-time, and there was no clear caste of &quot;discipuli&quot;. Gaeta retained the &quot;scriba civitatis&quot;, though mixing Greek with Latin traditions and clerical with secular functions and statuses. In the 10th and 11th centuries, titles included &quot;presbyter&quot; (&quot;priest&quot;) &quot;et notarius civitatis&quot; and &quot;Leo greco-latinus presbyter et scriba civitatis&quot;, though by the early 12th century a simple &quot;notarius civitatis&quot; would do. The southern Italian tradition was for the most part replaced by the Carolingian tradition when the region was conquered by the Normans.

As northern Italy came to free itself in the late 11th century from imperial rule and episcopal authority, it established municipal authorities (known as &quot;consulates&quot;) who, with the increase in literacy, came to rely heavily on the lay notary to produce, archive, and standardize public instruments under municipal seal. In addition, the Venetian pillaging of Byzantine libraries revived bookish learning and led to the founding of law schools, such as at the University of Bologna which trained notaries-at-law. Similarly, as schools for notaries relied on Byzantine law and came to determine the development of the notarial corps, by the 10th century, the Carolingian and the Byzantine traditions were no longer distinguishable. The Italian notarial profession was transmitted from Lombardy to southern France through trade, first to Languedoc, and eventually northward to Bruges (Flemish Belgium), and on to the eastern Mediterranean.

==Distinction from American notaries public==
Save for Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, a civil-law notary should not be confused with a notary public in the United States and Canada, who has none of the legal powers notaries enjoy at civil law. Rather, notaries public only have the power to administer oaths, take affidavits, declarations or depositions from witnesses, acknowledge and attest signatures, and certify copies, usually in conjunction with some legal process. The same does not apply to notaries public in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and many other Common Law countries. There the notary public is a lawyer and often holds a secondary legal qualification, such as solicitor or barrister. The aspiring Notary Public usually has to take additional exams or undertake post graduate study to become a notary public. In Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Quebec, private law is traditionally based on the French and Spanish civil codes, giving notaries greater legal powers, including the right to prepare wills, conveyances and generally all contracts and instruments in writing. For this reason, immigrants from civil-law countries where civil-law notaries exist, particularly those from Latin America, are often confused by the office of notary public and have been defrauded by dishonest notaries misrepresenting themselves as having legal powers. Thus, in some states, there have been ongoing efforts to prohibit notaries public from listing themselves as &quot;notario público&quot;. Such a law has existed for more than fifteen years in California. Similar laws now exist in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee and Texas.

Florida (1997) and Alabama (1999) have enacted statutes and regulations, based on the Model Civil Law Notary Act, allowing for the appointment of Florida or Alabama attorneys as civil-law notaries with the power to authenticate documents, facts and transactions. This is not the same as a notary public appointment. Attorneys with a minimum of 5 years of Bar membership are appointed after specialized training and state examination. Acts of Florida and Alabama civil-law notaries are given both domestic and international effect under their enabling statutes. A civil law notary statute was proposed in Illinois in 2002, but was not enacted into law.

<doc id="215987" wikidata="Q419170" url="?curid=215987" title="Iron(III) oxide">
<text>Iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula . It occurs in nature as the mineral hematite, which serves as the primary source of iron for the steel industry. It is also known as red iron oxide, especially when used in pigments.

It is one of the three main oxides of iron, the other two being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare; and iron(II,III) oxide (), which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite. 

Iron(III) oxide is often called rust, since rust shares several properties and has a similar composition; however, in chemistry, rust is considered an ill-defined material, described as hydrous ferric oxide.

Ferric oxide is readily attacked by even weak acids. It is a weak oxidising agent, most famously when reduced by aluminium in the thermite reaction.

==Structure==
 can be obtained in various polymorphs. In the primary polymorph, α, iron adopts octahedral coordination geometry. That is, each Fe center is bound to six oxygen ligands. In the γ polymorph, some of the Fe sit on tetrahedral sites, with four oxygen ligands.

===Alpha phase===
α- has the rhombohedral, corundum (α-Al2O3) structure and is the most common form. It occurs naturally as the mineral hematite, which is mined as the main ore of iron. It is antiferromagnetic below ~260 K (Morin transition temperature), and exhibits weak ferromagnetism between 260 K and the Néel temperature, 950 K. It is easy to prepare using both thermal decomposition and precipitation in the liquid phase. Its magnetic properties are dependent on many factors, e.g., pressure, particle size, and magnetic field intensity.

===Gamma phase===
γ-Fe2O3 has a cubic structure. It is metastable and converted from the alpha phase at high temperatures. It occurs naturally as the mineral maghemite. It is ferromagnetic and finds application in recording tapes, although ultrafine particles smaller than 10 nanometers are superparamagnetic. It can be prepared by thermal dehydratation of gamma iron(III) oxide-hydroxide. Another method involves the careful oxidation of iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4). The ultrafine particles can be prepared by thermal decomposition of iron(III) oxalate.

===Other solid phases===
Several other phases have been identified or claimed. The beta phase (β-phase) is cubic body-centered (space group Ia3), metastable, and at temperatures above converts to alpha phase. It can be prepared by reduction of hematite by carbon, pyrolysis of iron(III) chloride solution, or thermal decomposition of iron(III) sulfate.

The epsilon (ε) phase is rhombic, and shows properties intermediate between alpha and gamma, and may have useful magnetic properties applicable for purposes such as high density recording media for big data storage. Preparation of the pure epsilon phase has proven very challenging. Material with a high proportion of epsilon phase can be prepared by thermal transformation of the gamma phase. The epsilon phase is also metastable, transforming to the alpha phase at between . It can also be prepared by oxidation of iron in an electric arc or by sol-gel precipitation from iron(III) nitrate. Research has revealed epsilon iron(III) oxide in ancient Chinese Jian ceramic glazes, which may provide insight into ways to produce that form in the lab.

Additionally, at high pressure an amorphous form is claimed.

===Liquid phase===
Molten is expected to have a coordination number of close to 5 oxygen atoms about each iron atom, based on measurements of slightly oxygen deficient supercooled liquid iron oxide droplets, where supercooling circumvents the need for the high oxygen pressures required above the melting point to maintain stoichiometry.

==Hydrated iron(III) oxides==
Several hydrates of Iron(III) oxide exist.
When alkali is added to solutions of soluble Fe(III) salts, a red-brown gelatinous precipitate forms. This is &quot;not&quot; , but (also written as ).

Several forms of the hydrated oxide of Fe(III) exist as well. The red lepidocrocite (γ-) occurs on the outside of rusticles, and the orange goethite (α-) occurs internally in rusticles.
When ·H2O is heated, it loses its water of hydration. Further heating at converts to black (), which is known as the mineral magnetite.

 is soluble in acids, giving . In concentrated aqueous alkali, gives .

==Reactions==
The most important reaction is its carbothermal reduction, which gives iron used in steel-making:

Another redox reaction is the extremely exothermic thermite reaction with aluminium.

This process is used to weld thick metals such as rails of train tracks by using a ceramic container to funnel the molten iron in between two sections of rail. Thermite is also used in weapons and making small-scale cast-iron sculptures and tools.

Partial reduction with hydrogen at about produces magnetite, a black magnetic material that contains both Fe(III) and Fe(II):

Iron(III) oxide is insoluble in water but dissolves readily in strong acid, e.g., hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. It also dissolves well in solutions of chelating agents such as EDTA and oxalic acid.

Heating iron(III) oxides with other metal oxides or carbonates yields materials known as ferrates (ferrate (III)):


==Preparation==
Iron(III) oxide is a product of the oxidation of iron. It can be prepared in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate, an inert electrolyte, with an iron anode:

The resulting hydrated iron(III) oxide, written here as , dehydrates around .

==Uses==

===Iron industry===
The overwhelming application of iron(III) oxide is as the feedstock of the steel and iron industries, e.g., the production of iron, steel, and many alloys. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) has been used in stained glass since the medieval period, with evidence suggesting its use in stained glass production dating back to the early Middle Ages, where it was primarily used to create yellow, orange, and red colors in the glass, still being used for industrial purposes today.

===Polishing===
A very fine powder of ferric oxide is known as &quot;jeweler&#x27;s rouge&quot;, &quot;red rouge&quot;, or simply rouge. It is used to put the final polish on metallic jewelry and lenses, and historically as a cosmetic. Rouge cuts more slowly than some modern polishes, such as cerium(IV) oxide, but is still used in optics fabrication and by jewelers for the superior finish it can produce. When polishing gold, the rouge slightly stains the gold, which contributes to the appearance of the finished piece. Rouge is sold as a powder, paste, laced on polishing cloths, or solid bar (with a wax or grease binder). Other polishing compounds are also often called &quot;rouge&quot;, even when they do not contain iron oxide. Jewelers remove the residual rouge on jewelry by use of ultrasonic cleaning. Products sold as &quot;stropping compound&quot; are often applied to a leather strop to assist in getting a razor edge on knives, straight razors, or any other edged tool.

===Pigment===

Iron(III) oxide is also used as a pigment, under names &quot;Pigment Brown 6&quot;, &quot;Pigment Brown 7&quot;, and &quot;Pigment Red 101&quot;. Some of them, e.g., Pigment Red 101 and Pigment Brown 6, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cosmetics. Iron oxides are used as pigments in dental composites alongside titanium oxides.

Hematite is the characteristic component of the Swedish paint color Falu red.

===Magnetic recording===
Iron(III) oxide was the most common magnetic particle used in all types of magnetic storage and recording media, including magnetic disks (for data storage) and magnetic tape (used in audio and video recording as well as data storage). Its use in computer disks was superseded by cobalt alloy, enabling thinner magnetic films with higher storage density.

===Photocatalysis===
α- has been studied as a photoanode for solar water oxidation. However, its efficacy is limited by a short diffusion length (2–4 nm) of photo-excited charge carriers and subsequent fast recombination, requiring a large overpotential to drive the reaction. Research has been focused on improving the water oxidation performance of using nanostructuring, surface functionalization, or by employing alternate crystal phases such as β-.

===Medicine===
Calamine lotion, used to treat mild itchiness, is chiefly composed of a combination of zinc oxide, acting as astringent, and about 0.5% iron(III) oxide, the product&#x27;s active ingredient, acting as antipruritic. The red color of iron(III) oxide is also mainly responsible for the lotion&#x27;s pink color.

<text>Hainina is an extinct mammal genus from the latest Cretaceous to the Paleocene of Europe. 

== Genus ==
The genus &quot;Hainina&quot; (&quot;from Hainin&quot;) was named by Vianey-Liaud M. in 1979. This genus was originally referred to as Cimolomyidae. &quot;We assign &quot;Hainina&quot; to the Kogaionidae (superfamily &quot;incertae sedis&quot;); it differs from &quot;Kogaionon&quot; in having ornamented enamel, while the enamel is smooth in &quot;Kogaionon&quot;&quot;. Material has also been reported from the Upper Cretaceous of Romania.

<text>Anthony Schmalz Conrad (March 7, 1940 – April 9, 2016) was an American video artist, experimental filmmaker, musician, composer, sound artist, teacher, and writer. Active in a variety of media since the early 1960s, he was a pioneer of both drone music and structural film. As a musician, he was an important figure in the New York minimalist scene of the 1960s, during which time he performed as part of the Theatre of Eternal Music (along with John Cale, La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, Terry Riley, and others). He became recognized as a filmmaker for his 1966 film &quot;The Flicker&quot;. He performed and collaborated with a wide range of artists over the course of his career. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Conrad was born in Concord, New Hampshire, to Mary Elizabeth Parfitt and Arthur Emil Conrad, and raised in Baldwin, Maryland and Northern Virginia. His father worked with Everett Warner during World War II in designing dazzle camouflage for the United States Navy. Conrad&#x27;s high school violin lessons with symphony violist Ronald Knudsen introduced him to just intonation and double stop playing. After briefly studying violin at Baltimore&#x27;s Peabody Conservatory, Conrad graduated from Harvard University in 1962 with a degree in mathematics. While studying at Harvard, Conrad was exposed to the ideas of experimental composers John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. After working as a computer programmer, Conrad became involved in New York City&#x27;s avant-garde arts scene.

===1960s===

After moving to New York, Conrad became an early member of La Monte Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music alongside John Cale, Angus MacLise, and Marian Zazeela. The Theatre of Eternal Music utilized just intonation and drones to produce what the group called &quot;dream music&quot;; Conrad&#x27;s mathematical knowledge contributed to the Theatre&#x27;s systematization of just intervals, and he also encouraged the ensemble to adopt electronic amplification. Conrad would later leave the Theatre in a dispute over Young&#x27;s attempt to assert more deliberate compositional influence over their performances and refusal to grant him or Cale shared credit for the ensemble&#x27;s music or access to its recordings, and in 1990 protested a concert by his former bandleader with a manifesto titled &quot;Composer La Monte Young Does Not Understand &#x27;His&#x27; Work&quot; outlining his grievances and accusing Young of &quot;orientalism and [a] romanticized personality cult mark[ing] him among the most regressive of contemporary artists.&quot;

In 1963, he joined his former Harvard classmate and Fluxus associate Henry Flynt in his anti-art demonstrations against &quot;elitist&quot; New York cultural institutions.

In 1964, Conrad and Cale were recruited by Pickwick Records to serve as a backing band, The Primitives, to perform the Lou Reed-penned single &quot;The Ostrich&quot;/&quot;Sneaky Pete&quot;. Conrad and Cale played guitar and bass, Walter de Maria played percussion, and Reed sang. Conrad and Cale&#x27;s instruments were tuned to Reed&#x27;s &quot;Ostrich tuning&quot;, with every string the same pitch class. After the Primitives disbanded, Cale and Reed formed The Velvet Underground. Conrad was indirectly responsible for the name of The Velvet Underground, although he was never a member of the group; after moving into Conrad&#x27;s old apartment on Ludlow Street in New York City, Reed and Cale found a copy of &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; which Conrad had left in the apartment, and took its name for the band.

=== 1970s ===
Conrad&#x27;s first musical release under his own name was a collaboration with Faust, &quot;Outside the Dream Syndicate&quot;, released by Caroline in 1973. This remains his best known musical work and is considered a classic of minimalist music and drone music.

One of Conrad&#x27;s early films was &quot;Coming Attractions&quot;, made with his then-partner Beverly Grant, which was released in 1970. This film led indirectly to the founding of Syntonic Research and the Environments series of natural sound recordings. Grant and Conrad further worked on two films: &quot;Straight and Narrow&quot; (1970) and &quot;Four Square&quot; (1971).

&quot;Yellow Movies&quot; was a project of Conrad&#x27;s in 1973 of twenty &quot;movies&quot; consisting of rectangular borders painted in black house paint on large pieces of photographic paper, effectively framing each sizable expanse of emulsion whereby the physical aging and transformation of the emulsion itself would constitute a definitively slow-motion moving picture over such an extended period of time.

Conrad began to work in video and performance in the 1970s as a professor at Antioch College, where he replaced the filmmaker Paul Sharits. In 1976, Conrad joined the faculty at the Center for Media Studies at the University at Buffalo. While in Buffalo, Conrad was part of a scene that included Sharits, as well as Hollis Frampton, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Peter Weibel, James Blue, Cathy Steffan and Gerald O&#x27;Grady. Their practices in film, video, performance, and other forms were documented in the 2008 book &quot;Buffalo Heads: Media Study, Media Practice, Media Pioneers, 1973–1990&quot;, edited by Vasulka and Weibel.

In the mid-1970s, Conrad began performing film. With &quot;Sukiyaki Film&quot; he decided that the film should be prepared immediately before viewing. Sukiyaki was chosen as the paradigm for the work because it is a dish often cooked immediately before eating, in front of the diners. Conrad cooked sukiyaki in front of an audience: egg, meat, vegetables, and 16mm film; and literally &quot;projected&quot; onto the screen behind him.

===Later life===
Table of the Elements released a number of Conrad&#x27;s archival recordings in the 1990s and 2000s, including &quot;Four Violins (1964)&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Glissando&quot;, and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. &quot;Slapping Pythagoras&quot;, an album of new music commissioned by Table of the Elements, was recorded with Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Steve Albini at Electrical Audio and released in 1995. &quot;Early Minimalism, Vol. 1&quot;, released in 1997, was an attempt to reconstruct the sound of Theatre of Eternal Music recordings withheld by La Monte Young.&quot;&quot; He also issued two archival CDs featuring the work of late New York filmmaker Jack Smith, with whom he was associated in the 1960s.

Conrad collaborated with artists such as Charlemagne Palestine, Genesis P-Orridge, Keiji Haino, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, David Grubbs, C Spencer Yeh, Tovah Olson, MV Carbon, and numerous others. Conrad was chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that they curated in May 2011. In 2012 Conrad was part of the line-up of the touring avant-garde festival Sonic Protest that took place in five cities in France. In 2013 Conrad visited Genoa to open his first solo exhibition in Italy.
Conrad&#x27;s work has been shown at many museums including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City; the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis; the Louvre in Paris; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; and many others. Specifically, his film &quot;The Flicker&quot; was included in the Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s exhibition, &quot;The American Century&quot;; he participated in the 2006 Whitney Biennial; and one of his &quot;Yellow Paintings&quot; was featured in the museum&#x27;s 2015–2016 exhibition &quot;Collected by Thea Westreich Wagner and Ethan Wagner&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Conrad&#x27;s artwork is represented by Greene Naftali Gallery in New York City, and by Galerie Buchholz in Germany.

Conrad had been a faculty member in the State University of New York at Buffalo since 1976, and continued to teach there in the Department of Media Study until his death. Several of his students at Buffalo formed the indie rock band Mercury Rev in 1989.

==Death==
Conrad died at a hospice in Cheektowaga, New York, on April 9, 2016, after receiving treatment for prostate cancer.

The Tony Conrad estate is represented by Greene Naftali, New York, and Galerie Bucholz, Cologne.

<text>The Hundred Days ( ), also known as the War of the Seventh Coalition (), marked the period between Napoleon&#x27;s return from eleven months of exile on the island of Elba to Paris on20 March 1815 and the second restoration of King Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815 (a period of 110 days). This period saw the War of the Seventh Coalition, and includes the Waterloo Campaign and the Neapolitan War as well as several other minor campaigns. The phrase &quot;les Cent Jours&quot; (the Hundred Days) was first used by the prefect of Paris, Gaspard, comte de Chabrol, in his speech welcoming the king back to Paris on 8 July.

Napoleon returned while the Congress of Vienna was sitting. On 13 March, seven days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared him an outlaw, and on 25 March, Austria, Prussia, Russia and the United Kingdom, the four Great Powers and key members of the Seventh Coalition, bound themselves to put 150,000 men each into the field to end his rule. This set the stage for the last conflict in the Napoleonic Wars, the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the second restoration of the French kingdom, and the permanent exile of Napoleon to the distant island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.
==Background==

===Napoleon&#x27;s rise and fall===
The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars pitted France against various coalitions of other European nations nearly continuously from 1792 onward. The overthrow and subsequent public execution of Louis XVI in France had greatly disturbed other European leaders, who vowed to crush the French Republic. Rather than leading to France&#x27;s defeat, the wars allowed the revolutionary regime to expand beyond its borders and create client republics. The success of the French forces made a hero out of their best commander, Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1799, Napoleon staged a successful coup d&#x27;état and became First Consul of the new French Consulate. Five years later, he crowned himself Emperor Napoleon I.

The rise of Napoleon troubled the other European powers as much as the earlier revolutionary regime had. Despite the formation of new coalitions against him, Napoleon&#x27;s forces continued to conquer much of Europe. The tide of war began to turn after a disastrous French invasion of Russia in 1812 that resulted in the loss of much of Napoleon&#x27;s army. The following year, during the War of the Sixth Coalition, Coalition forces defeated the French in the Battle of Leipzig.

Following its victory at Leipzig, the Coalition vowed to press on to Paris and depose Napoleon. In the last week of February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher advanced on Paris. After multiple attacks, manoeuvring, and reinforcements on both sides, Blücher won the Battle of Laon in early March 1814; this victory prevented the coalition army from being pushed north out of France. The Battle of Reims went to Napoleon, but this victory was followed by successive defeats from increasingly overwhelming odds. Coalition forces entered Paris after the Battle of Montmartre on 30 March 1814.

On 6 April 1814, Napoleon abdicated his throne, leading to the accession of Louis XVIII and the first Bourbon Restoration a month later. The defeated Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Tuscany, while the victorious Coalition sought to redraw the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna.

===Exile in Elba===

Napoleon spent only 9 months and 21 days in an uneasy forced retirement on Elba (1814–1815), watching events in France with great interest as the Congress of Vienna gradually gathered. As he foresaw, the shrinkage of the great Empire into the realm of old France caused intense dissatisfaction among the French, a feeling fed by stories of the tactless way in which the Bourbon princes treated veterans of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and the returning royalist nobility treated the people at large. Equally threatening was the general situation in Europe, which had been stressed and exhausted during the previous decades of near constant warfare.

The conflicting demands of major powers were for a time so exorbitant as to bring the Powers at the Congress of Vienna to the verge of war with each other. Thus every scrap of news reaching remote Elba looked favourable to Napoleon to retake power as he correctly reasoned the news of his return would cause a popular rising as he approached. He also reasoned that the return of French prisoners from Russia, Germany, Britain and Spain would furnish him instantly with a trained, veteran and patriotic army far larger than that which had won renown in the years before 1814. So threatening were the symptoms, that the royalists at Paris and the plenipotentiaries at Vienna talked of deporting him to the Azores or to Saint Helena, while others hinted at assassination.

===Congress of Vienna===
At the Congress of Vienna (November 1814 – June 1815) the various participating nations had very different and conflicting goals. Tsar Alexander I of Russia had expected to absorb much of Poland and to leave a Polish puppet state, the Duchy of Warsaw, as a buffer against further invasion from Europe. The renewed Prussian state demanded all of the Kingdom of Saxony. Austria wanted to allow neither of these things, while it expected to regain control of northern Italy. Castlereagh, of the United Kingdom, supported France (represented by Talleyrand) and Austria and was at variance with his own Parliament. This almost caused a war to break out, when the Tsar pointed out to Castlereagh that Russia had 450,000 men near Poland and Saxony and he was welcome to try to remove them. Indeed, Alexander stated &quot;I shall be the King of Poland and the King of Prussia will be the King of Saxony&quot;. Castlereagh approached King Frederick William III of Prussia to offer him British and Austrian support for Prussia&#x27;s annexation of Saxony in return for Prussia&#x27;s support of an independent Poland. The Prussian king repeated this offer in public, offending Alexander so deeply that he challenged Metternich of Austria to a duel. Only the intervention of the Austrian crown stopped it. A breach among the four Great Powers was avoided when members of Britain&#x27;s Parliament sent word to the Russian ambassador that Castlereagh had exceeded his authority, and Britain would not support an independent Poland. The affair left Prussia deeply suspicious of any British involvement.

==Return to France==

While the Allies were distracted, Napoleon solved his problem in characteristic fashion. On 26 February 1815, when the British and French guard ships were absent, his tiny fleet, consisting of the brig &quot;Inconstant&quot;, four small transports, and two feluccas, slipped away from Portoferraio with some 1,000 men and landed at Golfe-Juan, between Cannes and Antibes, on 1 March 1815. Except in royalist Provence, he was warmly received. He avoided much of Provence by taking a route through the Alps, marked today as the &quot;Route Napoléon&quot;.

Firing no shot in his defence, his troop numbers swelled until they became an army. On 5 March, the nominally royalist 5th Infantry Regiment at Grenoble went over to Napoleon &quot;en masse&quot;. The next day they were joined by the 7th Infantry Regiment under its colonel, Charles de la Bédoyère, who would be executed for treason by the Bourbons after the campaign ended. An anecdote illustrates Napoleon&#x27;s charisma: when royalist troops were deployed to stop the march of Napoleon&#x27;s force before Grenoble at Laffrey, Napoleon stepped out in front of them, ripped open his coat and said &quot;If any of you will shoot his Emperor, here I am.&quot; The men joined his cause.

Marshal Ney, now one of Louis XVIII&#x27;s commanders, had said that Napoleon ought to be brought to Paris in an iron cage, but, on 14 March, in Lons-le-Saulnier (Jura) Ney joined Napoleon with a small army of 6,000 men. On 15 March Joachim Murat, King of Naples, declared war on Austria in an attempt to save his throne, starting the Neapolitan War. Four days later, after proceeding through the countryside promising constitutional reform and direct elections to an assembly, to the acclaim of gathered crowds, Napoleon entered the capital, from where Louis XVIII had recently fled. (Ney was arrested on 3 August 1815, tried on 16 November and executed on 7 December 1815.) 

The royalists did not pose a major threat: the duc d&#x27;Angoulême raised a small force in the south, but at Valence it did not provide resistance against Imperialists under Grouchy&#x27;s command; and the duke, on 9 April 1815, signed a convention whereby the royalists received a free pardon from the Emperor. The royalists of the Vendée moved later and caused more difficulty for the Imperialists.

===Napoleon&#x27;s health===
Evidence as to Napoleon&#x27;s health is somewhat conflicting: Carnot, Pasquier, Lavalette, Thiébault and others thought him prematurely aged and enfeebled. At Elba Sir Neil Campbell had noted that he had become inactive and corpulent.
Also at Elba he had begun to suffer intermittently from retention of urine, but to no serious extent.
For much of his public life, Napoleon had been troubled by hemorrhoids, which made sitting on a horse for long periods of time difficult and painful. This condition had disastrous results at Waterloo; during the battle, his inability to sit on his horse for other than very short periods of time interfered with his ability to survey his troops in combat and thus exercise command.
Others reported no marked change in him. Mollien, who knew the emperor well, attributed the lassitude which now and then came over him to a feeling of perplexity caused by his changed circumstances.

===Constitutional reform===

At Lyon, on 13 March 1815, Napoleon issued an edict dissolving the existing chambers and ordering the convocation of a national mass meeting, or Champ de Mai, for the purpose of modifying the constitution of the Napoleonic empire. He reportedly told Benjamin Constant, &quot;I am growing old. The repose of a constitutional king may suit me. It will more surely suit my son&quot;.

That work was carried out by Benjamin Constant in concert with the Emperor. The resulting (supplementary to the &quot;constitutions&quot; of the Empire) bestowed on France a hereditary Chamber of Peers and a Chamber of Representatives elected by the &quot;electoral colleges&quot; of the empire.

According to Chateaubriand, in reference to Louis XVIII&#x27;s constitutional charter, the new constitution – dubbed &quot;La Benjamine&quot; – was merely a &quot;slightly improved&quot; version of the charter associated with Louis XVIII&#x27;s administration; however, later historians, including Agatha Ramm, have pointed out that this constitution permitted the extension of the franchise and explicitly guaranteed press freedom. In the Republican manner, the Constitution was put to the people of France in a plebiscite, but whether due to lack of enthusiasm, or because the nation was suddenly thrown into military preparation, only 1,532,527 votes were cast, less than half of the vote in the plebiscites of the Consulat; however, the benefit of a &quot;large majority&quot; meant that Napoleon felt he had constitutional sanction.

Napoleon was with difficulty dissuaded from quashing the 3 June election of Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais, the staunch liberal who had so often opposed the Emperor, as president of the Chamber of Representatives. In his last communication to them, Napoleon warned them not to imitate the Greeks of the late Byzantine Empire, who engaged in subtle discussions while the ram was battering at their gates.

== Military mobilisation ==

During the Hundred Days the Coalition nations as well as Napoleon mobilised for war. Upon re-assumption of the throne, Napoleon found that Louis XVIII had left him with few resources. There were 56,000 soldiers, of which 46,000 were ready to campaign. By the end of May the total armed forces available to Napoleon had reached 198,000 with 66,000 more in depots training up but not yet ready for deployment. By the end of May Napoleon had formed &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Nord&quot; (the &quot;Army of the North&quot;) which, led by himself, would participate in the Waterloo Campaign.

For the defence of France, Napoleon deployed his remaining forces within France with the intention of delaying his foreign enemies while he suppressed his domestic ones. By June he had organised his forces thus:
* V Corps, – &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Rhin&quot; – commanded by Rapp, cantoned near Strasbourg;
* VII Corps – &quot;L&#x27;Armée des Alpes&quot; – commanded by Suchet, cantoned at Lyon;
* I Corps of Observation – &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Jura&quot; – commanded by Lecourbe, cantoned at Belfort;
* II Corps of Observation – &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Var&quot; – commanded by Brune, based at Toulon;
* III Corps of Observation – Army of the Pyrenees orientales – commanded by Decaen, based at Toulouse;
* IV Corps of Observation – Army of the Pyrenees occidentales – commanded by Clauzel, based at Bordeaux;
* Army of the West, – &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; (also known as the Army of the Vendee and the Army of the Loire) – commanded by Lamarque, was formed to suppress the Royalist insurrection in the Vendée region of France which remained loyal to King Louis XVIII during the Hundred Days.

The opposing Coalition forces were the following:

Archduke Charles gathered Austrian and allied German states, while the Prince of Schwarzenberg formed another Austrian army. King Ferdinand VII of Spain summoned British officers to lead his troops against France. Tsar Alexander I of Russia mustered an army of 250,000 troops and sent these rolling toward the Rhine. Prussia mustered two armies. One under Blücher took post alongside Wellington&#x27;s British army and its allies. The other was the North German Corps under General Kleist.
* Assessed as an immediate threat by Napoleon:
** Anglo-allied, commanded by Wellington, cantoned south-west of Brussels, headquartered at Brussels.
** Prussian Army commanded by Blücher, cantoned south-east of Brussels, headquartered at Namur.
* Close to the borders of France but assessed to be less of a threat by Napoleon:
** The German Corps (North German Federal Army) which was part of Blücher&#x27;s army, but was acting independently south of the main Prussian army. Blücher summoned it to join the main army once Napoleon&#x27;s intentions became known.
** The Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine, commanded by Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg.
** The Swiss Army, commanded by Niklaus Franz von Bachmann.
** The Austrian Army of Upper Italy – Austro-Sardinian Army – commanded by Johann Maria Philipp Frimont.
** The Austrian Army of Naples, commanded by Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza.
* Other coalition forces which were either converging on France, mobilised to defend the homelands, or in the process of mobilisation included:
** A Russian Army, commanded by Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, marching towards France
** A Reserve Russian Army to support Barclay de Tolly if required.
** A Reserve Prussian Army stationed at home in order to defend its borders.
** An Anglo-Sicilian Army under General Sir Hudson Lowe, which was to be landed by the Royal Navy on the southern French coast.
** Two Spanish Armies were assembling and planning to invade over the Pyrenees.
** A Netherlands Corps, under Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, was not present at Waterloo but as a corps in Wellington&#x27;s army it did take part in minor military actions during the Coalition&#x27;s invasion of France.
** A Danish contingent known as the Royal Danish Auxiliary Corps (commanded by General Prince Frederik of Hesse) and a Hanseatic contingent (from the free cities of Bremen, Lübeck and Hamburg) later commanded by the British Colonel Sir Neil Campbell, were on their way to join Wellington; both however, joined the army in July having missed the conflict.
** A Portuguese contingent, which due to the speed of events never assembled.

== War begins ==
At the Congress of Vienna, the Great Powers of Europe (Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia) and their allies , and with the signing of this declaration on 13 March 1815, so began the War of the Seventh Coalition. The hopes of peace that Napoleon had entertained were gone – war was now inevitable.

A further treaty (the ) was ratified on 25 March, in which each of the Great European Powers agreed to pledge 150,000 men for the coming conflict. Such a number was not possible for Great Britain, as her standing army was smaller than those of her three peers. Besides, her forces were scattered around the globe, with many units still in Canada, where the War of 1812 had recently ended. With this in mind, she made up her numerical deficiencies by paying subsidies to the other Powers and to the other states of Europe who would contribute contingents.

Some time after the allies had begun mobilising, it was agreed that the planned invasion of France was to commence on 1 July 1815, much later than both Blücher and Wellington would have liked, as both their armies were ready in June, ahead of the Austrians and Russians; the latter were still some distance away. The advantage of this later invasion date was that it allowed all the invading Coalition armies a chance to be ready at the same time. They could deploy their combined, numerically superior forces against Napoleon&#x27;s smaller, thinly spread forces, thus ensuring his defeat and avoiding a possible defeat within the borders of France. Yet this postponed invasion date allowed Napoleon more time to strengthen his forces and defences, which would make defeating him harder and more costly in lives, time and money.

Napoleon now had to decide whether to fight a defensive or offensive campaign. Defence would entail repeating the 1814 campaign in France, but with much larger numbers of troops at his disposal. France&#x27;s chief cities (Paris and Lyon) would be fortified and two great French armies, the larger before Paris and the smaller before Lyon, would protect them; &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; would be encouraged, giving the Coalition armies their own taste of guerrilla warfare.

Napoleon chose to attack, which entailed a pre-emptive strike at his enemies before they were all fully assembled and able to co-operate. By destroying some of the major Coalition armies, Napoleon believed he would then be able to bring the governments of the Seventh Coalition to the peace table to discuss terms favourable to himself: namely, peace for France, with himself remaining in power as its head. If peace were rejected by the Coalition powers, despite any pre-emptive military success he might have achieved using the offensive military option available to him, then the war would continue and he could turn his attention to defeating the rest of the Coalition armies.

Napoleon&#x27;s decision to attack in Belgium was supported by several considerations. First, he had learned that the British and Prussian armies were widely dispersed and might be defeated in detail. Further, the British troops in Belgium were largely second-line troops; most of the veterans of the Peninsular War had been sent to America to fight the War of 1812. And, politically, a French victory might trigger a friendly revolution in French-speaking Brussels.

==Waterloo campaign==


The Waterloo Campaign (15 June – 8 July 1815) was fought between the French Army of the North and two Seventh Coalition armies: an Anglo-allied army and a Prussian army. Initially the French army was commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, but he left for Paris after the French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Command then rested on Marshals Soult and Grouchy, who were in turn replaced by Marshal Davout, who took command at the request of the French Provisional Government. The Anglo-allied army was commanded by the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian army by Prince Blücher.

===Start of hostilities (15 June)===

Hostilities started on 15 June when the French drove in the Prussian outposts and crossed the Sambre at Charleroi and secured Napoleon&#x27;s favoured &quot;central position&quot;—at the junction between the cantonment areas of Wellington&#x27;s army (to the west) and Blücher&#x27;s army to the east.

===Battles of Quatre Bras and Ligny (16 June)===
On 16 June, the French prevailed, with Marshal Ney commanding the left wing of the French army holding Wellington at the Battle of Quatre Bras and Napoleon defeating Blücher at the Battle of Ligny.

===Interlude (17 June)===
On 17 June, Napoleon left Grouchy with the right wing of the French army to pursue the Prussians, while he took the reserves and command of the left wing of the army to pursue Wellington towards Brussels. On the night of 17 June, the Anglo-allied army turned and prepared for battle on a gentle escarpment, about south of the village of Waterloo.

===Battle of Waterloo (18 June)===
The next day, the Battle of Waterloo proved to be the decisive battle of the campaign. The Anglo-allied army stood fast against repeated French attacks, until with the aid of several Prussian corps that arrived on the east of the battlefield in the early evening, they managed to rout the French Army. Grouchy, with the right wing of the army, engaged a Prussian rearguard at the simultaneous Battle of Wavre, and although he won a tactical victory, his failure to prevent the Prussians marching to Waterloo meant that his actions contributed to the French defeat at Waterloo. The next day (19 June), Grouchy left Wavre and started a long retreat back to Paris.

===Invasion of France===

After the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon chose not to remain with the army and attempt to rally it, but return to Paris to try to secure political support for further action. This he failed to do. The two Coalition armies hotly pursued the French army to the gates of Paris, during which time the French, on occasion, turned and fought some delaying actions, in which thousands of men were killed.

===Abdication of Napoleon (22 June)===

On arriving at Paris, three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of concerted national resistance, but the temper of the chambers and of the public generally forbade any such attempt. Napoleon and his brother Lucien Bonaparte were almost alone in believing that, by dissolving the chambers and declaring Napoleon dictator, they could save France from the armies of the powers now converging on Paris. Even Davout, minister of war, advised Napoleon that the destiny of France rested solely with the chambers. Clearly, it was time to safeguard what remained, and that could best be done under Talleyrand&#x27;s shield of legitimacy. Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès was the minister of justice during this time and was a close confidant of Napoleon.

Napoleon himself at last recognised the truth. When Lucien pressed him to &quot;dare&quot;, he replied, &quot;Alas, I have dared only too much already&quot;. On 22 June 1815 he abdicated in favour of his son, Napoleon II, well knowing that it was a formality, as his four-year-old son was in Austria.

===French Provisional Government===

With the abdication of Napoleon, a provisional government with Joseph Fouché as President of the Executive Commission was formed, under the nominal authority of Napoleon II.

Initially, the remnants of the French Army of the North (the left wing and the reserves) that was routed at Waterloo were commanded by Marshal Soult, while Grouchy kept command of the right wing that had fought at Wavre. However, on 25 June, Soult was relieved of his command by the Provisional Government and was replaced by Grouchy, who in turn was placed under the command of Marshal Davout.

On the same day, 25 June, Napoleon received from Fouché, the president of the newly appointed provisional government (and Napoleon&#x27;s former police chief), an intimation that he must leave Paris. He retired to Malmaison, the former home of Joséphine, where she had died shortly after his first abdication.

On 29 June, the near approach of the Prussians, who had orders to seize Napoleon, dead or alive, caused him to retire westwards toward Rochefort, whence he hoped to reach the United States. The presence of blockading Royal Navy warships under Vice Admiral Henry Hotham, with orders to prevent his escape, forestalled this plan.

===Coalition forces enter Paris (7 July)===
French troops concentrated in Paris had as many soldiers as the invaders and more cannons. There were two major skirmishes and a few minor ones near Paris during the first few days of July. In the first major skirmish, the Battle of Rocquencourt, on 1 July, French dragoons, supported by infantry and commanded by General Exelmans, destroyed a Prussian brigade of hussars under the command of Colonel von Sohr (who was severely wounded and taken prisoner during the skirmish), before retreating. In the second skirmish, on 3 July, General Dominique Vandamme (under Davout&#x27;s command) was decisively defeated by General von Zieten (under Blücher&#x27;s command) at the Battle of Issy, forcing the French to retreat into Paris.

With this defeat, all hope of holding Paris faded and the French Provisional Government authorised delegates to accept capitulation terms, which led to the Convention of St. Cloud (the surrender of Paris) and the end of hostilities between France and the armies of Blücher and Wellington.

On 4 July, under the terms of the Convention of St. Cloud, the French army, commanded by Marshal Davout, left Paris and proceeded to cross the river Loire. The Anglo-allied troops occupied Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen, Clichy and Neuilly. On 5 July, the Anglo-allied army took possession of Montmartre. On 6 July, the Anglo-allied troops occupied the Barriers of Paris, on the right of the Seine, while the Prussians occupied those upon the left bank.

On 7 July, the two Coalition armies, with von Zieten&#x27;s Prussian I Corps as the vanguard, entered Paris. The Chamber of Peers, having received from the Provisional Government a notification of the course of events, terminated its sittings; the Chamber of Representatives protested, but in vain. Their President (Lanjuinais) resigned his chair, and on the following day, the doors were closed and the approaches guarded by Coalition troops.

==Restoration of Louis XVIII (8 July)==
On 8 July, the French King, Louis XVIII, made his public entry into Paris, amidst the acclamations of the people, and again occupied the throne.

During Louis XVIII&#x27;s entry into Paris, Count Chabrol, prefect of the department of the Seine, accompanied by the municipal body, addressed the King, in the name of his companions, in a speech that began &quot;Sire,—One hundred days have passed away since your majesty, forced to tear yourself from your dearest affections, left your capital amidst tears and public consternation. ...&quot;.

==Surrender of Napoleon (15 July)==

Unable to remain in France or escape from it, Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of in the early morning of 15 July 1815 and was transported to England. Napoleon was taken to the island of Saint Helena where he died as a prisoner in May 1821.

==Other campaigns and wars==
While Napoleon had assessed that the Coalition forces in and around Brussels on the borders of north-east France posed the greatest threat, because Tolly&#x27;s Russian army of 150,000 were still not in the theatre, Spain was slow to mobilise, Prince Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Austrian army of 210,000 were slow to cross the Rhine, and another Austrian force menacing the south-eastern frontier of France was still not a direct threat, Napoleon still had to place some badly needed forces in positions where they could defend France against other Coalition forces whatever the outcome of the Waterloo campaign.

===Neapolitan War===

The Neapolitan War between the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire started on 15 March 1815 when Marshal Joachim Murat declared war on Austria, and ended on 20 May 1815 with the signing of the Treaty of Casalanza.

Napoleon had made his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, King of Naples on 1 August 1808. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1813, Murat reached an agreement with Austria to save his own throne. However, he realized that the European Powers, meeting as the Congress of Vienna, planned to remove him and return Naples to its Bourbon rulers. So, after issuing the so-called Rimini Proclamation urging Italian patriots to fight for independence, Murat moved north to fight against the Austrians, who were the greatest threat to his rule.

The war was triggered by a pro-Napoleon uprising in Naples, after which Murat declared war on Austria on 15 March 1815, five days before Napoleon&#x27;s return to Paris. The Austrians were prepared for war. Their suspicions were aroused weeks earlier, when Murat applied for permission to march through Austrian territory to attack the south of France. Austria had reinforced her armies in Lombardy under the command of Bellegarde prior to war being declared.

The war ended after a decisive Austrian victory at the Battle of Tolentino. Ferdinand IV was reinstated as King of Naples. Ferdinand then sent Neapolitan troops under General Onasco to help the Austrian army in Italy attack southern France. In the long term, the intervention by Austria caused resentment in Italy, which further spurred on the drive towards Italian unification.

===Civil war===
Provence and Brittany, which were known to contain many royalist sympathisers, did not rise in open revolt, but La Vendée did. The Vendée Royalists successfully took Bressuire and Cholet, before they were defeated by General Lamarque at the Battle of Rocheserviere on 20 June. They signed the Treaty of Cholet six days later on 26 June.

===Austrian campaign===

====Rhine frontier====
In early June, General Rapp&#x27;s Army of the Rhine of about 23,000 men, with a leavening of experienced troops, advanced towards Germersheim to block Schwarzenberg&#x27;s expected advance, but on hearing the news of the French defeat at Waterloo, Rapp withdrew towards Strasbourg turning on 28 June to check the 40,000 men of General Württemberg&#x27;s Austrian III Corps at the Battle of La Suffel—the last pitched battle of the Napoleonic Wars and a French victory. The next day Rapp continued to retreat to Strasbourg and also sent a garrison to defend Colmar. He and his men took no further active part in the campaign and eventually submitted to the Bourbons.

To the north of Württenberg&#x27;s III Corps, General Wrede&#x27;s Austrian (Bavarian) IV Corps also crossed the French frontier, and then swung south and captured Nancy, against some local popular resistance on 27 June. Attached to his command was a Russian detachment, under the command of General Count Lambert, that was charged with keeping Wrede&#x27;s lines of communication open. In early July, Schwarzenberg, having received a request from Wellington and Blücher, ordered Wrede to act as the Austrian vanguard and advance on Paris, and by 5 July, the main body of Wrede&#x27;s IV Corps had reached Châlons. On 6 July, the advance guard made contact with the Prussians, and on 7 July Wrede received intelligence of the Paris Convention and a request to move to the Loire. By 10 July, Wrede&#x27;s headquarters were at Ferté-sous-Jouarre and his corps positioned between the Seine and the Marne.

Further south, General Colloredo&#x27;s Austrian I Corps was hindered by General Lecourbe&#x27;s &quot;Armée du Jura&quot;, which was largely made up of National Guardsmen and other reserves. Lecourbe fought four delaying actions between 30 June and 8 July at Foussemagne, Bourogne, Chèvremont and Bavilliers before agreeing to an armistice on 11 July. Archduke Ferdinand&#x27;s Reserve Corps, together with Hohenzollern-Hechingen&#x27;s II Corps, laid siege to the fortresses of Hüningen and Mühlhausen, with two Swiss brigades from the Swiss Army of General Niklaus Franz von Bachmann, aiding with the siege of Huningen. Like other Austrian forces, these too were pestered by &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;.

====Italian frontier====
Like Rapp further north, Marshal Suchet, with the &quot;Armée des Alpes&quot;, took the initiative and on 14 June invaded Savoy. Facing him was General Frimont, with an Austro-Sardinian army of 75,000 men based in Italy. However, on hearing of the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Suchet negotiated an armistice and fell back to Lyons, where on 12 July he surrendered the city to Frimont&#x27;s army.

The coast of Provence was defended by French forces under Marshal Brune, who fell back slowly into the fortress city of Toulon, after retreating from Marseilles before the Austrian Army of Naples under the command of General Bianchi, the Anglo-Sicilian forces of Sir Hudson Lowe, supported by the British Mediterranean fleet of Lord Exmouth, and the Sardinian forces of the Sardinian General d&#x27;Osasco, the forces of the latter being drawn from the garrison of Nice. Brune did not surrender the city and its naval arsenal until 31 July.

===Russian campaign===
The main body of the Russian Army, commanded by Field Marshal Count Tolly and amounting to 167,950 men, crossed the Rhine at Mannheim on 25 June—after Napoleon had abdicated for the second time—and although there was light resistance around Mannheim, it was over by the time the vanguard had advanced as far as Landau. The greater portion of Tolly&#x27;s army reached Paris and its vicinity by the middle of July.

==Treaty of Paris==

Issy was the last field engagement of the Hundred Days. There was a campaign against fortresses still commanded by Bonapartist governors that ended with the capitulation of Longwy on 13 September 1815. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815, bringing the Napoleonic Wars to a formal end.

Under the 1815 Paris treaty, the previous year&#x27;s Treaty of Paris and the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, of 9 June 1815, were confirmed. France was reduced to its 1790 boundaries; it lost the territorial gains of the Revolutionary armies in 1790–1792, which the previous Paris treaty had allowed France to keep. France was now also ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, in five yearly installments, and to maintain at its own expense a Coalition army of occupation of 150,000 soldiers in the eastern border territories of France, from the English Channel to the border with Switzerland, for a maximum of five years. The two-fold purpose of the military occupation was made clear by the convention annexed to the treaty, outlining the incremental terms by which France would issue negotiable bonds covering the indemnity: in addition to safeguarding the neighbouring states from a revival of revolution in France, it guaranteed fulfilment of the treaty&#x27;s financial clauses.

On the same day, in a separate document, Great Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia renewed the Quadruple Alliance. The princes and free towns who were not signatories were invited to accede to its terms, whereby the treaty became a part of the public law according to which Europe, with the exception of the Ottoman Empire, established &quot;relations from which a system of real and permanent balance of power in Europe is to be derived&quot;.

<text>Cimolomyidae is a family of fossil mammala within the extinct order Multituberculata. Representatives are known from the Late Cretaceous of North America and Mongolia, from the late Santonian to their extinction at the end of the Maastrichtian. The family is part of the suborder Cimolodonta. Other than that, their systematic relationships are hard to define. Some authors have placed the taxon within Taeniolabidoidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001) expressly don&#x27;t.

The family Cimolomyidae was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889.

It contains the following genera:

* &quot;Cimolomys&quot;
* &quot;Buginbaatar&quot;
* &quot;Essonodon&quot;
* &quot;Meniscoessus&quot;
* ?&quot;Parikimys&quot;
* ?&quot;Paressonodon&quot;

<text>Hemimorphite is the chemical compound Zn4(Si2O7)(OH)2·H2O, a component of mineral calamine. It is a silicate mineral which, together with smithsonite (ZnCO3), has been historically mined from the upper parts of zinc and lead ores. Both compounds were originally believed to be the same mineral and classified as calamine. In the second half of the 18th century, it was discovered that these two different compounds were both present in calamine. They closely resemble one another.

The silicate was the rarer of the two and was named &quot;hemimorphite&quot; because of the hemimorph development of its crystals. This unusual form, which is typical of only a few minerals, means that the crystals are terminated by dissimilar faces. Hemimorphite most commonly forms crystalline crusts and layers, also massive, granular, rounded and reniform aggregates, concentrically striated, or finely needle-shaped, fibrous or stalactitic, and rarely fan-shaped clusters of crystals.

Some specimens show strong green fluorescence in shortwave ultraviolet light (253.7 nm) and weak light pink fluorescence in longwave UV.

==Occurrence==

Hemimorphite most frequently occurs as the product of the oxidation of the upper parts of sphalerite bearing ore bodies, accompanied by other secondary minerals which form the so-called &quot;iron cap&quot; or &quot;gossan&quot;. Hemimorphite is an important ore of zinc and contains up to 54.2% of the metal, together with silicon, oxygen and hydrogen. The crystals are blunt at one end and sharp at the other.
The regions on the Belgian-German border are well known for their deposits of hemimorphite of metasomatic origin, especially Vieille Montagne in Belgium and Aachen in Germany. Other deposits are in Tarnowskie Góry area in Upper Silesia, Poland; near Phoenixville, Pennsylvania; the Missouri lead-zinc district; Elkhorn, Montana; Leadville, Colorado; and Organ Mountains, New Mexico in the United States; and in several localities in North Africa. Further hemimorphite occurrences are the Padaeng deposit near Mae Sod in western Thailand; Sardinia; Nerchinsk, Siberia; Cave del Predil, Italy; Bleiberg, Carinthia, Austria; Matlock, Derbyshire, England.

<text>There is a long history of alcoholic drinks in China. They include rice and grape wine, beer, whisky and various liquors including &quot;baijiu&quot;, the most-consumed distilled spirit in the world.

==Name==
 (&quot;jiǔ&quot;) is the Chinese character referring to any drink containing appreciable quantities of ethanol. Its Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as &quot;*tsuʔ&quot;, at which point it was generally applied to drinks made from fermented millet. By the time of the first certain use of distillation during the Jin and Southern Song dynasties, the Middle Chinese pronunciation was &quot;tsjuw&quot;. It is often translated in English as &quot;wine&quot;, which misrepresents its current usage. In present-day Mandarin, &quot;jiǔ&quot; most commonly refers to pure alcohol, hard liquors, and strong rice wine, while wine and beer are distinguished as &quot;pútáojiǔ&quot; (,  &quot;grape &quot;jiu&quot;&quot;) and &quot;píjiǔ&quot; (, &quot;&#x27;beer&#x27; &quot;jiu&quot;&quot;), respectively.

Nonetheless, there are many &quot;cultural&quot; parallels with the use of wine in European culture. Chinese food employs &quot;jiǔ&quot; in its recipes and formal dining in an analogous manner; likewise, there are many parallels in upper-class etiquette and religious observance. It appears prominently in all of the Chinese classics, including the Rites of Zhou and the Record of Rites, and has been a constant theme of Chinese poetry since its origins, all similar to the treatment of wine in Europe.

==History==
===Ancient China===
Chinese alcohol predates recorded history. Dried residue extracted from 9,000-year-old pottery implies that early beers were already being consumed by the neolithic peoples in the area of modern China. Made from rice, honey, grapes, and hawthorn, it seems to have been produced similarly to that of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt.

Within the Yellow River area which gave rise to the Chinese culture, numerous bronze vessels preserved from the later Shang dynasty (whose oracle bones contained the first surviving Chinese characters) include many which were apparently used to warm alcohol. At the time, millet was the area&#x27;s staple grain and these drinks may have been similar to modern &quot;huangjiu&quot;. Traditional Chinese historical accounts such as Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; relate various legends and myths concerning the origin of alcohol in China. One account says that the brewer Yidi presented the first alcoholic beverage as a gift to the emperor Yu the Great  BC. Another credits its invention to Du Kang.

Chinese alcohol figured prominently in Zhou-era accounts of the removal of the Mandate of Heaven. The final ruler of the Xia dynasty, the emperor Jie, was said to have shown his decadence by constructing an entire lake of &quot;jiu&quot; to please one of his concubines. The pool was said to have been large enough to navigate with a boat. The story was repeated in accounts of Di Xin, the last emperor of the Shang. Alcoholism was said to have been so rampant among Shang culture that reducing it presented one of the principal difficulties for the new Zhou dynasty.

In the far northwest of modern China, the introduction of the irrigation and grape vines responsible for Xinjiang&#x27;s raisin and wine production are generally credited to settlers from 4th-century BC Bactria, one of the successor states to the empire of Alexander the Great. However, new research has refuted the notions of a foreign origin for Chinese grape wine and grape vines, because the history of Chinese grape wine has been confirmed and proven to date back 9000 years (7000 BC), including the &quot;(earliest attested use)&quot; of wild grapes in wine as well as &quot;earliest chemically confirmed alcoholic beverage in the world&quot;, according to Adjunct Professor of Anthropology Patrick McGovern, the Scientific Director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia.

Professor McGovern explains:

The earliest chemically confirmed alcoholic beverage in the world was discovered at Jiahu in the Yellow River Valley of China (Henan province), ca. 7000-6600 B.C. (Early Neolithic Period). It was an extreme fermented beverage made of wild grapes (the earliest attested use), hawthorn, rice, and honey. The Jiahu discovery illustrates how you should never give up hope in finding chemical evidence for a fermented beverage from the Palaeolithic period. Research very often has big surprises in store. You might think, as I did too, that the grape wines of Hajji Firuz, the Caucasus, and eastern Anatolia would prove to be the earliest alcoholic beverages in the world, coming from the so-called &quot;Cradle of Civilization&quot; in the Near East as they do. But then I was invited to go to China on the other side of Asia, and came back with samples that proved to be even earlier–from around 7000 BC.&quot;

===Imperial China===
Following the Yangtze&#x27;s incorporation into the Chinese state during the Qin dynasty, beer progressively disappeared from use over the course of the Han dynasty in favor of the stronger &quot;huangjiu&quot; and the rice wines of the southern Chinese. By the Tang dynasty, home brewing seems to have been a familiar domestic chore, albeit the poor had to make do with poorly filtered mash (, &quot;pēi&quot;). The sticky rice-based &quot;choujiu&quot; dates to at least the Tang and was specially praised by the Chinese poet Li Bai. The Dutch historian Frank Dikötter describes the period between the Han and Tang dynasties as a &quot;golden age&quot; for alcohol, when it was commonly consumed in conjunction with mineral drugs, notably Cold-Food Powder, until the &quot;rise of a tea culture during the Tang was a significant shift away from heavier patterns of intoxication&quot;.

As noted in Shen Kuo&#x27;s 11th-century &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, much of the socializing among the gentry concerned &quot;drinking guests&quot; (&quot;&quot;). A symposium beginning with drinking huangjiu might involve playing the zither and chess, Zen meditation, calligraphy and painting, drinking tea, alchemy, and reciting poetry, as well as general conversation.

Distillation may have been practiced in China as early as the later Han but the earliest evidence so far discovered has been dated to the Jin and Southern Song. A still dating to the 12th century was found during an archaeological dig at Qinglong in Hebei. Despite the popularity of Islam in the Mongol Empire and its growth within China during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the common consumption of distilled spirits such as &quot;baijiu&quot; dates to the same era.

===Modern China===
Wine was reintroduced to China at Macao by Portuguese traders and missionaries, who produced small batches for communion. This connection is retained in the Chinese transcription of the name Portugal, or , &#x27;grape teeth&#x27;. The production and its effect was minor, prior to the opening of the country by the 19th-century First and Second Opium Wars, after which European alcoholic beverages and methods of alcohol production were introduced throughout China. This European influence is particularly marked in the case of beer, whose modern Chinese name is a Qing-era transcription of the English &quot;beer&quot; and German . Two of the principal brewers in modern China, Tsingtao and Harbin, are named for the sites of the former major German and Russian breweries. Other establishments such as the EWO Brewery Ltd., (now owned by Suntory), grew up to serve demand for western beer in the Shanghai International Settlement.

Wine remained unfamiliar in China until Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s post-1978 reforms brought the country greater prosperity and greater integration into the world markets. From practically no consumption, it has already grown to either the fifth- or seventh-largest market for wine in the world with sales of 1.6 billion bottles during 2011, annualized growth rates of 20% between 2006 and 2011, and high future growth forecast. 28th Concours Mondial de Bruxelles, which is a global wine competition is scheduled to held during May 2021, at Yinchuan, China. China ranked 7th in the last competition in organic wine segment, which held in 2019.

==Types==

===Huangjiu===
Huangjiu or &quot;yellow wine&quot; is a fermented alcoholic beverage brewed directly from grains such as millet, rice, and wheat. It is not distilled but typically has an alcohol content around 15-20%. It is usually pasteurized, aged, and filtered prior to bottling. Despite its name, &quot;huangjiu&quot; may be clear, beige, or reddish as well as yellow. The Chinese &quot;mijiu&quot;, the predecessor of Japanese &quot;sake&quot;, is generally considered a form of &quot;huangjiu&quot; within China.
&quot;Huangjiu&quot; is further classified into various types, based on several factors. Among them are the drink&#x27;s &quot;dryness&quot;, the starter used in its production, and the production method.

===Baijiu===
Baijiu or &quot;shaojiu&quot; is a Chinese liquor. It is usually sorghum-based, but some varieties are distilled from &quot;huangjiu&quot; or other rice-based drinks. All typically have an alcohol content greater than 30% and are so similar in color and feel to vodka that &quot;baijiu&quot; is sometimes known as &quot;Chinese vodka&quot;. There are many varieties, classified by their fragrance, but most are only distilled once, permitting stronger flavors and scent than vodka. The prestige brand within China is the &quot;sauce-scented&quot; Moutai or Mao-t&#x27;ai, produced in the southern city of Maotai in Guizhou. More common brands include Luzhou Laojiao, Wuliangye and varieties of erguotou.

===Beer===

Modern Chinese beers retrieve from the Russian and German breweries established at Harbin and Qingdao. Most are pale lagers, although other styles are available, particularly in brewpubs catering to the expatriate communities in Beijing and Shanghai.

The principal Chinese brands are Tsingtao, Harbin, and Snow. Other major brewers include Yanjing, San Miguel, Zhujiang, and Reeb.

===Wine===

Domestic production within China is dominated by a few large vineyards, including Changyu Pioneer Wine, China Great Wall Wine, and Dynasty Wine Notable regions include Yantai, Beijing, Zhangjiakou in Hebei, Yibin in Sichuan, Tonghua in Jilin, Taiyuan in Shanxi, and Ningxia. Yantai alone holds over 140 wineries and produces 40% of the country&#x27;s wine.

Traditional Uyghur wine from Xinjiang is known as museles (Arabic: ,  &quot;the triangle&quot;). Its production requires crushing the grapes by hand, then straining them through atlas silk and boiling the juice with an equal volume of water, as well as added sugar. This is cooked until the original volume of the juice is reached and then stored in clay urns along with various flavorings.

A controversial drink that is still nowadays sold in the black market of the country is Tiger Bone Wine: this tonic is created crushing and mixing the bones with rice wine, in a long process that lasts for at least eight years. The drink has a high alcohol concentration, of about 58% and is used in both traditional Chinese Medicine and Martial Arts, and has been on the market for centuries.

===Other===
Other fermented beverages include &quot;choujiu&quot; (made from sticky rice), lychee wine, &quot;gouqi jiu&quot; (made from wolfberries), &quot;Qingke jiu&quot; (made from Tibetan highland barley), and kumis (made from mare or yak milk). The peach-scented Luzhou Laojiao prides itself on continuous production since 1573 during the Ming dynasty. The ginger-flavored liqueur Canton is no longer produced in China but is instead imported for consumption in the United States from a distillery in France unrelated to its original production.

Whisky demand is on the rise in China, but domestically produced whisky is limited.

==Culture==
Chinese alcoholic beverages have a long history both as a part of diet and ceremonies (both secular and religious), as well as being a part of the productive activities of many households and commercial establishments.

===Cuisine===
Chinese alcoholic beverages were traditionally warmed before being consumed, a practice going back to the early dynastic period. The temperature to which the liquor may be warmed ranges between approximately 35 and 55 °C, well below the boiling point of ethanol. Warming the liquor allows its aromas to be better appreciated by the drinker without losing too much alcohol. The optimal temperature for warming depends on the type of beverage as well as the preference of the drinker.

Traditionally, also, the drinks are consumed together with food rather than on their own. Neither practice is binding in modern China.

In addition to being used to brew liquor, the seed mash described above can also be made to be eaten or drunk as a sweet dessert.

===Medicine===
Traditional Chinese medicine frequently employed alcoholic drinks (associated with yin) and alcoholic drinks were likewise used as medicine. Alcohol including extracts of plants, herbs, animal parts, or minerals are not as common as they once were but may still be encountered. One example of such a medicinal alcoholic drink is realgar wine: consumed during the Dragon Boat Festival, realgar wine consisted of &quot;huangjiu&quot; mixed with realgar, an arsenic sulfide also used as an insecticide. It appears in the Chinese legend of the White Snake as the substance which forces the snake to reveal her true form. The drink was thought to prevent disease and misfortune (particularly snake bites and digestive worms) and to promote health; although modern Chinese authorities discourage the practice, it is still legally available for consumption.

<text>Entertainment law, also referred to as media law, is legal services provided to the entertainment industry. These services in entertainment law overlap with intellectual property law. Intellectual property has many moving parts that include trademarks, copyright, and the &quot;right of publicity&quot;. However, the practice of entertainment law often involves questions of employment law, contract law, torts, labor law, bankruptcy law, immigration, securities law, security interests, agency, right of privacy, defamation, advertising, criminal law, tax law, International law (especially private international law), and insurance law.

Much of the work of an entertainment law practice is transaction based, i.e., drafting contracts, negotiation and mediation. Some situations may lead to litigation or arbitration.

== Overview ==
Entertainment law covers an area of law that involves media of all different types (e.g. TV, film, music, publishing, advertising, Internet &amp; news media, etc.) and stretches over various legal fields, which include corporate, finance, intellectual property, publicity and privacy, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in the US.

For film, entertainment attorneys work with the actor&#x27;s agent to finalize the actor&#x27;s contracts for upcoming projects. After an agent lines up work for a star, the entertainment attorney negotiates with the agent and buyer of the actor&#x27;s talent for compensation and profit participation. Entertainment attorneys are under strict confidentiality agreements, so the specifics of their job are kept top secret. But, some entertainment attorney&#x27;s job descriptions have become comparable to those of a star&#x27;s agent, manager or publicist. Most entertainment attorneys have many other roles as well such as assisting in building a client&#x27;s career.

==History==
As the popularity of media became widespread, the field of media law became more popular and needed leaving certain corporate professionals wanting to participate more in media. As a result, many young lawyers fledged into media law for the opportunity to build more connections in media, become a media presenter, or even land an acting role. As technology continues to make huge advancements, many lawsuits have begun to arise, which makes the demand for lawyers extremely necessary.

==Categories==
Entertainment law is generally sub-divided into the following areas related to the types of activities that have their own specific trade unions, production techniques, rules, customs, case law, and negotiation strategies:

* F: option agreements, chain of title issues, talent agreements (screenwriters, film directors, actors, composers, production designers), production and post production and trade union issues, distribution issues, motion picture industry negotiations, distribution, and general intellectual property issues especially relating to copyright and, to a lesser extent, trademarks;
* I: Censorship, Copyright, Freedom of information, Information Technology, Privacy, and Telecommunications issues;
* M: software licensing issues, video game development and production, Information technology law, and general intellectual property issues;
* M: talent agreements (musicians, composers), producer agreements, and synchronization rights, music industry negotiation and general intellectual property issues, especially relating to copyright (see music law);
* P and P: advertising, models, author agreements and general intellectual property issues, especially relating to copyright;
* T and R: broadcast licensing and regulatory issues, mechanical licenses, and general intellectual property issues, especially relating to copyright;
* T: rental agreements and co-production agreements, and other performance oriented legal issues;
* V: fine arts, issues of consignment of artworks to art dealers, moral rights of sculptors regarding works in public places; and industrial design, issues related to the protection of graphic design elements in products.

Defamation (libel and slander), personality rights and privacy rights issues also arise in entertainment law.

Media law is a legal field that refers to the following:
* Advertising
* Broadcasting
* Censorship
* Confidentiality
* Contempt
* Copyright
* Corporate Law

* Defamation
* Entertainment
* Freedom of information
* Internet
* Information Technology
* Privacy
* Telecommunications
==Cases==

* Copyright: In Golan v. Holder, the Supreme Court ruled, in a 6–2 vote, the judges dismissed contentions in light of the First Amendment and the Constitution&#x27;s copyright provision, stating that the general population was not &quot;a class of sacred centrality&quot; and that copyright insurances may be extended regardless of whether they did not strive for new attempts to be made.
* Internet: In 2007, Viacom, a media aggregate that possesses MTV and Comedy Central TV, sued YouTube for $1 billion in light of copyright infringement claims for the unapproved posting of Viacom copyrighted material. In May 2008, YouTube began utilizing its advanced fingerprinting innovation to secure copyright-ensured content.
* Television: In an 8-0 choice, the Supreme Court held that in light of the fact that the FCC rules at the time did not cover &quot;short lived exclamations,&quot; the fines issued against Fox were unethical and subsequently discredited as &quot;illegally unclear&quot;.
* Music: Kesha v. Dr. Luke – In 2014, singer Kesha filed a civil suit against music producer Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, also referred to some as Dr. Luke for gender-based hate crimes and emotional distress. This civil suit caused Gottwald to in return sue Kesha for defamation and breach of contract. This case ended with a judge declining to release Kesha from her binding contract that prohibited her from continuing her career effectively. The judge took note that Kesha had entered an agreement after she had sworn under oath that no harassment was taking place. Many celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Demi Lovato have shown support for Kesha in an attempt to broadcast the injustice contract laws have played in the outcome of this case. Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift donated $250,000 to relieve Kesha of any financial obligations.

<text>Cimolomys (Greek for &quot;chalk mouse&quot;) is a mammal genus from the Upper Cretaceous of North America. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Cimolomyidae.

The genus &quot;Cimolomys&quot; was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889.

== Distribution ==
Remains of &quot;Cimolomys&quot; are widespread throughout the interior west of North America (the former landmass of Laramidia) throughout the Late Cretaceous, from the late Santonian to the end of the Maastrichtian. However, a few rare remains from concurrent formations in eastern North America (indeterminate remains from the Bladen Formation of North Carolina and Marshalltown Formation of New Jersey, the latter tentatively assigned to the western species &quot;C. clarki&quot;) suggest they were also found on the other side of the Western Interior Seaway, on the landmass of Appalachia.

==Species==
The species &quot;Cimolomys clarki&quot; was named by Sahni in 1972. Fossil remains were found in Campanian-Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) strata of Texas and Wyoming (United States). Possible remains have also come from New Jersey (USA). It probably weighed about 300 g, the same as a malnourished rat.

The species &quot;Cimolomys gracilis&quot; was named by Marsh O.C. in 1889, and has also been known as &quot;Cimolomys digona&quot; (Marsh 1889); &quot;Meniscoessus brevis&quot;; &quot;Ptilodus gracilus&quot; (Osborn H.F. 1893); and &quot;Selenacodon brevis&quot; (Marsh 1889). Remains were found in Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) strata of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming (USA) and Saskatchewan, Canada. This species likely weighed around 415 g, as much as a modern rat.

The species &quot;Cimolomys milliensis&quot; was named by Eaton J.G. in 1993.. Remains were found in Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) strata of Mill Creek, Utah (USA).

The species &quot;Cimolomys trochuus&quot; was named by Lillegraven J.A. in 1969. Remains were found in Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) strata of North America. The holotype is in the collection of the University of Alberta.

<text>Buginbaatar is an extinct genus of mammal from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. It is a member of the extinct order Multituberculata, within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Cimolomyidae. It lived towards the end of the Mesozoic era.

The genus &quot;Buginbaatar&quot; was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Sochava A.V. in 1969 based on the remains of a single species. Remains of this species, dubbed &quot;Buginbaatar clarki&quot;, were found in Upper Cretaceous strata of the Nemegt Formation of Bügiyn Tsav in Mongolia.
This is the only known Upper Cretaceous Mongolian multituberculate not to belong to the family Djadochtatherioidea. Remains are incomplete and the assignment of &quot;B.&quot; to the Cimolomyidae is tentative, (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum 2001, p. 408).

<text>() (derived from Japanese terms for vomiting, diarrhea and onomatopoeia for an expression of disgust) is a Japanese experimental music project, founded in 1985 by . 

Though they are often categorized with Japanese harsh noise acts such as Merzbow and Masonna, The Gerogerigegege has also released albums of more straightforward punk rock (&quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;), noise (&quot;45 RPM Performance&quot;), and ambient music (&quot;None Friendly&quot;, &quot;Endless Humiliation&quot;), in addition to several seven inch records mixing these styles with found recordings. The group is known for their 1990 album &quot;Tokyo Anal Dynamite&quot;, a 75-track live album drawing from noisecore, noise and hardcore punk.

Despite limited coverage during their initial run, due in part to the material&#x27;s extreme sound and vulgar subject matter, their music has since garnered a cult following. Juntaro Yamanouchi also ran the Vis a Vis record label.

== History ==
The Gerogerigegege was founded by Juntaro Yamanouchi in 1985, and their first performances took place in S&amp;M clubs. Their first performance outside of said clubs took place at the auditorium of Waseda University in October 1986.

Over the years, The Gerogerigegege has included many members, the most notable and consistent other than Yamanouchi being Gero 30 (aka Gero 56, real name Tetsuya Endoh), an exhibitionist known to masturbate onstage during live performances. Male masturbation is called in Japanese and was Gero 30&#x27;s trademark. Other members have included Toshinori Fukuda (aka Dynamite Gero) on drums, Hironao Komaki (Dee Dee Gero) on guitar, Junko Katoh (Gero Grace Seijoh), their live manager, and Masatoshi Katsuya (Gero Route 66), the band&#x27;s driver.

The Gerogerigegege is known for their releasing records with unusual concepts, such as 1989&#x27;s released after the death of Hirohito, which bookended a recording of people having sex to &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, the Japanese national anthem. A special edition of &quot;Showa&quot; falsely presented itself as a Ramones bootleg called &quot;Britzkrieg &#x27;75 (Demo Tracks)&quot;, with no mention of Gerogerigegege or &quot;Showa&quot; anywhere on the release. The &quot;Night&quot; 7″ features a recording of a man defecating into a toilet after the usual &quot;one, two, three, four&quot; count. The compilation album &quot;Recollections of Primary Masturbation&quot; contains 338 songs, including the entirety of &quot;Tokyo Anal Dynamite&quot; as one track.

There are also some non-musical conceptual releases including &quot;Shaking Box Music: You Are the Noise Maker&quot;, which consists of 100 blank cassettes in a large metal box. &quot;This Is Shaking Box Music Part 2&quot;, which is a destroyed copy of the &quot;Mother Fellatio&quot; EP in a cassette case. &quot;Art Is Over&quot; consists of a single octopus tentacle housed in a cassette box. These non-music releases were typically released in even smaller quantities than the music releases, in quantities of 50 or less. Similar concepts are rampant throughout the band&#x27;s catalog, and often, the more ridiculous the theme or packaging of a release is, the more sought after it is by collectors. Copies of some Gerogerigegege records sell for hundreds of US dollars.

Following the release of &quot;Saturday Night Big Cock Salaryman&quot; in 2001, The Gerogerigegege became inactive. Yamanouchi had seemingly disappeared and people who had dealings with The Gerogerigegege had no idea on how to contact him. Rumors proliferated regarding his fate, often driven by speculation based on the group&#x27;s musical output. On 27 August 2013, a Twitter post from Gidayū Kaitai () stated that he had been contacted by Yamanouchi.

The first release from Gerogerigegege in 15 years, , was released on 20 April 2016 by Eskimo Records in Japan. This was followed up in 2019 with &quot;Uguisudani Apocalypse&quot;.

<doc id="216017" wikidata="Q6582527" url="?curid=216017" title="Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)">
<text>is a 1998 action-adventure stealth video game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation. It was directed, produced, and written by Hideo Kojima, and follows the MSX2 video games &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, on which Kojima also worked. It was unveiled at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show and then demonstrated at trade shows including the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo; its Japanese release was originally planned for late 1997, before being delayed to 1998.

Players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate hostages and stop the terrorists from launching a nuclear strike. Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting is used throughout.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; received critical acclaim. It sold more than copies worldwide and shipped 12million demos. It scored an average of 94/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important video games of all time and helped popularize the stealth genre and in-engine cinematic cutscenes. It was followed by an expanded version for PlayStation and Windows, Metal Gear Solid: Integral (1999)&quot;,&quot; and a GameCube remake, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot; (2004). The original game was re-released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable as a downloadable PSone Classics title on the PlayStation Network on March 21, 2008, in Japan, June 18, 2009, in North America, and November 19, 2009, in Europe; this version was later bundled alongside its sequels in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection&quot; compilation in 2013 for PS3. The game was later ported by M2 and included as part of the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection&quot; &quot;Vol. 1&quot; compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S in 2023. It produced numerous sequels, starting with &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; in 2001, and media adaptations including a radio drama, comics, and novels.

==Gameplay==
The player must navigate the protagonist, Solid Snake, through a nuclear weapons facility without being detected by enemies. When Snake moves into an enemy&#x27;s field of vision, he sets off an &quot;alert mode&quot; that draws enemies. The player must then hide until &quot;evasion mode&quot; begins; when the counter reaches zero, the game returns to &quot;infiltration mode&quot;, where enemies are no longer suspicious. The radar cannot be used in alert or evasion mode. In addition to the stealth gameplay, set-piece sequences entail firefights between the player and enemies.

To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques that make use of Snake&#x27;s abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with the location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in severe damage to Snake.

Despite the switch to 3D, the game is still played primarily from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or when equipping certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake&#x27;s surroundings and see what&#x27;s ahead of him.

Progress is punctuated by cutscenes and radio conversations, as well as encounters with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec, a radio communication device where advice is delivered from Snake&#x27;s support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec is also used to provide exposition on the game&#x27;s backstory.

In addition to the main story, there is also a VR training mode in which the player can test out their sneaking skills in a series of artificially constructed environments. This mode is divided into three main categories (practice, time attack, and gun shooting), each consisting of ten stages. After completing all 30 stages, a survival mission is unlocked in which the player must sneak their way through ten consecutive stages under a seven-minute limit.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; takes place in an alternate history in which the Cold War continued into the 1990s, ending at some point near the end of the 20th century. The game&#x27;s events take place six years after those in downfall of Zanzibarland, and form the third chapter in an overarching plot concerning the character of Solid Snake.

===Characters===

The protagonist is Solid Snake, a legendary infiltrator and saboteur. During the mission, Snake receives support and advice via codec radio. Colonel Roy Campbell, Solid Snake&#x27;s former commanding officer, supports Snake with information and tactics. While he initially keeps some secrets from Snake, he gradually reveals them. He is joined by Naomi Hunter, who gives medical advice; Nastasha Romanenko, who provides item and weapon tips; Master Miller, a former drill instructor and survival coach; and Mei Ling, who invented the Soliton radar system used in the mission and is also in charge of mission data; the player can call her to save the game.

The main antagonist of the game is Liquid Snake, leader of a now-terrorist splinter cell of the organization FOXHOUND, and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake. An elite special forces unit, FOXHOUND contains experts specializing in different tasks. Members are Revolver Ocelot, a Western-style gunslinger and expert interrogator whose weapon of choice is the Colt Single Action Army; Sniper Wolf, a preternatural sniper; Vulcan Raven, a hulking Alaskan shaman armed with an M61 Vulcan torn from a downed F-16; Psycho Mantis, a psychic profiler and psychokinesis expert; and Decoy Octopus, a master of disguise.

Other characters include Meryl Silverburgh, Colonel Campbell&#x27;s niece and a rookie soldier stationed in Shadow Moses who did not join the revolt; Dr. Hal Emmerich, the lead developer of Metal Gear REX; and Gray Fox, also known as the &quot;Ninja&quot;, a mysterious cybernetically enhanced agent who is neither an ally nor an enemy of Snake but does oppose FOXHOUND.

===Plot===
In 2005, renegade genetically enhanced special forces unit FOXHOUND seized control of a remote island in Alaska&#x27;s Fox Archipelago codenamed &quot;Shadow Moses&quot;, which houses a nuclear weapons disposal facility. FOXHOUND threatens to use the nuclear-capable mecha Metal Gear REX, being secretly tested at the facility, against the US government, if they do not receive the remains of Big Boss and a ransom of $1 billion within 24 hours. Solid Snake is forced out of retirement by Colonel Roy Campbell to infiltrate the island and neutralize the threat.

Snake enters the facility via an air vent and locates the first hostage, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson. Anderson reveals that Metal Gear REX can be deactivated with a secret detonation override code, but dies of a heart attack. Colonel Campbell&#x27;s niece Meryl Silverburgh, held hostage in a neighboring cell, helps Snake escape. Snake locates another hostage, ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot. Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot&#x27;s right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave a PAL card that might prevent the launch, but he too dies of a sudden heart attack.

Over Codec, Meryl agrees to meet in the warhead disposal area on the condition that Snake contacts Metal Gear&#x27;s designer, Dr. Hal &quot;Otacon&quot; Emmerich. En route, Snake receives an anonymous codec call calling themselves &quot;Deepthroat&quot;, warning him of a tank ambush. Snake fends off the attack from Vulcan Raven and proceeds to the rendezvous, where he locates Otacon. The ninja reappears, and Snake realizes it is his former ally Gray Fox, believed dead. Devastated over learning REX&#x27;s true intentions, Otacon agrees to aid Snake remotely using special camouflage to procure information and supplies.

Snake meets Meryl and receives the PAL card. As they head for the underground base, Meryl is possessed by psychic Psycho Mantis and pulls her gun on Snake. He disarms her and defeats Mantis, who informs Snake that he has &quot;a large place&quot; in her heart. After they reach the underground passageway, Sniper Wolf ambushes them, wounds Meryl, and captures Snake. Liquid confirms Snake&#x27;s suspicion that they are twin brothers. After being tortured by Ocelot, Snake is confused to discover Anderson&#x27;s body in his cell, seemingly dead for days. He escapes with the help of Otacon, makes his way up the communications tower, and fends off a Hind D helicopter attack from Liquid. As he emerges onto a snowfield, he is confronted again by Sniper Wolf. He kills her, devastating Otacon, who was infatuated with her.

Snake continues to REX&#x27;s hangar and is ambushed again by Raven. After Snake defeats him, Raven tells Snake that the &quot;Anderson&quot; he conversed with was, in fact, FOXHOUND disguise artist Decoy Octopus. Infiltrating Metal Gear&#x27;s hangar, Snake overhears Liquid and Ocelot preparing the REX launch sequence and uses the PAL card, but this unexpectedly activates REX. Liquid reveals that he has been impersonating Snake&#x27;s advisor Master Miller and that FOXHOUND has used Snake to facilitate REX&#x27;s launch. He and Snake are the product of the &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot; project, a 1970s government program to clone Big Boss. He also reveals to Snake the government&#x27;s true reason for sending him: Snake is unknowingly carrying a weaponized &quot;FOXDIE&quot; virus that causes cardiac arrest in FOXHOUND members on contact, allowing the government to retrieve REX undamaged.

As Liquid, in REX, battles Snake, Gray Fox appears. He reveals to Snake that he was Deepthroat, destroys REX&#x27;s radome, and is crushed to death by REX. Snake destroys REX and defeats Liquid, then escapes with Meryl or Otacon via a tunnel, pursued by Liquid in a jeep. After their vehicles crash, Liquid pulls a gun on Snake but dies from FOXDIE. Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command, calls off a nuclear strike to destroy evidence of the operation and has Snake registered as killed in action to stop the US government searching for him. Naomi Hunter, who injected Snake with the FOXDIE virus, tells him that he has an indeterminate amount of time before it kills him. Ocelot calls the US President; he was a double agent whose mission was to steal Baker&#x27;s disk of Metal Gear specifications, and identifies the President as being the secret third clone of Big Boss.

==Development==
Director Hideo Kojima originally planned his third &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game in 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Kojima was initially planning &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; while &quot;Policenauts&quot; (1994) was still in development. Conceptual artwork by Yoji Shinkawa of the characters Solid Snake, Meryl Silverburgh, who was also a character in the adventure game &quot;Policenauts&quot;, and the FOXHOUND team, were included in the &quot;Policenauts: Pilot Disk&quot; preceding the release of the full version of the 3DO game in 1995.

The game was titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, rather than &quot;Metal Gear 3&quot;, as Kojima felt that the previous MSX2 games that he worked on were not widely known, due to the fact that they were not released in North America and only the first one was released in Europe (an NES version of the first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; was released in North America, but Kojima had no involvement with it or its sequel &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;). The word &quot;Solid,&quot; derived from the codename of series&#x27;s protagonist Solid Snake (as well as the title of the second MSX2 game), was chosen not only to represent the fact that it was the third entry of the series, but also the transition from 2D to 3D computer graphics.

Considering first person games difficult to control, the team opted to give the gameplay a 2D style by having it predominantly played from an overhead angle, while using 3D graphics and the ability to switch to first person on the fly to make it feel as though the game were taking place in a real 3D world.

Development for &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; began in 1995, but was briefly halted due to the Great Hanshin earthquake which caused major damage to the development studio. When development of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; resumed, it was moved over to the PlayStation platform. Developers aimed for accuracy and realism while making the game enjoyable and tense. In the early stages of development, the Huntington Beach SWAT team educated the creators with a demonstration of vehicles, weapons, and explosives. Weapons expert Motosada Mori was also tapped as a technical adviser in the research, which included visits to Fort Irwin and firing sessions at Stembridge Gun Rentals. Kojima stated that &quot;if the player isn&#x27;t tricked into believing that the world is real, then there&#x27;s no point in making the game.&quot; To fulfill this, adjustments were made to every detail, such as individually designed desks.

The characters and mecha designs were made by artist Yoji Shinkawa based on Kojima&#x27;s concepts. When designing props and hardware, he first built plastic models at home, and then drew the final designs from the models. According to Shinkawa, Solid Snake&#x27;s physique in this particular installment was based on Jean-Claude Van Damme, while his facial appearance was based on Christopher Walken. Konami had decided that the middle-aged appearance of Snake in the previous games did not have good commercial appeal, and opted to redesign him so that he would look younger. The characters were completed by polygonal artists using brush drawings and clay models by Shinkawa. According to Kojima, &quot;the ninja&#x27;s cloaking effect is the result of a bug. Of course, it wasn&#x27;t totally coincidence since we wanted that effect anyway, but we did get a somewhat unexpected result.&quot; Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the environment, such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a storage compartment. Additionally, he wanted &quot;a full orchestra right next to the player&quot;; a system which made modifications such as tempo and texture to the currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track. Although these features could not be achieved, they were implemented in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;.

Kojima used Lego building blocks and toy figurines to model 3D areas and see what the planned camera views would look like. The game was developed by a staff of twenty people, a small team for such a major title. Kojima preferred to have a smaller team so that he got to know everyone in the team and what they were working on, and could know if anyone was sick or unhappy. The team size did not expand to full strength until September 1996; initially, there was only a single programmer working on the game&#x27;s code.

Because the developers wanted the game&#x27;s action to be stylized and movie-like rather than realistic, they opted not to use motion capture, instead having an artist with experience in anime design the animations by hand.

A gameplay demo of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was first revealed to the public at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show and was later shown at E3 1997 as a short video. The 1997 version had several differences, including a more controllable camera and blue-colored vision cones. The demo generated significant buzz and positive reviews at the event, for its game design emphasizing stealth and strategy (like earlier &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games), its presentation, and the unprecedented level of real-time 3D graphical detail for the PlayStation. The enthusiastic response to the game at E3 took Kojima by surprise, and increased his expectations for the game&#x27;s performance in the American market. The game&#x27;s Japanese release was originally planned for late 1997, but was delayed to 1998.

It was playable for the first time at the Tokyo Game Show in 1998 and released the same year in Japan with an extensive promotional campaign. Television and magazine advertisements, in-store samples, and demo giveaways contributed to a total of $8 million in promotional costs.

===Voice acting===
Except for David Hayter (Solid Snake), the English voice cast was credited with pseudonyms. Reportedly, this was done because the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s rules at the time were unclear regarding performances for video games. When the actors returned for the 2004 remake &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, they were credited with their real names.

===Music===


The musical score of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was composed by Konami&#x27;s in-house musicians, including Kazuki Muraoka, Hiroyuki Togo, Takanari Ishiyama, Lee Jeon Myung, and Maki Kirioka. Composer and lyricist Rika Muranaka provided a song called &quot;The Best is Yet To Come&quot; for the game&#x27;s ending credits sequence. The song is performed in Irish by Aoife Ní Fhearraigh. The main theme was composed by Tappi Iwase from the Konami Kukeiha Club.

Music played in-game has a synthetic feel with increased pace and introduction of strings during tense moments, with a looping style endemic to video games. Overtly cinematic music, with stronger orchestral and choral elements, appears in cutscenes. The soundtrack was released on September 23, 1998, under the King Records label.

==Release==
&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was first released for the PlayStation in Japan on September 3, 1998. The game was available in a standard edition, as well as a limited &quot;Premium Package&quot; edition sold in a large box that also contained a t-shirt, a pair of FOXHOUND-themed dog tags, memory card stickers, an audio CD featuring the soundtracks from the MSX2 &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games (including a few bonus arranged tracks), and a 40-page booklet, &quot;Metal Gear Solid Classified,&quot; featuring production notes, interviews with the developers, and a glossary of terminology in the game.

The North American version was released a month later on October 20. Changes and additions were made to this version, such as a choice of three difficulty settings when starting a new game (with a fourth setting that is unlocked after completing the game once), an alternate tuxedo outfit for Snake (which the character wears on every third playthrough on the same save file), and a &quot;demo theater&quot; mode where the player views every cutscene and radio conversations relevant to the main story. Jeremy Blaustein, who previously worked on the English localization of &quot;Snatcher&quot; for the Sega CD, wrote the English version of the script. One change in the English script was the addition of Western sources and authors to Mei-Ling&#x27;s pool of motivational quotes; originally the character only cited Chinese proverbs natively, providing an explanation afterward in Japanese, but this proved challenging to adapt during the translation. The games detected by Psycho Mantis when he reads the player&#x27;s memory card were also changed, due to certain games (such as the &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; series) not being released outside Japan. This resulted in Kojima&#x27;s cameo (in which he thanks the player for supporting his work via a voiceover) being cut from the Western versions, as save data from two PlayStation games not available outside Japan, &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Policenauts&quot;, needed to be present on the player&#x27;s memory card for this Easter egg to appear.

The game was launched in Europe on February 22, 1999, with versions voiced in French, Italian, and German available in addition to English. A Spanish dubbed version was later released on May 1. Like in Japan, a limited edition of the game was released, although the contents of the European limited edition differs from the Japanese counterpart. The European Premium Package comes with the game software itself and its soundtrack album CD, along with a t-shirt, dog tags, memory card stickers, a double sided movie-style poster and a set of postcards.

The Japanese PlayStation version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was reissued twice: once under &quot;The Best&quot; series and later under &quot;PS one Books.&quot; Likewise, the American and European versions of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; were reissued under the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Platinum&quot; series respectively. The game is included in the Japanese &quot;Metal Gear Solid: 20th Anniversary Collection&quot; set and in the American &quot;Essential Collection&quot; set. The original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was released on the PlayStation Store for download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable on March 21, 2008, in Japan and on June 18, 2009, in North America and on November 19 of the same year in Europe.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; is one of the twenty PlayStation games included in the PlayStation Classic released in 2018. The game is included in both the Japanese and western models of the unit in their respective versions.

===&quot;Integral&quot;===
Released on June 25, 1999, for the PlayStation in Japan, is an expanded edition of the game that features the added content from the American and European versions. It replaces the Japanese voices from the original version with the English dub, offering players a choice between Japanese and English subtitles during cutscenes and CODEC conversations (item descriptions, mission logs, and other text are still in Japanese). Further additional content to the main game include an alternate &quot;sneaking suit&quot; outfit for Meryl (which she wears when Snake is dressed in the tuxedo), a &quot;Very Easy&quot; difficulty setting where the player starts the mission armed with a suppressor-equipped MP5 submachine gun with infinite ammo (substituting the FAMAS rifle in Snake&#x27;s inventory), an eighth Codec frequency featuring commentary from the development team (unvoiced and in Japanese text only) on every area and boss encounter, hidden music tracks, an alternate game mode where the player controls Snake from a first-person perspective (on Normal difficulty only), an option for alternative patrol routes for enemies, and a downloadable PocketStation minigame. The Torture Event was also made easier, reducing the number of rounds to three per session on all five difficulty settings.

The VR training mode is now stored on a separate third disc, known as the &quot;VR Disc&quot;, and has been expanded into 300 missions. These new set of missions are divided into four main categories: Sneaking, Weapons, Advanced, and Special. The first three categories feature standard training exercises that test the player&#x27;s sneaking, shooting, and combat skills, while the fourth category contains less conventional tests involving murder mysteries, giant genome soldiers, and flying saucers. One particular set of missions has the player controlling the Cyborg Ninja, unlocked by either completing a minigame on the PocketStation and uploading the data to the VR Disc or by achieving the Fox rank on the main game. Completing all 300 missions will unlock a concept artwork of Metal Gear RAY, a mech that would later appear in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. Additional content includes preview trailers of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; from trade events and a photoshoot mode where the player can take photographs of fully expressive polygonal models of Mei Ling and Dr. Naomi after completing the main game. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine rated &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Integral&quot; a 34 out of 40.

The VR Disc from &quot;Integral&quot; was released by itself during the same year in other regions as &quot;Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions&quot; in North America on September 23 and as &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions&quot; in the PAL region on October 29. While the content of both, &quot;VR Missions&quot; and &quot;Special Missions&quot;, are virtually identical to the VR Disc, the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly, so that save data from the main game was no longer required. The &quot;Special Missions&quot; version also adds an additional requirement in which the user must also own a copy of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in PAL format in order to start the game - after booting &quot;Special Missions&quot; on the console, the player will be asked to switch the disc with the first disc from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; to load data before asking the player to switch back to the &quot;Special Missions&quot; disc to proceed through the rest of the game.

===Windows version===
The Windows version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was released in North America on September 22, 2000, in the United Kingdom on October 20, 2000, and in other European and Asian territories (excluding Japan) in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Games and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports the use of a keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The Windows version is labeled &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; on the packaging, but the actual game uses the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Integral&quot; logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of &quot;Integral&quot; and lacks some of its content. The most significant change was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus eliminating the need for a stand-alone third disc.

One notable omission was the removal of the cutscene before the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player&#x27;s memory card and activates the vibration function of the player&#x27;s controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include the removal of the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl&#x27;s alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the Windows version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quicksaves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the opening video and the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.

Scoring 83 on Metacritic&#x27;s aggregate, the game was criticized for &quot;graphic glitches,&quot; the aged nature of the port, and being virtually identical to the PlayStation version.

=== Remake ===
A remake, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, was developed by Silicon Knights under the supervision of KCE Japan and released for the GameCube in North America, Japan, and Europe in March 2004. Although &quot;Twin Snakes&quot; was primarily developed at Silicon Knights, its cutscenes were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing bullet time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively. While the storyline and settings of the game were unchanged (although a select few lines of dialog were re-written more closely resembling the original Japanese version), a variety of gameplay features from &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; were added such as the first-person aiming and hanging from bars on walls. Another change in the English voice acting was the reduction of Mei Ling&#x27;s, Naomi&#x27;s and Nastasha&#x27;s accents, as well as the recasting of Gray Fox from Greg Eagles, who still reprises the role of the DARPA chief, to Rob Paulsen. The graphics were also updated to match those of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;.

=== &quot;Master Collection&quot; version ===
The original version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was re-released in October 2023 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and Windows (via Steam) as part of a series of re-releases titled the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection&quot;. The title is available as stand-alone download with the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; included as bonuses, with all three titles also included as part of a compilation titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1&quot; along with re-releases of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; (both available as separate downloads as well).

In the &quot;Master Collection&quot;, the game runs on an emulator developed by M2, with the option to play any of the seven regional versions (Japanese, North American, European English, German, French, Italian and Spanish) of the game via additional downloads, as well as the &quot;Integral&quot;/&quot;VR Missions&quot;/&quot;Special Missions&quot; expansions. The &quot;Master Collection&quot; edition handles the Psycho Mantis&#x27; mind reading event by giving the player option to create a virtual memory card with save files from supported games in order to trigger specific lines of dialogue. There&#x27;s also a new animated sequence when the player reaches the blast furnace which visually depicts the disc-swapping process.

A Japanese radio drama version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, directed by Shuyo Murata and written by Motosada Mori, was produced shortly after the release of the original PlayStation game. 12 episodes were aired, from 1998 to 1999 on Konami&#x27;s &quot;CLUB db&quot; program. The series was later released on CD as a two-volume series titled &quot;Drama CD Metal Gear Solid&quot;. Set after the events of the PlayStation game, Snake, Meryl, Campbell and Mei Ling (all portrayed by their original Japanese voice actors) pursue missions in hostile third world nations as FOXHOUND. The new characters introduced include Sgt. Allen Iishiba (voiced by Toshio Furukawa), a Delta Force operative who assists Snake and Meryl, Col. Mark Cortez (v.b. Osamu Saka), an old friend of Campbell who commands the fictional Esteria Army Special Forces, and Capt. Sergei Ivanovich (v.b. Kazuhiro Nakata), a former war buddy of Revolver Ocelot from his SVR days.

In September 2004, IDW Publications began publishing a series of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; comics, written by Kris Oprisko and illustrated by Ashley Wood. The comic was published bimonthly until 2006, lasting 12 issues fully covering the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; storyline. The comic was adapted into a PlayStation Portable game, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel&quot; (&quot;Metal Gear Solid: Bande Dessinée&quot; in Japan). It features visual enhancements and two interactive modes designed to give further insight into the publication. Upon viewing the pages, the player can open a &quot;scanning&quot; interface to search for characters and items in a three-dimensional view. Discoveries are added to a database which can be traded with other players via Wi-Fi. The &quot;mission mode&quot; allows the player to add collected information into a library. This information must be properly connected to complete a mission. &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel&quot; was released in North America on June 13, 2006, Japan on September 21 and the PAL region on September 22. In 2006, the game received IGN&#x27;s award for Best Use of Sound on the PSP. A DVD-Video version is included with its sequel (&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée&quot;), which was released in Japan on June 12, 2008. The DVD version features full voice acting.

A novelization based on the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was written by Raymond Benson and published by Del Rey. The American paperback edition was published on May 27, 2008, and the British Edition on June 5, 2008.

A second novelization by Kenji Yano (written under the pen name Hitori Nojima), &quot;Metal Gear Solid Substance I&quot;, was published by Kadokawa Shoten in Japan on August 25, 2015. This novelization is narrated through a text file written by a young man living in Manhattan in 2009 (the present year of the Plant chapter in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;). The story also acknowledges certain plot elements from &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; regarding certain characters such as Liquid Snake and Psycho Mantis.

==Reception==
Prior to release, the game&#x27;s demonstrations at several trade shows between 1996 and 1998 had received a positive response. This had generated significant worldwide interest in the game prior to its release in 1998.

The review by &quot;IGN&quot; opined &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; came &quot;closer to perfection than any other game in PlayStation&#x27;s action genre&quot; and called it &quot;beautiful, engrossing, and innovative...in every conceivable category.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; compared it to &quot;playing a big budget action blockbuster, only better.&quot; &quot;Arcade&quot; magazine praised it for &quot;introducing a brand new genre: the sneak-&#x27;em-up&quot; and said it would &quot;herald a tidal wave&quot; of &quot;sneak-&#x27;em-ups.&quot; They called it a &quot;brilliant, technically stunning, well thought through release that&#x27;s sure to influence action adventure games for many years.&quot; &quot;GMR&quot; called it a &quot;cinematic classic.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;this season&#x27;s top offering [game] and one game no self-respecting gamer should be without,&quot; but criticized the frame rate that &quot;occasionally stalls the eye-catching graphics.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; was critical of how easy it is for the player to avoid being seen, as well as the game&#x27;s short length, calling it &quot;more of a work of art than ... an actual game.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;rest assured that this is a game no player should miss and the best reason yet to own a PlayStation.&quot;

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1998 Japan Media Arts Festival.

Prior to its North American release, an estimated 12 million demos for the game were distributed in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konami / M2 Presswire-1998&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, the game was a commercial success. It became one of the most rented games in the United States, and topped sales charts in the United Kingdom and Japan.

[...] I didn&#x27;t think at all of how to make this game sell well, because I didn&#x27;t expect it to sell.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; is credited with popularizing the stealth game genre. The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies rather than fight them has been used in many games since. It is also sometimes acclaimed as being a film as much as a game due to the lengthy cutscenes and complicated storyline. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;the founder of the stealth genre.&quot;

The game is often considered one of the best games for the PlayStation and was featured in best video games lists by &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 2000, by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2001, by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; in 2004, by GameFAQs and &quot;GamePro&quot; in 2005, and by &quot;Famitsu&quot;. &quot;Hyper&quot; magazine in 2001 called it &quot;Probably the single best game on the PlayStation.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it as the best PlayStation game ever, stating that just the demo for the game had &quot;more gameplay [in it] than in most finished titles.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; also gave it the &quot;Best Ending&quot; and &quot;Best Villain&quot; awards. In 2005, in placing it 19th on their list of &quot;Top 100 Games&quot;, they said that it was &quot;a game that truly felt like a movie.&quot; &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; awarded &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; with a record for the &quot;Most Innovative Use of a Video Game Controller&quot; for the boss fight with Psycho Mantis in the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; 2008 edition. In 2010, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; ranked it as seventh in the list of most influential video games of all time, citing its influence on &quot;such stealthy titles as &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time and G4tv ranked it as the 45th top video game of all time.

According to &quot;1UP.com&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;&#x27;s cinematic style continues to influence modern action games such as &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, along with its sequel, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, was featured in the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s exhibition The Art of Video Games in 2012. During August 2015, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reanalyzed the game&#x27;s technical and overall impact and claimed that &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; had been nothing less than &quot;the first modern video game.&quot; In September 2015, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was voted the best original PlayStation game of all time by &quot;PlayStation.Blog&#x27;s&quot; users. In May 2023, &quot;GQ&quot; listed &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as the seventh best video game of all time according to a team of video game journalists across the industry.

<text>A periscope is an instrument for observation over, around or through an object, obstacle or condition that prevents direct line-of-sight observation from an observer&#x27;s current position.

In its simplest form, it consists of an outer case with mirrors at each end set parallel to each other at a 45° angle. This form of periscope, with the addition of two simple lenses, served for observation purposes in the trenches during World War I. Military personnel also use periscopes in some gun turrets and in armoured vehicles.

More complex periscopes using prisms or advanced fiber optics instead of mirrors and providing magnification operate on submarines and in various fields of science. The overall design of the classical submarine periscope is very simple: two telescopes pointed into each other. If the two telescopes have different individual magnification, the difference between them causes an overall magnification or reduction.

==Early examples==
Johannes Hevelius described an early periscope (which he called a &quot;polemoscope&quot;) with lenses in 1647 in his work &quot;Selenographia, sive Lunae descriptio&quot; [Selenography, or an account of the Moon]. Hevelius saw military applications for his invention.

Mikhail Lomonosov invented an &quot;optical tube&quot; which was similar to a periscope. In 1834, it was used in a submarine, designed by Karl Andreevich Schilder.

In 1854, Hippolyte Marié-Davy invented the first naval periscope, consisting of a vertical tube with two small mirrors fixed at each end at 45°. Simon Lake used periscopes in his submarines in 1902. Sir Howard Grubb perfected the device in World War I. Morgan Robertson (1861–1915) claimed to have tried to patent the periscope: he described a submarine using a periscope in his fictional works.

Periscopes, in some cases fixed to rifles, served in World War I (1914–1918) to enable soldiers to see over the tops of trenches, thus avoiding exposure to enemy fire (especially from snipers). The periscope rifle also saw use during the war – this was an infantry rifle sighted by means of a periscope, so the shooter could aim and fire the weapon from a safe position below the trench parapet.

During World War II (1939–1945), artillery observers and officers used specifically manufactured periscope binoculars with different mountings. Some of them also allowed estimating the distance to a target, as they were designed as stereoscopic rangefinders.

==Armored vehicle periscopes==
Tanks and armoured vehicles use periscopes: they enable drivers, tank commanders, and other vehicle occupants to inspect their situation through the vehicle roof. Prior to periscopes, direct vision slits were cut in the armour for occupants to see out. Periscopes permit view outside of the vehicle without needing to cut these weaker vision openings in the front and side armour, better protecting the vehicle and occupants.

A protectoscope is a related periscopic vision device designed to provide a window in armoured plate, similar to a direct vision slit. A compact periscope inside the protectoscope allows the vision slit to be blanked off with spaced armoured plate. This prevents a potential ingress point for small arms fire, with only a small difference in vision height, but still requires the armour to be cut.

In the context of armoured fighting vehicles, such as tanks, a periscopic vision device may also be referred to as an episcope. In this context a periscope refers to a device that can rotate to provide a wider field of view (or is fixed into an assembly that can), while an episcope is fixed into position.

Periscopes may also be referred to by slang, e.g. &quot;shufti-scope&quot;.

===Gundlach and Vickers 360-degree periscopes===
An important development, the Gundlach rotary periscope, incorporated a rotating top with a selectable additional prism which reversed the view. This allowed a tank commander to obtain a 360-degree field of view without moving his seat, including rear vision by engaging the extra prism. This design, patented by Rudolf Gundlach in 1936, first saw use in the Polish 7-TP light tank (produced from 1935 to 1939).

As a part of Polish–British pre-World War II military cooperation, the patent was sold to Vickers-Armstrong where it saw further development for use in British tanks, including the Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, and &quot;Cromwell&quot; models as the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV.

The Gundlach-Vickers technology was shared with the American Army for use in its tanks including the Sherman, built to meet joint British and US requirements. This saw post-war controversy through legal action: &quot;After the Second World War and a long court battle, in 1947 he, Rudolf Gundlach, received a large payment for his periscope patent from some of its producers.&quot;

The USSR also copied the design and used it extensively in its tanks, including the T-34 and T-70. The copies were based on Lend-Lease British vehicles, and many parts remain interchangeable. Germany also made and used copies.

===Periscopic gunsights===
Periscopic sights were also introduced during the Second World War. In British use, the Vickers periscope was provided with sighting lines, enabling front and rear prisms to be directly aligned to gain an accurate direction. On later tanks such as the Churchill and Cromwell, a similarly marked episcope provided a backup sighting mechanism aligned with a vane sight on the turret roof.

Later, US-built Sherman tanks and British Centurion and Charioteer tanks replaced the main telescopic sight with a true periscopic sight in the primary role. The periscopic sight was linked to the gun itself, allowing elevation to be captured (rotation being fixed as part of rotating turret). The sights formed part of the overall periscope, providing the gunner with greater overall vision than previously possible with the telescopic sight. The FV4201 Chieftain used the TESS (Telescopic Sighting System) developed in the early 1980s that was later sold as surplus for use on the RAF Phantom aircraft.

===Modern specialised AFV periscopes===
In modern use, specialised periscopes can also provide night vision. The Embedded Image Periscope (EIP) designed and patented by Kent Periscopes provides standard unity vision periscope functionality for normal daytime viewing of the vehicle surroundings plus the ability to display digital images from a range of on-vehicle sensors and cameras (including thermal and low light) such that the resulting image appears &quot;embedded&quot; internally within the unit and projected at a comfortable viewing position.

==Naval use==

Periscopes allow a submarine, when submerged at a relatively shallow depth, to search visually for nearby targets and threats on the surface of the water and in the air. When not in use, a submarine&#x27;s periscope retracts into the hull. A submarine commander in tactical conditions must exercise discretion when using his periscope, since it creates a visible wake (and may also become detectable by radar), giving away the submarine&#x27;s position.

Marie-Davey built a simple, fixed naval periscope using mirrors in 1854. Thomas H. Doughty of the United States Navy later invented a prismatic version for use in the American Civil War of 1861–1865.

Submarines adopted periscopes early. Captain Arthur Krebs adapted two on the experimental French submarine in 1888 and 1889. The Spanish inventor Isaac Peral equipped his submarine (developed in 1886 but launched on September 8, 1888) with a fixed, non-retractable periscope that used a combination of prisms to relay the image to the submariner. (Peral also developed a primitive gyroscope for submarine navigation and pioneered the ability to fire live torpedoes while submerged.)

The invention of the collapsible periscope for use in submarine warfare is usually credited to Simon Lake in 1902. Lake called his device the &quot;omniscope&quot; or &quot;skalomniscope&quot;.

 modern submarine periscopes incorporate lenses for magnification and function as telescopes. They typically employ prisms and total internal reflection instead of mirrors, because prisms, which do not require coatings on the reflecting surface, are much more rugged than mirrors. They may have additional optical capabilities such as range-finding and targeting. The mechanical systems of submarine periscopes typically use hydraulics and need to be quite sturdy to withstand the drag through water. The periscope chassis may also support a radio or radar antenna.

Submarines traditionally had two periscopes: a navigation or observation periscope and a targeting, or commander&#x27;s, periscope. Navies originally mounted these periscopes in the conning tower, one forward of the other in the narrow hulls of diesel-electric submarines. In the much wider hulls of US Navy submarines the two operate side-by-side. The observation scope, used to scan the sea surface and sky, typically had a wide field of view and no magnification or low-power magnification. The targeting or &quot;attack&quot; periscope, by comparison, had a narrower field of view and higher magnification. In World War II and earlier submarines, it was the only means of gathering target data to accurately fire a torpedo, since sonar was not yet sufficiently advanced for this purpose (ranging with sonar required emission of an acoustic &quot;ping&quot; that gave away the location of the submarine) and most torpedoes were unguided.

Twenty-first-century submarines do not necessarily have periscopes. The United States Navy&#x27;s s and the Royal Navy&#x27;s s instead use photonics masts, pioneered by the Royal Navy&#x27;s , which lift an electronic imaging sensor-set above the water. Signals from the sensor-set travel electronically to workstations in the submarine&#x27;s control center. While the cables carrying the signal must penetrate the submarine&#x27;s hull, they use a much smaller and more easily sealed—and therefore less expensive and safer—hull opening than those required by periscopes. Eliminating the telescoping tube running through the conning tower also allows greater freedom in designing the pressure hull and in placing internal equipment.

==Aircraft use==
Periscopes have also been used on aircraft for sections with limited view. The first known use of aircraft periscope was on the Spirit of St. Louis. The Vickers VC10 had a periscope that could be used on four locations of the aircraft fuselage, V-Bombers such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor and the Nimrod MR1 as the &quot;on top sight&quot;. Various US bomber aircraft such as the B-52 used sextant periscopes for celestial navigation before the introduction of GPS. This also allowed the aircrew to navigate without the use of an astrodome in the fuselage. An emergency periscope was used on all Boeing 737 models manufactured before 1997 found under &quot;Seat D&quot; behind the over wing exit row to regulate the landing gear. High speed and hypersonic aircraft such as the North American X-15 used a periscope.

<text>The dusky hopping mouse (Notomys fuscus), is a small rodent endemic to Australia, inhabiting desert regions characterised by sand dunes. Populations have experienced significant declines since the arrival of Europeans, and continue to be subject to threatening processes. It is currently listed as a threatened species.

== Taxonomy ==

The dusky hopping mouse, or Wilkinti, is a mammal in the order Rodentia, and suborder Sciurognathi. The species is in the family Muridae and the subfamily Murinae (includes all Australian native rats and mice). The dusky hopping mouse belongs to the genus &quot;Notomys&quot;, a group of desert-dwelling rodents.

The species was originally described as &quot;Ascopharynx fuscus&quot; (Wood Jones 1925) from a specimen collected in South Australia. Subsequent collections were described as &quot;Notomys fuscus eyreius&quot; in 1960. Hopping mice collected in Queensland between 1957 and 1959 were described as a new species, &quot;Notomys filmeri,&quot; however, later taxonomic investigation revealed these were &quot;Notomys fuscus.&quot;

== Description ==

The dusky hopping mouse has pale orange-brown upper parts, occasionally with grey tinged streaks. The under parts are grey-white. It grows to 80–115 mm long, with an average weight of 35 g. The tail is between 120 and 155 mm long, ending in a tuft of dark hairs. They have a well-developed throat pouch, with an opening surrounded by a fleshy margin with inward pointing, coarse white hairs. Its ears are large and furless for dissipating heat, and they have prominent dark eyes, and strong incisor teeth. It has short front legs, and long, elongated hind feet. with only three pads on the sole. Male reproductive anatomy is distinctive. The glans is small and tapered towards the tip. The surface has large dorsally projecting spines, with slightly curved tips. The testes are extremely small compared to other native rodents. Females have two pairs of inguinal teats.

== Distribution ==

The species historically inhabited large areas of central Australia, south-west Queensland, and far west South Australia, and Western Australia. Sub-fossil specimens were found in far-south South Australia, near the Flinders Ranges. Populations were recorded in the Northern Territory, however have not been observed since 1939. It is highly likely to have occurred in western New South Wales. Distribution has shown a marked decline of more than 90% since the arrival of Europeans, with populations now patchy and highly fragmented. It is currently thought to be restricted to the Cobblers Sandhills and Strzelecki Desert in north-east South Australia, south-west Queensland and far north-west New South Wales. The species was presumed to be extinct in New South Wales, before being re-discovered in Sturt National Park in 2003. Since then, a number of sightings have been recorded near Broken Hill, New South Wales.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat ===

The preferred habitat of the dusky hopping mouse is the crests and slopes of stabilised desert sand dunes and ridges, with sand required for digging burrows. Dense populations tend to occur only within the vicinity of major drainage systems. It does not appear to favour a particular vegetation type, occurring in dunes well-vegetated by canegrass (&quot;Zygochloa paradoxa&quot;), as well as degraded ecosystems dominated by ephemeral herbaceous species. It has also been associated with perennial shrub species such as nitre bush (&quot;Nitraria billardierei&quot;) and &quot;Acacia&quot; species.

=== Behaviour ===
The dusky hopping mouse is a social species, living in colonies of up to five individuals. They live in burrows consisting of vertical shafts with a series of entrances approximately 3 cm in diameter, leading to a network of horizontal tunnels and chambers extending up to 2m deep. &quot;Notomys&quot; species dig their burrows from below, resulting in an absence of loose sand surrounding the entrance holes. This species prefers to forage at night in sheltered microhabitats, rather than open areas, to avoid the risk of predation. It is an opportunistic, omnivorous feeder, however is considered a granivore (74% of the diet). Green plant material, insects, and fruits are also eaten. It does not need to drink water. The neck throat pouch is a glandular area, used for marking territories. Females may scent-mark their young, ensuring they acquire a smell that grants them acceptance within the colony.

=== Life cycle and reproduction ===
In the wild, lifespan has been recorded as being up to 13 months of age. In captivity, males and females reach reproductive maturity at 70 days of age. This species is likely monogamous, and females may display selectivity in choosing which males will sire offspring. Breeding is non-seasonal, occurring year-round, in both wet and dry conditions. Females are observed to be polyoestrous, with a gestation period of 32 to 38 days, and a litter size of one to five offspring. An average of 42 days occurs between litters, and the maximum reproductive life for females is approximately 24 months, and males 36 months. Subpopulations may persist at low but stable numbers, however others exhibit “boom-and-bust” variation, with numbers increasing and decreasing rapidly in response to rainfall and resource availability.

=== Dispersal and movement ===
When travelling slowly, hopping mice move on all fours, however they hop on the hind feet when travelling at speed. Individuals can disperse over large distances to colonise isolated habitats, crossing areas of hard unsuitable substrate. Foraging distances are up to 400m per night, extending up to 1.5 km over three nights. Individuals inhabiting degraded habitats with limited vegetation and food resources show lower mobility, whereas those inhabiting highly diverse habitats with a wide variety of resources have wider ranging movement patterns.

==Threats==

=== Predation ===

Introduced predators such as the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and feral cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) have detrimental impacts on dusky hopping mouse populations. Where cat and fox abundance is high, dusky hopping mouse populations decline. Cats target smaller prey such as rodents, which can make up a large proportion of their diet. Native species, such as the barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), frequently consume this species, as does the dingo. Dingoes may de-populate localised populations of hopping mice within months, particularly under drought conditions. Crest-tailed mulgara (&quot;Dasycercus cristicauda&quot;) have also been recorded eating this species.

=== Habitat degradation ===
Livestock, kangaroos and rabbits overgraze vegetation required for shelter and food sources, leading to scalding, wind and sheet erosion and a shift from perennial, to less productive ephemeral plant species. Livestock also damage habitats by trampling. Reduced food availability limits hopping mice abundance, and the availability of suitable habitat limits their distribution. However, higher annual rainfall and more productive ecosystems may buffer the effects of livestock, by providing more dependable and abundant resources, allowing mice to proliferate.
=== Competition ===
Competition for food and habitat occurs with the house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), which increase in abundance more rapidly under favourable conditions, depleting resources and outcompeting the native mice. The rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus)&quot; also competes with dusky hopping mice for food. Declines in rabbit abundance, and increased resources, following the release of the Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) in Australia in 1995, saw the dusky hopping mouse increased their extent of occurrence by 241 to 365% over 14 years.

=== Climate Change ===
This species experiences natural population declines during dry periods, when food resources are limited, and increase strongly following rainfall events. Decreases in rainfall, less frequent rainfall events and more frequent droughts under climate change may cause declines or extinctions. Predation of hopping mice by dingoes intensifies under drought conditions, which may significantly impact populations.

==Conservation status==
The total remaining population is estimated to be between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals.

<text>The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen&quot; II(abbreviated Pz.Kpfw. II&quot;).

Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger, more advanced tanks were developed, it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II, during the Polish and French campaigns. The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions at the beginning of the war. It was used both in North Africa against the Western Allies and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union.

The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV medium tanks by 1940/1941. By the end of 1942, it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts. The turrets of the then-obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers, particularly on the Atlantic Wall. Production of the tank itself ceased by January 1944, but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armoured vehicles, chiefly self-propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II respectively.

==Development==

In 1934, delays in the design and production of the Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks were becoming apparent. The Panzer I had no weapons capable of defeating armor and thus no chance of success against enemy tanks so a stopgap tank was developed. Designs for a stopgap tank were solicited from Krupp, MAN, Henschel, and Daimler-Benz. Design work on the Panzer II began on 27 January 1934. The first experimental model was ready in February 1935. The final design was based on the Panzer I, but larger, and with a turret mounting a 20 mm autocannon anti-tank gun and leaf spring suspension Production began in 1935, but it took another eighteen months for the first combat-ready tank to be delivered.

==Design==
===Armour===
The Panzer II was designed before the experience of the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39 showed that protection against armour-piercing shells was required for tanks to survive on a modern battlefield. Prior to that, armour was designed to stop machine gun fire and high-explosive shell fragments.
The Panzer II Ausf. A to C had 14 mm of slightly sloped homogeneous steel armour on the sides, front, and back, with 10 mm of armour on the top and bottom. Most of them were later given increased armour in the front of the vehicle, most noticeable by the changed appearance of the front hull from rounded to boxy shape. Starting with the D model, the front armour was increased to 30 mm. The Model F had 35 mm front armour and 20 mm side armour. This level of protection was still only proof against small arms fire. This amount of armour could be penetrated by towed anti-tank weapons, such as the Soviet 45mm, the British 2-pounder and the French &quot;canon de 47&quot;.

===Armament===
Most tank versions of the Panzer II were armed with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 auto-cannon. Some later versions used the similar 2 cm KwK 38 L/55. This auto-cannon was based on the 2 cm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun, and was capable of firing at a rate of 600 rounds per minute (280 rounds per minute sustained) from 10-round magazines. A total of 180 shells were carried.

The Panzer II also had a 7.92 mm &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; 34 machine gun mounted coaxially with the main gun.

The 2 cm autocannon proved to be ineffective against many Allied tanks even at the start of the war, and experiments were conducted with a view to replacing it with a 37 mm cannon, but nothing came of this. Prototypes were built with a 50 mm tank gun, but by then the Panzer II had outlived its usefulness as a tank regardless of armament. Greater success was had by replacing the standard 2 cm armour-piercing explosive ammunition with tungsten cored solid ammunition, but due to shortages of tungsten this ammunition was in chronically short supply.

===Mobility===

All production versions of the Panzer II were fitted with a 140 PS (138 HP), gasoline-fuelled six-cylinder Maybach HL62 TRM engine and ZF transmissions. Models A, B, and C had a top speed of 40 km/h (25 mph). Models D and E had a torsion bar suspension and a better transmission, giving a top road speed of 55 km/h (33 mph) but the cross country speed was much lower than previous models, so the Model F reverted to the previous leaf spring type suspension. All versions had a range of .

===Crew===
The Panzer II had a crew of three men. The driver sat in the forward left hull with the gearbox on the right. The commander sat in a seat in the turret, and was responsible for aiming and firing the cannon and co-axial machine gun, while a loader/radio operator sat on the floor of the tank behind the driver. He had a radio on the left and several 20mm ammunition storage bins.

==Variants==
===Development and limited production models===

;Panzer II Ausf. a (Pz.Kpfw. IIa)
Not to be confused with the later Ausf. A (the sole difference being the capitalization of the letter A), the Ausf. a was the first version of the Panzer II to be built (albeit in limited numbers), and was subdivided into three sub-variants. The Ausf. a/1 was initially built with a cast idler wheel with rubber tire, but this was replaced after ten production examples with a welded part. The Ausf. a/2 improved engine access problems. The Ausf. a/3 included improved suspension and engine cooling. In general, the specifications for the Ausf. a models was similar, and a total of 75 were produced from May 1936 to February 1937 by Daimler-Benz and MAN. The Ausf. a was considered the 1 Serie under the LaS 100 name.

;Panzer II Ausf. b (Pz.Kpfw. II b)
Again, not to be confused with the later Ausf. B, the Ausf. b was the second limited production series embodying further developments, primarily a heavy reworking of suspension components resulting in a wider track and a longer hull. Length was increased to 4.76 metres but width and height were unchanged. Additionally, a Maybach HL62 TR engine was used with new drivetrain components to match. Deck armour for the superstructure and turret roof was increased to 10–12 mm. Total weight increased to 7.9 tonnes. Twenty-five were built by Daimler-Benz and MAN in February and March 1937.

;Panzer II Ausf. c (Pz.Kpfw. II c)
As the last of the developmental limited production series of Panzer IIs, the Ausf. c came very close to matching the mass production configuration with the replacement of the six small road wheels with five larger independently sprung road wheels and an additional return roller. The tracks were further modified and the fenders widened. Total length increased to and width to . At least 25 of this model were produced from March through July 1937.

===Main production models===
;Panzer II Ausf. A, B and C

The first true production model, the Ausf. A, included an armour upgrade to on all sides, as well as a 14.5 mm floor plate, and an improved transmission. It entered production in July 1937 and was superseded by the Ausf. B in December 1937, which introduced only minimal changes.

A few minor changes were made in the Ausf. C version, which became the standard production model from June 1938 through April 1940. A total of 1,113 examples of Ausf. c, A, B, and C tanks were built from March 1937 through April 1940 by Alkett, FAMO, Daimler-Benz, Henschel, MAN, MIAG, and Wegmann. These models were almost identical and were used in service interchangeably. This was the most widespread tank version of the Panzer II. Earlier versions of Ausf. C have a rounded hull front, but many had additional armour plates bolted on the turret and hull front. Some were also retro-fitted with commander&#x27;s cupolas.

;Panzer II Ausf. D and E
With a completely new torsion bar suspension with four road wheels, the Ausf. D was developed as a tank for use in the light divisions. After the invasion of Poland the light divisions were converted to Panzer divisions. Only the turret was the same as the Ausf. C model, with a new hull and superstructure design and the use of a Maybach HL62TRM engine driving a seven-gear transmission (plus reverse). The design was shorter (4.65 m) but wider (2.3 m) and taller (2.06 m) than the Ausf. C. Speed was increased to 55 km/h. A total of 43 Ausf. D tanks were built from October 1938 through March 1939 by MAN, and they served in Poland. They were withdrawn in March 1940 for conversion to the flame tank Panzer II (&quot;Flamm&quot;). The Ausf. E differed from the Ausf. D by having lubricated tracks; seven chassis were completed.

;Panzer II Ausf. F
Continuing the conventional design of the Ausf. C, the Ausf. F superstructure front was made from a single piece of armour plate with a redesigned visor. Also, a dummy visor was placed next to it to confuse enemy gunners. The hull was redesigned with a flat plate on its front, and the armour of the superstructure and turret were built up to on the front with to the sides and rear. There was some minor alteration of the suspension and a new commander&#x27;s cupola as well. Weight increased to 9.5 tonnes. From March 1941 to July 1942, 509 were built; this was the final major tank version of the Panzer II series.
;Panzer II (&quot;Flamm&quot;)
Based on the same suspension as the Ausf. D and Ausf. E tank versions, the Flamm (often wrongly referred to as &quot;Flamingo&quot;) used a new turret mounting a single MG34 machine gun, and two remotely controlled flamethrowers mounted in small turrets at each front corner of the vehicle. Each flamethrower could cover the front 180° arc, while the turret traversed 360°.

The flamethrowers were supplied with 320 litres of fuel and four tanks of compressed nitrogen. The nitrogen tanks were built into armoured boxes along each side of the superstructure. Armour was 30 mm to the front and 14.5 mm to the side and rear, although the turret was increased to 20 mm at the sides and rear.

Total weight was 12 tonnes and dimensions were increased to a length of 4.9 m and width of 2.4 m although it was a bit shorter at 1.85 m tall. A FuG2 radio was carried.

One hundred and fifty-one Panzerkampfwagen II (F) (&quot;Flamm&quot;) vehicles were built from April 1940 through March 1942. Initial production of Ausf. A vehicles was based on 46 Panzer II Ausf. D/E chassis that were never completed as tanks, in March 1940 the 43 still existing Panzer II Ausf. D were recalled for conversion and from August 1941 until the cancellation in March 1942 a further 62 Ausf. B vehicles were made from new-production Ausf. D chassis (out of an order for 150 vehicles). The Panzer II (F) was deployed in the USSR, but was not very successful due to its limited armor, and survivors were soon withdrawn for conversion to Marder II tank destroyers in December 1941.

It is unknown when exactly the Flammpanzer II got the name &quot;Flamingo&quot;, however it most likely originated some time after World War 2 and was never officially used for the vehicle.

;Panzer II Ausf. L &quot;Luchs&quot;

A light reconnaissance tank, the Ausf. L was the only Panzer II design with the &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; overlapping/interleaved road wheels and &quot;slack track&quot; configuration to enter series production, with 100 being built from September 1943 to January 1944 in addition to the conversion of the four Ausf. M tanks. Originally given the experimental designation VK 1303, it was adopted under the alternate name &quot;Panzerspähwagen&quot; II and given the popular name &quot;Luchs&quot; (&quot;Lynx&quot;). The &quot;Luchs&quot; was larger than the Ausf. G in most dimensions (length 4.63 m; height 2.21 m; width 2.48 m). It was equipped with a six speed transmission (plus reverse), and could reach a speed of with a range of . The FuG12 and FuG &quot;Spr a&quot; radios were installed, while 330 rounds of 20 mm and 2,250 rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition were carried. Total vehicle weight was 11.8 tonnes. It had 30 mm of armour on the front of the hull and 20 mm of armour on the sides and back and the same on the turret. It accommodated four crew members, the commander (gunner), driver, loader and the radio operator.

===Self-propelled guns on Panzer II chassis===
;15 cm sIG 33 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sf)

One of the first gun mount variants of the Panzer II design was to emplace a 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry gun on a turret-less Panzer II chassis. The prototype utilized an Ausf. B tank chassis, but it was quickly realized that it was not sufficient for the mounting. A new, longer chassis incorporating an extra road wheel was designed and built, named the Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II. An open-topped 15 mm thick armored superstructure sufficient against small arms and shrapnel was provided around the gun. This was not high enough to give full protection for the crew while manning the gun, although they were still covered directly to the front by the tall gun shield. Only 12 were built in November and December 1941. These served with the 707th and 708th Heavy Infantry Gun Companies in North Africa until their destruction in 1943.

;7.62 cm PaK 36(r) auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. D/E (Marder II) (Sd.Kfz. 132)

After a lack of success with conventional and flame tank variants on the Ausf. D/E chassis, it was decided to use the remaining chassis to mount captured Soviet antitank guns. The hull and suspension was unmodified from the earlier models, but the superstructure was built up to provide a large, open-topped fighting compartment with a Soviet 76.2 mm antitank gun, which, while not turreted, did have significant traverse. Only developed as an interim solution, the vehicle was clearly too tall and poorly protected, but had a powerful weapon.

;7.5 cm PaK 40 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Marder II) (Sd.Kfz. 131)

While the 7.62 cm PaK 36(r) was a good stopgap measure, the 7.5 cm PaK 40 mounted on the tank chassis of the Ausf. F resulted in a better overall fighting machine. New production amounted to 576 examples from June 1942 to June 1943, as well as the conversion of 75 tanks after new production had stopped. The work was done by Daimler-Benz, FAMO, and MAN. A much improved superstructure for the 7.62 cm mounting was built giving a lower profile. The Marder II served with the Germans on all fronts through the end of the war.

;5 cm PaK 38 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II
Conceived along the same lines as the Marder II, the 5 cm PaK 38 was an expedient solution to mount the 50 mm antitank gun on the Panzer II chassis. However, the much greater effectiveness of the 75 mm antitank gun made this option less desirable. Production quantity is unknown.

;Leichte Feldhaubitze 18 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Wespe)
After the development of the &quot;Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II&quot; for mounting the sIG 33, Alkett designed a version mounting a 10.5 cm &quot;leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2&quot; field howitzer in an open-topped superstructure. This was Germany&#x27;s only widely produced self-propelled 105 mm howitzer. Between February 1943 and June 1944, 676 were built by FAMO, and it served on all major fronts.

;Munitions Selbstfahrlafette auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II
To support the Wespe in operation, 159 Wespe chassis were completed without installation of the howitzer, instead functioning as ammunition carriers. They carried 90 rounds of 105 mm calibre. These could be converted to normal Wespes by installation of the leFH 18 in the field if needed.

===Limited production, experiments and prototypes===
;&quot;Panzerkampfwagen II mit Schwimmkörper&quot;
One of Germany&#x27;s first attempts at developing an amphibious tank, the &quot;Schwimmkörper&quot; was a device built by Gebr Sachsenberg that consisted of two large pontoons, with one attached to each side of a Panzer II tank. The tanks were specially sealed, some modifications to the engine exhaust and cooling were needed, as was an inflatable rubber ring used to seal the turret during amphibious operation. A propeller; linked by a universal joint to an extension, was linked to the tank&#x27;s engine to provide motive power, steering in water being effected by a rudder mounted behind the propeller. Speeds of up to 6 mph in dead calm were claimed, as was the ability to cope with conditions up to sea state 4. Once ashore the pontoons were detachable. The modified tanks were issued to the 18th Panzer Regiment, which was formed in 1940. However, with cancellation of Operation Sealion, the plan to invade England, the tanks were used in the conventional manner by the regiment on the Eastern Front.

;Panzer II Ausf. G (PzKpfw II G)
The fourth and final suspension configuration used for the Panzer II tanks was the five overlapping road wheel configuration termed &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; by the Germans. This was used as the basis for the redesign of the Panzer II into a reconnaissance tank with high speed and good off-road performance. The Ausf. G was the first Panzer II to use this configuration, and was developed under the experimental designation VK 9.01. There is no record of the Ausf. G being issued to combat units, and only 12 full vehicles were built from April 1941 to February 1942 by MAN. The turrets were subsequently issued for use in fortifications. Two were converted to use the 50mm Pak 38 and troop-tested on the Eastern Front.

;Panzer II Ausf. H (Pz.Kpfw. II H)
Given experimental designation VK 9.03, the Ausf. H was intended as the production model of the Ausf. G, with armor for the sides and rear increased to 20 mm and a new four speed transmission (plus reverse) similar to that of the PzKpfw 38(t) nA. Only two prototypes were ever completed by the time of cancellation in September 1942.

;&quot;Brückenleger auf Panzerkampfwagen&quot; II
After failed attempts to use the Panzer I as a chassis for a bridge layer, work moved to the Panzer II, led by Magirus. It is not known how many of these conversions were made, but four were known to have been in service with the 7th Panzer Division in May 1940.

;Panzer II Ausf. J (Pz.Kpfw. II J)
Continued development of the reconnaissance tank concept led to the much up-armoured Ausf. J, which used the same concept as the Panzer I Ausf. F of the same period, under the experimental designation VK 16.01. Heavier armour was added, bringing protection up to 80 mm on the front (similar to the maximum armour found on the KV-1 model 1941 Soviet heavy tank) and 50 mm to the sides and rear, with 25 mm roof and floor plates, increasing total weight to 18 tonnes. Equipped with the same Maybach HL45 P as the Pz.Kpfw. I F, top speed was reduced to . Primary armament was the 2 cm KwK 38 L/55 gun. 22 were produced by MAN between April and December 1942, and seven were issued to the 12th Panzer Division on the Eastern Front.

;&quot;Bergepanzerwagen auf Panzerkampfwagen&quot; II &quot;Ausf&quot;. J
A single example of an Ausf. J with a jib in place of its turret was found operating as an armoured recovery vehicle. There is no record of an official program for this vehicle.

;Panzer II Ausf. M (Pz.Kpfw. II M)
Using the same chassis as the Ausf. H and the turret and superstructure of the Ausf. L &quot;Luchs&quot;, the Ausf. M would have had four crew; however, no examples are known to have been constructed.

;&quot;Panzerkampfwagen&quot; II &quot;ohne Aufbau&quot;
One use for obsolete Panzer II tanks that had their turrets removed for use in fortifications was as utility carriers. A number of chassis not used for conversion to self-propelled guns were instead handed over to the Engineers for use as personnel and equipment carriers.

;&quot;Panzer Selbstfahrlafette&quot; 1c
Developed in prototype form only, this was one of three abortive attempts to use the Panzer II chassis for mounting a 5 cm PaK 38 gun, this time on the chassis of the Ausf. G. Two examples were produced which had similar weight to the tank version, and both were put in front-line service, but production was not undertaken as priority was given to heavier armed models.
; VK 16.02 “Leopard”

The VK 16.02 was intended to be the 5 cm KwK 39-armed replacement for the Ausf. L, with a Maybach HL157 P engine driving an eight speed transmission (plus reverse). While the hull was based on that of the Pz.Kpfw. II J, it was redesigned after the Panzer V Panther, most noticeably with the introduction of fully sloped frontal armour. Was rejected after developers realized that Panzer IVs and Vs could do similar work without the need for a new vehicle.

<text>The United Nations System consists of the United Nations&#x27; six principal bodies (the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Trusteeship Council, International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the United Nations Secretariat), the specialized agencies and related organizations. The UN System includes subsidiary bodies such as the separately administered funds and programmes, research and training institutes, and other subsidiary entities. Some of these organizations predate the founding of the United Nations in 1945 and were inherited after the dissolution of the League of Nations.

The executive heads of some of the United Nations System, organizations and the World Trade Organization, which is not formally part of the United Nations System, have seats on the United Nations System Chief Executives&#x27; Board for Coordination (CEB). This body, chaired by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, meets twice a year to co-ordinate the work of the organizations of the United Nations System.

== Six principal organs ==
The United Nations itself has six principal organs established by the Charter of the United Nations:
===General Assembly===
The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA/GA) consists of all United Nations Member States and meets in regular session once a year under a president elected from among the representatives. Its powers are to oversee the budget of the United Nations, appoint the non-permanent members to the Security Council, receive reports from other parts of the United Nations and make recommendations in the form of General Assembly Resolutions. It has also established a wide number of subsidiary organs.

===Security Council===
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security. Its powers, outlined in the United Nations Charter, include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action. Its powers are exercised through United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The Security Council held its first ever session on 17 January 1946 at Church House, Westminster, London. Since its first meeting, the council, which exists in continuous session, has travelled widely, holding meetings in many cities, such as Paris and Addis Ababa, as well as at its current permanent home at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.

There are 15 members of the Security Council, consisting of five veto-wielding permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 10 elected non-permanent members with two-year terms. This basic structure is set out in Chapter V of the UN Charter. Security Council members must always be present at UN headquarters in New York so that the Security Council can meet at any time.

===Economic and Social Council===
The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for co-ordinating the economic, social, and related work of 15 UN specialized agencies, their functional commissions and five regional commissions. ECOSOC has 54 members; it holds a four-week session each year in July. Since 1998, it has also held a meeting each April with finance ministers heading key committees of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The ECOSOC serves as the central forum for discussing international economic and social issues, and for formulating policy recommendations addressed to member states and the United Nations System.

===Secretariat===
The United Nations Secretariat is headed by the United Nations Secretary-General, assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide. It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, the UN Economic and Social Council, and other U.N. bodies. The United Nations Charter provides that the staff is to be chosen by application of the &quot;highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity,&quot; with due regard for the importance of recruiting on a wide geographical basis.

The charter provides that the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any authority other than the UN. Each UN member country is enjoined to respect the international character of the secretariat and not seek to influence its staff. The secretary-general alone is responsible for staff selection.

*Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
* United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
* United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (UN-OIOS)
* United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR, formerly UNISDR)

===International Court of Justice===
The International Court of Justice is the primary judicial organ of the United Nations. It is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. Its main functions are to settle legal disputes submitted to it by states and to provide advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by duly authorized international organs, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.

===Trusteeship Council===
The United Nations Trusteeship Council, one of the principal organs of the United Nations, was established to ensure that trust territories were administered in the best interests of their inhabitants and of international peace and security. The trust territories—most of them are former mandates of the League of Nations or territories taken from nations defeated at the end of World War II—have all now attained self-government or independence, either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries. The last was Palau, formerly part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which became a member state of the United Nations in December 1994.

== Funds and programmes, research and training institutes, and other bodies ==
The separately administered funds and programmes, research and training institutes, and other subsidiary bodies are autonomous subsidiary organs of the United Nations.

=== Funds and programmes ===
Throughout its history the United Nations General Assembly has established a number of programmes and funds to address particular humanitarian and development concerns. These are financed through voluntary rather than assessed contributions. These bodies usually report to the General Assembly through an executive board. Only one UN programme has ever closed in the history of the organization, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which ceased to exist in 1959 and was subsequently replaced by the UNHCR.

Each of the funds and programmes is headed by an executive director at the under-secretary-general level and is governed by an executive board. One former fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), was merged with other elements of the United Nations System into a new organization, UN Women, in January 2011.
===Research and training institutes===
Various institutes were established by the General Assembly to perform independent research and training. One former institute, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), was merged with other elements of the United Nations System into a new organization, UN Women, in January 2011.
* United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR)
* United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)
* United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI)
* United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)
*United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC)
* United Nations University (UNU)

===Secretariats of conventions===
* Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
* UNCCD – United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
* UNFCCC – United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
* CBD – Convention on Biological Diversity
* UNCLOS – United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea established bodies:
** ISA – International Seabed Authority
** ITLOS – International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
* UNCRC - United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child

===Other entities and bodies===
* Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
* International Trade Centre (ITC)
* United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)
* United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
==Specialized agencies==

The specialized agencies are autonomous organizations working with the United Nations and each other through the co-ordinating machinery of the Economic and Social Council and the Chief Executives Board for Coordination. Each was integrated into the UN System by way of an agreement with the UN under UN Charter article 57 (except ICSID and MIGA, both part of the World Bank Group).
* Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
* International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
* International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
* International Labour Organization (ILO)
* International Maritime Organization (IMO)
* International Monetary Fund (IMF)
* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
* United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
* United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
* Universal Postal Union (UPU)
* World Bank Group (WBG)
** International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
** International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
** International Development Association (IDA)
** International Finance Corporation (IFC)
** Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
* World Health Organization (WHO)
* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
* World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
* United Nations World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism)
* &quot;International Refugee Organization (IRO); ceased to exist in 1952&quot;

==Related organizations==
Some organizations have a relationship with the UN defined by an arrangement different from the agreements between the specialized agencies and the UN, which are established under Articles 57 and 63 of the United Nations Charter.

===International Organization for Migration (IOM)===
The IOM, established in 1951, is the leading inter-governmental organization in the field of migration and works closely with governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental partners. IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, including refugees and internally displaced people. In September 2016, IOM joined the United Nations System as a related organization during the United Nations General Assembly high-level summit to address large movements of refugees and migrants.

===Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission (CTBTO PrepCom)===
The CTBTO PrepCom reports to the UN General Assembly.

===International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)===
The relationship between the IAEA and the UN was established by a resolution of the UN General Assembly. Unlike the specialized agencies which report to ECOSOC, the IAEA reports to the General Assembly as well as the Security Council. Like the other specialized agency&#x27;s heads, their executives are part of the United Nations System Chief Executives&#x27; Board for Coordination (CEB).

===Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)===
The OPCW is not an agency of the United Nations, but cooperates both on policy and practical issues. On 7 September 2000 the OPCW and the UN signed a co-operation agreement outlining how they were to co-ordinate their activities. Under this agreement, the OPCW reports to the UN General Assembly.

===World Trade Organization (WTO)===
The WTO does not have a formal agreement with the UN. Instead, their relationship is governed by exchanges of letters. Unlike the specialized agencies and the IAEA, the WTO has no reporting obligations towards any of the principal organs of the UN, but provides contribution to the work of the General Assembly and ECOSOC. The WTO has a seat on the CEB.

==Chief Executives Board and Senior Management Group==
The United Nations Chief Executives&#x27; Board for Coordination (CEB) brings together on a regular basis the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations System, under the chairmanship of the secretary-general of the UN. The CEB aims to further co-ordination and co-operation on a whole range of substantive and management issues facing UN System organizations. In addition to its regular reviews of contemporary political issues and major concerns facing the UN System, the CEB approves policy statements on behalf of the UN System as a whole. Three committees report to the CEB, namely the High-level Committee on Programme (HCLP), the High-level Committee on Management (HCLM) and the United Nations Development Group (UNDG). Each of those bodies has, in turn, developed a subsidiary machinery of regular and bodies on the substantive and managerial aspects of inter-agency co-ordination. The committee structure is supported by a CEB secretariat located in New York and Geneva.

There is also a Senior Management Group, composed of some of the senior officials in the secretariat and the funds and programmes at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General rank, which serves as the cabinet of the Secretary-General.

==United Nations common system==
The United Nations, its subsidiary bodies, thirteen of the specialized agencies (ILO, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, ICAO, UPU, ITU, WMO, IMO, WIPO, IFAD, UNIDO, and UNWTO), and one related body (IAEA) are part of the United Nations common system of salaries, allowances, and benefits administered by the International Civil Service Commission. Most, but not all, of the members of the United Nations System are part of the common system; the Bretton Woods institutions (i.e. the World Bank Group and the IMF) are notable exceptions. The WTO utilizes the OECD common system. The UN common system was established to prevent competition amongst organizations of the United Nations System for staff and to facilitate co-operation and exchange between organizations.

Some international organizations that are not part of the United Nations System (and therefore not members of the common system) but who voluntarily follow the policies of the common system in whole or in part include:
* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
* Organization of American States (OAS)

<doc id="216035" wikidata="Q1524758" url="?curid=216035" title="Rural Municipality of Gimli">
<text>The Rural Municipality of Gimli is a rural municipality located in the Interlake Region of south-central Manitoba, Canada, on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg. It is about north of the provincial capital Winnipeg. The rural municipality&#x27;s population in the 2016 Canadian Census was 6,181, making it the 12th largest rural municipality by population. The RM of Gimli has an area of , making it the sixth smallest rural municipality by area.

The unincorporated community of Gimli and the surrounding district were once an Icelandic ethnic block settlement, and the area, known as &quot;New Iceland&quot;, is home to the largest concentration of people of Icelandic ancestry outside Iceland. It also has significant Ukrainian and German communities, at 12% and 6% respectively.

The Town of Winnipeg Beach lies adjacent to its southeast corner, on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, between it and the Rural Municipality of St. Andrews to the south.

==History==

The Rural Municipality of Gimli was first settled by a large group of Icelandic settlers who arrived in New Iceland on Lake Winnipeg in the 1870s. Other settlements established beyond the community of Gimli with further fisheries based settlements at Arnes, Hnausa, Beyond the borders of Manitoba as it was then, this settlement fell within the District of Keewatin, until 1881 when Manitoba was enlarged. In 1897, the Gimli area was opened up to homesteaders and saw a surge of settlers from Ukraine, Poland, Hungary and Germany. Originally organized as a self-administering &quot;Icelandic reserve&quot; directly responsible to Ottawa, the settlers of New Iceland developed a unique constitution of by-laws for local government which remained in effect until 1887. The initial status of New Iceland as a &quot;reserve&quot; remained in effect until 1899.

Fishing was always a primary source of income for those in the riding since the arrival of the original settlers of New Iceland. Some of the production of the fish occurred outside of the town of Gimli, such as the now abandoned fish processing plant in Arnes, Manitoba, that was built in 1951.

In the Gimli Glider incident on 23 July 1983, an Air Canada Boeing 767 en route from Montreal to Edmonton ran out of fuel and made an unpowered landing on a decommissioned runway (converted to a drag strip) at Gimli Industrial Park Airport, a former RCAF base near Gimli with no control tower and no fire trucks available. A reenactment of the incident aired on Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mayday&quot; series and on Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Urban Legends&quot; series.

The Town of Gimli amalgamated with the Rural Municipality of Gimli on January 1, 2003.

==Communities==

* Camp Morton
* Gimli
* Husavik

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Gimli had a population of 6,569 living in 3,141 of its 4,793 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 6,181. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2016, the average age of RM of Gimli residents was 51.4 years old, this was well over the provincial average of 39.4 The percentage of the population 65 years or older was 33.5% of the population, this was nearly double the provincial average of 15.6% of the population in the age bracket.

RM of Gimli residents claim Icelandic heritage as the fourth largest ethnic background with 20.7% of the entire rural municipality claiming some Icelandic background or 1,250 people, behind English, Scottish, and Ukrainians in the top three.

==Economy==
Fishing has historically been the main economic driver in the Rural Municipality of Gimli. There are over 100 commercial fishers in the RM of Gimli, catching mainly pickerel in the south basin and white fish in the north basin. During the summer months, tourism is a major industry, as thousands of summer cottagers fill the Rural Municipality of Gimli, especially on weekends. Hotels, restaurants and stores cater to the summer visitors. Agriculture has also been a driver of the economy in the rural municipality.

==Arts and culture==

With a large and historic Icelandic culture along the shore of Lake Winnipeg from Husavik north to Hnausa, there are many celebrations and recognition of this heritage throughout the year and the communities in the RM of Gimli. Most of these are celebrated in the town of Gimli itself, though others can be found in the other settlements throughout the RM of Gimli. Aside from the Icelandic heritage, there is also a visible Ukrainian cultural history in the rural municipality with a few churches and cemeteries across the landscape.

<text>In certain civil law jurisdictions (e.g., France, Quebec, Mexico, etc.), the patrimoine d&#x27;affectation is property, assets, or a legal estate that can be divided for a fiduciary purpose, as being distinct from a person&#x27;s general assets. It is similar in some respects to the way under common law property is held, managed, or invested in trust by a trustee for the benefit of third parties (beneficiaries). The affected property remains outside the grantor&#x27;s assets; therefore, even if the grantor goes bankrupt, becomes insolvent, or incurs liabilities, the property remains untouchable and may continue to benefit the intended beneficiaries.

Originally proposed as a way of explaining the common law trust, the concept was first put forward by the French jurist Pierre Lepaulle who based it on the German &quot;Zweckvermögen&quot;.

<doc id="216046" wikidata="Q1133567" url="?curid=216046" title="Win32s">
<text>Win32s is a 32-bit application runtime environment for the Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 3.11 operating systems. It allowed some 32-bit applications to run on the 16-bit operating system using call thunks. A beta version of Win32s was available in October 1992. Version 1.10 was released in July 1993 simultaneously with Windows NT 3.1.

== Concept and characteristics ==

Win32s was intended as a partial implementation of the Win32 Windows API as it existed in early versions of Windows NT.

The &quot;s&quot; in Win32s signifies &quot;subset&quot;, as Win32s lacked a number of Windows NT functions, including multi-threading, asynchronous I/O, newer serial port functions and many GDI extensions. This generally limited it to &quot;Win32s applications&quot; which were specifically designed for the Win32s platform, although some standard Win32 programs would work correctly, including Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;3D Pinball Space Cadet&quot; and some of Windows 95&#x27;s included applets. Early versions of Internet Explorer (up to Version 5) were also Win32s compatible, although these also existed in 16-bit format. Generally, for a 32-bit application to be compatible with Win32s, it had to not use more than 16MB of memory or any extended features such as DirectX.

Win32s inherits many of the limitations of the Win16 environment. True Win32 applications execute within a private virtual address space, whereas Windows 3.x used an address space shared among all running applications. An application running on Win32s has the shared address space and cooperative multitasking characteristics of Windows 3.1. Consequently, for a Win32 application to run on Win32s, it must contain relocation information.

A technique named thunking is fundamental to the implementation of Win32s as well as Chicago-kernel operating systems, which are Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me. However, allowing user-level thunking greatly complicates attempts to provide stable memory management or memory protection on a system-wide basis, as well as core or kernel security—this allows poorly written applications to undermine system stability on Win32s, as well as the Chicago-kernel systems. 32-bit versions of Windows NT transparently provide a virtual machine for running Win16 applications, although this feature was removed from 64-bit versions of Windows.

== Compatibility ==
Win32s-compatible applications could be built using Microsoft&#x27;s development tools, as well as at least Borland C++ 4.x and Symantec C++ (now Digital Mars C++). However, several program compilation options (such as EXE relocation information) and DLLs which were implicit in Windows NT 3.1 have to be included with the application in Win32s. Microsoft ceased support for Win32s in Visual C++ version 4.2 released in late 1996.

Win32s included an implementation of the card game FreeCell as an example application, a couple of years before the game became famous with its inclusion in Windows 95.

&quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot;, a DOS game, included a level editor that required Win32s to run. The editor used a Windows GUI for displaying the large maps because high-resolution graphic modes were already handled by Windows. The NCSA Mosaic web browser version 2 also required Win32s.

C# applications can be compiled by the CoreRT compiler into Win32 code that is accepted by the 1994 Visual C++ linker. This combination produces Win32 executables that can run on Windows 3.1 with Win32s.

== Sources and installation ==

Win32s can still be found using web search engines; PW1118.EXE is generally the installation file used.

<text>Leroy &quot;Lee&quot; Edward Hood (born October 10, 1938) is an American biologist who has served on the faculties at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of Washington. 
Hood has developed ground-breaking scientific instruments which made possible major advances in the biological sciences and the medical sciences. These include 
the first gas phase protein sequencer (1982), for determining the sequence of amino acids in a given protein; 
a DNA synthesizer (1983), to synthesize short sections of DNA; 
a peptide synthesizer (1984), to combine amino acids into longer peptides and short proteins; 
the first automated DNA sequencer (1986), to identify the order of nucleotides in DNA; 
ink-jet oligonucleotide technology for synthesizing DNA and 
nanostring technology for analyzing single molecules of DNA and RNA. 
The protein sequencer, DNA synthesizer, peptide synthesizer, and DNA sequencer were commercialized through Applied Biosystems, Inc. and the ink-jet technology was commercialized through Agilent Technologies. 
The automated DNA sequencer was an enabling technology for the Human Genome Project. The peptide synthesizer was used in the synthesis of the HIV protease by Stephen Kent and others, and the development of a protease inhibitor for AIDS treatment.

Hood established the first cross-disciplinary biology department, the Department of Molecular Biotechnology (MBT), at the University of Washington in 1992, and co-founded the Institute for Systems Biology in 2000. Hood is credited with introducing the term &quot;systems biology&quot;, and advocates for &quot;P4 medicine&quot;, medicine that is &quot;predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory.&quot; &quot;Scientific American&quot; counted him among the 10 most influential people in the field of biotechnology in 2015.

Hood was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2007 for the invention and commercialization of key instruments, notably the automated DNA sequencer, that have enabled the biotechnology revolution.

==Background==
Hood was born on October 10, 1938, in Missoula, Montana, to Thomas Edward Hood and Myrtle Evylan Wadsworth. and grew up in Shelby. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother had a degree in home economics. Hood was one of four children, including a sister and two brothers, including a brother with Down syndrome. One of his grandfathers was a rancher and ran a summer geology camp for university students, which Hood attended as a high school student. Hood excelled in math and science, being one of forty students nationally to win a Westinghouse Science Talent Search. In addition, Hood played several high school sports and debate, the latter of which he would credit for his success in science communication later in his career.

==Education==
Hood received his undergraduate education from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where his professors included notables such as Richard Feynman and Linus Pauling. Hood received an MD from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1964 and a PhD from Caltech in 1968, where he worked with William J. Dreyer on antibody diversity. Dreyer is credited with giving Hood two important pieces of advice: “If you want to practice biology, do it on the leading edge, and if you want to be on the leading edge, invent new tools for deciphering biological information.”

==Career==
In 1967, Hood joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to work in the immunology branch of the National Cancer Institute as a senior investigator.

In 1970, he returned to Caltech as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1973, full professor in 1975, and was named Bowles Professor of Biology in 1977. 
He served as chairman of the Division of Biology from 1980-1989 and director of Caltech&#x27;s Special Cancer Center in 1981.

Hood has been a leader and a proponent of cross-disciplinary research in chemistry and biology. 
In 1989 he stepped down as chairman of the Division of Biology to create and become director of a newly funded NSF Science and Technology Center at Caltech. 
The NSF Center for the Development of an Integrated Protein and Nucleic Acid Biotechnology became one of the founding research centers of the Beckman Institute at Caltech in 1989. By this time, Hood&#x27;s laboratory included more than 100 researchers, a much larger group than was usual at Caltech. A relatively small school, Caltech was not well-suited to the creation of the type of large interdisciplinary research organization that Hood sought.

In October 1991, Hood announced that he would move to the University of Washington at Seattle, to found and direct the first cross-disciplinary biology department, the Department of Molecular Biotechnology (MBT) at the University of Washington Medical School. The new department was financed by a US $12-million gift from Bill Gates, who shared Hood&#x27;s interest in combining biological research and computer technology and applying them to medical research. Roger Perlmutter, who had worked in Hood&#x27;s lab at Caltech before moving to UW as chair of the immunology department, played a key role organizing his recruitment to UW. Hood and other scientists from Caltech&#x27;s NSF center moved to the University of Washington during 1992-1994, where they received renewed support from the NSF as the Center for Molecular Biotechnology. (Later, in 2001, the department of molecular biotechnology and the genetics department at UW reorganized to form the department of genome sciences.)

In 2000 Hood resigned his position at the University of Washington to become co-founder and president of the non-profit Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), possibly the first independent systems biology organization. His co-founders were protein chemist Ruedi Aebersold and immunologist Alan Aderem. Hood is still an affiliate professor at the University of Washington in Computer Science, Bioengineering and Immunology. In April 2017, the ISB announced that Hood will be succeeded as president of ISB as of January 2018 by James Heath, while continuing to lead his research group at ISB and serving on ISB&#x27;s board of directors.

Hood believes that a combination of big data and systems biology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and create a proactive medical approach focused on maximizing the wellness of the individual. He coined the term &quot;P4 medicine&quot; in 2003. 
In 2010 ISB partnered with the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio, to establish the nonprofit P4 Medicine Institute (P4MI). Its goal was stated as being &quot;to lead the transformation of healthcare from a reactive system to one that predicts and prevents disease, tailors diagnosis and therapy to the individual consumer and engages patients in the active pursuit of a quantified understanding of wellness; i.e. one that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory (P4).&quot; 
In 2012, P4 Medical Institute established an agreement with its first community health partner, PeaceHealth. PeaceHealth is a not-for-profit Catholic health care system, operating in a variety of communities in Alaska, Washington and Oregon. In 2016, ISB affiliated with Providence Health &amp; Services, and Hood became the senior vice president of Providence St. Joseph Health and its chief science officer.

Hood has published more than 700 peer-reviewed papers, received 36 patents, and co-authored textbooks in biochemistry, immunology, molecular biology, and genetics. In addition, he co-authored, with Daniel J. Kevles, &quot;The Code of Codes&quot;, a popular book on the sequencing of the human genome.

He has been instrumental in founding 15 biotechnology companies, including Amgen, Applied Biosystems, Systemix, Darwin, Rosetta Inpharmatics, Integrated Diagnostics, and Accelerator Corporation. In 2015, he co-founded a startup called Arivale offering a subscription-based &#x27;scientific wellness&#x27; service which shut down in 2019. While praising the quality of its offering, industry commentators attributed Arivale&#x27;s closure to a failure to capture sufficient Customer lifetime value to create a profit from providing the service, suggesting that insufficient numbers of customers stuck with the data-driven, personalized dietary and lifestyle coaching it provided for long enough at a price point which would make the business model work.

==Research==
===Genomics and proteomics===
At Caltech, Hood and his colleagues created the technological foundation for the study of genomics and proteomics by developing five groundbreaking instruments - the protein sequencer (1982), 
the DNA synthesizer (1983), 
the peptide synthesizer (1984),
the automated DNA sequencer (1986) and later 
the ink-jet DNA synthesizer. Hood&#x27;s instruments incorporated concepts of high throughput data accumulation through automation and parallelization. When applied to the study of protein and DNA chemistries, these ideas were essential to the rapid deciphering of biological information.

Hood had a strong interest in commercial development, actively filing patents and seeking private funding. 
Applied Biosystems, Inc. (initially named GeneCo.) was formed in 1981 in Foster City, California, to commercialize instruments developed by Hood, Hunkapiller, Caruthers, and others. The company was supported by venture capitalist William K. Bowes, who hired Sam H. Eletr and André Marion as president and vice-president of the new company. The company shipped the first gas phase protein sequencer, Model 4790A, in August 1982. The 380 DNA synthesizer was commercialized in 1983, the 430A peptide synthesizer in 1984, and the 370A DNA sequencing system in 1986.

These new instruments had a major impact on the emerging fields of proteomics and genomics. 
The gas-liquid phase protein sequencer was developed with Michael W. Hunkapiller, then a 
research fellow at Caltech. The instrument makes use of the chemical process known as the Edman degradation, devised by Pehr Edman. Edman and Begg&#x27;s 1967 design involves placing a protein or peptide sample into a spinning cup in a temperature controlled chamber. Reagents are added to cleave the protein one amino acid at the time, followed by solvents to allow extraction of reagents and byproducts. A series of analysis cycles is performed to identify a sequence, one cycle for each amino acid, and the cycle times were lengthy. Hood and Hunkapiller made a number of modifications, further automating steps in the analysis and improving effectiveness and shortening cycle time. By applying reagents in the gas phase instead of the liquid phase, the retention of the sample during the analysis and the sensitivity of the instrument were increased. 
Polybrene was used as a substrate coating to better anchor proteins and peptides, 
and the purification of reagents was improved. HPLC analysis techniques were used to reduce analysis times and extend the technique&#x27;s applicable range. 
The amount of protein required for an analysis decreased, from 10-100 nanomoles for Edman and Begg&#x27;s protein sequencer, to the low picomole range, a revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of the technology. 
The new sequencer offered significant advantages in speed and sample size compared to commercial sequencers of the time, the most popular of which were built by Beckman Instruments. 
Commercialized as the Model 470A protein sequencer, it allowed scientists to determine partial amino acid sequences of proteins that had not previously been accessible, characterizing new proteins and better understanding their activity, function, and effects in therapeutics. These discoveries had significant ramifications in biology, medicine, and pharmacology.
The first automated DNA synthesizer resulted from a collaboration with Marvin H. Caruthers of the University of Colorado Boulder, and was based on Caruthers&#x27; work elucidating the chemistry of phosphoramidite oligonucleotide synthesis. 
Caltech staff scientist Suzanna J. Horvath worked with Hood and Hunkapiller to learn Caruthers&#x27; techniques in order to design a prototype that automated the repetitive steps involved in Caruthers&#x27; method for DNA synthesis. 
The resulting prototype was capable of forming short pieces of DNA called oligonucleotides, which could be used in DNA mapping and gene identification. 
The first commercial phosphoramidite DNA synthesizer was developed from this prototype by Applied Biosystems, 
who installed the first Model 380A in Caruthers&#x27; lab at the University of Colorado in December 1982, before beginning official commercial shipment of the new instrument. 
Revolutionizing the field of molecular biology, the DNA synthesizer enabled biologists to synthesize DNA fragments for cloning and other genetic manipulations. Molecular biologists were able to produce DNA probes and primers for use in DNA sequencing and mapping, gene cloning, and gene synthesis. The DNA synthesizer played a critical role in the identification of many important genes and in the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the critical technique used to amplify segments of DNA a million-fold.

The first commercial automated peptide synthesizer, sometimes referred to as a protein synthesizer, was developed by Hood and Stephen B. H. Kent, a senior research associate at Caltech from 1983 to 1989. The automated, programmable peptide synthesizer had previously been invented and developed by Bruce Merrifield and colleagues at Rockefeller University, and Merrifield received the Novel Prize for this invention The peptide synthesizer assembles long peptides and short proteins from amino acid subunits, in quantities sufficient for subsequent analysis of their structure and function. The commercially available instrument from Applied Biosystems led to a number of significant results, including the synthesis of HIV-1 protease in a collaboration between Kent and Merck and the analysis of its crystalline structure. Based on this research, Merck developed an important antiprotease drug for the treatment of AIDS. Kent carried out a number of important synthesis and structure-function studies in Hood&#x27;s lab at Caltech.

Among the notable of the inventions from Hood&#x27;s lab was the automated DNA sequencer. It made possible high-speed sequencing of the structure of DNA, including the human genome. It automated many of the tasks that researchers had previously done by hand. Researchers Jane Z. Sanders and Lloyd M. Smith developed a way to color code the basic nucleotide units of DNA with fluorescent tags, green for adenine (A), yellow-green for guanine (G), orange for cytosine (C) and red for thymine (T). Four differently colored fluorophores, each one specific to a reaction with one of the bases, are covalently attached to the oligonucleotide primer for the enzymatic DNA sequence analysis. During the analysis, fragments are passed downwards through a gel tube, the smallest and lightest fragments passing through the gel tube first. A laser light passed through a filter wheel causes the bases to fluoresce. The resulting fluorescent colors are detected by a photomultiplier and recorded by a computer. The first DNA fragment to be sequenced was a common cloning vector, M13.

The DNA sequencer was a critical technology for the Human Genome Project. 
Hood was involved with the Human Genome Project from its first meeting, held at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1985. Hood became an enthusiastic advocate for The Human Genome Project and its potential. Hood directed the Human Genome Center’s sequencing of portions of human chromosomes 14 and 15.

At the University of Washington in the 1990s, Hood, Alan Blanchard, and others developed ink-jet DNA synthesis technology for creating DNA microarrays. By 2004, their ink-jet DNA synthesizer supported high-throughput identification and quantification of nucleic acids through the creation of one of the first DNA array chips, with expression levels numbering tens of thousands of genes. 
Array analysis has become a standard technique for molecular biologists who wish to monitor gene expression. 
DNA ink-jet printer technology has had a significant impact on genomics, biology, and medicine.

===Immunology and neurobiology===

Hood also made generative discoveries in the field of molecular immunology. His studies of the amino acid sequences of immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) helped to fuel the 1970s’ debate regarding the generation of immune diversity and supported the hypothesis advanced by William J. Dreyer that immunoglobulin (antibody) chains are encoded by two separate genes (a constant and a variable gene). He (and others) conducted pioneering studies on the structure and diversity of the antibody genes. This research led to verification of the &quot;two genes, one polypeptide&quot; hypothesis and insights into the mechanisms responsible for the diversification of the immunoglobulin variable genes. 
Hood shared the Lasker Award in 1987 for these studies.

Additionally, Hood was among the first to study, at the gene level, the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) gene family and the T-cell receptor gene families as well as being among first to demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing was a fundamental mechanism for generating alternative forms of antibodies. He showed that RNA splicing is the mechanism for generating the membrane bound and the secreted forms of antibodies.

In neurobiology, Hood and his colleagues were the first to clone and study the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. The MBP is a central component in the sheath that wraps and protects neurons. Hood demonstrated that the condition called &quot;shiverer mouse&quot; arose from a defect in the MBP gene. Hood&#x27;s research group corrected the neurological defect in mice (the shiverer defect) by transferring a normal MBP gene into the fertilized egg of the shiverer mouse. These discoveries led to extensive studies of MBP and its biology.

===Systems biology and systems medicine===

Beginning in the 1990s, Hood focused more on cross-disciplinary biology and systems biology. He established in 1992 the first cross-disciplinary biology department, the Molecular Biotechnology Department at the University of Washington. 
In 2000, he co-founded the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) in Seattle, Washington to develop strategies and technologies for systems approaches to biology and medicine.

Hood pioneered the systems biology concept of considering human biology as a &quot;network of networks.&quot; In this model, understanding how systems function requires knowledge of: (1) the components of each network (including genetic, molecular, cellular, organ networks), (2) how these networks inter- and intra-connect, (3) how the networks change over time and undergo perturbations, and (4) how function is achieved within these networks. At the ISB under Hood&#x27;s direction, genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic technologies are used to understand the &quot;network of networks&quot; and are focused on diverse biological systems 
(e.g. yeast, mice and humans).

Hood applies the notion of systems biology to the study of medicine, specifically to cancer and neurodegenerative disease. His research article on a systems approach to prion diseases in 2009 was one of the first to thoroughly explore the use of systems biology to interrogate the dynamic network changes in disease models. These studies are the first to explain the dynamics of diseased-perturbed networks and have expanded to include frontal temporal dementia and Huntington&#x27;s disease. 
Hood is also studying glioblastoma in mice and humans from the systems viewpoint.

Hood advocates several practices in the burgeoning field of systems medicine, including: 
(1) The use of family genome sequencing, integrating genetics and genomics, to identify genetic variants associated with health and disease
(2) The use of targeted proteomics and biomarkers as a window into health and disease. He has pioneered the discovery of biomarker panels for lung cancer and posttraumatic stress syndrome. 
(3) The use of systems biology to stratify disease into its different subtypes allowing for more effective treatment. 
(4) The use of systems strategies to identify new types of drug targets to facilitate and accelerate the drug discovery process.

=== P4 medicine ===
Since 2002 Hood has progressively expanded his vision of the future of medicine: first focusing on predictive and preventive (2P) Medicine; then predictive, preventive and personalized (3P) Medicine; and finally predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory, also known as P4 Medicine. Hood states that P4 Medicine is the convergence of systems medicine, big data and patient (consumer) driven healthcare and social networks.

Hood envisions that by the mid-2020s each individual will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data points and will have the computational tools to analyze this data and produce simple approaches to optimize wellness and minimize disease for each individual. According to this view, the patient&#x27;s demand for better healthcare will be the real driving force for the acceptance of P4 Medicine by the medical community. This driving force is exemplified by the movement known as the quantified self, which uses digital devices to monitor self-parameters such as weight, activity, sleep, diet, etc. His view is that P4 Medicine will transform the practice of medicine over the next decade, moving it from a largely reactive, disease-care approach to a proactive P4 approach that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory.

In 2010, Hood co-founded the P4 Medicine institute (P4Mi), for the development of Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory (P4) Medicine. In 2021 Hood founded Phenome Health, a non profit focused on implementing his vision. He argues that P4 Medicine will improve healthcare, decrease its cost and promote innovation.

<text>Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique of precisely deforming a mirror in order to compensate for light distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy, optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.

Adaptive optics should not be confused with active optics, which work on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry.

Other methods can achieve resolving power exceeding the limit imposed by atmospheric distortion, such as speckle imaging, aperture synthesis, and lucky imaging, or by moving outside the atmosphere with space telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.

== History ==

Adaptive optics was first envisioned by Horace W. Babcock in 1953, and was also considered in science fiction, as in Poul Anderson&#x27;s novel&quot; Tau Zero&quot; (1970), but it did not come into common usage until advances in computer technology during the 1990s made the technique practical.

Some of the initial development work on adaptive optics was done by the US military during the Cold War and was intended for use in tracking Soviet satellites.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors and magnetics concept deformable mirrors are currently the most widely used technology in wavefront shaping applications for adaptive optics given their versatility, stroke, maturity of technology, and the high-resolution wavefront correction that they afford.

== Tip–tilt correction ==
The simplest form of adaptive optics is &quot;tip–tilt correction&quot;, which corresponds to correction of the tilts of the wavefront in two dimensions (equivalent to correction of the position offsets for the image). This is performed using a rapidly moving tip–tilt mirror that makes small rotations around two of its axes. A significant fraction of the aberration introduced by the atmosphere can be removed in this way.

Tip–tilt mirrors are effectively segmented mirrors having only one segment which can tip and tilt, rather than having an array of multiple segments that can tip and tilt independently. Due to the relative simplicity of such mirrors and having a large stroke, meaning they have large correcting power, most AO systems use these, first, to correct low-order aberrations. Higher-order aberrations may then be corrected with deformable mirrors.

== In astronomy ==
=== Atmospheric seeing ===
When light from a star or another astronomical object enters the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, atmospheric turbulence (introduced, for example, by different temperature layers and different wind speeds interacting) can distort and move the image in various ways. Visual images produced by any telescope larger than approximately are blurred by these distortions.

=== Wavefront sensing and correction ===
An adaptive optics system tries to correct these distortions, using a wavefront sensor which takes some of the astronomical light, a deformable mirror that lies in the optical path, and a computer that receives input from the detector. The wavefront sensor measures the distortions the atmosphere has introduced on the timescale of a few milliseconds; the computer calculates the optimal mirror shape to correct the distortions and the surface of the deformable mirror is reshaped accordingly. For example, an telescope (like the VLT or Keck) can produce AO-corrected images with an angular resolution of 30–60 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution at infrared wavelengths, while the resolution without correction is of the order of 1 arcsecond.}

In order to perform adaptive optics correction, the shape of the incoming wavefronts must be measured as a function of position in the telescope aperture plane. Typically the circular telescope aperture is split up into an array of pixels in a wavefront sensor, either using an array of small lenslets (a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor), or using a curvature or pyramid sensor which operates on images of the telescope aperture. The mean wavefront perturbation in each pixel is calculated. This pixelated map of the wavefronts is fed into the deformable mirror and used to correct the wavefront errors introduced by the atmosphere. It is not necessary for the shape or size of the astronomical object to be known – even Solar System objects which are not point-like can be used in a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, and time-varying structure on the surface of the Sun is commonly used for adaptive optics at solar telescopes. The deformable mirror corrects incoming light so that the images appear sharp.

=== Using guide stars ===

==== Natural guide stars ====
Because a science target is often too faint to be used as a reference star for measuring the shape of the optical wavefronts, a nearby brighter guide star can be used instead. The light from the science target has passed through approximately the same atmospheric turbulence as the reference star&#x27;s light and so its image is also corrected, although generally to a lower accuracy.

The necessity of a reference star means that an adaptive optics system cannot work everywhere on the sky, but only where a guide star of sufficient luminosity (for current systems, about magnitude 12–15) can be found very near to the object of the observation. This severely limits the application of the technique for astronomical observations. Another major limitation is the small field of view over which the adaptive optics correction is good. As the angular distance from the guide star increases, the image quality degrades. A technique known as &quot;multiconjugate adaptive optics&quot; uses several deformable mirrors to achieve a greater field of view.

==== Artificial guide stars ====

An alternative is the use of a laser beam to generate a reference light source (a laser guide star, LGS) in the atmosphere. There are two kinds of LGSs: Rayleigh guide stars and sodium guide stars. Rayleigh guide stars work by propagating a laser, usually at near ultraviolet wavelengths, and detecting the backscatter from air at altitudes between . Sodium guide stars use laser light at 589 nm to resonantly excite sodium atoms higher in the mesosphere and thermosphere, which then appear to &quot;glow&quot;. The LGS can then be used as a wavefront reference in the same way as a natural guide star – except that (much fainter) natural reference stars are still required for image position (tip/tilt) information. The lasers are often pulsed, with measurement of the atmosphere being limited to a window occurring a few microseconds after the pulse has been launched. This allows the system to ignore most scattered light at ground level; only light which has travelled for several microseconds high up into the atmosphere and back is actually detected.}

== In retinal imaging ==

Ocular aberrations are distortions in the wavefront passing through the pupil of the eye. These optical aberrations diminish the quality of the image formed on the retina, sometimes necessitating the wearing of spectacles or contact lenses. In the case of retinal imaging, light passing out of the eye carries similar wavefront distortions, leading to an inability to resolve the microscopic structure (cells and capillaries) of the retina. Spectacles and contact lenses correct &quot;low-order aberrations&quot;, such as defocus and astigmatism, which tend to be stable in humans for long periods of time (months or years). While correction of these is sufficient for normal visual functioning, it is generally insufficient to achieve microscopic resolution. Additionally, &quot;high-order aberrations&quot;, such as coma, spherical aberration, and trefoil, must also be corrected in order to achieve microscopic resolution. High-order aberrations, unlike low-order, are not stable over time, and may change over time scales of 0.1s to 0.01s. The correction of these aberrations requires continuous, high-frequency measurement and compensation.

=== Measurement of ocular aberrations ===
Ocular aberrations are generally measured using a wavefront sensor, and the most commonly used type of wavefront sensor is the Shack–Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the wavefront exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, these are measured by placing a two-dimensional array of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye&#x27;s pupil, and a CCD chip at the back focal plane of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots to be focused onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront allowing one to numerically reconstruct the wavefront information—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.

=== Correction of ocular aberrations ===
Once the local phase errors in the wavefront are known, they can be corrected by placing a phase modulator such as a deformable mirror at yet another plane in the system conjugate to the eye&#x27;s pupil. The phase errors can be used to reconstruct the wavefront, which can then be used to control the deformable mirror. Alternatively, the local phase errors can be used directly to calculate the deformable mirror instructions.

=== Open loop vs. closed loop operation ===
If the wavefront error is measured before it has been corrected by the wavefront corrector, then operation is said to be &quot;open loop&quot;.

If the wavefront error is measured after it has been corrected by the wavefront corrector, then operation is said to be &quot;closed loop&quot;. In the latter case then the wavefront errors measured will be small, and errors in the measurement and correction are more likely to be removed. Closed loop correction is the norm.

=== Applications ===
Adaptive optics was first applied to flood-illumination retinal imaging to produce images of single cones in the living human eye. It has also been used in conjunction with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to produce (also in living human eyes) the first images of retinal microvasculature and associated blood flow and retinal pigment epithelium cells in addition to single cones. Combined with optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics has allowed the first three-dimensional images of living cone photoreceptors to be collected.

== In microscopy ==

In microscopy, adaptive optics is used to correct for sample-induced aberrations. The required wavefront correction is either measured directly using wavefront sensor or estimated by using sensorless AO techniques.

== Other uses ==
Besides its use for improving nighttime astronomical imaging and retinal imaging, adaptive optics technology has also been used in other settings. Adaptive optics is used for solar astronomy at observatories such as the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, Dunn Solar Telescope, and Big Bear Solar Observatory. It is also expected to play a military role by allowing ground-based and airborne laser weapons to reach and destroy targets at a distance including satellites in orbit. The Missile Defense Agency Airborne Laser program is the principal example of this.

Adaptive optics has been used to enhance the performance of classical 
and quantum free-space optical communication systems, and to control the spatial output of optical fibers.

Medical applications include imaging of the retina, where it has been combined with optical coherence tomography. Also the development of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) has enabled correcting for the aberrations of the wavefront that is reflected from the human retina and to take diffraction limited images of the human rods and cones. Adaptive and active optics are also being developed for use in glasses to achieve better than 20/20 vision, initially for military applications.

After propagation of a wavefront, parts of it may overlap leading to interference and preventing adaptive optics from correcting it. Propagation of a curved wavefront always leads to amplitude variation. This needs to be considered if a good beam profile is to be achieved in laser applications. In material processing using lasers, adjustments can be made on the fly to allow for variation of focus-depth during piercing for changes in focal length across the working surface. Beam width can also be adjusted to switch between piercing and cutting mode. This eliminates the need for optic of the laser head to be switched, cutting down on overall processing time for more dynamic modifications.

Adaptive optics, especially wavefront-coding spatial light modulators, are frequently used in optical trapping applications to multiplex and dynamically reconfigure laser foci that are used to micro-manipulate biological specimens.

== Beam stabilization ==
A rather simple example is the stabilization of the position and direction of laser beam between modules in a large free space optical communication system. Fourier optics is used to control both direction and position. The actual beam is measured by photo diodes. This signal is fed into analog-to-digital converters and then a microcontroller which runs a PID controller algorithm. The controller then drives digital-to-analog converters which drive stepper motors attached to mirror mounts.

If the beam is to be centered onto 4-quadrant diodes, no analog-to-digital converter is needed. Operational amplifiers are sufficient.

<text>Traditional climbing (or trad climbing) is a type of free climbing in rock climbing where the lead climber places their protection while simultaneously ascending the route; when the lead climber has completed the route, the second climber (or belayer) then removes this protection as they ascend the route. Traditional climbing differs from sport climbing where the protection equipment is already pre-drilled into the rock in the form of bolts. Traditional climbing is still the dominant format on longer multi-pitch routes, including alpine and big wall.

Traditional climbing carries a much higher level of risk than bolted sport climbing as the climber may not have placed the protection equipment correctly while ascending the route, or there may be few opportunities to insert satisfactory protection (e.g. on very difficult routes). Traditional climbing was once the dominant form of free climbing but since the mid-1980s, sport climbing — and its related form of competition climbing — became more popular for single pitch, and all grade milestones from onwards were on single-pitch sport routes.

From the early 2000s, there was a resurgence in interest in single-pitch traditional climbing as climbers began greenpointing sport routes (e.g. &quot;Greenspit&quot; and &quot;The Path&quot;), and setting new milestones for traditional routes (e.g. &quot;Cobra Crack&quot; at by Sonnie Trotter, and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; at by Dave MacLeod). Female climber Beth Rodden created a new traditional route at the same level as the men with &quot;Meltdown&quot; also at . In 2019, Jacopo Larcher created what is considered the first graded traditional route with &quot;Tribe&quot;.

==Description==

Traditional climbing (or &quot;Trad&quot; climbing), is a form of free climbing (i.e. no artificial or mechanical device can be used to aid progression, unlike with aid climbing), which is performed in pairs where the lead climber places climbing protection into the climbing route while ascending. After the lead climber has reached the top, the second climber (or belayer) removes this temporary climbing protection while climbing the route. Some consider the hammering in of pitons while climbing the route, as long as they are only for climbing protection and not to aid progression, to also be traditional climbing.

Traditional climbing differs from sport climbing that has the climbing protection already pre-bolted into the route (i.e. the lead climber just clips their rope into quickdraws attached to the bolts); sport climbing is therefore a much safer, and less stressful, form of free climbing. Traditional climbing differs from free solo climbing where no climbing protection is used whatsoever.

===First free ascent===

With the greater popularity of sport climbing, traditional climbing evolved to embrace some of its redpointing techniques in making a first free ascent (FFA). The previously controversial practices of hangdogging (i.e. practicing on an abseil rope), and headpointing (i.e. practicing on a top rope) are now accepted by the leading traditional climbers. Traditional climbers subsequently introduced the derived term &#x27;greenpointing&#x27; (or the &quot;Grünpunkt&quot; movement, as a play on the sport climbing &quot;Rotpunkt&quot; movement), to describe making the first free ascent of a pre-bolted sport-climb, but only using &quot;traditional protection&quot;.

==History==

As 20th-century rock climbers began to free climb (i.e. avoiding any form of aid), they often used traditional climbing techniques for protection. Early traditional climbers relied on crude, and often unreliable, forms of homemade &quot;passive&quot; climbing protection such as pieces of metal or chockstones attached to slings.

With the development of &quot;active&quot; traditional climbing protection in the 1970s—called spring-loaded camming devices (SLCDs, or &quot;friends&quot;)—the grades of technical difficulty that traditional climbers could safely undertake on crack climbing routes increased dramatically, and new grade milestones were set on new traditional climbing routes. However, by the mid-1980s, the leading traditional climbers were again facing technical challenges with minimal possibilities for traditional climbing protection (i.e. face climbing routes with tiny or no cracks whatsoever in which to insert SLCDs), that required them to accept significant personal risks – Johnny Dawes&#x27;s 1986 ascent of &quot;Indian Face&quot; being a notable example.

At this time, French climbers such as Patrick Edlinger began to pre-drill permanent masonry bolts into the almost &quot;blank&quot; faces of Buoux and Verdon for protection (but not as artificial aid); this became known as sport climbing. It led to a dramatic increase in climbing standards – all future new grade milestones would be set on sport climbing routes. The increased safety of pre-drilled bolts also led to the development and popularity of competition climbing and the emergence of the &quot;professional&quot; rock climber. Sport climbing then became—and remains today—the most popular form of single-pitch rock climbing, although traditional climbing is still popular in multi-pitch climbing and in big wall and alpine climbing in particular.

Traditional returned to single-pitch prominence when in 2003, Swiss climber Didier Berthod greenpointed the bolted sport climb &quot;Greenspit&quot; (E9, 5.14, 8b) to create one of the hardest traditional crack routes in the world. In 2006, Canadian climber Sonnie Trotter greenpointed &quot;The Path&quot; (E9, 5.14a R, 8b+) to create one of the world&#x27;s hardest traditional climbs at the time. Trotter, and other leading &#x27;trad&#x27; climbers such as Dave MacLeod, led a resurgence in traditional climbing by creating new grade milestones on routes such as &quot;Cobra Crack&quot; (E10, 5.14b, 8c) and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (E11, 5.14c R/X, 8c+). The increased prominence of traditional climbing attracted the leading sport climbers who began to repeat—and create—major traditional routes (e.g. Ethan Pringle with &quot;BlackBeard&#x27;s Tears&quot; and Beth Rodden with &quot;Meltdown&quot;). In 2023, when British climber James Pearson created one of the world&#x27;s first E12 &#x27;trad&#x27; routes with &quot;Bon Voyage&quot;, the first repeat was by sport climbing legend, Adam Ondra.

== Protection ==
===Equipment===
Traditional climbing requires more rock climbing equipment than sport climbing as the lead climber needs to carry, and insert, protection devices while climbing the route. The choice of equipment carried will depend on the type of route being attempted. Some of the most difficult and dangerous traditional routes (e.g. &quot;Indian Face&quot; or &quot;Master&#x27;s Edge&quot;) offer very little opportunity to insert protection into the rock, and thus the lead climber carries very little protective equipment.

Classic traditional climbs often involve crack climbing (e.g. &quot;Separate Reality&quot;) that offers greater opportunity for inserting protection – into the crack itself – and the lead climber will carry a lot more equipment to secure their safety.

Two main classes of protection are used in traditional climbing, namely: &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;active&quot;. Passive protection devices include nuts, hexcentrics and tricams, and are metal shapes attached to wires or slings, which can be inserted into cracks and fissures in the rock that will act like temporary sport climbing bolts (to which quickdraws and the rope can be clipped into). Active protection consists of spring-loaded camming devices (or &quot;friends&quot;), which are cams that dynamically adjust to the size of the crack or fissure in the rock, but also act like temporary sport climbing bolts.

===Risk===

The traditional climber has two key concerns, or areas of risk, when placing the protection equipment while leading the traditional route.

The first concern is related to the quality of the protection placements. Where these placements are considered good and will hold the climber in the event of a major fall, they are called &quot;bomb-proof&quot; (i.e. they behave just like pre-drilled bolts). However, when the placements are poor, and there is uncertainty that they will hold in the event of a major fall – risking a &quot;zipper-fall&quot; – they are described as &quot;thin&quot;. For example, when Johnny Dawes freed the traditional climb &quot;Indian Face&quot; (E9 6c) in 1986, the protection was so thin, Dawes assumed if he fell, the protection would rip out, and he would fall to the ground.

The other concern is the distance between the protection placements. Where there are many protection placements with small gaps between them (e.g. 2 to 3 metres), then any fall will be short and less onerous; even if one placement fails/rips-out, there are more placements that might still hold. However, large gaps between placements – known as a &quot;run out&quot; – means that any fall will be larger and will place more pressure on the existing placements to hold the fall. Famous extreme traditional climbs such as &quot;Master&#x27;s Edge&quot; (E7 6c) and &quot;Gaia&quot; (E8 6c) have notorious run-outs, where even if the protection holds, the falling climber has a high chance of hitting the ground, as spectacularly shown in the opening sequence of the 1998 British climbing film, &quot;Hard Grit&quot;.

To reflect the greater risk of traditional climbing routes over sport climbing routes, an additional grade is often added to the route&#x27;s grade of technical difficulty (i.e. how hard are the individual moves) to reflect the risks. In the United Kingdom, this is known as the &quot;adjectival&quot; grade (Diff, VDiff, HS, VS, HVS, E1 to E11). In the United States, it takes the form of a suffix (PG – be careful, R – fall will cause injury, R/X – fall will cause serious injury, X – fall likely to be fatal).

==Grading==

The grading of traditional climbing routes starts with a sport climbing grade for the &quot;technical difficulty&quot;, and an additional &quot;risk grade&quot; to reflect how hard the lead climber will find protecting the route while ascending. Some sport grading systems, particularly the French system (e.g. ... 6b, 6c, 7a, 7b, 7c, ...), offer no additional &quot;risk grade&quot;, and are thus less likely to be used as traditional climbing grades (but may be quoted alongside one). The most dominant grading system for traditional climbing is the American system (e.g. ... 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d, 5.11a, ...), which for traditional routes can add the &quot;suffix&quot; of &quot;R&quot; for risk of serious injury in any fall, or &quot;X&quot; for routes where a fall at a particular place, could be fatal (i.e. a &quot;chop route&quot;). For example, a famous but serious extreme North American traditional climb is Sonnie Trotter&#x27;s 2007 route, &quot;The Path&quot; in Lake Louise, Alberta, which is graded 5.14a R.

One of the most detailed, and still widely used, traditional grading systems is the British E-grade (e.g. ... VS 4c, HVS 5a, E1 5b, E2 5c, E4 6a, ...). Two grades are quoted; the first being the &quot;adjectival grade&quot;, and the second being the &quot;technical grade&quot;. The interplay between the two grades reflects the &quot;risk grade&quot; of the route. For each &quot;technical grade&quot;, there is a &quot;normal&quot; equivalent &quot;adjectival grade&quot;; for example, for the technical grade of &quot;6a&quot;, the &quot;normal&quot; &quot;adjectival grade&quot; is &quot;E4&quot;. Where the &quot;adjectival grade&quot; is lower than &quot;normal&quot;, for example, E3 6a (or even E2 6a), that means the route is much safer and easier to protect. When the &quot;adjectival grade&quot; is higher than &quot;normal&quot;, for example, E5 6a (or even E6 6a), that means the route is more dangerous and harder to protect. For example, one of the most famous and dangerous extreme British traditional climbs is Johnny Dawes&#x27; 1986 route, &quot;Indian Face&quot;, which is graded E9 6c (instead of the &quot;normal&quot; E7 6c), or 5.13a X under the American system.

Before the emergence of sport climbing in the early 1980s, almost all new grade milestones in rock climbing were set by traditional climbers. By the end of the 1970s, male traditional climbers were climbing to with &#x27;s &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;, while female traditional climbers were climbing to , with Lynn Hill on &quot;Ophir Broke&quot;. During the early 1980s, leading European traditional climbers like Jerry Moffatt and Wolfgang Güllich changed to sport climbing, in which all future new grade milestones would be established. Moffatt&#x27;s last major traditional FFA was &quot;Master&#x27;s Wall&quot; (E7 6b) in 1984, where he said afterward: &quot;At that time to be respected, you really had to be putting up really scary new [traditional] routes. That was where it was at, in Britain at least. Master&#x27;s Wall is probably where I risked most&quot;.

===Post sport-climbing era===

While the status of traditional climbing waned during the rise of the safer disciplines of sport climbing (and its related sport of competition climbing), and latterly bouldering, contemporary traditional climbers continued to set new &quot;traditional climbing&quot; grade milestones.

By 2024, the strongest male traditional climbers (e.g. Jacopo Larcher and James Pearson) were climbing just one notch above the strongest female traditional climbers (e.g. Beth Rodden, Hazel Findlay and Barbara Zangerl) at versus . In contrast, the strongest male sport climbers (e.g. Adam Ondra and Seb Bouin) were climbing two notches above the strongest female sport climbers (e.g. Angela Eiter and Laura Rogora) at versus 

As of 2024, the following traditional routes are considered to be some of the hardest-ever ascended:

*&quot;Bon Voyage&quot; (at least 5.14d, 9a, E12) in Annot, France, first free ascent (FFA) by James Pearson in 2023; repeated by Adam Ondra in 2024.

==In film==
A number of notable films have been made focused on traditional climbing including: 
*&quot;Hard Grit&quot;, a 1998 documentary film about traditional climbing on extreme gritstone routes in the British Peak District
*&quot;Valley Uprising&quot;, a 2014 Sender Films documentary film about rock climbing in Yosemite that includes traditional climbing

<doc id="216051" wikidata="Q5003495" url="?curid=216051" title="Buzz (DC Thomson)">
<text>Buzz was an A3 (broadsheet) British comic book magazine that ran from 20 January 1973 to 4 January 1975, when it merged with The &quot;Topper&quot;. Edited by Roy Patterson &quot;Buzz&quot; ran for 103 Issues.

Other staff that worked on the comic included Euan Kerr, who went on to edit The Beano for 20 years, and Garry Fraser, future editor of Classics from the Comics and the Fun Size Dandy. Notable artists included Ken H. Harrison and Gordon Bell.

==History==
First published in January 1973 Buzz was an A3 size comic similar in style to The Beezer and The Topper. At the time of its publication, the publisher DC Thomson, were publishing five other weekly humour comics the aforementioned Beezer and Topper as well as The Beano and The Dandy. Buzz lasted roughly two years ending in January 1975 when it merged with the Topper. Six of Buzz&#x27;s comic strips continued in The Topper: Fred the Flop, Big Fat Flo, Nobby, Jimmy Jinx and what he thinks, Sammy&#x27;s Scribbles and Sleepy Ed. Of these Fred the Flop and Jimmy Jinx were the longest running continuing in the Topper until 1986 and 1989 respectively.

After the merger the Topper continued as Topper and Buzz from the 11th January 1975 until November of that year when Buzz was removed from the title. 
As well as moving to the Topper one of Buzz&#x27;s comic strips, Skookum Skool, moved to the new comic Cracker which started the same month that Buzz ended. Cracker has been described &quot;more or less the same content-wise&quot; as Buzz although with a couple of differences.

Comic strips from Buzz were reprinted in Classics from the Comics, which ran from 1996 to 2010, with the Buzz name appearing on the front cover for most issues.

These are in alphabetical order and all numbers refer to issues of &quot;Buzz&quot;.

==Reception==
Buzz was described by comics historian Graham Kibble-White as unoriginal, pointing to similarities between it and other DC Thomson comics as well as Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

<doc id="216052" wikidata="Q7070587" url="?curid=216052" title="Nutty">
<text>Nutty was a British comic magazine that ran for 292 issues from 16 February 1980 to 14 September 1985, when it merged with &quot;The Dandy&quot;. Published by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, &quot;Nutty&quot; was an attempt to create a more lively and chaotic comic compared to many on sale at the time.

==Strips==
Nutty&#x27;s strips included:
* Bananaman was its main strip, and by far its most popular. Drawn by John Geering, it survived the merger with &quot;The Dandy&quot; and that comic&#x27;s eventual closure in the 2010s, moving to &quot;The Beano&quot;.
* Big &#x27;n Bud was a double-act style comic strip: they observed various scenarios, and then made jokes based upon what they observed. They appeared in the first edition.
* Blubba and the Bear, an Eskimo in conflict with a polar bear trying to steal his fish, who later appeared in the Dandy as reprints from number 3408 but ended when &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot; started.
* Cannonball Kid, &quot;He&#x27;s Football Crazy&quot;, similar to a &quot;Beano&quot; strip called Ball Boy, later reprinted as The Dandy&#x27;s Owen Goal.
* Cuddles, a naughty baby. The strip was drawn by Barrie Appleby and later moved to &quot;Hoot&quot; before joining Dimples in &quot;The Dandy&quot;.
* Dick Turban, Desert Highwayman, a boy desert raider who rode a camel.
* Doodlebug, a slightly surreal tale of a bug in a comic-book world who could draw and remove things with a magic pencil. The other inhabitants of this world were also bugs, with their names reflecting their personality. Humbug, for instance was of a miserable disposition. Bedbug was portrayed as a sleepy character, often seen in bed or at least in bedclothes. These characters often reappeared, but it wasn&#x27;t always the same character that had been seen previously. The strip was drawn by Gordon Bell
* Ethel Red, a Viking girl.
* General Jumbo, a new series of the former &quot;Beano&quot; character, drawn by Sandy Calder.
* Horace Cope, a boy of the same name who enlisted help from his grandmother, Madame Zsa Zsa, an astrologer.
* Jay R. Hood, &quot;He&#x27;s Anything But Good&quot;, a junior version of J. R. Ewing, drawn by George Martin.
* Micro Dot, a girl who consulted her BBC Micro for advice, drawn by Gordon Bell.
* Mitey Joe, about a small boy and his wish to be taller, drawn by John Geering.
* Nip and Rrip, a boy with a violent cat that bore a remarkable similarity to Gnasher, drawn by George Martin.
* Peter Pest, a boy who constantly interrupted his sister&#x27;s attempt to be alone with her boyfriends. The title survived &quot;Dandy&quot; merger.
* Pig Tales, a family of pigs, similar to a &quot;Beano&quot; strip &quot;The Three Bears&quot;.
* Ron Brown&#x27;s Schooldays, the adventures of a group of schoolchildren. The title was a play on &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;.
* Samuel Creeps, a school who outwitted bullies.
* Scoopy, &quot;The Runaround Hound With a Nose For News&quot;, a dog journalist, drawn by Gordon Bell.
* The Snobbs and the Slobbs, a rich-family-versus-poor-family strip. Drawn by John Geering, the strip survived &quot;Dandy&quot; merger.
* Snoozer, similar to Whizzer and Chips&#x27; Lazy Bones at the time, this strip concerned a boy who kept falling asleep. It was drawn by Gordon Bell.
* Stevie Starr, a young television star who was seen making, or starring in, a different show each week. It also appeared in &quot;The Topper&quot;.
* Whoops-A-Daisy, a mischievous girl, drawn by Barry Appleby.
* The Wild Rovers, a group of dogs who had comedy adventures.

<doc id="216053" wikidata="Q658444" url="?curid=216053" title="Kyoto Prize">
<text>The is Japan&#x27;s highest private award for lifetime achievement in the arts and sciences. It is given not only to those that are top representatives of their own respective fields, but to &quot;those who have contributed significantly to the scientific, cultural, and spiritual betterment of mankind&quot;. The Kyoto Prize was created in collaboration with the Nobel Foundation and is regarded by many as Japan&#x27;s version of the Nobel Prize, representing one of the most prestigious awards available in fields that are not traditionally honored with a Nobel.

The prizes are endowed with 100 million yen (roughly 700,000 USD) per category and have been awarded annually since 1985 by the Inamori Foundation, founded by Kazuo Inamori. The laureates are announced each June; the prize presentation ceremony and related events are held in Kyoto, Japan, each November.

==Categories and fields==
The Kyoto Prize consists of three different categories, each with 4 subfields. The subfields rotate every year to create a diverse group of Laureates. The categories and fields are:
:Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology
::With Fields: Electronics, Biotechnology and Medical Technology, Materials Science and Engineering, and Information Science.

:Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences
::With Fields: Mathematical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Earth and Planetary Sciences (Astronomy and Astrophysics), and Life Sciences (With the fifth subfield of Cognitive Sciences with one Laureate, Noam Chomsky in 1988).

:Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy
::With Fields: Music, Arts, Theater (Cinema), and Thought and Ethics

==Laureates==
With the 2015 Kyoto laureates, the three-category prizes have honored 99 individuals and one foundation (the Nobel Foundation). Individual laureates range from scientists, engineers, and researchers to philosophers, painters, architects, sculptors, musicians, and film directors. The United States has produced the most recipients (44), followed by Japan (19), the United Kingdom (12), France (8) and Hungary, Russia, India (3)

<doc id="216058" wikidata="Q562230" url="?curid=216058" title="USS Yorktown (CV-10)">
<text>USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-10) is one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. Initially to have been named &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, she was renamed &quot;Yorktown&quot; while still under construction, after the , which was sunk at the Battle of Midway. She is the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, though the previous ships were named for the 1781 Battle of Yorktown. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning 11 battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation.

Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in February 1953 as an attack carrier (CVA), and served with distinction during the Korean War. The ship was later modernized again with a canted deck, eventually becoming an anti-submarine carrier (CVS) and served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the Vietnam War, during which she earned five battle stars. The carrier served as a recovery ship for the December, 1968, Apollo 8 space mission, the first crewed ship to reach and orbit the Moon, and was used in the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, which recreated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and in the 1984 science fiction film &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot;.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a museum ship at Patriots Point, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, where she was designated a National Historic Landmark.

==Construction and commissioning==
Work was begun on &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; when her keel was laid down on 1 December 1941 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company, six days before the Attack on Pearl Harbor. She was renamed on 26 September 1942 as USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; to commemorate the loss of during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, and launched on 21 January 1943, sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was commissioned on 15 April 1943, with Captain Joseph J. Clark in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
&quot;Yorktown&quot; remained in the Naval Station Norfolk area until 21 May 1943, when she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of Trinidad. She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited Chesapeake Bay on her way to the Pacific Ocean. She transited the Panama Canal on 11 July and departed Balboa, Panama, on 12 July. The warship arrived in Pearl Harbor on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her task force, TF 15, arrived at the launching point about from Marcus Island early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.

On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the West Coast of the United States. She arrived in San Francisco on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor. &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on Japanese installations on Wake Island. After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii. &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived at Oahu on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.

====Marshall and Gilbert Islands====
On 10 November, &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in company with Task Force 38—the Fast Carrier Task Force, Pacific Fleet—to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of the Gilbert Islands. On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near Jaluit and Mili Atoll and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on Tarawa, Abemama, and Makin. The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at Wotje and Kwajalein Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.

On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault – Operation Flintlock, the Marshall Islands invasion. The Fast Carrier Task Force was then attached to Fifth Fleet and re-designated TF 58, with the &quot;Yorktown&quot; task group re-designated as Task Group 58.1 (TG 58.1). When TG 58.1 arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, carriers &quot;Yorktown&quot;, , and began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on Maloelap Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on Majuro and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January, &quot;Yorktown&quot; aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the &quot;Yorktown&quot; air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.

====Central Pacific raids====
Over the next four months, &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the Marianas in the north to New Guinea in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at Truk Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16–17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas, and on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on Saipan. That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30–31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the Palau Islands; and on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of Woleai. Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.

On 13 April, &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s assault on the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the Wakde-Sarmi area of northern New Guinea. On 22–23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May, and for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific. &quot;Yorktown&quot; entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operation—the assault on the Marianas.

====Marianas and Palau Islands====
On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan. &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on Guam. Those raids continued until 13 June, when &quot;Yorktown&quot;, with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the Bonin Islands. That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. TF 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.

On the morning of 19 June, &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large bogey appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s planes continued to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.

On the morning of 20 June, &quot;Yorktown&quot; steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units. &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after on which they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese. &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on Pagan Island on 22–23 June. On 24 June, she launched a series of raids on Iwo Jima. On 25 June, she laid in a course for Eniwetok and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3–4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima. On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on Yap, Ulithi, and the Palaus. She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.

On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headed—via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor—back to the United States. &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the Alameda Naval Air Station from 11 to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 to 24 October, &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.

====Philippines campaign====
On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the Philippines in support of the Leyte invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November, &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of Luzon in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous typhoon of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers – , , and – and &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December 1944, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in Formosa (now known as Taiwan) and the Philippines in support of the landings at Lingayen. The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the rest of TF 38 entered the South China Sea via Bashi Channel to begin a series of raids on Japan&#x27;s inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of Saigon and Tourane (now named Da Nang), Indochina, in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional score – 44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and Canton in China. The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again and also went to Hong Kong. On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via Balintang Channel. She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on Okinawa on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.

====Operations against Japan and Iwo Jima====

&quot;Yorktown&quot; remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the 3rd Fleet becoming the 5th Fleet when Raymond A. Spruance relieved William Halsey, Jr., on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the Tokyo area of Honshū. On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time &quot;Yorktown&quot; cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February, &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on Kyūshū before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. &quot;Yorktown&quot; re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.

She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kyūshū, Honshū, and Shikoku.

The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine bomber, probably a Yokosuka P1Y &quot;Frances&quot;, attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime, &quot;Yorktown&quot; continued air operations. That afternoon, three Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive-bombers launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship&#x27;s hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26. &quot;Yorktown&quot;, however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.

On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kyūshū. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single &quot;Judy&quot; made an apparent suicide dive on &quot;Yorktown&quot;. The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about from her portside.

====Battle of Okinawa====

On 30 March, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive battleship was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive. &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target. Air Group 9 aviators claimed several torpedo hits on &quot;Yamato&quot; just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three bomb hits on the light cruiser sank her also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the Ryūkyūs, but &quot;Yorktown&quot; sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6–7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kyūshū airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on Minami Daito Shima. After the second day&#x27;s strikes, &quot;Yorktown&quot; began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in San Pedro Bay at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.

====End of the war====
The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honshū. After a fueling rendezvous on 11–12 July, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island Hokkaidō. Those strikes lasted from 13 to 15 July. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 July, at which time her aviators attacked the Japanese naval base at Yokosuka. From 19 to 22 July, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 July, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the Kure naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 July, and on 27–28 July, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29–30 July, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8–9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honshū and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.

From 16 to 23 August, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honshū where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender aboard battleship on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied prisoners of war still living in their prison camps. On 16 September, &quot;Yorktown&quot; entered Tokyo Bay with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in Buckner Bay on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.

===Post war===
====1945–1955====

After a non-stop voyage, &quot;Yorktown&quot; entered San Francisco Bay on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to Hunters Point Navy Yard to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in Apra Harbor on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to Samar in the Philippines, she was diverted to Manila en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to Bremerton, Washington, where she was placed in reserve while still in commission, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was decommissioned and was berthed with the Bremerton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.

In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at Puget Sound. On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain William M. Nation in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in Yokosuka, Japan. She put to sea again on 11 September to join TF 77 in the Sea of Japan. The Korean War armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. 

After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, &quot;Yorktown&quot; put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the Academy Award-nominated short subject documentary film &quot;Jet Carrier&quot;. She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8–28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August. &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated out of the Manila-Subic Bay area, conducting 7th Fleet maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the Christmas holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese from the Tachen Islands located near the communist-controlled mainland. &quot;Yorktown&quot; entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23–24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. 

====1955–1960====
On 21 March 1955, she was placed in reserve while still in commission at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she was to receive extensive modifications—most significantly, an angled flight deck to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall, and on 14 October was placed back in full commission. The carrier resumed normal operations along the West Coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953. &quot;Yorktown&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as Sasebo, Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. 

On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December. &quot;Yorktown&quot; resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August. On 1 September, her home port was changed from Alameda to Long Beach, California, and she was reclassified an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation CVS-10. On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958.

She departed the naval ammunition depot at Bangor, Washington, on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8–17 November, &quot;Yorktown&quot; continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu, held by Nationalist Chinese forces. 

During January, she also joined contingency forces off Vietnam during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the Taiwan Strait. The remainder of the deployment—save for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in March—consisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at San Diego on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959. In January 1960, &quot;Yorktown&quot; headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

====1961–1964====
&quot;Yorktown&quot; emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. On 30 March 1961 The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show Season 5 Episode 26 was filmed aboard the Yorktown to commemorate 50 years of US Navy aviation. Tennessee&#x27;s guests were Joe Flynn and the Command and Crew of The USS Yorktown. Then she conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for western Pacific. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. 

On 26 October 1962, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then on to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the Far East. During that deployment, she served as flagship for Carrier Division 19. She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the SEATO ASW exercise, Operation Sea Serpent. The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach. &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived back in her home port on 18 June 1963 and resumed normal operations until the fall, then went into drydock at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard facility at Long Beach Ca. The Yorktown came out of yard in the spring of 1964. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.

====1965–1968====
The 1964 and 1965 deployment brought &quot;Yorktown&quot; her first real involvement in the Vietnam War. In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnam; Anti-Submarine Warfare &quot;ASW&quot; services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka, Japan, to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.

For the remainder of her active career, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 17 February and joined TF 77 on Yankee Station later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing Anti-Submarine Warfare &quot;ASW&quot; and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several &quot;ASW&quot; exercises, including the major SEATO exercise, Operation Sea Imp. The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, Japan, headed home on 15 July. She debarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operations – carrier qualifications and &quot;ASW&quot; exercises – for the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.

On 24 February 1967, &quot;Yorktown&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover &quot;Yorktown&quot; headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide &quot;ASW&quot; and search and rescue &quot;SAR&quot; support for Task Force 71, the contingency force assembled in the wake of the North Korean capture of . She remained on that &#x27;Operation Formation Star&#x27; assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released for other duties, and headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, &quot;Yorktown&quot; did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided &quot;ASW&quot; and &quot;SAR&quot; support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo, Japan, where she stopped from 19 to 21 June before heading back to the United States.

====1968–1975====

&quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; which recreated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In December 1968, she served as the prime recovery ship for the Apollo 8 space mission. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port—Norfolk, Virginia—on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the West Indies until late summer. On 2 September, &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise Operation Peacekeeper. During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and &quot;Yorktown&quot; began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to Brest, France, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, &quot;Yorktown&quot; put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises from 18 October – 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at Kiel, Germany. After that, she stopped at Copenhagen, Denmark, and at Portsmouth, England, before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.

During the first half of 1970, &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the Navy Department approved the donation of &quot;Yorktown&quot; to the Patriot&#x27;s Point Development Authority, Charleston, South Carolina. She was towed from Bayonne, New Jersey, to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

====1975–present====

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

Through most of the 1990s, &quot;Yorktown&quot; housed WSCI-FM, 89.3, a local public radio station, part of the South Carolina Educational Radio Network. WSCI&#x27;s offices and library were inside, while its broadcast booth was in the ship&#x27;s &quot;pri-fly&quot;, primary flight control, the control tower of an aircraft carrier, overlooking the water facing the Charleston peninsula. South Carolina Educational Radio shut down WSCI&#x27;s local broadcasting in 1998.

Patriots Point has continued to grow serving as an embarkation point for Fort Sumter tour boats, home to several other vessels (including the , , &quot;the ship that would not die&quot;;) as well as the Cold War Submarine Memorial, a replica of a Vietnam Support Base, and the museum of the Medal of Honor Society, which is located on &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s hangar deck. On 2 September 2003, &quot;Yorktown&quot; served as the backdrop for the formal announcement of Senator John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy as he sought, and ultimately won, the Democratic nomination for President of the United States for the 2004 election.

On 9 November 2012, Marquette University was scheduled to face Ohio State University on &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s deck in the second annual Carrier Classic college basketball game. Over 8,000 veterans and active duty military men and women attended the game. However, the makeshift courts became too wet with condensation, delaying tip-off. The game was eventually canceled.

In 2015, Collins Engineers, Inc. estimated that $40 million worth of repairs to the ship&#x27;s hull will be required in the near future. The first phase of the project was to remove old fuel from the oil tanks. Approximately 60,000 gallons has been removed as of late 2015.

<text>Toward the Light (in Danish: Vandrer mod Lyset!) is a book that was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1920 by the Danish author Michael Agerskov. The content of the book is said to have been received through intuitive thought-inspiration from the transcendental world by Michael Agerskov&#x27;s wife, Johanne Agerskov, who was an intermediary. Johanne Agerskov was the daughter of the Danish inventor Rasmus Malling-Hansen.

== Inspirations ==
According to them, the couple were inspired by intelligences in the transcendental world. Johanne Agerskov became a mediator. The Agerskovs, together with two other couples, claimed they have had spiritual contact with spirits of the Light during light time séances.

In 1922, Michael Agerskov wrote the story about the events that had led to the creation of the &quot;three fruits&quot; in his book, &quot;Some Psychic Experiences&quot;. In 1938, a letter was sent to all the bishops of Denmark urging the church authorities in Denmark to communicate about God to their congregations and to the public at large.

== Content ==
The first &quot;golden fruit&quot; is a collection of poems written by Danish poets. The book of poems was published by Michael Agerskov in 1915, with the title &quot;Hilsen til Danmark&quot; (&quot;Greetings to Denmark&quot;).

The second &quot;golden fruit&quot; was a religious work called &quot;Toward the Light&quot;, published in 1920. This book was supposedly the result of séances during 1913–1918. The content is divided into several parts. In Ardor&#x27;s Account, the spirit formerly known as Lucifer, tells about the two primeval powers of the universe, the Light and the Darkness. In the Light rested the possibilities of the good, and in the Darkness rested the possibilities of evil. Ardor tells how God and His 12 servants arose from the Light, then God created the Earth.

God&#x27;s angels went to their own planet, not being aware that they had fallen into Darkness. The fallen angels, called &quot;the Eldest&quot;, created the first man and hoped that they would be able to control the Darkness. When the humans died, their spirits arose from their bodies, but the Eldest had not been able to give them thought and a will; they are still alive, but still without consciousness. These &#x27;zombies&#x27; eventually outnumbered the living humans. God gave all the dead spirits wills and thoughts. God later tasked the angels who had remained in his kingdom; the angels who took on the task became the leader of the Youngest. The Eldest decided to work against the Youngest. The leader of the Youngest, who worked with God, was Christ; and the leader of the Eldest, the prince of the darkness, became known as the Devil.

The third &quot;golden fruit&quot; was a book called &quot;The Doctrine of Atonement and the Shorter Road&quot;. In this book, it was written that the spirit that was incarnated as Saul of Tarsus (later, Paul) seeks to dispel the dogma he created as Paul. This spirit said that it was never Jesus&#x27;s nor the Father&#x27;s intention to die in order to save human and fallen spirits. It was written that Christ spent the next 2000 years (until 1912) pursuing his brother. It is stated that Jesus died because people&#x27;s sin put him up to death. The last part is the account of another spirit, who once was incarnated as Ignatius Loyola.

<text>The Gymnopaedia was an annual festival celebrated exclusively in ancient Sparta, which helped to define Spartan identity. It featured generations of naked Spartan men participating in war dancing and choral singing, with a large emphasis placed on age and generational groups. It is believed that celebration of this festival began in 668 BCE to honour a Spartan victory in Thyrea. The festival likely evolved over time to celebrate other Spartan victories such as that over the Argives in the Battle of the Champions. The Gymnopaedia was primarily in honour of Apollo, but also celebrated Artemis and Leto, who served as representations of the childhood which would soon be left behind by the young participants. Though the festival was ritualistic, it should not necessarily be interpreted as religious. Pausanias describes the Gymnopaedia as &quot;a festival which the Lacedaemonians take more seriously than any other&quot; (Paus. 3.11.9).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; derives from the ancient Greek , composed of the words (&quot;gymnos&quot;, &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;unarmed&quot;) and &quot;paedia&quot; from (&quot;pais&quot;, &quot;child&quot; or &quot;youth&quot;).

== Setting ==

=== Time and date ===
The Gymnopaedia took place each year in approximately July. July was the first month of the year for the Spartans as their calendar revolved around the summer solstice. The festival was the first public gathering of the new year for the Spartans. The Gymnopaedia celebrated Apollo, a fitting tribute as he was also the god of civic reunions such as gatherings, and this was the first large gathering of the year. There are conflicting accounts of how many days the Gymnopaedia lasted for, but it is accepted to have been at least three days. The Spartans would have partaken in the festival from dusk until dawn each of these days. The festival came to an end during the full moon which fell closest to the heliacal rising of the star Sirius being visible in Sparta. The festival took place at the hottest time of the year in Sparta, which meant most of the activities happened under very harsh sun.

=== Location ===

The festival lasted for several days and took place in multiple areas, as different sources describe different locations for the activities of the Gymnopaedia. Pausanias writes of an area of the Spartan agora known as the &quot;choros&quot; or &quot;dancing ground&quot; because of the significant role it played in the Gymnopaedia. The &quot;choros&quot; was likely located in the east of the agora where the chorus dances were known to have been performed. Pausanias states that near this area there were statues of Apollo Pythaeus, Artemis, and Leto (Paus 3.11.9). Herodotus (Hdt. 6.67.3), Xenophon (Xen. Hell. 6.4.16), and Plutarch (Plut. Ages. 29.2), each make note of crowds gathering in a &quot;theatre&quot; or &quot;viewing place&quot; for festivals in Sparta; this was likely a place where the public would gather on a slope to view performances on level ground below. Due to how little remains of structures or landmarks in Ancient Sparta we cannot be certain the exact location of the agora or potential &quot;theatres&quot;.

== Celebrations ==
The major element of celebration during the Gymnopaedia was the songs and dances performed by choruses of naked men as a form of competition. The main focus of the festival was the young men who were about to enter adulthood. Because the contests were more symbolic than strictly athletic in nature, they may be interpreted as a ceremonial and initiatory part of the agoge.

Because all of Sparta would gather to partake in or view the events of the Gymnopaedia, it helped to develop a communal identity and sense of being a part of a single group.

=== Choral song and dance ===

The choral groups would dance naked. The songs the young men sang drew attention to the physical maturity they were reaching. Physical ability was an important aspect of becoming a citizen in many Ancient Greek poleis, but Sparta was the only polis which celebrated this so prominently. These celebratory dances took place in a specified area in the agora. 

The practices of song and dance were not reserved for only the young men. In a different area of the city three groups of choruses would gather to perform traditional songs together. They would honour Apollo through songs and performed songs which represented the phases of life. The songs would have been written by famous Spartan poets. Though there were no shows of strength or arms taken up at the festival, the songs still had a militaristic quality. By performing songs with this quality the Spartans could connect the festival to their military exploits. They sang songs described as having a &#x27;boastful&#x27; tone, which were written in iambic trimeter. The same songs would be used each year. 

The choruses were divided into three groups, one for young men or boys coming to maturity, one for men in their prime, and one for old men. There is little surviving evidence of what songs and dance would be performed, but Plutarch writes that at least one element of the performance would involve the old men singing: &quot;We once did deeds of prowess and were strong young men”, to which the men in their prime would sing: “We are so now, and if you wish, behold and see”, followed by the boys singing: “We shall be sometime mightier men by far than both” (Plut. Lyc. 21.2). The three groups competing and interacting with each other helped to place an emphasis on Spartans as a collective, rather than as individual competitors. Scholars consider the actions of the Gymnopaedia to be both a crucial part of Spartan education and a test of endurance for the children coming of age. It was considered as such because of the extremely hot conditions and precisely performed dance moves. 

This aspect of the festival was such a spectacle that non-Spartans would visit Sparta during the Gymnopaedia just to see it.
=== Special garments ===
The leaders of each chorus group would wear a headpiece known as the &quot;feather crown&quot; or &quot;thyreatic crown&quot;. These crowns were made out of palm leaves and were referred to as &quot;feather crowns&quot; due to the leaves resemblance to feathers. The Spartans also used these crowns at other festivals.

== Historical relevance ==

=== Ancient Sparta ===
King Leotychides used the gathering of the Gymnopaedia to deliver an insult to the recently deposed king Demaratus, asking him via messenger what it felt like to hold public office after being a king. He responded calmly that he had experience in both unlike Leotychides himself, also saying that this question would be the beginning of either great fortune or great evil for Sparta. He then left the festival and made a sacrifice to Zeus. (Hdt. 6.67).

The Gymnopaedia was important enough to the Spartans that they would avoid leaving the city even if called on. Thucydides explains an occasion of this in History of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. 5.82). The Argive democrats knew how important the festival was to the Spartans, and waited until the festival began in order to attack the ruling oligarchs who were allied with Sparta. The Spartans eventually postponed the Gymnopaedia, but the oligarchs had already been defeated by this time.

The festival was of such importance to the Spartans that even king Agesilaus participated despite his lameness, but was hidden in the back of the group so no one could see his physical flaws. Xenophon writes that Agesilaus was extremely devoted to religion (Xen. Ages. 3.2), so he would have seen this participation as a duty.

The news of Spartan loss at the battle of Leuctra reached Sparta during the final day of the Gymnopaedia. Despite the large negative effect this news would have on Sparta&#x27;s power, the ephors would not allow any dances to be cancelled or for the celebrations to be changed. When the families of the deceased soldiers had been told of the news, the ephors brought the festival to a close (Plut. Ages. 29. 2-3). Xenophon expands on this information, saying that the ephors instructed the families of the dead to suffer their grief in silence so as not to disrupt the festival. The following day all those who had lost relatives could be seen smiling and being cheerful in public. Those who had family members at the battle who were still living were sad and worried for their loved ones (Xen. Hell. 6.4).

Plutarch says Lichas, a wealthy Spartan, gained fame for entertaining many of the strangers at a &quot;boys gymnastic festival&quot; (Plut. Cim. 10, 5) This festival was interpreted by Xenophon to be the Gymnopaedia.

=== Ancient Greece ===
Plutarch mentions that the city was &quot;full of strangers&quot; during the Gymnopaidia suggesting that non-Spartans and potentially perioikoi would also attend the festival. (Plut. &quot;Ages&quot;. 29.2).

Plato seems to have made a reference praising the effects of the songs and rituals of the gymnopaedia in his work &quot;Laws&quot; (Plat. Laws 633c)&quot;.&quot;
